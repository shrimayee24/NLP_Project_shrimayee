NEW DELHI: Election Commission sources said Wednesday the poll body had no legal authority to investigate the source or quantum of contributions received by a political party, be it a recognised national/state party or a registered unrecognised political party (RUPP).As per Section 29C of Representation of the People Act 1951, a political party must, on an annual basis, file a contribution report with EC, declaring all donations received that are in excess of Rs 20,000. Once the party files the contribution report, an acknowledgement is issued through the chief electoral officer concerned. ""It is the Central Board for Direct Taxes that has the legal mandate to probe the source and extent of contributions received and declared by the political parties,"" an official told TOI. The official added the EC can at most delist a RUPP if it has not contested elections for six straight years or has not filed its contribution reports.","EC has no legal authority to investigate the source or quantum of contributions received by a political party, sources say.

Police said Google Maps had led the vehicle with nine passengers to the bridge, which had been closed for three years, reports Somdutt Tripathi.The accident occurred around 1.30am. Five people were rescued with the help of boats, even as searches continued for the missing minor late into Wednesday night.The nine were all relatives and members of Gadri community from Chittorgarh’s Kanakheda village. They were returning from a visit to Sawai Bhoj temple in neighbouring Bhilwara district, and relied on Google Maps for an alternative route as police had erected barricades on roads leading to flooded areas.The app led them to the closed Somi-Uprera bridge over Banas river, which was in spate due to heavy rains that had battered the region for the past three to four days. When the driver tried to manoeuvre the car across the bridge, the vehicle got stuck in a pothole and was washed away by the strong currents, police said.With trapped passengers screaming for help, many locals rushed to the spot and began rescue efforts with aid from the district administration. While they managed to save five people — including two nine-month-old twins — four others were swept away.","The accident occurred around 1.30am in Rajasthan’s Chittorgarh district.

Want to get elected as VP to protect Constitution: Sudershan Reddy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/want-to-get-elected-as-vp-to-protect-constitution-sudershan-reddy/articleshow/123552318.cms,"PTI file photo

What led you to join the VP post contest in times considered to be highly polarised?

What do you have to say about the talk that numbers are already skewed in favour of NDA?

How do you see HM Amit Shah’s criticism of your judgment on disbanding anti-Maoist Salwa Judum militia, and BJP seeing the verdict through the prism of judicial bias?

What do you have to say on Shah’s criticism of your judgment on eviction of security forces from school buildings where they were lodged as part of anti-Maoist ops?

Your response to the statement of 18 ex-judges supporting you and around 56 others opposing?

What about criticism of ex-judges seeking constitutional posts — ex-CJI Ranjan Gogoi accepting RS nomination and c

oncerns about impartiality of judiciary in 1967 when ex-CJI Subba Rao contested for VP post.

You have been meeting the leaders of various opposition parties. Your response to the contest being framed like a Tamil pride versus Telugu pride? Your reaction to YSRCP supporting the NDA candidate?

Interview of opposition Vice Presidential candidate Justice (retired) B Sudershan Reddy (Excerpts)Society is getting increasingly polarised. This must be stopped because I believe the biggest threat doesn’t come from govts alone in a democracy but the threat comes from citizens themselves when they try to divide society on the basis of religion, caste, language and region. To arrest this tendency I thought of contesting this election.I am a liberal Constitutional democrat and I want to get elected as the VP of the country to defend and protect the Constitution of India. Hitherto my duty was to uphold the Constitution. That is the distinction between the oath administered to a judge and Vice President and President of India.You know there is no whip, political parties as such do not vote. It is the members of the Parliament who vote and it is a secret ballot. Political party business should not enter this arena. Parties may choose their candidate but ultimately voters are the members of Parliament. Therefore, I don’t understand this fight of numbers...I am very optimistic and am going to appeal to all members of all political parties and I will be formally releasing a letter addressing all MPs soon.It is their choice. There are six balls in one over. After the sixth ball nothing remains.I think 5 or 6 are perhaps already over. Some are spinners, some are fast bowlers. Some spin they are trying. The most unfortunate thing is that no one would make such a comment if they have read the judgement. Infact, in the Salwa Judum judgement I was speaking about the menace of violence. I further said that it is the Constitutional duty and obligation of the state to protect the rights and liberty of its citizens. I said you cannot outsource your right to use arms whenever it is necessary to protect the society. I had said please do your duty and do not involve these innocent tribals.In those maoist areas, who are those kids going to school? They have hardly any facilities and whatever schools that were in existence were under the control of security forces depriving the children the right to get educated which is a guaranteed right. Apart from the Right To Education Act even the Constitution gives them that right. Should I presume that the mighty state is unable to provide accomodation to its security forces and occupied the school and college buildings. What is it that I said? You have taken away the school building, let the school be run.If a judge discharges his Constitutional obligation, interpreting the Constitution as per law as established can be dubbed and characterised as a bias tomorrow. God,...if there is one, save this country.What do I say about it? When I say divisive forces are at work this is what I meant. I must thank the 56 colleagues - authors of this text who may have signed or not...they gave me unsolicited advice that it is a political contest, you face it. I never asked them if it is a political contest or not because I have been repeatedly saying that it is a high Constitutional office.I won’t speak about any specific person. I am not asking anyone to nominate me. I am seeking an election appealing to MPs to consider my candidature on merit. Former CJI Subba Rao was attacked for writing the Golaknath judgment where you find the origin and basis of formulating that fundamental rights cannot be altered by Parliament. There is a foundation laid in that very judgment about the basic structure. Later, Kesavananda Bharati merely clarified that no it is not as if no part of the Constitution can be amended. ..it is not as if no part of fundamental rights can be amended but the Constitution’s basic structure cannot be amended. Those perhaps who believed at that time that anything and everything can be amended and that Justice Rao through Golaknath was coming in the way, therefore they unleashed an attack.In Salwa Judum, I was talking about social justice, the ideals enshrined in the Preamble, civil rights and liberties of the people and a Constitutional doctrine that the State alone has the monopoly to use weapons to quell violence. It cannot hire the services of an organised group. The moment you speak about some values in the Constitution, it is not palatable to some, they start spinning it.Ans: This nation is one. India that is Bharat is a union of states. There is no separate citizenship for Tamil Nadu and Telangana. Neither Shri CP Radhakrishnan ji has chosen to be born in Tamil Nadu nor Justice Sudershan Reddy chose to be born in Telangana. So there is nothing like Telangana versus Tamil Nadu. As far as YSRCP is concerned it is their political leadership’s choice but I don’t know what their MPs will do as there is no whip and it is a secret ballot. Therefore, why should I not appeal to everyone to consider my candidature for vice president when they vote.","Justice (retired) B Sudershan Reddy says society is getting increasingly polarised.

Pakistan Link In Pahalgam Confirmed: Funeral Of Attacker Neutralized In Op Mahadev Held In Pok

NEW DELHI: Operation Sindoor and Operation Mahadev, which saw Indian security personnel avenge the Pahalgam terror attack with targeted hits on Pakistani territory as well as the elimination of three Pakistani terrorists who had killed 26 innocent Indians in cold blood, have sent a clear message to the Pakistan-based terror masterminds about “the consequences of playing with lives of Indian citizens,” home minister Amit Shah said here on Wednesday.The comments came during Shah’s meeting here with Operation Mahadev bravehearts from the Indian Army , CRPF and Jammu and Kashmir police; during which he felicitated them on the successful neutralisation of Pahalgam mastermind Suleiman alias Faisal Jatt and his accomplices Afghan and Jibran, in an encounter in Dachigam forest area on the outskirts of Srinagar. “Technical analysis by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) conclusively established that the terrorists killed in Operation Mahadev were the ones who had unleashed the mayhem in Pahalgam,” said Shah.As part of Operation Mahadev, Indian Army para commandos, along with CRPF and J&K Police, had on July 28 eliminated the three Pahalgam attackers after cornering them in their temporary hideout, ending a long and painstaking manhunt to deliver justice to the 26 victims of Pahalgam attack.“I congratulate all the security personnel on behalf of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the public, for having fortified the sense of security among countrymen,” Shah told them.He noted that the personnel had shown the world that terrorists, irrespective of the change in tactics and strategy, cannot escape unscatched after harming Indian interests.Stating that Pahalgam attack was an attempt to derail the ‘Kashmir mission’ — defined by restoration of normalcy and boosting of development in the Valley — when tourism was at its peak, the home minister said the people of India were content with Operation Sindoor but this satisfaction turned into self-confidence with Operation Mahadev.“This trust in security forms the foundation of aspirations to see India take the lead globally, in every field,” said the home minister.Shah underlined that J&K police now take the lead in joint anti-terror operations conducted along with the Army and CAPFs in Kashmir.“Operation Sindoor and Operation Mahadev instilled a sense of joy and enthusiasm among those in power and the Opposition alike; both the sides expressed gratitude towards the forces,” Shah told the Operation Mahadev heroes.","Home minister Amit Shah felicitated Operation Mahadev bravehearts on successful neutralisation of Pahalgam mastermind Suleiman alias Faisal Jatt and his accomplices Afghan and Jibran. “Technical analysis by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) conclusively established that the terrorists killed in OperationMahadev were the ones who had unleashed the mayhem,” said Shah.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123549856,imgsize-41230,width-400,resizemode-4/123549856.jpg"

What we know about the shooter



After the tragic shooting at a Minneapolis Catholic school mass Wednesday, the police confirmed that the suspect who killed himself after opening fire at the morning mass was a male in his 20s. While the police did not reveal the alleged shooter's name, social media was abuzz with speculations that the person was Robin Westman, who posted a disturbing video on YouTube before the shooting. The video had details of the church where the shooting took place.

The shooter had three weapons -- rifle, shotgun and pistol. He approached the side of the church and shot dozens of rounds through the windows toward the children sitting in the pews during Mass at the Annunciation Catholic School. “This was a deliberate act of violence against innocent children and other people worshipping.

Arrests and investigation

Calls for wider probe

NEW DELHI: In a major twist in the probe into the Nikki Bhati death case, Noida Police have claimed that the woman told doctors she suffered burns in a cylinder blast.""The doctor said it was Nikki who told them she was burnt after a gas cylinder blast, which was also recorded in the hospital's memo,"" the officer said.The statement contrasts sharply with the allegation by her sister Kanchan that Nikki was set on fire by her husband Vipin after years of harassment.Nikki, who died on 21 August, had been married into a Sirsa-based family.The case has become increasingly complex with the emergence of multiple videos and conflicting testimonies.CCTV footage from a shop near Nikki’s house appeared to show her husband standing outside at the time of the incident.Another video, believed to have been recorded by Nikki’s sister Kanchan, captures a woman’s voice asking, “What have you done?” Police are now verifying whether the voice was Kanchan’s.Kanchan, who is married to Vipin’s elder brother and lives in the same house, has maintained that Nikki accused her husband of setting her on fire.She has also shared screenshots of Vipin’s alleged conversations with other women, questioning why a single CCTV clip has turned public opinion in his favour.“It’s such a shame that just one CCTV footage has turned the entire matter around… Those who say she did this herself to trap him should first try burning their own hand to prove their point,” she wrote on Instagram.Vipin, along with his parents Daya and Satveer and elder brother Rohit, has been arrested. All face charges of murder and dowry harassment.Another video that surfaced shows Nikki’s mother-in-law separating her from Vipin during a quarrel and even slapping her son when he raised his hand at Nikki.Police say they are trying to determine when this footage was filmed.A further clip shows Vipin’s father performing Nikki’s last rites.Sources say the cremation took place early the morning after her death, before Nikki’s family lodged a formal complaint.Nikki’s cousin Sunny Payla has urged police to retrieve footage from CCTV cameras inside the family home, arguing these would give a clearer picture of events.“Vipin’s family has conveniently circulated footage from a shop opposite their house. It does not show what happened inside that day,” he said.Police officials say they have recorded 10-12 statements from both families and are now piecing together the sequence of events.“We will cross-verify all statements. The sequence of events is being established. We are going to do a thorough investigation,” an officer told reporters.For now, investigators say re-examining Kanchan will be key to resolving contradictions at the heart of the case.",Nikki Bhati died on 21 August.

MUMBAI: At least 13 people have been killed after a residential building collapsed in Virar East, on the outskirts of Mumbai, late on Tuesday night.Officials said one section of Ramabai Apartment came crashing down during the intervening night of Tuesday and Wednesday, trapping several residents.The collapse occurred as a birthday party was under way on the fourth floor, according to locals.Rescue teams from the fire brigade, police, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and ambulance services were deployed to the site.Operations to search for survivors and recover bodies continued into Wednesday.Virar, located in Maharashtra’s Palghar district, is part of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region and has witnessed several incidents of building collapses in recent years, raising questions over construction quality and housing safety.In the wake of the tragedy, Vasai Virar City Municipal Corporation (VVCMC) announced a landmark decision to recognise flat owners of the collapsed building as having “other rights” (Itar Hakk) in property records.Municipal commissioner Manoj Suryavanshi said the move would ensure that residents’ names are added to land documents alongside the landowners, giving them legal standing in property-related decisions.“Wewill explore the legalities to pass a resolution adding their names in land documents so that their rights are maintained,” he said, adding that the civic body would push for maximum assistance from both VVCMC and the state government.Deputy municipal commissioner Deepak Sawant said proof of residence certificates would be issued soon to the affected families and steps taken to formalise their claims in official property records.The Jovil family was celebrating the first birthday of their daughter when the slab collapsed. The one-year-old, Utkarsha Omkar Jovil, died during treatment. Her mother, 23-year-old Aarohi, was killed instantly in the collapse.The father, 25-year-old Omkar, is still missing and believed to be under the debris, while some visiting relatives are also feared trapped.Two NDRF teams — one from Mumbai and another from Palghar — were deployed to the site. “When we arrived around midnight, we removed four from the debris, out of which one small girl died. So far, we have removed around 11 from the debris and continue to search for more,” said Pramod Singh, Deputy Commander, NDRF.Palghar Collector Indurani Jakhar confirmed that 11 people had been rescued by morning, two of whom later died. Heavy machinery was brought in only after evacuating adjoining structures, as manual clearing was carried out through the night to avoid further damage. Nearby chawls and neighbouring buildings have been evacuated as a precaution.Locals have told officials that at least 10 more people could still be trapped.Residents said the building, constructed illegally in 2012–13, had long been declared unsafe. Notices were served by the Vasai Virar City Municipal Corporation (VVCMC), but residents allege the developer ignored them.Local resident Tukaram Shinde, who had lived in Ramabai Apartment for 13 years, said: “The developer received three notices from the civic body, but nothing was done.Last week even a staircase collapsed and a social worker warned the builder that the structure could fall. But it was ignored.”Residents had been pushing for redevelopment but claimed both the landowner and the developer resisted due to costs. Many escaped the collapse with nothing but the clothes they were wearing.Virar police confirmed that they have arrested Nittal Gopinath Sane, 47, owner of Sai Dutta Builders and Developers, who constructed the building.He has been booked under the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning (MRTP) Act, 1966 and Section 105 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (culpable homicide not amounting to murder).“We have arrested Nittal Sane and will produce him before Vasai court on Thursday,” said Senior PI Lalu Ture of Virar police station.The delayed action — more than a decade after the illegal structure was built — has triggered anger. Lawyer and Shiv Sena leader Anil Chavan questioned why the VVCMC waited until tragedy struck to act. He demanded that the Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors (MPID) Act be invoked against such developers so their assets can be seized and sold, with proceeds returned to affected buyers.“Will the civic body wait for other buildings to collapse before booking illegal builders? When will residents finally get safe homes — or compensation to buy one?” he asked.The collapse has reignited concerns about dozens of other unsafe and illegally constructed buildings in Vasai-Virar. Civic negligence, delayed enforcement, and unregulated urban growth have left thousands of families living in precarious structures — and fearing they could be the next victims.","One section of Ramabai Apartment came crashing down during the intervening night of Tuesday and Wednesday, trapping several residents.

How Microsoft responded to the protests

Previous protests against Microsoft

Microsoft has temporarily locked down a building at its Redmond headquarters after protesters entered the office of company president Brad Smith. According to a report by The Verge, the protestors stormed Smith’s office and staged a sit-in, demanding the tech giant cut ties with the Israeli government. Both current and former Microsoft workers streamed the protest on Twitch, walking into Building 34 that houses top executives, and then into Smith’s office. The protests forced President Brad Smith to host an emergency conference where he informed reporters that the software giant is ""working every day to get to the bottom of what’s going on"".As per the report, the protestors unfurled banners and shouted “Brad Smith you can’t hide, you’re supporting genocide!”. Balloons with noisemakers were tied in the building’s entrance, with one such notice reading: “The People’s Court Summons Bradford Lee Smith on Charges of Crimes Against Humanity.”Abdo Mohamed, a No Azure for Apartheid organizer and former Microsoft worker, confirmed to The Verge that Microsoft employees Riki Fameli and Anna Hattle joined the sit-in, alongside former workers Vaniya Agrawal, Hossam Nasr, and Joe Lopez.This protest comes less than a week after police arrested Hattle, Agrawal, Nasr, and Lopez during another demonstration at Microsoft headquarters. Redmond police claimed some protesters became aggressive during that earlier action.After the protest, Microsoft president Brad Smith hosted a press conference, where he addressed a group of reporters and viewers on a live stream. “Obviously, this was an unusual day,” he said, adding Microsoft is “committed to ensuring its human rights principles and contractual terms of service are upheld in the Middle East.”He further revealed that seven people in total were involved in the latest protests, with two of them being Microsoft employees.“When seven folks do as they did today, storm a building, occupy an office, lock other people out of the office, plant listening devices — even in crude form, in the form of telephones, cellphones hidden under couches and behind books — that’s not ok,” Smith said. “When they’re asked to leave and they refused, that’s not ok.”“We are working every day to get to the bottom of what’s going on, and we will,” Smith further added.The group No Azure for Apartheid has been organizing repeated protests against Microsoft’s cloud contracts with the Israeli government. Earlier this year, activists disrupted Microsoft’s 50th anniversary event, where a former employee called AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman a “war profiteer.”","Microsoft has temporarily locked down a building at its Redmond headquarters after protesters entered the office of company president Brad Smith.

American ‘influence ops’ in Greenland? Denmark summons US diplomat over alleged campaign; PM calls 'interference unacceptable',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/american-influence-ops-in-greenland-denmark-summons-us-diplomat-over-alleged-campaign-pm-calls-interference-unacceptable/articleshow/123553517.cms,"Denmark PM Mette Frederiksen (left) , US President Donald Trump (rigth)

Denmark has summoned the US chargé d’affaires Mark Stroh following allegations that American citizens with ties to Donald Trump attempted to carry out an influence campaign in Greenland.The move came after an investigation by Danish broadcaster DR, which reported that at least three Americans linked to Trump and his circle had sought to infiltrate Greenlandic society. According to DR, the men attempted to sway local opinion in favour of Trump’s long-standing ambition of annexing the island,Danish foreign minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen denounced the reports as “totally unacceptable,” stressing that Copenhagen would make it “very clear” to Washington that any state-backed campaign of this kind would violate international norms. “It is important that both Greenlanders and Danes understand what we are up against,” he said.Prime minister Mette Frederiksen also voiced concern, describing the allegations as “very serious.” She warned that “any interference in the internal affairs of the Kingdom of Denmark, and in Greenlandic democracy, is unacceptable,” while noting that US officials had not clearly denied the substance of DR’s findings.Trump’s interest in Greenland has long been a source of tension between Washington and Copenhagen. In 2019, he suggested the US should buy the territory — a proposal flatly rejected by both Denmark and Greenland. The island enjoys self-rule, though foreign and security policy remain under Danish control.The US State Department confirmed on Wednesday that chargé d’affaires Mark Stroh met Danish officials at their request. A spokesperson said the discussion was “productive” and reaffirmed “the strong ties among the governments of Greenland, the United States, and Denmark.” However, the spokesperson maintained that Washington could not comment on the actions of “private US citizens,” adding that the American government “does not control or direct” them. “The United States respects the right of the people of Greenland to determine their own future,” the statement added.According to Danish broadcaster DR, three unnamed American men were suspected of attempting to infiltrate Greenlandic society in a bid to weaken its ties with Denmark through what officials described as “infiltration” and “influence operations.”One of the men, who had been publicly seen with Donald Trump on several occasions, was alleged to have compiled a list of the US president’s supporters in Greenland, as well as those opposed to him. He was also accused of advising on issues that cast Denmark in a negative light in the US media.Rasmussen reiterated Denmark’s position that “any attempt to interfere” in its internal affairs would not be tolerated. He emphasised that Copenhagen’s cooperation with Nuuk was built on “close dialogue and mutual trust,” and that the two governments remained united on the issue.","Denmark summons US chargé d'affaires Mark Stroh following allegations of influence campaign in Greenland.

Trump Furious As Israel Hits Gaza Hospital; Bashes Bibi After 20 Kids, Journalists Killed

President Donald Trump on Wednesday (local time) chaired a 'policy meet' to hold discussions on the future of Gaza at the White House, which was breifed by former UK prime minister Tony Blair and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who presented ideas for a 'post-war' plan.While the specifics of the 'plan' remain unclear, the talks centred on governance, humanitarian assistance and security arrangements in Gaza, including talks on boosting food aid deliveries, resolving the hostage crisis, and shaping proposals for Gaza’s future once the conflict ends, were discussed for over an hour, according to Reuters.Jared Kushner, who is married to Trump's daughter Ivanka, was a key architect of Trump’s Middle East policy during his first term but does not hold a formal role in the current administration, has been informally advising White House officials since Trump returned to office in January.The session was also attended by US foreign envoy Steve Witkoff and other senior administration aides.Ahead of the talks, Witkoff had told Fox News that Trump would convene “a large meeting” on Gaza. “It is a very comprehensive plan we are putting together on the next day (in Gaza), and many people are going to see how robust it is and how well-meaning it is. It reflects President Trump’s humanitarian motives here,” he said.He also suggested the administration believes the war could end by the end of this year.Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu is under growing pressure from protesters and the country’s military leadership to agree to a ceasefire and hostage release deal, instead of pushing ahead with his plan to broaden the military offensive.Witkoff has been in regular contact with Blair and Kushner for several months over the post-war strategy, reported Axios. Blair had met Witkoff at the White House in July — the same day Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu conferred with Trump, before briefing Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on the discussions in Washington.The details of Trump’s post-war blueprint remain unclear, particularly on how Gaza’s reconstruction would be carried out and who would ultimately oversee the enclave’s governance.","Donald Trump holds meeting on Gaza City post-war plan.

Susan Monarez has resigned as director of the US centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) just weeks after formally assuming the role, The New York Times reported, citing sources familiar with the matter.Monarez, an infectious disease researcher and the first non-physician to lead the agency in over 50 years, reportedly stepped down following disagreements with health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr, particularly over changes to the CDC's vaccine advisory panel.According to individuals who spoke to the portal on the condition of anonymity, Monarez had clashed with Kennedy over his decision to remove and replace members of the influential immunization policy committee with individuals critical of existing vaccine guidelines.Her short tenure coincided with significant restructuring at the CDC, including workforce reductions, budget cuts, and the elimination of some core agency functions. She had previously served as acting director since President Donald Trump took office and was confirmed after the president withdrew his earlier nominee, Dr. David Weldon.Dr. Monarez was reportedly required to coordinate policy decisions with both Matt Buckham, chief of staff at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and Matt Buzelli, chief of staff at the CDC.Last week, HHS appointed a vocal critic of COVID-19 vaccines to lead a subcommittee on vaccine safety, sparking concern among public health professionals. Meanwhile, CDC employees issued an open letter urging Kennedy to stop promoting what they called ""inaccurate information"" about vaccines.Monarez appeared to support their concerns, expressing worry about misinformation in an internal note, though without directly naming Kennedy.She had also received praise from CDC staff for her empathetic leadership following a recent shooting at the CDC’s Atlanta headquarters, in which a gunman—believed to be motivated by anti-vaccine beliefs—killed a police officer and fired on the building.As of now, no official comment has been provided by the department of health and human services.","Susan Monarez, an infectious disease researcher and the first non-physician to lead the agency in over 50 years, reportedly stepped down following disagreements with health secretary Robert F.

IAEA in Iran: First since US strikes; Tehran threatens sanctions can derail cooperation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/iaea-resumes-inspections-in-iran-amid-tensions-and-threats-of-sanctions/articleshow/123552035.cms,"Rafael Grossi (AP)

UN nuclear inspectors have resumed limited work in Iran, visiting the Bushehr nuclear facility for the first time since Tehran suspended cooperation with the international atomic energy agency (IAEA) in June. The visit, confirmed on Wednesday by IAEA chief Rafael Grossi, marks a partial resumption of inspections but falls short of full access across Iran's nuclear infrastructure, reported news agency AFP""Today they are inspecting Bushehr,"" Grossi said, as quoted by AFP. However, he cautioned that broader site access, including to facilities targeted in June airstrikes, remains unresolved.Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi told state television that ""no final text has yet been approved on the new cooperation framework with the IAEA and views are being exchanged,"" as quoted by the agency.Inspectors had withdrawn from Iran following joint strikes by Israel and the United States on June 13, which targeted key nuclear and military facilities and reportedly killed over 1,000 people. Iran retaliated with drone and missile attacks, and a ceasefire has been in place since June 24.Under Iran’s law limiting nuclear oversight, IAEA inspectors may only access sites with approval from the supreme national security council.For now, Iran says its cooperation will take “a new form,” with inspections restricted to specific tasks—such as overseeing fuel replacement at Bushehr, according to Behrouz Kamalvandi, spokesperson for Iran's Atomic Energy Organization.Grossi, currently visiting Washington, said Iran must allow access to all sites, including those hit during the attacks. “There is no such thing as a la carte inspection work,” he noted, calling the ongoing discussions a “litmus test” of diplomatic intent.Meanwhile, Iran’s diplomats met representatives from Britain, France, and Germany in Geneva to discuss the potential triggering of UN ""snapback"" sanctions under the 2015 nuclear deal. The window to reimpose these sanctions closes on October 18.Iran has warned that if the snapback mechanism is activated, ongoing engagement with the IAEA could be fully halted. Deputy foreign minister Karim Gharibabadi said, “The path of interaction that we have now opened with the international atomic energy agency will also be completely affected and will probably stop.”Russia has introduced a draft UN resolution to delay the snapback deadline by six months, with Moscow calling it a test of countries’ willingness to pursue diplomacy.“This will be kind of a litmus test for those who really want to uphold diplomatic efforts,” said Russia’s deputy UN ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy.","IAEA inspectors have resumed limited work in Iran, visiting Bushehr nuclear facility for the first time since Tehran suspended cooperation with the international atomic energy agency in June.

US restaurant chain Cracker Barrel announced Tuesday it will restore its original logo after a week-long backlash from customers and political leaders, including President Donald Trump, who criticised its recent rebrand.The Lebanon, Tennessee-based chain confirmed in a statement on its website that it would keep its traditional emblem featuring an elderly man in overalls, known as “Uncle Herschel,” sitting next to a barrel alongside the words “Old Country Store.” “We thank our guests for sharing your voices and love for Cracker Barrel. Our new logo is going away and our ‘Old Timer’ will remain,” the company said.The controversy began last week when Cracker Barrel introduced a simplified text-only design as part of an effort to modernise its 660 restaurants across 43 states and appeal to younger customers.However, the shift sparked a culture war backlash online, with critics branding the move “woke.”The company’s shares, which had slumped after the rebrand, rebounded following the announcementOn Monday, Cracker Barrel issued an apologetic statement saying it “could have done a better job sharing who we are and who we’ll always be.” By Tuesday morning, Trump weighed in on Truth Social, urging the chain to revert to its old design, describing customer feedback as “the ultimate Poll.”Hours later, the company confirmed the reversal.Trump celebrated the decision, writing: “Congratulations ‘Cracker Barrel’ on changing your logo back to what it was. All of your fans very much appreciate it. Good luck into the future. Make lots of money and, most importantly, make your customers happy again!”As per ABC News, Cracker Barrel stressed it would continue honouring its long-standing traditions, including the porch rocking chairs and menu favourites tied to Uncle Herschel’s legacy. “At Cracker Barrel, it’s always been – and always will be – about serving up delicious food, warm welcomes, and the kind of country hospitality that feels like family,” the company said.The White House also joined the mockery by sharing a spoofed logo on X with a caption “Go woke, go broke”. The image shared featured Trump in place of Uncle Herschel with the words “America First” and the slogan “AMERICA IS BACK.”Despite CEO Julie Masino’s earlier defence of modernisation, Cracker Barrel’s climbdown reflects the strength of its loyal customer base. The chain said its 70,000 employees now look forward to “welcoming you to our table soon.”","US restaurant chain Cracker Barrel announced Tuesday it will restore its original logo after a week-long backlash.

A federal grand jury has declined to indict a former US justice department employee who was caught on video throwing a sandwich at a customs and border protection (CBP) agent during a protest in Washington, DC, according to CNN citing a person familiar with the matter.Sean Charles Dunn, previously an international affairs specialist in the justice department’s criminal division, was arrested on assault charges shortly after the August 2020 incident. He was later fired from his job.The episode, which occurred in the early days of President Donald Trump’s federal law enforcement deployment in DC, was captured on video and widely circulated. It shows Dunn throwing a sub-style sandwich at the agent’s chest after reportedly shouting, “Why are you here? I don’t want you in my city!”According to a police affidavit, Dunn pointed his finger in the agent’s face, used profanities, and attempted to flee before being apprehended. Though initially released, he was rearrested by federal agents. A video of that arrest was later posted by an official White House social media account.Grand jurors meet behind closed doors to determine whether enough evidence exists to proceed with felony charges. While prosecutors could re-present the case, the grand jury’s refusal is significant, especially amid criticism of the federal handling of arrests during Trump’s law enforcement surge, which resulted in over 1,000 arrests.Defense lawyers and at least one magistrate judge have questioned the federal government’s role in cases typically managed by local authorities. In a separate instance, prosecutors dropped a case after a man was jailed for a week, prompting a judge to label the search involved “the most illegal” he had seen.In another related case, three separate grand juries declined to indict a woman accused of assaulting an FBI agent near the DC jail. Prosecutors are now pursuing a lesser misdemeanor assault charge against her.A spokesperson for US attorney Jeanine Pirro’s office, which is handling Dunn’s case, declined to comment. Dunn’s lawyer also refused to provide a statement.","Sean Charles Dunn, previously an international affairs specialist in the justice department’s criminal division, was arrested on assault charges shortly after the August 2020 incident.

Trump’s Immigration Detention Soars Past Records With Secret Sites, Private Prisons, And New Camps

A decorated US Army veteran was arrested on Monday after burning an American flag near the White House, in what he described as a peaceful protest against an executive order recently signed by President Donald Trump.The incident occurred at Lafayette Square, where the veteran, Jay Carey, was taken into custody by US Park Police and charged under a law prohibiting fires on federal parkland, according to The Washington Post.Carey, 54, said the act was an expression of his first amendment right to protest.“It was my right as a citizen … under the First Amendment to protest in whatever way I see fit without hurting anybody,” Carey said in a phone interview the following day, as quoted by the post.The protest came shortly after Trump signed an order directing federal agencies to ""vigorously prosecute"" individuals who desecrate the US flag. Carey, who served 20 years in the Army and was awarded a Bronze Star during the Iraq War, said he burned the flag to oppose what he called an unconstitutional move.“That he does not have the right, and he’s not allowed to make these illegal rules and laws just because he’s the president,” he said.Carey clarified that the act was not intended to disrespect the flag but to challenge perceived overreach. “People have the right to exercise the rights that have been given to them by this government,” he added, reported the post.Video footage of the event shows Carey pouring rubbing alcohol on the flag and setting it alight while addressing a crowd of about two dozen onlookers. He told them the executive order was illegal and that he had “fought for every single one of [their] rights.”Carey was released after around four hours in custody and is awaiting a court summons. He said he hopes the federal government pursues charges under the executive order so the matter can be escalated to the “highest court.”The US Supreme Court ruled in 1989 that flag burning is protected symbolic speech, though Trump has argued that such acts can lead to unrest.“When you burn the American flag, it incites riots at levels we’ve never seen before,” Trump said during the signing of the order.Carey, who previously ran in a Democratic congressional primary and has participated in public protests, said he intends to challenge the order in court. “We’ll fight this and we’ll win this,” he said. “But if I go to jail for a year, I go to jail for a year. I’ve deployed in combat zones for longer than that.”","Jay Carey, a decorated US Army veteran, was arrested on Monday after burning an American flag near the White House.

Americans Protest As Abrego Garcia Falls Into ICE Hands; New Fight Erupts Against Deportations

A federal judge in the United States has temporarily blocked the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man previously removed from the country under the Trump administration, and has scheduled an evidentiary hearing for October 6.US district judge Paula Xinis on Wednesday ordered that Abrego Garcia remain in the US until she rules on the matter, which is expected within 30 days of the hearing. He is currently in the custody of immigration and customs enforcement (ICE), according to a report by CNN.The October hearing is expected to include testimony from Trump admin officials to determine whether the government followed its own procedures in attempting to deport Abrego Garcia again. He was previously deported to El Salvador in March, where he was held in a high-security prison, before being returned to the US to face human smuggling charges.Despite the ongoing legal proceedings, government efforts to deport him again are underway. The Trump administration is reportedly seeking to remove him to Uganda, but Abrego Garcia is now undergoing a credible fear interview with immigration officials. If he is found to credibly fear persecution or torture in Uganda, US officials would be required to seek another country for removal.Justice department lawyer Drew Ensign told the court the screening process could take at least two weeks.Abrego Garcia is also pursuing a renewed asylum claim in a separate case that will be heard by an immigration judge.","A federal judge has temporarily blocked the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man previously removed from the country under the Trump administration.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s flood emergency deepened on Wednesday as the Ravi, Sutlej and Chenab rivers swelled to dangerous levels, forcing thousands from their homes across Punjab.Evacuations have been carried out in several districts, with Kartarpur Sahib gurdwara inundated and Lahore bracing for rising waters.The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) confirmed that engineer and infantry units were deployed, with helicopters on standby once weather conditions improve. Officials said the operation has so far saved more than 28,000 people across Punjab, though two soldiers lost their lives during relief efforts.Lahore faces its own danger. The Ravi has risen sharply, and officials have issued evacuation advisories for riverside settlements. Residents of Shahdara and adjoining low-lying housing societies have been told to vacate immediately. District authorities warned that floodwaters could inundate colonies built close to the riverbank, and emergency shelters have been set up.The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has declared very high to exceptionally high flood levels in the Ravi, Sutlej and Chenab.At Marala, Khanki and Qadirabad headworks, the Chenab is flowing well above danger levels, while the Sutlej continues to inundate Kasur district around Ganda Singh Wala.Besides Lahore and Narowal, large-scale evacuations are underway in Sialkot, Okara, Hafizabad, Pakpattan, Bahawalnagar and Vehari. Tens of thousands have moved out of riverine “katcha” areas, with livestock and belongings in tow. Authorities say dam releases upstream and record rainfall in Punjab have compounded the crisis. The National Disaster Management Authority has cautioned that swollen tributaries will feed into the Indus river, putting Sindh province at risk of very high floods around September 4-5. Pre-evacuations of riverbank communities in Sindh have been ordered.","Flood emergency deepens as Ravi, Sutlej and Chenab rivers swell to dangerous levels.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Big Op Sindoor Lie Claims India Begged For Ceasefire, Trump Stepped In





ISLAMABAD: Nearly 100 days after Indian fighter jets pounded “terror bases” in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), local police said they have arrested a man who allegedly passed on the GPS coordinates of a mosque that was among those hit.The May 6 raids had left the Bilal Mosque in Muzaffarabad badly damaged, with three fatalities reported. Now, PoK police say Obaid Jahangir of Rawalakot “sold out” by sharing its exact GPS location with India over WhatsApp, allegedly for money.Obaid has been booked under the draconian Official Secrets Act, 1923, with police claiming they had recovered “hard evidence” of espionage. “He passed on sensitive images and the mosque’s coordinates in exchange for hefty payments,” claimed SSP Riaz Mughal of PoK police’s counter-terrorism department (CTD).But the case is already mired in conflicting narratives. Another senior CTD officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, went further, alleging Jahangir had a past with a banned outfit before joining a so-called relief organisation. Investigators, he added, had traced communications with Indian handlers on his phone.The family, however, insists Obaid is no militant. His uncle admitted the 30-something may have “fallen into a money trap” but stressed he was only associated with the Jammu Kashmir United Movement, a relief body.“If he is guilty, he should face the law, but he has never been part of any militant outfit,” the uncle maintained.His lawyer, Abdul Samad, pointed out that the sections invoked against him cover trespassing into restricted areas and passing on information “prejudicial to national security”. Conviction under these clauses carries punishments ranging from 14 years in prison to life.Earlier this year, too, PoK police had arrested a police constable on charges of selling sensitive information across the border.","Indian fighter jets pounded ‘terror bases’ in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) Nearly 100 days later, local police said they have arrested a man who allegedly passed on the GPS coordinates of a mosque.

Pakistan blaze: Fireworks warehouse explosion injures at least 25; fire triggers road closures in Karachi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-blaze-fireworks-warehouse-explosion-injures-at-least-25-fire-triggers-road-closures-in-karachi/articleshow/123434002.cms,"



At least 25 people, including some in critical condition, were injured after an explosion took place at a fireworks storage facility in Karachi, Pakistan.Thick smoke could be seen billowing into the sky from the building where firecrackers were stored, according to television footage.Witnesses cited by AP said that broken glass from nearby shops covered the road and panicked residents fled the scene.Firefighters rushed to extinguish the blaze while ambulances ferried the injured, including passers-by, to hospitals.Senior police official Asad Raza said several shops and vehicles on Jinnah Road were damaged in the blast. The cause of the explosion was not immediately known.The fire was reported in a warehouse near Taj Complex on MA Jinnah Road, a Rescue 1122 spokesperson said, adding,“as soon as Rescue 1122’s Central Command and Control team received the information, the Fire and Rescue team reached the scene along with an ambulance and two fire brigade trucks.”Police surgeon Summaiya Syed told Dawn, “Sixteen injured at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre [with] two critical. Fourteen at Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Trauma Centre,” adding that the warehouse had been storing firecrackers.Karachi traffic police said MA Jinnah Road had been closed due to the fire, with traffic from Numaish being diverted towards Society Signal and Ali Raza Imambargah.Citizens were advised to call the Traffic Police helpline at 1915 for alternate routes “to avoid inconvenience,” the Dawn reported.Sindh CM Murad Ali Shah took notice of the incident and directed officials to control the blaze and ensure no lives were lost. According to a statement, he also ordered the Karachi Commissioner to provide immediate medical assistance to the injured and submit a detailed report. “There is no permission to produce materials near cities or populated areas which can cause damage,” CM Murad was quoted as saying.The Sindh home ministry later issued a statement saying 20 people had been injured in the blaze.Home minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar directed police reinforcements to the scene, saying, “Police reinforcements should be sent to rescue the injured and transfer them quickly to the nearest hospital. An investigation must be completed and a report submitted soon.”Lanjar also instructed investigators to include statements from the injured and evidence from the scene, Dawn furthed added.Explosions at fireworks facilities are not uncommon in Pakistan. In January, six people were killed in a similar blast at a fireworks storage site in Mandi Bahauddin, Punjab province. Fires in commercial and residential buildings are also frequent, largely blamed on poor infrastructure, weak enforcement of safety rules, and negligence.","At least 25 people, including some in critical condition, injured after explosion at fireworks storage facility in Karachi, Pakistan.

Targeting Ahmadiyya community



Blasphemy accusations







The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has raised alarm over violence against minority communities in the country.HRCP on Thursday released its latest report, Streets of Fear: Freedom of Religion or Belief in 2024/25, documenting violations of freedom of religion or belief (FORB) between 1 July 2024 and 30 June 2025.The report painted a picture as grim as in previous years, recording targeted killings, forced conversions, mob lynchings, hate speech, desecration of places of worship and extrajudicial killings. It also warned that religious freedom in Pakistan is facing an unprecedented threat.The HRCP highlighted several cases where individuals were killed over blasphemy accusations, describing the trend as deeply troubling in a country that has already witnessed the assassination of a provincial governor by his own security guard.The HRCP report noted that the pattern of minor non-Muslim girls disappearing and later resurfacing after allegedly converting to Islam and marrying Muslim men persisted in 2024/25.Hindus in Sindh, who form 8.8% of the population, and Christians in Punjab (1.9%), have raised repeated concerns. A fact-finding study found that forced conversions and coerced marriages remain most prevalent among Scheduled Caste Hindus due to poverty and limited social mobility.The report highlighted the role of cleric-politician Mian Abdul Haq, or Mian Mithu, accused of using his influence to facilitate conversions at his seminary in Ghotki. He was sanctioned by the UK in 2022.The report also cited cases where police were seen siding with abductors, often claiming it would be “haram” to return a girl after conversion.In July 2024, Faisalabad police recovered Christian minor Laiba Suhail, abducted in February and forcibly converted before being married off illegally. Another girl, Alina, is still missing. In January 2025, a Mirpurkhas court heard a plea from a couple accused of forcing an underage Hindu girl to convert and marry.Other cases were reported across provinces: in April 2025, 14-year-old a Hindu girl, Chahat disappeared in Quetta and later claimed in a video to have converted, though her parents produced documents proving she was underage.In May, Hindu Panchayats in Ghotki and Rohri protested the disappearance of a Meghwar teenager in Rohri, fearing abduction for forced conversion. In June, civil society groups and Hindu Panchayats in Larkana expressed concern over three minor girls and a teenage boy from Shahdadpur allegedly being forced to convert.The HRCP stressed that such cases continue to deepen insecurity among religious minorities and called for protective measures to safeguard vulnerable children and their families.The report listed multiple killings of Ahmadis: dentist Zakaur Rahman in Lalamusa (July 2024), Tayyab Ahmad in Rawalpindi (December 2024), Amir Hasan in Naukot (December 2024), Laeeq Cheema lynched in Karachi (April 2025), Muhammad Asif in Kasur (April 2025), and senior doctor Mahmood Sheikh in Sargodha (May 2025).The UN warned, “We are alarmed by ongoing reports of violence and discrimination against the Ahmadiyya community in Pakistan.”“According to the data provided by the Ahmadiyya community, 29 Ahmadi places of worship were attacked and damaged during the review period,” the report said.It further added that in 26 cases, the demolition was carried out by law enforcement agencies.“These incidents occurred in Okara, Khanewal, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Vehari, Sheikhupura, Gujrat, and Sargodha, among other locations Back in January, a historic Sialkot site linked to Pakistan’s first foreign minister Zafarullah Khan was “reduced to rubble”.The report said that the blasphemy law has been often misused to settle personal scores or seek financial gain in Pakistan, where, a ‘mere accusation of blasphemy can be a death sentence.’In September, last year, two men accused of blasphemy were killed while in police custody less than a week apart. One was inexplicably shot and killed in Mirpurkhas during an alleged police encounter, and the other was killed by a police constable inside a police station in Quetta.On 12 September 2024, constable Saad Khan Sarhadi shot dead Abdul Ali, a blasphemy suspect, inside Quetta’s Cantonment Police Station after mobs from religious parties gathered outside demanding his custody. It marked the first such incident in the city where a serving officer killed a suspect in custody. Days later, Ali’s family pardoned Sarhadi, while lawyers and a JUI-F senator pledged legal support for him.Later, on 17 September 2024, Shahnawaz Kunbhar, a civil hospital employee from Umerkot, fled to Karachi after a cleric accused him of posting blasphemous content. He denied the charge in a video message before being arrested by police, who assured his family of protection. Two days later, police claimed he was killed in an encounter, with officers celebrated as heroes.His family was prevented from burying him by armed mobs, and the body was desecrated. Following outrage from rights groups, a Sindh police inquiry declared the encounter “fake.”The report also showed that the mainstream media largely ignored issues of religious freedom under the period covered. Even the Islamabad High Court’s hearings into the “blasphemy business group,” affecting nearly 400 households and livestreamed for four months, drew little coverage. Likewise, cases of coerced marriages, forced conversions and violence against minorities rarely made headlines.A worrying trend has emerged in Pakistan, where ultra-right-wing groups are exerting growing pressure on the judiciary and elected officials through propaganda and intimidation, it added.","The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has raised alarm over violence against minority communities in the country.

’14 Pakistani Soldiers Killed’: Baloch Rebels Attack Day After India’s Strike On Terror Hubs | Watch





The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for an attack in Panjgur that left four Pakistan 's army personnel dead. According to BLA spokesperson Jeeyand Baloch, fighters launched a raid in the Surdu area of Panjgur on Tuesday night, eliminating a key operative of the Pakistan army.The statement revealed that Ghulam Sarwar had earlier established and commanded a so-called death squad under the protection of the Pakistani military. This squad, which had been active for years in Gichek and other parts of Panjgur, was later led by his son, Islam Sarwar. The group allegedly supported the army's operations, carrying out targeted killings, enforced disappearances, and other violent acts. In return, the army reportedly allowed them to freely engage in drug trafficking, kidnappings for ransom and extortion through road checkpoints.During the operation, BLA fighters seized three Kalashnikov rifles, an M-4, additional weapons, two vehicles, and three motorcycles from Islam Sarwar's hideout. The site, according to the BLA, also served as a torture chamber, where electric shock devices and other tools of abuse were found. Islam Sarwar was accused of abducting and killing a young man in Panjgur just two months earlier. Jeeyand Baloch warned that the Pakistani army and its allies would be held accountable for crimes against the Baloch people.The BLA's latest offensive is part of the ongoing insurgency in Balochistan , where separatist groups are demanding greater autonomy and recognition of Baloch rights. In recent years, attacks on military and paramilitary forces, along with government facilities, have intensified.Separatist factions argue that the Baloch people face systemic marginalisation and exploitation, despite the province's wealth in natural resources. In response, Pakistan's military has pursued counterinsurgency campaigns to suppress the rebellion. However, human rights groups have repeatedly raised concerns over reports of forced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, and excessive force during these operations.Numerous accounts point to the widespread issue of disappearances, with civilians and activists allegedly detained without due legal process. Rights organisations argue that such tactics fuel fear and deepen mistrust, further straining relations between the Pakistani state and the Baloch population.","Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for an attack in Panjgur that left four Pakistan's army personnel dead.

(AP

CHEMMANI: A baby bottle, a squeaky toy and a schoolbag are among items that have surfaced from a mass grave site in Sri Lanka's formerly war-torn northern region, along with 141 human skeletons including some that appear to be of children of different ages.The findings were made at a cremation ground in the Chemmani area near Jaffna town, the cultural heartland of the country's ethnic Tamil minority. But hardly any burials take place here, as Hindus mostly cremate their dead according to religious customs.Excavations have been underway since June, after workers found human remains while digging to build an electric crematorium.A pit test over nine days discovered 19 sets of human remains. Shallow burials of about 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) in a scattered and disorganized manner, and the absence of clothing, indicated the site was a mass grave, according to a report provided to a court in June.Since the area was secured and declared a crime scene that month, a total of 141 skeletons have been discovered within a 165-square-meter (1,776-square-foot) area. About 135 of the bodies had no clothing, and only one set of adult clothing was identified.Tests confirmed that a skeleton found with a schoolbag was that of a girl between 4 and 6 years old. Toddlers' dresses, socks and footwear, tiny bead bangles and a baby powder tray were also recovered.The identities of the dead and the cause and timing of their deaths are all unclear. But many think the victims could be civilians who disappeared during Sri Lanka's civil war, which broke out in 1983 between government forces and ethnic Tamil rebels, who fought to create an independent homeland for the minority group. The war ended in 2009.Several Tamil armed groups and an Indian peacekeeping mission were active in the region over the decades. But attention has focused on the Sri Lankan military, which had a heavy presence for over a decade in Chemmani, as the gateway to Jaffna town.Decades-old confession heightens suspicions A confession made by an army soldier before he was sentenced to death for rape and murder 27 years ago has strengthened suspicions about the site.In 1998, Somaratne Rajapakse along with four alleged accomplices from the military and police were sentenced to death for the gang rape and murder of a schoolgirl and the killing of her mother, brother and a neighbor.The five, who weren't hanged and remain in prison due to a moratorium on executions, have maintained that they were not involved in the rape and murder, but only disposed of the bodies under orders.Rajapakse told the court that he knew where up to 400 bodies were buried in Chammani.""We cannot say exactly who the perpetrators are yet, but the finger points to the (state) army,"" said Brito Fernando, an activist working with the families of people who disappeared during various armed conflicts in Sri Lanka.The area, including the cremation ground, were under Sri Lankan military control from 1996, when it captured Jaffna from the rebels, until after the war ended in 2009. The military operated checkpoints, and anyone who entered or left the area was searched.In 1999, Rajapakse led police to a spot where the schoolgirl, her family and the neighbor were buried and later showed police other places where more remains were found. But the investigations were abruptly stopped.Families want closure Items found at the site were publicly displayed earlier this month in the hope that their owners would be identified, and many people from surrounding villages and beyond visited the site.Amalanathan Mary Calista, whose husband has been missing since 1996 when the military arrested him in their village, said she hoped seeing proof that her husband was dead would bring a sense of closure.""I went there hoping to see at least his clothes. There was a sarong (clothing that wraps around the waist) but it wasn't my husband's. He was wearing a blue sarong at the time. It was disappointing,"" she said.""I only saw the clothing of little children,"" she added, as she wept.She said her husband is among 24 people who never returned home after the military searched their village. Families had tried to block the army vehicles from taking away the detained people, but the authorities pushed them aside with guns and the vehicles sped away, she said.""My wish is that he should be alive and return, but we can do nothing if it is not so,"" she said.""The state army arrested him. They must say that they arrested him and that he died at their hands. They also must pay us compensation,"" she said.Woman recalls military taking her brother and husband away Sivanathan Selvamalar said she watched her younger brother being loaded into a military truck blindfolded during that same raid. Years later, in 2009, her husband was also detained at a checkpoint. He called her to tell her of his arrest and was not heard from again.""We went to see the things, thinking they may have buried people who were arrested around this area, but we saw only the things of little children,"" she said.""We have checked all the prisons but have not found them. When we are told that more than 100 skeletons have been dug out, we fear the worst,"" she added.No children listed in missing person reports A 2003 report by Sri Lanka's Human Rights Commission said it investigated 281 complaints of missing persons from 1990 to 1998. Of these, three were found in prisons and later released, while the rest are still unaccounted for. The report said the military was responsible for 243 cases, while the Tamil Tiger rebels were responsible for 25. The responsibility for 10 others is unknown.No children were listed as missing.Nadesapillai Vithyatharan, the editor of the only newspaper in the region at the time, said several families returned to Jaffna after fleeing into rebel-held territory as the military moved in. Some reportedly went missing after being stopped at checkpoints set up to look for infiltrating rebels, he said.Calls for DNA analysis Although previous investigations stalled, there is hope now that victims will be identified, Fernando said. But he said the government must do more to conduct a credible investigation.""We don't have proper guidelines to investigate the mass graves and have no DNA bank to help with identification,"" said Fernando, adding that the government should fund a DNA bank and enlist international support in the identification of victims.""Only a proper investigation by the government can free its military from suspicion,"" he said.Any direct probe into the military would likely anger Sri Lankan nationalists. Many of the majority ethnic Sinhalese admire the military for winning the civil war.Excavations will continue for 8 more weeks Ground-penetrating radar in other parts of the cremation ground has shown ""soil anomalies ... that are indicative of comparable density of buried skeletal remains,"" according to a report submitted in the Jaffna court last week.The scanned area is three times larger than the site that has been excavated, said Ranitha Gnanarajah, a lawyer monitoring the process. Investigators have requested court approval to continue excavations for eight more weeks, she said.Army spokesman Brig. Waruna Gamage said no one has formally accused the army of responsibility for the mass grave, and if they did they would need to show proof, he said.""The excavations are still ongoing and it is a civil matter belonging to the police and courts,"" Gamage said. ""We will respect the law of the country.""Government forces and the rebels are both accused of committing atrocities amounting to war crimes in the months leading to the end of the civil war in 2009.","A baby bottle, a squeaky toy and a schoolbag are among items that have surfaced from a mass grave site in Sri Lanka's formerly war-torn northern region. The findings were made at a cremation ground in the Chemmani area near Jaffna town, the cultural heartland of the country's ethnic Tamil minority. Excavations have been underway since June, after workers found human remains while digging to build an electric crematorium.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123443103,imgsize-134550,width-400,resizemode-4/123443103.jpg"

At least 76 people were killed, including 17 children, in western Afghanistan after a bus carrying refugees collided with a truck and motorcycle and caught fire, according to provincial government spokesman Ahmadullah Muttaqi and local police.According to a news report from Al Jazeera, police said that the accident occurred due to the excessive speed and negligence of the bus. The bus route to Kabul was carrying refugees who were recently deported from Iran, according to provincial official Mohammad Yousuf Saeedi.They were part of a massive wave of Afghans who were deported from Iran recently.Earlier, Iranian minister of interior Eskandar Momeni announced that around 800,000 people would be deported by March.Saeedi said that all the passengers boarded the bus at a border crossing point, Islam Qala.Three passengers survived the accident after the bus collided with a motorcycle first and then hit the truck, which was carrying fuel. The collision was so strong that it led to the eruption of fire.Two people in the truck and another two on the motorcycle were among the deceased.","At least 76 people were killed, including 17 children, in western Afghanistan.

Braveheart 2.0: Why a Dundee girl became a right-wing symbol of resistance against immigrants in the UK,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/braveheart-2-0-why-a-dundee-girl-became-a-right-wing-symbol-of-resistance-against-immigrants-in-the-uk/articleshow/123545652.cms,"Why the video travelled



Age and shock: A school-age child holding a knife in public is intrinsically unsettling and newsworthy.

Public trust deficit: There is simmering scepticism about how effectively authorities protect women and girls, especially in working-class communities.

Narrative fit: The clip slotted into pre-existing debates about safety, policing, and who gets protected.

How politics entered the picture



The grooming-gang shadow



A cultural lens: Braveheart, not a blueprint



The law and the limits of self-defence



A familiar pattern of escalation



Why it matters



Institutional trust: The case exposes a wider confidence gap in policing and protection for vulnerable girls.

Immigration as lightning rod: Speculation about identity turned a local dispute into a migration debate.

Risk of unrest: Politicised narratives can spill over from online anger to street agitation.

The bottom line



Police Scotland said a 14-year-old girl was charged on 23 August after being found with a bladed weapon in St Ann Lane, Lochee, Dundee. A short video of the confrontation circulated online soon after, showing the teenager and her younger sister engaged in a dispute with an older man before the knife appeared. What might have remained a routine police matter became a national talking point once the clip went viral.Within hours, prominent right-wing commentators amplified the video, presenting the girl less as a suspect and more as evidence of state failure. Some online posts claimed the man in the footage spoke Arabic; from there, the incident was recast as a story about immigration and local safety. The shift was swift: a local altercation became a symbol in a national argument.Public reaction did not form in a vacuum. The UK is still marked by the grooming-gang scandals in towns like Rotherham and Rochdale, where authorities were accused of failing vulnerable girls. Those cases reshaped the political imagination: episodes involving young, working-class girls are now often read through that history of institutional failure. The Dundee video tapped into that reservoir of anger and mistrust.The Braveheart parallel is a metaphor, not reportage. The story of William Wallace—popularised by Mel Gibson’s film—endures as shorthand for Scottish defiance when leaders are seen to have failed. The Dundee clip resonated partly because it appeared, to some, like another tale of ordinary people forced to stand their ground. It’s an interpretive frame, not a claim about how people actually labelled the girl online.UK law prohibits minors from carrying knives. While self-defence is recognised, the force used must be “reasonable” in the circumstances; brandishing a blade in public rarely meets that bar. This creates a tension: many viewers read the scene as a child trying to protect herself, while the justice system treats it as a weapons offence involving a minor.Britain has seen local incidents amplified into national flashpoints before, particularly when incomplete details spread quickly online. That cycle—partial facts, rapid amplification, political reframing—risks hardening views before courts establish what happened.A child in a culture war: A 14-year-old has been pulled into a highly polarised argument she did not choose.A Saturday evening call-out in Dundee now sits at the intersection of crime, migration, and public trust. Whatever the courts decide, the political contest over what the video “means” is already underway. The Braveheart echo helps explain the emotional charge—but the facts, not the metaphors, must decide the outcome.","Police Scotland said a 14-year-old girl was charged on 23 August after being found with a bladed weapon in St Ann Lane, Lochee, Dundee.

‘Aided the rape epidemic of their own people’: Elon Musk renews attacks on UK officials over grooming gang scandal; pledges to fund legal action,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/aided-the-rape-epidemic-of-their-own-people-elon-musk-renews-attacks-on-uk-officials-over-grooming-gang-scandal-pledges-to-fund-legal-action/articleshow/123542975.cms,"File photo: Elon Musk (Picture credit: AP)

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has reignited controversy in Britain by calling for prosecutions of officials accused of failing to stop grooming gangs, following fresh claims that child sexual exploitation has taken place across dozens of local authorities.In a post on X, Musk wrote, “Start by condemning the grovelers and collaborators in positions of authority in Britain who aided the rape epidemic of their own people or turned a blind eye to their responsibilities. Both civil and criminal prosecutions.”His comment came in response to a user who shared the photo of a 14-year-old girl arrested in Dundee after allegedly carrying a bladed weapon, as reported by The Courier.The user had claimed teenage girls were resorting to defending themselves from rape, accusing police of failing to protect victims.Earlier, Musk replied to British MP Rupert Lowe, who chairs an unofficial “Rape Gang Inquiry.” Quoting Lowe’s findings, Musk posted: “85 cities in Britain where local authorities were complicit in the rape of children …”Lowe had announced that his inquiry uncovered evidence of gang-based sexual exploitation in 85 local authorities, describing it as “one of the most comprehensive exposés of the rape gang scandal to date.”He said the inquiry had received testimonies from survivors and families, alongside thousands of Freedom of Information requests.Musk has also pledged to fund legal action against “corrupt officials” accused of covering up abuse. In a separate post, he wrote: “I would like to help fund legal actions against corrupt officials who aided and abetted the rape of Britain, per the official government inquiry.”The billionaire later posted an image of the national flag of England, fuelling speculation about his intent to continue intervening in the debate.The issue of grooming gangs has gained renewed prominence since June, when Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer agreed to a government-backed national inquiry, reversing Labour’s earlier stance. Survivors and campaigners have since pressed the government to deliver on promises of justice.Lowe said his team’s research shows the problem stretches back to the 1960s and spans towns and cities across the UK. “The message from survivors is clear: get on with it. There have been too many broken promises,” he said, as cited by The Telegraph.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk has reignited controversy in Britain by calling for prosecutions of officials accused of failing to stop grooming gangs.

‘Sweating and babbling’: British Airways flight attendant found naked and high on drugs mid-flight; probe under way,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/sweating-and-babbling-british-airways-flight-attendant-found-naked-and-high-on-drugs-mid-flight-probe-under-way/articleshow/123483305.cms,"PTI file photo





A British Airways flight attendant was found naked and high on drugs in an onboard toilet during a flight from California to London. Described as “sweating” and “babbling,” he became agitated and was stood down by the flight’s manager after failing to assist with pre-flight safety checks.A subsequent blood test showed that Haden Pentecost, 41, had both methamphetamine and amphetamines in his system, reported the BBC.After complaining of stomach pain and saying he needed to change clothes, Pentecost locked himself inside a toilet. A colleague later discovered him there and, unaware of his state, before dressing him and moving him to an empty seat, the court heard.A health professional was called after the flight captain spoke to the flight attendant.Pentecost showed dilated pupils and an elevated heart rate, requiring checks every 20 minutes until the flight landed at Heathrow. Paramedics took him to the hospital, where a blood test was conducted.Witnesses described him as incoherent and erratic, muttering meaningless phrases. While reports suggest he had previously been investigated for unspecified conduct, this was his most serious breach yet, as cited by Aviation A2Z.He has since been dismissed by the Airways, and investigations are underway.He appeared at Uxbridge Magistrates’ Court on Friday and pleaded guilty to performing an aviation function while impaired by drugs. The attendant from Basingstoke was granted bail ahead of sentencing at Isleworth Crown Court at a later date.He was reportedly employed by the Airways in 2018.","British Airways flight attendant Haden Pentecost, 41, was found naked and high on drugs in an onboard toilet during a flight from California to London.
