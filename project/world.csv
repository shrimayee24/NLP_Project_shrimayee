‘Bhavan katham asti?’ Sanskrit finds new life in Assam’s border villages,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bhavan-katham-asti-sanskrit-finds-new-life-in-assams-border-villages/articleshow/115128731.cms,"Concentration levels of kids up since Sanskrit shift, say locals

GUWAHATI: ""Ek kilo parimitam alookam dadatu,"" requested Amalendu, a villager in Patiala Basti, asking for a kilogram of potatoes. Shopkeeper Akbar responded: ""Astu dadami (take it).""This exchange, a scene from daily life, is just one of many where Sanskrit has become an integral part of communication in Anipur Basti and Patiala Basti near the Bangladesh border in southern Assam's Karimganj - a Muslim-majority district where the official language is Assamese and the native tongue is Bengali.Here, the 5,000-year-old language is not just a subject in textbooks but a language spoken fluently in everyday life. Villagers greet each other with a friendly ""namaskaram"" while callers exchange, ""Bhavan katham asti (How are you)?"" to which the reply is, ""Samyak asmi (I am fine).""Patiala is also witnessing a revival, with at least 50 residents fluent in Sanskrit.Around 300 of the 400 residents of Anipur Basti converse comfortably in Sanskrit, conducting business and even personal calls in the ancient language.Suman Kumar Nath, a local school teacher and resident of Anipur, is proud of the village's linguistic journey. ""Being the oldest language of the country, Sanskrit is a very rich language and a reservoir of our ancient knowledge,"" he said.For Nath, Sanskrit is not only a way to honour heritage but a means of accessing the knowledge embedded in the language. Nath's school, which educates 200 children, including 20 Muslim students, teaches all students to converse in Sanskrit. From Classes 1 to 10, every child learns Sanskrit.The revival began about nine years ago, when villagers attended workshops and educational programmes aimed at reintegrating Sanskrit into daily life.The benefits of learning Sanskrit have been noticeable, particularly in education. Patiala Basti resident Dipan Nath said that adopting Sanskrit has positively impacted students' performance.""Since using the language, the concentration level of the students has increased, and they have performed well in academics,"" he explained.He attributed this to Sanskrit's extensive vocabulary, which allows villagers to answer questions concisely, often in a single word.The resurgence has drawn the attention of academics and language experts. Dr Sudeshna Bhattacharya, head of Sanskrit department at Gauhati University, visited Patiala Basti and was amazed by what she saw.""Though many tend to label Sanskrit a 'dead language', the villagers, including those without formal education, have been doing commendable work by using it in their life,"" she said.Bhattacharya recalled her visit to the village, where a woman without formal schooling welcomed her in fluent Sanskrit. ""It was a powerful moment,"" she said.","Sanskrit has become an integral part of communication in two villages in southern Assam. Around 300 of the 400 residents of Anipur Basti converse comfortably in Sanskrit. At least 50 residents of Patiala Basti are fluent in the 5,000-year-old language.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115128815,imgsize-1321232,width-400,resizemode-4/115128815.jpg"

This was Kumar’s first trip back to the forest since his father’s passing, as his friend Ahmed had been tending to his livestock while he was in mourning.The bodies were retrieved following a 12-hour search that concluded Friday evening. Late that night, the bodies were brought back to Ohli. Ahmed was buried in the local graveyard, while Kumar was cremated on the village outskirts.Locals, cutting across lines of caste and religion, united in paying respects and voiced their anger over the murders. “We want to tell Pakistan and their terrorists that we have lived together for years and will continue to do so. We will thwart their nefarious designs,” a villager said amid anti-terrorism and anti-Pakistan slogans .Ahmed, who leaves behind a wife, three sons, a daughter, and a physically disabled brother, was described as a pillar of his family. Kumar, who had lost his father only a week ago, is survived by his wife, two sons, and a daughter.“Shame on terrorists who cannot face our army and are shedding the blood of innocents,” a female relative of Ahmed said. “If they want to be good and want jihad, they should serve their parents dutifully — that is jihad.”A fellow VDG member emphasised the cowardice displayed in targeting unarmed civilians. “If the terrorists were brave enough, they should have given guns to the VDGs and had a fair fight, instead of blindfolding them with their hands tied behind and shooting them cowardly,” he said.The villagers demanded the authorities provide adequate ex gratia and govt jobs to the families of the slain VDGs, who had been the primary breadwinners for their households.They also demanded stronger counter-terrorism measures and called for additional VDG recruits to guard their mountainous forests of Kishtwar.A plea was also made for one VDG recruit from each of the 130 households in Ohli, which they said would offer better protection for their community.","Nazir Ahmed, 42, and Kuldeep Kumar, 40, were found bound, blindfolded, and shot from behind.

The accused Shailendra Rajput was arrested in Gujarat's Ankleshwar town Saturday.Police said Rajput - currently posted in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh - had incurred losses worth Rs 16 lakh in the stock market and taken a loan. He kidnapped the child and demanded a ransom of Rs 5 lakh to repay his debt. The boy, Shubham Rajpal, was the son of an industrial worker and often went to Rajput's house to play. On Thursday, Rajput abducted Shubham and put tape on the kid's mouth to stop him from screaming or raising an alarm, causing the child to faint. ""Rajput then put the boy in a metal trunk. As per preliminary investigation, the child must have died before 5pm,"" said DSP Ankleshwar Kushal Oza.Shubham's family reported him missing to police around 6pm the same day. Though Shubham had died, Rajput called the family the next morning (Nov 8) demanding ransom. Cops suspect that by making the call the day after the abduction, Rajput wanted to mislead investigators and delay the probe so that he would have time to dispose of the body. Rajput planned to dump the body in a field behind his house or leave it on the terrace. The idea of misdirecting the probe came from crime shows and movies, he told cops. Rajput had made the ransom call from a cell phone he had found on a train. He had used the same phone to call unknown women in the past months. Police traced one of these women, who said she didn't know the caller but he wore an armed forces uniform on a video call.""We then started checking for people in the neighbourhood serving in the armed forces. We identified the accused and upon checking his home, found the trunk in which the body was kept,"" DSP Oza said. Police officials found Shubham's body with the limbs bound and mouth taped.

Height of all children of Donald Trump

The surprising height of 18-year-old Barron Trump again became the internet's talking point after Donald Trump's return to the White House was smoothly sealed in a comfortable projected margin against vice president Kamala Harris.Barron Trump spent his childhood in the White House and the White House will again get to see a lot of 6'9'' Barron -- as this time he was his father's unofficial social media adviser. Barron is Trump's youngest son with Melania and is studying Business at New York University. Barron will not be a permanent resident of the White House as he will stay in New York for his college and Melania too is unlikely to shift her base to Washington from New York full time.All the Trumps are tall including Melania but Barron's height is shocking and he clearly dominates the room he's in. His father did not miss a chance to speak about his height every time he appeared on a podcast as he also mentioned how smart Barron is and how he knows a lot about the internet, cryptocurrency etc.Barron, the youngest of Donald Trump’s children, was born to Donald and Melania on March 20, 2006.

From China to Middle East: What Trump's return as US president could mean for allies and adversaries,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/from-china-to-middle-east-what-trumps-return-as-us-president-could-mean-for-allies-and-adversaries/articleshow/115052002.cms,"Photo/Agencies

Nato and Ukraine remain cautiously optimistic

European leaders' mixed response reveals underlying tensions

Middle East faces uncertainty

The China situation remains complex

Defying pollsters and election experts, Donald Trump is set to return to the White House as the 47th President of the United States of America. Trump emerged victorious against his rival and Democratic candidate Kamala Harris on Wednesday after surpassing the 270 electoral college votes required to win.The international community now watches anxiously to assess if Donald Trump's second stint as president would bring the same level of global instability that his allies anticipate.During his first term, Trump's approach strained relationships with many traditional US partners. His return to the White House carries significant implications across various domains, including worldwide commerce, environmental policies, and numerous international disputes and conflicts.Trump's agenda includes ramping up the tariff war with China, America's emerging economic and military competitor. Regarding the Middle East situation, he has made promises to resolve conflicts involving Israel, Hamas, and Hezbollah. Additionally, he has also committed to resolving the Russia-Ukraine conflict within his first few days in office, raising concerns among Ukraine's supporters about potential concessions favouring Russia.Nato Secretary-General Mark Rutte extended congratulations to Trump, saying, ""I look forward to working with him again to advance peace through strength through Nato"" amidst ""a growing number of challenges globally,"" including ""the increasing alignment of China, Russia, North Korea and Iran.""During his first term as the US president, Trump frequently criticised Nato, questioning other members' financial contributions. His recent statements suggested the USA might not protect Nato members failing to meet defence spending requirements. European officials worry about Trump's committment to Nato, despite his push for increased European military expenditure.Rutte maintained an optimistic stance, acknowledging Trump's previous success in encouraging member states to increase defence spending, noting Nato's enhanced position.European nations are currently assessing contingency plans should American defence support become uncertain.As Ukraine's primary military supporter against Russian aggression, the US relationship remains crucial. ""Do not try to predict Trump's actions. No one knows how he is going to act,"" a Ukrainian MP said.""He could ask Putin to freeze this war, and he says 'OK',"" a front-line soldier was quoted as saying by BBC. ""It's the worst scenario because in a couple of years, the Russians will advance again and might destroy us."" ""The second scenario is if Putin refuses,"" he said. ""There is a chance Trump will react radically. That is a more promising scenario.""Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy endorsed Trump's ""peace through strength"" approach.""This is exactly the principle that can practically bring just peace in Ukraine closer,"" Zelenskyy wrote on social media. ""I am hopeful that we will put it into action together. We look forward to an era of a strong United States of America under President Trump's decisive leadership.""Zelenskyy later said, ""I had spoken to Trump and congratulated him on ""his historic landslide victory—his tremendous campaign made this result possible. I praised his family and team for their great work. We agreed to maintain close dialogue and advance our cooperation.""Meanwhile, Moscow remained silent, with Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying that US-Russia relations were at their ""lowest point in history.""Leaders across Europe hastened to extend congratulations to Trump, even before official confirmation of his victory.The UK's Prime Minister Keir Starmer described it as a ""historic election victory"" and said that ""as the closest of allies, the U.K. and U.S. will continue to work together to protect our shared values of freedom and democracy."" Starmer's centre-left government has invested considerable effort in establishing connections with Trump and his associates, including a dinner meeting at Trump Tower in September.Emmanuel Macron of France offered measured congratulations with ""respect and ambition,"" whilst German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that ""surely many things will be different under a Donald Trump-led administration"" despite expressing desire for continued close relations.European officials stress upon the enduring nature of transatlantic relations beyond individual leadership, though concerns persist about Trump's protectionist economic policies, given his previous implementation of tariffs on European metals.During his first term as US President, Trump tried to establish diplomatic relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Currently, attention centres on how he will respond to the ongoing conflicts between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, as well as their primary supporter, Iran.Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised Trump's victory as ""history's greatest comeback.""""Your historic return to the White House offers a new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America. This is a huge victory!"" Netanyahu posted on social media.Despite their previously strong alliance as conservative nationalists, Trump and Netanyahu's relationship deteriorated when Netanyahu acknowledged Biden's 2020 victory. Whilst Netanyahu's close advisers hope for Trump's support against Israel's adversaries, Trump's decisions remain unpredictable. Additionally, Netanyahu faces domestic challenges, including recent nationwide protests following his unexpected dismissal of defence minister Yoav Gallant on Tuesday.Hamas released a brief statement indicating that their stance towards the new US administration would depend on its approach to Palestinian rights and interests.In a congratulatory note to Trump, Chinese President Xi Jinping emphasised the need for both nations to navigate their differences and establish harmony in a new phase of relations.According to Chinese state media, Xi told Trump that historical evidence shows mutual benefits from cooperation, whilst confrontation proves detrimental to both parties.However, Chinese experts remained sceptical, pointing to potential increases in trade tariffs and growing tensions regarding Taiwan. As president, Trump imposed tariffs on over $300 billion of Chinese imports. This time around he has said the tariffs could be in excess of 60%.""It is not all dark, but there are more challenges than opportunities,"" Da Wei, director of the Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University in Beijing was quoted as saying by news agency AP. ""We are clear about the challenges. As for opportunities, we are yet to see them clearly.""Ongoing territorial disputes in the South China Sea continue to strain US-China relations in Asia, likely requiring significant attention from the incoming American administration.Leaders across Asia, concerned about China's increasing influence and North Korea's nuclear capabilities, rushed to send congratulatory messages to Trump, seeking his engagement.","Donald Trump is set to return to the White House as the 47th President of the United States of America. The international community now watches anxiously to assess if Donald Trump's second stint as president would bring the same level of global instability that his allies anticipate.

Hindu temple there for 500 years: Trump’s prospective CIA chief Kash Patel’s pro-Ram Mandir take,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-cia-ram-mandir-kash-patel-hindu-modi/articleshow/115051231.cms,"Kash Patel’s Snap View

Trump's Personal Qualities:

One of the more intriguing aspects of this presidential race has been the plethora of Indian-Americans on both sides of the aisle, demonstrating that ABCD now stands for America-Born Confirmed Desis. While the Republicans have representation from Nikki Haley, Vivek Ramaswamy , and Usha Vance, Kamala Harris stands out on the Democrat side. The Biden Administration has also appointed numerous Indian-origin members, with Kash Patel emerging as the latest ABCD entrant, and Trump’s prospective pick for CIA chief.The Indian-origin American is considered the 'ultimate Trump loyalist' and previously played a key role in aiding Republicans’ efforts to discredit the Russia election interference probe. The former Republican House staffer has held senior positions within defence and intelligence during Trump’s prior administration.Several Trump allies have advocated for Patel’s appointment as the next CIA director. However, this role requires Senate confirmation—a process made easier after Republicans secured a majority on Tuesday. Should Senate approval not be forthcoming, Patel may be appointed as a member of the National Security Council.What makes Kash Patel’s views more compelling is his perspective on issues that markedly diverge from those of the US establishment and media. During the Ram Temple consecration, the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) expressed concerns, telling VOA they were “troubled” by the construction of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya. The New York Times described it as “A Triumph Toward a Hindu-First India,” and CNN reported, “Ayodhya Ram Mandir : India PM Modi inaugurates Hindu temple on razed Babri mosque site.” Patel accused Washington newspapers of only covering the past 50 years of history.He remarked to a leading daily in February: “To bring things really up to date, the opening of Ram’s Temple, when PM Modi went there, all the Washington newspapers only covered the last 50 years of history. They forgot the 500 preceding years. Whether or not you are Hindu or Muslim, there was a Hindu temple there for one of the quintessential gods in the Hindu pantheon in 1500 that was toppled, and they have been trying to get it back for 500 years.”He added: “But the Washington establishment forgot that part of history to put on what I believe is a disinformation campaign that’s harmful to India and the PM’s position. They’re using that because I think they liken Trump and Modi as similar figures, and the establishment class in Washington doesn’t want that to be the case.”In fact, Patel’s proposed ascendancy has an interesting side story. For those unfamiliar with Hindu mythology, a pivotal part in the Ramayana involves a squirrel. When Lord Rama’s army was building the bridge to Sri Lanka, a small squirrel, eager to help, began carrying tiny stones and dust to contribute. Lord Rama, noticing the squirrel's dedication, blessed it by stroking its back, leaving three white stripes as a symbol. In a recent twist, New York authorities caused outrage among MAGA supporters by euthanizing a pet squirrel named Peanut, and during Kamala Harris’s concession speech, a squirrel darted across the stage—sparking jests about divine intervention. On Diwali, Donald Trump condemned violence against Hindus in Bangladesh, pledging to protect Hindu-Americans from what he labelled the “radical left’s” anti-religion agenda. He highlighted his commitment to a “great partnership” with India and PM Modi, delivering a Diwali message aimed at a minority traditionally resistant to the Republican Party but showing increased openness to conservative support.Trump’s remarks resonated with concerns among Hindus about the neglect of Hindu minorities in Bangladesh. He also referenced California's contentious Senate Bill 403, intended to outlaw caste discrimination, which many Hindu-Americans see as unfairly targeting their community. Governor Gavin Newsom ultimately vetoed the bill, stating that existing laws sufficiently address caste discrimination, with rumours that VP Kamala Harris played a role to keep Hindu support within the Democratic Party. Trump’s praise for Modi, calling him both a friend and a “total killer” when necessary, aligns with his outreach to Hindu-Americans, contrasting with figures like US Ambassador Eric Garcetti, who has criticised India’s handling of recent diplomatic tensions with Canada.PM Narendra Modi was also one the first leaders who spoke to Trump after he won and the US President-elect called PM Modi a 'magnificent man' who was loved by 'the whole world'. Patel asserts Trump sees America as a global leader, not isolationist, with a commitment to securing American interests first and working closely with allies like India.Trump and Modi share mutual respect, Patel says, fostering a strong partnership focused on tackling shared threats, including terrorism and China’s regional influence.Patel claims Trump’s approach to China was more effective than Biden’s. Trump treated China as a serious threat, employing diplomatic, economic, and military measures to counter it and protect US interests.Patel describes Trump’s unpredictability as a strategic advantage, keeping adversaries off balance and deterring threats from countries like Iran and North Korea.Drawing from his immigrant background, Patel supports Trump’s strict stance on immigration, emphasising border security while maintaining lawful immigration to balance security and economic needs.Patel stresses the importance of US-India tech partnerships, especially in AI and quantum computing, which he views as crucial for national security. He criticises Biden for overlooking this partnership.Patel argues there’s a “two-tier justice system” biased against Trump and conservative views, alleging political agendas have overridden public service.Patel notes Trump’s emphasis on equitable contributions within NATO, asserting that allies should contribute fairly, a stance Patel claims challenged norms but promoted balanced alliances.Patel claims some US liberals’ criticism of Modi’s policies aims to create division, while Trump respects Modi’s governance, prioritising the broader US-India alliance over internal politics.Patel describes Trump as approachable and detail-oriented, suggesting his focus on personal connections has helped retain a loyal advisory team.",Kash Patel is considered the 'ultimate Trump loyalist' and previously played a key role in aiding Republicans’ efforts to discredit the Russia election interference probe.

America elected its first criminal president before electing its first female president.

That can’t be explained away. The Dems can’t give their usual excuses, with more ‘but, but, buts’ than a Kardashian family reunion.” he added.Trump has frequently voiced resentment about jokes aimed at him, and according to one account, wondering with aides whether satire can be punished. He has had a particularly contentious relationship with Jimmy Kimmel, calling him ""mediocre"" and a ""loser.""Kimmel in turn has taunted him possible prison time, in one instance reading out a message Trump sent him when he was hosting the Academy Awards, and joking, “Thank you, President Trump.

'Nostradamus' Allan Licthman blames democracy after failure to predict Trump win,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nostradamus-allan-licthman-blames-democracy-after-failure-to-predict-trump-win/articleshow/115058858.cms,"Lichtman’s Prediction Shock



The “Keys to the White House” Model: A Look Inside



Concerns Over Democracy



A System Under Strain: Evaluating the Keys



Reflections on a Missed Prediction and the Changing Political Landscape



The Fragility of Democracy in the 21st Century

American historian Allan Lichtman, often called the "" Nostradamus of US elections,"" found himself at a loss for words when his prediction of Kamala Harris ’ victory in the 2024 US Presidential Elections proved incorrect. Lichtman and his son Sam hosted a six-hour YouTube livestream, during which he was seen saying, “I don’t get it,” as Donald Trump moved closer to clinching victory.Visibly fatigued, stressed, and disappointed by the election outcome, Lichtman commented, “Good thing I have nothing to do tomorrow. And I’m not doing any interviews.” He added, “The democracy is gone.” In related coverage, the battle in Nevada, North Carolina, and Arizona remains “too close to call.”Reflecting on the state of democracy, Lichtman observed, “Once democracy is gone, it’s almost impossible to recover. The way to recover is by dictators losing wars.” On 6 November, Republican candidate and former president Donald Trump secured a historic victory, surpassing the required majority to defeat Kamala Harris. Trump celebrated the result as a “magnificent victory for the American people,” thanking his supporters.“This is the first moment of the night where I’ve lost hope a little bit,” Sam Lichtman admitted as news outlets announced that battleground Pennsylvania had gone to Trump.In a separate statement, Canada’s pro-Khalistani leader Jagmeet Singh shared his concerns following Trump’s win.Lichtman, expressing dismay, remarked that he hoped Trump would serve his term and that “we never have to deal with him again.” He further shared his disbelief, stating, “I just can’t wrap my mind around how that many people can just ignore all the stuff he did in 2020,” describing Trump as “too lazy to govern the country.”Concluding his livestream, Lichtman urged, “Democracy is precious, but like all precious things, it can be destroyed. And typically destroyed from within. Throughout the 21st century, democracy has been in decline around the world, and America has now fallen in step. But never give up hope. Never stop striving. Never stop trying, especially you young people.”For over four decades, Lichtman has used his ""Keys to the White House "" model with striking accuracy, having correctly predicted every presidential winner since 1984. The 77-year-old American University professor believed that Harris would emerge victorious in the 2024 election, convinced by the model's indicators that pointed towards a Democratic win. However, as the results confirmed Trump’s landslide victory, Lichtman found himself caught off-guard, live-streaming his disbelief alongside his son, Sam. The political soothsayer was left pondering what went awry, even joking, “Good thing I’ve nothing on tomorrow. No interviews for me.”Lichtman’s prediction model, the ""13 Keys to the White House,"" is based on a set of 13 true-or-false factors designed to assess whether conditions favour the incumbent party. If six or more of these keys turn “false,” the model suggests a loss for the incumbent. The keys range from economic performance and social stability to candidate charisma and major policy accomplishments. Lichtman believed that Kamala Harris had eight keys in her favour, with Trump falling short by several indicators. According to this analysis, Harris should have had a clear path to victory.In his forecast, Lichtman highlighted Harris’s advantages under keys like “No Primary Contest,” “Strong Long-term Economy,” and “No Foreign or Military Failures.” These indicators typically benefit the incumbent party when stable or positive. However, despite these favourable predictions, the electorate appeared to move in an unexpected direction, leading to Trump’s decisive win. This miss by the ""Keys"" model highlights potential limitations when applied to an increasingly unpredictable political landscape.As the election results unfolded, Lichtman’s initial disbelief soon gave way to deeper concerns for the future of democracy. At one point during the live broadcast, he lamented, “Oh, democracy’s gone,” capturing his fears of an era marked by fragility in democratic institutions. This sentiment went beyond his failed prediction and reflected a broader apprehension about the future of democratic governance, particularly given Trump’s polarising leadership style and its impact on political norms.Lichtman expressed that once democracy is eroded, its restoration is often an uphill struggle. He referenced historical precedents where authoritarian rule only ended through significant upheaval, such as wars or social revolutions. His son, Sam, attempted to lift his spirits, optimistically noting that they might not need to worry about Trump’s influence post-presidency. Lichtman, however, remained unconvinced, warning that “Democracy is precious, but like all precious things, it can be destroyed.” He emphasised that the erosion of democratic norms globally, particularly in the 21st century, has been an alarming trend.Since its inception, Lichtman’s model has been heralded as a robust alternative to traditional polling, which often misses nuanced voter sentiment. Developed after analysing patterns in presidential elections from 1860 to 1980, the ""Keys to the White House"" model was intended to cut through polling noise and highlight the broader conditions that typically sway elections. Its 13 true/false statements each support or oppose the incumbent's chances, with “true” answers favouring the incumbent party. Key factors include the presence of a strong economy, absence of major scandals, and whether the challenger lacks charisma.Here’s a quick overview of some of the critical keys that Lichtman relied on:Party Mandate – Incumbents often benefit if they hold a strong congressional majority after midterms.No Primary Contest – Indicates a unified front, favouring the incumbent.Strong Long-term Economy – If the economy shows sustained growth, it usually supports the incumbent.No Social Unrest – A stable social environment boosts the incumbent’s chances.No Scandal – Absence of scandals preserves public trust.Uncharismatic Challenger – This key favours the incumbent if the challenger lacks charisma.For 2024, Lichtman assessed that Harris held the advantage with eight keys, signalling a stable foundation for a Democratic win. However, the actual outcome suggests that the political and social undercurrents at play were more complex than the model could capture.With Trump’s victory now certain, Lichtman’s rare miscalculation may underscore how shifting political dynamics have impacted the reliability of traditional forecasting. Modern elections increasingly feature unexpected variables, including the growing influence of disinformation, polarisation, and the changing nature of voter loyalty. Lichtman’s model, while historically insightful, may face new challenges in accounting for the electorate’s evolving motivations.Furthermore, the 2024 election was notable for a heightened emotional atmosphere, with strong divisions across party lines. Trump’s polarising yet powerful rhetoric appealed to a substantial portion of the American electorate, particularly those disillusioned by the status quo. While Harris was backed by indicators that should have tipped the scales, voter sentiment appeared to lean towards a familiar figure promising change, albeit in a more controversial manner.For Lichtman, the 2024 result symbolises more than a missed prediction. His remarks about democracy’s precarious state reflect a larger worry: that American democracy, like many others worldwide, faces unprecedented strain. The increasing polarisation, erosion of institutional norms, and rise of populism have altered the landscape. Lichtman fears these factors could destabilise the democratic framework if they continue unchecked.The historian’s warnings echo broader anxieties about the potential consequences of leadership that disregards traditional democratic values.

The oldest person to be elected US President at 78, Donald Trump will have only four years in the White House thanks to the 22nd Amendment of the US Constitution that a President can only hold the office twice. Unless of course he decides to become a dictator for more than just one day, a desire he has expressed, seemingly in jest. On a more serious note, Trump has said win or lose he will not run for office again, which means he will cede the Oval Office in 2028 when he will be 82.Typical of the American political system, analysts are already eyeing potential successors in 2028, with all eyes on incoming vice-president JD Vance, who is only 40, and will become the highest-ranking member of the millennial generation in the US government. The challenge for Vance to step into Trump formidable shoes will not only come from other aspirants in the party, but also from Trump's own proclivity to entrust his children, including his daughter Ivanka, 43, and sons Donald Trump Jr, 46, and Eric Trump, 40, with political responsibility. Vance’s Indian-American wife, Usha Chilukuri, will now be the official Second Lady of the United States.Beyond family and political succession though, the most influential member of the Trump II inner circle is expected to be Elon Musk, the Tesla/SpaceX honcho who threw his mouth and moolah behind the MAGA Supremo to counter the liberal leanings of the legacy media. Already assured of a key role in the TrumpII administration, Musk -- was embedded with the MAGA Supremo in Mar-a-Lago as the results rolled in on Tuesday night -- will be a lodestar in an incoming dispensation that has pledged to cull government departments and expenditure in the name of efficiency. Although Musk posted a meme showing him bringing a kitchen sink into the Oval Office as Trump’s victory became imminent, he cannot run for President because he is not a US born citizen. But beyond the man behind the Resolute Desk, he is expected to be the most influential figure in the Trump II dispensation.With the MAGA Supremo’s disdain for the Washington elite now well-established (resulting in at least 40 members of his cabinet and inner circle being fired or forced to resign), there will be plenty of new faces in Trump II White House, including those who unquestioningly stood by him or kissed his ring after being defeated by him. Among them Vivek Ramaswamy, 39, the Indian-American bio-science entrepreneur who challenged Trump for the GOP nomination but folded quickly to become a camp follower. Two other Indian-Americans, Kash Patel and Shalli Kumar, stood rock solid behind Trump through all his trials and tribulations, and they will be looking for the spoils of office too.Former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the UN during Trump I, will also be looking to make a comeback after a late endorsement of Trump after critical comments about his campaign. Trump has also promised to let Robert Kennedy Jr, a man who has pushed crank science for decades, ""go wild"" with the health portfolio. Given that dozens of senior personnel in Trump I White House either resigned or were fired, there will be many new faces in Trump II, with everyone expected to toe the line in what will almost certainly be an imperial Presidency, a system endorsed by the US Supreme Court staffed by Trump during his first term.That will include the military commanders and the head of the US Federal Reserve and the Justice Department, who Trump expects to be pliable and follow the dictates of the White House. Having asserted that the President can do no wrong once – or anything he does is right since he has the mandate of the people once he is elected – Trump II is expected to be wild ride without guardrails.","Donald Trump will have only four years in the White House thanks to the 22nd Amendment of the US Constitution.

Susie Wiles, a veteran Republican strategist based in Florida, has managed several significant political campaigns . She led Trump’s Florida campaigns in both 2016 and 2020, and played a pivotal role in Ron DeSantis’ successful 2018 gubernatorial race.

based in Florida, has managed several significant . She led Trump’s Florida campaigns in both 2016 and 2020, and played a pivotal role in Ron DeSantis’ successful 2018 gubernatorial race. Wiles is the daughter of Pat Summerall, the renowned football player and sportscaster. Summerall played in the NFL for ten years and went on to announce 16 Super Bowls before his passing in 2013.

She worked alongside co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita, with orchestrating the most disciplined and sophisticated campaign of Trump’s three presidential runs.

Her previous successes also include steering Rick Scott’s 2010 campaign for Florida governor and a brief leadership role in Jon Huntsman’s 2012 presidential bid.

During the 1970s, she served in New York Representative Jack Kemp's Washington office. Subsequently, she took positions in Ronald Reagan's campaign and worked as a scheduler in his White House.

Later, she relocated to Florida, where she provided counsel to two Jacksonville mayors and worked alongside Representative Tillie Fowler.

Her career progressed into Florida's competitive political landscape, where she earned recognition for helping businessman Rick Scott secure the governorship.

Wiles earned widespread recognition both within and beyond Trump's close circle for orchestrating his most organised and effective campaign to date.

As the frontrunner for the position, she maintained a low profile, declining to speak during Trump's victory celebration in the early hours of Wednesday.

She strategically avoided the formal campaign manager title, considering Trump's previous history of making frequent changes in that role.

President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday appointed Susie Wiles , one of the two key campaign managers behind his election victory, as White House chief of staff . Wiles will make history as the first woman to serve in this role.This appointment marks the first in a series of expected staffing announcements as Trump prepares for his return to the White House on January 20.The US Vice President-elect JD Vance confirmed her selection. ""The 45th and 47th President of the United States of America Donald J. Trump announced today that Susan Summerall Wiles, the winning Campaign Manager for President Trump's highly successful 2024 Campaign for President, will be named President Trump's White House Chief of Staff,"" Vance wrote in a post on X.During the campaign, Wiles demonstrated exceptional ability in managing Trump's behaviour, achieving this through earned respect and demonstrating the benefits of following her guidance rather than disregarding it.""Susie is tough, smart, innovative, and is universally admired and respected. Susie will continue to work tirelessly to Make America Great Again,"" Trump said in a statement.""It is a well deserved honor to have Susie as the first-ever female Chief of Staff in United States history. I have no doubt that she will make our country proud,” he added.Trump's staff recognised Wiles' unique ability to work with his temperament and decision-making style whilst maintaining his authentic approach.During campaign events, Trump frequently acknowledged Wiles' contributions, highlighting what others had described to him as his ""best-run campaign.""""She's incredible. Incredible,"" he said at a Milwaukee rally earlier this month.Trump's first administration saw four chiefs of staff, including one serving in an acting capacity for a year, reflecting significant staff turnover. Several senior advisers were cast out in his first term, either due to Trump's resistance to management or because of ideological conflicts within the divided West Wing.This appointment represents Trump's initial significant decision as president-elect, potentially setting the tone for his incoming administration as he assembles the team to oversee federal government operations. Despite limited federal government experience, Wiles maintains a strong working relationship with the president-elect.The chief of staff position is ""absolutely critical to an effective White House,"" according to Chris Whipple, author of the book ""The Gatekeepers"", which examines how this role influences presidencies.""At the end of the day the most important thing is telling the president what he doesn't want to hear,” Whipple said.""On the plus side, she's shown that she can manage Trump, that she works with him and can sometimes tell him hard truths, and that's really important. On the minus side, she really has no White House experience and hasn't really worked in Washington in 40 years. And that's a real disadvantage,” he added.","Susie Wiles, a veteran Republican strategist based in Florida, has managed several significant political campaigns.

Although Harris won several Democratic strongholds, including Virginia and California, her campaign struggles to hold onto crucial votes, particularly in Black and Latino communities, where Trump's appeal has made inroads. Despite a loss of support in some demographics, Harris continues to focus on defending democracy, while Trump's campaign centers on issues like immigration and inflation.Trump's early success has also bolstered the Republican Party, which gained control of the Senate.

Judge allows Elon Musk’s $1 million-a-day sweepstakes amid accusations of election interference,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-presidential-elections/judge-allows-elon-musks-1-million-a-day-sweepstakes-amid-accusations-of-election-interference/articleshow/114961506.cms,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk at a rally

A Pennsylvania court has ruled that a high-profile $1 million-a-day sweepstakes, hosted by Elon Musk's America PAC in key swing states, can continue through the presidential election. The decision by Judge Angelo Foglietta on Monday comes after Musk’s lawyers argued that recipients of the sweepstakes are not chosen at random but rather selected based on alignment with the PAC’s values. Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, however, had attempted to halt the programme, describing it as a ""scam"" that breaches state election laws.The sweepstakes, designed to register over a million voters in battleground states, offers substantial payouts to selected participants who sign a petition supporting the First and Second Amendments. Musk’s lawyer, Chris Gober, defended the programme, explaining that recipients were not randomly picked but pre-screened to ensure they represent the PAC’s ideals. Gober confirmed that two more recipients would be named before Election Day, one in Arizona and another in Michigan.In response, Krasner’s legal team argued that the initiative is a thinly veiled attempt to sway the election. Testifying in court, America PAC director Chris Young admitted that recipients undergo personality assessments to determine if they fit the PAC's messaging and sign nondisclosure agreements to keep details of their selection process confidential. In past social media posts, however, Musk indicated that anyone signing the petition had a “chance” to win the daily $1 million prize, which Krasner's team pointed out contradicts claims that winners were not randomly selected.The sweepstakes also caught the attention of the US Justice Department, which recently issued a warning to Musk’s PAC over potential violations of federal election laws, specifically those that prohibit financial incentives tied to voter registration. This caution, reportedly sent by the department’s Public Integrity Section, has prompted America PAC to revise its messaging. Under new guidelines, recipients are now referred to as “spokespersons” rather than “winners,” a change some experts suggest does little to alter the sweepstakes' structure.Legal experts are divided on the issue. Some argue the programme exists in a legal “grey area,” potentially sidestepping direct violation of voter laws, while others contend it skirts dangerously close to illegal compensation for voter participation. Matthew Sanderson, a Republican election law expert, stated that while the programme raises legal questions, it does not necessarily break the law.The sweepstakes has already seen four winners from states like Pennsylvania and Michigan, all of whom publicly endorsed Trump and constitutional rights in promotional videos. America PAC has pledged that all prize funds will be disbursed by the end of November, although it remains unclear whether the recipients have received their winnings. Meanwhile, concerns linger over the PAC's potential long-term use of voter data from over a million registrants, which Krasner suggests may exploit participants beyond the election season.Elon Musk, who did not attend the court hearing, has already poured more than $70 million into the PAC, backing Trump’s campaign and other Republican candidates ahead of the election. Krasner hinted he may pursue civil damages for Pennsylvania residents who signed up for the sweepstakes, suggesting that Musk's operation misuses electoral integrity and infringes on the state’s lottery laws.","A Pennsylvania court has ruled that a high-profile $1 million-a-day sweepstakes, hosted by Elon Musk's America PAC, can continue through the presidential election. Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner had attempted to halt the programme, describing it as a ""scam"" that breaches state election laws. The sweepstakes offers substantial payouts to selected participants who sign a petition supporting the First and Second Amendments.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114961487,imgsize-16066,width-400,resizemode-4/114961487.jpg"

Climbing Florida's political ladder



A Pragmatic approach to Trump’s leadership style



Challenges ahead in West Wing



US President-elect Donald Trump in a historic move appointed Susie Wiles as the first woman to serve as White House chief of staff. A veteran political strategist and key figure in Trump’s 2024 campaign, Wiles is widely known for her strategic expertise and her ability to navigate the complexities of Trump's political style.The selection was confirmed by Vice President-elect JD Vance , who described her as “the winning Campaign Manager for President Trump’s highly successful 2024 Campaign for President.”Wiles has deep roots in Republican politics, particularly in Florida, where she managed multiple successful campaigns. Known for steering Trump’s Florida efforts in both 2016 and 2020, she also contributed to the 2018 gubernatorial campaign of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis . Her political career began in the 1970s in Washington, working in the office of New York Representative Jack Kemp, followed by roles in Ronald Reagan’s campaign and administration. She later transitioned to Florida politics, where she helped Rick Scott secure the governorship in 2010.Trump praised her as “tough, smart, innovative, and universally admired,” adding, “It is a well-deserved honor to have Susie as the first-ever female Chief of Staff in United States history. I have no doubt that she will make our country proud.”Wiles’ success with Trump lies in her ability to balance his temperament while maintaining a disciplined campaign structure. She worked alongside co-manager Chris LaCivita to lead a more organised campaign than Trump’s previous runs. Known for her low-profile approach, Wiles avoided the spotlight, even refraining from speaking at Trump’s victory event.Her role as chief of staff will involve coordinating the president-elect’s agenda, managing personnel, and acting as a close advisor. “At the end of the day the most important thing is telling the president what he doesn't want to hear,” said Chris Whipple, author of The Gatekeepers. Whipple acknowledged her skill but noted her limited Washington experience as a possible disadvantage.Daughter of NFL legend Pat Summerall, launched her political career in Washington before establishing herself as a formidable strategist in Florida's high-stakes political landscape. She played a pivotal role in Rick Scott's successful 2010 gubernatorial bid and briefly worked on Jon Huntsman's 2012 presidential campaign.However, her relationship with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis grew tense, ultimately leading to a split. This division escalated during the 2024 primaries, where she led Donald Trump’s campaign against DeSantis.Wiles’ influence within Trump’s team reportedly fueled the campaign’s strategy, often using insider knowledge from her past work with DeSantis. After DeSantis suspended his presidential bid, Wiles posted a succinct farewell on social media: “Bye, bye.”Throughout the campaign, Trump’s aides, emboldened by Wiles’ insights, seized opportunities to mock DeSantis, targeting everything from his mannerisms to his footwear.Wiles’ pragmatic approach earned her Trump’s respect, allowing her to guide him without lecturing or reprimanding. During a widely criticised speech in Pennsylvania, Wiles reportedly managed to communicate disapproval by standing nearby and staring in silence depicting her unique approach to managing Trump’s behaviour. Trump has publicly acknowledged her contributions, describing her leadership as “incredible” and calling her campaign management his “best-run campaign.”Wiles’ appointment signals a potential shift from Trump’s first term, where he experienced high turnover in the chief of staff role. Trump has remarked that he feels more prepared for his second term, having learned from past personnel decisions. While Wiles’ ability to balance discipline and Trump’s dynamic style has been effective, only time will tell if her role will bring more stability to the administration as she steps into one of the most demanding jobs in Washington.","US President-elect Donald Trump appoints Susie Wiles as White House chief of staff.

Republicans secure control of Senate

Trump assembles new administration

Donald Trump has emerged victorious in Arizona, flipping the state back into the Republican column after it was narrowly won by Joe Biden in 2020. This decisive win in the crucial battleground state, which carries 11 electoral votes, has propelled Trump’s Electoral College total to 312, compared to Vice President Kamala Harris' 226. Arizona, historically a key swing state, had been seen as a stronghold for Democrats in recent years.The win in Arizona also marks Trump’s success in all seven battleground states, including Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and North Carolina, all of which he had lost in 2020. This sweeping reversal of fortunes reflects his continued strong appeal among conservative and working-class voters, including a substantial share of Hispanic voters in states like Arizona.In addition to securing the presidency, Republicans have reclaimed control of the Senate, winning 52 seats to the Democrats' 47, with strong performances in key states. The House of Representatives is also expected to remain under Republican control, with CNN reporting GOP victories in 213 seats, close to the 218 needed for a majority. NBC currently projects Republicans at 212 seats, with Democrats holding 204, though senior Democrats still hope for a narrow win to counterbalance Trump's legislative power.Democrats, meanwhile, are internally questioning the decision to replace Biden with Harris at the top of the ticket only 100 days before the election, with some, like former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, suggesting an earlier withdrawal by Biden could have opened the field for stronger candidates.With victory secured, Trump is already preparing for his second term. Susie Wiles, his campaign manager, has been named White House Chief of Staff, marking a historic first for a woman in the role. Trump has ruled out appointing Mike Pompeo and Nikki Haley to Cabinet roles, instead favouring new faces like former ambassador to Germany Ric Grenell for secretary of state, and Florida Senator Marco Rubio. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., known for his anti-vaccine stance, is also expected to play a prominent role in health policy, with Elon Musk being considered for a role in government auditing.","Donald Trump has won Arizona, flipping the state back into the Republican column.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a law ratifying a strategic partnership treaty with North Korea, which includes a mutual defence agreement. The decree, published on Saturday, follows the summit between Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang this June. The treaty, which has now passed through Russia's parliamentary process, promises that both countries will provide military assistance to each other in the event of an armed attack.The treaty’s ratification strengthens the relationship between Moscow and Pyongyang, particularly since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Reports from both South Korea and Western intelligence suggest that North Korea has already supplied Russia with arms, with Ukrainian investigators claiming to have found evidence of North Korean weaponry at sites hit by Russian forces.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has confirmed reports that North Korean soldiers have been deployed to Russia, with around 11,000 troops reportedly sent to the southern Kursk region. These troops have allegedly been involved in combat with Ukrainian forces, though Russia has not publicly acknowledged their presence. South Korea’s Ministry of Defence has similarly stated that approximately 10,000 North Korean soldiers are now stationed in Russia, some of whom have been deployed to frontline areas.The treaty, which was ratified by both houses of the Russian parliament, pledges that if either country is attacked, the other will provide all necessary military and other assistance, in line with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, which permits collective self-defence.Meanwhile, the Ukrainian military faces increasing challenges as Russian forces advance in key areas, particularly around the Donetsk region, where they have captured multiple villages. Ukrainian commanders have warned that North Korean troops may soon join Russian forces in the ongoing offensive.The United States has expressed concern over the growing military cooperation between Russia and North Korea, with US secretary of state Antony Blinken confirming the deployment of North Korean soldiers to Russian battlefields.

A serious incident on GT Road near Kalashah Kako saw nine people injured when a van collided with a stationary truck, its driver unable to see the parked vehicle through the dense haze.The smog has also forced Lahore high court to mandate a shutdown of all trade activities by 8 pm and close markets on Sundays, aiming to minimize pollution-inducing activity.In Multan, conditions reached what experts called ""apocalyptic"" levels, with the AQI exceeding 2,000 on Friday morning. The concentration of PM2.5—a hazardous particulate matter known to cause severe respiratory and cardiovascular issues—was recorded at 947 micrograms per cubic meter, nearly 190 times above World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines.
