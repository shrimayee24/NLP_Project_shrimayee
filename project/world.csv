Zelenskyy proposes summit in India to push plan to end Russia-Ukraine war,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ukraine-floats-india-summit-to-push-plan-to-end-russias-war/articleshow/112930579.cms,"Swiss summit falls short



Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiyy has proposed holding a summit in India aimed at ending the war with Russia , according to people familiar with the matter.The proposal was put to PM Narendra Modi during his visit to Ukraine last week, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private talks.Zelenskiyy aims to hold a second leaders meeting before the US presidential election in November as a follow-up to a summit in June, which sought to win support from nations of the Global South for Kyiv in its 2 1/2 year war with Russia.A gathering in India, which has been wary of the Ukrainian initiative because it so far excludes Russia, would be viewed as progress in Kyiv. PM Modi, who during his Aug. 23 visit signaled his backing for Ukrainian sovereignty within its internationally recognized borders, has yet to agree to host a meeting, the people said.PM Modi has signaled his willingness to play a “constructive role” in a peace process, though it’s “too early to comment on specific modalities and pathways at this stage,” Randhir Jaiswal, a spokesman for ministry of external affairs said in response to a query.The diplomatic effort has taken on new urgency as Russian forces gain ground in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region and Ukraine’s military made a surprise incursion into Russia’s Kursk region this month. With both sides on the offensive, adiplomatic resolution to the full-blown conflict that began with Russia’s invasion in February 2022 remains a distant prospect.A Zelenskiyy spokesman, Serhiy Nykyforov, said Ukraine is weighing holding the follow-up summit in a country of the Global South, including India “in particular.”Zelenskiyy seeks to win broader global support for his 10-point peace blueprint, including a demand to withdraw all Russian forces from Ukrainian territory, and isolate Russia before beginning direct talks. But nations of the Global South have demanded that any forum that pushes for peace can only gain traction if Moscow has a seat at the table.Ukraine has expressed openness to including Russia in the process, though the Kremlin has repeatedly made clear it has no intention of engaging with Kyiv’s blueprint.The June 15-16 summit hosted by Switzerland, which drew more than 100 countries and organizations, fell short in its ambition to cement global support. China didn’t attend, while India joined delegations including Indonesia and South Africa in declining to sign the final communique.Zelenskiyy raised the issue during Modi’s visit, seeking India’s signature, the president’s spokesman, Nykyforov, said, adding that the host of a second summit must have signed the text. The language in that document had already been narrowed to focus on specific issues — nuclear and food safety and the return of abducted children and prisoners — to win over maximum support.But India’s skepticism of Ukraine’s initiative is due to Russia’s exclusion, according to senior Indian officials familiar with the diplomatic exchanges who spoke on condition of anonymity. Modi’s government has made clear that a solution can only be found through dialog between the two sides, they said.Modi followed through with that message during his visit to Kyiv last week — the first by an Indian premier since Ukraine’s independence in 1991. Even as he offered his most direct support for the country’s territorial integrity, he stood by his call for a diplomatic resolution as the only path to peace.As the West has expressed outrage over Russia’s attack on its neighbor, India has maintained political and economic links with Moscow, which supplies India with cheap oil and weapons. PM Modi’s Kyiv visit followed a trip to Moscow last month for talks with President Vladimir Putin.That trip drew criticism from US and Ukrainian officials, particularly because it occurred on the same day that a deadly Russian missile strike hit a children’s hospital in Kyiv. But Modi informed Zelenskiyy this month that he had spoken to Putin — “looking him in the eye” — and told him that “this is not the era for war.”“I spoke my mind clearly that the solution to any problem cannot be found on the battlefield,” Modi said in Kyiv. He spoke with both US President Joe Biden and Putin about the war in Ukraine following his visit to Kyiv.The prospect for a summit that would involve Russia has also grown uncertain in the wake of the Kursk incursion. It was followed on Monday by Russia’s biggest aerial attack on Ukraine since the invasion began and targeted the country’s power infrastructure.Zelenskiyy said earlier this week that the move into the Kursk was part of a “victory plan” to force Moscow to end the war that he will present to Biden and the contenders for US presidency next month.At the same time, his army chief Oleksandr Syrskyi admitted the attack has so far failed to blunt Russia’s push in the east, which increasingly threatens the city of Pokrovsk, the key military logistics hub for Kyiv’s military operations in the east.Moscow’s military commanders had no plan to send significant forces from Ukraine to the Kursk region, a person close to the Kremlin told Bloomberg last week.Russian military bloggers have claimed that Ukraine’s defenses in the region around Pokrovsk have gradually weakened. At the same time, some have worried that Kyiv may be holding forces back in order to launch counter attacks further south in the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions.",Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiyy has proposed holding a summit in India.

Indira's assassination

Who is Jagdish Tytler

Background of the case:

Forty years after the bloody anti-Sikh riots , Delhi court on Friday directed the Central Bureau of Investigation ( CBI ) to frame charges against Congress leader Jagdish Tytler in the case that resulted in death of three persons in the 1984 massacre.Special CBI judge Rakesh Siyal said there was sufficient evidence against Tytler, a former union minister, to put him on trial.""Sufficient ground is there to proceed against the accused person,"" the judge said.The charges against Tytler and others have been filed under sections 147 (rioting), 109 (abetment of an offence) read with 302 ( murder ) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).Operation Blue Star was a significant event in the history of India that took place in June 1984. It refers to the military operation ordered by the Indian government to remove Sikh militants, headed by Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, who had fortified themselves inside the Golden Temple complex in Amritsar, Punjab.The operation and the subsequent events caused a deep sense of mistrust and alienation among the Sikh community towards the Indira government. The Indian National Congress, which was seen as responsible for the military operation, faced significant backlash from Sikhs, which impacted the party's political fortunes in Punjab and other regions with a significant Sikh population.The fallout from Operation Blue Star resulted in a tragic event that altered the course of Indian history. PM Indira Gandhi was on her way to meet British actor Peter Ustinov for a documentary. Ustinov was going to interview her. As she walked through the garden of PM residence at 1 Safdarjung Road, her trusted bodyguards, Beant Singh and Satwant Singh opened fired on Indira and she fell on the ground.She was rushed to the hospital and died hours later. Beant Singh was shot dead another guard Satwant Singh and conspirator Kehr Singh was sentenced to death.Indira's assassination triggered anti-Sikh riots in Delhi and other parts of the country, leading to widespread violence, loss of life, and damage to Sikh properties.During the riots, one of the names that cropped up was of Congress leader Jagdish Tytler, who was accused of leading a mob that killed three people in the Pul Bangash area in the capital.Jagdish Tytler, born on August 17, 1944, in Gujranwala, a city now located in Pakistan, is the son of James Douglas Tytler, who established several renowned educational institutions, including the Delhi Public School, the Summerfields School and the JD Tytler Higher Secondary School.Throughout his career, Tytler has represented India on various international platforms. He served as a one-man delegation to the United Nations Conference on alternative energy sources held in Yugoslavia and led the Indian delegation to the United Nations on multiple occasions.Tytler's political career began under the leadership of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1985, during whose tenure he held several ministerial positions, including Minister of Civil Aviation, Minister for Surface Transport, Minister for Tourism, Minister for Labour, and Minister for Food Processing.He also served as the Minister for Coal during the government led by PV Narasimha Rao.As an MP, Tytler represented the Delhi Sadar Parliamentary Constituency from 1980 to 1989 and again from 1991 to 1995.He also held the position of Minister of State for Overseas Indian Affairs (Independent Charge) and chaired the Committee for Environment and Science & Technology within the All India Congress Committee.On June 2, 2023, a Delhi court approved a supplementary chargesheet filed by CBI against Tytler in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots case.In April 2023, Tytler had appeared before the CBI and given samples of his voice in connection with the case for the Central Forensic Science Laboratory to examine.In May 2023, the CBI filed a chargesheet against Tytler in a case related to the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, alleging that he instigated the mob to attack a gurdwara in Delhi in which three Sikhs were burnt alive.",Jagdish Tytler is accused of instigating a mob to attack a gurdwara in Delhi in 1984. The mob killed three people in the Pul Bangash area in the capital. The charges were filed under sections 147 (rioting) and 109 (abetment of an offence) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC),"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112933013,imgsize-568847,width-400,resizemode-4/112933013.jpg"

Today our MLAs decided that we come to the Assembly for work, so we don't want a 2-hour break. There are members from the minority community in our Assembly rules committee, so everyone has taken this decision. This is not my decision, it is the Assembly's decision,"" he said.Earlier in the day, the Assam CM said that the state assembly had decided to abolish Jumma break in an attempt to remove ""colonial burden"" from the state.""In order to increase the productivity of the Assam Legislative Assembly and to remove the colonial burden from the state, the rule of adjourning the House for 2 hours every Friday for Jumme was abolished.

The incident occurred on Monday as Mes was defending Ukrainian airspace, one of the few pilots trained to operate the advanced jets recently supplied by NATO allies .Mes, a member of Ukraine’s elite group of combat pilots, was piloting one of the first F-16s delivered to Ukraine, a symbol of Western support in the ongoing conflict. The aircraft had successfully intercepted several Russian cruise missiles before disaster struck.According to Ukraine's military, communication with Mes's jet was suddenly lost amid the fierce battle. The wreckage was later discovered, confirming the worst: Mes had given his life in defense of his country.Ukraine's military has opened an investigation into the crash, with early reports suggesting that pilot error or mechanical failure may have been the cause, rather than enemy fire, according to the report by NYT.Mes had been part of Ukraine's air force since the early days of the conflict. His death has sent shockwaves through the country, with many seeing it as a significant blow to both the military and national morale.The F-16s, which arrived in Ukraine just weeks ago, were seen as a crucial component in the country’s defense strategy, and Mes was among the first to be trained to fly them.The crash occurred during what President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described as one of the largest Russian attacks since the invasion began.Over 200 missiles and drones were fired at Ukrainian targets, and Mes, along with his fellow pilots, was at the forefront of the defense effort. Despite the intense barrage, the F-16s had ""demonstrated their high efficiency,"" according to Ukraine’s general staff, shooting down multiple threats. But as the battle raged on, Mes’s jet went down.On Thursday, a large funeral was held in Lutsk, a city in northwestern Ukraine, where Mes was laid to rest with full military honors. The skies above the city were filled with the roar of Ukrainian air force jets performing a flyover in tribute to their fallen comrade. The funeral was attended by family, friends, fellow pilots, and citizens, all united in grief and admiration for a man who gave everything in defense of his homeland.""Oleksiy saved Ukrainians from deadly Russian missiles. Unfortunately, at the cost of his own life,"" read a poignant post from the air force's western command on social media. The post captured the deep sorrow felt across the country, as well as the profound respect for Mes’s sacrifice.The pilot’s death comes at a critical time for Ukraine, as the country faces relentless pressure from Russian forces in the east. Mes’s passing is a stark reminder of the human cost of the war and the high stakes involved as Ukraine continues its fight for survival. While the F-16s represent hope for a stronger defense, the loss of a pilot like Oleksiy Mes underscores the ongoing peril and the sacrifices being made on the front lines.As the nation mourns, Mes’s legacy as a fearless pilot and a symbol of Ukraine's resilience will continue to inspire those who carry on the fight. His name now joins the ranks of those who have given their lives in the struggle for Ukraine's freedom, a reminder of the personal sacrifices behind the headlines of this devastating conflict.","Oleksiy Mes, a member of Ukraine's elite combat pilots, was killed when his F-16 fighter jet crashed during a massive Russian missile assault.

He had said, ""I'm going to be voting that we need more than six weeks,"" but his campaign quickly worked to correct the narrative, asserting that his comments did not reflect his actual voting intention.The backlash from social conservatives was swift. Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, expressed strong disapproval, stating, ""We strongly support Florida’s current heartbeat law... For anyone who believes in drawing a different line, they still must vote against Amendment 4, unless they don’t want a line at all.""Trump's evolving position on abortion underscores the political challenges he faces, given his role in appointing three Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn Roe v.

She reiterated her belief that ""the government should never come between a woman and her doctor.""In response to the controversy, Trump has recently made efforts to present himself as supportive of reproductive rights.

""Five were wounded in the operation, while two others were hurt in falls,"" a US military official was quoted as saying by the news agency AP.The casualties from this operation were higher than those in other raids conducted since the militants were driven out of their self-proclaimed caliphate across Iraq and Syria.Central command claimed that the IS militants were armed with ""numerous weapons, grenades, and explosive 'suicide' belts"" during the attack, which took place in the Anbar desert.The operation aimed to disrupt and degrade the Islamic State group's ability to plan, organize, and conduct attacks against Iraqi civilians, US citizens, allies, and partners throughout the region and beyond.

As a result of the coalition's efforts, the Islamic State lost control of its territories in Iraq in 2017 and Syria in 2019.Despite these setbacks, the militants have persisted in operating within the Anbar Desert, situated between Iraq and Syria, while also claiming responsibility for attacks perpetrated by others in various parts of the world.","US military participated in a raid in western Iraq that resulted in the deaths of 15 IS operatives. 7 US troops were also injured in the joint operation.

The United States experts are aiding in the investigation of the crash, which marked the first reported loss of an F-16 in Ukraine.The dismissal order for Lt General Mykola Oleshchuk was published on the presidential website.Zelenskyy immediately addressed the country, stressing the need to protect personnel and strengthen the army at the command level. Shortly after, Lt General Anatolii Kryvonozhko was appointed as the acting air force commander by the Ukrainian army’s general staff.""We need to protect people. Protect personnel. Take care of all our soldiers,"" said Zelenskyy in his address following the publication of the order.The dismissal coincided with intense criticism directed at a deputy head of the Ukrainian parliament's defense committee, lawmaker Mariana Bezuhla, who claimed the F-16 was downed by a patriot air-defense system during its operation.Bezuhla’s claim, based on unnamed sources, demanded accountability for what she described as an error.In response, Oleshchuk accused Bezuhla of defaming the air force and discrediting US arms manufacturers. He expressed his hopes that she would face legal consequences for her claims.""The truth will win,"" Bezuhla posted on X shortly after the dismissal order was made public.Oleshchuk did not deny the possibility that the F-16 was hit by a Patriot missile. The air force confirmed that US experts have joined the Ukrainian investigation into the crash.While internal disputes unfolded, a Russian attack using powerful plane-launched glide bombs struck the northeastern city of Kharkiv, resulting in six fatalities, including a 14-year-old girl on a playground, and 47 injuries.Regional governor Oleh Syniehubov reported that the bombs hit five locations across the city, which previously had a population of 1.4 million people. One of the bombs blasted a 12-story apartment block, trapping at least one person on an upper floor and raising fears of a structural collapse as emergency crews searched for survivors.In retaliation, Ukrainian rockets struck the Russian city of Belgorod and its surroundings late on Friday, killing five and injuring 37, according to Belgorod regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov. The region, which borders northern Ukraine, experiences frequent drone and artillery attacks.Zelenskyy cited the Kharkiv strikes as further evidence in urging Western partners to lift restrictions on what the Ukrainian military can target with donated weapons.The Kharkiv strike ""wouldn't have happened if our defense forces had the capability to destroy Russian military aviation at its bases. We need strong decisions from our partners to stop this terror,"" Zelenskyy said.F-16 warplanes, which Ukraine began receiving from European countries at the end of the previous month, are among the weapons that could be used to target Russian bases behind front lines. However, analysing the crash is ongoing, as announced by Oleshchuk on Telegram prior to his dismissal.""We must carefully understand what happened, what the circumstances are, and whose responsibility it is,"" Oleshchuk wrote shortly before his dismissal.The crash represented the first reported loss of an F-16 in Ukraine’s conflict, where at least six such jets are now believed to have been delivered. Military experts have voiced that the introduction of F-16s might not be a game-changer in the war against Russia, given Moscow's substantial air force and sophisticated air-defense systems.However, Ukrainian officials valued the addition of the supersonic jets, which are equipped with modern weapons, as an opportunity to challenge Russia's air superiority.On the battlefield, Russian forces continue their gradual advance into eastern Ukraine, while Ukrainian troops are holding positions in the Kursk border region of western Russia following a recent incursion.The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, predicted losses of Western-provided military equipment for Ukraine during combat but emphasised the major impact of any F-16 losses on Ukraine's air defense capabilities.In further developments, European Union defense ministers agreed to enhance their training program for Ukrainian troops. The target was raised to 75,000 with an additional 15,000 recruits expected by the year’s end, confirmed EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell.The announcement was made after a ministers' meeting in Brussels.""Today the ministers agreed to raising the target to 75,000, adding 15,000 more by the end of the year,"" Borrell told reporters post-meeting.""The training has to be shortened and adapted to the Ukrainian training needs,"" Borrell added. He noted that the EU would establish a small ""coordination and liaison cell"" in Kyiv to enhance the effectiveness of the training program.To date, 60,000 troops have completed the bloc's training scheme, which is conducted outside Ukraine.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy dismissed, Lt General Mykola Oleshchuk.

"Is US ready to accept the 2024 election outcome? Most Americans say yes, but poll shows Trump’s supporters have doubts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/is-us-ready-to-accept-the-2024-election-outcome-most-americans-say-yes-but-poll-shows-trumps-supporters-have-doubts/articleshow/112939073.cms,"Poll findings

Confidence in election integrity

Partisan and ideological divides

Methodology

As the 2024 presidential election approaches, a significant majority of Americans express readiness to accept the election results, though divisions persist, particularly regarding former President Donald Trump.According to the poll conducted by ABC News/Ipsos from August 23-27, 81% of Americans say they are prepared to accept the election results regardless of the outcome.In comparison, 68% believe Kamala Harris will accept the results, while only 29% feel the same about Trump.Support for accepting the election results varies significantly by political affiliation. Nearly all of Harris' supporters (92%) are ready to accept the outcome, contrasted with 76% of Trump's supporters. Additionally, 21% of Trump's backers—translating to about 8% of all adults — are unwilling to accept the election results.Confidence in the accuracy of the election count is also split. One-third of Americans (34%) express doubts about whether votes will be counted accurately, a figure unchanged since 2022. About 65% are confident in the vote count, with only 32% being very confident.This skepticism extends to beliefs about the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election. Thirty-four percent of Americans think Joe Biden did not win legitimately, a figure consistent since his inauguration. Views on election integrity and acceptance of the2024 results are closely linked. Among those confident in vote accuracy, 92% are prepared to accept this year's results, compared to 61% of those who lack confidence in the count.Partisan differences are evident in the survey. While 90% of Democrats express confidence in the vote count and 96% believe Biden was legitimately elected, only 48% of Republicans share this confidence, with just 30% acknowledging Biden's legitimacy. Independents are somewhat in the middle, with 64% confident in the vote count and 66% believing Biden's win was legitimate.Ideology also plays a role. Eighty percent or more of liberals, moderates, and somewhat conservatives are prepared to accept the election results. However, only 64% of very conservatives feel the same. Confidence in vote accuracy is lowest among very conservatives (38%) and highest among liberals (89%).The poll, conducted online, surveyed 2,496 adults. The sample reflects partisan divisions of 29% Democrats, 29% Republicans, and 30% independents, with a margin of error of 2 percentage points.This survey underscores the polarized nature of American politics as the 2024 election approaches, highlighting varying levels of acceptance and confidence across the political spectrum.","Support for accepting the election results varies significantly by political affiliation.

We are better prepared and in better conditions than in 2019.""The government called the power outage ""electrical sabotage"" and said that nobody can take away the peace of the Venezulan people.“Nobody will take away our peace and tranquility of the Venezuelan people,” Freddy Nanez, the communications minister, wrote in a message shared with journalists on Telegram, as per AP news agency.He further explained that all 24 Venezuelan states had been at least partially affected by the outage, characterizing it as a ""desperate"" attempt by Maduro's opponents to forcefully remove him from power.By evening, power had been restored in many areas of the capital following a day of intermittent outages. Maduro, appearing on state TV, expressed gratitude to Venezuelans for their patience after a tumultuous day that saw businesses close, hospitals rely on backup power, and the closure of Caracas' subway system, leaving thousands stranded.Despite the disruption, residents of the capital remained resilient. Traffic during the typically busy rush hour was lighter than usual, and some people reported difficulties communicating with family members due to a lack of cellphone service. Alejandra Martinez, a 25-year-old salesclerk, noticed the power outage when a fan stopped working but initially thought it would be short-lived. However, upon waking up, she realized it was a more extensive outage, reported AP news agency.Venezuela's power grid is heavily dependent on the Guri Dam, a massive hydroelectric power station that was inaugurated in the late 1960s. The electrical system has been strained by poor maintenance, a lack of alternative energy sources, and a loss of engineering talent as an estimated 8 million Venezuelans have fled the country's economic hardships in recent years.","Venezuela's capital Caracas and much of the rest of the country were plunged into a blackout on Friday and the government blamed it on sabotage by the opposition.

Explosive Trump biopic to hit US theaters before election: Reports,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/explosive-trump-biopic-to-hit-us-theaters-before-election-reports/articleshow/112938820.cms,"LOS ANGELES: A controversial biopic of Donald Trump that depicts the former president raping his wife and which has drawn legal threats from his attorneys will hit US theaters this October, it was reported Friday.Tiny indie studio Briarcliff Entertainment plans to release "" The Apprentice "" for US audiences less than a month before Trump takes on Kamala Harris in the country's razor-tight presidential election, the Hollywood Reporter said.Representatives for Briarcliff did not immediately respond to AFP queries.The explosive film about Trump's younger years caused shockwaves at the Cannes Film Festival in May.Its most talked about scene shows Trump raping his first wife, Ivana, after she belittles him for growing fat and bald.In real life, Ivana accused Trump of raping her during divorce proceedings but later rescinded the allegation. She died in 2022.The movie also shows Trump suffering erectile dysfunction, and undergoing liposuction and surgery for hair loss.Just hours after ""The Apprentice"" premiered in May, Trump's lawyers vowed to sue the producers, calling the film ""garbage"" and ""pure malicious defamation.""Further complicating the film's prospects for US release is that one of its early financial backers was pro-Trump billionaire Dan Snyder, who was reportedly displeased with its depiction of Trump and sought to block the movie.He has now been bought out of his financial stake in the movie, according to the Hollywood Reporter. The film is set to be released in US theaters October 11, the Los Angeles Times said.Sebastian Stan's lead performance as young New York property tycoon Trump received largely positive reviews at Cannes.The film's screenplay was written by Gabriel Sherman, a journalist who covered real estate for the New York Observer and regularly spoke to Trump.Far from a simple hatchet job, the film depicts Trump as an ambitious but naive social climber desperately trying to navigate the cutthroat world of Manhattan property deals and politics.The Times of London argued it would ""make you feel sympathy for Trump.""But Trump's decency is gradually eroded as he learns the dark arts of dealmaking and power from his mentor Roy Cohn, played by ""Succession"" star Jeremy Strong.Film director Ali Abbasi told AFP he included the rape scene to show how Trump distanced himself from ""human relationships that define him and that hold him in check as a human being.""Stan, best known from the Marvel superhero movies, added that Trump's early behavior ""is much more relatable than we want to admit.""Briarcliff Entertainment launched in the late 2010s. Its founder Tom Ortenberg previously helped steer Oscar campaigns for best picture winners ""Spotlight"" and ""Crash.""He is expected to promote ""The Apprentice"" in Hollywood's upcoming award season.The news comes on the same day ""Reagan,"" another biopic of a former Republican president, Ronald Reagan, hits US theaters.","Briarcliff Entertainment plans to release ""The Apprentice "" for US audiences.

Among the victims, three are in life-threatening condition, one is seriously injured, and the fifth has minor wounds.The recent violence echoes a stabbing attack in Solingen, where a 26-year-old Syrian man, who was pending deportation to Bulgaria, carried out a deadly assault.This incident sparked significant debate over Germany's immigration policies.In response to the rising violence, Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s government has introduced new regulations, including restrictions on carrying knives in public and on long-distance transport. Additional measures include limiting benefits for some illegal migrants.Earlier this week, police also fatally shot a man suspected of attacking pedestrians with knives in Moers, a town near Solingen.","A 32-year-old woman was arrested after stabbing five people on a bus in Siegen, western Germany, on Friday.

She’s a defective person, and we don’t need another defective person as President of the United States.""Trump’s appearance at the annual Moms for Liberty event was a strategic move to galvanize support among his base. The group, known for its efforts to remove mentions of LGBTQ+ identity and structural racism from K-12 curricula, has been a significant force in conservative circles. The majority of its 130,000-plus members support Trump's stance on education and oppose racial equity programs and transgender accommodations in schools.However, Trump risks alienating moderate voters who view Moms for Liberty's activism as too extreme. The group's influence, once seen as a potential asset for the Republican ticket, has recently faced scrutiny due to scandals and lackluster local results.Moms for Liberty has also been linked to Project 2025, a controversial blueprint for a conservative presidency that Trump has distanced himself from. Despite this, the group remains active, with notable successes in recent Florida primaries and endorsements of several first-time candidates.At the conference, Trump did not reveal specifics about his speech but highlighted his education proposals, including promoting school choice and opposing transgender athletes in girls' sports. He also criticized the Biden administration's approach to public education.The event, marked by a lively atmosphere and Trump’s characteristic style, included his usual rhetoric on illegal immigration and manufacturing. Amidst the festivities, Trump continued to criticize Harris and Democratic policies, using the occasion to reinforce his campaign themes.As Trump addressed the crowd, he underscored his stance on issues like fossil fuel production, leveraging Pennsylvania’s significance to bolster his arguments. Despite the festive mood, the event was also marked by an incident involving a man who breached the media area before being subdued by law enforcement.","Former President Donald Trump spoke at the Moms for Liberty conference on Friday.

Binninger addressed the media outside the courthouse, stating, “My client is accepting responsibility. He’s doing everything in his power to cooperate, to help in this situation, and he’s incredibly remorseful.”Binninger emphasized that Chavez’s remorse is focused on the tragedy of Perry’s death rather than the actor's celebrity status. “The regret stems from the fact that someone who was trying to seek treatment died,” Binninger said.Chavez's case is part of a broader investigation involving multiple defendants.

The two divorced in 2017. Behn, who had discussed suffering from depression, died on Christmas Day 2019. King Harald, 88, is one of Europe's longest-serving monarchs.Martha claims to be a clairvoyant and she has invited a lot of criticism for that. She lost her honorific ""Her Royal Highness"" title in 2002 to start her own business. She ran a school in which she taught students to create miracles and talk to angels.Verrett claims to be a a sixth generation shaman, “servant of god and energy activator” who “demystifies spirituality” through his “no-nonsense teachings”.

Kamala Harris: How Kamala Harris defended her policy shifts on fracking in CNN interview,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-kamala-harris-defended-her-policy-shifts-on-fracking-in-cnn-interview/articleshow/112931758.cms,"When questioned about her shift from liberal to more moderate policy positions, Harris emphasized that her core values have remained consistent, citing her commitment to addressing climate change as an example. In response to questions about her reversal on banning fracking — a method used to extract gas and oil from shale rock — Harris expressed confidence that U.S.climate goals could still be met without enforcing such a ban.Republicans have largely criticized Harris by portraying her as an extremist, often pointing to her 2019 statements to support their claims. At that time, she advocated for closing immigration detention centres and decriminalizing illegal border crossings. Her stance on border issues has since become more stringent, emphasizing her experience ""prosecuting transnational, criminal organizations"" during her time as California's attorney general.Earlier this year, Harris supported a bipartisan border security bill that allocated hundreds of millions of dollars for additional wall construction. Trump urged Republicans in Congress to oppose the bill, a move Harris described in a CNN interview as a cynical political tactic.For weeks, Republicans have criticized Harris for her changes in stance, labeling her a flip-flopper and warning that she is a ""dangerously liberal"" contender for the White House.Trump — who has also changed his stance on various issues this year, including abortion and the TikTok ban — mocked Harris for her policy shifts at a rally on Thursday. “She probably goes back to her room and gets sick to her stomach when she says what she says,” the former president told supporters in Michigan. “She’s a Marxist, she’s a fascist, and she never believed. Now she’s saying, ‘Oh, we want to build a strong border.’ Where has she been for 3 1/2 years?”The American public is ready to ""turn the page"" on Donald Trump Kamala Harris has stated, claiming that her Republican rival is promoting an agenda that ""divides"" the country and ""diminishes the character"" of its people. In her first major television interview of her presidential campaign , the 59-year-old US Vice President, who will face Trump in the 5th November elections, said that Americans are prepared for a ""new way forward"".""I think sadly in the last decade, we have had in the former president someone who has really been pushing an agenda and an environment that is about diminishing the character and the strength of who we are as Americans — really dividing our nation,"" Harris said in a joint interview with her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, on CNN.""And I think people are ready to turn the page on that,"" Harris, the Democratic Party 's candidate, added.""The American people are ready for a new way forward. Our former president has pushed an agenda that diminishes the character and strength of who we are as Americans, and divides our nation. People are ready to turn the page,"" she reiterated in a post on X, linking to an interview snippet.Harris, who is of Indian and African heritage, also refused to engage in Trump's identity politics during the interview.She sidestepped questions regarding Trump's claims about her racial identity, describing them as part of the ""same old tired playbook.""Last month, Trump questioned Harris' racial identity at the National Association of Black Journalists conference in Chicago, implying that she had previously identified as South Asian but ""happened to turn Black"" for political reasons.Her decision not to comment aligns with her campaign's strategy to avoid focusing on identity politics following Trump's remarks, CNN reported.When asked about a previous debate on the decriminalisation of US borders, she responded, ""I believe there should be consequence. We have laws that have to be followed and enforced that address and deal with people who cross our border illegally. And there should be consequence.""Harris further stated that she is the ""only person"" in the presidential race who has ""prosecuted transnational criminal organisations who traffic in guns, drugs, and human beings"".""I'm the only person in this race who actually served a border state as attorney general to enforce our laws. And I would enforce our laws as president going forward. I recognise the problem,"" she said.Referring to the border as a ""very significant"" immigration issue for Americans and for US security, she mentioned a border security bill that was drafted under the administration of her boss — incumbent President Joe Biden She pointed out that Trump blocked the bill that would have added 1,500 additional agents at the border, as it ""would not have helped him politically"".Speaking about Biden, she remarked that serving alongside him for nearly four years has been ""one of the greatest honours of my career"".""He has the intelligence, the commitment and the judgement – disposition that I think the American people rightly deserve in their president,"" she said.Last month, Biden withdrew from the presidential race, stating that it was in ""the best interest"" of the Democratic Party and the country to do so. He endorsed Harris as the party's nominee.Harris also mentioned that she would appoint a Republican to serve in her Cabinet if elected.","Kamala Harris said that Donald Trump is promoting an agenda that ""divides"" the country and ""diminishes the character"" of its people.

The Republican vice-presidential nominee attempted to pre-emptively mock Kamala Harris ' much-anticipated interview on Thursday night by posting a 2007 video clip of Caitlin Upton , who represented South Carolina in that year's Miss Teen USA pageant.In the clip, Upton is seen badly fumbling a response to a question about Americans' inability to locate their own country on a map. CNN's John Berman challenged Vance over the difficulties that the contestant later faced.""So when you posted this last night, were you aware that the woman you are posting a picture of had contemplated committing suicide for the attention that it received?"" Berman asked.Vance insisted he hadn't been aware of Upton's struggles after that video clip went viral nearly two decades ago, and Donald Trump's running mate claimed the post was merely a light-hearted attempt at humour.""No, certainly not, John, and my heart goes out to her and I hope that she's doing well,"" Vance responded. ""Look, I've said a lot of things on camera, I've said a lot of stupid things on camera. Sometimes when you're in the public eye, you make mistakes and, again, I think the best way to deal with it is to laugh at ourselves, laugh at this stuff, and try to have some fun in politics. I posted a meme from 20 years ago, and I think the fact that we're talking about that instead of the fact that American families can't afford groceries or healthcare, young families can't afford to buy a home to raise their families, and those are the real crises that we should focus on, and there's nothing that says we can't tell some jokes along the way while we deal with the very serious business of bringing back our public policy.""""Politics has gotten way too lame, John, way too boring,"" Vance added. ""You can have some fun while making a good argument to the American people about how you're going to improve their lives.""Berman wasn't satisfied with his response and asked whether he was prepared to apologise for bringing up that embarrassing moment in such a public way.""I just want to be clear, though – you said you didn't know,"" Berman pressed. ""Would you like to apologise to Caitlin Upton for posting that last night, given what you've now learned?""Trump's running mate declined the opportunity to apologise to Upton, who is now 35.""John, I'm not going to apologise for posting a joke, but I wish the best for Caitlin,"" Vance said.
