Here's what happened after the ceasefire

Just hours after the ceasefire agreement, J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah questioned the truce deal as Srinagar was jolted by loud explosions on Saturday evening. “What the hell just happened to the ceasefire? Explosions heard across Srinagar!!! This is no ceasefire. The air defence units in the middle of Srinagar just opened up,” Abdullah posted on X.

questioned the truce deal as Srinagar was jolted by loud explosions on Saturday evening. “What the hell just happened to the ceasefire? Explosions heard across Srinagar!!! This is no ceasefire. The air defence units in the middle of Srinagar just opened up,” Abdullah posted on X. Earlier, the US had taken credit for the ceasefire, as according to CNN, it had been told that it was Vice President JD Vance who finally called Prime Minister Modi ""at noon Eastern time on Friday"" to urge him to get India to talk directly to Pakistan ""to consider options available for de-escalation"". According to CNN, the officials said Vance first took the intelligence to Trump and then called PM Modi to tell him that the US believed that if hostilities continued over the weekend, there was ""a high probability of a dramatic escalation"".

Sirens blared and explosions echoed across border states on Saturday evening as Pakistan once again launched drones into Indian airspace. Loud blasts were reported in Srinagar, while air raid sirens went off in Udhampur and other parts of the Jammu region.

Blackouts were enforced in several areas across Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, and Rajasthan as a precaution amid what marks another Pakistani drone intrusion in a series of nighttime provocations.

An alert sentry at Nagrota Military Station thwarted a possible intrusion with timely action, triggering a brief exchange of fire and sustaining minor injuries, the Army's White Knight Corps said. A search operation was also launched for the suspect.

Foreign secretary Vikram Misri held a press briefing after the ceasefire violation and said: "" For the last few hours, this understanding is being violated by Pakistan. The Indian Army is retaliating and dealing with this border intrusion. This intrusion is extremely condemnable and Pakistan is responsible for it. We believe that Pakistan should understand this situation properly and take appropriate action immediately to stop this intrusion.""

Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi had a phone conversation with Indian National Security Advisor Doval. As per Chinese foreign ministry, ""Doval said that the Pahalgam terrorist attack caused serious casualties among Indian personnel and that India needed to take counter-terrorism actions. War was not India's choice and was not in the interests of any party. India and Pakistan would be committed to a ceasefire and look forward to restoring regional peace and stability as soon as possible.""

as soon as possible."" External affairs minister Jaishankar said after the ceasefire that India and Pakistan had reached an understanding to stop ""firing and military action."" He further reiterated New Delhi's ""uncompromising stance"" against terrorism in all its forms.

After the ceasefire violation, the government gave the Indian armed forces instructions to deal strongly with any instances of repetition of the violations along the LoC and international border.

Amritsar was placed under a red alert early Sunday morning following heightened security concerns, with district authorities urging residents to remain indoors. The situation in Jammu city remained normal on Sunday, a day after intense shelling from Pakistan. No drones, firing and shelling were reported during the intervening night of May 10-11. The situation was also normal in Poonch area after no drones, firing and shelling were reported during the night.

India's BIG ULTIMATUM As Pakistan Army Violates Ceasefire; Vows 'Strong Response' | FULL

NEW DELHI: India and Pakistan agreed to an immediate ceasefire on Saturday, following a sharp escalation in cross-border tensions triggered by the deadly April 22 terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir 's Pahalgam.The breakthrough came after what the US President Donald Trump called ""intense diplomatic engagement"" over the past two days.The tension began when Pakistan-backed terrorists killed 26 civilians in Pahalgam.In retaliation, India launched ' Operation Sindoor ' on May 7, carrying out precision strikes on nine terror camps located in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK).Pakistan responded with drone attacks targeting areas in Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Rajasthan, and Gujarat. These attacks were intercepted by Indian defence systems but raised fears of a broader conflict between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.Amid growing concern, the United States played a key role in de-escalating the situation. US secretary of state Marco Rubio said he and Vice President JD Vance held discussions with senior officials from both countries. Rubio also commended PM Modi and Pakistan for choosing dialogue over confrontation.However, just a few hours after the ceasefire declaration, violation was witnessed by Pakistan in Srinagar and other border areas.Before the ceasefire was announced, India, in a drastic revision of its security doctrine, Saturday declared that it would from now on consider every instance of terrorism directed against it as an ""act of war"" and would respond accordingly.Sources explained that the decision considerably lowers the threshold for India to give full-scale military response to attacks orchestrated from across the border. Although India responded militarily to terrorist attacks in Uri in 2016, Pulwama in 2019 and, most recently, Pahalgam by exercising the military option, the decision on Saturday bakes the new security posture into a doctrine.","J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah questioned the truce deal as Srinagar was jolted by loud explosions on Saturday evening.

NEW DELHI: While the Indian Army and IAF denied Pakistani claims of having inflicted heavy damage upon Indian military installations , the govt called out Pakistan for alleging Indian missiles hit Afghanistan, with foreign secretary Vikram Misri recalling Islamabad's own track record of attacking civilians in the country.Misri also hit out at Pakistan army for targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure in J&K and Punjab and for its attempts to sow division by repeatedly claiming that India had fired missiles at Shri Amritsar Sahib.""There is this completely ludicrous claim that Indian missiles have hit Afghanistan. And I only want to point out that Afghan people don't need to be reminded about which country it is, that has on multiple occasions, in just the last one-and-a-half years, targeted civilian populations and civilian infrastructure in Afghanistan,"" the foreign secretary said. He was referring to the recent Pakistani air strikes inside Afghanistan against attacks launched by the Pakistan Taliban allegedly from Afghan soil.The official also slammed Pakistan for rejoicing over criticism of the Indian govt by Indian nationals over ""various issues"".""It may be a surprise to Pakistan to see citizens criticising their own govt. That is the hallmark of an open and functioning democracy. Pakistan's unfamiliarity with that, again, should not be surprising,"" Misri said.The foreign secretary stressed how Pakistan continues with its ""execrable and wanton"" campaign of targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure, especially in J&K and Punjab. There was also a consistent attempt on Pakistan's part to sow discord between communities in India, he said.""There has been a particular focus in its targeting of civilian infrastructure and the population in Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab. Earlier this morning, Pakistan shelled the town of Rajouri, killing the additional district development commissioner Raj Kumar Thapa, adding to the civilian casualties and the damage in that state,"" Misri said, highlighting overnight damage to property and injuries to civilians in Ferozepur and Jalandhar, among other places.

This came even as the opposition party has offered its support to the government in its efforts against terrorism after the Pahalgam attack that killed 26 people on April 22.""At a time when the nation stands united as Indians, this petty attempt to divide us politically is deplorable. Our government has learned the futility of past approaches the hard way -- after inviting Pakistan to participate in the investigation of the Pathankot blasts in 2016. It is only then that it took to the path of military action, carefully calibrated and maturely conducted. This advertisement is neither appropriate nor mature. Delete it, please, @BJP4India,"" Tharoor said in a post on X. BJP posted a video on X criticising the UPA regime for its ""passivity"" and calling it out on its ""futile peace talks"" with Pakistan.""The message to the enemies is loud and clear. Don't mess with us! Unlike the UPA regime’s passivity, New India has no patience for futile peace talks,"" it said.Tharoor's reaction comes at a time when his appreciation for the Modi-government in certain foreign policies made headlines fueling rumours of rift with the grand old party. BJP leader Amit Malviya even took a jibe at him calling him PM Modi's fan after he sided with the current government's stance on Russia-Ukraine policy. ""Prime Minister Modi needs new haters… Old ones are turning into his fans,"" Malviya had said.Additionally, his presence at Vizhinjam port inauguration and sharing stage with PM Modi gained attention after the prime minister said that the event would give ""sleepless nights to several people"" taking a jibe at INDIA bloc.However, BJP leader CR Kesavan criticised Congress saying, ""We salute the exemplary courage and unparalleled commitment of our brave armed forces in decisively defeating the cowardly attacks of Pakistan on Bharat and our civilians...But unfortunately, the poisonous political propaganda of the Congress Party and their noxious fake narratives have now been weaponised by the enemy state of Pakistan...After Operation Sindoor commenced, Udit Raj of the Congress Party gave the name Operation Sindoor a communal colour. So the Congress Party is failing the nation again and again. It's high time they stop politicising the army and stop their fake factory of false narratives...""Meanwhile, India and Pakistan have agreed to stop the military action against each other with the former categorically maintaining ""a firm and uncompromising stance against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations"".""India and Pakistan have today worked out an understanding on stoppage of firing and military action.

Lashkar’s Muridke HQ chief among 140 terrorists killed in Operation Sindoor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lashkars-muridke-hq-chief-among-140-terrorists-killed-in-op-sindoor-india-pakistan/articleshow/121066914.cms,"This time, message was clear: India knows where to find & hit terrorists

NEW DELHI: India's Operation Sindoor, conducted on the night of May 6 and 7, resulted in the elimination of around a dozen high-value terrorists in Pakistan, including IC-814 hijacker Yusuf Azhar , chief of Lashkar's Muridke headquarters Abu Jundal aka Mudassar, and the son of the 2016 Nagrota attack plotter.Sources termed the deaths of the jihadi commanders as a severe setback to Pakistan's military-terror nexus, adding that fresh estimates show that at least 130-140 terrrorists were killed in the strikes India launched to avenge Pahalgam killings.The precision strikes also exposed the thin veil that had been long placed between the Pakistani govt and its terror proxies with the funerals of jihadi A-listers being attended by the military-political establishment.Mudassar, the head of LeT's headquarters at Muridike and one of the most notorious figures among the killed, received a guard of honour by Pakistan army at his funeral.Indian intelligence has gathered video evidence, which prove that a wreath was laid on behalf of Pak army chief Asim Munir and Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz. ""His funeral prayer was held in a govt school. A serving Lt General of Pakistan army and IG of Punjab Police attended the prayer,"" a senior intelligence officer said.Another high-value target was Yusuf Azhar, who went by the alias of Ustad and was a wanted man with an Interpol Red Notice. He was a brother-in-law of Maulana Masood Azhar, who had covertly entered India using a fake passport arranged by his handler Abdul Latif, prior to the 1998 Kandahar hijacking.India had formally requested Pakistan to take action against him, listing him as a wanted terrorist in 2002. However, he had continued to operate from Jaish-e-Mohammed 's Markaz Subhan Allah at Bahawalpur, which was destroyed in the strikes. Masood Azhar's eldest brother-in-law Hafiz Muhammed Jameel was also killed in the strikes, sources confirmed. He was in charge of the Markaz at Bahawalpur.The other high-value target was Abu Akasha alias Khalid, affiliated with Lashkar-e-Taiba . He was involved in multiple terrorist attacks in J&K and was engaged in weapons smuggling from Afghanistan, sources said. ""His funeral was held in Faisalabad and attended by senior Pakistani army officials and deputy commissioner of Faisalabad,"" said a senior officer.The Indian surgical strike also resulted in the elimination of Jaish's Mohammad Hassan Khan, son of Mufti Asghar Khan Kashmiri, operational commander of JeM in POK. He played a key role in coordinating terrorist attacks in J&K, including the Nagrota attack.""This time, the message was loud and clear: India knows where to find the perpetrators of heinous attacks, from Parliament in 2001 to the Pahalgam attack. The carefully drawn list of targets effectively communicated that India can strike at will, settling a two-decade-old score,"" the officer added.The biggest outcome of Operation Sindoor was the destruction of Muridke and Bahawalpur - terror sanctuaries that thrived for decades.Markaz Subhan Allah, JeM's primary hub for training and indoctrination of jihadis, was spread across 15 acres. It was here that Maulana Masood Azhar had resurfaced on Nov 30, 2024, addressing cadres for the first time in two years. His speech reiterated anti-India rhetoric, vowing revenge for construction of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya.Over a dozen major terror strikes, including the 2019 Pulwama attack, were planned here. The perpetrators of the Pulwama attack had even trained at this facility, which was home to over 600 cadres and hosted regular training sessions for JeM members.India had dealt the first major blow to the Pak-sponsored terror factories in 2019 by bombing terror camps at Balakot, regarded as the 'first launchpad for jihad'.","India's Operation Sindoor, conducted on the night of May 6 and 7, resulted in the elimination of around a dozen high-value terrorists in Pakistan.

Srinagar: While India and Pakistan agreed to a pause in firing and military action, with no mention of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) which India has put in abeyance, two gates of the Baglihar dam were thrown open on Saturday, causing Chenab River to swell.Sources said two gates of the dam remained open from around 8.30am till 4.30pm. The gates were opened to regulate rising water levels triggered by heavy rainfall in the region on Friday.The IWT gives India exclusive rights to use the waters of the eastern rivers - Sutlej, Beas and Ravi - and their tributaries, before they enter Pakistan, while the latter secured rights over the waters of the western rivers - Chenab, Jhelum and Indus.Following the Pahalgam terror attack, India put the treaty in abeyance.On May 3, National Conference president and former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir , Farooq Abdullah , said his party had consistently opposed the IWT as it was harming the interests of J&K, and asserted that it was time to divert Chenab water to Jammu and harness power from the Jhelum in Kashmir. ""We have been saying for a long time that this treaty has to be reviewed,"" he added.NC has maintained that the IWT gave away the rights over the rivers to Pakistan without consulting J&K, and the treaty should be re-looked.In March 2003, J&K legislative council had adopted a resolution moved by NC, then in opposition, asking the Union govt to review the IWT with a view to safeguarding the interests of the UT (then a state). In 2011, Omar Abdullah, as the then CM, had asked compensation from the central govt on account of losses incurred by the State due to the IWT. In 2010, J&K government had accorded sanction to engage a consultant to quantify the losses suffered by J&K because of the treaty.","Two gates of the Baglihar dam were thrown open on Saturday, causing Chenab River to swell.

NEW DELHI: Reacting to the announcement of pause in Indo-Pak hostilities by US President Donald Trump , Congress demanded that PM Narendra Modi chair an all-party meeting and convene a special session of Parliament to discuss the recent events and demonstrate national unity for future.The demand was accompanied by a Congress lament that ""India today misses Indira Gandhi"", in what appeared a veiled jibe at Modi over the US-mediated end to hostilities with the belligerent neighbour and the assertion that Indira Gandhi had rebuffed pressure from the superpower.Congress spokesperson Jairam Ramesh posted the letter written by Indira to US President Richard Nixon on Dec 12, 1971, and ""four days later Pakistan surrendered"". He said Indira ensured that there was no ""neutral site which has now been agreed to"".Party spokesperson Pawan Khera said it was ""unprecedented"" that India came to know about the pause in hostilities from Trump and not any Indian official.Ramesh said, ""In view of the unprecedented announcements from Washington DC, there is now a need, more than ever before, for the PM to chair an all-party meeting and take political parties into confidence, and a special session of Parliament to discuss the events of the last 18 days, beginning with the brutal Pahalgam terror attacks and the way forward, and to demonstrate a collective resolve.""Khera said the questions that arise out of the Trump announcement can only be asked at a special session and in an all-party meeting.","Congress demands that PM Narendra Modi chair an all-party meeting and convene a special session of Parliament.

"India-Pakistan agreement: Pause disappoints hardliners, others say it's a win for India",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-pakistan-ceasefire-agreement-pause-disappoints-hardliners-others-say-its-a-win-for-india/articleshow/121069537.cms,"Kashmiri men react after the pause in conflict, in Srinagar on Saturday

NEW DELHI: When India struck terror facilities hard in Pakistan on Wednesday, for many the act underlined the govt's seriousness of response to the heinous Pahalgam massacre on April 22. Since then, as the Army continued to display the same intensity of intent, both in its offensive and defensive manoeuvres, the public mood on social media platforms largely favoured a military action strong enough to guarantee a deterrent both for terrorists and their handlers.In this prevailing ambience, the Saturday announcement that pauses the raging conflict has been lauded by some but also seen by others as letting Pakistan off the hook.Foreign affairs analyst Brahma Chellaney wondered on X, ""Does this mean that Prime Minister Modi has decided not to take ' Operation Sindoor ' to its logical conclusion by ending, once and for all, the Pakistani military generals' four-decade-long strategy of waging a 'war of a thousand cuts' against India through terrorist proxies?""In a detailed post issued shortly later, he said, ""Snatching defeat from the jaws of victory has long been an Indian political tradition"", and gave examples of India erring in similar fashion against both China and Pakistan over the decades.Chellaney said that India agreed to a ceasefire against Pakistan in 1948 when the Army was marching toward victory. Again, in 1972, at Shimla, India gave away its 1971 ""war gains at the negotiating table without securing anything in return from Pakistan.""True Indology, a pro-right handle with over 330,000 followers, blamed the US for allegedly denying India the triumph it deserved. ""A very well-deserved victory of the Indian army has been neutralized by cheap US politics. Ultimately, Pakistan will continue to exist. It is only a matter of time before Pakistan launches terror attacks into India. This is very disappointing as all our sacrifices resulted in nothing once again. Not an inch of the land illegally occupied by Pakistan has been gained. The dagger to stab India's back has been protected once more.""However, columnist Amrita Bhinder, whose followers include PM Modi, read the announcement as an ""inking"" of India's stance. ""New beginnings. War can be won in so many different ways. The 'right wing' guys (Trump-Modi) have shifted the war from bloodshed to trade. Money talks. India gets to grow economically. Pakistan has to worry about water.""Rishi Bagree, who has nearly five lakh followers on X and has been backing the govt during the conflict, listed what he felt were India's gains. ""1. Took revenge of (sic) Pahalgam by hitting 24 terror targets deep inside Pakistan. 2. Destroyed (sic) their 7 Air bases 3. Status Quo on the Indus water treaty will continue, with India sharing NO data and will continue to construct New dams on the Rivers. 4. The USA has accepted India's new War doctrine - Any act of terror by a non-state actor will be viewed as an act of war by India and will attract full retaliation,"" he posted.","The Saturday announcement that pauses the raging conflict has been lauded by some but also seen by others as letting Pakistan off the hook.

'Pakistan has got a befitting reply to the misadventure they conducted in Pahalgam': Sachin Pilot to TOI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-has-got-a-befitting-reply-to-the-misadventure-they-conducted-in-pahalgam-sachin-pilot-to-toi/articleshow/121068868.cms,"Sachin Pilot (File photo)

Cong’s

told TOI’s Subodh Ghildiyal Osama bin Laden was found hiding in a Pakistan military town and India has again exposed Pakistan as a country that harbours terror. Excerpts:

India did what had to be done, has again exposed Pak as terror haven: Pilot

Subodh Ghildiyal

How do you view India’s offensive response against Pakistan?

You mean after Osama, Pakistan has again been exposed for its terror links?

What do you say about Congress’s stand on the post-Pahalgam situation?

Is there a shift in Congress’s stand?

How do you see the whole situation as an army man?

Why did Congress take the decision to pause its political activities?

Congress leader and Territorial Army officer Sachin Pilot said Osama bin Laden was found hiding in a Pakistan military town and India has again exposed Pakistan as a country that harbours terror.He toldthat India has done what needed to be done post-Pahalgam, and Congress stands firmly with the govt and the armed forces.The valour and bravery of the Indian armed forces is second to none, and Pakistan has got a befitting reply to the misadventure they conducted in Pahalgam. The brutal killings of innocent tourists was intolerable. India has responded adequately, the attack on terror infrastructure was imminent, it had to be done. The Indian armed forces have done an exemplary job of avoiding civilian casualties and targeting those areas and individuals who have always propagated terror in India.We should not forget that it was Pakistan that gave a safe haven to Osama bin Laden, and that too in Abbottabad, which is a military station. It shows that the Pakistan military was involved in protecting Osama. In fact, all the known terrorists, like Masood Azhar, Hafiz Saeed, have been associated with the State of Pakistan. Now, Pakistan is calling for a fair inquiry, but inquiry into the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks clearly showed that Pakistan was directly involved in those attacks.Pakistan has been directly involved in all terror attacks that have taken place in India in the last 20 years. That is why Pakistan is in the UN watch list of nations harbouring terror. Pakistan has to be taught a lesson and I think time has come to eradicate terror from its root. Pakistan cannot conduct these barbaric atrocities on Indian soil any more.It is well documented and world acknowledges it. Senior Pakistani ministers have said for decades that Pakistan used terror as a state policy and harboured and nurtured terror camps. It is beyond doubt. That is why Pakistan has not got any support from any major player in the world.The day the Pahalgam terror attack happened, the Congress president immediately announced that Congress, as the principal opposition party, stood with the govt in any adequate response that needed to be given to Pakistan. The Congress Working Committee passed a unanimous resolution supporting the govt. Rahul Gandhi said the same. Whatever our differing political opinions and ideologies within, when it comes to the nation and to countering Pakistani terror, we are united. The 1.4 billion people support the action taken by the armed forces.There are no two views on the issue. Let’s not forget that when Indira Gandhi as PM was forced into a corner and a war had to be waged to break Pakistan into two parts and Bangladesh was created, entire country, including Atal Bihari Vajpayee, supported her actions. When Parliament was attacked on Dec 13, Sonia Gandhi as leader of opposition told PM Vajpayee on the floor of the house that entire Congress and opposition was with him in giving Pakistan a befitting reply. The same tradition continues. Whether Congress is in govt or opposition, we always have the policy of ‘nation first’ and zero tolerance on terror. It is Congress that has lost its leaders to terror, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi. We know how to fight terror. We are on the frontlines of fighting terror. And, Indian security, life of its citizens, is far more important that any other political issue or ideology.There is a general concern about escalation.Look. What was needed to be done has been done and now we have to wait and watch how the situation develops. There is a flood of good and bad information in the public domain. The all-party meeting has happened. Some information cannot be divulged in national interest, and I, too, won’t comment on it. But the Indian people are behind the govt and the armed forces in fighting terror. We have never tried to disturb any country but when faced with a challenge, we fight with full force. Whatever the consequences, terror has to be rooted out from Pakistani terrain. The entire world supports India and Congress stands with the armed forces.Besides being a politician, I do serve in the Territorial Army, and I could not be more proud of what our defence forces have done over last 70 years and continue to do. We owe a large debt to all those in uniform. The armed forces have shown that they are second to none. The technology, bravery and precision involved in the way the army conducted these operations shows that it is a world class organisation. We are best not just in tech and equipment but also in morale and love for the motherland.Because this is a tense moment for all of us and there is action on the border. As a party, we suspended our political activities for the moment in support of our armed forces and also for families who have sent their young ones to the border.","Sachin Pilot: India has done what needed to be done post-Pahalgam. Pakistan has been directly involved in all terror attacks that have taken place in India in the last 20 years, he says. Pilot: Pakistan has to be taught a lesson and I think time has come to eradicate terror from its root.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121068945,imgsize-883649,width-400,resizemode-4/article-88.jpg"

LONDON: Sky News has traced social media accounts expressing support for jihadist terrorist groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and al-Qaida to the exact location of the building in Muridke, Pakistan, which was struck by India last week in retaliation for the Pahalgam terrorist attack .A Sky News forensics and data team geolocated to Markaz Taiba in Muridke multiple videos on TikTok, YouTube and Google which express support for the LeT and ""313"", referring to the 313 Brigade , al-Qaida's military wing in Pakistan.The videos were posted before India blew the complex up last week. The channel confirmed the video locations using satellite imagery in and around the complex.According to Stanford University's mapping militants project, members of 313 Brigade include Taliban and allied jihadist groups, such as Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami, LeT and Jaish-e-Muhammed . 313 Brigade has been behind many high-profile attacks and bombings inside Pakistan.Captions, hashtags and usernames posting these videos express support for either or both the LeT and ""313"".

The Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) told Sky News: ""It has been known for decades that LeT has its headquarters in Muridke.""Pakistan-based Resistance Front, an LeT proxy, initially claimed responsibility for the Pahalgam attack. Khawaja Asif, Pakistan's defence minister, said: ""This appears to be a random video with background music added later - consistent with how TikTok trends often function. If this is to be considered credible evidence, we could produce millions of similar clips ourselves."" Any suggestion that the mosque was used as a base by terrorists was a ""completely false social media made up hoax,"" he added.","Sky News traced social media accounts expressing support for jihadist terrorist groups to the exact location of the building in Muridke, Pakistan.

JAISALMER\CHANDIGARH: Multiple missiles and drones launched from Pakistan were intercepted and destroyed by Indian forces in Jaisalmer, Barmer and other Rajasthan districts Saturday.Many spots in Punjab's Ferozepur, Bathinda, Jalandhar and Amritsar reported damage to homes and farms as debris from weapons lay strewn around.The attacks, which began late Friday night and continued until noon Saturday, occurred just hours before a pause in fighting was announced Saturday evening.Unconfirmed reports suggested some damage to Pathankot airbase in Punjab, though authorities remained tight-lipped on the matter.In Rajasthan, residents across multiple districts reported loud explosions and bright flashes throughout Friday-Saturday night. At least eight missile fragments and drone debris were found in residential areas and fields across Jaisalmer, Barmer and neighbouring Balotra.In Pareu area of Balotra, locals reported a thunderous explosion at 4:45am Saturday, accompanied by intense light that lasted approximately 10 minutes. A large missile-like object, measuring 10-15 feet, was discovered in the area, prompting immediate response from local authorities. Jodhpur range IG Vikas Kumar confirmed the attack, saying the area was secured by Army and Air Force personnel soon after.The impact was particularly hard on Jaisalmer's Bhagu village, where a missile created a 10ft wide and 2ft deep crater around 4:30am Saturday. Similar attacks were reported near Jamla village, where missile debris damaged local fencing as well as a house, though no casualties were reported.In the high-security Pokhran region of Jaisalmer district, missile parts were strewn at four different locations, including areas near Veermdevra and Ugras villages in Ramdeora area. Weapon debris was also found scattered near Dhadu village, in addition to Sankra and Mandwa areas.Throughout the Pakistani offensives, district administrations maintained high alert, with sirens blaring through the night. While no significant damage or casualties were reported, the attacks created an atmosphere of chaos among residents.Indian armed forces successfully intercepted all incoming threats, demonstrating their preparedness in protecting border areas.In Punjab's Ferozepur, Pakistani drones hit private properties in several areas, with the objects falling in fields, causing craters and damaging crops. In Jallupur Khera village of Amritsar, cracks appeared in a building, possibly after being hit by a drone.In Jalandhar's Adampur, possible drone debris were strewn across fields in Alwalpur Kureshian, Mahadipur, and Isharwal Dhandor Chak villages. Adampur MLA Sukhwinder Singh Kotli, who visited all the sites, said that except for one village, the debris did not cause any damage as they fell in open fields.","Residents in Rajasthan reported loud explosions and bright flashes throughout Friday-Saturday night.

CHANDIGARH: A widespread blackout was enforced across several districts of Punjab, Chandigarh, and Haryana’s Panchkula Ambala and Sirsa districts on Thursday night as tensions flared between India and Pakistan following Operation Sindoor and the threat of air strikes.Authorities ordered residents to switch off lights and stay indoors, accompanied by sirens and announcements from the police.Amritsar, Ferozepur, Tarn Taran, Gurdaspur, Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Hoshiarpur, Mohali, and Faridkot districts were subject to blackout orders. In Pathankot, the blackout began at 8.30 pm, coinciding with reports of air raid warnings. Gurdaspur’s blackout started at 9 pm and was extended until further notice.Key facilities like hospitals and the central jail were exempt but were instructed to keep windows closed.Mock drills were conducted in Kapurthala and Phagwara as a precautionary measure. Hospitals in border areas were directed to ensure continuous power supply, maintain sufficient water and fuel reserves, and have backup generators ready.Around 10.30 pm, explosions were reported in Bathinda following sightings of fireballs in the sky.Three to four explosions were heard in quick succession. The administration enforced an immediate blackout and urged residents to remain indoors. Bathinda’s SSP Amneet Kondal, confirmed one explosion near the National Fertilizers Limited (NFL) and stated that the armed forces were investigating.In the same period, an attempted attack near Uchi Bassi village, near Mukerian, was neutralised. A projectile was later recovered from the fields, prompting an immediate blackout order by Hoshiarpur deputy commissioner.Adrone attack was also foiled near Jalandhar’s Maqsudan/Suranasi area later that night. Jalandhar DC Himanshu Aggarwal confirmed that most drones had been neutralised, assuring the public that civilians were not targeted.Earlier, in the early hours of Thursday, a series of explosions and sight of fireballs streaking across the sky set off panic in Amritsar, with reports of “missile debris” found in several villages emerging later in the morning.Around 1 am, six loud explosions were heard within a span of just seven minutes, causing the city to plunge into darkness. The district administration attributed the blasts to possible sonic booms, but residents were left shaken The local administration offered only a brief statement that “Amritsar is safe”, while assuring residents that precautionary measures were in place. Deputy commissioner Sakshi Sawhney said, “We are observing precaution, there is no need to panic. ”The city experienced two blackouts. Police commissioner Gurpreet Bhullar clarified that the blackouts were a temporary measure prompted by the loud noises.By Thursday morning, reports surfaced of missile debris scattered across four villages of Makhanwindi, Jethuwal, Pandher, and Dudhala.

Mayor Eric Adams expressed interest in raising campaign donations from Turkish businessmen during a 2022 dinner, newly unsealed court documents in his dismissed corruption case have revealed.According to filings cited by the New York Post, Adams “welcomed the offer of foreign contributions” and directed a promoter to coordinate with one of his staffers to secure the funds for his 2025 re-election bid The revelations are part of a trove of 1,785 pages of court documents made public after a legal push by multiple media outlets. The documents detail the FBI’s wide-ranging investigation into Adams and offer insight into the evidence federal prosecutors were gathering before the case was abruptly dismissed in April.As per New York Post, the newly unsealed records show Adams attended the January 2022 dinner with two staffers, where the idea of a visit to Turkey to meet potential donors was discussed.The filing notes Adams encouraged further coordination to arrange the contributions, though the documents do not confirm whether the trip ever took place or any donations were received.The same set of filings also contains allegations that Adams misled federal investigators about the location of his personal cellphone, which was seized during a raid on Gracie Mansion in September 2024.The FBI recovered multiple devices from his residence, including two iPads, a second iPhone, and an Iridium satellite phone on his nightstand.In a sworn affidavit, an FBI agent accused the mayor of “evidence of consciousness of guilt,” alleging he intentionally hid his phone and made false statements because he feared the device could reveal evidence of other crimes. Adams reportedly told his lawyer he had forgotten the phone’s passcode and provided an incorrect one.The original five-count indictment against Adams, unsealed last September, accused him of accepting over $100,000 in undisclosed gifts and luxury travel in exchange for political favours. Prosecutors also alleged he pressured the FDNY to approve permits for the Turkish consulate building in Manhattan despite safety concerns.Adams was accused of using straw donor schemes to tap into millions in matching campaign funds, reported CBS News.Though Adams has denied all wrongdoing, the case led to significant fallout. Four deputy mayors and several federal prosecutors resigned following the controversial dismissal request, which Judge Dale Ho criticised as a political bargain, citing alleged concessions over immigration policy.Ho ultimately ruled the case would not return to court, describing the DOJ’s motion to dismiss as “smacking of a bargain” and saying it wasn’t fair to let the matter hang over the mayor during an election year.Despite the scandal, Adams met with US President Trump at the White House Friday to discuss what he called “key priorities” for New York City, even as questions around his conduct continue to linger.",New York Mayor Eric Adams was accused of accepting gifts and travel in exchange for political favours.

Kash Patel cancels FBI morning meetings as he's mostly late: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kash-patel-cancels-fbi-morning-meetings-as-hes-mostly-late-report/articleshow/121041513.cms,"Kash Patel has been accused of changing decades-old schedule of FBI directors.

Badmouthing campaign against Patel



Kash Patel says he wants more budget, withdraws demand







FBI directors, for decades, have been holding a morning meeting daily at 8.30 am. But Kash Patel takes the meeting two days a week as 'sometimes he failed to arrive on time', an NBC News report said, citing officials who worked on Kash Patel's schedule. FBI spokesperson Ben Williamson denied that there was a change in the schedule because Patel was late. He said Patel still attends five morning meetings each week, including three that are smaller than the usual director's brief.FBI directors used to hold a teleconference with the leaders of the field officers on Wednesdays. Patel has discontinued that over leaking attempts but he's in close touch with the leaders.Kash Patel is facing a volley of attacks over his office timing, his trips, his frequent presence at sporting events -- of late. A former FBI official recently commented on MSNBC's Morning Joe that Patel is spotted more at nightclubs than in the office. The statement had to be retracted by MSNBC which said it did not verify the statement.Williamson said he meets Kash Patel every day in the office and hence the allegations that Patel is not in the office and working remotely from his home in Las Vegas were bogus.A friend of Patel told NBC that the only thing that Patel is doing late into the night is going to the gym.Countering allegations that Patel is not serious about the job, one FBI official told NBC that these are not even remotely true. “I myself am with him in many of these meetings. He asks tons of questions and pushes staff to get to the point and present solutions,” said the official. “To a bad-faith individual who loves to bloviate and gossip to NBC News, that might come off as lack of interest. It’s not. It’s being efficient with time and wanting to fix problems. ”Kash Patel asked for more money from the government for his agency -- $1 billion more than what the White House said.This raised speculations whether staunch Trump-supporter Patel was showing independence but a day later, he told senators that he agreed with the White House budget and will make it work.","Kash Patel is facing a volley of attacks over his office timing, his trips, his frequent presence at sporting events -- of late.

Donald Trump claims credit for brokering ceasefire as drone continue to buzz,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-claims-credit-for-brokering-ceasefire-as-drone-continue-to-buzz/articleshow/121064213.cms,"TOI correspondent from Washington:





US President Donald Trump announced a ""full and immediate ceasefire"" between India and Pakistan arising from what he claimed was ""a long night of talks mediated by the United States,"" even as drone attacks appeared to continue at the border in what is at best a sketchy truce.""Congratulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence. Thank you for your attention to this matter!"" Trump posted on social media on Saturday night after announcing a ceasefire that New Delhi alleged was violated by Pakistan almost immediately.The purported ceasefire came after parleys initiated by Secretary of State Marco Rubio , who phoned key principals in Pakistan, including its army chief Asif Munir, its President Shahbaz Sharif , and its foreign minister Ishaq Dar, asking them to stand down before reaching out to his counterparts S.Jaishankar and Ajit Doval in New Delhi to do the same.Rubio also announced that the ""Governments of India and Pakistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire and to start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site.""""We commend Prime Ministers Modi and Sharif on their wisdom, prudence, and statesmanship in choosing the path of peace,"" he added.On the ground though, the guns -- or at least the drones -- did not fall silent, with India accusing Pakistan of violating the ceasefire even as it was announced with a drone attack on Srinagar confirmed by Omar Abdullah.""This is no ceasefire. The air defence units in the middle of Srinagar just opened up,"" he posted on X, even as arguments erupted in studios and social media about which country reached out to the US first or which country the US pressed to stand down and who folded first.""Folks are going to get very hung up on whether the U.S. ""mediated"" an India-Pakistan ceasefire, or just helped bridge the gap and encourage the two to talk...I don't think it matters much. India was compelled to send a message after Pahalgam and that message was sent,"" said Jeff Smith, a Heritage Foundation analyst and an expert on the region.""Terror will not be cost-free and future terror attacks will be met with a military response. The fact the guns have gone silent for now is a good thing,"" Smith added, hewing to the broad reading among regional experts that India had set new red lines in how it would respond to terrorist attacks.Soon after the ceasefire announcement by US, India's EAM S Jaishankar maintained that New Delhi ""has consistently maintained a firm and uncompromising stance against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. It will continue to do so.""Pakistan's Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif on his part thanked President Trump ""for his leadership and proactive role for peace in the region.""""Pakistan appreciates the United States for facilitating this outcome, which we have accepted in the interest of regional peace and stability,' Sharif posted, adding that ""Pakistan believes this marks a new beginning in the resolution of issues that have plagued the region and prevented its journey toward peace, prosperity and stability.""","US President Donald Trump announced a ""full and immediate ceasefire"" between India and Pakistan arising from what he claimed was ""a long night of talks mediated by the United States"" On the ground though, the guns -- or at least the drones -- did not fall silent, with India accusing Pakistan of violating the ceasefire.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121064275,imgsize-658256,width-400,resizemode-4/121064275.jpg"

Chinese, US officials meet in Geneva to negotiate Trump tariffs





United States and China held direct trade talks in Geneva on Saturday, with discussions expected to continue on Sunday, according to an official, reported Associated Press. The meetings are part of efforts to ease tensions that have triggered steep tariff hikes and increased economic uncertainty worldwide.US treasury secretary Scott Bessent and trade representative Jamieson Greer met with Chinese vice premier He Lifeng in a closed-door session at Villa Saladin, an 18th-century mansion owned by the Swiss government. Officials from both sides confirmed that talks lasted more than ten hours. No breakthroughs were reported after Saturday’s discussions.Donald Trump’s administration has raised tariffs on Chinese goods to a combined 145%. In response, China imposed 125% tariffs on US imports.These steep tariffs are causing disruptions in industries that rely on trade between the world’s two largest economies, with companies and consumers already feeling the pinch.Trump has defended the tariffs, saying they’re necessary to address China’s unfair trade practices and reduce the US trade deficit. He also tied a 20% tariff to China’s alleged role in the fentanyl crisis. The US president recently said an 80% tariff “seems right,” leaving final decisions to Bessent.Trade experts remain sceptical about a breakthrough, but even a small agreement to scale back tariffs would be a positive step. Talks in 2020 had produced a partial deal—“Phase one”—which fell apart during the pandemic.",US treasury secretary Scott Bessent and trade representative Jamieson Greer met with Chinese vice premier He Lifeng in a closed-door session.

A Long Line of Terror Entanglements

The 2008 Mumbai attacks, which killed over 170 people, were carried out by Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), a Pakistan-based group whose handlers operated with ISI support. The trial in the US of David Headley confirmed ISI’s links to the attackers.

The 2005 London bombings had connections to individuals who trained in Pakistan’s tribal areas. British intelligence later revealed that the perpetrators had been radicalised and trained in madrassas and camps in Pakistan.

Pulwama 2019, where 40 Indian CRPF jawans were killed, was claimed by Jaish-e-Mohammed, another Pakistan-based group. Despite global pressure, Islamabad neither shut down the group’s operations nor arrested its leadership meaningfully.

Daniel Pearl’s 2002 beheading was orchestrated by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed—who was captured in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, in 2003. Again, within spitting distance of Pakistani military installations.

Abu Zubaydah, Ramzi Yousef, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed—all major al-Qaeda operatives—were captured in Pakistan, sometimes living comfortably with ISI protection, until they weren’t.

Snakes in the Backyard







Fourteen years after al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden was killed by US Navy SEALs in a covert operation in Abbottabad, the shadow of his presence still looms large over Pakistan’s security narrative. And in the latest turn of irony only Pakistan’s military establishment could serve up, the ghost of bin Laden is back—this time, through bloodlines.Read: India-Pakistan Tension - live updates At the centre of the current controversy is Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry , the suave and media-trained Director General of Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the Pakistani military’s propaganda wing. While Gen Chaudhry has become the face of Pakistan’s official messaging following the Indian military’s Operation Sindoor—a retaliatory strike that wiped out nine terror camps across Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir—the scrutiny has shifted to his father: Sultan Bashiruddin Mahmood , a nuclear scientist who once had tea and theological debates with none other than Osama bin Laden.Yes, the same bin Laden who was later found and killed in a compound just a stone’s throw from the Pakistan Military Academy, raising serious questions about how such a high-value target could hide in plain sight.Sultan Bashiruddin Mahmood was not just any nuclear scientist. He played key roles in Pakistan’s Kahuta Enrichment Plant and Chashma Nuclear Project. After retiring, he founded an organisation called Ummah Tameer-e-Nau (UTN), which, among other things, proposed—earnestly—using djinns to produce electricity.Somewhere along this delusional path, he also met with bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri in Afghanistan months before 9/11.US intelligence agencies were alarmed by the possibility that a Pakistani nuclear scientist had direct access to al-Qaeda leadership. Mahmood was picked up, questioned, and later released. But the damage was done: he was placed on Pakistan’s Exit Control List and became a symbol of how porous the walls are between Pakistan’s scientific, military, and extremist circles.Now, his son—Lt Gen Chaudhry—is spearheading Pakistan’s information warfare while claiming victimhood. As AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi put it: “Osama bin Laden was found taking shelter in a military area of Pakistan. It is for the Western world to realise that Pakistan is a failed state... their nuclear bombs must be disarmed.”The bin Laden saga is just one chapter in a thick volume of accusations:Even today, Pakistan’s Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) remain breeding grounds for Taliban offshoots, al-Qaeda remnants, and more recently, Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which has carried out multiple attacks within Pakistan itself.In fact, Pakistan’s ministers even had foot-in-mouth moments where they admitted their links to terror. Pakistan’s Defence Minister Khawaja Asif told Sky News that the country had been “doing the US’s dirty work” by nurturing terror groups for decades. Former Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari echoed similar sentiments, framing Pakistan’s past as an open secret. These statements effectively confirmed what the world suspected all along: Pakistan wasn’t just a victim of terror—it was a sponsor.The current Army Chief, General Asim Munir, represents a more ideological and Islamist version of military dominance. His speech days before the deadly April 2025 Pahalgam terror attack invoked the two-nation theory and renewed Pakistan’s claims over Kashmir, stoking tensions that quickly escalated into bloodshed.The West’s long complicity in ignoring Pakistan’s terror links has come full circle. The snakes—once kept in the backyard—now roam openly. The question no longer is if Pakistan supports terrorism, but what the global community intends to do with this long-delayed truth.","Sultan Bashiruddin Mahmood was a nuclear scientist who once had tea and theological debates with Osama bin Laden.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday called a meeting of National Command Authority after India targeted at least four Pakistan air bases in response to Pakistan’s recent cross-border drone and missile attacks that targeted multiple Indian military and civilian locations.National Command Authority is Pakistan’s highest security decision-making body, comprising senior civilian and military leaders. It oversees key national security matters, including the country’s nuclear weapons policy and strategic planning.However, Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif, later said that no such meeting was held.""This thing that you have spoken about (nuclear option) is present, but let's not talk about it - we should treat it as a very distant possibility, we shouldn't even discuss it in the immediate context,"" Asif told ARY TV.""Before we get to that point, I think temperatures will come down. No meeting has happened of the National Command Authority, nor is any such meeting scheduled,"" he added.This comes after India destroyed key Pakistani posts and terrorist launch pads near Jammu, which were being used to launch tube-launched drones, news agency ANI reported citing sources.Earlier in the morning, multiple explosions were reported across several locations in Pakistan, indicating possible Indian punitive action in response to recent cross-border escalations.According to Pakistani claims, three of its air bases were targeted: Nur Khan Air Base in Rawalpindi, Murid Air Base in Chakwal, and Rafiqui Air Base in Jhang district of eastern Punjab province.The Indian retaliatory strikes come after a series of provocations from Pakistan, including a major drone offensive on strike, when 26 locations—from Jammu and Kashmir to Gujarat—were targeted using armed drones. Defence sources confirmed that Indian forces successfully thwarted these attacks, which were aimed at key infrastructure such as airports and air bases, for a second consecutive night.On Thursday night, Indian defence systems also intercepted and neutralized drones and missiles launched in an attempt to strike military installations in 15 northern and western Indian cities.The latest actions are part of a broader Indian military response under Operation Sindoor, which began on Wednesday.As part of that operation, Indian armed forces carried out precise missile strikes on nine terror targets in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) and Pakistan. The operation was launched in retaliation for the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, which claimed the lives of 26 innocent civilians.","Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called a meeting of National Command Authority.

NEW DELHI: Amid its widening hostilities with India, Pakistan army came under a sensational attack in South Waziristan, resulting in the death of 20 security personnel. Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) claimed responsibility for the attack.Two more Pakistani soldiers were killed in a clash with Baloch insurgents The attack by TTP took place on Thursday night on Pakistan military's Dawngate outpost in Shakai sub-division of South Waziristan, sources said. TTP claimed it was a multi-phase operation, initially killing six soldiers using laser-aided rifles after which a military convoy sent to support the besieged outpost was ambushed.According to the group, 20 security personnel were killed and five wounded.TTP accused Pakistan army of leaking coordinates of Jaish-e-Mohammed's Bahawalpur Markaz, which was targeted in an Indian air strike that killed 14, including 10 family members of JeM chief Masood Azhar. TTP spokesman Md Khorasani expressed grief over the incident, criticising Pakistan army as a ""traitorous and pro-Western"" group that provided the information leading to the attack.Khorasani described Pakistan army as a ""professional killer group"" that served foreign interests at the expense of its own people.He accused Pakistan army of ""handing over mujahideen to infidels"", a reference to Osama bin Laden's killing in Abbotabad.On Friday evening, Baloch Freedom fighters launched coordinated attacks across various regions of Balochistan, targeting Pakistani forces and infrastructure. The attacks occurred in multiple locations, including Turbat, where a grenade attack targeted Pakistani forces in D Baloch area, and Quetta, where two grenade attacks hit Pakistani army posts in Hazarganji and Faizabad areas.The fresh attacks came two days after Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) targeted Pakistani military vehicle in Bolan. An IED blast killed at least eight soldiers, including a special operations commander. Six were critically injured. A week prior, 10 Pakistan army personnel were killed in an IED attack by BLA in Quetta.Pakistan is under mounting pressure as TTP and BLA have intensified their attacks.

Poll Do you agree with the decision to abolish the controversial provisions of the cyber security act-2023? Yes, it's a positive change. No, I disagree with the decision.





DHAKA : The interim govt, headed by Muhammad Yunus , is set to finalise an ordinance within a week that will abolish nine controversial provisions of the cyber security act-2023, including one related to the liberation war and father of the nation, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman One of the provisions abolished during the drafting of the new ordinance is punishment for carrying out any “hateful, misleading or defamatory propaganda” against the liberation war, the spirit of the liberation war, Mujibur Rahman, the national anthem, or the national flag.” Law adviser Asif Nazrul said this provision had often been misused in the past to “harass” people.At a meeting held Tuesday, the council of advisers approved the draft of the new ordinance, titled ‘Cyber Surokkha Adhyadesh-2025 (cyber protection ordinance-2025), fulfilling the interim govt’s promise to repeal the cyber security act-2023.Once vetted by the law ministry, the ordinance is expected to be formally gazetted and enforced within a week.Nazrul said the nine abolished provisions had accounted for 95 per cent of all cases previously filed under the 2023 act.These cases will be automatically cancelled once the new ordinance comes into effect. “When we first took office, we pledged to repeal the previous cyber security act and replace it with amodern law,” he said.For the first time, internet access will be officially recognized as a civil right in Bangladesh. The ordinance also clearly defines and criminalises online sexual harassment and the abuse of women and children. Apart from targeted abuse and hate speech, the ordinance removes provisions that penalise general opinions or speech.","The interim govt is set to finalise an ordinance within a week that will abolish nine controversial provisions of the cyber security act-2023.
