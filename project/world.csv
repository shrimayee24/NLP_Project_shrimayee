High drama in Tamil Nadu assembly: Governor R N Ravi walks out; alleges 'national anthem insulted',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/national-anthem-again-insulted-tamil-nadu-governor-r-n-ravi-walks-out-of-assembly-skips-customary-address/articleshow/126757117.cms,"Tamil Nadu governor RN Ravi (IANS photo)

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu governor RN Ravi walked out of the state assembly on Tuesday before delivering his inaugural address, expressing disappointment over what he said was a lack of respect for the National Anthem . He also claimed that his microphone was switched off during the proceedings.“I am disappointed. National Anthem was not given due respect,” the governor said. He added that “it is unfortunate that his speech was interrupted.”Inside the House, the situation led to a sharp exchange, with assembly Speaker M Appavu urging the governor to follow established rules and customs of the assembly.Later, Raj Bhavan issued a press release explaining the reasons behind the governor’s walkout. “The governor’s mic was repeatedly switched off, and he was not allowed to speak,” the statement said. It also claimed that issues such as “atrocities against Dalits and sexual violence against Dalit women are sharply increasing,” but were “totally bypassed in the speech.”The release further alleged that the “National Anthem is yet again insulted, and the Fundamental Constitutional Duty is disregarded.”This was not the first such incident. A similar episode took place last year when governor Ravi walked out of the Assembly in what he described as “deep anguish,” alleging that the “constitution of Bharat” and the National Anthem were insulted.With Assembly elections drawing closer, the session is being viewed as politically crucial. Opposition parties, including the AIADMK and the BJP, are expected to level several allegations against the ruling party and the state government.Chief minister M K Stalin and his Cabinet colleagues are preparing to counter the attacks, setting the stage for a tense and politically charged assembly session.",Tamil Nadu governor RN Ravi walked out of the state assembly on Tuesday before delivering his inaugural address.

FIR In July 2023, Suspects Not Even Identified Yet







IMPHAL: A 20-year-old from the Kuki-Zo community, who became the unseen face of mob-fuelled sexual violence during the May 2023 ethnic rioting in Manipur, has died waiting for justice.Eighteen when she was abducted and allegedly ""handed over"" to members of an armed group, the woman carried physical and psychological injuries that never healed, culminating in her death on Jan 10, the Indigenous Tribal Leaders Forum said.The FIR, filed two-and-a-half years ago, is still pending at Porompat police station in Imphal East. None among her alleged attackers has been even identified.Kuki-Zo organisations, including Committee on Tribal Unity, held a candlelight vigil Saturday, demanding accountability for the woman's trauma through the 30-odd months she lived since the assault. She first reported the alleged crime to Kangpokpi police on July 21, 2023, two months after it occurred.This was after she fled the Imphal Valley amid spiralling unrest there. The FIR states that she was abducted on May 15 that year from near an ATM booth in Imphal's New Checkon. Some women from a group involved in the ethnic clashes allowed four armed men belonging to a valley-based outfit to take her to a hilltop, where three of them allegedly took turns sexually brutalising her before dumping her in a creek.The woman survived when an autorickshaw driver ferrying vegetables found her. The next day, she fled Imphal and sought treatment at a Kangpokpi hospital. She was referred to a hospital at Kohima in Nagaland and later to Guwahati in Assam.Despite months of medical care, the woman continued to suffer from uterine complications and deep psychological trauma, ITLF said. The organisation termed her death ""emblematic"" of the atrocities faced by the community during the ethnic violence.The Committee on Tribal Unity urged the Union govt to ensure justice was done to the young woman, saying punishing the perpetrators would ""uphold the spirit of the PM's Beti Bachao vision"".","20-year-old from Kuki-Zo community became the unseen face of mob-fuelled sexual violence during the May 2023 ethnic rioting in Manipur.

If Sikorski, who is also deputy prime minister, thought he could duck the issue by pretending Jaishankar might have been talking about Trump tariffs, the Indian minister retorted that the selective targeting was not limited to tariffs.""I think there have been other forms of selective targeting.

He and two others were airlifted to hospital, but Singh did not survive, officials said. The Army’s White Knight Corps confirmed the death on X.The clash began after troops moved toward suspected hideouts and came under grenade attacks followed by bursts of AK-47 fire in darkness, according to officials. The operation, codenamed Trashi-I, was launched on intelligence indicating terrorist presence in the rugged, wooded hills.On Monday, forces tightened the cordon and expanded searches, reinforcing units in the forested zone.

He said he had first raised the demand way back in 2010, when he was a minister in then Congress govt.Senior Congress member Lal Singh on Jan 8 backed the demand, arguing that smaller states improve governance and development. “Ladakh was made a separate entity and it did not affect anything. The only issue is that there should not be any break from the country,” he said.Peoples Conference leader Sajad Lone was the first Valley-based leader to react on the “divide” between the two regions. Referring to demands raised for shifting of the proposed National Law University from Budgam to Jammu, Lone on Jan 14 said: “Maybe the time has come for an amicable divorce.

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump has invited India to be part of a proposed international “Board of Peace” aimed at overseeing post-war governance and reconstruction in Gaza. The initiative forms a key pillar of Trump’s broader Gaza ceasefire plan and is now beginning to take shape, with the White House confirming the involvement of several global figures.In a letter, shared by US Ambassador to India Sergio Gor, Trump framed the initiative as part of a sweeping 20-point “Comprehensive Plan” to end the Gaza conflict, first announced in September last year. He said the plan had since received wide backing from global leaders across the Arab world, Israel and Europe, and was formally endorsed by the United Nations Security Council through Resolution 2803 in November.Trump wrote that the moment had come to “turn dreams into reality”, with the centrepiece of the initiative being the creation of an international “Board of Peace”. The body, Trump said, would be established as a new international organisation and transitional governing administration, tasked with delivering what he called “lasting peace” through governance reform, reconstruction and economic investment.""Now it is time to turn all of these Dreams into reality. At the heart of the Plan is The Board of Peace, the most impressive and consequential Board ever assembled, which will be established as a new International Organization and Transitional Governing Administration,"" the letter read.The invitation places India among a growing list of countries and global figures being courted by Washington as Trump seeks to operationalise a 20-point “Comprehensive Plan” aimed at ending the Gaza conflict and managing the transition to long-term stability.According to the White House, the Board of Peace will serve as the central strategic body overseeing Gaza’s post-war transition. Chaired by Trump himself, it is expected to focus on governance capacity-building, regional relations, reconstruction, investment mobilisation and large-scale funding.Confirmed members include US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump’s special negotiator Steve Witkoff, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, former UK prime minister Tony Blair, billionaire financier Marc Rowan, World Bank president Ajay Banga and senior National Security Council aide Robert Gabriel. More appointments are expected in the coming weeks.Alongside the main board, two additional structures have been announced. The National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), led by Palestinian technocrat Dr Ali Sha’ath, will oversee the restoration of public services, rebuilding of civil institutions and stabilisation of daily life in Gaza. The White House has described this as a key step in implementing Phase Two of Trump’s plan.A separate Gaza Executive Board will support governance delivery on the ground and includes international diplomats and regional figures from Turkey, Qatar, Egypt, Israel and the UAE, as well as UN humanitarian coordinator Sigrid Kaag.Apart from India several countries including Argentina, Canada, Egypt, Turkey, Albania and Cyprus have been invited. Pakistan has also been invited to join the Board of Peace. Pakistan's foreign office spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said that the prime minister received the invitation, adding that Pakistan will continue supporting international efforts for peace and security in Gaza.As per a report by Bloomberg, a draft charter proposes of the Trump-led “Board of Peace,” allegedly requires nations to contribute $1 billion to secure long-term membership. The draft gives Trump authority over membership, renewals, and final approval of decisions.","US President Donald Trump has invited India to be part of a proposed international “Board of Peace” The Board of Peace will serve as the central strategic body overseeing Gaza’s post-war transition.

OpenAI’s ChatGPT accused of murder-suicide



Elon Musk sends ‘open warning’ to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman







Tesla CEO Elon Musk has sharply criticised OpenAI’s chatbot ChatGPT, calling it the ‘devil’. The comment made by Musk comes after reports surfaced that the popular chatbot allegedly convinced a man to kill his mother and himself. Responding to a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Musk wrote, “This is diabolical. OpenAI’s ChatGPT convinced a guy to do a murder-suicide! To be safe, AI must be maximally truthful-seeking and not pander to delusions.”According to a lawsuit filed in the US, a 56-year old man is claimed to have been influenced by ChatGPT into committing a murder-suicide. The case alleges that the AI chatbot manipulated the individual during conversations, ultimately leading to the tragic incident.The family has filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, after an elderly woman was killed in her Connecticut home last year. The lawsuit alleges that OpenAI’s chatbot ChatGPT helped in feeling the decisions which lead to the murder and suicide. Suzanne Eberson Adams, 83, was killed in her Greenwich home in last August. Police said that her 56-year old son Stein-Erik Soelberg murdered her before committing suicide.As per the lawsuit, Stein-Erik obsessively used ChatGPT for at least five months before the killings, sometimes for hours a day.His son claims the chatbot reinforced paranoid beliefs that his mother was trying to kill him.Recently, Elon Musk sent an ‘open warning’ to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. In a post shared on X, Musk said that he “can’t wait to start trial”, anticipating dramatic revelations from discovery and testimony in his ongoing lawsuit against the ChatGPT-maker. The tech billionaire was responding to an X post which said that there are 57% chance Elon Musk may win the case against OpenAI. “New court documents reveal OpenAI’s president admitted he wanted to turn OpenAI into ‘for profit’,"" the post added.Replying to it, Elon Musk wrote: “Can’t wait to start the trial. The discovery and testimony will blow your mind.”Musk, who is one of the co-founders of OpenAI, has filed a lawsuit against the company and CEO Sam Altman alleging the AI company defrauded him by diverting from its non-profit roots.","Elon Musk has sharply criticised OpenAI’s chatbot ChatGPT, calling it the ‘devil’ The comment comes after reports surfaced that the popular chatbot allegedly convinced a man to kill his mother and himself.

'Make America go away': MAGA has a new meaning in Greenland; how protesters are mocking Trump through caps,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/make-america-go-away-maga-has-a-new-meaning-in-greenland-how-protesters-are-mocking-trump-through-caps/articleshow/126755105.cms,"Picture from X

Trump’s Greenland 'Military Takeover’ Ignites MAGA? Johnson Says 'Not Appropriate' As NATO Panics





Has MAGA found a new meaning? Protesters in Denmark have taken to the streets to oppose US President Donald Trump ’s rigid push to acquire the Arctic island -- Greenland, wearing red baseball caps spoofing his iconic MAGA hats -- this time emblazoned with the slogan “Make America Go Away.”MAGA hats have become symbolic of Danish and Greenlandic defiance against the US president’s threat to seize the Arctic territory.The caps reading “Make America Go Away,” a parody of Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan, have gained popularity on social media and at public protests, including a weekend demonstration in freezing weather in the Danish capital.Several European countries have also joined Denmark and Greenland in pushing back against Donald Trump, stressing the need to defend the Arctic and warning that threats to Greenland undermine Western security.Protesters, however, have been far more blunt.“I want to show my support to Greenland and also show that I don’t like the president of the United States,” ABC news quoted a 76-year-old Copenhagen resident Lars Hermansen, who wore one of the red caps at a protest on Saturday.The mock hats were created by Jesper Rabe Tonnesen, a vintage clothing store owner in Copenhagen. At first, the idea failed, with early batches last year drawing little interest.That changed after the Trump administration recently stepped up its rhetoric over Greenland. Since then, the caps have appeared widely at protests and online.“When a delegation from America went up to Greenland, we started to realize this probably wasn’t a joke -- it’s not reality TV, it’s actually reality,” said Tonnesen, 58. “So I said, OK, what can I do? Can I communicate in a funny way with a good message and unite the Danes to show that Danish people support the people of Greenland?”Demand quickly jumped from almost nothing to selling out within a single weekend. Tonnesen said he has now ordered “several thousand” more.The first version of the cap designed by Tonnesen carried a wordplay slogan, “Nu det NUUK!” a twist on the Danish phrase “Nu det nok,” meaning “Now it’s enough,” replacing the word with Nuuk, Greenland’s small capital.At Saturday’s rally, protesters waved red-and-white Danish and Greenlandic flags and held handmade signs mocking US claims over the territory, which is slightly larger than Saudi Arabia","Protesters in Denmark have taken to the streets to oppose US President Donald Trump’s push to acquire Greenland.

Iran Broadcast Breached: State TV Hacked As Opposition Airs Reza Pahlavi Protest Message Nationwide

State TV satellite broadcast disrupted

Crackdown death toll rises sharply

Fears of executions and a police ultimatum

International backlash and Davos snub

US aircraft carrier movement raises tensions





Iran is facing one of its gravest crises in decades as nationwide protests, a deadly crackdown by authorities, cyber disruptions to state television and rising international pressure converge amid an ongoing internet shutdown.Activists say the death toll from the unrest has crossed 4,000, while tensions between Tehran and Washington remain elevated.Hackers disrupted Iranian state television satellite transmissions, briefly airing footage supporting exiled crown prince Reza Pahlavi and urging security forces not to “point your weapons at the people,” online videos showed early Monday, as per news agency AP.The footage appeared across multiple satellite-broadcast channels of the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting and included clips of security personnel, claiming some had laid down their weapons.The semiofficial Fars news agency acknowledged the signal disruption in “some areas of the country,” but did not specify what was broadcast.Pahlavi’s office confirmed the appearance of the footage but did not comment on the hacking.The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency said at least 4,029 people have been killed in the crackdown on protests, with fears the toll could rise further as information emerges despite the internet shutdown, according to AP.Of those killed, 3,786 were demonstrators, 180 security personnel, 28 children and 35 non-protesters. The agency also said more than 26,000 people have been arrested.Iranian officials have not released an official death toll. Earlier, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the protests had left “several thousand” people dead and blamed the United States.Concerns have grown over possible executions of detainees. Iran’s top police officer Ahmad-Reza Radan issued an ultimatum to protesters deemed “deceived,” asking them to surrender within three days for leniency or face severe punishment, reported news agency AFP.A joint statement from Iran’s president, judiciary chief and parliament speaker said that while “killers and seditious terrorists will be punished,” leniency would be shown to those misled into participating.Iran’s foreign minister Abbas Araghchi had his invitation to speak at the World Economic Forum in Davos withdrawn due to the killings. “It is not right for the Iranian government to be represented at Davos this year,” the forum said, as per AP.Araghchi denounced the move, alleging political pressure. The Munich Security Conference also withdrew invitations for Iranian officials.Amid rising tensions, ship-tracking data analysed by AP showed the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier entering the Strait of Malacca, potentially en route to the Middle East.The USS Abraham Lincoln was stationed in the South China Sea with its strike group to deter China amid rising tensions with Taiwan.Now, the tracking data shows that the USS Frank E Petersen Jr, USS Michael Murphy, and USS Spruance, all guided missile destroyers, are accompanying the Lincoln through the strait.Multiple US media reports from anonymous officials say the Lincoln, which is based in San Diego, is heading to the Middle East. It will take several days before its aircraft are within range of that region.Currently, the Middle East does not have an aircraft carrier group or an amphibious ready group, which complicates any talks about a military operation against Iran, especially since Gulf Arab states generally oppose such an attack.Earlier, US President Donald Trump warned Tehran against killing peaceful protesters or carrying out mass executions following the unrest. However, he thanked the Iranian authorities recently for cancelling the hangings of the protestors.Iran remains under heavy security, with limited internet access, as authorities struggle to contain the fallout from the deadliest unrest the country has seen in decades.","Activists say the death toll from the unrest has crossed 4,000, while tensions between Tehran and Washington remain elevated.

MUMBAI: Newly elected BJP corporators have been directed not to leave Mumbai for the next eight to ten days in view of the upcoming mayoral reservation process and other developments linked to the formation of the municipal corporation, a party leader said on Monday.The Maharashtra government has initiated the process for the election of mayors in Mumbai and 28 other civic bodies. The lottery to determine reservation for the mayoral posts is scheduled for January 22 and will be conducted at the state secretariat, as per an order issued by the Urban Development Department, according to news agency PTI.In Maharashtra, mayors are elected by corporators, with the post reserved on a rotational basis.According to the BJP leader, newly elected corporators have been asked to stay in the city as the process of constituting the municipal corporation could take over a week. “Key political developments are expected once the mayoral reservation is announced,” the leader said.Under the prescribed procedure, the municipal commissioner must first publish a gazette notification listing the elected representatives.This is followed by the registration of each political party’s elected group with the Konkan revenue division commissioner.The BJP has emerged as the single largest party in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), securing 89 of the 227 seats in the January 15 elections.Meanwhile, sources said the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena is likely to formally constitute its group in the civic body on Tuesday.","The Maharashtra government has initiated the process for the election of mayors in Mumbai and 28 other civic bodies.

World Economic Forum BARS Iran FM’s Davos Entry After Khamenei Regime’s Deadly Crackdown On Protests





Iran’s foreign minister will skip this week’s World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, with organisers saying on Monday that his presence would be inappropriate in the wake of Iran’s recent deadly crackdown on protesters.Abbas Araghchi had been listed as a speaker for Tuesday at the annual gathering of political and business leaders in the Swiss ski resort. However, pressure mounted on organisers after rights activists urged them to withdraw the invitation, citing what they described as a “massacre” of civilians inside Iran.Confirming the decision on X, the World Economic Forum said: “The Iranian Foreign Minister will not be attending Davos.” It added: “Although he was invited last fall, the tragic loss of lives of civilians in Iran over the past few weeks means that it is not right for the Iranian government to be represented at Davos this year.”Iran has been gripped by unrest since late December, when demonstrations driven by economic grievances spread rapidly across the country. The protests were widely viewed as one of the most serious challenges faced by the Iranian leadership in recent years.Authorities responded with a sweeping crackdown, accompanied by a communications blackout that began on January 8. The protests have since largely subsided.Norway-based Iran Human Rights said it has verified the deaths of 3,428 protesters allegedly killed by security forces. According to the group, the figures are based on information from Iran’s health and medical system, eyewitnesses and other independent sources.The organisation cautioned that the actual death toll is likely to be significantly higher. The numbers cannot be independently verified by media outlets, and Iranian officials have not released an official casualty figure.","Abbas Araghchi had been listed as a speaker for Tuesday at the annual gathering of political and business leaders in the Swiss ski resort.

Parts of Russia’s Far Eastern Kamchatka Peninsula are reeling under extreme and record-breaking snowfall, with powerful winter storms dumping several metres of snow and bringing daily life to a near standstill.Footage has emerged showing heavy snowfall in Russia that lasted for four days without interruption, blanketing residential areas, roads and buildings.In Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, the capital of Kamchatka Krai, road conditions remain “critical” after a series of storms battered the region with snow, ice and strong winds, reported The Moscow Times.Meteorologists said the level of snowfall recorded since early January has not been seen in more than 50 years. As per The Moscow Times, the average snow height in the city has reached around 170 cm, with drifts exceeding 2.5 metres in some neighbourhoods.In some areas, drifts have risen several metres high, blocking building entrances and burying cars almost completely.People were seen digging out their cars after a powerful snowstorm dumped several feet of snow across parts of Russia’s Kamchatka Peninsula, as visuals showed locals carving paths through towering snowbanks.Russian children were also seen enjoying the unusual conditions, sliding on snow piled up near multistorey buildings, while residents in some areas had fun snow-gliding and diving into massive drifts.The current record-breaking snowfall in Russia’s Kamchatka Peninsula has seen drifts reach up to five metres (16 feet).City authorities declared a state of emergency after at least two elderly men were killed by snow falling from rooftops last week, as per The Moscow Times.Officials warned that icicles and heavy snow accumulation on roofs continue to pose serious risks, while prolonged snowfall has also raised avalanche concerns in residential areas.According to Reuters, Kamchatka has witnessed its heaviest snowfall in around 60 years, disrupting transport and forcing residents to adapt to extraordinary conditions.Life in the region remains severely affected as authorities race to clear roads and restore normal movement.","Parts of Russia’s Far Eastern Kamchatka Peninsula are reeling under extreme and record-breaking snowfall.

'Trump Still A Friend': Netanyahu Publicly Opposes U.S. Board Of Peace For Gaza Governance





Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday issued a stern warning to Iran’s Khamenei-led regime, vowing an “unprecedented” response if Tehran attacks Israel, Xinhua reported.Addressing the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, Netanyahu said, “If it makes a mistake and attacks us, we will act with a force it has not yet known.”He said Israel was “closely” monitoring Iran, cautioning that “no one can predict what the future holds for Iran, but it will not return to what it once was,” a remark suggesting irreversible consequences for Tehran in the event of a conflict.The comments came as the United States was reportedly moving the nuclear-powered USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group toward the Middle East amid escalating tensions with Iran.Separately, Netanyahu addressed US-led proposals for Gaza’s post-war governance, under which Turkish and Qatari officials have been cited as potential participants in the US President Donald Trump-chaired “Board of Peace.”“We have a certain disagreement with our friends in the United States over the composition of the advisory board that will accompany the processes in Gaza,” Netanyahu said, adding that neither Turkish nor Qatari soldiers would be permitted to operate in the enclave.Israel has consistently opposed any Turkish role in Gaza and maintains uneasy ties with Qatar, despite Turkey and Qatar being among the key mediators between Israel and Hamas.","'If it makes a mistake and attacks us, we will act with a force it has not yet known,' Netanyahu says.

'No Mercy, Executions Coming': Iran Shocks Trump With Big Declaration Against RIOTERS & CRIMINALS

Top developments from the Iran unrest

Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian warned any US strike would draw a “harsh and regrettable” response and called an attack on the Supreme Leader “all-out war”.

In a video message to Iranians on X, Reza Pahlavi, the exiled crown prince of Iran, said: “The battle in Iran today is between occupation and liberation. The Iranian people have called for me to lead. I will return to Iran.”

A regional Iranian official told Reuters at least 5,000 people, including around 500 security personnel, were killed; Kurdish regions saw the deadliest clashes.

Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei acknowledged “several thousand” deaths in a televised address, blaming the United States and foreign-backed “rioters”.

Human rights groups report thousands of arrests during the crackdown.

Iran’s judiciary said detained protesters face charges of Mohareb (waging war against God), a capital offence under Iranian law.

US President Donald Trump called for “new leadership” in Iran and accused Khamenei of using unprecedented violence.

Trump claimed Tehran halted planned executions of 800 detainees and thanked Iranian authorities in a social media post.

Iran accused the US and Israel of orchestrating unrest; Pezeshkian repeated the allegation in a call with Russia’s Vladimir Putin.

NetBlocks said internet access briefly returned after 238 hours of shutdown on Sunday but was reportedly cut again on Monday after a limited, heavily filtered restoration of Google and messaging services.

Streets in Tehran and other cities reportedly returned to an uneasy calm on Sunday, with shops reopened and no fresh protests reported by state media.

(With inputs from agencies)





Iran’s state television channels were briefly hijacked on Sunday after anti-regime activists hacked Iran's Badr satellite, broadcasting opposition messaging and protest footage across multiple networks, The Times of Israel reported.Exiled crown prince Reza Pahlavi appeared in the unauthorised segments urging Iranians to join demonstrations and calling on security forces to side with protesters. Iran-focused outlet Iran International first reported the disruption, while Israeli media said the breach involved the Badr satellite platform. Clips were later circulated by Pahlavi’s media team.According to the Jerusalem Post, the hijacked broadcast in the video also showed messages urging demonstrators to persist, interspersed with footage of solidarity rallies held across global cities and clips highlighting statements of support from international leaders.The broadcast hack comes amid weeks of unrest that began on December 28 over economic hardship and escalated into nationwide anti-government protests, followed by a sweeping crackdown, mass arrests and severe internet restrictions. A US-based rights group says it has verified thousands of deaths and arrests during the violent crackdown. Iranian authorities have blamed foreign adversaries for fuelling the unrest, while US President Donald Trump has publicly condemned Tehran’s response and warned of consequences if violence continues.","Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian warned any US strike would draw a “harsh and regrettable” response.

At least 21 people were killed when a high-speed train derailed and collided with another train late Sunday in southern Spain.The regional emergency agency in Andalucía confirmed the death toll, while regional government president Juanma Moreno said the number of victims was expected to rise.The cause of the derailment was not immediately clear, with transport minister Óscar Puente describing the crash as “extremely strange” as it occurred on a straight section of track.The crash occurred in the early evening, with hundreds of survivors rescued amid darkness at the scene.Salvador Jimenez, a journalist with Spanish broadcaster RTVE who was travelling on one of the trains, said that “there was a moment when it felt like an earthquake and the train had indeed derailed,"" as cited by AP.He said passengers broke windows using emergency hammers, with some escaping without serious injuries. Footage shared from the scene showed people climbing out through windows as they fled the wreckage, with carriages tilted at sharp angles.The crash occurred at around 7.45 pm (local time) in Adamuz, in the southern province of Córdoba, Puente said.He said the rear carriages of the first train derailed and crossed onto the opposite track, where they struck another passing train, causing the front two carriages of the second service to also leave the rails.The first train was travelling from Málaga to Madrid and was privately operated, while the second, run by Spain’s national rail company, was bound for the southern city of Huelva, west of Seville.The Andalucía regional government set up an advanced medical post at the site to treat the injured, while the national rail operator and railway company assisted relatives of victims at stations in Madrid, Seville, Córdoba, Málaga and Huelva.Paco Carmona, the head of Córdoba’s fire brigade, which is coordinating the rescue operation, told public television that emergency crews were prioritising efforts to reach victims still trapped in the two carriages most severely damaged in the crash, as cited by the New York Times.Spain’s state-owned rail infrastructure agency said rail traffic between Madrid and key southern Andalusian cities, including Córdoba, Seville, Málaga and Huelva, will be suspended on Monday.According to the International union of railways, Spain has the world’s second-longest high-speed rail network, behind China.","A high-speed train derailed and collided with another train in southern Spain.

Trump Posts From Truth Social (@TrumpDailyPosts) January 15, 2026





President Donald Trump’s proposed “Board of Peace” is being positioned as a new international peacekeeping body, with member countries invited to extend their participation beyond an initial three-year term by contributing more than $1 billion within the board’s first year.According to a draft charter reviewed by The New York Times, the board was originally conceived as part of Trump’s plan to oversee post-war administration in the Gaza Strip, the draft charter makes no mention of Gaza.The omission has fueled speculation that the body could be given a far broader mandate, potentially covering multiple global conflicts and even serving as a US-led alternative to the United Nations Security Council.A UN Security Council resolution adopted in November 2025 had endorsed Trump’s proposal to end the war in Gaza and welcomed the creation of the board as a transitional authority to set the framework and coordinate funding for Gaza’s redevelopment. However, the charter appears to outline a significantly more expansive role than that described in Trump’s Gaza plan published in October 2025 or in the subsequent Security Council resolution.The draft charter was circulated with invitations to prospective members over the weekend. An official, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the diplomacy involved, confirmed the document’s authenticity. Bloomberg had earlier reported the $1 billion buy-in requirement.On Friday, the White House announced that the board’s initial members would include secretary of state Marco Rubio, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, and World Bank President Ajay Banga. Other people included in the executive board are US special envoy Steve Witkoff, former UK PM Tony Blair, billionnare Marc Rowan and US national security advisor Robert Gabriel.- Canada- Turkey- Egypt- Paraguay- Argentina- Albania- India- Jordan- Greece- Cyprus- Pakistan- Hungary-Russian President Vladimir Putin- Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama- Argentine President Javier Milei- Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva- Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney- Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides- Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi- Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban- Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni- Jordanian King Abdullah II- Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif- Paraguayan President Santiago Pena- Romanian President Nicusor Dan- Turkish President Recep Tayyip ErdoganTrump, who is set to chair the board, described it on Truth Social last week as “the Greatest and Most Prestigious Board ever assembled at any time, any place,” though many details about its structure and operations remain unclear.According to the charter, the board’s mission is to “promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict,” and to carry out peace-building functions in line with international law.The document states that the board is expected to meet for votes at least once a year, with its expenses funded through voluntary contributions from member states and other sources.","President Donald Trump’s proposed “Board of Peace” is being positioned as a new international peacekeeping body.

— Mel (@Villgecrazylady) January 18, 2026 A casual lunch turned into a frightening ordeal for five software engineers in Minneapolis last week after they were mistakenly labelled as federal immigration agents and confronted by an angry crowd outside the restaurant where they were dining. The incident, which took place at Clancy’s Deli near 38th Street and Grand Avenue South, highlights the heightened tensions over Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity in the Twin Cities as protests and community unrest escalate.According to accounts obtained by Alpha News, the group of software engineers, all white males dressed casually, were quietly eating lunch when one of the men received a message on an anti-ICE Signal chat group claiming that plainclothes ICE agents were inside the restaurant.

In this climate, misinformation and real-time alerts from activist networks can spark rapid, sometimes volatile public responses, as seen in the Clancy’s Deli episode. Anti-ICE protester groups have been mobilising quickly via encrypted messaging apps to track and confront perceived federal agents but incidents like this highlight the risk of misidentification and escalation when tensions run high.

The software engineers involved described mixed political views within their group, with some identifying as anti-ICE and others as neutral or supportive of immigration enforcement, underscoring the unpredictable consequences of such confrontations. Lee said the incident has forced some in the group to rethink their positions amid the volatile local climate.

What comes next

As Minneapolis grapples with ongoing protests, federal enforcement actions and community divisions, this episode serves as a stark reminder of how quickly everyday situations can spiral into dangerous confrontations. Local authorities have been balancing enforcement with public safety protocols, including a recent federal court ruling limiting the arrest powers of DHS agents against peaceful protesters, underscoring both legal and social complexities in the region.

What began as a quiet lunch for a group of tech workers has become another headline in a city struggling with deep divisions over immigration policies, law enforcement presence and citizen activism. Whether viewed as a cautionary tale about misinformation or a symptom of escalating public distrust in federal agencies, the incident has captured public attention and sparked debate over protest tactics, civil liberties and community safety.





The incident is not isolated; it comes amid a broader wave of anti-ICE activism and backlash in Minneapolis triggered by increased federal immigration enforcement. Earlier this month, the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an ICE agent during an enforcement operation drew national attention, intensifying community anger and protest activity throughout the city.Social media reaction to the incident was swift and sharply divided, with the story igniting fierce debate across X (formerly Twitter), Reddit and conservative and progressive forums alike. Critics of the protesters described the confrontation as a chilling example of “mob justice”, warning that viral Signal alerts and online callouts are increasingly putting ordinary civilians at risk based on assumptions alone.Many users expressed alarm at how quickly a false accusation escalated into public harassment, with some calling it a failure of crowd restraint and accountability in activist spaces. On the other side, some anti-ICE voices argued that heightened vigilance was a byproduct of aggressive immigration enforcement and mistrust of authorities, though even among them, several conceded that misidentification and intimidation crossed a line.While one X user commented, ""Five random White guys eating lunch in Minnesota get reported as “undercover ICE agents” to an anti-ICE Signal chat by the restaurant’s owner and the next thing they know a mob has showed up to accost them. And because Minneapolis has a “no cooperation with ICE policy” the local police are avoiding situations like this altogether- leaving regular citizens to fend for themselves and deal with these psychotic gangs of social justice warriors (sic)"", another wrote, ""It is a Maoist cultural revolution. Citizens forced into struggle sessions by the Democratic Red Guard (sic)"" and yet another tweeted, ""“…the encounter left some of them reconsidering their positions.” I would certainly hope so. If not, I don’t know what it would take (sic).""The episode has since become a flashpoint in the broader online debate over protest culture, misinformation, and whether social media–fuelled rapid-response activism is eroding basic norms of due process and personal safety.Minneapolis has become a flashpoint in the nationwide debate over immigration enforcement. Federal operations known as Operation Metro Surge have deployed thousands of immigration agents in the region, resulting in widespread protests, legal battles, and public safety concerns. The broader atmosphere has become fraught, with immigrant communities and local residents voicing strong opposition to ICE tactics and federal intervention.","Five software engineers were mistakenly labelled as federal immigration agents and confronted by an angry crowd outside the restaurant where they were dining.

NATO Surrenders Before Trump? ‘Only 34 Troops To Defend Greenland From US…’ | Shock Announcement





US President Donald Trump has written a blunt letter to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, linking the Nobel Committee’s decision not to award him the Nobel Peace Prize to his hardened stance on Greenland, saying he no longer feels bound to “think purely of Peace”.According to a copy of the letter obtained by Bloomberg, Trump’s message to the Norwegian leader — first reported by a PBS journalist on X — was circulated by the US National Security Council (NSC) to several other European governments, underscoring Washington’s intent to make the communication widely known.“Dear Jonas: Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America. Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a “right of ownership” anyway? There are no written documents, it’s only that a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also. I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States. The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland.Thank you! President DJT,” Trump wrote according to Bloomberg.Reacting to the letter, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre said Trump’s message was sent in response to a brief text message he had earlier conveyed to the US President.“Trump’s message came in response to a short text message to President Trump from me earlier in the day, on behalf of myself and the President of Finland, Alexander Stubb,” Støre said.Støre underlined that Trump had been repeatedly informed that the Nobel Peace Prize decision does not rest with the Norwegian government.“I have repeatedly clearly explained to Trump that it is an independent committee that awards the Nobel Peace Prize,” he said.Norway had expressed disbelief last week after Nobel Peace Prize laureate María Corina Machado handed her medal to US President Donald Trump, who has long coveted the award. Trump, who has repeatedly claimed he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for resolving multiple conflicts during his second term, accepted the medal during a meeting with the Venezuelan opposition leader at the White House.The move prompted a swift clarification from the Norwegian Nobel Committee.“The Nobel Prize and the laureate are inseparable,” the committee said in a statement on Friday. “Even if the medal or diploma later comes into someone else’s possession, this does not alter who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.”Trump’s letter to Norway PM follows a series of public statements in which he has accused Denmark of failing to counter what he describes as a Russian security threat in the Arctic.Earlier on Sunday, Trump said Denmark had not been able to do anything to remove the “Russian threat” from Greenland and added, “Now it is time, and it will be done!!!”“NATO has been telling Denmark, for 20 years, that ‘you have to get Russian threat away from Greenland.’ Unfortunately, Denmark has been unable to do anything about it,” Trump wrote in a post on his social media platform, Truth Social.Trump has repeatedly said he will settle for nothing less than ownership of Greenland, an autonomous territory that remains part of the Kingdom of Denmark.Leaders in both Denmark and Greenland have firmly rejected Trump’s position, insisting the island is not for sale and that Greenlanders do not wish to become part of the United States.The pressure campaign has also taken on an economic dimension. On Saturday, Trump vowed to impose a wave of escalating tariffs on European allies until the United States is allowed to buy Greenland.","US President Donald Trump has written a blunt letter to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre.

After Greenland Bid, Trump Warns Canada’s Arctic Is Exposed To Rivals Russia & China





US President Donald Trump late Sunday once again strongly reiterated his desire to bring Greenland under American control, claiming that Denmark had failed to counter the “Russian threat” to the Arctic island and declaring that “now it is time, and it will be done. ”In a post on Truth Social, Trump renewed his allegations against Denmark to justify his push for Greenland. He wrote, “Nato has been telling Denmark for 20 years that ‘you have to get the Russian threat away from Greenland.’ Unfortunately, Denmark has been unable to do anything about it. Now it is time, and it will be done!!!”At the start of 2026, Trump has made his intentions increasingly clear. He began with a US strike on Venezuela that led to the ouster of President Nicolas Maduro, who was subsequently taken into American custody along with his wife. Trump then turned his attention to Greenland, saying the island should come under US control.However, both the Danish and Greenlandic governments have strongly opposed Trump’s proposal, with several European Union leaders also backing them and questioning the US president’s motives regarding the Arctic island.Earlier, Trump also threatened tariffs on any countries who don't abide by his motive of acquiring Greenland.European nations including Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom released a joint statement, which was later shared by Danish ministry of foreign affairs, said that the military exercise ""Arctic Endurance"" poses no threat to anyone and stressed on full solidarity with Denmark and people of Greenland.The statement also warned that the threat of tariffs could undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral.On Saturday, Trump threatened to impose tariffs on the United Kingdom and other European countries unless they agreed to sell Greenland. He claimed the move was necessary for national security, citing Chinese and Russian interest in the territory.Trump offered to negotiate with European nations but warned that tariffs could escalate to 10 percent from February 1, 2026, and 25 percent from June 1, 2026, if no deal was reached, saying it was “time for Denmark to give back” after years of US support.The people of Greenland also voiced their resistance to Trump by holding protests across the snow-covered island, among the first such demonstrations of its kind there.Meanwhile, Trump also wrote to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, citing the Nobel Committee’s decision not to award him the Nobel Peace Prize and declaring that he no longer felt bound to “think purely of peace,” even as he repeatedly threatened action over Greenland.

Mary L Trump, the niece of Donald Trump , weighed in on a letter sent by the US president to Norway’s prime minister, in which the GOP leader linked America’s bid to annex Greenland to his failure to win the Nobel Peace Prize Posting on X, Mary Trump said: “When I saw this letter, I literally thought, ‘This is too stupid even for him.’ I should have known better.”Her comment followed reports detailing Trump’s message to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, which has stirred fresh controversy over Greenland, Nato and global security.According to the message, Trump told Støre he no longer felt obliged to focus only on peace after not being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last year. He blamed Norway for the decision, despite being told that the prize is awarded by an independent committee, not the Norwegian government. The prize was given to Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado in 2025. Few days ago, Machado presented her medal to Trump in the White House.In the same letter, Trump insisted that US needed “Complete and Total Control of Greenland”, the semi-autonomous Danish territory.Asked later whether he would use force to seize it, Trump replied “no comment”.Denmark governs Greenland and is a Nato member. It warned that any US military action against the island would effectively end the alliance. Several European Nato members sent small numbers of troops to Greenland last week in a reconnaissance mission.Trump responded by announcing a 10 per cent tariff on goods from eight Nato allies starting from February 1. He warned the tariff could rise to 25 per cent by June if countries opposed his plan to take control of Greenland.In his reply to Støre, Trump wrote: “Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace.” He also questioned Denmark’s claim to Greenland, saying there were no written documents proving ownership.“I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States,” Trump added.The MAGA chief concluded by saying the world was not secure unless the US had “Complete and Total Control of Greenland”.Trump has repeatedly claimed he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, saying he ended eight wars during his second term.Mary Trump is a psychologist and outspoken critic of her president uncle.

Prior arrest and mental health history





A 29-year-old Florida man, identified by authorities as Ahmad Jihad Bojeh, is facing murder charges after three tourists were found shot to death near Walt Disney World.Bojeh was arrested Saturday afternoon and charged with three counts of first-degree murder after authorities say he carried out an unprovoked, “cold-blooded” shooting of three men vacationing in the area.According to the Osceola County Sheriff’s Office, deputies responded to reports of gunfire around 12:13 p.m. Saturday at a rental home located on Indian Point Circle in the Indian Hills subdivision of Kissimmee, a neighborhood frequently used by tourists visiting Walt Disney World.When deputies arrived, they found three men dead from gunshot wounds in front of the home. Sheriff Christopher Blackmon described the killings as random and premeditated and added that there was no known conflict between the suspect and the victims.“This was just random,” Blackmon said. “And this happened to be the person who lived next door.”Authorities identified the victims as: Robert Lewis Kraft, 70, of Holland, Michigan; Douglas Joseph Kraft, 68, of Columbus, Ohio; and James John Puchan, 69, of Columbus, Ohio.Robert and Douglas Kraft were brothers. The men were staying at the rental property as tourists. Investigators said a fourth member of their group had left the property the day before, and the remaining three were stranded due to car trouble, which forced them to extend their stay.Ahmad Jihad Bojeh lived next door to the rental home where the victims were staying. Sheriff Blackmon described him as a “troubled person,” and a frequent subject of law enforcement calls in the neighborhood.“I can tell you he was a threat to that neighborhood all the time,” Blackmon said. “He was a known person, a frequent flier to the sheriff’s office.”Bojeh was taken into custody about an hour after the shooting and found inside his residence without incident.According to the court records, Bojeh was previously arrested in 2021 after allegedly firing a gun at a person and multiple vehicles in a Wawa gas station parking lot in Kissimmee, injuring one man. Surveillance video from that incident reportedly showed Bojeh shooting at passing cars.Despite video and witness evidence, Bojeh was later found not guilty by reason of insanity, with a competency hearing scheduled in that case. Sheriff Blackmon said concerns about Bojeh persisted after that ruling.Following his arrest in the current case, detectives executed a search warrant at Bojeh’s home and recovered two firearms. Authorities are investigating whether either weapon was used in the killings.Bojeh is currently being held at the Osceola County Jail without bond. Officials say there is no ongoing threat to the community, but the investigation remains in its early stages.","Ahmad Jihad Bojeh, 29, was arrested Saturday afternoon and charged with three counts of first-degree murder.

Disputed letter resurfaces amid broader protest trend





A ten-foot installation invoking the Trump–Epstein birthday letter controversy has been placed on the National Mall, visually enlarging a document Donald Trump has long denied authoring and pushing it back into the political spotlight.The structure stands across from the US Capitol at 3rd Street between Madison and Jefferson Drive. One side of the installation reproduces the alleged birthday letter attributed to Donald Trump, bordered by a drawing of a woman. The text includes the line, “We have certain things in common, Jeffrey,” and ends with, “A pal is a wonderful thing. Happy Birthday— and may every day be another wonderful secret.”The reverse side features a shorter message: “Happy Birthday to a ‘Terrific Guy!’”, surrounded by balloon imagery. Together, the two panels form a giant mockup of the birthday card that has been the subject of renewed political scrutiny in recent months. The timing of the installation is apt, as January 20 is the birth date of Jeffrey Epstein.The installation was created by an organization calling itself the Secret Handshake, which described the statue as an interactive protest rather than a static monument. Visitors are encouraged to “sign” the oversized card with messages addressed to the administration.Placed beside the mockup is a smaller sculpture depicting stacked boxes meant to resemble redacted files. A plaque accompanying the display reads:“The Secret Handshake invites you to celebrate the birthday of President Donald Trump’s ‘closest friend,’ Jeffrey Epstein, with a larger than life tribute to their intimate correspondence.Feel Free To Sign The Birthday Card With Your Own Message To The Administration.”The group said the statue was installed overnight on Sunday, deliberately timed to appear one day before Epstein’s birthday. According to the Secret Handshake, the installation has been granted permission to remain on the National Mall until Friday.Few people have already started arriving there and they are dropping messages. A picture posted online shows what people have written. One visitor wrote, ""History has its eyes on you!""While someone else etched with a colored pen, ""The time is always right to the right thing. IMPEACH.""The news of the statue has spread on the internet. Netizens are reacting to the wild statue. One user said, ""HOLY SMOKES: A giant replica of the Trump-to-Epstein birthday card just got planted on the National Mall in D.C. today. Front reads: “Happy Birthday to a ‘Terrific Guy!’” And the inside is printed with the bizarre Trump–Epstein dialogue. Sometimes the receipts don’t need a caption. They need a billboard.""Another commented, ""Trump should stroll out there today and sign it""""lmfao this is golden."" wrote third.The birthday message referenced by the statue was released in September by Democrats on the House Oversight Committee. The letter, dated 2003, was attributed to Trump during Epstein’s 50th birthday celebrations. Trump has denied writing or sending it, calling the document “false, malicious, and defamatory.”The mockup is the latest in a series of anti-Trump installations that have appeared on the National Mall in recent months. Previous displays have included a statue depicting Trump holding hands with Epstein, a large gold thumb crushing the Statue of Liberty’s head, a sculpture of Trump dancing inside a gold television set, a “giant bronze poop” statue referencing the January 6 insurrection, and multiple smaller versions of the same theme.",A ten-foot installation invoking the Trump–Epstein birthday letter controversy has been placed on the National Mall.

'Mentality of a rapist': Danish politician hopes Trump aide Stephen Miller is kept away from young women,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/mentality-of-a-rapist-danish-politician-hopes-trump-aide-stephen-miller-is-kept-away-from-young-women/articleshow/126713438.cms,"'As I didn't get Nobel...'





Danish parliamentary member Rasmus Jarlov hoped US President Donald Trump's aide Stephen Miller is kept away from young women, as Miller has the mentality of a rapist, Jarlov said, referring to his recent aggressive comment on Denmark. Amid Trump's push for Greenland, which has been under Denmark, Stephen Miller said Denmark is so tiny that it can not defend Greenland.""Denmark is a tiny country with a tiny economy and a tiny military. They cannot defend Greenland. They cannot control the territory of Greenland. Under every understanding of law that has existed about territorial control for 500 years. To control a territory, you have to be able to defend a territory, improve a territory, inhabit a territory. Denmark has failed on every single one of these tests,"" Miller said.After being asked to comment on Stephen Miller's observation, Jarlov said: “I hope he’s kept away from young women, because that’s the mentality of a rapist. You can’t defend yourself, so I’m going to take you. That’s basically what he’s saying.”“United States have signed several treaties with Denmark recognizing the ownership, one of them was in 1917,” Jarlov said.“So, this is a new position from the American government, and we have to be able to trust the promises, the words and the alliances that we make with the Americans, because otherwise it’s not worth anything, being an ally of the Americans,” he said. “And I think it’s very crucial that we stay together because our alliance, our partnership, has kept us safe.In the latest development on Greenland, Trump has now claimed that he will acquire Greenland as he didn't win the Nobel Peace Prize. ""Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America,"" Trump wrote in the message to Norway's leader Jonas Gahr Store.""As regards the Nobel Peace Prize, I have on several occasions clearly explained to Trump what is well known, namely that it is an independent Nobel Committee, and not the Norwegian government, that awards the prize,"" Store replied.","US President Donald Trump's aide Stephen Miller said Denmark is so tiny that it can not defend Greenland.

The Department of Homeland Security on Monday announced that more than 10,000 illegal immigrants have been arrested in the Minneapolis area since the start of President Donald Trump’s second term, a claim that comes amid widespread protests against the administration’s deportation drive and intensified demonstrations following the fatal shooting of 37-year-old American woman Renee Nicole Good by an ICE agent.DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said nearly 3,000 arrests have occurred in the past six weeks alone, following a significant surge of federal agents deployed to the region.According to DHS, personnel from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Customs and Border Protection, Homeland Security Investigations, and other agencies have been involved in the operation.“PEACE AND PUBLIC SAFETY IN MINNEAPOLIS!” Noem wrote in a post on X, claiming those arrested included individuals convicted of serious crimes such as murder, sexual assault, and child exploitation.She accused Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey of failing to protect residents by opposing aggressive federal enforcement measures.Mayor Frey drew national attention Sunday after describing the expanded ICE presence as an “invasion” during an appearance on CNN’s State of the Union. He has repeatedly criticised the federal response as excessive.Noem also alleged widespread fraud tied to Minnesota’s social services system, asserting that investigators are probing what she claimed could total at least $19 billion in fraudulent activity.“There is MASSIVE Fraud in Minneapolis, at least $19 billion, and that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Our Homeland Security Investigators are on the ground in Minneapolis, conducting wide scale investigations to get justice for the American people who have been robbed blind. MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN,” she wrote.The figure exceeds previous estimates cited by federal prosecutors, who have publicly referenced billions in alleged misuse of state and federal funds. DHS officials say Homeland Security Investigations agents are actively conducting inquiries across the Minneapolis area.The announcement comes amid massive protests across the US following the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, a Minneapolis mother of three, who was killed by an ICE agent earlier this month. Her death has sparked huge outrage, with activists demanding accountability and an end to what they describe as violent ICE tactics.In response to ongoing protests, the Pentagon confirmed that approximately 1,500 active-duty soldiers stationed in Alaska have been placed on standby for potential deployment. Mayor Frey has called the move a “ridiculous” overreaction, emphasising that most demonstrations have remained peaceful.On Sunday, the Department of Justice announced it is investigating protesters who disrupted services at a St. Paul church where a local ICE official reportedly serves as a pastor. Livestreamed footage from Black Lives Matter Minnesota showed demonstrators chanting “ICE out” and “justice for Renee Good” inside the church.","DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said nearly 3,000 arrests have occurred in the past six weeks alone.

'How greedy they are': Greenland leader blasts Americans as Trump revives Greenland takeover talk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-greedy-they-are-greenland-leader-blasts-americans-as-trump-revives-greenland-takeover-talk/articleshow/126700720.cms,"'Trump Would Go Down...': Russia Refuses To Deny Interest In Greenland As US-EU Trade Warnings

Netizens react to the viral clip







Greenland is not for sale and every person inhabiting the Danish island is making it clear, raising their voice as loud as it takes to reach the ears of ambitious American President Donald Trump. After thousands of Greenlanders marched through the streets on Saturday to protest against the pressure from the US to take control of the territory, a politician from the island is raising her voice again.In a video going viral over the internet, Greenlandic politician Tillie Martinussen boldly rejected the American ambitions toward the island, highlighting how Americans are ""rich"" yet ""greedy"" and Greenlanders would never want to join the country.""We don't really value cash, Kardashian lips and fake boobs, very highly. Actually, you can not even own land in Greenland. You can get allotment for your house, which you own the house on top of the land,"" she revealed.""Greenlanders don't believe that the land is for one person, nor is the sea. It's a big miscalculation if he thinks Greenlanders would be incited by cash or something like that. We are not,"" claimed Martinussen.She added how the people of the island would not give up free healthcare, education, being a part of Europe, sovereignty, and more. “We do not want to be rich like the Americans are, see how greedy they are, even trying to shoot or invade their friends just for greed.The politician added that the Greenlanders are aware of the riches, such as minerals in their underground, but even if they were not present, they still would not be willing to merge with America. “Everyone here knows about the Inuit in Alaska, and the native tribes, Indians, American-Indians. Their land was taken from them, and they were not treated well.”“We know Trump has surrounded himself with, white power people, and we are not white. We are people of colour. We know our rights would likely be taken away,” she added invoking the current condition of American domestic politics.People in the comments noted how being rich Americans was no longer a point of prestige, but rather something that people would resist being. They also noted Martinussen's insulting take on America with some lauding it and others criticising.""That is not a throwaway jab, it is a full moral indictment. It flips the usual American self-image on its head: wealth is not automatically admired, and power is not automatically respected,"" wrote a person in an X post.""This is what Trump has done to America's reputation. Disgusting!"" added another social media user.""The fact that they see the U.S. as white power, that greed is running high, and that they are people of colour who don’t trust our government says a lot."" claimed another.""Yep that's a thousand pointer,"" added another.On January 17, thousands of Greenlanders took to the streets to protest the American demand. In Nuuk, the capital, demonstrators waved national flags and carried signs reading, ""Greenland is not for sale"" as they walked from the city centre to the US Consulate. Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen also joined the march at a point, raising the flag as the crowd cheered.","Greenlandic politician Tillie Martinussen boldly rejected the American ambitions toward the island.
