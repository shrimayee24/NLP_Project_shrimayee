"Andhra: Vizag Police bust cybercrime racket, arrest three for trafficking youth to Cambodia, Myanmar, and Thailand",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/andhra-vizag-police-bust-cybercrime-racket-arrest-three-for-trafficking-youth-to-cambodia-myanmar-and-thailand/articleshow/110241694.cms,"VISAKHAPATNAM: The

Visakhapatnam police

claimed to have busted a

cybercrime racket

and arrested three consultancy agents for allegedly luring unemployed youths and sending them to Chinese-operated cybercrime rings in countries such as Cambodia, Myanmar, and Thailand, officials said on Saturday.

Despite growing awareness of cybercrime, incidents continue to rise, with many still falling prey to sophisticated scams.

To combat this, Visakhapatnam police launched an operation to root out these criminal activities, according to an official release.

Their efforts led to the arrest of consultancy agents from the Gajuwaka area, including the main suspect, Chukka Rajesh (33). The illegal racket came to light after Botcha Sankar, an ex-Navy employee, filed a complaint through the 1930 cybercrimes helpline.

Sankar's complaint was based on the account of a victim who had managed to escape.

Following the complaint, Visakhapatnam police arrested Chukka Rajesh, the ringleader, and his associates, Sabbavarapu Kondala Rao and Mannena Gnaneshwar Rao, both from the Gajuwaka area. The police investigation revealed a complex network of agents, including Santosh, Arya, Umamahesh, and Habib, who facilitated the

trafficking

.

Visakhapatnam Commissioner of Police, Ravi Shankar Ayyanar, told that they suspected there could be over 5,000 victims from Andhra Pradesh, especially from Srikakulam, Visakhapatnam, Anakapalli, Palasa, Rajamundry, Tuni, Amalapuram, and Anantapur, apart from Kolkata. He said that they are sharing the investigation details with the Indian Embassy in Cambodia and appealed to the parents of victims to approach them and the Indian Embassy in Cambodia.

Cases were registered against the three local agents for

human trafficking

, extortion, wrongful confinement, and criminal conspiracy.

CP Ravi Shankar further said that the Indian agents in Cambodia called the local agents to arrange people for cybercrimes in the name of data entry jobs. The local agents collected Rs 1.50 lakh from each job aspirant, out of which they sent Rs 80,000 to the Cambodian agents for passports, visas, and other arrangements, and kept the rest as their commission, he pointed out.

Upon reaching Cambodia, these youths were locked up as slaves and forced to operate in the cybercrime network. They were denied food and pay until they complied. The agents gave them training before deploying them to commit various online frauds, through which they robbed innocent people of their hard-earned money.

""Courier scams, cryptocurrency scams, task games, and OTP frauds are some of the offenses committed by them,"" he said.

""Those who work properly will be given a salary of 600 dollars, besides incentives, and promotions. As per the investigation, the victims are forced to work for at least one year,"" he added.

During the investigation, the police verified the facts through a video call with the victims, CP Ravi Shankar said, adding that the victims had shared their hardships. Once they agreed, the men and women were sent to countries like Cambodia, Myanmar, and Thailand, where they ended up working for

Chinese companies

.

These companies trained them for 7-10 days and forced them into engaging in cybercrime at an average salary of 600 dollars per month. Any resistance invited severe punishment, including torture and deprivation of food and water.

Officials said that approximately 5,000 people from Andhra Pradesh had fallen victim to this scam over the past two years. The victims went to Cambodia on tourist visas, which were converted into business visas once they joined Chinese companies, they added.","Police arrest three consultancy agents for allegedly luring unemployed youths and sending them to Chinese-operated cybercrime rings.

Gaza Humanitarian Crisis: Fierce fighting on streets of Gaza's Rafah,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/fierce-fighting-on-streets-of-gazas-rafah/articleshow/110236853.cms,"RAFAH: Heavy clashes and bombardment rocked Rafah on Saturday, as Israel pressed an assault against Hamas militants that has led hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to flee the southern Gaza city.The Israeli military said its air forces hit more than 70 targets across the Gaza Strip while ground troops conducted ""targeted raids"" in eastern Rafah, killing 50 militants and locating dozens of tunnel shafts.Hamas's armed wing, the ezzedine al-qassam Brigades, said it fired a barrage of rockets towards the Israeli city of Ashkelon and targeted an Israeli command centre at the Jabalia refugee camp in the north of the Gaza Strip.An AFP reporter said air strikes and artillery shells pounded eastern Rafah as warplanes criss-crossed over the city on Gaza's border with Egypt.More than 10 days into what the army called a ""limited"" operation in Rafah that sparked an exodus of Palestinians, fighting between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants has also flared again in northern Gaza.Israel said in early January it had dismantled Hamas's command structure in the north, but the army said Hamas whose October 7 attack sparked the war had been ""in complete control here in Jabalia until we arrived a few days ago"".Hamas slammed what it called Israel's ""intensified brutal raids"" on Jabalia, saying they had killed dozens of civilians and wounded hundreds more while targeting schools and shelters.""The escalating crimes of the occupation will not succeed in breaking the will of our brave resistance or in deterring our proud people from their decision to stand firm on their land,"" it said.The Israeli incursion into Rafah, launched despite overwhelming international opposition and as mediators were hoping for a breakthrough in stalled truce talks, has worsened an already dire humanitarian crisis, aid groups say.With key land crossings closed or operating at limited capacity due to the fighting, some relief supplies began flowing into Gaza via a temporary, floating pier constructed by the United States.The Israeli army said 310 pallets began moving ashore in ""the first entry of humanitarian aid through the floating pier"".Satellite pictures taken on Saturday showed more than a dozen trucks lining up on the approach road to the pier.In the coming days, around 500 tonnes of aid are expected to be delivered to Gaza through the pier, according to US Central Command.But UN agencies and humanitarian aid groups have warned sea or air deliveries cannot replace far more efficient truck convoys into Gaza, where the United Nations has repeatedly warned of looming famine.The EU welcomed the first shipment from Cyprus to the Gaza pier, but called on Israel to ""expand deliveries by land and to immediately open additional crossings"".The Rafah crossing, a vital conduit for humanitarian assistance, has been closed since Israel launched its operation in the city last week.The war began after Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.Israel's retaliatory offensive against Hamas has killed at least 35,386 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to data provided by the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.The toll includes at least 83 deaths over the past 24 hours, said a ministry statement on Saturday.Out of 252 people taken hostage from Israel during the October 7 attack, 125 remain held in Gaza including 37 the army says are dead.The army said troops in Gaza had recovered late Thursday the bodies of three hostages whom it said had been killed on October 7.Israel has vowed to defeat remaining Hamas forces in Rafah, which it says is the last bastion of the Iran-backed group.The looming Israeli assault has prompted nearly 6,40,000 of the 1.4 million people who had been sheltering in the southern city to flee to other areas, the UN has said.Palestinian sources in Rafah said Israeli forces were operating in the city's Al-Salam and Jenina neighbourhoods as well as on the Philadelphi route along the Egyptian border.""Troops are advancing and retreating around these areas,"" a security source said.Cairo, which has been involved in mediation efforts during the war, says a potential Israeli takeover of Philadelphi could violate its landmark 1979 peace deal with Egypt.In northern Gaza's beit lahia, witnesses reported air strikes near Kamal Adwan hospital on Saturday.The hospital's director Hussam Abu Safiya said Friday the facility had received ""large numbers"" of casualties from nearby Jabalia and was running low on supplies.The fuel aid that had reached the hospital was ""barely enough for a few days"", Abu Safiya told AFP.The World Health Organization has received no medical supplies in Gaza since the Rafah operation began on May 6, spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said Friday.On the diplomatic front, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan was heading to the region for weekend talks.Sullivan will meet Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Saturday and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday, national security council spokesman John Kirby said.Meanwhile, Israel said it killed two senior Islamic Jihad militants in separate air strikes in the northern West Bank and in Rafah.The armed wing of Islamic Jihad confirmed a local commander was killed in an overnight strike on the West Bank's Jenin refugee camp.But there was no immediate comment from the group, which has fought alongside Hamas, on the army's announcement that a ""significant"" operative was killed in Rafah.A military statement did not name the slain militant and said he had been involved in ""preparing... for operations against IDF (army) ground troops in the area"".",Hamas's armed wing says it fired a barrage of rockets towards the Israeli city of Ashkelon. Israel says its air forces hit more than 70 targets across the Gaza Strip. The Israeli incursion into Rafah has worsened an already dire humanitarian crisis.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110236983,imgsize-134296,width-400,resizemode-4/110236983.jpg"

Robert Fico: All you need to know about Slovak PM targeted in assassination attempt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/who-is-robert-fico-all-you-need-to-know-about-slovak-pm-targeted-in-assassination-attempt/articleshow/110162816.cms,"Who is Robert Fico?

Fico, who is serving as a premier for the third time, along with his leftist party Direction – Social Democracy (Smer), emerged victorious in Slovakia’s parliamentary elections held on September 30, 2023. This victory marked a political resurgence for him, as he campaigned on a platform supporting Russia and opposing America.

Critics were concerned that under Fico, Slovakia might deviate from its pro-Western path and align with the direction taken by Hungary under the populist Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.

The victory in 2023 signifies Fico serving his fourth term as the prime minister, after previously occupying the position from 2006 to 2010, from 2012 to 2018, and once more from 2023. Fico's political career is remarkable due to his achievement as the prime minister with the longest tenure in Slovakia's history, spanning more than ten years.

Rise to political prominence

In 1992, Fico started his political career by winning a seat in the Slovak Parliament when Czechoslovakia was still united.

In his early career, he was appointed to the Council of Europe, where he acquired valuable political experience. In 1999, Fico established the Direction – Social Democracy (Smer) party, a political movement that he has been leading since it started.

Fico rose to power after his party won the 2006 parliamentary election, resulting in the establishment of his initial cabinet. His political position is commonly characterized as populist, attracting a wide range of voters through a combination of social welfare policies and nationalistic language.

After the 2010 parliamentary election, Fico moved into a position as a member of parliament in the opposition, ultimately becoming the leader of the opposition. His political strength was shown in 2012 when a vote of no confidence in the Iveta Radičová cabinet resulted in early elections. Fico's Smer party achieved a significant win, obtaining 83 seats and establishing a government with an overwhelming majority, the first of its kind in Slovakia since the end of communism in 1989.

In 2013, Fico announced that he was running for the 2014 presidential election. However, he lost to his political rival Andrej Kiska in the second round of voting. Despite this defeat, Fico continued to be an important figure in Slovak politics.

Fico's third term as prime minister ended suddenly in March 2018 during a political crisis that occurred after the murder of investigative journalist Ján Kuciak. This crisis resulted in extensive protests and demands for government accountability. As a response, Fico stepped down, and Deputy PM Peter Pellegrini took over.

The parliamentary election of 2023 signified the comeback of Fico to a position of authority. His campaign centered on ending military assistance to Ukraine during the Russian invasion, a position that struck a chord with a large segment of the voters. Smer emerged victorious in the election, securing the highest number of votes at 22.95% and 42 seats.

Fico established a coalition government with Voice – Social Democracy (Hlas) and the Slovak National Party, commencing his fourth tenure as prime minister on October 25, 2023.

In his current term, the government led by Fico has adopted a controversial position on global matters, particularly by declining to participate in a coalition led by the Czech Republic consisting of approximately 20 countries to offer military assistance to Ukraine.

Europe on edge

In a disturbing incident that has sent shockwaves across Europe, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico was targeted in an assassination attempt that left him seriously injured. The event unfolded on a seemingly ordinary day in Handlova, Slovakia, when Fico was approached by a gunman as he was engaging with supporters. The assailant fired five times at close range, critically wounding the prime minister.The PM's bodyguards swiftly intervened, tackling the gunman and whisking Fico away in a government vehicle.He was subsequently airlifted to a hospital for emergency medical treatment.""I was very shocked ... fortunately as far as I know the operation went well - and I guess in the end he will survive ... he's not in a life-threatening situation at this moment,"" Slovak Deputy Prime Minister and Environment Minister Tomas Taraba told the BBC's Newshour.The attacker, identified as 71-year-old Slovak poet Juraj Cintula, was arrested at the scene. The motivations behind the attack appear to be politically charged, reflecting deep divisions within Slovakia and broader regional tensions. Cintula reportedly made a ""confession"" in custody, blaming Fico's media policies for his drastic actions.A seasoned figure in Slovakian politics, Fico was born in 1964 and began his political career as a member of the Communist Party before Slovakia became its independent nation. With a law degree and vast experience in legal and governmental roles, Fico has been a dominant force in Slovak politics.Fico's political journey is marked by significant milestones, including his first election to Slovakia's parliament in 1992 and his subsequent rise to become the chairman of the Smer (Direction) party in 1999. His tenure is characterized by a left-populist ideology, though comparisons have been drawn with right-wing leaders like Viktor Orbán of Hungary.After a hiatus, Fico reclaimed the prime ministerial position last year, marking his third term and establishing him as the longest-serving head of government in Slovakia's history. His recent electoral victory was fueled by a platform that controversially aligned more closely with pro-Russian stances and criticized US and Nato policies, especially regarding the situation in Ukraine.This assassination attempt occurs against a backdrop of heightened geopolitical tension. Fico, known for his pro-Putin stance, has been a controversial figure in European politics, especially regarding his opposition to supporting Ukraine against Russian aggressions.Starting his fourth term as prime minister, Fico administration stopped arms shipments to Ukraine, and critics are concerned that he might steer Slovakia — a Nato member with a population of 5.4 million — away from its pro-Western trajectory towards a path similar to that of Hungary under populist Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.Russian President Vladimir Putin , who has shown support for Fico in the past, condemned the attack. Describing the shooting as a ""monstrous"" crime, Putin said in a telegram sent to Slovakia's President Zuzana Caputova: ""I know Robert Fico as a courageous and strong-minded man. I very much hope that these qualities will help him to survive this difficult situation.""The implications of this attack are far-reaching, raising concerns about the stability of not only Slovakia but the entire European region. Fico’s policies and his alignment with Russia have been divisive, and this incident may further inflame political tensions.World leaders, including US President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy , have condemned the attack. The European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen emphasized that such acts of violence undermine democracy and have no place in society.Colonel Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a former commanding officer of UK's 1st Royal Tank Regiment, expressed his concerns to Daily Mail, saying, ""There are high stakes in Europe and the threat of a wider war only benefits Putin.""He further warned, ""This is yet another wake-up call to the West.

Xi Jinping is now Vladimir Putin's 'big brother': How Russia-China ties changed over the years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/xi-jinping-is-now-putins-big-brother-how-russia-china-ties-changed-over-the-years/articleshow/110162516.cms,"Driving the news

This is Putin's first trip abroad since his March re-election and the second in just over six months to China.

However, this is Putin's 19th visit to China since he became the Russian president.

In February 2022, China and Russia announced a ""no limits"" partnership during Putin's visit to Beijing, occurring just days before he deployed tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine, sparking the most severe land conflict in Europe since World War Two.

Putin's decision to choose China for his first overseas visit after being inaugurated for a new six-year term, extending his leadership until at least 2030, underscores the significance he places on his bond with Xi and his global strategic priorities.

In a discussion with China's Xinhua news agency, Putin commended Chinese President Xi Jinping for fostering a ""strategic partnership"" between Russia and China, which he described as rooted in national interests and profound mutual trust.

Zoom in

This visit is not just a routine diplomatic engagement but a strategic display of defiance against Western pressures.

The frequency and depth of military collaborations, such as joint naval drills near strategic global areas, signal a growing military camaraderie.

However, these maneuvers signal more about the depth of their partnership than actual operational military alliances. The joint naval patrols near American waters and the inclusion of Russia in Chinese-led military drills are significant developments that the West views with increasing concern.

Moreover, the economic interdependence, highlighted by China’s role as a critical supplier to Russia’s defense sector, showcases the depth of their bilateral ties, which are becoming increasingly consequential in the global arena.

Why it matters

The strengthening bond between China and Russia is pivotal as both nations seek to assert their power on the global stage against a backdrop of American dominance.

This alliance is particularly critical for Russia as it continues to face extensive economic sanctions from the West.

China’s support not only bolsters Russia’s economy but also enhances its military capabilities through joint exercises and technology transfers.

As per a report in the Economist, the flow of Chinese technology and other valuable goods to Russian weapons manufacturers has become a significant concern for the United States. According to US secretary of state Antony Blinken China was the ""top supplier"" of various items considered be ""dual use,"" including machine tools, microelectronics, and nitrocellulose, a vital component in artillery shells. These items have both civilian and military applications.

""Russia would struggle to sustain its assault on Ukraine without China's support,"" Blinken said. In a later conversation with Borge Brende, the president of the World Economic Forum, Blinken said that over the past year, Chinese technology had been facilitating Russia's production of weapons and ammunition, such as missiles and tanks, at an unprecedented rate in its modern history, surpassing even the levels seen during the Cold War era, the Economist report added.

What they are saying

""It was the unprecedentedly high level of the strategic partnership between our countries that determined my choice of China as the first state that I would visit after officially taking office as president of the Russian Federation,"" Putin said.

""We will try to establish closer cooperation in the field of industry and high technology, space and peaceful nuclear energy, artificial intelligence, renewable energy sources and other innovative sectors,"" Putin said.

""This is Putin's first trip after his inauguration, and it is therefore intended to show that Sino-Russian relations are moving up another level,"" independent Russian political analyst Konstantin Kalachev told AFP.

""The China-Russia relationship today is hard-earned, and the two sides need to cherish and nurture it,"" Xi told Putin.

""China is willing to ... jointly achieve the development and rejuvenation of our respective countries, and work together to uphold fairness and justice in the world,"" said Xi.

""The United States still thinks in terms of the Cold War and is guided by the logic of bloc confrontation, putting the security of 'narrow groups' above regional security and stability, which creates a security threat for all countries in the region,"" the joint statement said. ""The US must abandon this behaviour.""

The 'big brother' role reversal

The relationship between Russia and China has undergone a significant transformation in recent years, with Moscow becoming increasingly dependent on Beijing as it faces Western sanctions over the war in Ukraine.

Once a partnership of equals, the Russia-China dynamic has become increasingly asymmetrical, with China holding the upper hand. While China accounts for around 33% of Russia's overall trade, Russia makes up only 4% of China's trade, according to data provider CEIC Data.

China has emerged as a critical source of essential goods for Russia, supplying everything from electronics to washing machines to tractors.

However, Russia's arms exports to China have fallen precipitously in recent years, while China has become a significant provider of optics, microelectronics, drone engines, and other materials that enable Russia's weapons production. The energy trade between the two countries has also shifted in China's favor.

""It's a strategic partnership where both sides need each other but it's increasingly asymmetrical in China's favor,"" Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center in Berlin, told the Wall Street Journal. ""China is not only the more powerful partner, but also the one that has many more options than Russia and the war has exacerbated that.""

Russia, with its oil and gas now shunned in Europe, has had to sell at significant discounts to China.

China’s upper hand is evident in negotiations over new projects like the Power-of-Siberia 2 gas pipeline, where Beijing's reluctance to finalize terms highlights its leverage over Moscow.

Putin, who is sometimes known for his haughty displays of making other leaders wait during their visits to the Kremlin, has adopted a noticeably deferential tone towards Xi Jinping, a LA Times report said.

No wonder, an Economist report described the visit as ""Vladimir Putin will meet his big brother in Beijing.""

What next

China, once the junior partner of Moscow in the global Communist hierarchy, has emerged as by far the most powerful of Russia's friends in the world.

Consequently, in the evolving personal relationship between the two ""presidents for life"", Xi has emerged as the ""big brother"" to Putin.

At the same time, the strengthening ties between China and Russia represent a significant shift in global alliances and power structures. The implications of their collaboration will undoubtedly extend far beyond their own borders, challenging the current international order and testing the diplomatic resilience of the Western powers.

NEW DELHI: Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in Beijing on Thursday for a two-day state visit to China, underscoring the solidarity between the two allies as Russia continues its new offensive in Ukraine.Upon his arrival at dawn, Putin was greeted by an honor guard from the People's Liberation Army, the military branch of China's ruling Communist Party.His motorcade, flanked by a brigade of military police on motorcycles, proceeded into the city. Putin is scheduled to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping and other senior officials.(With inputs from agencies)",Putin's decision to choose China for his first overseas visit after being inaugurated for a new six-year term underscores the significance he places on his bond with Xi and his global strategic priorities. The strengthening bond between China and Russia is pivotal as both nations seek to assert their power on the global stage.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110162715,imgsize-29492,width-400,resizemode-4/110162715.jpg"

As the region begins the recovery process on Saturday, it will do so under a smog warning and rising temperatures across southern Texas. The national weather service in Houston has cautioned that with temperatures reaching around 90 degrees (32.2 C) this weekend, people should be aware of the symptoms of heat exhaustion and advised, ""Don't overdo yourself during the cleanup process.""The warm weather is a concern in a region where more than half a million homes and businesses remain without electricity as of Saturday morning, a significant decrease from the nearly 1 million initially affected, according to PowerOutage.us.The fierce storms on Thursday, with winds of up to 100 mph (161 kph), caused extensive damage, including blown-out windows in downtown Houston and a tornado touching down near the northwest suburb of Cypress.Harris County sheriff Ed Gonzalez reported three storm-related fatalities, including an 85-year-old woman whose home caught fire after being struck by lightning and a 60-year-old man who attempted to use his vehicle to power his oxygen tank. Houston mayor John Whitmire previously said that at least four people were killed in the city when the storms swept through Harris County.Harris County judge Lina Hidalgo warned that it could take ""weeks"" for power to be restored in some areas due to multiple transmission towers being down. She urged patience and acknowledged the ""horror stories of just terror and powerlessness"" that residents experienced during the storm.

To the east, heavy rainfall is possible in eastern Louisiana into central Alabama, with parts of Louisiana under a flash flood warning through Saturday.The widespread destruction brought much of Houston to a standstill, with trees, debris, and shattered glass littering the streets and one building's brick wall ripped off. School districts in the Houston area canceled classes for more than 400,000 students on Friday, and government offices were closed. City officials urged people to avoid downtown and stay off roads, many of which were flooded or lined with downed power lines and malfunctioning traffic lights.Mayor Whitmire warned that police, including state troopers sent to the area, were out in force to prevent looting. He acknowledged that the speed and intensity of the storm caught many off guard, saying, ""Most Houstonians didn't have time to place themselves out of harms way.""Noelle Delgado, executive director of Houston pets alive, an animal rescue organization, arrived at the facility on Thursday night to find the dogs and cats uninjured but the awning ripped off, the sign mangled, and water leaking inside.

At press conference in Harbin during his two-day trip to China Putin said that, Washington aims to prevent strong competitors from entering the American market, describing the US approach as “unfair competition.”“Unfortunately, the way the world works today, sometimes situations arise related to unfair competition .This is how the Americans recently imposed tariffs on Chinese electric transport, on electric cars,” he said.“Why? Because Chinese cars have gotten better.”Putin claimed that as soon as another country emerges as a manufacturing power and becomes more competitive, it is suppressed by the US and the EU alike.US officials have repeatedly described China as America’s top “competitor” while tightening economic restrictions against the country.Earlier this week, Washington increased tariffs on $18 billion worth of Chinese goods, including EVs, batteries, semiconductors, steel, aluminum, critical minerals, solar cells, ship-to-shore cranes, and medical products. This is in addition to the tariffs on over $300 billion worth of goods imposed by former President Donald Trump.Tariffs on Chinese goods were significantly hiked under Trump, who initiated a trade war in 2018. His successor, President Joe Biden, has continued this approach, adopting several policies aimed at the Chinese economy.Chinese officials have repeatedly denounced US trade and tech policies, describing them as “economic bullying.” In retaliation, the Chinese government has implemented countermeasures, including restrictions on exports of strategic raw materials used in defense technologies, electronics, and clean energy.The International Monetary Fund warned last week that the escalating trade war between Washington and Beijing poses a threat to global economic growth.","Russian President Vladimir Putin said that US authorities have imposed tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles (EVs) because they have become better.

US ambassador to Japan visits southern islands at the forefront of China tension,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-ambassador-to-japan-visits-southern-islands-at-the-forefront-of-china-tension/articleshow/110223509.cms,"TOKYO: May 18 (AP) The US ambassador to Japan stressed Friday the importance of increased deterrence and his country's commitment to its key ally as he visited two southwestern Japanese islands at the forefront of Tokyo's tension with Beijing. Rahm Emanuel visited Yonaguni , Japan's westernmost island just east of Taiwan, a self-governed island also claimed by China.He later visited another Japanese island, Ishigaki , home to Japan Coast Guard patrol boats defending the disputed East China Sea islands and Japanese fishermen from armed Chinese coast guard ships that routinely enter Japanese waters.Japan has been making a southwest shift of its defense posture, and is further accelerating its military buildup under a 2022 security strategy that focuses on counter-strike capability with long-range cruise missiles.Emanuel was the first US ambassador to visit Yonaguni. Escorted by Mayor Kenichi Itokazu, he looked toward Taiwan, only 110 kilometres (68 miles) away. He met with Japanese Self Defense Force service members at a local base installed in 2016 and where a missile defense system is planned.The ambassador said the main purpose of his visit was to show US support for the local fishing community. He also met with a local fisherman who was among those affected by China's increasingly assertive actions in the regional seas.China fired five missiles into Japan's exclusive economic zone in 2022 after the visit to Taiwan of then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Emanuel said the fisherman told him he could not sell his fish for about a week after the Chinese action.""If they don't have deterrence, that's going to be worse,"" Emanuel told The Associated Press from Ishigaki, the second island he visited Friday. ""If you have a very robust deterrence, it ensures that there is peace, ensures that there is security, ensures economic prosperity. Without that, it's more likely to be a green light to those that want to use economic coercion and confrontation as their only means of expression.""Emanuel said Yonaguni fishers still catch fish for a living, supporting the local economy and helping reinforce Japanese territorial rights. ""That's what a real win looks like - economic security,"" he said on social platform X.In Ishigaki, Japan's coast guard protects fishing boats in the disputed waters around the Japanese-controlled islands in the East China Sea that Tokyo calls Senkaku. Beijing also claims the islands and calls them Diaoyu, and its coast guard ships often face off with their Japanese counterparts.Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi welcomed the ambassador's trip to the islands, saying it was ""meaningful"" for the ambassador to improve his understanding of Tokyo's efforts in reinforcing its security in the southwestern region, where additional military units and missile defense systems are being deployed.While local officials back the reinforcement of Japanese troops on the islands, local residents staged a small protest amid concerns they may be the first to be affected in a possible US-China conflict.Okinawa's Gov. Denny Tamaki supports the Japan-US security alliance but has called for a reduction in the number of American troops housed on the island. About half of the 50,000 American troops in Japan are based in Okinawa.Tamaki also criticized the use of Yonaguni's commercial airport by a US military aircraft used by the ambassador.","US ambassador to Japan stresses importance of increased deterrence and commitment to key ally.

We've got to watch those votes.""Ahead of their November presidential rematch, Trump campaign officials have publicly and privately insisted that Trump can beat Biden in Minnesota. While an upset in the state appears possible, available polling and the state's political history indicate that the former president faces an uphill battle.Major independent polls show Biden with a slim but consistent lead in Minnesota - typically between 2 and 4 percentage points. A Trump campaign official would not say directly whether they planned to dedicate resources to the state.While Minnesota's rural areas have swung towards Republicans over the last decade, suburban areas around Minneapolis have moved toward Democrats, reflecting broader nationwide trends.During the speech, Trump repeated his calls for a ""massive deportation"" of immigrants in the country illegally, and he doubled down on promises to construct a new missile defense system, likening it to Israel's ""Iron Dome"" program.He also again hinted that North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, a former primary rival who introduced Trump on Friday evening, was a top contender to be his vice-presidential running mate.""A lot of people think it's that guy right there,"" Trump said of Burgum. ""He's very good.""As with other recent speeches, Trump took personal and even profane jabs at Biden throughout the evening, at one point saying the president was ""full of shit.""During presidential campaigns, it is common for major candidates to insist they can capture states that appear to be a reach. Biden officials say they have a shot at taking Florida, though he is trailing by around 10 points there in most polls.","Donald Trump falsely claimed on Friday that he won the 2020 presidential election in Minnesota.

They condemned this as a fascist tactic designed to silence opposition and restrict media freedom , according to several media reports.A joint statement was released on Friday by PFUJ President Afzal Butt and Secretary General Arshad Ansari.They criticized the authorities for implementing authoritarian measures that hinder journalists from carrying out their duties and holding those in power accountable.The PFUJ expressed alarm over the Punjab government 's decision to revise the defamation law, while also highlighting Defence Minister Khawaja Asif's disclosure of plans to penalise individuals involved in the dissemination of classified documents, as reported by Dawn.The union stated that Asif detailed punitive measures. These measures include a two-year imprisonment term for individuals who are found responsible for such actions.The PFUJ's statement follows the unveiling of a proposed amendment called the Punjab Defamation Bill 2024. The union considers it more draconian than the Defamation Ordinance of 2002, which was introduced during the tenure of military dictator Gen Pervez Musharraf.The bill is described as having a very broad definition of defamation. It also imposes severe financial penalties and extensive restrictions on commentary regarding ongoing legal proceedings. The PFUJ stated that the main goal of the bill is to create fear among individuals who are thinking about criticizing or expressing grievances against those in positions of authority.The union of journalists raised concerns about amending defamation laws. They suggested that the process lacked transparency and asserted that current laws already address defamation concerns.The PFUJ leaders accused Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz of using dictatorial tactics.

The leaders also urged the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) to support press freedom and oppose the proposed legislation.The PFUJ asserted that any legislative changes should involve consultation with all stakeholders. They accused Nawaz's administration of mirroring the repressive tactics employed by past military regimes. The PFUJ particularly highlighted concerns raised by Defence Minister Asif's statements, which they interpreted as echoing anti-democratic sentiments.Warning of widespread opposition from the journalist community, the union vowed to launch a nationwide campaign against what they perceive as fascist measures by the government.(with input from agency)",The Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) strongly criticized the federal and Punjab governments for their recent efforts to change the defamation law.
