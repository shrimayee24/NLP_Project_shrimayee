Religious traditions and practices should be respected. No exceptions to that.""Criticising Jagan, Naidu pointed out that while Jagan Reddy had admitted to reading the Bible, he should also respect Tirumala’s customs. ""When he said he respects other religions, he should also respect the traditions at Tirumala,"" Naidu said.Addressing another controversy, Naidu challenged Reddy’s claims about the purity of temple offerings. ""Jagan repeatedly says the same lie that no adulteration was done. AR dairy sent eight tankers of ghee. Four tankers have been consumed. After many complaints, samples from the remaining tankers were sent to NDDB,"" he asserted. He further accused Jagan of ""finding fault with the report given by NDDB,"" adding, ""We are obligated to reveal the report. We are answerable to people and devotees.""Naidu also announced plans to introduce legislation that would mandate only individuals from the same faith work in religious institutions. ""We are planning to bring a legislation making it mandatory that persons from the same faith work in religious institutions,"" he stated.In a broader criticism of the YSRC regime, Naidu pointed irregularities not only at Tirumala but also at various other temples, lamenting the lack of investigations into incidents such as the Ramatheertham idol vandalisation, Antarvedi chariot burning, and the theft of silver lion idols from the Durga temple. He remarked, ""Jagan did not go to Tirumala as he has to sign the declaration register, which he is not willing to do.""Earlier in the day, YSRCP chief Jagan Mohan Reddy, accused the TDP government of obstructing his temple visit . He alleged that state police, acting under Naidu's orders, had issued notices to YSRCP leaders instructing them not to participate in the event. ""Police clearly stated in the notices to YSRCP leaders that the visit to Tirumala has no permission ... why do we need police permission to visit the temple?"" Reddy questioned, accusing the TDP government of running a ""demon rule"" in Andhra Pradesh.Reddy also claimed that the police notices restricted YSRCP leaders from attending the program organized for his visit, stating, ""The notice states that the visit to the Tirumala temple is not permitted, and the program organised by YSRCP does not have the necessary approval.""","Andhra Pradesh chief minister Chandrababu Naidu on Friday dismissed Jagan Mohan Reddy's claim that he was denied entry to the Tirumala temple.

MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Friday directed police to identify a secluded spot for the burial of the body of Akshay Shinde , accused in the Badlapur sexual assault case , who was killed in a police shootout . A division bench of Justices Revati Mohite Dere and M M Sathaye said once the spot is identified, police shall inform Shinde’s family members about it so that the burial can be done.HC rejected the contention of the prosecution that there is no custom of burying bodies in Shinde’s community, calling it his parents’ choice.Shinde’s father on Friday moved an urgent application seeking a burial spot for his son. The father said they were unable to find a burial ground for Shinde.Public prosecutor Hiten Venegaonkar told the court that all burial grounds in Badlapur and neighbouring areas have refused and opposed the burial of Shinde. Police would take steps to identify a secluded spot for the burial, Venegaonkar told the court.He added police will also ensure that no untoward incident occurs.“The family will be informed about the same. But they need not make an event out of it. Let them do it silently. The family members will be taken (to burial spot) with police staff,” Venegaonkar said.The bench accepted the statement and posted the matter for hearing on September 30.Venegaonkar further said police had enquired and found out that there was no such custom of burying in Shinde’s community. “Our enquiry has found that there is no such custom of burial. The family’s lawyer made a comment that they are burying only so that there is the option of exhumation in future. All senior members of their community themselves have said there is no such custom,” the Public prosecutor said.The bench, however, said the community will not decide what the parents want.“Nobody has the right to decide. It is the parents’ choice,” HC said.The father’s advocate Amit Katarnaware told the high court the family had identified a spot and had also sought permission from the Ambernath Municipal Council. He further alleged the family was facing threats. The court said they could lodge a complaint with the police which would look into the same.","HC rejected the contention of the prosecution that there is no custom of burying bodies in Shinde’s community, calling it his parents’ choice.

It aggressively seeks the subjugation of 200 million Muslims and the obliteration of India's Islamic heritage,” he claimed.“Even more worryingly,” he said, India “is engaged in massive expansion of its military capabilities which are essentially deployed against Pakistan”. Its war doctrines envisage a surprise attack and a limited war under the nuclear overhang, he said, adding that India had spurned his country’s proposal for a mutual strategic restraint regime, and its leadership has “often threatened to cross the Line of Control” and take over what Pakistan refers to as “Azad Kashmir”.",Pakistan routinely raises the Kashmir issue at the annual UN debate.

The letter also called for the ""obliteration"" of Israel, which it accused of occupying Muslim territories, BBC reported.The US designated Hezbollah a terrorist organisation in 1997, five years after Nasrallah was chosen as its as its secretary-general.Hezbollah was established by members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard who arrived in Lebanon during the summer of 1982 to combat the invading Israeli forces.Under Nasrallah's leadership, Hezbollah played a pivotal role in the war of attrition that resulted in the withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon in 2000, ending an 18-year occupation.In 2006, Hezbollah engaged Israel in a 34-day conflict that ended in a stalemate, which he declared as ""divine victory.""A day after the Israel-Hamas war erupted on October 7, Hezbollah launched attacks on Israeli military posts along the border, labeling it a “backup front” for Gaza.""We are here paying the price for our front of support for Gaza, and for the Palestinian people, and our adoption of the Palestinian cause,"" Nasrallah said in a speech on August 1.Throughout the conflict, Hezbollah's leader has claimed that the group's cross-border strikes have diverted Israeli forces that would otherwise focus on Hamas in Gaza. He said that Hezbollah would not cease its attacks until a cease-fire is achieved in the region.As tensions escalated in recent weeks, Israel announced a new phase in the conflict aimed at pushing Hezbollah back from the border, allowing thousands displaced from northern Israel to return home.This escalation included strikes that resulted in the deaths of top Hezbollah military commanders and were linked to the destruction of numerous communications devices, including pagers used by the group, leading to 37 fatalities and thousands of injuries.",Israeli airstrikes destroyed six buildings in the southern suburb of Harek Hreik in Beirut on Friday. The Israeli military stated that a strike targeting Hezbollah's headquarters in Beirut resulted in numerous deaths and injuries.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday said that his government has not responded to a US and French proposal for a 21-day ceasefire with Hezbollah in Lebanon, instructing the military to continue fighting with ""full force.""The proposal, aimed at halting the escalating conflict along the Israel-Lebanon border, has not yet been addressed by Israel , according to a statement from Netanyahu’s office.""It is an American-French proposal, which the prime minister has not even responded to,"" the statement clarified, adding that Netanyahu has ordered the Israeli Defense Forces ( IDF ) ""to continue the fighting with full force.""

""Following precise intelligence guidance from the Air Force and the Intelligence Division, fighter jets targeted and eliminated (Srur), the commander of Hezbollah's air unit, in Beirut,"" a military statement said.IDF chief of staff Herzi Halevi issued a stern warning to Hezbollah, stating that a ground offensive was imminent. Speaking to soldiers of the 7th Armored Brigade during a military drill, Halevi declared, ""Your military boots will enter enemy territory, enter villages that Hezbollah has prepared as large military outposts, with underground infrastructure, staging points, and launchpads.""Halevi made it clear that Israeli forces are ready to engage Hezbollah directly. ""You are coming in much stronger and far more experienced than they are. You will go in, destroy the enemy there, and decisively destroy their infrastructure,"" he said, adding that the ultimate goal is to ""safely return the residents of the north.""Earlier this week, Hezbollah fired a Qadr 1 ballistic missile targeting the headquarters of Israel's intelligence service Mossad in Tel Aviv. While the missile was intercepted, it marked the first time Hezbollah has launched such a weapon towards Israel.In response, Israel launched a series of airstrikes on Hezbollah strongholds in Lebanon. According to Al Jazeera, the strikes have killed 569 people and wounded 1,835 others.The fighting in Gaza also shows no signs of slowing. The Gaza Health Ministry reported that at least 50 Palestinians were killed in Israeli airstrikes within the last 24 hours.

The Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) has released drone footage showing the targeted killing of Muhammad Hussein Srour , a top Hezbollah commander, in an airstrike .The footage showed multiple explosions rock a residential building in the Southern Suburb of Beirut.Born in 1973 in the southern Lebanese village of Aita al-Shaab, Srour, also known as 'Hajj Abu Saleh,' joined Hezbollah in 1996.He rose through the ranks, taking on various leadership positions within the organization and becoming a prominent figure in its military operations.Srour played a significant role in numerous strategic initiatives against Israeli forces and participated in Hezbollah's battles along Lebanon's eastern borders and in Syria. He was particularly recognized for his leadership of Hezbollah's aerial command and his alleged involvement in coordinating drone and explosive attacks targeting Israeli assets.""During the flight, I authorized a strike, and 'other things,' on the head of Hezbollah'sUAV unit, and he was killed. Our policy is clear - we will continue to hit Hezbollah with full force, and we will not stop until we achieve all our goals,"" stated Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, confirming Srour's death and his authorization of the strike while in flight.Srour played a crucial role in the development of Hezbollah's unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) capabilities in recent years. He established manufacturing facilities near civilian areas in southern Lebanon and Beirut, raising concerns about the safety of civilians amidst ongoing conflicts. Furthermore, he led Hezbollah's surface-to-air missile unit and was reportedly connected to operations involving Houthi forces in Yemen.The airstrike that killed Srour comes in the backdrop of escalating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, which intensified following the October 7 attack by Hamas. Since then, both sides have engaged in regular exchanges of fire, with Hezbollah launching rockets into northern Israel in response to the Hamas attack, leading to heightened military responses from both parties.","Muhammad Hussein Srour, a top Hezbollah commander, was killed in an airstrike.

We have to speak out every single time when something like that happens"", he added.Trump's comments at the Israeli-American Council National Summit included a warning that Israel would ""cease to exist"" if Harris were to win. He declared, “If I don’t win this election – and Jewish people would have a lot to do with that, 60 percent are voting for the enemy – Israel will cease to exist in two years.”Psaki pressed Emhoff on whether he believed Trump was putting a target on Jewish Americans, to which he responded affirmatively. “He is. I mean, take him at his word. This is a disgusting trope. The so-called dual loyalties. It is an outrage,” he said, urging Americans to combat ""antisemitism and hate.""When asked if he considered Trump 's statements antisemitic, Emhoff replied, “Of course it is, and I said that publicly.

Georgia governor says at least 11 people are dead in his state after Hurricane Helene,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/georgia-governor-says-at-least-11-people-are-dead-in-his-state-after-hurricane-helene/articleshow/113746946.cms,"CRAWFORDVILLE: Emergency crews rushed Friday to rescue people trapped in flooded homes after Helene roared ashore as a powerful Category 4 hurricane in Florida, generating a massive storm surge and knocking out power to millions of customers in several states.Gov. Brian Kemp said at least 11 people in his state were killed and dozens are still trapped in homes damaged by Helene.At least six others died in Florida and the Carolinas.The storm made landfall late Thursday in a sparsely populated region with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (225 kph) in the rural Big Bend area, home to fishing villages and vacation hideaways where Florida’s Panhandle and peninsula meet. But the damage extended hundreds of miles to the north, with flooding as far away as North Carolina, where a lake used in scenes from the movie “Dirty Dancing” overtopped a dam. Multiple hospitals in southern Georgia were without power.“Thank God we’re both alive to tell about it,” Rhonda Bell said after a towering oak tree outside her home in Valdosta, Georgia, smashed through the roof.Video on social media sites showed sheets of rain coming down and siding coming off buildings in Perry, Florida, near where the storm arrived. One local news station showed a home that was overturned, and many communities established curfews.“It’s really heartbreaking,” said Stephen Tucker, after the hurricane peeled off the brand-new roof at her church in Perry, Florida. It had to be replaced after last year’s Hurricane Idalia, and the congregation was just weeks away from moving back into the newly renovated sanctuary.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said the damage from Helene in the area appears to be greater than the combined damage of Idalia and Debby last August. “It’s demoralizing,” he said.President Joe Biden said he was praying for survivors as the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency headed to the area. The agency has deployed more than 1,500 workers, and they helped with 400 rescues by late morning.County officials immediately launched boats to reach stranded people, warning that the water could contain live wires, sewage, sharp objects and other debris.“If you are trapped and need help please call for rescuers – DO NOT TRY TO TREAD FLOODWATERS YOURSELF,” the sheriff’s office in Citrus County, Florida, warned in a Facebook post, while raising concerns that the tide could bring another surge of up to 10 feet (3.05 meters).Rescuers in Tampa also used boats to reach stranded residents. “Flooding was what we had warned everyone about,” Mayor Jane Castor said.More than 4 million homes and businesses were without power Friday morning in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, according to poweroutage.us, which tracks utility reports.One person was killed in Florida when a sign fell on their car, and two people were reported killed in a possible tornado in south Georgia as the storm approached. Trees that toppled onto homes were blamed for deaths in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Anderson County, South Carolina.The hurricane came ashore near the mouth of the Aucilla River on Florida’s Gulf Coast . That location was only about 20 miles (32 kilometers) northwest of where Hurricane Idalia hit last year at nearly the same ferocity and caused widespread damage.As the hurricane’s eye passed near Valdosta, a city of 55,000 near the Florida line, dozens of people huddled early Friday in a darkened hotel lobby. As the wind howled outside, water dripped from light fixtures in the lobby dining area.Fermin Herrera, 20, his wife and their 2-month-old daughter left their room on the top floor of the hotel, where they took shelter because they were concerned about trees falling on their Valdosta home.“We heard some rumbling,” said Herrera, cradling the sleeping baby in a downstairs hallway.Helene is the third storm to strike the city in just over a year. Tropical Storm Debby blacked out power to thousands in August, while Hurricane Idalia damaged an estimated 1,000 homes in Valdosta and surrounding Lowndes County a year ago.Soon after it crossed over land, Helene weakened to a tropical storm, with its maximum sustained winds falling to 70 mph (110 kph). At 11 a.m. Friday, the storm was about 105 miles (165 kilometers) northeast of Atlanta, moving north at 32 mph (52 kph) with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 kph), the National Hurricane Center in Miami reported.Forecasters expected the system to continue weakening as it moves into Tennessee and Kentucky and drops heavy rain over the Appalachian Mountains, with the risk of mudslides and flash flooding.Even before landfall, the storm's wrath was felt widely, with sustained tropical storm-force winds and hurricane-force gusts along Florida's west coast. Officials begged residents to evacuate.“Please write your name, birthday, and important information on your arm or leg in a PERMANENT MARKER so that you can be identified and family notified,” the sheriff’s office in mostly rural Taylor County, Florida, warned those who chose not to evacuate in a Facebook post. The dire advice was similar to what other officials have dolled out during past hurricanes.Beyond Florida, up to 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain had fallen in the North Carolina mountains, with up to 14 inches (36 centimeters) more possible before the deluge ends, setting the stage for flooding that forecasters warned could be worse than anything seen in the past century. Evacuations were underway in several areas of the state, and the sheriff's office in Haywood County declared all roads closed.School districts and multiple universities canceled classes. Airports in Tampa, Tallahassee and Clearwater were closed Thursday, and cancellations were widespread elsewhere in Florida and beyond.A day before hitting the U.S., Helene swamped parts of Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula, flooding streets and toppling trees as it brushed the resort city of Cancun and passed offshore. In western Cuba, Helene knocked out power to more than 200,000 homes and businesses as it brushed past the island.At one point, forecasters feared that hurricane conditions could extend as far as 100 miles (160 kilometers) north of the Georgia-Florida line. Overnight curfews were imposed in many cities and counties in south Georgia.Helene is the eighth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which began June 1. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted an above-average Atlantic hurricane season this year because of record-warm ocean temperatures.",Gov. Brian Kemp said at least 11 people in his state were killed and dozens are still trapped in homes damaged by Helene.

Netanyahu’s remarks came amid rising tensions following a year of conflict with Hamas , and new reports of attacks involving Iran-backed groups, including Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi forces.Netanyahu started his speech with clear intentions stating, ""Here’s the truth; Israel seeks peace, Israel yearns for peace, Israel has made peace and will make peace again.""In his address to the UN, Netanyahu rejected recent US-led efforts to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, making clear that Israel would continue its military campaign until all its objectives were achieved.“Israel has every right to remove this threat and return our citizens to their home safely. And that’s exactly what we’re doing ... we’ll continue degrading Hezbollah until all our objectives are met,"" Netanyahu said.He further criticised global leaders for ""lies and slander"" against Israel, stating that the ongoing conflict was reminiscent of the Holocaust.The prime minister reaffirmed Israel's stance on Iran , calling for the reimposition of sanctions to prevent Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Netanyahu issued a straight warning to Iran, saying, ""I have a message for the tyrants of Tehran; If you strike us, we will strike you.""He emphasised that Israel’s reach extended to “every corner of Iran and the Middle East.”Explaining about the situation with Lebanon, Netanyahu maintained that Israel was not at war with the Lebanese people, but with Hezbollah, which he accused of ""hijacking"" the country. He condemned the militant group for launching rockets from civilian areas, including schools and hospitals, while also vowing that Israel would not stop until its citizens in the north could return home safely.Regarding the war in Gaza, Netanyahu reiterated that Israel had no intention of resettling the territory but settle an establishment of a civilian administration focused on peaceful coexistence.He boasted of Israeli military achievements since the conflict began on October 7, claiming that the IDF had killed or captured more than half of Hamas' fighters.Netanyahu also reflected on the potential for peace in the Middle East, expressing hope for a future agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia. 'Israel was on the verge of historic diplomatic agreement with Saudi Arabia,' Netanyahu said.Despite the ongoing conflict, he pointed to the Abraham Accords with the United Arab Emirates as a model for peace and suggested that a similar deal with Saudi Arabia would benefit both countries' economies and security.The prime minister closed his speech with a scathing critique of the United Nations, describing it as a “house of darkness” where antisemitism and hypocrisy reign.Netanyahu said, “What hypocrisy. What a double standard. What a joke, its not about Gaza, its about Israel and its very existence.""He vowed that Israel would emerge victorious in its battle, stating, ""Israel will win this battle because we don’t have a choice.""Netanyahu’s speech heard some cheers from the public gallery, while several world leaders walked out in protest as he took the stage.After Netanyahu's speech the Israeli military claimed it had struck Hezbollah’s ""central headquarters,"" reportedly located beneath residential buildings in the Dahieh suburb of southern Beirut. This escalation followed multiple explosions in the Lebanese capital, where large plumes of smoke were seen rising from Hezbollah's stronghold.","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a fiery speech at the UNGA on Friday.

Pollster Nate Silver in his latest election forecast update said that the national polls are now in favor of Kamala Harris as the vice president is leading Trump by three percentage points, 49.1 per cent to 46.1 per cent. “A lot of polling since our last update, and the model mostly liked it for Harris — especially the national polls, which show her lead expanding to an even 3 points,” Silver wrote in the post published.“Forecast still in toss-up range, but we’re at a point where you’d probably rather have Harris’s hand to play.""In Kamala's winnability predicted by Nate's model, there were exceptions, notably in Arizona, Nate said adding that Arizona is unlikely to be the tipping-point state and a less critical swing state.

We will discuss everything and see what we can come up with,"" Trump said, boasting that he could bring about a peace deal even before he formally becomes president if he wins the November 5 elections.Zelenskyy barely got a word in edgewise, and when he mumbled about them having a “better relationship in the future,"" Trump said, “oh I see” and added ""it takes two to tango.""Trump's MAGA majors have been fuming about the Biden administration flying Zelenskyy on a US military plane to the US, and in their eyes, deploying him in Pennsylvania, a battleground state, where he visited an ammunition plant making artillery shells for Ukraine. They see this as election interference. Independent commentators see Zelenskyy doing a high-wire balancing act in the US, having to navigate a tricky political terrain and hedge bets on the outcome of the election by meeting Trump after his engagements with the administration.Kamala Harris meanwhile issued an oblique warning about Trump's approach to the Russia-Ukraine war after meeting Zelenskyy at the White House, saying ""there are some in my country who would instead force Ukraine to give up large parts of its sovereign territory.""""These proposals are the same of those of Putin. And let us be clear, they are not proposals for peace. Instead, they are proposals for surrender which is dangerous and unacceptable,"" she said at the White House after President Biden ramped up $ 8 billion in military aid to Ukraine.Both MAGA Republicans and Democrats bristled at the Trump-Zelenskyy meeting for different reasons although they recognized the exigencies. ""It takes immense courage for Zelenskyy to stand beside Trump, knowing he’s not an ally for Ukraine. You can see the discomfort on his face as Trump spins the narrative. He is a good man, willing to swallow his pride for the sake of his people, even when facing a Putin puppet,"" one Dem sympathizer noted.MAGA operatives meanwhile are agitated that US taxpayers are having to foot Ukraine's bill for the war. Their antipathy to Ukraine is part of a larger resentment about the purported US exploitation by NATO in their stand-off with Russia.

ISLAMABAD: At least 64 people have been killed this week in a fresh outbreak of violence involving the Pashtun Sunni and Shia tribes of Pakistan 's militancy-prone Kurram district along the Afghanistan border in the northwest, where a ceasefire had been signed just over a month ago.Governor Faisal Karim Kundi of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province said dozens on either side were wounded in the fighting, which continued Friday amid reports of higher casualties than the official figure.Police said the clashes started after the Boshehra Shias of upper Kurram started setting up bunkers on land belonging to the Sunni Ahmadzai community last week. The dispute quickly engulfed other areas and became a full-blown sectarian conflict , they said.In Aug, the warring sides signed a truce after clashes resulted in 50 deaths and injuries to over 200 people.Security officials said the renewed fighting led to closure of roads, triggering a shortage of food, medicines and fuel. Educational institutions have also remained shut for a week.Kurram, a mountainous area that shares a long border with Afghanistan, is home to about 700,000 people, of which more than 42% belong to the Shia community. The district's Parachinar town is one of the few Shia-dominated areas in largely Sunni Pakistan. The region has seen frequent tribal and sectarian clashes in recent years.","At least 64 people killed in fresh outbreak of violence involving Pashtun Sunni and Shia tribes of Pakistan's militancy-prone Kurram district.

The ICC prosecutor, who said he would visit Bangladesh by the end of this year, praised Yunus' three-point proposal to bring a new momentum to resolve the Rohingya crisis . Yunus proposed this at a meeting at the UN headquarters on Wednesday, when the ICC chief prosecutor also spoke.The proposal included an urgent conference hosted by the UN chief to review the overall situation and suggest ways out of it, an energised joint response plan for the Rohingya humanitarian crisis, and serious international efforts to support justice and accountability to address the genocidal crimes committed in Rakhine in 2017.""The three points are perfect,"" Khan said.","Interim govt and opponents of Hasina have charged her with in connection with the 700 deaths in the violent protests leading to her escape to India in Aug.
