MIRA/BHAYANDaR: MNS chief Raj Thackeray on Friday said if Hindi was made mandatory for Classes 1 to 5 in schools in Maharashtra, his party will “shut down schools”.Speaking at a rally in Mira Bhayandar , he referred to CM Devendra Fadnavis’s latest reported statement that the three-language policy will be implemented in the state.Earlier this month, the BJP-led govt withdrew its order making Hindi mandatory in primary schools following strong opposition by several organisations and political parties including the MNS and Shiv Sena (UBT) led by Raj’s estranged cousin Uddhav Thackeray. Speaking at the rally, Raj also said he was not opposed to any language, but would not tolerate compulsion.Raj warned the traders who had protested by holding a rally against the assault on a Mira Road shop-keeper by MNS activists that “there are Marathi traders as well and if we don’t buy from you, then what will you sell?”","MNS chief Raj Thackeray said if Hindi was made mandatory for Classes 1 to 5 in schools in Maharashtra, his party will ‘shut down schools’ He referred to CM Devendra Fadnavis’s latest reported statement that the three-language policy will be implemented.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122774185,imgsize-15346,width-400,resizemode-4/122774185.jpg"

KOCHI: Bitra Island, one of the 10 inhabited isles in the Lakshadweep archipelago, is set to be taken over by govt for defence purposes. There are 105 families on the island and many have opposed the move.Lakshadweep revenue department has issued a notification, dated July 11, for a social impact assessment (SIA). It stated that the intention was to transfer the entire island to defence and strategic agencies considering its “strategic location” and “national security relevance”.L akshadweep MP Hamdullah Sayeed alleged that the move was aimed at disrupting peace in the area and would be opposed tooth and nail.Lakshadweep MP vows to fight for Bitra islandersIn a video message, Lakshadweep MP Hamdullah Syeed asked Bitra natives not to worry or be anxious about the notification.“As your MP, we held a confer- ence that included leaders from Bitra and Lakshad- weep and discussed it in de- tail. We have decided to fight with the people of Bitra, po- litically and legally,” he said.Sayeed said govt had already acquired land required for defence purposes on several islands.Targeting Bitra, which has had an indigenous population for decades, without considering any alternative, is unacceptable. He also criticised the administration for not holding any consultation with the islanders.The notification said that a Social Impact Assessment (SIA) was needed as per pro- visions of the Right to Fair Compensation and Trans- parency in Land Acquisi- tion, Rehabilitation and Re- settlement Act, 2013.

NEW DELHI: A new development came in the Balashore self-immolation case, where the victim's friend on Friday claimed that the HoD threatened to fail her if she didn't fulfil his demands and accused the principal of provoking her to reach such an extent that she killed herself.The victim, a 20-year-old second-year B.Ed student at Fakir Mohan (Autonomous) College, Balasore, died after setting herself ablaze on July 12 outside the college gate during a peaceful protest that had been ongoing since July 1, demanding action against the head of the education department.The B.Ed student's friend Koshish Das also said that the HoD has been doing this for six months with her.""All of this was going on with her for six months... On 30 June, she told us that the HoD had stooped to the extent of telling her, 'I will fail you. I will keep you in this class for six years. You will not be able to leave this college till I am here.' Her backlogs were deliberately not being cleared. She was extremely depressed... She told us that she wants support to go and talk to the principal about this. We submitted an application to the principal, requesting immediate action..."" she said.Giving details about the July 12 incident, Das said, ""she wanted to speak to the principal... She kept waiting outside the principal's chamber, since there was a large crowd for admissions. We waited there for two hours, but then we told her, 'Let's have our lunch, and afterwards we can talk to the principal.' But before we could come back, we were told that she had lit herself on fire. By the time we got back, the college had been sealed, and I couldn't even see what condition she was in.

These students were in opposition to her (the victim), since she was in ABVP. She had become a political tool for these students, who wrote an application in which they assassinated her character, and submitted it to the principal.

'Time For Revival...': Russia's Big Unity Call To Rivals India & China | 'RIC Troika Will...'

(With inputs from agencies)

BEIJING/NEW DELHI: China on Thursday expressed its support for Russia’s initiative to revive the dormant Russia-India-China (RIC) troika.Russian news portal Izvestia on Thursday quoted Russia’s deputy foreign minister Andrei Rudenko as saying that Moscow expects the resumption of the RIC format and is negotiating on this issue with Beijing and New Delhi.“This topic appears in our negotiations with both of them. We are interested in making this format work, because these three countries are important partners, besides being the founders of BRICS,” Rudenko said.“Therefore, the absence of this format, in my opinion, looks inappropriate. In this regard, we expect that the countries will agree to resume work within the framework of the RIC — of course, when relations between these states reach a level that allows them to work in a trilateral format,” he said.In India, the ministry of external affairs said RIC is a consultative format where the three countries discuss global issues and regional issues of interest to them. “As to when this particular RIC format meeting is going to be held, it is something that will be worked out among the three countries in a mutually convenient manner,” said the spokesperson.Asked for his reaction to Rudenko’s comments, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian on Thursday said, “China-Russia-India cooperation not only serves the respective interests of the three countries but also helps uphold peace, security, stability and progress in the region and the world.”China stands ready to maintain communication with Russia and India on advancing the trilateral cooperation, he said.The Russian and Chinese interests in the revival of RIC followed the recent visit of foreign minister S Jaishankar to China to take part in the SCO foreign ministers meeting, during which he held talks with his Chinese and Russian counterpaerts Wang Yi and Sergei Lavrov.Joint work in the RIC format was stalled, first because of the Covid pandemic and then by the India-China military standoff at eastern Ladakh in 2020.","Russia's deputy foreign minister Andrei Rudenko says Moscow expects the resumption of the RIC format.

PATNA: The shooters involved in Thursday’s murder of gangster and murder convict Chandan Mishra in a Patna hospital while the 36-year-old was on parole were still at large even 24 hours after the brazen crime.Bihar police announced that they had identified all five shooters, including the main gunman Tausif Badshah, a resident of Patna’s Phulwarisharif well aware of Paras Hospital and acquainted with its security guards. While the shooters have been marked out from hospital CCTV footage and preliminary probes, their locations have not been traced yet, police said.Police said the murder appeared to have been orchestrated by Onkarnath alias Sheru Singh, a friend-turned-foe of Chandan currently serving life term for murder at Purulia jail in Bengal. “Sheru suspected Chandan had been informing the police about his members. Several of his associates were killed in the recent past,” a police officer said.Patna SSP Kartikeya K Sharma identified two other shooters as Monu Singh and Balwant Singh of Buxar -- Chandan’s home district. “The remaining two are also from Buxar but their names cannot be revealed now as it could affect the probe. Sheru seems to have orchestrated the entire conspiracy from Purulia jail,” the SSP said.Raids were conducted across Buxar on Friday. A suspicious SUV was stopped and three people detained but the cops could not find any evidence against them.","Bihar police announced that they had identified all five shooters, including the main gunman Tausif Badshah.

Pahalgam killers TRF a global terror outfit: US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pahalgam-killers-trf-a-global-terror-outfit-us/articleshow/122773903.cms,"File photo

India welcomes move

MEA: TRF ban timely, important, strong assertion of Indo-US ties

Pakistan on Thursday suffered the humiliation of having its latest terror avatar, The Resistance Front (TRF), responsible for the Pahalgam massacre, being designated a Foreign Terrorist Organisation by the US state department.TRF was also termed a “Specially Designated Global Terrorist” in concurrence with the US treasury department. In a statement, secretary of state Marco Rubio called TRF, whose existence Islamabad denies, a “front and proxy” for Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), a Pakistan-backed terror outfit responsible for numerous terror attacks in India, including the 26/11 Mumbai carnage that killed 159.In a separate notification published in the Federal Register, Rubio said based upon a review of the administrative record assembled in this matter, and in consultation with the attorney general and the treasury secretary, he has concluded that “there is a sufficient factual basis to find that Lashkar-e-Taiba uses the additional aliases The Resistance Front; TRF; Kashmir Resistance Front; and Kashmir Resistance”. The linkage endorsed India’s stand that LeT continues to re-invent itself in Pakistan under new names.The announcement by the US state department designating TRF a Foreign Terrorist Organisation not only strengthens India's case for a UN ban on TRF but also spotlights Pakistan-sponsored terrorism exactly when Islamabad is looking to corner India on the J&K issue, using its ongoing presidency of the Security Council (UNSC) to hold an open debate next week on unresolved disputes.External affairs minister S Jaishankar welcomed the development, calling it a strong affirmation of India-US counterterrorism cooperation and appreciating the role of his counterpart Marco Rubio and the State Department.Separately, the MEA said in a statement that this was a timely and important step as the TRF had been involved in numerous terror-related activities, including the Pahalgam terrorist attack for which it twice claimed responsibility. As a non-permanent member, Pakistan had earlier worked – with help from China – to dilute the UNSC condemnation of the attack.One of the things it insisted on was removal of the terror group’s name from the statement. Since 2023 – well before the Pahalgam attack – India had been sharing information with the Monitoring Team of the UN's 1267 Sanctions Committee, pointing to the TRF’s role as a cover for Pakistan based UN-proscribed terror groups like LeT and Jaish-eMohammed (JeM), for an international ban on the group.The govt is hoping that the US designation will bolster the case for TRF’s listing by the 1267 committee, even though it will be subject to approval not just by China but also, for now, Pakistan, a non-permanent member of the UNSC till the end of next year.“India has consistently emphasized the need for global cooperation in the fight against terrorism and the dismantling of terror infrastructure. The designation of TRF is a timely and important step reflecting the deep cooperation between India and the United States on counterterrorism,” said the ministry.The US ban on TRF is also the first real show of intent by the US under the second Trump administration to pin Pakistan down on the issue of cross-border terrorism. It follows multiple conflicting signals from Trump himself who made repeated remarks after India’ Operation Sindoor that seemed to equate India, which sees itself as the victim and not aggressor, with Pakistan.Trump, in fact, continues to maintain – much to the delight of Pakistan – that he mediated the India-Pakistan ceasefire, preventing a nuclear conflagration. “These actions... demonstrate the Trump administration’s commitment to protecting our national security interests, countering terrorism, and enforcing President Trump’s call for justice for the Pahalgam attack,” Rubio said in a statement, even as Islamabad is angling for a US presidential visit on the margins of the Quad summit in India later this year.Pakistan reacted with its customary denials to the terror designations, insisting it is a “frontline state against terrorism” despite legions of terrorists from Osama bin Laden to Khalid Shaikh Mohammed sheltering there and its nationals conducting numerous terrorist attacks across the world, including in the US.“Investigations into the Pahalgam incident… are still inconclusive. Any linkage with LeT, a defunct organisation banned in Pakistan, belies ground realities,” Pakistan’s foreign ministry said.","Pakistan's latest terror avatar, The Resistance Front (TRF), responsible for the Pahalgam massacre, was designated a Foreign Terrorist Organisation by the US state department.

Congress seeks 2 days to discuss Pahalgam

NEW DELHI: Ahead of Parliament’s Monsoon session, several Union ministers, including Rajnath Singh , Amit Shah, J P Nadda and Kiren Rijiju, on Friday strategised over the BJP-led govt’s stand on germane issues amid the opposition raising the heat on matters such as the revision of Bihar’s electoral rolls, Pahalgam terror attack and Operation Sindoor The strategy session of the group of ministers at defence minister Singh’s residence also comes ahead of the customary all-party meeting scheduled on Sunday. Though there was no official comment on the agenda of the Friday meeting, sources said it was related to the Parliament session. Union ministers Piyush Goyal and G Kishan Reddy were among those present at the strategy meeting. Singh is likely to chair the all-party meeting.Opposition parties have also been pushing the govt to bring a bill in Parliament on restoring statehood to J&K. On the special intensive revision (SIR) of rolls in Bihar, they have claimed that it is aimed at benefiting BJP. They have also seized on US President Donald Trump's claim of mediating the “ceasefire” between India and Pakistan during Operation Sindoor to attack the Modi govt. BJP and its Bihar allies have backed the SIR in the poll-bound state, asserting that it is aimed at ensuring that only eligible people are allowed to vote in the assembly polls and take welfare benefits.Ahead of the opposition’s meeting to chart the course for the coming monsoon session of Parliament, Congress said govt must allocate two days to discuss in Parliament the Pahalgam terror attack and subsequent events.The INDIA bloc will meet online on Saturday, while the Parliament session will get underway from Monday. Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said the Pahalgam terror attack issue is serious as the terrorists have not been arrested yet, while the claims of US President Donald Trump about the IndiaPakistan “ceasefire” have added a new dimension to the cessation of Operation Sindoor.He said the revelations by three top defence officials including the chief of defence staff and the remarks of Lt General Rahul Singh about China’s role, have made the subject “very significant”. Ramesh said PM Modi should make a statement on all the issues which will be raised in the Parliament session.

BENGALURU: In a faux pas, Meta’s auto-translation tool “digitally” killed off Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah while translating a condolence message posted by CMO on social media Tuesday. Understandably furious at being referred to as “late” CM, Siddaramaiah told Meta to suspend its Kannada auto-translation feature until it learns not to distort facts.The condolence message was posted in Kannada on Facebook and Instagram, mourning the death of veteran actress B Sarojadevi. Meta’s English auto-translation, however, read: “Chief Minister Siddaramaiah passed away yesterday multilingual star, senior actress B. Took darshan of Sarojadevi’s earthly body and paid his last respects.”Reacting sharply to the goof-up, Siddaramaiah posted on X: “Faulty auto-translation of Kannada content on Meta platforms is distorting facts and misleading users. This is dangerous when it comes to official communication. My media adviser has formally written to Meta urging immediate correction. Social media platforms must act responsibly.I caution citizens to be aware that translations shown are often inaccurate. Such negligence by tech giants can harm public understanding and trust.”The CMO said it sent a mail to Meta, seeking urgent intervention. The CMO also urged Meta to hit pause button on Kannada auto-translation until it improved the feature further. It also asked the tech company to collaborate with Kannada language experts and professionals “to enhance contextual accuracy” of translations from Kannada to English”.“We have noted with concern that the auto-translation from Kannada to English is frequently inaccurate and, in some cases, grossly misleading,” wrote K V Prabhakar, the CM’s media adviser. Prabhakar cautioned that such bloopers could cause confusion, especially when they involve public communication, official statements or important messages from the CM or govt. “Many may not realise that what they are reading is an automated translation rather than the original message,” he said.","The condolence message was posted in Kannada on Facebook and Instagram, mourning the death of veteran actress B Sarojadevi.

Melania Trump once praised Taylor Swift despite Donald Trump’s public jabs

At the same time, Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce shared a low-key moment in Ohio

A surprising ally in an ongoing political-cultural tug-of-war



In a surprising moment from summer 2025, Melania Trump broke ranks with her husband’s longtime criticism of Taylor Swift , offering rare praise for the pop icon. Her unexpected compliment came just as Swift enjoyed a quiet Ohio lunch date with Travis Kelce, creating a memorable intersection of politics, pop culture, and heartfelt romance away from headlines.In the summer of 2025, just days before America’s Independence Day celebrations, a moment of unexpected admiration made headlines — and it didn’t come from a Swiftie. During a visit to a Washington, D.C. children’s hospital, Melania Trump, often viewed as carefully distant from her husband's politics, offered a rare public compliment to pop superstar Taylor Swift, saying “She is very talented.”The comment, shared during a cheerful arts-and-crafts session with young patients, came at a particularly ironic time. President Donald Trump had just taken a jab at Swift on Truth Social, claiming she was “no longer hot.” The contrast between the former First Lady’s warm praise and her husband’s latest attempt to diminish the singer’s influence was impossible to ignore — and sparked a flood of online reaction. For a cultural figure like Swift, who has sparred with Trump over voting rights and women’s issues since 2018, Melania’s words felt like a small but symbolic gesture.While political commentary swirled, Taylor Swift stayed unbothered — finding joy far from the noise with her partner, NFL star Travis Kelce. Just as Melania's words were making waves, Swift and Kelce were spotted enjoying a quiet lunch date at Jojo’s Bar near Kelce’s hometown in Ohio. Bar owner John Ponicky later described their visit as “wonderful,” noting the couple’s down-to-earth charm and kindness.It was the kind of moment that defined the Swift-Kelce romance during that era — intimate, genuine, and removed from the Hollywood flashbulbs. Their relationship, built on shared admiration and mutual respect, often unfolded in places that felt more heartland than headline. Whether supporting each other’s careers or sneaking in peaceful afternoons in Ohio, they captured fans’ attention with simplicity and sincerity.As 2025 rolled on, Melania’s comment stood out for its timing and tone. Taylor Swift remained one of the most influential cultural voices of the generation — politically outspoken, fiercely independent, and firmly in control of her image. That someone from the Trump circle, especially Melania, would break ranks to acknowledge Swift’s talent was a quiet but notable departure.In retrospect, this throwback moment reminded us that even in the most polarized public spheres, admiration can surface in the most unexpected places — often without fanfare, just a soft-spoken truth shared with a child.Also Read: Are Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce halting Selena Gomez’s wedding?

Why did Trump sue?



What was in the 2003 birthday letter?



Epstein's death: Suicide or something more? Debate still rages







US President Donald Trump has filed a libel and slander lawsuit against Dow Jones, News Corp, two Wall Street Journal reporters, and the paper’s owner Rupert Murdoch.The legal action comes just a day after Trump threatened to sue WSJ after it released a report alleging he had sent a sexually suggestive birthday letter to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein in 2003.In a post on Truth Social, Trump himself announced that he has filed a 'powerhouse lawsuit.'""We have just filed a POWERHOUSE Lawsuit against everyone involved in publishing the false, malicious, defamatory, FAKE NEWS “article” in the useless “rag” that is, The Wall Street Journal,"" the MAGA supremo said.""This historic legal action is being brought against the so-called authors of this defamation, the now fully disgraced WSJ, as well as its corporate owners and affiliates, with Rupert Murdoch and Robert Thomson (whatever his role is!) at the top of the list,"" Trump added.The lawsuit was filed in the federal court for the Southern District of Florida, based in Miami. A full copy of the complaint has not yet been made public.The Wall Street Journal had reported that, in 2003, then-real estate mogul Donald Trump allegedly sent Jeffrey Epstein a birthday letter -- complete with a nude illustration, Trump's initials in a compromising place, and a reference to their shared “secret.”Furthermore, to calm anger among his Republican base over Epstein-related conspiracy theories, Trump has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the unsealing of grand jury testimony from the prosecution against Epstein.Bondi, in a filing submitted in New York, cited the “extensive public interest” in the case to justify the unusual legal step of requesting access to what is typically sealed testimony.MAGA bigwigs like US vice president JD Vance, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and right-wing commentator Laura Loomer all defended Trump after the WSJ report came into light.Trump and Epstein had a decade-long bond before parting their ways 15 years ago, as the US president claims.The leather-bound album, made for Jeffrey Epstein’s 50th birthday, has come back into public focus after WSJ said it had reviewed a copy that included a letter attributed to Donald Trump. The album was reportedly put together by Ghislaine Maxwell and included personal messages from several of Epstein’s well-known associates.According to WSJ, the page linked to Trump contains several lines of typewritten text, framed by the outline of a naked woman drawn in thick black marker. The report says: “A pair of small arcs denotes the woman’s breasts, and the future president’s signature is a squiggly ‘Donald’ below her waist, mimicking pubic hair.” The note is written as a pretend third-person conversation between Trump and Epstein. It ends with the line: “A pal is a wonderful thing. Happy Birthday – and may every day be another wonderful secret.”Epstein, who knew Trump and other powerful men for years, was found dead in a New York jail cell in 2019 while waiting for trial on charges of sexually abusing underage girls in New York and Florida. His death was officially ruled a suicide, but it sparked many conspiracy theories, especially among Trump’s far-right supporters, who believe in a global network of elite paedophiles.Democrats believe Epstein was murdered to stop him from revealing the names of more high-profile people involved in the scandal.Since returning to power for a second term in January, Trump has faced growing demands from his supporters to reveal what they believe is Epstein’s secret list of clients. However, Bondi appeared to close the door on that speculation with an official memo in July declaring that no such list exists.","US President Donald Trump has filed a libel and slander lawsuit against Dow Jones, News Corp, two Wall Street Journal reporters, and the paper's owner Rupert Murdoch.

Attorney Tony Buzbee blames mutual agreement for missing high-profile Las Vegas court appearance

Legal miscommunication or strategic legal posturing?

Public fallout and media retreat

The already controversial sexual assault lawsuit against NFL Hall of Famer and media personality Shannon Sharpe took another dramatic turn last week when the accuser’s legal team failed to appear at the initial court hearing in Las Vegas. The no-show left observers stunned and the presiding judge visibly disappointed—only for attorney Tony Buzbee to issue a statement days later that added more questions than clarity.“We are apologizing to the Court by letter for wasting the Court’s time,” Attorney Tony Buzbee told Pro Football Talk. “There was a mutual agreement among counsel to postpone the motion scheduled for July 9. As a result, there was no expectation by our team that her legal team would appear in person.”But the confusion only deepened when Judge Anna Albertson of the Clark County District Court reportedly “expressed disappointment” in court, per KLAS-TV, over Attorney Tony Buzbee’s absence. Shannon Sharpe’s attorney, Robert DeMarco, did attend the hearing and requested a 45-day extension to review the case, which the judge approved. The next scheduled court date is now set for September 3.Legal analyst Mike Florio of Pro Football Talk questioned the optics of the incident, writing, “It’s odd that Sharpe’s lawyers would have shown up for the hearing, if the hearing had been postponed.It’s odd that, if/when the judge expressed disappointment… Sharpe’s lawyers wouldn’t have said that the lawyers had agreed to postpone the hearing.”This latest development comes just over two months after a $50 million lawsuit was filed against Shannon Sharpe, accusing him of assault, sexual assault, battery, and sexual battery stemming from an alleged incident that occurred when the plaintiff was 19. Sharpe has categorically denied the allegations, calling them an “egregious attempt at blackmail,” and has threatened to countersue.While Sharpe initially remained on ESPN’s First Take following the lawsuit, he has since stepped away from the program. His legal team responded to the accusations by releasing explicit text messages and publicly naming the accuser. In turn, the woman responded with voicemails in which Sharpe allegedly issued threats.As the case heads toward its next hearing, the courtroom confusion and increasingly personal nature of the public battle suggest that this will be one of the most closely watched legal dramas involving a sports figure in 2025.Also Read: Shannon Sharpe’s sexual assault lawsuit spirals into courtroom chaos after accuser appears without lawyer","Attorney Tony Buzbee blames mutual agreement for missing high-profile Las Vegas court appearance.

Sports and discrimination can't go hand in hand. Sports ask to expand the horizon, not to shrink it. But when it causes some unfair advantage to a section over others, discrimination might be the answer to settle for, no matter if that, in any way, can't sit well with athletes like Sadie Schreiner. The transgender woman athlete, however, isn't one to brood about that seething dissatisfaction in silence; she's, in fact, taking it to the next stage against Princeton University, New Jersey. The 21-year-old runner is charging a lawsuit.Reports suggested Princeton University barred the athlete from taking part in a women's race held on May 3 at the Larry Ellis Invitational. Officials allegedly informed Schreiner 15 minutes before the race kicked off that the event would be specifically restricted to females, not trans women.a Princeton official told Schreiner, as per the suit, typically leading it to the controversy that holds that official accountable to 'But there's another side to the story.

NEW DELHI: Amid the escalating war of words between Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray and BJP MP Nishikant Dubey, Maharashtra BJP MLA Sudhir Mungantiwar on Friday attempted to dial down the rhetoric, stating that no one can be allowed to “drown anyone in the sea” in a country governed by the Constitution.Reacting to the recent string of violent remarks — from Dubey’s “patak patak ke maarenge” to Thackeray’s counter-threat “Mumbai ke samundar mein dubo dubo ke maarenge” — Mungantiwar said, “Koi kisi ko samundar mein duba ke maar nahi sakta. In this country, we respect the Constitution. To safeguard it, there is no dearth of martyrs like Tukaram Omble. If someone goes to drown someone, there would be several police personnel who would stop you. ”His comments came shortly after Raj Thackeray on Friday hit back at BJP’s Dubey for allegedly threatening Marathi people.“A BJP MP said, ‘Marathi logon ko hum yahan pe patak patak ke maarenge.'

‘Obama admin aimed to usurp Trump’: DNI Tulsi Gabbard reopens 2016 election probe; vows to hand over all documents to DOJ,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/obama-admin-aimed-to-usurp-trump-dni-tulsi-gabbard-reopens-2016-election-probe-vows-to-hand-over-all-documents-to-doj/articleshow/122776084.cms,"Powerful people mentioned in the statement







US director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has called for the prosecution of former President Barack Obama and senior members of his administration.The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) has accused them of working together to hurt Donald Trump ’s win in the 2016 election and damage his presidency afterward.“We are turning over all documents to the DOJ for criminal referral,” Gabbard wrote on X. “Their goal was to usurp President Trump and subvert the will of the American people.”In a statement released Friday, Gabbard said there is ""overwhelming evidence"" showing that after Trump defeated Hillary Clinton, Obama and his national security cabinet ""manufactured and politicised intelligence"" to lay the foundation for what she described as a years-long coup attempt.“The issue I am raising is not a partisan issue. It is one that concerns every American,” Gabbard said. “The information we are releasing today clearly shows there was a treasonous conspiracy in 2016 committed by officials at the highest level of our government.”Gabbard announced that all related documents would be handed over to the department of justice for criminal referral, urging that “no matter how powerful, every person involved in this conspiracy must be investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law”.The statement names top officials, including then-DNI James Clapper, CIA director John Brennan, national security adviser Susan Rice, secretary of state John Kerry, attorney general Loretta Lynch, and FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe among those who participated in a high-level National Security Council meeting on December 9, 2016, at the White House. Gabbard alleges that this meeting was used to initiate a new Intelligence Community (IC) assessment at Obama’s request, aimed at blaming Russia for interfering in the election.According to Gabbard, before the election, intelligence assessments had concluded that Russia was “probably not trying … to influence the election by using cyber means”. An internal memo dated December 7, 2016 also stated, “Foreign adversaries did not use cyberattacks on election infrastructure to alter the US Presidential election outcome.”However, following the White House meeting, Clapper’s executive assistant reportedly directed agencies including the CIA, FBI, NSA and DHS to help prepare a fresh IC assessment on Russian interference, stating it was “per the President’s request”.Gabbard accused Obama officials of leaking “false statements” to media outlets like The Washington Post, falsely claiming that Russia had interfered to influence the outcome of the election. A final Intelligence Community Assessment released on January 6, 2017, reportedly contradicted months of previous findings.She claimed that this new assessment relied on sources that officials knew were unreliable or “manufactured”, such as the now-discredited Steele Dossier. Gabbard said that this led to a wave of consequences, including the Mueller investigation, two impeachments of Trump, arrests of high-level officials, and heightened tensions with Russia.“Their egregious abuse of power and blatant rejection of our Constitution threatens the very foundation and integrity of our democratic republic,” Gabbard said. “The American people’s faith and trust in our democratic republic and therefore the future of our nation depends on it.”Gabbard’s move comes amid growing Republican scrutiny of the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation, and follows the recent release of new intelligence records under her office.","US director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has called for the prosecution of former President Barack Obama and senior members of his administration.

Afghanistan was rocked by two more earthquakes early Saturday with a magnitude of around 4.0 on Richter scale, marking fifth such seismic event in the past week, according to the National Center for Seismology (NCS).The first tremor, recorded at 1.26 am IST, measured 4.2 on the Richter scale with a depth of 190 km. The second quake struck just 45 minutes later at 2:11 am IST, registering a magnitude of 4.0 and a depth of 125 km. Both events were located in the northern region of Afghanistan, based on NCS data.On Friday night, another quake measuring 4.6 also shook the region. Earlier in the week, two more quakes of magnitudes 4.7 and 4.3 were reported, making this the fifth seismic jolt since July 17.Afghanistan’s vulnerability to frequent and often destructive earthquakes stems from its location at the convergence of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. The Hindu Kush mountain range, in particular, experiences frequent tremors and aftershocks.The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) notes that Afghanistan remains highly prone to natural disasters including earthquakes, landslides, and seasonal floods. These events further strain communities already grappling with decades of conflict and limited infrastructure, making disaster response and recovery particularly challenging.","The first tremor measured 4.2 on the Richter scale with a depth of 190 km.

MAGA voices join in







Former Trump attorney Michael Cohen has cast serious doubt on the Wall Street Journal’s claim that US President Donald Trump drew a suggestive picture for Jeffrey Epstein in 2003.Cohen said that during 13 years working closely with Trump, he “never once saw him doodle. I never saw him draw a picture. In fact, I would be very shocked if Donald Trump actually can doodle."" He further claimed that the words and language on the alleged letter were not Trump's.Cohen also said that he is in favour of releasing the Epstein files, like most of the GOP base.Cohen’s comments come after the Wall Street Journal reported that a birthday album for Epstein’s 50th included a note from Trump.The note allegedly had “lines of typewritten text framed by the outline of a naked woman, drawn in thick black marker.” The Journal says: “A pair of small arcs denotes the woman’s breasts, and the future president’s signature is a squiggly ‘Donald’ below her waist, mimicking pubic hair.” It ended: “Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret.”Trump furiously denied the report during an interview with the Journal: “I never wrote a picture in my life.I don't draw pictures of women. It’s not my language. It’s not my words.”The MAGA chief launched a defamation suit against The Wall Street Journal, News Corp, and Rupert Murdoch. He also directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of 'any and all' Epstein files.High-profile MAGA figures swiftly backed Trump. vice-president JD Vance dismissed the story as “complete and utter bulls**t” while activist Laura Loomer called the letter “totally fake,” arguing, “Everyone who actually KNOWS President Trump knows he doesn’t type letters. He writes notes in big black Sharpie.”Charlie Kirk also expressed scepticism, stating, “This is not how Trump talks at all. I don’t believe it,” referring to the third-person style of the Journal’s quoted text.The alleged letter is part of justice department files on Epstein-related materials that have been at the centre of a political row. The DOJ closed its investigation in June, saying no new “client list” emerged, a decision that disappointed some Republican supporters and many Democrat adversaries who wanted greater transparency","WSJ reported that a birthday album for Epstein’s 50th included a note from Trump.

'Money isn't enough': 'America Party' crashes before takeoff; Americans want alternative but don't see Musk's party as option,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/money-isnt-enough-america-party-crashes-before-takeoff-americans-want-alternative-but-dont-see-musks-party-as-option/articleshow/122775476.cms,"Elon Musk launched the America Party on July 5

Polls deliver a Blow



Third parties, and their little to no chance of succeeding



The more they see Musk, the less they like him





Elon Musk’s plans to launch a new political party appear doomed before they’ve even begun, with multiple polls showing overwhelming public opposition and record-low favourability ratings for the billionaire entrepreneur.The so-called ""America Party,"" which Musk teased after a fallout with former buddy and US President Donald Trump, has been met with a major thumbs-down from the American public.According to a CNN poll, just 25% of all adults and 22% of registered voters support the idea of Musk forming a third party to rival Democrats and Republicans. A staggering 74% of adults and 77% of voters are opposed.These numbers suggest that Americans may be open to alternatives beyond the two major parties, but Musk is not the person they want leading that charge.The CNN poll is not alone in its findings.A separate poll by Quinnipiac University also showed that most people don’t support Musk’s idea of starting a new political party. It found only 17% of voters would consider supporting Musk’s new party. More than 77% rejected the idea entirely.Musk himself has become much less popular in the past few years. According to CNN’s data, just 23% of Americans view him favourably, while 60% view him unfavourably, giving him a net approval rating of -37 points.CNN put it: “That gives Musk a net favourable rating of -37 percentage points. Oof.”Although other polls have been slightly less harsh, the overall picture remains grim. “Musk is just the wrong guy to lead such a journey,” the report notes. “He is, as I said at the top, one of the most unpopular political figures in the country.”This marks a sharp decline from 2016, when Musk had a net favourable rating of +29 points, making him one of the most admired figures in the Bloomberg poll at the time.Historically, third-party efforts in the US have struggled to gain traction. No independent has ever won the presidency, except George Washington, but that was before the modern party system existed.In 1968, George Wallace was the last third-party candidate to win a single state in a presidential race. Since 1970, there have been over 13,000 congressional elections, and non-major party candidates have won just 24 of them. Most of those wins came from independents like Bernie Sanders and Angus King.Even Ross Perot, a billionaire like Musk, had a hard time. Despite gaining nearly 20% of the popular vote in the 1992 presidential election and forming the Reform Party, the movement soon lost steam. Perot’s party reached its peak in 1998 when Jesse Ventura was elected governor of Minnesota. Today, the party is all but forgotten.Back in 1993, a CNN poll found that 50% of Americans supported Perot’s third party, while 37% opposed. In stark contrast, Musk faces 77% of Americans opposing his party from the outset.Even with poor poll numbers, Musk’s political plans still grab attention because of his huge wealth and influence. Unlike most other third-party candidates, he has the money to run big campaigns and get media coverage.“Many third parties fail because they can’t get their message out. Musk’s party wouldn’t have that problem,” CNN noted. “But money isn’t enough.”Adding to his challenges is the fact that Musk is ineligible to run for president, having been born in South Africa.“The more Americans see of Musk in politics, the less they like him,” CNN said. “Musk’s unpopularity makes the normally very difficult efforts to start a third party become herculean.”","Elon Musk launched the America Party on July 5, after a fallout with US President Donald Trump.

What did the WSJ report say?



Trump and MAGA allies hit back



The Epstein scandal







Media giant Rupert Murdoch, the man behind some of the world’s biggest news outlets, is back in the spotlight after US President Donald Trump filed a lawsuit against his company on Firday.The case stems from a recent Wall Street Journal report involving Jeffrey Epstein and a birthday letter allegedly written by Trump in 2003. Trump had reportedly asked Rupert Murdoch not to release or publish the article, calling it fake. However, the piece was published on Thursday, followed by a quick wave of attacks from the MAGA base.In a Truth Social post, Trump himself confirmed that he is suing Murdoch.""We have just filed a POWERHOUSE Lawsuit against everyone involved in publishing the false, malicious, defamatory, FAKE NEWS “article” in the useless “rag” that is, The Wall Street Journal. This historic legal action is being brought against the so-called authors of this defamation, the now fully disgraced WSJ, as well as its corporate owners and affiliates, with Rupert Murdoch and Robert Thomson (whatever his role is!) at the top of the list,"" The MAGA chief said.Rupert Murdoch is an Australian-born American business tycoon renowned for establishing one of the world's largest media empires. He owns Fox News, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Post, and numerous media outlets in the UK and Australia.Though often associated with right-leaning coverage, Murdoch’s companies have occasionally drawn criticism from Trump and his supporters, especially when the coverage doesn’t align with their views. This isn’t the first time Trump has clashed with Murdoch’s empire, but the Epstein case has raised the stakes.Murdoch has had a complex relationship with Trump, promoting his rise in 2016, but later falling out over the 2020 election and its aftermath. Murdoch, 93, is one of the most powerful media barons in the world.The Wall Street Journal on Thursday published a detailed piece claiming it had reviewed a leather-bound birthday album created for Epstein’s 50th birthday in 2003. According to the report, the album was organised by Ghislaine Maxwell and included notes from Epstein’s high-profile friends. One of those notes was allegedly from Donald Trump.The WSJ said the page attributed to Trump featured “several lines of typewritten text framed by the outline of a naked woman, drawn in thick black marker.” The report added, “A pair of small arcs denotes the woman’s breasts, and the future president’s signature is a squiggly ‘Donald’ below her waist, mimicking pubic hair.” The note was said to be written in a third-person style, imagining a conversation between Trump and Epstein. It ends with the line: “A pal is a wonderful thing. Happy Birthday – and may every day be another wonderful secret.”Trump and several of his close allies responded quickly to the report. The GOP leader has denied any wrongdoing and launched a lawsuit against The WSJ and its parent company, News Corp, which is run by Rupert Murdoch.The lawsuit accuses the WSJ of defamation and claims the letter has been taken out of context or is possibly fake. Trump’s legal team said the article was part of a politically motivated attack. “President Trump never wrote such a message,” said a statement from his spokesperson. “This is another disgusting smear from the corrupt media.”Supporters in the MAGA movement, including JD Vance, Karoline Leavitt, Laura Loomer, have also flooded social media, calling for an investigation into how the Journal got access to the letter and demanding that Murdoch be held accountable.Jeffrey Epstein was a financier and convicted sex offender who was arrested in 2019 on charges of running a sex-trafficking ring involving underage girls. He had close ties with many wealthy and powerful men, including Trump, former US prez Bill Clinton, and Britain’s Prince Andrew.Epstein died in a New York jail cell while awaiting trial. His death was officially ruled a suicide, but it has sparked years of conspiracy theories, particularly among both the left and right. Some Democrats believe he was murdered to prevent him from naming others. Trump’s base often claims Epstein was part of a larger elite pedophile network.The resurfacing of Epstein’s files, including flight logs, visitor lists, and personal messages, continues to keep the scandal in the news. The 2003 letter allegedly signed by Trump has now become another flashpoint.","Donald Trump has filed a lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch's media empire.

The White House Thursday announced that President Donald Trump has been diagnosed with a chronic but benign vein condition amid ongoing speculations over his bruised hand . The White House said the president sought a medical examination for swollen legs which came up with the new finding.""I know that many in the media have been speculating about bruising on the president's hand and also swelling in the president's legs. In the effort of transparency, the president wanted me to share a note from his physician ... all results were within normal limits,"" White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said.""Recent photos of the president have shown minor bruising on the back of his hand. This is consistent with minor soft tissue irritation from frequent hand-shaking and the use of aspirin,"" Leavitt said. Leavitt said Trump decided to share the note on his new health diagnosis with everyone. The president underwent a thorough evaluation after noticing swelling in his lower leg. The condition is benign and common among individuals over the age of 70. Leavitt announced that there is no evidence of deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease.Explaining the bruises on Trump's back of hand, Karoline explained that this is because of minor soft tissue irritation due to frequent hand shaking and the use of aspirin which Trump takes as part of standard cardiovascular prevention regimen.The clarification from the White House came as a close-up of Trump's hand became the center of online chatter as his hand looked evidently bruised. The theory of handshaking was floated earlier too but it was dismissed by many experts.Dr Neal H Patel, a doctor at Providence St Joseph Hospital, told the Daily Mail earlier this year that shaking hands is unlikely to have caused the damage. “I see a lot of patients who are businessmen, and I’ve never really seen them getting bruising from too much handshaking,” he said. “I guess it’s possible, but that would really not be on my list of ideas of what causes it.”",The White House said the president sought a medical examination for swollen legs which came up with the new finding.

• Donald Trump’s name appears seven times in Jeffrey Epstein’s flight logs from the 1990s.• The flights involved his then-wife Marla Maples, their daughter Tiffany, and staff.• There is no evidence Trump flew to Epstein’s private island or was involved in criminal activity.• Trump and Epstein were socially close in the ‘90s but reportedly fell out in the early 2000s.It’s a question that has lingered in the public consciousness ever since Jeffrey Epstein’s sordid crimes exploded into global headlines: Did Donald Trump ever fly on Epstein’s infamous “Lolita Express”?Thanks to a tranche of declassified documents released earlier this year by U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi—including the full flight logs from Epstein’s private jet—the answer is now clear. Yes, Trump was listed on at least seven flights aboard Epstein’s plane. But the logs also complicate some of the more salacious speculation that has dogged him for years.The logs tell a story—but not the whole oneAccording to flight manifests released in February 2025, Trump is recorded as a passenger on several domestic flights aboard Epstein’s plane in the early 1990s. Notably, these flights include family members: his then-wife Marla Maples, their young daughter Tiffany, and a nanny.There are no flights logged to Epstein’s notorious private island in the Virgin Islands (Little Saint James), nor are there entries connecting Trump to Epstein’s international sex trafficking operations.Still, these entries confirm what was long speculated: Trump and Epstein were socially close in the New York elite circles of the ‘90s, often appearing at the same parties and clubs. In a now-infamous 2002 quote to New York Magazine, Trump said: “I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. He’s a lot of fun to be with... even said he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.”By the mid-2000s, however, Trump reportedly severed ties with Epstein. Multiple reports, including investigative timelines from Time and The New York Times, note a falling out—reportedly over a Florida real estate dispute. Trump has since claimed he banned Epstein from Mar-a-Lago, though the circumstances remain murky.During the 2016 and 2020 election cycles, Trump was repeatedly asked about Epstein. His campaign consistently maintained that he had no knowledge of Epstein’s crimes and was “one of the few” who had distanced himself from the financier early on. In 2019, after Epstein’s arrest, Trump told reporters, “I had a falling out with him a long time ago. I wasn’t a fan.”The declassified flight logs from 2025 have reignited public scrutiny, particularly on social media. But Trump’s 2024 re-election campaign—and now his second-term White House—have aggressively pushed back on suggestions of impropriety. His spokesperson Steven Cheung dismissed the log entries as “routine travel decades ago” and said Trump “never visited Epstein’s island, never engaged in any criminal behaviour, and never flew with Epstein after discovering what he was. ”However, critics say the presence of his name on the logs—even if innocent—adds to a pattern of proximity between Trump and men later convicted or accused of sex crimes, including Bill Cosby, R. Kelly, and Ghislaine Maxwell.To date, no criminal charges or credible allegations have tied Trump to Epstein’s sex trafficking operation. The released flight logs suggest a limited social association, concentrated in the early 1990s and mostly involving domestic flights with family. There is no indication of underage passengers accompanying Trump, no evidence of him visiting Little Saint James, and no direct link to the sexual abuse cases for which Epstein was convicted.Still, in a political environment dominated by conspiracy theories and mounting distrust in institutions, the optics are potent. Trump’s second term has already been marred by public anger over the abrupt firing of Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor who worked on Epstein-linked cases, and speculation that the Trump administration is trying to control the narrative around Epstein’s death and files.Much like his presidency, Donald Trump’s connection to Jeffrey Epstein is a story with loud headlines and fine print. The records confirm they moved in the same elite circles. But as of now, the flight logs suggest association, not implication.A: Seven times, mostly in the early 1990s, including flights with Marla Maples and Tiffany Trump.A: No. There is no record of Trump flying to Little Saint James.A: Yes, they were socially close in the 1990s but reportedly fell out by the mid-2000s.A: No. He has not been charged or formally implicated in Epstein’s sex trafficking network.A: In 2025, Attorney General Pam Bondi released full Epstein flight logs as part of a broader declassification push, reigniting media interest.","Donald Trump was listed on at least seven flights aboard Jeffrey Epstein's plane.

"'Fired without reason’: Who is Maurene Comey, Manhattan prosecutor who worked on Epstein files and Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fired-without-reason-who-is-maurene-comey-manhattan-prosecutor-who-worked-on-epstein-files-and-sean-diddy-combs/articleshow/122663581.cms,"Maurene Comey (AP)

Who is Maurene Comey?





The US justice department has fired Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor in Manhattan and the daughter of the former FBI director James Comey, on Wednesday. The reason for her firing was not immediately clear.Comey had worked on several high-profile cases, including the prosecution of financier Jeffrey Epstein as well as rapper Sean “Diddy” Combs.Reacting to the firing, Maurene Comey said there was no reason behind her dismissal. “Yesterday was unexpectedly my last day in the Office. I was summarily fired via memo from Main Justice that did not give a reason for my termination,” she wrote in an email to colleagues, reported the New York Post.This comes as the administration is embroiled in a controversy after closing the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein.Maurene Comey was a seasoned attorney in the Southern District of New York, widely regarded as one of the Justice Department's most prestigious prosecutorial offices.She famously worked on the prosecution of financier Jeffrey Epstein, who died in custody in 2019, as he was awaiting trial.Comey achieved significant success in several high-profile prosecutions, most notably securing the conviction of Ghislaine Maxwell on sex trafficking charges for assisting financier Jeffrey Epstein in the abuse of underage girls.In a declaration submitted in January, Comey argued that releasing documents on the Epstein case could harm the government’s position on a potential retrial of Maxwell. She said that making the materials public might expose witnesses “to possible embarrassment and harassment” potentially discouraging them from testifying, as per the New York Times.Most recently, Comey led the prosecution of Sean “Diddy” Combs. The trial against Combs ended in a split verdict and he was convicted on prostitution related charges but acquitted of more serious charges.In recent months, Comey came under repeated attacks from Trump’s right-wing base, including Laura Loomer, a far-right political activist, who urged attorney general Pam Bondi to fire her in May.","Maurene Comey, the daughter of former FBI director James Comey, was fired on Wednesday.

New video shows Travis Decker 3 days before he allegedly killed his daughters





Newly acquired video footage from the Wenatchee police department shows Travis Decker, 32, the fugitive father, accused of killing his three young daughters, just days before their disappearance.The footage captures Decker speaking with a police officer and another individual on May 27. Decker rear-ended another vehicle at a red light, and the second person in the video was the driver of that car, reported CBS News.In the nearly 20-minute-long video, Decker and the other person were seen speaking to each other and the officer. Towards the end of the video, Decker and the other driver shook hands before returning to their respective vehicles. The audio could not be intercepted from the clip.The driver whose car Decker had hit said that he was “nervous and fidgety” and kept on asking him to “not call the police,” as per KING 5. “I could tell he was not in his full senses,” the driver added.Travis Decker has been the subject of an intense manhunt since June 2 after officials found the bodies of three of his daughters, Paityn (9), Evelyn (8), and Olivia (5), at a campground near Leavenworth, Washington State.The girls were on a “planned visitation” with Decker on May 30. Decker’s vehicle was found abandoned near the girls’ bodies and officials announced that the bloody handprints on the truck’s tailgate matched the DNA profile of Decker's.As per court records, Decker’s ex-wife raised concerns over his mental health, highlighting that he became increasingly unstable and was often living out of his truck. She also mentioned that he had been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder but was not under any medication.Decker served in the US Army from 2013 to 2021, including a deployment to Afghanistan in 2014, and received training in navigation, survival, and wilderness skills. Police stated that he is currently wanted on three counts of first-degree murder and three counts of kidnapping.A probable cause affidavit revealed that Decker fled the scene of a different crash on May 4, although the other driver declined police follow-up since their vehicle was undamaged.","New video shows Travis Decker 3 days before he allegedly killed his daughters.

‘Prayed for this day’: 10 Americans freed from Venezuelan prison in prisoner exchange programme; El Salvador releases over 200 Venezuelans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/prayed-for-this-day-10-americans-freed-from-venezuelan-prison-in-prisoner-exchange-programme-el-salvador-releases-over-200-venezuelans/articleshow/122773368.cms,"Image: X/@usembassyve





Ten Americans are on their way back to the US following a prisoner exchange involving the United States, El Salvador, and Venezuela, US secretary of state Marco Rubio announced Friday.As part of the prisoner exchange, more than 200 Venezuelan migrants, who were deported to a mega-prison in El Salvador by the Trump administration have left the Central American country and are set to be sent to Venezuela, reported ABC News.""Until today, more Americans were wrongfully held in Venezuela than any other country in the world, "" Rubio stated. ""Every wrongfully detained American in Venezuela is now free and back in our homeland,"" he added.Wilbert Joseph Castaneda, a former Navy SEAL is among the Americans who were released, as per CBS News. He was detained in Venezuela last year while he was travelling in the country for personal reasons.""We have prayed for this day for almost a year. My brother is an innocent man who was used as a political pawn by the Maduro regime,"" Castaneda’s family stated.Salvadoran president Nayib Bukele posted on X, “Today, we have handed over all the Venezuelan nationals detained in our country, accused of being part of the criminal organization Tren de Aragua (TDA).Many of them face multiple charges of murder, robbery, rape, and other serious crimes.As was offered to the Venezuelan regime back in April, we carried out this exchange in return for a considerable number of Venezuelan political prisoners, people that regime had kept in its prisons for years, as well as all the American citizens it was holding as hostages.These individuals are now en route to El Salvador, where they will make a brief stop before continuing their journey home,” he said referring to the release of Venezuelan migrants being detained in the infamous CECOT prison in El Salvador.The Venezuelans were transferred to El Salvador after the Trump administration invoked the Alien Enemies Act, an 18th-century wartime law allowing for the removal of noncitizens with minimal due process.Using the act, US authorities deported two planeloads of alleged migrant gang members by arguing that the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua functions as a “hybrid criminal state” attempting to infiltrate the US, as per ABC News.Many of the deportees' families and attorneys have denied their alliance with the gang and an ICE official stated in a sworn federal court declaration that numerous deported individuals did not have any criminal records in the US.The migrants were transferred to CECOT earlier this year under a $6 million agreement between the Trump administration and Salvadoran President Bukele, aimed at housing migrant detainees as part of Trump's broader immigration crackdown.","Ten Americans are on their way back to the US following a prisoner exchange involving the United States, El Salvador, and Venezuela.

‘Out of touch’: Mamdani's old prison remarks resurface; law enforcement slams NYC hopeful,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/out-of-touch-mamdanis-old-prison-remarks-resurface-law-enforcement-slams-nyc-hopeful/articleshow/122772663.cms,"Zohran Mamdani (AP)





New York mayoral front-runner Zohran Mamdani previously questioned the “purpose” of jails and prisons, drawing sharp criticism from law enforcement officials on Friday, who condemned the remarks as “out of touch” and potentially dangerous.“I think that frankly, I mean, what purpose do they serve, right?” Mamdani said in August 2020 when a co-host of “The Far Left Show” asked him whether he believed prisons were obsolete, reported the New York Post.“I think we have to ask ourselves that … I think a lot of people who defend the carceral state, that defend the idea of it and the way it makes them feel, they’re not defending the reality of it and the practices that are part and parcel of it,” Mamdani added.“Because if you actually break it down … how many people come out the prison system better than they went into the prison system?”The clip, which resurfaced on social media this week after being posted by the “End Wokeness” account and widely circulated in conservative circles, sparked backlash within the law enforcement community.In the interview he asked “how much harm is actually being prevented versus created” while referring to incarceration of offenders.“I think when you ask these kinds of questions, people don’t always have clear answers, what they always want to pivot to is ‘What are you going to do about murderers?’ and ‘What are you going to do about rapists?’ and sometimes you have to ask them, ‘What are you doing about them right now?’” he added.“It’s scary that a mayoral candidate could be this out of touch with the realities of living in communities that have historically experienced violence and crime,” a source said, as per the New York Post. “Sounds like he will change his tune once he realizes how unhinged that sounds in the real world.”“It’s the poor neighborhoods that the stalker, domestic abuser, and shooting recidivist will return [to],” said another law enforcement source. “But the rules of civil society that make this city the luxury item most of Zohran’s constituency want to live in is a product of that, bad people in jail so they can pretend they live on a movie set.”“Letting criminals walk the streets without any repercussions is not repairing anything,” said a Manhattan cop.Mamdani has previously expressed his stance on prisons stating, “White supremacy has many faces, from the police & prison systems in America to occupation & apartheid in Palestine,” he posted on X in 2020.GOP candidate Curtis Sliwa, who is set to face Mamdani in the November general election, denounced the resurfaced clip, calling it “absolutely preposterous.”“Of course we need jails to keep dangerous individuals off our streets,” Sliwa stated. “But he is no different than Eric Adams who is shutting down Rikers or Andrew Cuomo who pushed to close it while celebrating the shutdown of over 18 state prisons and passing laws that coddle criminals and let them avoid the jail time they deserve.”Zohran Mamdani has defeated Dormer governor Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary in New York City. The general elections are scheduled for November.","New York mayoral front-runner Zohran Mamdani previously questioned the “purpose” of jails and prisons.
