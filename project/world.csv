PANAJI: Goa police have said in a report to the state chief secretary that they were pressured by DGP Jaspal Singh to allow demolition of an Assagao house occupied by a Goan family in order to help Mumbai resident Pooja Sharma, a senior intelligence officer's wife, get the property vacated , reported.Besides instructing them to not take any action against Pooja, the report said the DGP threatened Anjuna police officers that if the ""demolition work"" was not allowed to continue they would have to ""face the consequences"".The report said when Anjuna police tried to stop the demolition, ""the DGP started shouting"" and said it should be demolished at any cost. He also instructed them that ""if any person is obstructing the demolition they should be brought to the police station"".In a chronology of events that transpired on June 22, the report said at 2.32pm, Anjuna police got a call from Panaji police control room that a person needs their help as “some persons are demolishing his house near Ganga tiles factory at Assagao”.Anjuna police sub-inspectors (PSIs) Sanket Pokhare and Nitin Naik rushed to the spot and found an excavator was demolishing the house — ground plus one floor. Pradeep Agarwadekar and his family, who were present on the spot, claimed that they were inside the house when they started demolishing.“Pokhare told the people to stop the demolition work, while asking the Agarwadekars to produce the documents of the house. He also directed the excavator operator to bring the vehicle to the police station,” the report said.While Anjuna police were carrying out their duty, they got a call from the DGP, “asking why the work of demolition of the house has been stopped”. When he was apprised about the situation, the report said, he got angry and said, “there was nobody inside the house when the demolition work was going as he has personally verified it”.The report said the DGP was pressurising Anjuna police to “take the occupants of the house to the police station and to allow the demolition work to continue”. Instead, Anjuna police instructed the Agarwadekars to come to the station and lodge a complaint.Pradeep Agarwadekar’s wife Prinsha along with her daughter came to the police station, while her husband and son stayed back at the site.The report said while they were at the police station, a person Arshad Khawaja came and told police that he was demolishing the house “as per the instructions from the top officer”. He told them that they would have received a phone call from the top officer.Khawaja also told them that he had received instructions to start the work again and said they could get in touch with him if they had any doubts. “Khawaja shared his mobile number.”The owner of the excavator, Ashley Rodrigues, also went to the police station and said Khawaja had told him that he has “contacts with top officials and that he (Khawaja) will manage all things on the spot”.The DGP called Anjuna police again and directed that “anyhow the work of demolition of the house must take place and no one should stop the work… to allow Arshad Khawaja to continue demolishing the house”.The Anjuna police report also said DGP Singh told them “Pooja Sharma is the owner of the property, and no cognisable offence is made out into the complaint of Prinsha Agarwadekar. Hence, there is no need to take action on her (Prinsha's) complaint”.","Goa police say they were pressured by DGP Jaspal Singh to allow demolition of an Assagao house occupied by a Goan family.

According to a complaint filed on Friday, Moore was pepper sprayed, had his face covered with a mask, and was left in a position that caused him to suffocate while in custody at a correctional facility.The incident occurred on Dec 8, 2023, when a group of guards from the Department of Corrections Emergency Response Team was conducting a sweep for contraband in one of the housing units.During the sweep, Moore was pepper sprayed twice and then placed in a spit hood, leg wrap, and restraint chair. He was then moved to a separate housing unit, where he was left in the hood, wrap, and chair for 30 minutes, despite multiple people hearing him say he couldn't breathe.

US supreme court rules in favor of January 6 rioters,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-supreme-court-rules-in-favor-of-january-6-rioters/articleshow/111349688.cms,"The US supreme court ruled on Friday that prosecutors overreached when charging January 6 rioters with obstruction for attempting to hinder the certification of the 2020 presidential election. The decision, which could lead to the reversal of numerous convictions, was made in the case of Joseph Fischer , a former police officer and Trump supporter who entered the Capitol alongside hundreds of others on January 6, 2021.Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for the majority, stated that the prosecutors' interpretation of the law would ""criminalize a broad swath of prosaic conduct, exposing activists and lobbyist(s) to decades in prison."" He emphasized that the government ""must establish that the defendant impaired the availability or integrity for use in an official proceeding of records, documents, objects, or other things used in an official proceeding, or attempted to do so.""The case was decided with a 6-3 majority, with Ketanji Brown Jackson siding with the court's conservatives. The dissent was authored by Amy Coney Barrett, a Trump appointee, and was supported by liberal judges Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. The case will now return to a lower court to determine if Fischer's indictment can be upheld under the more restrictive interpretation of ""obstruction.""According to the department of justice, 52 rioters have been convicted and sentenced on obstruction charges, with 27 currently serving time in prison. Attorney General Merrick Garland stated, ""The vast majority of the more than 1,400 defendants charged for their illegal actions on January 6 will not be affected by this decision.""The case centered on the interpretation of the word ""otherwise"" in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which was passed following the destruction of documents in the 2001 Enron scandal. The majority argued that the word ""otherwise"" gives prosecutors too much discretion, allowing them to pursue charges that go beyond the original intent of Congress. In her dissent, Barrett maintained that the joint session of Congress on January 6 was undeniably an official proceeding, and accused the majority of performing ""textual backflips to find some way -- any way"" to limit the scope of the relevant subsection.This case also has potential implications for Donald Trump , who faces four felony charges brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith related to his alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Trump is charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction of an official proceeding, and conspiracy to deny Americans the right to vote and have their votes counted. However, this case is currently on hold pending the supreme court's ruling on Trump's claims of immunity from criminal prosecution, which is expected to be delivered on Monday.","The US supreme court ruled on Friday that prosecutors overreached when charging January 6 rioters with obstruction for attempting to hinder the certification of the 2020 presidential election.

Vladimir Putin orders production of banned missiles after scrapping of treaty with US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/vladimir-putin-orders-production-of-banned-missiles-after-scrapping-of-treaty-with-us/articleshow/111349383.cms,"Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday called for the production of intermediate-range missiles, which were previously banned under a treaty with the United States that has now been scrapped.The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty, signed by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and President Ronald Reagan in 1988, prohibited ground-based nuclear and conventional missiles with a range of 500-5,500 kilometers (310-3,410 miles) and was considered a significant arms control achievement.However, the US withdrew from the treaty in 2019, citing Russian violations.During a meeting of Russia 's national security council, Putin stated, ""We need to start production of these strike systems and then, based on the actual situation, make decisions about where - if necessary to ensure our safety - to place them.""He noted that while Russia had not produced such missiles since the treaty was scrapped in 2019, the United States has not only been producing these missile systems but has also brought them to Europe for exercises in Denmark and announced their deployment in the Philippines.Since the treaty's termination, the US has tested missiles that would have been prohibited under the INF treaty. The Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun reported in April that the US Army's Pacific commander, Gen Charles Flynn, stated that such a missile would be deployed in the region by the end of the year, marking the first deployment since the treaty's end.The scrapping of the INF treaty was a significant event in the deterioration of relations between the US and Russia.The New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, which limits each country to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers, is the last remaining arms-control pact between Washington and Moscow. It is set to expire in 2026, and the lack of dialogue on establishing a successor deal has raised concerns among arms control advocates.Putin's statement comes amidst heightened tensions between Russia and the West over the conflict in Ukraine and concerns about potential nuclear attacks.In June, Putin addressed executives from international news organizations regarding Moscow's use of nuclear weapons, stating, ""We have a nuclear doctrine, look what it says. If someone's actions threaten our sovereignty and territorial integrity, we consider it possible for us to use all means at our disposal. This should not be taken lightly, superficially.""","The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty, signed by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and President Ronald Reagan in 1988, prohibited ground-based nuclear and conventional missiles with a range of 500-5,500 kilometers (310-3,410 miles) The US withdrew from the treaty in 2019, citing Russian violations.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111349415,imgsize-1299878,width-400,resizemode-4/111349415.jpg"
Trump's relentless attacks & falsehoods,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-relentless-attacks-falsehoods/articleshow/111349739.cms,"For most of Thursday night's debate, former Prez Trump verbally pummeled Prez Biden , painting his political opponent as an ineffective leader with a torrent of attacks that were frequently false, lacked context or were vague enough to be misleading.Trump went directly after Biden's personal character, calling him ""weak"" and little respected by global leaders who were ""laughing"" at him.He tried to accuse Biden of corruption, dubbing the president as a ""Manchurian candidate"" who was ""paid by China,"" a nod to frequent accusations of undue influence for which there is no evidence. He directly blamed Biden for a wave of immigrants ""coming in and killing our citizens at a level we've never"" seen, a hyperbolic claim that is not backed up by statistics. And in a wild misrepresentation of facts, Trump claimed falsely that Biden ""encouraged"" Russia to attack Ukraine, even though Biden has consistently tried to rally support for Ukraine.Trump's remarks during the debate were not different from the way he inveighs against Biden during his rallies. But the attacks were particularly striking given that Biden was standing mere feet away from him.

I don't think he knows what he said, either."" But Trump's most forceful attacks surrounded immigration . Trump invoked the idea of ""Biden migrant crime,"" claiming that Biden's lax border policy had allowed terrorists and criminals to cross the border illegally. He accused Biden of killing ""so many at our border"" by not curbing the surge of migrants, an assertion that he did not back up with statistics.Trump also went after Biden's profile on the world stage. He argued that Putin was ""laughing at"" Biden's leadership and at his failure to secure the release of WSJ reporter Evan Gershkovich. Trump also revived his accusations that Biden improperly received payments from a Chinese energy company tied with his son Hunter. There is no proof any portion of those payments went to the president.","Biden did get in a few licks though.

""Bad debate nights happen. Trust me, I know. But this election is still a choice between someone who has fought for ordinary folks his entire life and someone who only cares about himself.Between someone who tells the truth; who knows right from wrong and will give it to the American people straight — and someone who lies through his teeth for his own benefit. Last night didn’t change that, and it’s why so much is at stake in November,"" Biden posted.Biden's support marked a shift in the Democrat narrative which was in favor of an alternative candidate as soon as the debate ended, but hours later it threw its weight behind Biden -- making it clear that Biden will not opt out of the contest.Biden too -- in his rally in North Carolina-- acknowledged his age-related frailties and said he was aware that he was not a young man and could not debate as he used to, but he knew his job, he knew the right and the wrong, the 81-year-old made an emotional appeal to the supporters who were writing him off after the debate.Speaker Mike Johnson, meanwhile, said members of Biden's Cabinet should consider using the 25th Amendment to remove him from the office. “There’s a lot of people asking about the 25th Amendment, invoking the 25th Amendment right now because this is an alarming situation,” Johnson said. “Our adversaries see the weakness in this White House as we all do. I take no pleasure in saying that. I think this is a very dangerous situation.”“But it’s not just political. It’s not just the Democratic Party. It’s the entire country. We have a serious problem here, because we have a president who, by all appearances, is not up to the task,” Johnson said. “And these are very dangerous times. This is a very serious moment in American history. And it needs to be regarded and handled as such. And we hope that they will do their duty, as we all seek to do our duty to do best for the American people.”The 25th Amendment to the Constitution, which governs presidential succession, says that the vice president and a majority of the Cabinet may vote to declare a president “unable to discharge the powers and the duties of his office” and give the vice president the duties of acting president.",Biden's support marked a shift in the Democrat narrative which was in favor of an alternative candidate as soon as the debate ended.

ISS astronauts take cover as Russian satellite breaks into over 100 pieces in space,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/iss-astronauts-take-cover-as-russian-satellite-breaks-into-over-100-pieces-in-space/articleshow/111329140.cms,"What happened to the defunct Russian satellite?

How did this affect the astronauts aboard the ISS?

What is the risk associated with this debris?

How are space agencies responding to this incident?

What caused the satellite to break up?

What are the implications of this incident for future space operations?

Astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS) were forced to take cover as a defunct Russian satellite broke up into more than 100 pieces of debris. This fragmentation has significantly added to the growing space debris problem, posing a risk to space operations.Nasa confirmed that the debris from the Russian satellite breakup passed close enough to the ISS, triggering precautionary measures.The astronauts were directed to shelter in place as a safety measure. ""The crew followed standard procedures and moved to their designated safe areas,"" stated a Nasa spokesperson.The breakup of the RESURS-P1 satellite, an Earth observation satellite declared dead by Russia in 2022, occurred at around 10am am Mountain Time (1600 GMT) on Wednesday. The incident took place in low-Earth orbit near the ISS, prompting US astronauts on board to shelter in their spacecraft for about an hour. This event has reignited discussions about the need for international regulations and collaborative efforts to manage space debris.The defunct Russian satellite RESURS-P1 broke up into over 100 pieces of debris in low-Earth orbit. US Space Command confirmed that ""over 100 pieces of trackable debris"" were created immediately following the breakup.The debris field from the breakup passed close enough to the ISS to necessitate precautionary measures. Nasa's Space Station office reported that the astronauts were directed to shelter in their designated safe areas. They remained in their spacecraft for roughly an hour before resuming their normal activities.The debris field created by the disintegrated satellite is expected to remain in orbit for several years, increasing the likelihood of collisions with operational satellites and space stations. ""It's a wild west out there,"" commented a leading astrophysicist. ""The increased debris heightens the risk of disastrous collisions, presenting a real environmental problem.""Nasa and other space agencies are using space-tracking radars to monitor the debris. US Space Command and firms like LeoLabs have detected at least 180 pieces of debris. There are ongoing discussions about the need for international regulations to manage space traffic and mitigate the risks associated with space debris.There are no immediate details on what caused the break-up of the RESURS-P1 satellite. Analysts speculate it could have been due to an onboard issue, such as leftover fuel causing an explosion. Jonathan McDowell, a space-tracker and Harvard astronomer, remarked, ""I find it hard to believe they would use such a big satellite as an ASAT target. But, with the Russians these days, who knows.""This incident underscores the ongoing challenges faced by space agencies worldwide in maintaining safe operations in an increasingly congested orbital environment. The prospect of satellite collisions and space warfare has added urgency to calls from space advocates and lawyers for an international mechanism to manage space traffic.(With inputs from agencies)","Astronauts aboard the International Space Station were forced to take cover as a defunct Russian satellite broke up into more than 100 pieces of debris.

Kabul harbouring TTP leaders, claims Pakistan

NEW DELHI: Amid heightened tensions with the Taliban rulers in Kabul and under increasing pressure from China, the Pakistan government has approved a new military campaign named Azm-e-Istehkam, meaning ""Resolve for Stability"", to root out domestic terror threats and stem the activities of fighters crossing over from Afghanistan .Speaking about the new initiative, defence minister Khawaja Asif recently told the Voice of America that Pakistan was even willing to go as far as carrying out cross-border strikes to eliminate militant hideouts in Afghanistan -- a move that could potentially trigger a retaliatory move from the Taliban regime.There has been a spike in terror-related incidents in Pakistan ever since the Taliban stormed back to power in Kabul in August 2021 after the US suddenly withdrew from the war-torn country.Pakistan has seen nearly 1,000 casualties from almost 700 incidents of violence in 2023.Many of the incidents have centered around Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Baluchistan areas.Terror incidents in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have been of particular concern to the Pakistan government as they have resulted in the deaths of many Chinese citizens working on projects related to Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative.Attacks targeting Chinese installations and personnel have highlighted the stakes for Pakistan's key ally, China, which has invested $62 billion in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).China has come out strongly against the attacks and has sternly warned Islamabad that it must take strict and effective action or it would re-evaluate its investments and projects in the country.Pakistan has blamed the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) for majority of the attacks and has repeatedly asserted that the terrorist organisation's leaders are being given a safe haven in the border areas of Afghanistan.The defence minister's strong statement came on the day JUI-F Maulana Fazlur Rehman warned about the critical security situation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.Rehman has claimed that things have reached a point where even the police could not go out at night due to the presence of armed men. The TTP ended its ceasefire with Pakistan in November 2022.In an interview with Voice of America, Asif said Islamabad could strike terror havens in Afghanistan and it would not be against international law since Kabul had been ""exporting"" terrorism to Pakistan and the ""exporters"" were being harboured there.He said though the TTP was operating from the neighbouring country, its cadre, about a few thousand in number, ""are operating from within the country"" and blamed the previous Imran Khan-led PTI government for bringing militancy back.The minister also ruled out any chances of dialogue with the banned outfit, saying that there was no common ground.Speaking about 'Azm-i-Istehkam', Asif said parliament would be taken on board in this regard and the concerns of political parties would also be addressed.Dawn reported that in separate remarks to local news channels, the minister said Islamabad would ""stringently enforce international laws at its borders with Afghanistan"" to restrict the movement of smuggled goods.The media outlet reported him as saying that the decision would also ""thwart the infiltration of terrorists"".","Pakistan has approved a new military campaign named Azm-e-Istehkam, meaning ""Resolve for Stability"" The move is to root out domestic terror threats and stem the activities of fighters crossing over from Afghanistan.

However, he has secured relief in other cases, including £190 million reference and Toshakhana, and acquittal in the cypher case, according to Geo News report.Earlier in February, the district court had sentenced the PTI founder and Bushra Bibi each to seven years in prison after the trial court found their nikah to be fraudulent after Bushra Bibi's former husband, Khawar Maneka, approached the court against the couple's marriage.The district court had sentenced the PTI founder and Bushra each, to seven years in prison in February earlier this year after a trial court found their nikah to be fraudulent after Khawar Maneka, Bushra's ex-husband, moved the court against the couple's marriage.Khawar Maneka said that the marriage was solemnized during Bushra Bibi's iddat period, the time a woman goes into isolation after a divorce or her husband's death. Imran Khan and his wife then filed appeals, including the ones against their conviction and those seeking suspension of their sentences.Considering Khawar Maneka's repeated expression of no-confidence, the Islamabad high court (IHC), on Judge Arujmand's request, transferred the case to the court of additional district and sessions judge Muhammad Afzal Majuka.On June 25, the district and sessions court reserved its verdict on pleas against Khan and Bushra Bibi's conviction, after directions given by IHC to decide the matter of suspension of the sentences within 10 days, Geo News reported.The court had also given one month for the decision on the petition filed by the couple against their conviction. Meanwhile, Bushra Bibi had requested a decision on her plea filed in the sessions court seeking suspension of her sentence.The court will announce the reserved verdict on June 27 at 3 pm (local time) while the hearing on the couple's plea seeking annulment of their conviction in the said case will be resumed on July 2, Geo News reported.PTI has been awaiting a favorable decision as a major relief for Imran Khan, who has been acquitted in some cases or has been granted bail in others.

He said security forces had arrested two key militant commanders— TTP’s Nasrullah, alias Maulvi Mansoor, and Idrees, aka Irshad— and then showed a recorded statement of the former.In the video statement Nasrullah claimshe belongs to South Waziristan’s Sararogha tehsil and that he had worked from slain Baitullah Mehsud’s platform before joining TTP in 2007.He recalled that he had settled in Afghanistan’s Paktika province during the2014 military offensive in North Waziristan and had been working as an “emir” in TTP’s defence commission since 2023.He thenexplainedaplanhe had been briefed about in Jan 2024 according to which a BLA guide would take him to southern Balochistan by helping him cross the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan through Spin Boldak town. According to the militant, Bashir Zeb, commander of BLA Majeed Brigade, was complicit in the plan’s creation.Nasrullah alleged India’s intelligence agency R&AW was behind all this, that it wanted a BLA-TTP nexus, and that TTP bases be established in Khuzdar, Balochistan.“TTP chief Mufti Noor Wali Mehsudand the outfit’s defence minister, Mufti Muzahim, said we(TTP)and our friends(R&AW)have three objectives in establishing a foothold in Balochistan,” he claimed, adding: “Sabotaging CPEC projects, including targeting Chinese citizens; carrying out kidnappings for ransom to play up the matter of enforced disappearances so that intelligence agencies can be defamed; and spreading anarchy and frustration among the people by fomenting terrorist activities in Balochistan.”He claimed that Mehsud held meetings with R&AW agents at the Indian embassy in Kabul and that this was fully supported by the Afghan government.After showing Nasrullah’s video statement, Langau said, “The global community should have no doubt left that there is India behind all this.”He said that while TTP vowed to “introduce an Islamic system”, the BLA on the other hand was their “ideological opposite”. “Their nexus only means that their investor is the same who is using them from two angles,” he alleged. “If you look at the financial support or the intelligence of BLA and TTP, or their members sitting abroad, there is no doubt that RAW is funding them,” Langau alleged.","Minister Ziaullah Langau’s allegations came during a press conference in Quetta.

What they're saying

“A soft state can never gain the trust of investors,” PM Shehbaz remarked. “The responsibility of the fight against terrorism is the collective duty and the primary obligation of all state institutions. It’s not about you and me, it’s about us, we have to trample it together.”

""The campaign will be complemented by socioeconomic measures aimed at addressing genuine concerns of the people and creating an environment that discourages extremist tendencies,"" said a statement from Sharif's office.

Ihsanullah Tipu, a security analyst, noted, ""Pakistan views the use of active military force as the most effective approach to counter armed violence.""

Some analysts suggest that the operation's timing may also be influenced by domestic political and economic considerations. Asfandyar Mir of the US Institute of Peace said, ""With the election done and a government in place, and the economic situation stabilizing, Pakistani leadership probably feels confident to pursue a vigorous campaign.""

What is the main objective of

Operation Azm-e-Istehkam

?

The primary objective of Operation Azm-e-Istehkam is to curb the surge in violence and armed attacks within Pakistan. This includes addressing domestic security threats and dealing with armed fighters crossing over from Afghanistan. The operation also aims to implement socioeconomic measures to create an environment that discourages extremist tendencies.

Why now?

The timing of the operation is linked to a dramatic increase in violent incidents over the last 18 months. Most of these attacks have been claimed by the TTP , which ended a ceasefire in November 2022.

, which ended a ceasefire in November 2022. Additionally, recent attacks targeting Chinese interests in Pakistan have further underscored the urgency of a robust military response.

Pakistan has seen nearly 1,000 casualties from almost 700 incidents of violence in 2023. Attacks targeting Chinese installations and personnel have increased, highlighting the stakes for Pakistan's key ally, China, which has invested $62 billion in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ).

). Senior Chinese officials have also emphasized the need for improved security for Chinese nationals and investments in Pakistan.

How will the operation be different from previous military campaigns?

Unlike previous large-scale military operations that required mass displacement of local populations, Azm-e-Istehkam is not intended to be a kinetic large-scale military campaign. The focus will be on augmenting the efforts of armed forces with intelligence-based operations and legal measures to address terrorism-related cases. The operation is described as a “multi-domain, multi-agency, whole of the system national vision” for enduring stability.

What are the potential challenges to the success of this operation?

Security analysts highlight several challenges, including the transient nature of TTP bases in Pakistan and the risk of escalating tensions with Afghanistan if cross-border operations are conducted. Additionally, the lack of public support for security forces in provinces heavily affected by violence could hinder the operation’s effectiveness. There is also the issue of diverging approaches between Pakistan and China regarding the Taliban in Afghanistan, a report in AlJazeera said.

What has been the reaction of opposition parties to this operation?

Opposition parties, including the PTI, JUI-F, and ANP, have expressed significant criticism of the operation. They argue that it could worsen the volatile situation in border regions and have questioned the government's decision-making process, claiming it lacked sufficient consultation with parliament and local stakeholders.

How has China reacted to recent attacks targeting its nationals and investments in Pakistan?

China has expressed strong concerns over the security of its nationals and investments in Pakistan, urging the Pakistani government to take effective measures to protect them. Following attacks on Chinese engineers and installations, Chinese officials have reiterated the importance of security and the need to protect Chinese interests in the country.

Will the operation affect Pakistan’s relationship with Afghanistan?

The operation could strain already tense relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan, particularly if cross-border military actions are taken. The Taliban government in Kabul has consistently denied harboring TTP militants, and any escalation of military activities could complicate diplomatic relations further.

Since 2001, Pakistan's military has conducted many high-profile operations like ""Zarb-e-Azb"", ""Rah-e-Nijat"", ""Rah-e-Rast"" and many more against homegrown militants in border areas. It seems it's time for another military operation against militants in Pakistan. But the Pakistan military has failed to root out these militant groups time and again.However, under pressure from China, the Pakistan government has again approved a new military campaign named Azm-e-Istehkam, meaning ""Resolve for Stability."" This initiative, announced by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif after a review of the country's counterterrorism efforts, aims to address domestic security threats and the activities of armed fighters crossing over from Afghanistan.The operation comes amid heightened tensions between Islamabad and the Taliban rulers in Kabul.(With inputs from agencies)","Operation Azm-e-Istehkam aims to curb the surge in violence and armed attacks within Pakistan.
