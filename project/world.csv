Gandhi family 'stole' Sitaram Kesri's Cong presidency: PM,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gandhi-family-stole-sitaram-kesris-cong-presidency-pm/articleshow/124798627.cms,"**EDS: THIRD PARTY IMAGE** In this image received on Oct. 24, 2025, LoP in the Lok Sabha and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi pays tribute to former party president Sitaram Kesri on his death anniversary at the party office, in New Delhi.

NEW DELHI: PM Modi on Friday invoked the ""insults"" heaped on former Congress president Sitaram Kesri by the Gandhi family to accuse the party of denying rights to SCs and OBCs, as he launched his Bihar poll campaign attacking the opposition over backward-class welfare.Recalling Kesri's controversial removal in 1998 to make way for Sonia Gandhi, Modi said country would never forget how the family insulted the ""pride of Bihar"". ""This family stole Kesri's presidency of Congress,"" he said at a rally in Begusarai - a pointed twist on Rahul's charge of ""vote theft"".The PM's attack came on Kesri's 25th death anniversary. Earlier in the day, Rahul, along with Congress general secretary K C Venugopal, paid tributes to Kesri at the Congress headquarters on Akbar Road - ironically, the venue of his ouster as party chief.Kesri, a freedom fighter from the OBC Bania community, headed Congress from 1996 to 1998 and earlier served as Bihar PCC chief and party treasurer. When many in the party sought Sonia's elevation, veterans insisted Kesri be allowed to complete his term. But the Congress Working Committee appointed Sonia, claiming Kesri had resigned - a charge he denied. His removal under controversial circumstances reportedly saw his nameplate tossed away and the octogenarian forced out of AICC office.""This family locked Kesri inside a bathroom and threw him to footpath,"" Modi alleged.Kesri had taken over from P V Narasimha Rao after Congress lost power in 1996, but as Sonia decided to enter active politics ahead of the 1998 polls, loyalists pushed him out in what many called a ""coup"".Congress has denied any mistreatment of Kesri.

West Bengal Police Arrest Three in Connection with Durgapur Gang-Rape Case





BENGALURU: Bengaluru Rural police have arrested three youths in connection with the alleged gang-rape of a 27-year-old woman near Nelamangala Tuesday night. The survivor, originally from West Bengal, works as a beautician for weddings and other functions and lives with her husband and two sons.

""They accused us of possessing ganja and being involved in a flesh trade, and demanded Rs 1 lakh. They then attacked me and another woman with a cricket bat and a machete. My friend nearly lost consciousness, but I managed to resist. They gagged my younger son and my husband's friend, locking them in the toilet. Three of them dragged me to a room in the adjacent house and raped me. They also robbed Rs 25,000 and two mobile phones,"" the survivor stated in her complaint.Her elder son, who was outside at the time, contacted the police control room.

Gurdaspur: The family of trucker Jashanpreet Singh, who smashed into multiple vehicles , allegedly under the influence of drugs, and killed at least three people in California, is numb with shock and disbelief.""He was an 'Amritdhari (baptized Sikh)' who never took drugs or alcohol.

The atmosphere in the small house was heavy with grief Friday as news broke of Jashanpreet's arrest and the video of his truck barrelling into California traffic went viral.The 22-year-old took the 'dunki route' to the US but only to support his family back home, said relatives.Jashanpreet's father Kulwinder Singh, who works as a school bus driver, can barely speak as relatives and villagers visit to console the family.""Please help our boy. He went abroad only to build our future, not harm anyone,"" his mother said, in barely a whisper. Gurbaksh said the family's modest home was built through loans. Kulwinder spent nearly Rs 40 lakh, much of which he borrowed, to send Jashanpreet abroad - though illegally.""He wanted to work hard, repay the debt, and start a small business,"" said Gurbaksh, adding, as a baptized Sikh, Jashanpreet never touched drugs or alcohol. Farmer leader and social activist Ranjit Singh, who visited the family, urged both Centre and Punjab govt to take up the matter with US authorities.","Jashanpreet Singh, 22, allegedly under the influence of drugs, killed at least three people in California.

Did US Control Pak’s Nuclear Arsenal? CIA Insider Drops Big Bombshell on Musharraf, India and Terror

'US expected India to strike back after 2002, 2008 terror attacks'





Former CIA officer John Kiriakou has revealed that the United States provided millions of dollars to Pakistan under former President Pervez Musharraf , in effect “purchasing” his cooperation.He also claimed that Musharraf handed over control of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal to the US. ""When I was stationed in Pakistan in 2002, I was told unofficially that the Pentagon controlled the Pakistani nuclear arsenal, that Musharraf had turned control over to the United States because he was afraid of exactly what you just described (nuclear weapons falling into terrorist hands),"" Kiriakou told news agency ANI.Kiriakou also revealed that the US refrained from targeting Abdul Qadeer Khan, the architect of Pakistan's atomic bomb, after “direct intervention” by the Saudi government.""A colleague of mine was dealing with A Q Khan,"" Kiriakou said, as quoted by the ANI. ""If we had taken the Israeli approach, we would have just killed him. He was easy enough to find. We knew where he lived. We knew how he spent his day. But he also had the support of the Saudi government. And the Saudis came to us and said, 'Please leave him alone. Please. We like A Q Khan. We're working with A.Q. Khan. We're close to the Pakistanis...They named Faisalabad after King Faisal. Just leave him alone.""Kiriakou called this diplomatic pressure a major US policy failure, describing it as a ""mistake"" by Washington. ""This was a mistake that the US government made, not confronting A Q Khan head-on,"" he said.Khan was born in Bhopal in 1936, moved to Pakistan with his family in 1952 after Partition, and died in Islamabad in 2021 at the age of 85.Kiriakou said the US had expected India to retaliate after the 2001 Parliament attack and 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, but it did not. ""At the CIA we called the Indian policy strategic patience. The Indian government would have been perfectly within its rights to respond by striking Pakistan and they didn't. And I remember at the White House people were saying, wow, the Indians are really exhibiting a very mature foreign policy here. We expected the Indians to, to strike back and they didn't. And that kept the world from what might have been a nuclear exchange. Right? But India's gotten to the point where they can't risk strategic patience being misunderstood as weakness. And so they had to respond,"" he said.He added that Musharraf allowed the US to operate freely. ""Our relations with the Pakistani government were very, very good. It was General Pervez Musharraf at the time. And look, let's be honest here. The United States loves working with dictators. Because then you don't have to worry about public opinion and you don't have to worry about the media anymore. And so we essentially just purchased Musharraf.""Kiriakou said Musharraf allowed the US to operate freely. ""We gave millions and millions and millions of dollars in aid, whether it was military aid or economic development aid. And we would meet with Musharraf regularly, several times a week. And essentially he would let us do whatever we wanted to do. Yes. But Musharraf also had his own people that he needed to deal with,"" he said.He added that Musharraf maintained the support of the military while pretending to cooperate with the US on counterterrorism, but continued activities against India. ""He had to keep the military happy. And the military didn't care about Al-Qaeda. They cared about India. And so in order to keep the military happy and keep some of the extremists happy, he had to allow them to continue this dual life of pretending to cooperate with the Americans on counterterrorism while committing terror against India,"" Kiriakou said.","Former CIA officer John Kiriakou has revealed that the United States provided millions of dollars to Pakistan under former President Pervez Musharraf.

Within seconds, Barai pulled out a kitchen knife and began stabbing Yadav on the road, an eyewitness told TOI.""I was walking right behind them.

'

'Pakistan committed terrorism in India — and nobody stopped it'

'Pentagon once controlled Pakistan’s nukes'

'US-Saudi ties are transactional — oil for weapons'

NEW DELHI: Former CIA officer John Kiriakou has said that Pakistan ""cannot win a conventional war against India"" and needs to realise that nothing good will come out of fighting with India.In an interview with ANI, Kiriakou, who served 15 years in the CIA, including as chief of counterterrorism operations in Pakistan said, ""Nothing, literally nothing good will come of an actual war between India and Pakistan because the Pakistanis will lose. It’s as simple as that. They’ll lose. And I’m not talking about nuclear weapons, I’m talking just about a conventional war.""He added that Islamabad must ""come to a policy conclusion"" that provoking India only hurts its own interests.India has repeatedly maintained that it will not tolerate Pakistan’s nuclear blackmail and will respond firmly to any act of terrorism. Over the years, New Delhi has demonstrated this stance through decisive military actions — from the surgical strikes on terror launchpads across the LoC in 2016, to the Balakot airstrikes in 2019, and most recently, Operation Sindoor in May this year.Kiriakou claimed that during his tenure, the US pumped ""millions and millions of dollars"" into Pakistan under then-President Pervez Musharraf, effectively ""buying"" his cooperation.""Our relations with the Pakistani government were very, very good. It was General Pervez Musharraf at the time. And look, let's be honest here. The United States loves working with dictators.

And so in order to keep the military happy and keep some of the extremists happy, he had to allow them to continue this dual life of pretending to cooperate with the Americans on counterterrorism while committing terror against India,"" he revealed.Kiriakou alleged that Washington effectively ""bought"" Pakistan’s intelligence and military establishment with cash.""The US threw millions of dollars at Pakistan under Musharraf. We paid tens of millions in cash to Pakistan’s ISI"" he said, adding that corruption ran deep in the country while ""leaders like Benazir Bhutto lived lavishly abroad as common people starved.""Kiriakou said Pakistan’s support for terrorism against India was an ""open secret"" even during the 2001 Parliament attack and 2008 Mumbai attacks.Reflecting on the 2008 Mumbai attacks, he said, ""I don't think this is Al-Qaeda. I think this is the Pakistani-supported Kashmiri groups. That turned out to be exactly the case. The bigger story was that Pakistan was committing terrorism in India and nobody did anything about it.""Recounting his time in Pakistan in 2002, Kiriakou said he was told unofficially that the Pentagon had control over Islamabad’s nuclear arsenal at the time. ""Musharraf had turned control over to the United States. But over the last 23 years, Pakistan has insisted that’s not true — that their generals control the nukes,"" he said.However, he expressed concern about who truly holds power in Pakistan today, saying that political instability and the military’s influence make the country ""dangerously unpredictable.""Kiriakou on the US-Saudi relationship bluntly said that, ""Our foreign policy in Saudi Arabia really is as simple as we buy their oil and they buy our weapons. That's it."" According to him, ""almost the entire Saudi military is Pakistanis. It's the Pakistanis that protect Saudi Arabia on the ground.""Reflecting on global shifts, Kiriakou also noted that, ""We’re sitting on an ocean of oil. We don’t need the Saudis anymore. They’re hedging their bets, improving ties with China and India. The world is transforming before our eyes.""Kiriakou, who famously blew the whistle on the CIA’s torture program in 2007, said he spent 23 months in prison but remains unapologetic. He said he has ""no regrets, no remorse"" and ""did the right thing"".","Former CIA officer John Kiriakou has said that Pakistan ""cannot win a conventional war against India"" He added that Islamabad must ""come to a policy conclusion"" that provoking India only hurts its own interests.

West Bengal Police Arrest Three in Connection with Durgapur Gang-Rape Case

NEW DELHI: A 28-year-old woman doctor working at a government hospital in Maharashtra ’s Satara district has died by suicide, accusing a police sub-inspector of rape and a software engineer of mental harassment.The case has sparked outrage across the state, with chief minister Devendra Fadnavis ordering an immediate suspension of the officer named in her note and a thorough investigation.The doctor, who hailed from Beed district and was posted in Phaltan tehsil, was found hanging in a hotel room in Phaltan late on Thursday night. In a message written on her palm, she alleged that police sub-inspector Gopal Badane had raped her multiple times, while another man, Prashant Bankar, had mentally harassed her over several months.Police officials told PTI that the woman had called Bankar, who works as a software engineer in Pune, shortly before taking her life, and that the two had exchanged text messages. Investigators added that she lived as a tenant in a flat owned by Bankar’s father.Satara Superintendent of Police Tushar Doshi confirmed that a case of rape and abetment to suicide had been registered against Badane and Bankar. “The doctor’s body has been sent for post-mortem.We are also investigating the allegations mentioned in the suicide note on the victim's palm,” he said.Following the development, Badane was suspended from service. “The accused PSI has been suspended from duty with immediate effect. Police have launched an investigation into the case,” SP Doshi said.A relative of the doctor claimed that she had been under pressure from police and political figures to alter post-mortem and medical examination reports. “There was a lot of police and political pressure on her to make wrong mortem reports. She tried to complain about it. My sister should get justice,” her cousin told ANI.Maharashtra Women’s Commission chief Rupali Chakankar said, “We have taken cognisance of the matter and ordered Satara Police to take strict action against the accused.”Locals in her native village of Kotharban-Kavadgaon described her as “bright and ambitious”. “She was under pressure at work and that is why she took this extreme step. The culprits must be punished,” her aunt Prayaga Munde told PTI.","28-year-old woman doctor found hanging in hotel room in Maharashtra.

KOLKATA: Calcutta high court (HC) on Friday revoked interim protection against ""coercive steps"" by Bengal authorities that assembly opposition leader Suvendu Adhikari had since Dec 2022. Justice Jay Sengupta, while passing the order, held that ""any interim order by way of protection cannot continue for an unlimited period"". State administration can now lodge fresh FIRs against Adhikari without HC's nod.Justice Sengupta ordered the setting up of an SIT comprising seniors from CBI and state police to investigate several cases based on FIRs lodged against Adhikari. But the single-judge bench dismissed 15 other pending cases. The cases under investigation include an alleged job scam case registered in Kolkata; another was initiated following Adhikari's alleged threat to Tamluk cops.Another single-judge bench of Justice Rajasekhar Mantha had restrained the state in Dec 2022 from taking any ""coercive measures"" against Adhikari in 29 cases. Justice Mantha had also directed the state not to lodge any criminal case against Adhikari without the court's permission.A division bench of Justices IP Mukerji and Biswaroop Chowdhury had later observed that Article 361 of the Constitution provided blanket protective covers only to the President and state governors. But they told cops to seek the court's permission before taking any ""coercive steps"" against Adhikari and directed the state director-general of police to submit reports on FIRs lodged against Adhikari.The state then moved SC against Justice Mantha's order providing a ""blanket stay"" on FIRs against Adhikari. It, in turn, referred all pending cases against Adhikari to HC for final adjudication with directions to dispose of them expeditiously. Justice Mantha released all cases against Adhikari from his court following SC order.","Calcutta high court revoked interim protection against ""coercive steps"" by Bengal authorities.

Fadnavis struck 'deal' for Maoist surrenders,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/fadnavis-struck-deal-for-maoist-surrenders/articleshow/124797838.cms,"Turning point for Bhupathi came when wife surrendered

NAGPUR: Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis and Maoist ideologue Bhupathi engineered last week's mass surrender of People's Liberation Guerrilla Army members after a secret deal was hammered out through interlocutors, top govt sources said.Fadnavis reportedly ordered a go-slow on ops against rebels holed up in the tottering Maoist headquarters of Abujmarh after Bhupathi sent feelers for surrender. In secret messages over two months, Fadnavis offered safety, family reunions and jobs via govt programmes, including amnesty from UAPA and other criminal charges.The turning point came when Bhupathi's wife Tarakka, a top Maoist commander, surrendered in Jan, giving him the courage to bite the bullet. The deal with Fadnavis paved the way for PLGA cadres to come out of their jungle hideouts in both Maharashtra and Chh-attisgarh, changing the fight against Maoism in Dandakaranya region. Many members from Chhattisgarh's Rohi Dalam, too, crossed over to Gadchiroli to give up arms.Bhupathi's fear of fake encounters after surrender were allayed and this was supported on ground zero on Oct 14, when a battalion of C-60 commandos went unarmed to welcome guerrillas at Fodewada hamlet on the foothills of Abujmarh, before escorting them in a fortified bus to Gadchiroli police headquarters.This move of sending unarmed commandos to greet the guerrillas was tactical, but unprecedented, said the sources.During negotiations, Bhupathi promised to bring at least 500 weary tribal fighters out of the jungle. Fadnavis welcomed the move by allowing a calculated pause in operations in the garb of an informal monsoon break, while peace talks and strategies for a mass surrender were being hammered out.While Chhattisgarh continued its offensive against rebels, Maharashtra was in wait-and-watch mode. This allowed Bhupati to align with Fadnavis' vision of a peaceful end to hostilities which wou-ld save Dandakaranya and Abujmarh from bloodshed.During the pause, Bhupati stepped out of his Abujmarh hideout and started connecting with the tribal cadre, convincing them to return to the mainstream. This led to the surrender of over 350 Maoists in Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra at the behest of Bhupathi, with another 150-200 likely to return to the mainstream soon.On Oct 15, the Fadnavis-Bhupathi bonhomie was reflected during the official surrender ceremony at Gadchiroli police headquarters.Sources said Bhupathi had sent messages to Fadnavis on his intentions to surrender, but wanted him to be present on the occasion. The CM responded positively. ""I would have gone to the jungles to bring Bhupathi out...,"" Fadnavis told reporters after the ceremony.Sources stated these 500 PLGA fighters were moving swiftly, dodging security forces across the state's borders. ""These disenchanted tribals were fleeing on empty stomachs, ailing and injured, as their aggressive commanders, including Hidma and Devji, were urging them to fight to the last bullet. Bhupathi's bold move saved hundreds of tribal lives,"" said a senior official.",Mahar Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis and Maoist ideologue Bhupathi engineered last week's mass surrender of People's Liberation Guerrilla Army members.

NEW DELHI: India’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations , Parvathaneni Harish , on Friday called upon Pakistan to end the “grave and ongoing human rights violations” in areas “illegally occupied by it,” particularly in Jammu and Kashmir .Speaking at the United Nations Security Council ( UNSC ) open debate on ‘The United Nations Organization: Looking into the Future’, Harish reaffirmed that Jammu and Kashmir “has been, is, and will always be an integral and inalienable part of India.”“We call upon Pakistan to end the grave and ongoing human rights violations in the areas illegally occupied by it, where the population is in open revolt against Pakistan’s military occupation, repression, brutality and illegal exploitation of resources,” Ambassador Harish said during the session held on the occasion of the 80th UN Day.The envoy asserted that the people of Jammu and Kashmir “exercise their fundamental rights in accordance with India’s time-tested democratic traditions and constitutional framework,” adding that such concepts are “alien to Pakistan.”“Let me emphasise that the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir has been, is, and will always be an integral and inalienable part of India. The people of Jammu and Kashmir exercise their fundamental rights in accordance with India’s time-tested democratic traditions and constitutional framework.We, of course, know that these are concepts alien to Pakistan,” he said.Harish outlined India’s vision rooted in Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — the idea of the world as one family — which he said defines the country’s global outlook. “This is not only an outlook that anchors our worldview, but also the reason why India has consistently advocated for justice, dignity, opportunity and prosperity for all societies and peoples. It is also the reason why India places its faith in multilateralism, international partnerships and cooperation,” he said.Reflecting on the UN’s role since its inception, the ambassador said the organisation had become a “beacon of hope” for peace and decolonisation but now faces questions about its “relevance, legitimacy, credibility, and efficacy.”“The theme of this debate gains great salience at a time when the world’s largest multilateral organisation – the United Nations – faces questions related to relevance, legitimacy, credibility, and efficacy,” he noted.He added, “This organisation was founded in the aftermath of the Second World War as a beacon of hope for international peace and security. It advanced decolonisation; it has been instrumental in the emergence of new nation-states in the Global South; it drew up ambitious markers for economic growth, social development, and prosperity; it focused our minds on global challenges such as pandemics, countering terrorism and climate change. ”October 24 marks the anniversary of the entry into force of the UN Charter in 1945, after its ratification by a majority of signatories, including the five permanent members of the Security Council.","India’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Parvathaneni Harish, on Friday called upon Pakistan to end the “grave and ongoing human rights violations” in areas “illegally occupied by it,” particularly in Jammu and Kashmir.

The CJI cited SC’s 2015 judgment striking down the National Judicial Appointments Commission and said granting primary control over judicial appointments to the executive would imperil the independence and autonomy of the judiciary.Justice Kant said the judiciary’s dominant role in appointment of judges to HCs and SC is a compelling “illustration of the doctrine of separation of powers”. The judiciary’s independence and autonomy help it to go beyond simple resolution of disputes or defending constitutional boundaries; it has allowed constitutional courts actively “shape the democratic imagination of a society and to function as architects of democratic life”, he held.Justice Kant said that if separation of powers is the framework of India’s constitutional democracy, then judicial review — Article 32 (a person can approach SC directly over violation of fundamental rights) and Article 226 (a person can file a writ petition in an HC) — is the sustaining force of democracy.The ambit of judicial review extends to constitutional functionaries like EC, Lok Sabha speaker and governors, as well as legislative assemblies. “No act of governance is beyond the purview of judicial oversight,” he stressed.“This expansive power of review is a cornerstone of India’s constitutional democracy and a part of our basic structure, affirming that legality and constitutionality are fundamental preconditions to the exercise of public power,” Justice Kant said.In what reflects the judiciary’s transformative potential to give voice to the voiceless, Justice Kant said, judicial interpretation has resulted in expanding the scope of fundamental rights, leading to legislative action.CJI Gavai said that apart from the broad and purposive interpretation of Article 21 (right to life), SC has consistently held the state accountable for safeguarding and promoting the rights of citizens, compelling govts to translate constitutional guarantees into tangible actions.Public interest litigation (PIL) has evolved as an instrument for protecting human rights and the rights of marginalised and vulnerable communities like bonded labour, undertrial prisoners, migrant workers, manual scavengers, sex workers and pavement dwellers. SC has also brought in electoral reforms by acting on PILs, the CJI said.Justice Kant disagreed with criticism that judicial activism often results in encroachment of the turfs of legislature and executive, and said, “When courts act to empower the powerless, grounded in constitutional text and moral clarity, they do not usurp democracy, they deepen it.”Both the CJI and Justice Kant referred to SC’s landmark 13-judge judgment in the Kesavananda Bharati case in 1973 that established the doctrine of ‘basic structure of the Constitution’. “That judgment transformed the judiciary from a mere interpreter of the Constitution into its guardian,” Justice Kant said.","CJI B R Gavai and Justice Surya Kant, the next CJI, stoutly defended the much- criticised collegium system for selecting constitutional court judges.

Tejashwi formally declared CM face, Sahani named his deputy





Mukesh Sahani: From political exile to deputy CM face





Congress on shaky ground?





The weakest link?





NEW DELHI: The Mahagathbandhan on Thursday announced Tejashwi Yadav as its chief ministerial candidate and Mukesh Sahani as the deputy CM face ahead of the Bihar assembly elections. While Tejashwi’s candidature was widely expected, Sahani’s unexpected rise - from a one-time NDA ally often dismissed by rivals to a key power centre within the alliance has become the defining development, signalling a shift in the coalition’s caste arithmetic and leadership dynamics.Behind the show of unity, however, tensions simmer. As Sahani celebrates his political revival, Congress appears to be the uneasy partner in this new equation. Grassroots dissatisfaction over ticket distribution, coupled with its declining influence in seat-sharing talks, raises questions about whether the grand old party is losing ground within Bihar’s opposition bloc.The Mahagathbandhan formally announced Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader and former deputy chief minister Tejashwi Yadav as its chief ministerial face for the 2025 Bihar Assembly elections. Alongside, Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) chief Mukesh Sahani was declared the alliance’s deputy chief ministerial candidate.The announcement, made during a joint press conference of alliance partners in Patna, ended weeks of speculation over leadership and marked a new phase of coordination within the opposition bloc.Senior Congress leader and election observer Ashok Gehlot said, “All of us sitting here have decided that in these elections, we support Tejashwi Yadav as the CM face.”He confirmed that the Mahagathbandhan would contest the upcoming polls in complete unity, adding that Sahani would serve as Tejashwi’s deputy if the alliance comes to power.Mukesh Sahani’s recent elevation marks a remarkable political comeback. The Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) had originally been part of the Mahagathbandhan, but disagreements over seat-sharing—stemming from the Rashtriya Janata Dal’s reluctance to prioritise smaller allies—led Sahani to exit the coalition. He later joined the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and was allotted 11 seats in the 2020 Bihar elections. Although Sahani lost his own contest, his party managed to win four seats.Sahani was subsequently elected to the Bihar Legislative Council, albeit for a shorter term of one and a half years, which expired in July 2022.Once an NDA ally, Sahani faced political isolation after his fallout with the BJP. His decision to contest against the BJP in both the Bihar Legislative Council and Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections further marginalized him, with several VIP MLAs defecting to the BJP in 2022. In the 2022 Uttar Pradesh elections, Sahani announced plans to field 160 candidates to “oust the incumbent BJP government,” and in Bihar, he fielded 55 candidates against his former ally—but none won. Following these setbacks, a BJP MLA suggested that Sahani’s political chapter in Bihar was over, hinting at his removal as minister and even a potential internal coup within the VIP. Sahani also defied NDA seat-sharing arrangements in the Bihar Legislative Council elections, fielding seven candidates against the BJP once again.In 2025, however, Sahani has staged a political revival, now named the deputy chief ministerial candidate of the opposition bloc.Speaking to reporters in Patna ahead of the announcement, he appeared confident: “Why would I have a problem with anything? Can't you tolerate so much happiness on my face? Mahagathbandhan is moving forward very strongly.”His elevation seems a calculated strategy by the Mahagathbandhan to consolidate Nishad (fishermen) votes and appeal to smaller caste groups that have drifted away from the major alliances. The support base for the Vikassheel Insaan Party consists mainly of the Nishad, Nonia, Bind, Beldar community, which comprises 20 sub-castes of fisherman and boatmen. It also signals social inclusivity — a card the RJD-led bloc has traditionally used effectively in Bihar’s caste-driven politics.While the alliance celebrated unity on stage, discontent brewed within the Congress. In recent weeks, several party workers have expressed anger over the ticket distribution process, alleging bias and manipulation by senior leaders in charge of Bihar affairs.Congress worker Munna Shahi told ANI, “Those whom Rahul Gandhi had entrusted and sent here are from the five-star hotel culture, and they don't like to be brought down to poor ashrams here... We have only one demand, 'ticket chor, gaddi chod'... The selection process has lost its basis. Only eye wash remains now.”After the Congress CEC meeting on Bihar polls, another worker said, “It was said that those people who will be on the screening committee, those who will have their online application will be given tickets. But a few leaders like Krishna Allavaru and Rajesh Ram are making women work hard and go from door to door but cheating them at the end. The promise made by Rahul Gandhi, to honour the youth and women is being broken by Krishna Allavaru. We, the Congress workers, will not stand it. Bihar will not accept it.”Interestingly, on Thursday elevating Congress also replaced Allavaru as Youth Congress chief and brought in Manish Sharma.The internal tensions in the recent weeks by local leaders point to a widening gap between the Congress high command and its state unit. This recurring issue has hurt the party’s performance in multiple states.The Mahagathbandhan’s recalibrated leadership matrix leaves the Congress in an uncomfortable spot. With the RJD holding the chief ministerial claim and the VIP now rewarded with the deputy slot, Congress finds itself without a distinct bargaining chip. Its performance in the 2020 polls, where it contested 70 seats but won only 19, has weakened its ability to negotiate.The current configuration suggests a more RJD-centric alliance, with Tejashwi and Sahani symbolising the blend of legacy and new social representation, while Congress remains peripheral.The joint manifesto of the Mahagathbandhan is set to be released on October 28, after Chhath Puja, with Congress leaders Mallikarjun Kharge and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra expected to join the campaign. However, unless it manages to address internal dissent and project a clear message, Congress could risk further erosion in Bihar’s evolving political narrative.The Bihar assembly elections will be held in two phases on November 6 and 11, with results scheduled for November 14. The Mahagathbandhan — comprising RJD, Congress, CPI, CPI(M), CPI-ML, and Mukesh Sahani’s VIP — faces the NDA alliance led by BJP and JD(U), along with the Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) and HAM(S).",The Mahagathbandhan announced Tejashwi Yadav as its chief ministerial candidate for the 2025 Bihar Assembly elections.

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi spoke to his Malaysian counterpart Anwar Ibrahim and conveyed that he will virtually attend India-Asean summit Sunday, scotching speculation of a meeting with US President Donald Trump on the margins of Asean and East Asia summits in Kuala Lumpur.The ostensible reason for the rare miss to the summit by Modi might be preoccupation with Bihar assembly elections but it also spares him the discomfiture of running into the mercurial president in the middle of a US-India trade deadlock and growing differences over Pakistan-related issues.According to Ibrahim, Modi told him he would attend virtually “given Deepavali festival was still being celebrated in India at that time”. “I respect the decision and extend my Deepavali greetings to him and all the people of India,” said Ibrahim on X. In his own post on the same platform, Modi congratulated Ibrahim on Malaysia’s Asean chairmanship and conveyed best wishes for the success of upcoming summits.“Look forward to deepening of Asean-India Comprehensive Strategic Partnership,” said Modi. MEA later said in a statement that foreign minister S Jaishankar will represent Modi at East Asia Summit on Oct 27.In their conversation late on Wednesday, Ibrahim said India remains an important partner of Malaysia in trade and investment, technology, education and regional security sectors.Meanwhile, Congress on Thursday said the PM decided against visiting Malaysia to avoid “being cornered by Trump” and asked if this was the reason Modi did not travel to Egypt for Gaza peace summit helmed by Trump a few days back.Congress spokesperson Jairam Ramesh said Modi posting messages in praise of Trump on social media is one thing but to be seen hobnobbing in person with a man who has “claimed 53 times that he stopped Operation Sindoor and has claimed five times that India has promised to stop buying oil from Russia” is another matter which “is far too risky for him”.",The ostensible reason for the rare miss to the summit by Modi might be preoccupation with Bihar assembly elections.

Hakeem Jeffries throws weight behind Zohran Mamdani — Why it’s a big deal for Democrats and NYC politics,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hakeem-jeffries-throws-weight-behind-zohran-mamdani-why-its-a-big-deal-for-democrats-and-nyc-politics/articleshow/124793558.cms,"Why is Jeffries' backing of Mamdani a big deal?







House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on Friday officially endorsed Zohran Mamdani for New York City mayor, ending months of speculation about whether the top Democrat would back the socialist candidate or not.The endorsement came less than two weeks before the November 4 NYC mayoral election.In a statement to the New York Times, Jeffries acknowledged that he and Mamdani have “areas of principled disagreement,” but agreed to the fact that the Democratic Party must unite against what he called the “existential” threat from US President Donald Trump.“Zohran Mamdani has relentlessly focused on addressing the affordability crisis and explicitly committed to being a mayor for all New Yorkers, including those who do not support his candidacy,” Jeffries said.The 34-year-old Democratic Socialists of America member secured a surprising primary victory over former governor and rival Andrew Cuomo in June, but many national Democratic leaders initially hesitated to support him due to his far-left, anti-rich stance.The endorsement comes amid criticism from Republicans, who are using Mamdani’s socialist/leftist affiliation to target Democrats ahead of next year’s midterm elections.“Are there any moderate Democrats left? Every elected Democrat – in New York and nationally – must answer this question: do you stand with Zohran Mamdani or do you stand with the principles upon which our republic was founded?” New York GOP Chair Ed Cox said in a statement on Friday.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, another influential Democrat, has not publicly endorsed the candidate. On the opposite front, individual candidate Andrew Cuomo is backed by former Mayor Eric Adams. Republicans have also fielded a candidate, Curtis Sliwa, a red beret-wearing founder of the Guardian Angels, who is running as the Republican nominee in the NYC mayoral race.Hakeem Jeffries’ endorsement of Zohran Mamdani is seen as a major political moment, not just for New York City but nationally. Jeffries is the first African American to lead a party caucus in either chamber of Congress. He had been cautious about backing Mamdani due to his progressive platform and affiliation with the Democratic Socialists of America.His support signals a shift within the Democratic establishment toward embracing candidates from the party’s progressive wing. Analysts note that Jeffries’ endorsement may influence other moderate and centrist Democrats to rally behind Mamdani, helping to bridge divides between the party’s mainstream and its left-leaning members.The backing also carries national implications ahead of the 2026 midterms. Republicans have sought to tie Democrats to Mamdani’s socialist stances to portray the party as radical. Jeffries’ endorsement counters this narrative by presenting a unifying Democratic figure supporting the nominee despite ideological differences. The move strengthens Mamdani’s credibility with voters and party leaders, signalling that even cautious, mainstream Democrats see him as a viable candidate capable of leading the city while addressing key issues like affordability and inclusivity.",House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries officially endorsed Zohran Mamdani for New York City mayor on Friday.

Why Donald Trump is angry with Canada over a Ronald Reagan ad





But is the ad fake?









Ontario premier Doug Ford whose ad campaign is believed to be the reason that rankled US President Donald Trump to the point that he announced the end of trade talks with Canada, reacted to Trump's announcement and shared a full YouTube link to Ronald Reagan's 1987 radio address. In the address, Reagan speaks against tariffs and discuss the importance of free but fair trade.“Canada and the United States are friends, neighbours and allies. President Ronald Reagan knew that we are stronger together. God bless Canada and God bless the United States,” the premier wrote.After a few hours, Ford confirmed that he will pause the ad. ""Our intention was always to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build and the impact of tariffs on workers and businesses. We've achieved our goal, having reached U.S. audiences at the highest levels. I've directed my team to keep putting our message in front of Americans over the weekend so that we can air our commercial during the first two World Series games,"" he said.Doug's government launched the $75 million ad campaign earlier this month using clips of Reagan saying how he dislike tariffs. Trump said the ad was fake and Canada got caught cheating.Trump said Regan loved tariffs for the US and its national security. “TARIFFS ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO THE NATIONAL SECURITY, AND ECONOMY, OF THE U.S.A. Based on their egregious behavior, ALL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CANADA ARE HEREBY TERMINATED,” Trump wrote in a major setback for the Carney government who's trying very hard to come across as a stronger force than Justin Trudeau who was reduced to the status of a 'governor' by Trump.The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute also reacted to the ads, accusing the Ontario government of “using selective audio and video” clips and misrepresenting Reagan’s remarks.“The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute is reviewing its legal options in this matter,” a written statement from the foundation read.Experts have gone through the ad and the actual address of Reagan and found out that the as was not fake but edited.Ford had said earlier that they placed the ad on every major US network so that people get to know what Reagan used to think. “That ad, it’s not a nasty ad,” Ford said. “It’s very factual. And coming from a person like Ronald Reagan, every Republican is going to identify that voice.”'Liberal elbows gone'Opposition leader Pierre Poilievre mocked Carney for his earlier promise to negotiate a win with Trump. ""Mark Carney promised to “negotiate a win” with President Trump and to get a deal by July 21st. Still no deal. Still no win. Liberal elbows gone. US tariffs up. Jobs headed south,"" Poilievre posted.","Doug Ford's government launched the $75 million ad campaign earlier this month using clips of Reagan saying how he dislike tariffs.

West Bengal Police Arrest Three in Connection with Durgapur Gang-Rape Case

A Note On Palm

(With inputs from PTI)





NEW DELHI: A new twist has emerged in the alleged suicide of a 28-year-old doctor in Satara, Maharashtra , with reports that a MP had previously accused her over the phone of refusing to issue a fitness certificate to an arrested person, according to news agency PTI.According to PTI, the certificate would have enabled police to take the individual into custody and the doctor was reportedly targeted because she hailed from Beed district.The doctor, posted at the Phaltan subdistrict hospital, was found hanging in a hotel room on Thursday evening.She had reportedly checked into the hotel near the hospital late Wednesday night, as her rented residence was far away. Hotel staff found her body after she did not respond to knocks on her door.In a note written on her palm, she accused sub-inspector Gopal Badane of repeated sexual assault and software engineer Prashant Bankar, the son of her landlord, of mental harassment. A case of abetment of suicide has been registered against both.According to a statement she allegedly submitted to an internal inquiry committee, the doctor faced ongoing intimidation and harassment from police officials.She claimed she was pressured to alter post-mortem and medical reports and was taunted over crimes reported in her home district of Beed.One incident reportedly involved police trying to force her to declare a high-blood-pressure patient fit for custody, taking the woman away without treatment. Despite submitting a written complaint to the Deputy Superintendent of Police in June, no action was reportedly taken.Satara police said the doctor and Bankar had been in a relationship for five months, which later turned sour. Police also said her interactions with the sub-inspector were linked to her hospital duties, as she often handled medical examinations for suspects in custody.The sub-inspector is currently absconding. “We have suspended him and formed a special team to trace and arrest him and the other suspect,” said Inspector General Sunil Phulari.Political leaders have demanded a swift and independent probe. NCP leader Dhananjay Munde called for a special investigation team (SIT) and a fast-track trial, saying that ignoring her complaints due to her Beed origin would be a grave injustice. Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Ambadas Danve also demanded that officials from outside Satara conduct the inquiry, calling the suicide “a case where protectors turned predators. ”The doctor’s relatives said she had repeatedly complained about police harassment and pressure to alter reports. Activist Nitin Andhale shared her purported statement online, highlighting the extent of alleged inaction and intimidation that may have contributed to her death.Satara superintendent of police Tushar Doshi confirmed that the doctor’s complaints and evidence such as WhatsApp messages formed the basis for filing FIRs under sections 64 (rape) and 108 (abetment of suicide) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.An inquiry panel is being set up by the civil surgeon to determine if hospital superiors acted on her complaints.Civil surgeon Yuvraj Karape said the doctor had joined the hospital on contract and was nearing the end of her second 11-month term.She often stayed in the hotel after late-night duties, and authorities are examining all her complaints regarding police interference in post-mortems and other hospital work.","A 28-year-old doctor was found hanged in a hotel room in Satara, Maharashtra.

The Queen Mother Sirikit of Thailand, renowned for her rural development initiatives, traditional craft preservation and environmental protection efforts, passed away on Friday at age 93. She was the mother of the current King Vajiralongkorn and wife of the nation's longest-reigning monarch.King Vajiralongkorn has directed members of the royal family to observe a year-long mourning period, the palace announced.""I knew this day would come since she had been unwell for some time and was in her 90s,"" said 53-year-old housekeeper Sasis Putthasit in Bangkok on Saturday morning. ""But I didn’t expect it to be today,"" she told AFP. ""I feel sad because she was like a mother to the nation — and now she’s gone.""According to a palace statement, Queen Mother Sirikit had been hospitalised since 2019, battling several ailments, including a blood infection earlier this month. ""Her Majesty’s condition worsened until Friday, and she passed away at Chulalongkorn Hospital at age 93,"" the statement read.She died in a Bangkok hospital, where she had been battling a blood infection since October 17, with her condition steadily deteriorating despite medical intervention, as reported by Associated Press.Her public appearances had diminished in recent years due to health issues, following the death of her husband, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, in October 2016.Following the demise, Thailand’s Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul cancelled his trip to Malaysia ahead of Saturday’s ASEAN Summit, and could miss the signing of a ceasefire deal with Cambodia, which US President Donald Trump is expected to witness this weekend. A Thai government spokesperson, quoted by Reuters, said officials would discuss how to proceed with the ceasefire ceremony and whether another official should sign the agreement after PM Charnvirakul cancelled his trip. It remains unclear if Anutin will travel to Kuala Lumpur on Sunday.The Thai cabinet is set to meet Saturday morning to finalise funeral arrangements.Meanwhile, Palace-released photographs from her 88th birthday showed her receiving visits from her son, King Maha Vajiralongkorn, and other royal family members at Chulalongkorn Hospital, where she was under long-term care.Despite being less prominent than her husband and son, Sirikit commanded significant influence and public affection. Her image adorned Thai homes, offices and public spaces nationwide, with her August 12 birthday celebrated as Mother's Day. Her contributions ranged from assisting Cambodian refugees to forest conservation efforts.During Thailand's political upheavals, her role faced increased scrutiny. Her perceived influence during periods of military coups and street protests became a subject of discussion. Her attendance at a protester's funeral was widely interpreted as taking a political stance.Born into an aristocratic Bangkok family on August 12, 1932, Sirikit Kitiyakara's parentage had royal connections within the Chakri dynasty. She studied in wartime Bangkok before moving to France with her diplomat father.At 16, she encountered the newly crowned king in Paris whilst studying music and languages. Their relationship developed during his recovery from a serious car accident in Switzerland. Their courtship included his poetic gestures and composition ""I Dream of You.""Following their 1950 marriage and coronation, they pledged to ""reign with righteousness for the benefit and happiness of the Siamese (Thai) people."" The royal couple had four children: the current King Maha Vajiralongkorn and princesses Ubolratana, Sirindhorn and Chulabhorn.Initial years of their marriage involved international diplomatic missions, but by the 1970s, they concentrated on domestic issues including rural poverty, hill tribe opium addiction and communist insurgency.Their annual schedule included countryside visits and over 500 official ceremonies. The fashion-conscious queen engaged with rural communities, where elderly women affectionately called her ""daughter.""Despite urban speculation about palace politics and her lifestyle, she maintained rural popularity. Her SUPPORT foundation, established in 1976, trained villagers in traditional crafts. Her environmental initiatives included wildlife conservation projects and forest preservation programmes.She firmly believed in the monarchy's significance, stating in a 1979 interview: ""There are some in the universities who think the monarchy is obsolete. But I think Thailand needs an understanding monarch. At the call, 'The king is coming,' thousands will gather. The mere word king has something magic in it. It is wonderful.""","The Queen Mother Sirikit of Thailand passed away on Friday at age 93. She was the mother of the current King Vajiralongkorn and wife of the nation's longest- reigning monarch.

FULL: ‘NO HAMAS, NO UNRWA, NO PLAN B’: Rubio’s Shock Gaza Declaration From Israel HQ | Watch





A week after US President Donald Trump signed the Gaza peace plan in Egypt, Hamas said a committee of technocrats will take over governing postwar Gaza, representing several Palestinian factions.The groups said they had agreed to the arrangement after Hamas claimed to have received “clear guarantees” from mediators that “the war has effectively ended.”Hamas said in the statement that Palestinian factions agreed in a Cairo meeting to hand “over the administration of the Gaza Strip to a temporary Palestinian committee composed of independent ‘technocrats’, which will manage the affairs of life and basic services in cooperation with Arab brothers and international institutions”.The Hamas statement did not specify who would serve on the proposed Palestinian technocratic committee, which is expected to require US approval before taking shape.The statement also called for a meeting to “agree on a national strategy and to revitalise the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.”Hamas, which is not part of the PLO, is facing its longtime rival, Fatah, the group that dominates the organisation.This comes amid an appeal from Fadwa Barghouti, wife of prominent Palestinian leader Marwan Barghouti, who urged Trump on Friday to intervene for her husband’s release from an Israeli prison.In a letter to Trump, she asked him to push for his discharge. Marwan Barghouti has been serving multiple life sentences since 2002 for deadly attacks on Israelis but is seen by many Palestinians as a potential unifying figure for their national movement.Meanwhile, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement on Friday that Hamas “cannot be involved in governing Gaza in the future.”He added that all countries backing Trump’s plan, providing funding, personnel, or both, have agreed to this.He also said that “there is no plan B” for Gaza, only Trump’s broad peace plan, and warned that Israel’s annexation of the West Bank would “threaten the peace process.”Rubio also said Israel has fulfilled its commitments under the first phase of the 20-point Trump plan, which began with the ceasefire on October 10.He added that Israel would need to be “comfortable” with the composition of the international force set to enter Gaza during the second phase, which is still being finalized, as cited by the Times of Israel.",Hamas said a committee of technocrats will take over governing postwar Gaza.

Illegal Diwali fireworks sparked major house fires in both the United States and Canada this week, leaving families homeless and prompting renewed calls for tougher enforcement of fireworks bans.In New York state's Queens (South Ozone Park), a fire broke out around 2:25am on Wednesday after fireworks, believed to be part of a Diwali celebration, flew into a home and ignited flames that spread to three houses on Foch Boulevard and Lincoln Street, according to the FDNY, reported CBS News.Surveillance footage showed fireworks shooting directly into one of the homes before bright orange flames engulfed the area. “I was up and I smelled the smoke and saw the fire,” said neighbor Mohiuddin Saif. “Came running down, called my mother- and father-in-law… we basically all just ran outside at the same time.”Three people inside the first home managed to escape, though two were hospitalized, officials said. Neighbors described chaotic scenes as thick smoke filled the sky and heat melted exteriors of nearby houses.One resident, Juanita Colon, said her family lost everything.“We got nothing now because everything is ruined. My son has no clothes. We have to be in a hotel room living out of a hotel,” she told CBS News.Saif said he had called 911 around midnight to report people setting off fireworks in the street. “I was told that somebody would come and check. But then I was waiting, nobody came,” he said. “I did take some pictures, videos… then, I just went back to my bed.”Multiple 311 complaints were reportedly made about fireworks and noise before the fire. “It was all night, since 9 p.m.,” said neighbor Ruth Ragoonauth. “You can celebrate to a certain time, but why celebrate until 1, 2, 3 in the morning when people’ve got to get up early to go to work?” added Charlie Cuebas.By afternoon, the street was littered with melted vehicles, hollowed-out homes, and leftover boxes of fireworks. “It’s crazy, it’s totally gone,” a resident said. “At least they were able to get out. That’s the most important thing, their life.”A similar incident was reported in Edmonton, Canada, where a family also lost their home after alleged illegal Diwali fireworks set it ablaze, as permits are required within city limits.Edmonton fire rescue estimated damages at around $175,000, and police charged three people with arson, according to Yegwave. The fire also spread to a neighboring house.The homeowner, whose Millwoods residence was destroyed, said his family “lost their house” and called for tougher penalties against illegal fireworks use.Authorities in both New York and Edmonton have reiterated that fireworks are strictly prohibited without a permit, even during cultural celebrations such as Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights.","Illegal Diwali fireworks sparked major house fires in both the United States and Canada this week, leaving families homeless and prompting renewed calls for tougher enforcement of fireworks bans.

What to expect in Trump-Xi meeting

US-China ties





US President Donald Trump will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping on October 30, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in South Korea, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Thursday, reaffirming the meeting that had been questioned following an escalation in trade tensions.Leavitt informed reporters that Trump departs for Malaysia late on Friday night and will also visit Japan and South Korea. In South Korea, he is scheduled to meet Xi next Thursday after addressing the APEC CEO Summit.""On Thursday morning local time, President Trump will participate in a bilateral meeting with President Xi of the People's Republic of China, before departing to return home,"" Leavitt said.Trump on Thursday (local time) took a tough stance on China's alleged role in smuggling fentanyl into the US via Venezuela.He accused China of using Venezuela as a transit point for fentanyl, evading US and Mexican port controls. Trump, during a press interaction at the White House, stated that the first question he would ask the Chinese leader would be about fentanyl.""I'm meeting with President Xi... The first question I'm going to be asking him about is fentanyl. They make $100 million selling fentanyl into our country. They lose $100 billion with the 20% tariff.So it's not a good business proposition... It's one of the things we're talking about... They pay a very big penalty for doing that... We'll see what happens at the end of next week... I'm meeting with President Xi, actually, in South Korea. ..,"" said Trump.There is a lot at stake, so pressure is building on both leaders Trump and Xi to calm trade tensions that risk damaging the world’s two biggest economies.In this meeting, Trump is expected to crack a deal with Xi as he recently offered to lower tariffs on Chinese exports to the US but insisted that Beijing, too, had to make concessions, including resuming purchases of US soya beans, curbing the flow of ingredients used to make the opioid fentanyl – which has caused an overdose epidemic in America – and lifting restrictions on the export to the US of rare earth minerals, which are needed to manufacture hi-tech products such as smartphones, Guardian reported.Rare-earth stocks continue to be at the top of investors’ minds as the market weighs potential outcomes of a meeting between the leaders of the world’s two largest economies.A failure to reduce trade tensions could further harm US industries that are already grappling with the impact of Trump’s tariffs.The President was optimistic ahead of his meeting with Xi, telling reporters this week: “I think we’re going to end up having a fantastic deal with China … it’s going to be fantastic for the entire world”.Time is of the essence, however, as Trump and Xi’s meeting, yet to be confirmed by Beijing, is scheduled to occur just as additional duties of 100% on Chinese exports to the US are set to take effect.The leaders are also expected to discuss Taiwan, amid concerns that Trump might hesitate in Washington’s support for the democratic, self-governing island under pressure from Xi.Beijing has reportedly requested the White House to declare opposition to Taiwan independence – a move that would please China, which considers Taiwan a renegade province that must be reunified with the mainland.Trade tensions between the United States and China intensified in recent weeks following President Trump's announcement of 100 per cent tariffs on Chinese exports, set to take effect two days after the leaders meet.Trump's pledge followed China's announcement of newly imposed export controls on rare earth metals and related technologies in electronics and military goods.The new US tariffs would be “over and above any tariff” that China is already paying, Trump wrote in a social media post earlier this month. Trump added on Wednesday that his priority is to end Russia's war in Ukraine.Xi “would now like to see that war end,” the president said. It will be the first in-person meeting between the leaders since 2019, when the two met in Japan at the G20 summit, as per Politico.","US President Donald Trump will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping on October 30, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in South Korea.

The GOP government, MAGA bigwigs and senior federal officials have placed blame on Blue state California after an 18-wheeler semi-truck crash killed three people earlier this week.The incident involved an undocumented immigrant named Jashanpreet Singh, whose commercial driver’s licence was issued despite federal restrictions.US President Donald Trump’s Transportation Secretary, Sean Duffy, released a report Thursday accusing California of violating federal law by issuing a commercial driver’s license to Indian-origin Jashanpreet Singh.The 21-year-old Singh allegedly caused a crash on the I-10 Freeway while under the influence of drugs. The incident left three people dead, including a Pomona High School basketball coach and his wife, and four others injured.Duffy said California ignored a federal order to halt noncompliant licences and revoke improperly issued credentials, claiming the failure cost ""three innocent souls."" He added, ""My prayers are with the families of the victims of this tragedy. It would have never happened if Gavin Newsom had followed our new rules.California broke the law and now three people are dead and two are hospitalised. These people deserve justice. There will be consequences.""The Department of Transportation’s 2025 Annual Program Review and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) found flaws in California’s system for licensing non-domiciled commercial drivers, reports Fox News. The audit revealed ""systemic policy, procedural, and programming errors,"" including licences that remained valid after federal work authorisation expired.Singh’s licence was issued on June 27, 2025, and federal investigators flagged compliance failures on September 26. Despite a federal emergency rule limiting eligibility to drivers with certain employment-based visas, California upgraded Singh’s licence on October 15. The FMCSA review found more than one-fourth of sampled non-domiciled licences in California were incorrectly issued, prompting an order to halt new licences and review existing ones under threat of losing up to $160 million in federal highway funding.Dashcam footage from the crash showed Singh’s truck colliding with a white SUV, pushing a red sedan into a fireball, and striking other vehicles and utility trucks before coming to a stop.Singh illegally entered the United States via the southern border in March 2022 and was released pending an immigration hearing under former President Joe Biden’s alternatives-to-detention policy.

Donald Trump’s son hits back at Chelsea Clinton over White House demolition: ‘Your parents stole furniture’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trumps-son-hits-back-at-chelsea-clinton-over-white-house-demolition-your-parents-stole-furniture/articleshow/124794717.cms,"Chelsea Clinton condemns Trump’s ‘erasure of history’

Trump Jr. revives old Clinton controversy



White House demolition sparks wider outrage



Political families, old rivalries





A fresh political feud has erupted between two of America’s most prominent political dynasties after Donald Trump Jr. fired back at Chelsea Clinton over her criticism of President Trump’s controversial East Wing demolition. Responding to Clinton’s USA Today op-ed, which accused Trump of “erasing American heritage” by tearing down the historic wing to build a private ballroom, Trump Jr. took to social media with a sharp retort: “Lol, your parents tried stealing furniture and silverware from the White House… and let’s not talk about the intern. Sit this one out.” His post quickly went viral, reigniting decades-old tensions between the Clinton and Trump families.In her op-ed published earlier this week, Chelsea Clinton criticised what she called President Trump’s “pattern of destruction” — both literal and institutional. She argued that the East Wing demolition represents “yet another attack on America’s collective heritage, democracy, and the rule of law,” comparing it to Trump’s previous decisions to pave over parts of the Rose Garden, remove historic artworks, and “personalise the people’s house.Clinton wrote, “The erasure of the East Wing isn’t just about marble or plaster — it’s about President Trump again taking a wrecking ball to our heritage.” She warned that the project, which has already begun under tight security, reflects “a dangerous mindset that places ego above history.”The East Wing, traditionally home to the First Lady’s offices and hosting spaces, was demolished last month as part of what Trump described as a “necessary modernisation.” The President has announced plans to replace it with a multi-purpose ballroom and events hall, a decision that has drawn criticism from historians and preservationists.Donald Trump Jr.’s response, however, took the debate in a very different direction. His remark referenced a 2001 controversy in which former President Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary Clinton were accused of removing White House furniture and gifts worth over $28,000 when they left office.After media scrutiny and public backlash, the Clintons returned many of the items, later claiming that the removals were based on a misunderstanding of which pieces were personal gifts versus federal property. The General Services Administration (GSA) confirmed that several items were indeed government-owned and had to be returned.Trump Jr.’s jab, combining the “stolen furniture” reference with an allusion to the Monica Lewinsky scandal, served as a pointed reminder of the Clintons’ most damaging historical controversies. Within hours, his post had been shared widely on X (formerly Twitter), sparking fierce debate among supporters and critics alike.President Trump’s ongoing renovation of the White House complex has drawn mixed reactions from the public and preservation experts. The East Wing demolition follows earlier changes during his second term, including the removal of historic rose bushes planted during the Kennedy era, the installation of gold-trimmed interiors, and the relocation of several archival artefacts to private Trump properties.Critics argue that these moves reflect an attempt to reshape the White House into a personal legacy project. “This is no longer restoration — it’s reinvention,” said Dr. Margaret O’Leary, a Washington architectural historian. “The East Wing symbolised the softer, civic side of the presidency, often associated with the First Ladies. Its demolition carries deep cultural meaning.”The National Trust for Historic Preservation has expressed concern that many features of the White House, added after the Truman reconstruction of the 1950s, are being lost without adequate public consultation.The exchange between Trump Jr. and Chelsea Clinton revives a long-running political rivalry between two dynasties that have dominated American political discourse for decades. The Clintons’ prominence began in the 1990s, while the Trumps rose to political power in 2016 — both families defining opposing poles of US politics.Chelsea Clinton, who has largely avoided direct political office, has become a frequent critic of Trump policies, particularly on issues of democracy and historical preservation. Trump Jr., meanwhile, has emerged as one of his father’s most combative defenders, often taking to social media to spar with critics and frame attacks as partisan hypocrisy.Political observers say the latest clash reflects a broader partisan battle over American identity and legacy, intensified by Trump’s third-term ambitions and his ongoing cultural remodelling of national institutions.","Chelsea Clinton wrote an op-ed in USA Today condemning the demolition of the East Wing of the White House.

A ton of speculation swirled over how the MAGA chief would name his new venture after demolishing a perfectly fine historic building.

Trump Ballroom,"" and ABC News was told the name will likely stick.Trump has not publicly confirmed the name. When asked by ABC News Chief White House Correspondent Mary Bruce if he had decided on a name, Trump smiled and said: ""I won't get into that now."" The president has previously branded his construction projects with his own name, and this appears to be no different.The 90,000-square-foot ballroom is being built after the entire East Wing of the White House was demolished. A White House official confirmed that $350 million has been raised for the project, with construction currently costing $300 million. The official said Trump ""has received such positive and overwhelming support for the ballroom that he continues to receive donations"" but did not explain what would happen with the additional $50 million raised.When asked how much of his own money he would contribute, Trump replied: ""Oh, millions of dollars. Yeah. Well, I also give, you know, I give a lot of money to the White House. The White House is, as you know, I give my salary, and I usually like to steer it to the White House because this house was a little bit abandoned.""The new ballroom is part of Trump’s vision to leave a personal mark on the White House. It will be one of the largest additions to the East Wing in modern history when it's completed in 2026.Fundraising for the ballroom has exceeded expectations, with supporters contributing more than the projected construction cost. Trump’s decision to personally contribute millions reinforces his commitment to the project. The ballroom is expected to host events, ceremonies, and state functions, further cementing Trump’s imprint on the White House.","The 90,000-square-foot ballroom is being built after the entire East Wing of the White House was demolished.
