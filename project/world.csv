BENGALURU: Heavy rain induced by cyclonic conditions lashed large swathes of Bengaluru from Sunday midnight to early Monday, unleashing an average of 62mm of rainfall. The consequent collapse in the civic infrastructure led to the city's first rain-related death this year as a 56-year-old woman died avoiding a pothole in the city's tech corridor, Sarjapur .Hours before the accident, Sarjapur had recorded 40mm rainfall, drastically reducing visibility. The scooter-borne couple was returning from a family wedding on Monday morning when hit by a mini-truck. The rider had slowed down to negotiate huge potholes. They were knocked down by the mini-truck, leaving the woman pillion rider dead and her husband with injuries.Police identified the deceased as Mallika alias Baby from Nagawara, and her husband as Muniraju, who is now in hospital. A police officer said the woman would have survived if the road did not have potholes. Muniraju and Mallika were heading towards Sarjapur and stopped at a roadside eatery near Abhaya Circle for tea. The accident occurred when they resumed their journey. The truck driver abandoned the vehicle and fled. IMD has predicted rain for the next two days. The govt declared a holiday for schools on Monday, but the announcement didn't come too soon, leading to confusion as hundreds of school buses had already picked up children by that time.Heavy rain returned with a vengeance in the evening, with Chowdeshwari ward in Yelahanka receiving 150mm rain in 5 hours from 6.30 pm.At least 20 flights bound for Bengaluru landed late, between 9pm and 12 midnight, at KIA , while four flights were diverted to Chennai.","A 56-year-old woman died avoiding a pothole in the city's tech corridor.

NAGPUR: Captain Reena Varughese was a rookie pilot in 2009 when Maoists shot down a helicopter ferrying senior police and polling officials in Laheri on the fringes of Abujmarh, the 'People's Liberation Guerrilla Army' (PLGA) headquarters straddling Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh.Fifteen years later, Varughese knew what she was getting into when her 13-seater Dauphin-N Pawan Hans chopper took off from Gadchiroli and flew into the Maoist heartland, 100km away.Varughese and her crew's daredevil act of risking a mortar hit to rescue a wounded C-60 commando in the middle of Monday's eight-hour siege of the booby-trapped PLGA den was the defining moment of the operation in which five Maoists being killed.Sources said Varughese, who prefers being in the shadows, knew it was impossible to land on the rocky, forested terrain. Putting her co-pilot in charge, she jumped off the chopper as it hovered 11ft above the ground amid swirling dust.The chopper was a sitting duck for the Maoists, who are known to possess a fleet of unmanned drones to counter airborne raids. But Varughese and the crew pulled off what seemed impossible, lifting to safety the wounded C-60 commando who lay bleeding for three hours after taking three bullets.“Drawing from her experience in rescue and evacuation in high-risk zones, including Maoist-hit areas of Jagdalpur, Sukma and Chintagufa in Chhattisgarh, Varughese demonstrated uncanny ability in taking up the challenge head-on,” a source said. The wounded commando was flown to Gadchiroli within 30 minutes, from where he was taken to a Nagpur hospital, where his condition was reported to be stable till Tuesday evening. Varughese, who completed her BTech in aeronautical engineering before training to be a pilot, was part of the Pawan Hans operation to evacuate Covid patients from Lakshadweep Islands to Kochi during the pandemic.",Captain Reena Varughese was a rookie pilot in 2009 when Maoists shot down a helicopter ferrying senior police and polling officials in Laheri.

Despite crouching behind a broad tree trunk, Atram was hit thrice when he sought to give cover to his fellow commando. Atram bled profusely for 30 minutes before a fellow commando could bring the blood-clotting kit, stashed 50m away, in the midst of unceasing gunfire.Atram was part of the gun battle with the Maoists' ""Company Number 10"" formation in which five People's Liberation Guerrilla Army (PLGA) fighters were shot dead.The slain guerrillas had around 300 offences against them and carried a total bounty of Rs 38 lakh.

Sleuths probe if Delhi blast linked to row over ex-RAW officer Vikash Yadav,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/sleuths-probe-if-delhi-blast-linked-to-row-over-ex-raw-officer-vikash-yadav/articleshow/114443821.cms,"CCTV footage detects suspicious activity a night before explosion outside CRPF school

NEW DELHI: Investigators are probing if the blast outside the CRPF school in Prashant Vihar, Rohini, was carried out to send a message over the incident in which the name of ex-RAW officer Vikash Yadav has figured.Yadav is on the radar of pro-Khalistan elements after being accused of plotting the assassination of US-based terrorist G S Pannun.While the fact that CRPF is Yadav’s parent cadre and he was sent on deputation to RAW is the rea- son behind this suspicion, an analysis of the post made by a Telegram channel linked to a pro-Khalistani outfit has fuelled this theory, said a source.If an Indian agency thinks they can hire goons to target our members...they can’t imagine how close we are to them and how capable we are.” read the post.TOI had reported about the outfit claiming responsibility.Police said Monday that they had sent an official request to Telegram Messenger , seeking crucial information pertaining to the channels which disseminated the post and CCTV footage of the incident.Though authorities are exploring conceivable links to Khalistani elements, as a message bearing a “Khalistan Zindabad” watermark was circulated on the Telegram channel, accompanied by an ominous message, no organization has been definitively linked to the blast and all possible angles are being thoroughly investigated, officials said.The CCTV at the spot also shows a suspect donning a white T-shirt at the scene a few hours before the blast, sources said, describing it as “suspicious activity”. The detonation, which occurred at 7 am, inflicted damage on the school wall, adjacent shops and a parked vehicle but, miraculously, no casualties were reported.Special teams from National Investigation Agency (NIA), National Security Guard (NSG), CRPF and Delhi Police are gathering evidence and conducting a comprehensive analysis of the blast site. The improvised explosive device presumably employed a remote detonator or timer mechanism.According to sources, the explosive was meticulously wrapped in a plastic bag and strategically planted in a shallow pit, approximately half to one foot deep. The pit was then deliberately covered with garbage to conceal the device.CRPF officials from Institute of IED Management, Pune, have conducted a comprehensive ground assessment while NSG's bomb disposal squad is preparing to submit its report to Delhi Police which is likely to submit a preliminary report to MHA.The FIR lodged in the case states: ""...A conspicuous hole in the boundary wall of the school is evident, caused by the blast's impact. Additionally, windowpanes and signboards of the shops opposite the CRPF school sustained damage due to the blast's force...During the meticulous inspection, a white powder was discovered scattered near the site. The area was promptly cordoned off and senior officers were apprised of the situation.”","Investigators probing if the blast outside the CRPF school in Prashant Vihar, Rohini, was carried out to send a message over the incident.

Four experts were divided on whether the giveaway violates federal laws that make it a crime to pay or offer to pay a person to register to vote. Musk's representatives did not respond.""There is certainly an argument that this falls within the scope of a federal prohibition on paying a person to vote or register to vote,"" said Daniel Weiner of left-leaning Brennan Center for Justice. But Brad Smith, Federal Election Commission ex-chairman, said Musk is likely in the clear because signing the petition is far removed from registering to vote.While Musk's promotion does not directly induce people to register, its timing and focus on battleground states indicate the petition component is merely a pretext, according to Richard Hasen, a law professor at the University of California who said the sweepstakes is therefore illegal. Adav Noti of the non-partisan Campaign Legal Center agreed, saying it is illegal to give out money on the condition that people are registered to vote. But Smith said Musk has other plausible reasons for wanting people to sign the petition, including gathering names of likely voters who support his causes. Musk, world's richest person, has so far given $75 million to Trump's campaign.

Will Hamas get a new chief after Yahya Sinwar's death? Here's what reports suggest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/will-hamas-get-a-new-chief-after-yahya-sinwars-death-heres-what-reports-suggest/articleshow/114443946.cms,"The Palestinian militant group Hamas is leaning toward appointing a ruling committee based in Doha rather than a single successor following the death of their chief, Yahya Sinwar Sinwar was killed by Israeli forces last week, a move that has spurred discussions within the group about its leadership moving forward.According to sources within Hamas, the group has decided not to name a new leader until the next internal elections scheduled for March, provided circumstances allow.“The Hamas leadership's approach is not to appoint a successor to the late chief, the martyr Yahya Sinwar, until their next elections,” a source from the group told AFP.Mewanwhile, a five-member committee, which was formed in August after the assassination of political chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, will assume leadership responsibilities. Sinwar, who was appointed Gaza chief of Hamas in 2017, ascended to the top leadership role after Haniyeh's assassination in July.The committee, comprised of key representatives from Gaza, the West Bank, and the Palestinian diaspora, includes Khalil al-Hayya (Gaza), Zaher Jabarin (West Bank), and Khaled Meshaal (representing Palestinians abroad). Two other key members are Mohammed Darwish, head of Hamas's Shura advisory council, and the political bureau's secretary. All members of the committee are currently based in Qatar.The committee has been tasked with governing Hamas during the ongoing conflict, making strategic decisions, and shaping the group's future plans. “The committee will govern the movement during the war and exceptional circumstances, as well as its future trajectory,” the source said.Another source revealed that there had been internal discussions about appointing a political chief whose identity would remain secret, but the leadership ultimately chose to proceed with collective rule through the committee.Sinwar's death came as Israeli forces intensified their military operations in Gaza. He was killed in southern Gaza, more than a year into the war that erupted after Hamas launched a major offensive on October 7.The death of Yahya Sinwar has created a leadership vacuum within the Palestinian terrorist organization. Various reports speculated about potential candidates who could step into the role.","Hamas is leaning toward appointing a ruling committee based in Doha rather than a single successor following the death of their chief, Yahya Sinwar Sinwar was killed by Israeli forces last week.

The Arctic Circle , an extraordinary region covering 4% of Earth’s surface, is a land of extremes where the sun can shine at midnight or darkness may reign at noon. Despite its harsh conditions, this vast area is home to hundreds of thousands of people across eight countries, including the U.S. (Alaska), Canada, Russia, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark (Greenland), and Iceland.It boasts unique wildlife, such as the Arctic fox, and notable cities like Murmansk , the largest north of the Circle.The region is governed by the Arctic Council , focusing on sustainable development and environmental protection. With dramatic landscapes and natural wonders like the Northern Lights, the Arctic Circle continues to fascinate, though its boundaries slowly retreat due to Earth's shifting axial tilt.The Arctic Circle stretches from 66 to 67 degrees north. Alaska's Point Barrow is the northernmost point of the U.S., but Canada, Russia, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Greenland, and Iceland all have land in the region.The Arctic fox, with its thick fur and nomadic nature, travels across the entire region. Its white coat provides natural camouflage from predators like polar bears and wolves.Murmansk, a Russian port with around 295,000 people, is the largest city in the Arctic. Norilsk, also in Russia, follows, known for mining and the Nord Kamal Mosque. Tromsø, Norway, is the most populous city outside of Russia and is renowned for viewing the Northern Lights.Established in 1996, the Arctic Council addresses sustainable development and environmental protection in the region. Military issues are excluded from its mandate.Even during the polar night, communities still experience twilight. For example, in Utqiaġvik, Alaska, the sun doesn’t rise for 65 days, but twilight still lasts for three to six hours daily.In the North Pole, the sun rises during the spring equinox in March and doesn’t set until September, earning the Arctic the nickname ""Land of the Midnight Sun."" In Tromsø, Norway, this phenomenon lasts for about two months.While the Arctic's average winter temperature is minus 40°F (minus 40°C), the Antarctic is far colder at minus 76°F (minus 60°C) in winter due to the South Pole's lack of moderating seawater. Unlike the Arctic, the Antarctic Circle has no permanent human settlements.The Arctic Circle Centre in Norway is a great tourist spot with breathtaking views, a cafe, and a gift shop, though it’s not open year-round.Earth's axial tilt is shifting, causing the Arctic Circle’s boundary to retreat by 46 to 49 feet (14 to 15 metres) annually, altering the region over time.","The Arctic Circle is home to hundreds of thousands of people across eight countries.

Like Epstein's list, a list of names, all celebrities, with links to P Diddy and his Freak sessions, are doing the rounds on social media.The alleged list contains names of Leonardo Dicaprio , Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Ashton Kutcher, Paris Hilton, Howard Stern, Russell Brand, Mariah Carey, Jennifer Lopez, Russell Simmons, Usher, Meghan Fox. The list goes viral as Usher, Pink deleted their X posts and theories that Justin Bieber might have been a victim of Diddy float around.Nobody has been implicated in the Sean Combs case so far.P Diddy is facing serious charges of sex trafficking and racketeering where he forced women to have sex with male prostitutes that continued for days as the entire action was caught on camera. Huge stocks of baby oil, drugs were found at Diddy's sex den while Diddy did not plead guilty to the charges.Usher who once stayed with Diddy said his X account got hacked and that's why all his past posts disappeared. This happened as his old statement in which said he witnessed wild things when he stayed with Diddy resurfaced.Apart from Usher and Pink, Megan Fox deleted all her posts on Instagram and X triggering speculations over how she was linked to Diddy.An old snipped of Khloe Kardashian claiming that she attended one of Diddy's naked parties emerged. ""I got on a plane at 5:30 am. Well this party...I think half the people there were butt naked,"" this is exactly what Khloe said about Diddy's party.Diddy was Justin Bieber's mentor but Bieber's spokesperson said he is trying not to focus on the charges and accusation of Diddy. Justin is in a happy bubble since he became a father.As the list of the Hollywood A-listers becomes long, they are maintaining absolute silence over Diddy's arrest.An officer involved in the raid on Diddy's home compared him to Jeffrey Epstein, stating that Diddy was part of the same social circle as Epstein and Harvey Weinstein. The officer claimed there were 15 years of wild parties, suggesting that while not everyone who attended was complicit in trafficking, they witnessed inappropriate behavior. He emphasized that many people knew what went on, especially as things became more explicit late at night.Also read on the Diddy case:","No Hollywood A-lister has been implicated in the Sean Diddy trafficking case but several 'Diddy lists' are viral.

'Lightning rod'

'Outlawed'

LOS ANGELES: Donald Trump may have become involved with a porn star, but if elected president he could try shutting down the entire industry, adult film stars are warning in a push to get young men to vote against the Republican next month.The #HandsOffMyPorn campaign has spent $200,000 so far on ads to run on adult websites, warning viewers that prominent allies of Trump want to ban pornography and lock up the stars who bring it to vivid, graphic life.And they want Americans to fight back at the ballot box.""If you care about adult entertainment , if you consume or create adult entertainment, you gotta vote November 5,"" porn actress Siouxsie Q told AFP. ""There's no two ways about it.""The initiative comes in response to Project 2025 , a blueprint for reshaping the federal government should Trump, the Republican nominee, win the election.Page five of the 900-page tome's foreword states: ""Pornography should be outlawed. The people who produce and distribute it should be imprisoned.""Trump has tried to distance himself from Project 2025. But dozens of his allies and former administration members co-wrote the document, and Democrats have argued that many of its policies match his own positions.The #HandsOffMyPorn campaign is aimed primarily at men, who are four times more likely to report watching porn than women, according to the Institute for Family Studies.Just weeks before the extremely close US election between Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris, pollsters report a giant gender division among voters.Trump enjoys a strong lead among male voters, regularly taking his machismo-drenched pitch to young men on right-wing podcasts.Now, #HandsOffMyPorn's ""public service announcements"" are being played to users in battleground states like Pennsylvania, Arizona and Georgia, often just before they watch adult videos.Stars like Siouxsie Q appear and say: ""Hey, I know you're busy. I know you're doing something. Hold on. If you want to keep doing this, you really need to vote on November 5... Enjoy!""Harris is not in any way affiliated with the #HandsOffMyPorn campaign, which is paid for by the independent Artists United for Change committee, noted Siouxsie Q.""Hopefully, secretly, she likes what we're doing,"" she added.Crackdowns on pornography are nothing new for the United States.But Holly Randall, a 26-year veteran of the adult industry, said she has never seen such a potentially devastating threat to the sector.That even includes when her parents, who worked in porn during Ronald Reagan's crackdown in the 1980s, had to film hardcore scenes in secret.""I've seen these attacks come and go.... Project 2025, is the most explicit iteration of wanting to completely outlaw porn,"" she said.""Absolutely, I am worried about imprisonment,"" added Siouxsie Q, who made her name performing in feminist, queer and bondage films, before moving on to producing.Porn stars also warn that the consequences could extend far beyond even their wildly popular industry.According to Siouxsie Q, pornography is the ""canary in the coal mine"" for the freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment. She pointed also to Republican-led banning of sex education books from school libraries.And Randall said adult entertainment is a ""lightning rod"" for wider issues such as trans rights, same-sex marriage and even reproductive rights.""It's always the easiest thing to attack, because it represents people's uncertainty and fear about the changing morals of sexuality and of gender fluidity,"" she said.Trump has repeatedly claimed he has nothing to do with Project 2025.However, a New York Times investigation this week found ""well over half"" of the document's authors had been in Trump's previous administration or on his campaign or transition teams.Randall noted the irony of Trump -- convicted for fraud over ""hush money"" payments to porn star Stormy Daniels -- becoming embroiled in the movement, even if she suspects he personally ""doesn't actually care whether or not it's outlawed.""""But it's the people around him, like (Trump running mate) J.D. Vance, these ultra-right-wing conservatives, who want to ban porn,"" she said.Vance wrote the foreword to an upcoming book by Kevin D. Roberts -- the author of the Project 2025 section that calls for a ban on porn.""I think Trump will easily step aside and allow that to happen,"" said Randall.","#HandsOffMyPorn campaign has spent $200,000 so far on ads to run on adult websites.

Now, Biden’s rallying cry has been met with cheers from his base, though Vice President Kamala Harris has distanced herself from the slogan at her events, stating, ""The courts will handle that. Let's handle November, shall we?""Biden also highlighted concerns raised by global leaders regarding Trump’s possible re-election. “Every international meeting I attend... they pull me aside and say, ‘Joe, he can’t win. My democracy is at stake,’” he revealed, underlining the international ramifications of the election.During the rally, Biden acknowledged the support Harris has received from some prominent Republicans, including former Congresswoman Liz Cheney. However, his focus remained firmly on Trump, whom he accused of having ""anti-democratic"" attitudes and aligning himself with authoritarian figures.With polls showing a tight race between Trump and Harris, Biden's sharp rhetoric underscores the high stakes of the forthcoming election.

US secretary of state Antony Blinken met PM Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Tuesday and pressed him ""to capitalise on"" the killing of the Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar and end the war in the Gaza Strip, a state department spokesman said.Netanyahu also said Israel was working hard to bring back hostages still held in Gaza and that the elimination of Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar ""may have a positive effect on the return of the hostages, the achievement of all the goals of the war, and the day after the war"".On his 11th trip to West Asia since the conflict began a little more than a year ago, Blinken met with Netanyahu for two-and-a-half hours, making the case that with the death of Sinwar, Israel should seize the opportunity ""by securing the release of all hostages and ending the conflict in Gaza in a way that provides lasting security for Israelis and Palestinians alike,"" the spokesman, Matthew Miller, said in a statement.US Prez Biden and his administration have repeatedly tried to calm the widening conflict in West Asia, where Israel is fighting Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon , and Iran, which backs both armed groups.

Another watch was gifted to Giuliani by the president of France after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, when Giuliani was mayor of New York City , CNBC reported.Freeman and Moss sued Giuliani for defamation after he repeatedly targeted the two women with false election fraud claims as part of his efforts to overturn Trump's loss to President Joe Biden in the 2020 election .In December, a federal jury in Washington, DC, ordered the former mayor to pay them more than $148 million in punitive damages and for emotional distress and defamation.Giuliani filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition to shield himself from sudden financial ruin, but a New York federal bankruptcy judge dismissed his case, the report said.Giuliani has so far paid none of the nine-figure defamation judgment against him, and he has not obtained a court stay that would allow him to delay paying off that massive debt, the court said in its order.The court also allowed the plaintiffs to pursue a debt that Giuliani says he is still owed for his work after the 2020 election, totaling about $2 million that Trump's 2020 campaign and the Republican National Committee have failed to pay.Giuliani has seven days to hand over those items and more to a receivership controlled by former Georgia election workers Ruby Freeman and Wandrea ""Shaye"" Moss, Manhattan federal Judge Lewis Liman ruled.Giuliani repeatedly targeted the two women with false election fraud claims as part of his efforts to overturn Trump's loss to President Joe Biden in the 2020 election.""The profound irony manifest in Defendant's alleged concern is not lost on the Court,"" the judge wrote.""By his own admission, Defendant defamed Plaintiffs by perpetuating lies about them.

A judge in Michigan on Monday rejected an effort by the Republican Party to block some Americans who are living overseas from voting in the battleground state. The Republican National Committee filed a lawsuit earlier this month arguing that election laws in the state improperly allowed US citizens living abroad who had never lived in Michigan - but whose relatives had - to vote there.Michigan Court of Claims Judge Sima Patel said in a ruling that the language being challenged by Republicans was consistent with federal and state law.""There is no ground to invalidate it,"" Patel wrote.A US citizen who never lived in the US but who has a parent, legal guardian or spouse who last lived in Michigan is eligible to vote in the state as long as the citizen has not registered or voted in another state, according to Michigan's secretary of state election officials manual.At the time the lawsuit was filed, RNC Chairman Michael Whatley said citizens living in Michigan should not have ""their votes canceled by those who've never lived in the state.""The RNC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the ruling.Some 2.9 million US citizens living abroad were eligible to vote in 2020, though fewer than 8% of them did, according to the Federal Voting Assistance Program, a government entity that helps military members and other US citizens living abroad with election logistics.","The Republican National Committee filed a lawsuit earlier this month.

Pakistan Parliament: Pakistan parliament clips powers of judiciary,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-parliament-clips-powers-of-judiciary/articleshow/114436941.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s parliament clipped the powers of the Supreme Court in the early hours of Monday by empowering the executive through an amendment to the constitution passed with a two-thirds majority in both the senate and the National assembly.With full backing from the powerful military, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif ’s govt had been attempting since last month to introduce a set of constitutional changes in parliament apparently aimed at granting more powers to the executive in making judicial appointments.The 26th Constitutional Amendment Bill, 2024, passed during a late-night session of parliament, aimed at taking away the SC’s suo motu powers, setting the chief justice of Pakistan’s term at three years, and empowering the PM to appoint the next top judge from among the three most senior SC judges. It states that a 12-member parliamentary committee, comprising eight NA members and four from the Senate, will appoint the chief justice from a panel of the three most senior judges of the top court for a period of three years. The panel will forward the name to the PM who will then send it to the president for appointment.The bill, tabled by law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, was approved by the NA with 225 votes, one more than required for a two-thirds majority, after a handful of turncoats from jailed former PM Imran Khan ’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) voted against the party’s policy. In the Senate, the required number for two-thirds was 64 and 65 members voted in favour. Hours later, President Asif Ali Zardari gave formal assent to the new law. Imran’s party, however, abstained from voting.An earlier attempt, in Sept, by the governing PML-N to bulldoze the amendments did not succeed as it failed to win the support of some opposition lawmakers and the legislation could not be tabled despite the two Houses being in session.Sharif’s govt said the constitutional amendment has ensured that parliament will not remain a rubber stamp in future. The current govt’s tensions with the judiciary have been on the rise since controversial nationwide general elections were held in Feb this year.The new legislation, specifically about judicial reforms, was passed just days ahead of the retirement of chief justice Qazi Faez Isa . Khan’s PTI has been accusing Isa of being aligned with govt, an allegation govt has repeatedly rejected.Under the previous law, Justice Isa would have been automatically replaced by the senior puisne judge, currently Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, who has consistently issued verdicts deemed favourable to Khan and PTI.PTI assailed the “conscience” of lawmakers affiliated with it who voted in favour of the amendment. “They won votes on Imran Khan’s name and sold their vote to the same mafia against whom the public gave them the mandate!” the party said on its ‘X’ account, sharing pictures of the said lawmakers and terming them “seditious”.“These conscience-sellers would be counted among the darkest characters in Pakistan’s history,” it added.PTI chairman Gohar Ali Khan criticised the bill, saying it would make the judiciary “subservient” for all time.",Pakistan's parliament clipped the powers of the Supreme Court in the early hours of Monday by empowering the executive.

Controversy over the amendments



Row over how Bill was passed

Historical achievement: PM Shehbaz Sharif



Charter of Democracy



In a late-night session that began at 11.36pm on Sunday and extended well past midnight, the Pakistan National Assembly passed at 5am on Monday the highly controversial 26th Constitutional Amendment that critics say effectively neuters the judicial system of the country.In another sign of the desperate hurry, President Asif Ali Zardari gave his assent to the law mere hours after the approval of both houses of parliament.The Constitution (26th Amendment) Act, 2024, was introduced to address perceived issues within the judicial system of Pakistan, particularly focusing on the powers of the Supreme Court and the appointment of its Chief Justice.While proponents argue that these reforms are necessary for improving judicial efficiency and accountability, opponents contend that they threaten judicial independence and may pave the way for increased political interference in legal matters.The timing and nature of this amendment have raised suspicions about political motivations behind it.Critics argue that this move is an attempt by the ruling coalition led byShehbaz Sharif to exert control over an independent judiciary, particularly in light of ongoing tensions with former Prime Minister Imran Khan's party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).The PTI has vehemently opposed these changes, viewing them as a direct threat to judicial independence and an effort to undermine checks and balances within government institutions.Many legal experts and political analysts have expressed concern that limiting the CJP's tenure could lead to politicisation within the judiciary. By establishing a commission that includes political appointees, there are fears that judicial appointments may become more susceptible to political influence rather than being based solely on merit and legal expertise.The legal community has also voiced strong opposition against these amendments, stating that the changes could lead to a judiciary that is less willing to challenge government actions or uphold constitutional rights if they are perceived as beholden to political interests.There are serious allegations of coercion surrounding the passage of the 26th Constitutional Amendment.Local media reports suggested that members of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) faced intimidation tactics, including threats of abduction, to ensure their support for the Bill. PTI leaders have claimed that their lawmakers were pressured into voting in favor of the amendment or faced consequences for non-compliance.The process leading up to the amendment has also been criticised for its lack of transparency and consensus among political parties. While some coalition members gave broad support for the amendment, others, particularly from PTI, expressed their refusal to participate in what they describe as a coerced vote.The hurried nature of this legislative process has raised questions about whether adequate deliberation occurred among lawmakers regarding such significant constitutional changes.The government required 224 votes to pass the Bill. As voting commenced under the chairmanship of NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq, 225 members of the National Assembly supported the motion, while 12 members from the PTI and the Sunni-Ittehad Council (SIC) opposed it.The Bill comprised 27 clauses. After the passage of the first clause, the PTI members walked out of the assembly.Following the passage of the bill, PM Shehbaz Sharif delivered a speech and congratulated the parliament for the ""historical achievement"", said a report by Dawn.""This amendment, the 26th, is not just an amendment, but an example of national solidarity and consensus. A new sun will rise, emanating across the nation,"" PM Shehbaz said.PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari thanked the PML-N, MQM-P, IPP, JUI-F, ANP, and other parties for their contributions to the Bill.He also extended his gratitude to the PTI, stating: ""I also thank the PTI for playing a part in this historic achievement. This is a political success, and I wish you wouldn't have portrayed your own victory as a loss.""PTI's Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly, Omar Ayub Khan, took over the floor of the NA and criticised the amendments, arguing that they did not reflect the will of the Pakistani people.Taking a jab at law minister Tarar and Bilawal, he said that those who had ""gone missing"" should have been thanked as well during the note of thanks. Ayub detailed how PTI lawmakers were ""tortured and harassed"".""These were all tactics to pressure us. The mistreatment of Imran Khan in jail is also an example,"" he said.Ayub also questioned the urgency behind passing the amendments, asking: ""What would have happened had it been passed on October 31?""He also said that the amendments were an attempt to undermine the independence of the judiciary.Meanwhile, Defence minister Khawaja Asif said the amendment had been passed by the Senate ""to restore respect and dignity of the parliament and the House"". ""There must be consistency in our political behaviour otherwise we will not get the respect and dignity we seek,"" he said.As per the report by Dawn, Asif went on to say that the constitutional amendments were not something that the government had ""newly invented"" but it was a continuation of the Charter of Democracy that all political leaders, including Imran, had unanimously signed.The Charter of Democracy was signed in London on May 14, 2006, by major political parties in response to the military dictatorship of General Pervez Musharraf, with the aim of promoting democratic norms and preventing the abuse of power by unelected institutions such as the military and judiciary.",The amendment limits the tenure of the Chief Justice of Pakistan to three years. A new 12-member commission has been established to appoint the CJP. The amendment seeks to dilute the Supreme Court's suo motu powers. A performance evaluation system for judges is introduced to enhance accountability and efficiency within the judiciary.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114423400,imgsize-925818,width-400,resizemode-4/114423400.jpg"

The second option, which is not my preferred path, is to rely on the majority's vote to pass it,"" Dawn noted.He urged political parties to consider the future and work towards raising the dignity of parliament, adding that they operate within a certain ""political space"".Bhutto noted that while the PPP was unable to establish a constitutional court during its 2008-2013 government, he is committed to fulfilling the promise made by Benazir Bhutto.He acknowledged opposition to the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), particularly fromPTI leaders, but insisted that the new court would ensure equal representation for all provinces.PTI has been protesting across Pakistan against the implementation of the constitutional amendments as the Party alleges that the bill would undermine the powers of judiciary.PTI leaders have also alleged that bribes up to Rs 1 Billion are being offered to lawmakers to garner support for passing the amendment law.In the public rally, Bilawal Bhutto gave out historical justifications for implementation of the 26th amendment saying that even Muhammad Ali Jinnah had called for a separate court for routine justice matters at the 1930 Round Table Conference.The FCC, Bhutto claimed, would protect the rights of provinces by providing equal representation and addressing disputes between the federation and provinces.As per Dawn, Bhutto insisted that his mother and former Pakistan PM Benazir Bhutto had supported the establishment of the FCC because she understood the ""real face"" of the judiciary, which he said had repeatedly legitimised dictatorial rule.""After abolishing the 'One Unit' system in the country through parliament, my mother wanted to eliminate the concept of 'One Unit' in the judiciary as well,"" he added.",Bilawal Bhutto Zardari is the chairperson of the Pakistan People's Party.

NEW DELHI: Police in Pakistan used tear gas and batons to disperse student protesters on Thursday after they ransacked a college building. The protests erupted over an alleged on-campus rape in Lahore that has sparked anger and demonstrations in four cities.Reports of the incident spread on social media, increasing tensions on college campuses. Students in Rawalpindi, Punjab province, burned furniture and blocked a key road before vandalizing a college building.Earlier, a security guard died during clashes between student protesters and police in Gujrat, also in Punjab province. Authorities arrested one person related to the guard's death and another for spreading misinformation about the alleged rape.In Lahore, over two dozen students were injured earlier this week while demanding justice for the alleged victim, who students claim was raped at the Punjab Group of Colleges.In response to the growing unrest, the government banned rallies in Punjab. The Federal Investigation Agency filed cases against 36 people accused of spreading misinformation on social media.Authorities, including the Punjab chief minister, and the woman’s parents denied any assault happened. However, Punjab police called on the public to share any information regarding the alleged rape.The unrest seems to have started spontaneously, as student unions in Pakistan have been banned since 1984.These protests also come after a woman reported being gang-raped during a polio vaccination drive in Sindh province last month. Police arrested three men involved, but the woman's husband expelled her from home, citing damage to the family name.","Protests erupted over an alleged on-campus rape in Lahore that has sparked anger.

Lahore, Punjab's first woman Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Wednesday dismissed allegations of an on-campus rape incident at a Lahore college as fabricated, accusing Pakistan's jailed former premier Imran Khan's party of using the false claim to incite widespread student protests and create unrest in the province. She also demanded that Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) party be treated in the same way as ""banned organisations"" in the country.Maryam, daughter of former three-time prime minister Nawaz Sharif, claimed that the rape incident was fabricated to create unrest in Punjab. She accused political opponents, particularly PTI, of using students and the media to propagate false information for political gains.On Wednesday, a large number of students held demonstrations in Jehlum, Faisalabad, and Gujrat, demanding justice for the alleged rape victim.However, the chief minister stated that no incident of rape took place at the Punjab College for Women in Lahore. She alleged that PTI and its media supporters spread the fake news to destabilise the province by manipulating innocent students.On Monday, at least 28 students, including girls, were injured during clashes with police over the alleged rape incident. Protesters claimed that the college administration had deleted CCTV footage to cover up the case.Maryam accused PTI of attempting to destabilise the government by spreading false narratives, particularly during the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, which portrayed Pakistan positively on the global stage. The two-day SCO summit concluded on Wednesday.She warned of strict action against those spreading fake news, including media personnel. ""On social media, a factory of lies is running. PTI's politics have sunk so low that it is exploiting tragedies for political gain,"" Maryam said, adding that the girl in question had suffered a back injury, not a rape, and was in the hospital ICU since October 2, contradicting the circulated claims.Addressing PTI founder Khan, who has been incarcerated in Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail for the last 15 months, she remarked, ""If politics stoops to such levels of inhumanity, then you deserve to be where you are.""The chief minister also accused certain individuals from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and abroad of fuelling the controversy through fake news.""The issue isn't social media, but rather PTI, which needs to be controlled...and everything will be fine. They are operating through fake accounts,"" she alleged.Meanwhile, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) cybercrime wing has launched a probe against those involved in spreading disinformation through social media platforms about the alleged on-campus rape incident.A seven-member team headed by Deputy Director Cybercrime Lahore Waqas Saeed will identify individuals responsible for the disinformation campaign and the subsequent law-and-order situation.","Punjab's first woman Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz dismisses rape claims as fabricated.

UN: Bangladesh interim government names 'anti-India' activist as envoy to an unspecified mission,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-interim-government-names-anti-india-activist-as-envoy-to-an-unspecified-mission/articleshow/114484134.cms,"US-based journalist-activist Mushfiqul Fazal Ansarey

Bangladesh's interim government has appointed US-based journalist-activist Mushfiqul Fazal Ansarey , a polarising figure known for his alleged anti-India stance and decade-long campaign against deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina , as ambassador to one of its missions abroad. He returned to Bangladesh on September 12 after nearly a decade in exile.The Bangladesh ministry of public administration issued a notification on Monday confirming the appointment of Ansarey, who raised eyebrows last March when he referred to former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal's arrest during a press briefing with US state department spokesperson Matthew Miller.He has been accorded the status and privileges of a senior secretary with a three-year contract. Amid speculation about which country he might be sent to, sources said the foreign affairs ministry would notify his posting soon.Ansarey's appointment coincided with the interim government cancelling the contractual appointments of its ambassadors to the United States, Russia and the UAE. The foreign affairs ministry will announce their replacements soon, officials said.Some see the Muhammad Yunus-led interim government's choice of Ansarey as a reward for his decade-long baiting of the erstwhile Awami League administration led by Sheikh Hasina. He was the assistant press secretary to former prime minister Khaleda Zia from 2001 to 2006.Ansarey currently serves as executive editor of the Washington-based foreign policy magazine South Asia Perspectives . He is also the editor and White House correspondent for JustNewsBD, covering the UN , the US state department, and the Pentagon.",Mushfiqul Fazal Ansarey is a polarising figure known for his alleged anti-India stance.

'He was in favour of genocide': Protesters call for Bangladesh president's removal over remarks on Hasina,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/he-was-in-favour-of-genocide-protesters-call-for-bangladesh-presidents-removal-over-remarks-on-hasina/articleshow/114469530.cms,"Calls for the removal of president Mohammed Shahabuddin have emerged in Bangladesh after his remarks about the resignation of the deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina . The calls intensified on Tuesday when a student organisation that led protests against Hasina's government staged demonstrations in Dhaka.The Anti-discrimination Student Movement , which spearheaded the campaign that resulted in Hasina's ouster, rallied in front of the Central Shaheed Minar, demanding Shahabuddin's resignation.Nasir Uddin Patwari, a protest leader said, ""The president is an ally of fascism. He was in favour of genocide . We demand his resignation.""Another group, the Shadhinota-Shorbobhoumotto Rokkha Committee, held a sit-in protest at Dhaka University, calling for Shahabuddin's resignation, the abolition of the Constitution, and the establishment of a ""revolutionary government.""Some protesters also indicated that the president could soon face a campaign calling for his removal. They also demanded the dissolution of Hasina's Awami League party and its allies from political activities.A prominent leader of the group, Rafiq Khan labeled Shahabuddin a ""culprit"" for being ""unlawfully"" appointed by ""killer Hasina.""""We request him to resign immediately and vacate the Bangabhaban. Otherwise, we will start another movement like the one in July,"" he added.Shahabuddin stated that he has no documentary proof of Hasina's resignation as prime minister, noting that she left the country in August during widespread student-led protests.In a recent interview with the Bangla daily Manab Zamin, he mentioned he heard that Hasina had resigned before fleeing Bangladesh, but he could not verify it with any documents.Despite multiple efforts, Shahabuddin said he was unable to locate any records. ""Perhaps she did not have the time,"" Shahabuddin added. Muhammad Yunus , the 84-year-old Nobel laureate on August 8 assumed the role of Chief Adviser to Bangladesh's interim government following Prime Minister Hasina's departure to India on August 5.According to Shahabuddin's account to the daily, on August 5, around 10.30 am, Bangabhaban received a call from Hasina's residence, stating that she would meet him. However, ""within an hour, another call came, saying she was not coming"".“When everything was under control, one day, the cabinet secretary came to collect a copy of the resignation letter. I told him I was also looking for it,” he said.""There was news of unrest everywhere. I did not know what was going to happen. I could not just sit around relying on rumours. So I asked my military secretary, General Adil (Major General Mohammad Adil Choudhury), to look into it. He also had no information. We were waiting and checking the TV scrolls. There was no news anywhere. At one point, I heard that she had left the country without informing me. I am telling you the truth as it is,"" he added.“Anyway, when the army chief, General Waker, came to Bangabhaban, I tried to find out whether the prime minister had resigned. The answer was the same: he heard she had resigned but probably did not get the time to inform us.,"" he added.Prior to administering the oath of office to Yunus and his advisory council members on August 8, Shahabuddin sought the opinion of the Supreme Court, which advised him to proceed considering the extraordinary circumstances.Earlier on Monday, Asif Nazrul, the Law Affairs Adviser of the interim government, accused the president of ""falsehood"" stating that his comments were ""tantamount to violation of his oath of office"".Nazrul added that if Shahabuddin maintained his stance, the interim government would have to consider whether he was still fit to hold his position.In a televised address on August 5, Shahabuddin had said, ""Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has tendered her resignation letter to the president and I have received it.""Concurrently, the president's office released a statement discouraging the public from reigniting any dispute over a ""settled issue"".""This is a clear statement from His Excellency the President that, all the answers regarding the resignation and departure of the Prime Minister (Hasina) in the face of the students-people mass revolution, the dissolution of the Parliament and all the questions raised in the public mind about the Constitutional validity about the incumbent Interim Government are reflected in the order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in Special Reference No-01/2024, dated August 8, 2024,"" it said.Shahdhin Malik, a Constitution expert, believes that an ""unnecessary debate is going on over the documentary evidence of Hasina's resignation letter amid the existing reality"".""After the toppling of Sheikh Hasina's government, the interim government has been formed on the basis of the Supreme Court's opinion...no debate is required about it,"" he further added.Meanwhile, Hasina's son Sajeeb Wazed had clarified earlier that Hasina never ""officially resigned"" as she did not have the time to do so.“My mother never officially resigned. She didn’t get the time,” Wazed said from Washington. “She had planned to make a statement and submit her resignation. But then the protesters started marching on the prime minister’s residence. And there was no time. My mother wasn’t even packed. As far as the constitution goes, she is still the prime minister of Bangladesh,” he had said.",Shahabuddin stated that he has no documentary proof of Hasina's resignation as prime minister. He noted that she left the country in August during widespread student-led protests. Protesters also indicated that the president could soon face a campaign calling for his removal.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114471191,imgsize-1230111,width-400,resizemode-4/114471191.jpg"
