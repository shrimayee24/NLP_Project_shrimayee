A well-planned deception

Digital footprints under scrutiny



NEW DELHI: In a chilling case that has shocked the capital, a 20-year-old Delhi University student, Arjun Tanwar , has been arrested for the brutal murder of his father, a retired Army officer , his mother and his sister at their home in Neb Sarai .The murders, committed early Wednesday—his parents’ wedding anniversary—were allegedly driven by a deep-seated grudge over property disputes and familial resentment. Police say Arjun carefully planned the crime, even attempting to mislead authorities by feigning innocence.According to investigators, Arjun believed his father, Rajesh Kumar (51), was planning to transfer their family property to his sister, Kavita (23).This, combined with his father’s stern disapproval of Arjun’s boxing ambitions and repeated public humiliation, ignited his fury.“He told us he opted for slitting their throats as he knew it would prevent them from screaming. He was so enraged with his father that he stabbed him in the head,” said the police.Arjun followed his regular routine, heading out for an early morning run at 5.30 am to stage a facade of normalcy.Upon returning, he ran to his gym and informed the owner that his parents had been murdered. He then alerted neighbours and relatives in a bid to avert suspicion.However, a police investigation uncovered inconsistencies in his account. ""When we questioned Arjun, he started giving different answers and there were multiple contradictions,"" said Sanjay Kumar Jain, joint commissioner of police (South).Rajesh’s lifeless body was discovered upstairs, while his wife Komal (46) and daughter Kavita were found in separate rooms on the ground floor.The victims bore horrifying injuries—throats slit, stab wounds aplenty. In a grim detail, clothing had been placed around their necks, likely in an attempt to stem the flow of blood.Arjun reportedly began his killing spree with his sister, who tried to fight back, as evidenced by the injuries on her body.He then moved to his father, attacking him in his sleep. Lastly, his mother, who had gone to the bathroom, was ambushed as she returned.Arjun used his father’s Army knife to carry out the murders, a weapon chosen for its lethal precision.Arjun, a political science student and a trained boxer who had won a silver medal representing Delhi, harboured a profound grudge against his family.He resented his father for supporting his sister, who was pursuing a master’s degree and for frequently reprimanding him about his studies and routine.“Arjun felt neglected and isolated,” police revealed. “He also suspected his father planned to hand over their property to his sister.”Rajesh’s treatment of Arjun, including physical reprimands in public, further fuelled his rage. Sources disclosed that tensions escalated during his sister’s birthday on December 1, when Rajesh allegedly assaulted him again.Police are now examining Arjun’s digital devices to determine if he sought inspiration online to execute the heinous crime.The case, cracked by a team under ACP Abhinendra Jain, exposes the chilling depths of resentment and anger that culminated in a tragedy tearing apart an unsuspecting family.","Arjun Tanwar, 20, has been arrested for the brutal murder of his father, a retired Army officer, his mother and his sister at their home in Neb Sarai.

HYDERABAD: Revathi and Mogadampalli Bhaskar's son Sritej, 9, became a fan of Telugu actor Allu Arjun after watching 'Pushpa: The Rise' three years ago, so much so that neighbours nicknamed him 'Pushpa'.As Sritej battled for life in a Hyderabad hospital on Thursday and his mother's body lay in a mortuary, an inconsolable Bhaskar wondered if 32-year-old Revathi lost her life by putting family above self, as always.She died in the stampede at a city theatre the previous night during the premiere of the sequel to the 2021 'Pushpa' film.""She gave me life, and now she's gone,"" the 40-year-old said. Revathi donated part of her liver in 2023 when he needed a transplant. Her last moments, too, were about making the children happy, he recalled.Sritej and his younger sister Sanvi had been pestering their parents to take them for a show of 'Pushpa 2: The Rule'. Wednesday was supposed to be a special movie night for them, with Arjun being in attendance at the premiere in Sandhya Theatre. Revathi was with Sritej when the stampede broke out, trapping both in a melee of frantic feet. Bhaskar had moved away with Sanvi earlier because the girl started crying amid jostling by fans desperate for a glimpse of the film star.""I decided to drop Sanvi at my in-laws' home in the lane next to the theatre.

""I remember someone showing me a video where Sritej was being carried in a stranger's arms, then being taken in a patrol car that stopped at Chikkadpally police station. He was motionless as they drove him to KIMS Hospital,"" said the anxious father.""I didn't get any updates about Revathi until 2.30am Thursday. That's when some cops broke the news to me, and my world crashed.""Bhaskar has since being trying to convince himself to ""stay strong"" for Sanvi.

Attack on former Punjab deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal shows rise of radical fringe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/attack-on-former-punjab-dy-cm-sukhbir-singh-badal-shows-rise-of-radical-fringe/articleshow/115985062.cms,"NEW DELHI/AMRITSAR: Shiromani Akali Dal chief and former Punjab deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal narrowly escaped assassination while undergoing religious punishment outside Golden Temple on Wednesday when an alert plainclothes cop lunged and pushed pro-Khalistan hardliner Narain Singh Chaura 's gun hand upward, causing the shot to go wide. The shooter had come within a few feet of Badal.The timely intervention of ASI Jasbir Singh in Sukhbir's security detail, and a sewadar (volunteer) who helped overpower the gunman, averted a tragedy. The attack, which occurred around 9.30am, was filmed by reporters covering Day 2 of Sukhbir's penance.Police said Sukhbir was unhurt. Clad in a blue sewadar uniform, the SAD president was sitting at the Golden Temple entrance at the time and had a placard around his neck as part of the ""tankhah"" religious punishment pronounced by the Akal Takht for religious misconduct during his father Parkash Singh Badal's tenure as CM from 2007 to 2017.It was the ubiquitous 'Sikh moderates vs radicals' tug-of-war on display as history-sheeter and highly-radicalised pro-Khalistan terrorist Narain Singh Chaura aimed his weapon at former Punjab deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal, scion of the 'moderate' Badal family.According to an ex-IPS officer from Punjab, the sensational assassination attempt by a terrorist who has been involved in serious offences like murder, attempt to murder, possession of arms and explosives and militancy in the past, and was in constant touch with the leadership of Sikh terrorists outfits based in Pakistan, was the manifestation of the discontent and religious extremism simmering in Punjab for almost two decades.Particularly between 2007 and 2017, when the 'moderate' Badals were in office, the 'radical fringe' voices in the Sikh diaspora grew shriller, using social media as a vehicle to influence and indoctrinate new generation that has no living memory of how their families had suffered at the height of Sikh terror and who only seem to have seen the romanticised, pro-Khalistan propaganda fed to them online.""The 'radical extremism' sentiment seems to have only gained momentum in the wake of the farmers' protests/unrest, dominated by agriculturists from Punjab,"" added another officer.Pakistan not only sheltered the leadership of prominent pro-Khalistan outfits like Babbar Khalsa International and Khalistan Tiger Force for the past several years, but also continued to press on the pro-Khalistan pedal through projects like the Sikhs for Justice's 'Khalistan Referendum 2020'.The Sikh diaspora, in which the extremists seem to hold sway, provided funding and resources to pro-Khalistan elements, even as Pakistan-backed actors whipped up communal tensions and ensured a steady supply of arms. That even laws like UAPA could not hold back terrorists like Chaura for long, enabling him to get relief from the courts and go back to extremist activities, made the threat of radicals crushing any moderate voices, even more real.""Those born after 1993, when Sikh militancy had faded out due to a tough police crackdown and dominance of moderate voices, were in the past two decades fed on lies that 1.5 lakh people were killed in the militancy era, when the actual number of deaths was around 22,000, including 1,800 police personnel. Radical voices like Simranjit Singh Mann building a popular base by fighting polls and the emergence of radical leaders like Waaris Panjab De chief Amritpal Singh are proof that pro-Khalistan sentiments have been on the rise in Punjab,"" said a former intelligence officer.The solution, several officers told TOI, lay in promoting moderate voices to neutralise 'radical fringe', strengthening police's hands to deal with extremists and tightening anti-terror laws.","Shiromani Akali Dal chief and former Punjab deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal narrowly escaped assassination.

"Joe Biden administration weighs preemptive pardons for Fauci, Schiff, and other ahead of Trump return",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-administration-weighs-preemptive-pardons-for-for-fauci-schiff-and-other-ahead-of-trump-return/articleshow/115987950.cms,"US President Joe Biden ’s senior aides in the White House are conducting a vigorous internal debate over issuing preemptive pardons to protect various public officials, including Dr Anthony Fauci from potential prosecution under a Trump administration, who is set to take over the presidential post next month, according to the Politico report.The urgency has heightened following President-elect Donald Trump 's announcement of Kash Patel as his choice to lead the FBI, given Patel's public statements about pursuing Trump's critics. However, officials are cautious about issuing pardons to individuals who haven't committed crimes, as it might appear improper and validate Trump's criticisms.The discussions, led by White House counsel Ed Siskel and chief of staff Jeff Zients, encompass both current officeholders and former officials who have drawn Trump's ire. Potential candidates include Sen.-elect Adam Schiff, former Rep. Liz Cheney, and Dr Fauci. Trump has previously stated that ""Cheney should go to Jail along with the rest of the Unselect Committee!""As soon as the report came, Dr Fauci's odds of being pardoned by President Biden skyrocket on Polymarket.These deliberations reflect growing concerns among Democrats about potential retribution under a second Trump presidency. The recent broad pardon of Hunter Biden demonstrates the administration's worries about future prosecutions.Some Democratic lawmakers support preemptive pardons, citing the precedent of Gerald Ford's pardon of Richard Nixon. Senator Ed Markey and Representative Brendan Boyle have publicly advocated for such measures. However, others, including potential recipients like Schiff, have expressed reservations.A particular concern for Biden's team is the financial burden of legal defence that investigations could impose on officials. Some appointees are reportedly seeking higher-paying positions to prepare for potential legal expenses.The administration also faces pressure to extend clemency to ordinary citizens, particularly following Hunter Biden's pardon. Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries has called for pardons for working-class Americans imprisoned for non-violent offences, as per Politico.The central question revolves around interpreting Trump's statements about potential retribution against Democrats and perceived Deep State opponents, considering both their seriousness and literal implications.Historical presidential pardons have sparked controversy, yet the current situation facing Biden officials appears more complex than previous cases, such as George HW Bush's pardon of Caspar Weinberger or Bill Clinton's pardon of Marc Rich. The situation intensifies as Trump's associates discuss potential tribunals against opponents.The president's decision to pardon his son has created additional complications, particularly amongst Democratic Party members already concerned about Biden's re-election campaign at age 82. The administration now faces questions about extending similar legal protection to officials who have drawn criticism from Trump and his supporters.Congressional Democrats present conflicting viewpoints. Senator Ed Markey (D-Mass.) has referenced Gerald Ford's pre-emptive pardon of Richard Nixon as a potential model, noting its implementation before any formal charges.""If it's clear by January 19 that [revenge] is his intention, then I would recommend to President Biden that he provide those preemptive pardons to people, because that's really what our country is going to need next year,"" Markey said on WGBH last week.Representative Brendan Boyle (D-Penn.), who recently hosted Biden in his district, has advocated for comprehensive pardons. ""This is no hypothetical threat,"" Boyle stated, continuing: ""The time for cautious restraint is over. We must act with urgency to push back against these threats and prevent Trump from abusing his power.""","US President Joe Biden’s senior aides in the White House are conducting a vigorous internal debate over issuing preemptive pardons to protect public officials.

Chilling findings



Throats slit, stab wounds



'Calm as always'

NEW DELHI: More disturbing details have surfaced in the gruesome triple murder of a family in south Delhi 's Neb Sarai , where 20-year-old Arjun Tanwar stands accused of allegedly killing his father, Rajesh, mother, Komal and sister, Kavita, in their home.Arjun, described as a reserved and introverted young man, has left those who knew him in utter disbelief.“We didn’t know of any tensions between the father and son,” said Gaurav, a former teacher of the siblings. Neighbours echoed similar sentiments, painting a picture of a quiet, disciplined individual who adhered to a strict regime of gym workouts, boxing practice and running.Although Arjun was not academically inclined, unlike his academically gifted sister, Kavita, he reportedly enjoyed his father’s unwavering support.“His father bought him a high-end motorcycle and helped him with his diet and exercise,” revealed a resident.Yet, there were darker moments in his relationship with his sister. One neighbour recalled, “He would sometimes threaten to kill her during arguments, but we thought he was joking.”Investigators disclosed chilling findings from Arjun’s phone, revealing searches for murder-related content over the past few days, along with research into poisoning methods using sulphas, a deadly chemical.The young man admitted to stealing his father’s Army knife just a day before the murders.The sequence of events unfolded with horrifying precision.According to police, Arjun first attacked his sister when she resisted and bit his hand. “He pressed his hand over her mouth and slit her throat,” an investigator stated. He then proceeded upstairs, where he ambushed his parents. His mother, who stepped into the washroom, became his next victim. After killing his father, Arjun waited for her to emerge, partially slitting her throat before dragging her to the bed to finish the act.Evidence uncovered by police—including the knife and blood-stained clothing discarded in Sanjay Van during Arjun’s morning walk after the crime—corroborated his confession. Blood traces in washbasins and on the house key further sealed his fate.The victims bore horrifying injuries—throats slit, stab wounds aplenty. In a grim detail, clothing had been placed around their necks, likely in an attempt to stem the flow of blood.Arjun reportedly began his killing spree with his sister, who tried to fight back, as evidenced by the injuries on her body.He then moved to his father, attacking him in his sleep. Lastly, his mother, who had gone to the bathroom, was ambushed as she returned. Arjun used his father’s Army knife to carry out the murders, a weapon chosen for its lethal precision.A neighbour who witnessed him being brought back to the house for the crime’s recreation remarked, “Arjun showed no sign of remorse. He was as calm as always.”","Arjun Tanwar, 20, is accused of killing his father, mother, Komal and sister, Kavita, in their home. Neighbours described him as a reserved and introverted young man.

Stampede at RTC X roads as Allu Arjun arrives for Pushpa 2 premiere

HYDERABAD: Revathi and Mogadampalli Bhaskar's son Sritej, 9, became a fan of Telugu actor Allu Arjun after watching Pushpa: The Rise three years ago. So much so that the family's neighbours nicknamed the little boy ""Pushpa"" for his pitch-perfect delivery of ""Thaggede le"", Arjun's famous catchphrase from the 2021 movie.As Sritej battled for life in a hospital Thursday and his mother's body lay in a mortuary, an inconsolable Bhaskar wondered if 32-year-old Revathi's habit of always putting family above self led to her death the previous night in a stampede at Sandhya theatre where the sequel to the first Pushpa movie premiered.""She gave me life, and now she's gone,"" the 40-year-old said of his wife donating a portion of her liver in 2023 when he needed a transplant.Her last moments, too, were about going out of her way to make her kids happy. Sritej and his younger sister Sanvi had been pestering their parents to take them for a show of Pushpa 2 : The Rule.Wednesday was supposed to be a special movie night for them, with Arjun being in attendance at the premiere of Pushpa 2: The Rule in Hyderabad's Sandhya Theatre. Revathi was with Sritej when the stampede broke out, trapping both in a melee of frantic feet.Bhaskar had moved away with Sanvi sometime earlier because the girl started crying amid jostling by fans desperate for a glimpse of the film star.Breaking down at the thought, Bhaskar said, “I decided to drop Sanvi at my in-laws’ home in the lane next to the theatre. By the time I returned, my wife and son weren’t there where I left them. When I called, Revathi said they were inside the theatre…That was the last I heard her voice.”The bereaved husband believes Revathi was fatally injured in trying to protect their son as the unruly crowd ran hither and thither to escape a police baton charge. Waiting outside the Gandhi Hospital mortuary, Bhaskar was struggling to come to terms with not just the tragedy of his wife’s death. Their son was in a hospital room a few kilo- metres away, still in a critical condition because of “severe hypoxia and potential lung injury”.“I remember someone showing me a video where Sritej was being carried in a stranger’s arms, then being taken in a patrol car that stopped at Chikkadpally police station. He was motionless as they drove him to KIMS Hospital,” said the anxious father. “I didn’t get any updates about Revathi until 2.30am Thursday.

The Russian minister highlighted the tough sanctions imposed on Russia under Trump’s administration, which contradicts the notion of Trump being aligned with Russian interests. ""The number of sanctions we received under the Trump administration was very, very, very big,"" Lavrov added.Lavrov, who has met Trump on several occasions, recalled his experiences during the Trump-Putin meetings . He was invited multiple times to the White House for bilateral talks, where he observed Trump’s direct and practical approach. “He doesn’t like procrastination,” Lavrov said, emphasising the former president's focus on getting things done.However, Lavrov made it clear that his positive view of Trump should not be misinterpreted as support for Russia. This statement comes in the context of the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, where the United States has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine, supplying military aid.=Lavrov also expressed respect for the choice of the American people, saying that Trump’s election and mandate reflected the views of a significant portion of the American population. Despite the challenges in US-Russia relations , Lavrov reiterated that the Russian government respects the democratic process and the people’s choice in electing their leader.Following his 2024 election win, Trump has hinted at reconsidering US military and financial support for Ukraine, possibly cutting aid. This could push Ukraine towards talks, but may also strengthen Russia and damage the US's credibility as an ally.

The turning point:



Image credit: lexica.art

Between early 1692 and mid-1693, the Salem witch trials swept through colonial Massachusetts, with over 200 people accused of witchcraft and 20 executed.While colonial authorities offered pardons and compensation to some of the accused as early as 1711, it wasn't until July 2022 that Elizabeth Johnson Jr—the last of the convicted Salem ""witches"" whose name had not been cleared—was finally exonerated, bringing a long-awaited closure to one of history's darkest chapters.The events began in Salem Village (now Danvers, Massachusetts) in January 1692, when a group of young girls, including Betty Parris (the daughter of the local minister), began exhibiting strange behaviors—fits, convulsions, and violent outbursts.The girls, influenced by Puritan beliefs, claimed they were being tormented by witches. Local doctors attributed their condition to supernatural causes, further stoking fear.As panic spread, accusations of witchcraft began to escalate. The girls accused several local women, including a slave named Tituba, of practicing witchcraft and causing their afflictions. Tituba, after being interrogated and pressured, confessed, which only fueled the hysteria.Once accusations started, they spread rapidly, and many people, often women, were named as witches. The belief was that these witches had made pacts with the Devil, and their evil acts were said to be responsible for various misfortunes, from crop failures to illnesses.The trials began in earnest in the spring of 1692, with Judge Samuel Sewall, Reverend Cotton Mather, and others playing key roles in the prosecution. The accused were often subjected to intense and cruel interrogation methods, including ""touch tests"" (where the accused were forced to touch the afflicted individuals to see if their symptoms were relieved) and the infamous ""swimming test"" (where the accused would be thrown into water to see if they floated—believed to indicate guilt).Evidence in the trials was largely based on "" spectral evidence ""—testimony that the spirit or specter of the accused had been seen committing witchcraft. This form of evidence was highly controversial and unreliable, yet it played a significant role in the convictions.As more and more people were accused, the trials took on a frenzy-like atmosphere. The authorities, believing they were fighting a widespread conspiracy of witches, allowed the trials to continue unchecked. Neighbor turned against neighbor, and personal grudges and rivalries often fueled accusations.By late 1692, the intensity of the trials began to wane. Public opinion started shifting, especially when prominent figures, like Reverend Increase Mather, voiced concerns about the legitimacy of the trials. The governor of Massachusetts, William Phips, intervened, halting the trials and later declaring that spectral evidence would no longer be admissible in court.The trials officially ended in May 1693. 20 people were executed, many others languished in prison, and the entire community was left scarred by the experience.In the years that followed, many of the trial's key figures, including judges, expressed regret for their roles, and several accused individuals were exonerated.In 1711, colonial authorities issued a formal apology and offered restitution to the families of the accused, though it would take until 2022 for Elizabeth Johnson Jr, the last person convicted during the trials, to be posthumously exonerated.","The events began in Salem Village (now Danvers, Massachusetts) in January 1692, when a group of young girls, including Betty Parris, began exhibiting strange behaviors.

Pak sectarian violence: Death toll rises to 130 as clashes continue in Kurram despite ceasefire,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pak-sectarian-violence-death-toll-rises-to-130-as-clashes-continue-in-kurram-despite-ceasefire/articleshow/115868783.cms,"PTI photo

PESHAWAR: The death toll from sectarian violence in Pakistan's restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province surged to 130, with at least six people killed and eight injured on Sunday, as clashes in the volatile Kurram district continued for the eleventh consecutive day.The clashes between Alizai and Bagan tribes in the district started on November 22, after an attack on a convoy of passenger vans near Parachinar in which 47 people were killed a day earlier. Several passengers who had sustained grave injuries succumbed later, raising the toll in the convoy killing to 57.Police said the situation remained tense, and violence persists despite a recent ceasefire agreement between the Sunni and Shia groups.The six new deaths reported on Sunday brought the death toll to 130, while the total number of injured rose to 186 after eight fresh injuries were reported.The 10-day truce brokered last week has been rendered ineffective by intermittent violence, which shows no signs of abating.A high-powered delegation, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Secretary Nadeem Aslam Chaudhry and IGP Akhtar Hayat Gandapur, had also negotiated a ceasefire last weekend, but violence resumed shortly afterwards.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi earlier planned to dispatch members of the grandpeace jirga (council of tribal leaders) from Kohat division to Kurram for engaging with leaders from both warring factions to negotiate peace.Addressing a gathering of political leaders and tribal elders in Kohat on Sunday, he called for strict action with public cooperation to make the region weapon-free through joint operations.He said he was ready to go to Kurram and stay there for as many days as the jirga suggested to ensure peace in the region.""No other country or province will resolve our issues. We must take responsibility for improving the situation ourselves,"" he said.Kundi announced an All-Parties Conference (APC) for peace and the province's rights and invited Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur to join it.The governor stressed the role of religious scholars in promoting peace, urging them to focus on unity.Several other leaders addressed the gathering, putting aside their ideological differences on other issues.The continued violence forced the closure of the main Peshawar-Parachinar Road for travel, and commuting at the Pak-Afghan Kharlachi border has also been suspended.The closure of the main arteries has created a scarcity of oil, food commodities and medicines in the region.The Kurram region is also experiencing a communication blackout, with mobile and internet services suspended and educational institutions closed.Police and other security forces personnel had been deployed in various parts of Lower Kurram, said Deputy Commissioner Javed Ullah Mehsud, adding that all-out efforts will be made for a truce in other areas today as well.""We are hopeful for progress on a ceasefire and reopening of transport routes,"" he stated.Previous efforts to mediate peace, including a seven-day truce brokered by provincial officials in November have failed to hold.","Death toll from sectarian violence in Pakistan's restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province surges to 130.

UK MP Blackman says in Commons debate violence in Bangladesh ‘attempt at ethnic cleansing of Hindus’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-mp-blackman-says-in-commons-debate-violence-in-bangladesh-attempt-at-ethnic-cleansing-of-hindus/articleshow/115945861.cms,"TOI correspondent from London: British Tory MP Bob Blackman described the violence against Hindus in Bangladesh as “an attempt at ethnic cleansing” during a debate in the House of Commons on Monday which followed an urgent question.Blackman said, “Hindus are suffering with their houses being burned, their businesses ransacked. Two further priests were arrested over the weekend, and 63 monks were denied access to the country. This is an attempt at the ethnic cleansing of Hindus from Bangladesh. Will the minister come out and outright condemn this violence?”Indo-Pacific minister Catherine West, representing the govt, said this had all been top of her agenda when she met Bangladesh interim govt chief adviser Muhammad Yunus in Bangladesh in Nov. She said the UK supported the interim govt and was ready to offer advice on law and order.Scores of MPs stood up and said their constituents were concerned about the safety of Hindus in Bangladesh, with some having family there. They called on the UK govt to take every diplomatic stepto protect Hindus and expressed concern the perpetrators of the violence were not being held to account. One MP asked the minister to raise it at the UN.The debate followed an urgent question by Labour MP Barry Gardiner on the situation. Gardiner said there had been more than 2,000 incidents of violence since Aug, mostly targeted against Hindus, and the protections for minority religions guaranteed under Bangladesh’s Constitution “appeared to not be being enforced”.“There are reports of police and army standing by, as more than 20 places of minority Hindu and Sufi worship were vandalised and their worshippers attacked,” he said. “This came to a head on Friday, when extremist groups from the Jamaat-e-Islami party attacked two Hindu temples in Chittagong and conducted a campaign of orchestrated violence against the Hindu population. The situation is clearly on a knife edge.”Regarding the arrest of Iskcon leader Chinmoy Krishna Das, Gardiner said “people are concerned he has been denied due process, charged with sedition and refused bail, yet none of the individuals who attacked the temples has been apprehended or charged.”Democratic Unionist Party MP Jim Shannon said over a 16-day period there had been attacks on 69 Hindu temples. The homes of 157 families were attacked, looted, vandalised or set on fire, and nine Hindus lost their lives.","British Tory MP Bob Blackman described the violence against Hindus in Bangladesh as “an attempt at ethnic cleansing” The debate followed an urgent question by Labour MP Barry Gardiner on the situation.
