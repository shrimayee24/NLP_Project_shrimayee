'Block Everything': Italy’s Pro-Palestine Protests Enter Day 2, 60+ Hurt As Police Clash With Mob

NEW DELHI: Asserting that India needs to demonstrate leadership on the issue of Palestine, Congress Parliamentary Party chairperson Sonia Gandhi on Thursday slammed the Modi government's stance, saying its response has been characterised by a ""profound silence"" and an abdication of both humanity and morality.She said the government's actions appear to be driven primarily by the personal friendship between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu and rather than India's constitutional values or its strategic interests.""This style of personalised diplomacy is never tenable and cannot be the guiding compass of India's foreign policy. Attempts to do the same in other parts of the world, most notably in the United States , have come undone in the most painful and humiliating ways in recent months,"" Gandhi said in her article published in The Hindu.This is the third article by Gandhi on the Israel-Palestine conflict, published in a national daily in the recent past, in which she has vehemently criticised the Modi government's stance on the issue.India's standing on the world stage cannot be wrapped up into the personal glory-seeking ways of one individual, nor can it rest on its historical laurels. It demands persistent courage and a sense of historical continuity, she said in her article titled 'India's muted voice, its detachment with Palestine'.Gandhi pointed out that France has joined the United Kingdom, Canada, Portugal and Australia in recognising Palestinian statehood -- ""the first step in the fulfilment of the legitimate aspirations of the long-suffering Palestinian people"".More than 150 of the 193 countries that are members of the United Nations have now done so, she said.Gandhi underlined that India had been a leader in this regard having formally recognised Palestinian statehood way back on November 18, 1988, after years of support to the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO).She cited the examples of how India raised the issue of Apartheid South Africa even before Independence and during the Algerian struggle for independence (1954-62), India was one of the strongest voices for an independent Algeria.In 1971, India intervened firmly to prevent genocide in what was then East Pakistan, midwifing the birth of modern-day Bangladesh, she pointed out.On the critical and sensitive issue of Israel-Palestine as well, India has long maintained a delicate but principled position, emphasising its commitment to peace and the protection of human rights, the former Congress chief said.India needs to demonstrate leadership on the issue of Palestine, which is now a battle for justice, identity, dignity and human rights, Gandhi asserted.In the last two years, since the outbreak of hostilities between Israel and Palestine in October 2023, India has all but relinquished its role, she opined.""The brutal and inhumane Hamas attacks on Israeli civilians on October 7, 2023, were followed by an Israeli response that has been nothing less than genocidal. As I have previously raised, more than 55,000 Palestinian civilians have been killed, including 17,000 children,"" she said.The residential, schooling and health infrastructure of the Gaza Strip has been obliterated, as have agriculture and industry, Gandhi said.""Gazans have been forced into a famine-like situation, with the Israeli military cruelly obstructing the delivery of much-needed food, medicine, and other aid -- a 'drip-feeding' of aid amidst an ocean of desperation,"" she said.In one of the most revolting acts of inhumanity, hundreds of civilians have been shot down while trying to access food, she pointed out.Gandhi opined that the world has been slow to respond, implicitly legitimising the Israeli actions.The recent moves by several countries to recognise Palestine as a sovereign state are a welcome and long-due departure from the policy of inaction, she said.""This is a historical moment and an assertion of the principles of justice, self-determination and human rights. These steps are not merely diplomatic gestures; they are affirmations of the moral responsibility that nations bear in the face of prolonged injustice.It is a reminder that in the modern world, silence is not neutrality, it is complicity,"" she said.And here, India's voice, once so unwavering in the cause of freedom and human dignity, has remained ""conspicuously muted"", Gandhi said, hitting out at the Modi government.Meanwhile, it is appalling that just two weeks ago, India not only signed a bilateral investment agreement with Israel, in New Delhi, but also hosted its highly controversial far-right finance minister who has invited global condemnation for his repeated incitements of violence against Palestinian communities in the occupied West Bank, she said.Gandhi argued that India must not approach the issue of Palestine as merely a matter of foreign policy but as a test of India's ethical and civilisational heritage.The people of Palestine have endured decades of displacement, prolonged occupation, settlement expansion, restrictions on movement and repeated assaults on their civil, political and human rights, she said.Their plight echoes the struggles that India faced during the colonial era -- a people deprived of their sovereignty, denied a nationhood, exploited for their resources, and stripped of all rights and security.""We owe Palestine a sense of historical empathy in its quest for dignity, and we also owe Palestine the courage to translate that empathy into principled action,"" she said.","Congress Parliamentary Party chairperson Sonia Gandhi slammed the Modi government's stance. She said its response has been characterised by a ""profound silence"" and an abdication of both humanity and morality. This is the third article by Gandhi on the Israel-Palestine conflict published in a national daily in the recent past.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124104383,imgsize-636647,width-400,resizemode-4/file-photo.jpg"

The government said it remained committed to Ladakh’s aspirations.The statement came after Wangchuk defended Congress against Amit Malviya’s charge that the party was behind the violence in Ladakh. Wangchuk said, “Congress doesn’t have that kind of influence here to get 5,000 youth out on the roads. Yesterday, a Congress councillor went to a hospital in anger because two people from his village were brought there injured.”In a post on X, BJP IT Cell head Amit Malviya asked whether Congress leader Rahul Gandhi wanted this kind of unrest in Ladakh.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday ticked off the Union govt for opposing consideration of the plea of condemned prisoner Balwant Singh Rajoana, convicted of killing then Punjab CM Beant Singh in 1995, for commutation of death sentence.Rajoana has petitioned for reprieve on the ground that he has been on death row for nearly two decades now.Additional solicitor general K M Nataraj told a bench headed by Justice Vikram Nath that the President did not take a call on Rajoana's plea as it was filed by others and not by the prisoner himself. The bench, however, was not persuaded.Appearing for Rajoana, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi said that Supreme Court has commuted death sentences of convicts who had been facing the gallows for just two years. ""Here the man has been behind bars for three decades, and two decades under the shadow of a death sentence. If SC commutes his sentence to life imprisonment, he will be released from prison,"" Rohatgi said.He cited an apex court judgment commuting the death sentence of Devinder Pal Singh Bhullar and said the man was convicted for 1993 bomb blasts in Delhi, which had killed nine persons, and had remained on death row since 2001.In 2014, SC commuted his sentence to life term on the ground that there had been an inordinate delay in his execution despite the President rejecting his mercy plea, argued the senior advocate.On Sept 27, 2019, Union home ministry informed the Punjab chief secretary that on the occasion of commemoration of 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev a decision was taken to commute Rajoana's death penalty to life term. But this was not given effect to.Rajoana, who had not appealed against the death sentence given by trial court in 2007 and its approval by Punjab and Haryana HC in 2010, moved SC seeking commutation of his death sentence on the ground that he was in prison for last 25 years and on death row for last 13 years.Rajoana and Jagtar Singh Hawara were awarded death sentences by the trial court for the bomb blast on Aug 31, 1995 which killed Beant Singh and 16 others outside the Punjab and Haryana Civil Secretariat in Chandigarh.","Rajoana has petitioned for reprieve on the ground that he has been on death row for nearly two decades now.

Denmark’s Aalborg airport, which serves both commercial and military flights, was closed early Thursday after drones were spotted in its airspace, police said, two days after Copenhagen airport experienced a similar disruption.Northern Jutland police said, ""more than one drone was seen near Aalborg airport, flying with lights on,"" Reuters reported. The drones were first detected at about 9:44 pm (1944 GMT) on Wednesday and remained in the area at the time of the press briefing early Thursday. Eurocontrol, which oversees European air traffic, said arrivals and departures at Aalborg would be at a “zero rate” until 0400 GMT due to the drone activity.The closure also affected Denmark’s armed forces, as Aalborg is used as a military base. The Danish military said it was assisting local and national police with the investigation but declined further comment. Southern Jutland police later noted on X that drones had also been observed near airports in Esberg, Sonderborg and Skrydstrup, home to Denmark’s F-16 and F-35 fighter jets.Danish national police said the drones followed a similar pattern to those that halted flights at Copenhagen airport for four hours on Monday.Authorities in Norway also closed Oslo airport for three hours Monday after a drone sighting. National police commissioner Thorkild Fogde said many drone reports had been filed since Monday, adding, “Of course many of these reports do not cover activities that are of interest to the police or the military, but some of them do, and I think the one in Aalborg does. ”Police said it was too early to determine “what the goal of the drones is and who is the actor behind,” and added that they would take down the drones if possible. Investigators are working with the national intelligence service, the armed forces, and authorities in other countries. There is no danger to passengers at Aalborg airport or residents in the area, police said, and three flights had been diverted to other airports.Denmark called the Copenhagen airport incident “the most serious attack yet” on its critical infrastructure and linked it to suspected Russian drone incursions and other European disruptions. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the drones were part of a “pattern of persistent contestation at our borders.” Russia’s ambassador to Denmark dismissed suspicions of Russian involvement in the Copenhagen incident as ungrounded.

A strong 6.2-magnitude earthquake struck northwest Venezuela on Wednesday evening, rattling buildings and prompting people to evacuate homes and offices across several states and neighbouring Colombia , according to the US Geological Survey (USGS).The epicentre was located about 24 kilometres east-northeast of Mene Grande in Zulia state, more than 600 kilometres west of Caracas, at a shallow depth of 7.8 kilometres, said the USGS.As per news agency AFP, the area around Mene Grande is sparsely populated, though it remains a critical hub for Venezuela’s oil industry.The quake was felt in major cities, including Caracas and Maracaibo, as well as across the border in Colombia. The Colombian Geological Survey measured the tremor at 6.1 and classified it as a “shallow depth” event, also experienced in Aruba, Curacao and Bonaire, reported AFP.People rushed into the streets as the ground shook, though no major damage or casualties were immediately reported in either country.Interior minister Diosdado Cabello said on state television the tremor was “without significant structural damage”.Communications minister Freddy Ñáñez cited two smaller quakes of 3.9 and 5.4 in Zulia and Barinas states, but did not reference the USGS reading, as per news agency AP The tremor struck near Lake Maracaibo, a critical hub for Venezuela’s oil industry.Although strong earthquakes are relatively rare in the country, about 80 per cent of Venezuelans live in seismic zones.The last major deadly quake occurred in 1997, when 73 people were killed in Cariaco, Sucre state, while a 1976 tremor in Caracas left nearly 300 dead and 2,000 injured.State-run television continued its programming during the quake, including a science segment led by President Nicolás Maduro, AP reported.","A strong 6.2-magnitude earthquake struck northwest Venezuela on Wednesday evening, rattling buildings and prompting people to evacuate.

Travis Decker dead? US Marshals declare army veteran who 'killed' 3 daughters deceased; DNA test awaited,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/travis-decker-dead-us-marshals-service-declares-suspected-child-killer-deceased-sheriff-awaits-dna-confirmation/articleshow/124102287.cms,"



The US Marshals Service has declared Travis Decker, the 32-year-old Army veteran accused of murdering his three daughters, deceased. But Chelan County authorities said on Wednesday that confirmation of his death is still pending DNA results.In a filing this week, federal prosecutors asked a judge to dismiss the case and quash Decker’s arrest warrant. “The United States Marshals Service has advised the Defendant TRAVIS CALEB DECKER is deceased,” the document said. US Attorney S Peter Serrano confirmed the motion followed the Marshals Service’s advice.Chelan County Sheriff Mike Morrison pushed back on the timing of the declaration, calling it premature. “We are currently awaiting DNA test results from the state Crime Lab, which are expected to be returned within the next few days,” his office said. “Once the DNA results are confirmed, the Chelan County Sheriff’s Office will hold a press conference to share findings and address any questions from the media and public. ”Skeletal remains believed to be Decker’s were found last week on Grindstone Mountain at an elevation of 4,000 feet.They were discovered with personal items including clothing, a bracelet, and chewing tobacco. Coroner Wayne Harris said his office must rely on scientific confirmation. “Other agencies can speak about their investigation into Mr. Decker and locating human remains, and can state that based on circumstantial evidence that the remains located are his,” Harris said. “The Chelan County Coroner’s Office does not have that luxury. We must rely on scientific methods to establish positive identification.”Decker had been on the run since June, when the bodies of his daughters — 9-year-old Paityn, 8-year-old Evelyn and 5-year-old Olivia — were discovered at a campground near Leavenworth. Investigators said the girls had been bound with zip ties, suffocated with plastic bags, and their deaths ruled as homicides.The discovery of remains came after a drone search spotted a shirt consistent with what Decker was last seen wearing. Morrison said all signs indicate Decker died in that location some time ago.Arianna Cozart, attorney for Decker’s ex-wife Whitney, said in a statement last week: “We are praying that the remains found are confirmed to be Travis’s. We continue to be grateful for law enforcement’s efforts in this case and are forever appreciative of the entire world’s love, compassion, and support for Whitney.”Decker, a former infantryman who served in Afghanistan, was known to have survival skills and lived out of his truck at times. The manhunt for him became the largest in Chelan County’s history.The US Marshals Service had previously offered a reward of up to $20,000 for information leading to his capture.","US Marshals Service has declared Travis Decker, the 32-year-old Army veteran accused of murdering his three daughters, deceased.

Violence Erupts at Dallas ICE Facility: 1 Dead, 2 Hurt; What Really Happened?

Where did Joshua get the gun from?







Investigators found a bizarre map attached to a car which they believe belonged to 29-year-old Joshua Jahn who killed himself after randomly firing at the ICE centre in Dallas. The map stuck to Joshua's blue Toyota Corolla read ""Radioactive fallout from nuclear detonations have passed over these areas more than 2x since 1951. "" The map under the title looked like the one created by researcher Richard Miller, reports claimed, showing reas of the US over which two or more radioactive clouds have crossed, resulting from nuclear testing in Nevada between 1951-1962.Investigators do not know whether there is any link between the map and the shooter's motive.The Department of Homeland Security confirmed that Joshua opened fire indiscriminately at the ICE building from a nearby roof. One witness said she heard like 20 shots in a row as she was in her car. There was no specific target and the shooter was not a trained one but the FBI confirmed that ICE officials were the target, as one bullet had 'Anti-ICE' written on it. No ICE official was, however, injured and those who were killed by the random firing were detainees.The photo of the bullets posted by FBI director Kash Patel triggered speculation on whether Joshua used a 903 Springfield in .30-06 or an 8mm Mauser rifle.Joshua's brother Noah told NBC News that their parents owned a rifle and Joshua knew how to use it but he was not a marksman. Noah said his brother was not interested in politics on either side. Joshua was unemployed for the time being, though he had done coding work. Joshua was planning to move to their parents' property in Oklahoma, Noah said. Noah said he last saw his brother two weeks ago at his parent’s house, and nothing seemed out of the ordinary.","Joshua Jahn killed himself after randomly firing at the ICE centre in Dallas.

Delhi BMW Crash: Court Denies Bail to Gaganpreet as Lawyer Cites ‘5,000 Accidents a Year’





NEW DELHI: The main accused in the recent BMW accident case, in which a senior finance ministry official died, told a Delhi court on Wednesday that her car did not hit the official's motorbike.The statement was made by Gaganpreet Makkad's counsel during the hearing of her bail plea before judicial magistrate first class Ankit Garg.The judge directed the investigating officer to produce CCTV footage and related documents on Thursday. He also sought the prosecution's response to Makkad's plea for the internet records of the van driver who transported the injured official to the hospital between 1.30 pm and 2.15 pm on the day of the accident.Makkad's counsel argued that she took Navjot Singh—the official who later died—to the hospital within 24 minutes without delay. The lawyer noted that although the FIR stated the car hit the motorcycle from behind, this was not supported by CCTV footage.Describing Makkad's actions as genuine, the counsel said, despite being injured, she made her children, domestic help and husband sit on the footpath while arranging aid for the victim.""The injured were taken to Nulife Hospital in GTB Nagar in about 23–24 minutes. Taking them to AIIMS or Venkateshwar Hospital would have taken 36 minutes—around 4 km further and 12 minutes longer,"" the advocate added.The counsel called the FIR allegations ""an afterthought"", noting it was registered after a 10-hour delay and that the claim of the car hitting the motorcycle was unsubstantiated.""At 1.39 pm, Makkad gave her phone to someone and asked them to call the PCR. She identified herself to the injured and did not flee,"" he said.He argued that Section 105 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of the BNS was wrongly invoked, as there was no intention to cause death. He added that Makkad cooperated with the investigation and fulfilled the criteria for bail.Opposing the bail plea, the public prosecutor said the deceased's wife, who filed the complaint, insisted on being taken to any nearby hospital. He alleged the accused's priority was to avoid legal consequences.","Gaganpreet Makkad's counsel argued that she took Navjot Singh to the hospital within 24 minutes without delay.

AHMEDABAD: A man allegedly set his wife and mother-in-law ablaze at a beauty parlour in Kubernagar area of Ahmedabad on Wednesday over a domestic dispute. The wife, Jaya (32), succumbed to her injuries during treatment, while her mother, Shobhana, was battling for life at Civil Hospital with over 70% burns.According to Sardarnagar police, the accused, Ashok Rajput, arrived at Usha Beauty Parlour—owned by Jaya's aunt Usha Redhani —with a can of kerosene. In a fit of rage, he allegedly doused Jaya and Shobhana with the inflammable liquid and set them on fire before fleeing. Rajput himself sustained burns and is undergoing treatment at Civil Hospital, where police are keeping watch on him.Police inspector M D Champavat said that a case of attempted murder, assault and trespassing was initially registered against Rajput, based on a complaint filed by Jaya's brother, Nilesh Harchomal (30) with Sardarnagar police station. After Jaya's death during treatment, the charge of murder was also added.Harchomal told police that this was his sister's second marriage. Her first marriage took place five years ago but did not last long. Jaya married Rajput in April this year after a brief courtship. However, frequent disputes forced her to repeatedly leave her in-laws' home and return to her maternal house. Just 15 days ago, she had reconciled with Rajput but had again moved back to her parents' house after another quarrel.Locals in the shopping complex where the parlour is located alerted fire services, who helped rescue the Jaya and her mother, and control the blaze.

In a touching moment of history and humanity, King Charles III visited the world’s oldest living person, 116-year-old Ethel Caterham, at Hallmark Lakeview Care Home in Lightwater, Surrey. The meeting took place shortly after the King completed his official duties, including bidding farewell to US President Donald Trump at the end of his state visit and attending several high-level diplomatic events.Unlike formal royal ceremonies, this encounter was deeply personal and heartfelt. For the King, it was an opportunity to pay respect to a remarkable woman whose lifetime spans more than a century of world events and societal transformations, and for Mrs. Caterham, it was the fulfillment of a cherished wish she had expressed—to meet the monarch in person after celebrating her extraordinary milestone birthday.Ethel Caterham was born on 21 August 1909, in Shipton Bellinger, Hampshire, making her a witness to over 11 decades of world history. Her long life has seen humanity transition through wars, revolutions, pandemics, and technological transformations that reshaped the modern world, including the rise of aviation, space exploration, global communications, and major cultural shifts across continents.In April 2025, she officially became the world’s oldest living person following the death of Brazilian nun Sister Inah Canbarro Lucas, who was also 116 at the time of her passing. Beyond her age, what makes Mrs. Caterham’s life even more extraordinary is that she remains the last surviving subject of King Edward VII, connecting her directly to the Edwardian era and Britain’s early 20th-century monarchy, bridging history in a truly remarkable way.Throughout her 116 years, Ethel Caterham has lived through defining moments in global history. As a young child, she grew up in the aftermath of the Edwardian period, only to witness the First World War during her formative years. By the time she was 20, the world was in the grip of the Great Depression, and within a decade, she would see the devastation of the Second World War unfold.She also lived through monumental shifts such as the Russian Revolution, the decline of colonial empires, the rise of modern technology, and most recently, the Covid-19 pandemic. Few people alive today can claim to have seen the world transform in so many profound ways.As BBC reported, when King Charles III greeted Mrs. Caterham, the interaction was filled with warmth and wit. She reminisced about his 1969 investiture as the Prince of Wales, telling him: “I remember when your mother crowned you in Caernarfon Castle.”She went on to add with a smile that during his youth, “all the girls were in love with you and wanted to marry you.” The King responded with laughter and a humorous grimace, joking: “Yes well, all that’s left of him anyway.”This exchange highlighted not only Mrs. Caterham’s sharp memory but also her sense of humor, which continues to shine even after 116 years of life.Ethel Caterham’s personal life is as rich as her historical experiences. She was the second youngest of eight siblings and grew up in Tidworth, Wiltshire. At 18, she moved to India to work as an au pair for a military family, an adventure that shaped her independence at a time when international travel for women was rare.She returned to the UK at 21, where she met her future husband Norman at a dinner party in 1931. Together, they raised two daughters, building a family legacy that now includes three granddaughters and five great-grandchildren.Remarkably, she lived an active life well into her later years, even driving until the age of 97. For the past 50 years, she has made Surrey her permanent home, remaining close to her family.When Mrs. Caterham turned 115 in 2024, she received a personal congratulatory letter from King Charles, praising her for reaching a “truly remarkable milestone.” While her birthday celebration was kept quiet, she expressed that she would have gladly traded the occasion for a meeting with the King.This year, her wish came true. The King’s personal visit underscored the royal family’s long-standing tradition of honoring the nation’s oldest citizens. In the UK, it is customary for monarchs to send birthday greetings to those turning 100 or older, but in Mrs. Caterham’s case, the tribute went even further—a royal encounter in person.Supercentenarians, people who live beyond the age of 110, are extremely rare. There are fewer than 100 verified individuals alive worldwide who have reached this milestone, making Mrs. Caterham’s achievement extraordinary on a global scale. Longevity researchers study individuals like her to understand the genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors that contribute to such remarkable lifespans.In Ethel Caterham’s case, her resilience, sense of humor, and family support appear to be key contributors to her well-being. Her ability to drive until nearly 100 and remain mentally sharp well past her centenary suggests an active lifestyle played a role in her long life.","Ethel Caterham was born on 21 August 1909, in Shipton Bellinger, Hampshire.

Ragasa's next checkpoint





One of the strongest typhoons in Asian history, and also dubbed the 'king of storms', Typhoon Ragasa carved a deadly path across the Philippines, Taiwan, Hong Kong and southern China, leaving behind floods, destruction and mass evacuations.The relentless storm unleashed towering waves, fierce winds and torrential rains before weakening over the Chinese mainland. Here are ten major developments.Eastern Taiwan was hit hardest when a barrier lake burst in Hualien County. Floodwaters swept away a bridge and turned roads into rivers. Seventeen people died, 17 are missing and 32 were injured. In Guangfu township, which has about 8,450 residents, more than half moved to higher floors or safer ground as the water carried away cars and furniture.The storm first made landfall in the northern Philippines on Monday. At least 10 people were reported dead, including seven fishermen who drowned when their boat overturned off Santa Ana in Cagayan province. Five fishermen remain missing. Authorities said nearly 700,000 people were affected, with 25,000 sheltering in government evacuation centres.Hong Kong woke to strong winds and heavy rain as Ragasa passed about 100 km south of the city.The observatory recorded winds of 195 kph, calling it a super typhoon. More than 90 people were injured. Hundreds of trees fell, a vessel hit the waterfront, and waves flooded restaurants and hotels. A viral video showed seawater crashing through the glass doors of the Fullerton Ocean Park Hotel.In China’s Guangdong province, more than 2 million people were evacuated before Ragasa made landfall on Hailing Island near Yangjiang city at 5 pm Wednesday. Winds reached up to 144 kph at landfall. More than 38,000 firefighters and 400 emergency teams were on standby. The government allocated tens of millions of dollars for relief in Guangdong, Hainan and Fujian.In Macao, streets turned into rivers filled with debris. Schools, shops and casinos were closed. Rescue teams used inflatable boats to help people trapped in flooded homes. Power was cut in low areas for safety, and when waters went down, some residents walked into the streets to catch fish.Hong Kong International Airport cancelled more than 600 flights earlier in the week. Shenzhen also suspended flights, though some resumed late Wednesday. Rail services in Guangxi were halted, and roads in affected regions remained blocked. Disneyland, horse races and schools were closed in Hong Kong as residents taped windows and stocked up on supplies.Geologists described the dam burst in Taiwan as a “tsunami from the mountains” after it released about 15.4 million tonnes of water, equal to 6,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools. The floods swept away bridges, submerged cars and left the ground floors of houses underwater, forcing residents to shelter upstairs while waiting for rescue. Though the waters have gone down, thick mud and debris still cover the area, and search teams are going door-to-door to find the missing.Hundreds of thousands of people in southern China began clearing up after Typhoon Ragasa hit Guangdong Province, bringing winds of up to 145 kph. Trees were uprooted, fences destroyed and signs blown off buildings. Around Yangjiang, streets were littered with debris, and some areas still had no electricity. On Hailing Island, relief teams worked to remove a large tree blocking a road while cars navigated muddy tracks to get around the wreckage.Experts pointed to climate change as a driving force behind Ragasa’s strength. Shun Chi-ming, a former director of the Hong Kong Observatory, said, ""Typhoons in the Western Pacific have grown in intensity as a result of higher temperatures in the sea and atmosphere. The warming has caused heavier rains when typhoons make landfall.""Ragasa weakened after hitting southern China but remains dangerous. Forecasters expect the storm to move west towards Vietnam and Laos later in the week. Rescue and recovery operations continue across Taiwan, the Philippines, Hong Kong and Guangdong, where officials warn of significant damage still unfolding.","Typhoon Ragasa hit the Philippines, Taiwan, Hong Kong and southern China.

Chase on the street, cutting throat open





29-year-old Varun Suresh, an Indian-origin man, was arrested in Fremont, California, after he stabbed and killed David Brimmer in front of Brimmer's house. Suresh and Brimmer did not know each other but Suresh told cops that he had wanted for years to kill a sex offender as they hurt children. Suresh chanced upon Brimmer's profile on the California Megha's Law Website, where Brimmer was listed as an offender.""It is not your duty to decide whether Heaven will accept them, it’s your duty to send them to the gates,"" Suresh told the investigators, adding that he did not plan to escape or anything. He knew he would eventually get arrested, but he thought it should be cool as he killed a pedophile.In 1995, Brimmer was convicted of committing ""lewd and lascivious acts"" with a child, for which he was in jail for nine years.After Suresh got Brimmer's address, he armed himself with a knife and decided to pose as a public accountant going door to door looking for new clients. He also carried a bag, a notebook and a coffee. He visited some of the neighbors before going to Brimmer's home. After speaking with Brimmer for some time, Suresh confirmed whether he was Brimmer. When he knew he had the right gut, he took out his knife and grabbed Brimmer.Brimmer ran outside the home, and Suresh ran after him.Suresh told the police that he asked Brimmer during the chase if he believed in God and what his last words would be. Brimmer went inside a neighbor's house and asked them to call the police. Suresh pushed his way and told the neighbor to call the police and report that Brimmer was the ""crazy one"".""It’s over, you have to repent,"" Suresh told Brimmer when he finally caught hold of him in the kitchen when the neighbour asked them to take it outside. Suresh told cops that he finally cut his throat.Suresh told cops that he would have turned himself in if the cops had not come. ""I’m hoping that because [the victim is] a pedophile… like, everyone hates pedophiles… so like, it should be cool. It should be cool,"" Suresh allegedly told investigators, according to court documents.According to reports, Suresh does not have a clean history either. He was arrested in 2021 for making a false bomb threat, criminal threats and burglary for leaving a suspicious bag at Hyatt Place where Fremont police had shot and killed a suspect in an unrelated incident the night before. He later told the cops that he believed the CEO of Hyatt Hotel was a pedophile.","29-year-old Varun Suresh, an Indian-origin man, was arrested in Fremont, California, after he stabbed and killed David Brimmer in front of Brimmer's house.

US President Donald Trump is expected to meet Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif at the White House on Thursday, a Trump administration official told Reuters on Wednesday.The meeting comes weeks after the two countries agreed to a trade deal and follows a brief encounter between the leaders at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.US-Pakistan ties have warmed in recent months under Trump, even as Washington’s relations with New Delhi have been tested over issues such as visa hurdles, high tariffs imposed on Indian goods, and Trump’s repeated claims that he brokered an India-Pakistan ceasefire in May.The United States and Pakistan announced a trade deal on July 31, including a 19% tariff rate imposed by Washington.However, US has yet to reach a similar trade agreement with India.Donald Trump previously hosted Pakistani army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir at the White House, marking the first time a US president met the head of Pakistan’s army without senior civilian officials. “We're working through a number of issues when it comes to counter-terrorism, when it comes to economic and trade ties,” a senior State Department official said. “And so the president remains focused on advancing US interests in the region, that includes through engaging with Pakistan and their government leaders.Asked about frictions with India, the official told Reuters, “Trump believed in being frank about frustrations in ties but the relationship was strong. Washington viewed New Delhi as a good friend and partner and believed their relationship would define the 21st century.” The official added that planning continues for a summit of the Quad grouping of India, Australia, Japan and the United States, expected either later this year or early next year.Sharif also met Trump on Tuesday on the sidelines of the UNGA in a meeting hosted alongside Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, attended by leaders from Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Egypt, the UAE, and Jordan.

Taiwan fatalities

Hong Kong battered







YANGJIANG: Hundreds of thousands of people in southern China were clearing up Thursday after powerful Typhoon Ragasa crashed through Guangdong Province, ripping down trees, destroying fences, and blasting signs off buildings.Ragasa churned into Guangdong, home to tens of millions of people, with winds up to 145 kilometres per hour (90 miles per hour), on Wednesday after sweeping past Hong Kong and killing at least 14 in Taiwan.AFP journalists at the impact point around the city of Yangjiang on Thursday morning saw fallen trees, while road signs and debris were strewn across the streets.A light rain and breeze still lingered as residents worked to clean up the damage.Electricity still had not returned in one residential district, a local restaurant owner told AFP, the roof of his business completely caved in on one side.On Hailing, an island administered by Yangjiang, relief workers attempted to clear a huge tree that had fallen across a wide road.Cars drove on muddy tracks to get around the wreckage as the team worked to saw off branches.Ragasa's passage in Taiwan killed at least 14 and injured dozens more when a decades-old barrier lake burst in eastern Hualien county, according to regional officials who late Wednesday revised the death toll down from 17 after eliminating duplicate cases.Authorities initially said 152 people were unaccounted for, but later made contact with more than 100 of them and were still trying to confirm the actual number of missing.The storm made landfall in mainland China near Hailing Island at around 5 pm on Wednesday.By that point authorities across China had already ordered businesses and schools to shut down in at least 10 cities across the nation's south, affecting tens of millions of people.Nearly 2.2 million people in Guangdong were relocated by Wednesday afternoon, but local officials later said several cities in the province started lifting restrictions on schools and businesses.Chinese state broadcaster CCTV said Ragasa made its second landfall in Beihai, Guangxi, at 6.30 am on Thursday as a tropical storm.Chinese authorities earmarked the equivalent of about $49.2 million to support rescue and relief work in regions hit by Typhoon Ragasa, Xinhua news agency said.Hong Kong authorities said 101 people were treated at public hospitals for injuries sustained during the typhoon as of Wednesday evening, with more than 900 people seeking refuge at 50 temporary shelters across the city.The Chinese finance hub recorded hundreds of fallen trees and flooding in multiple neighbourhoods.Many of the city's tall buildings swayed and rattled in the harsh winds.About 1,000 flights were affected by Ragasa, the airport authority said Wednesday evening, adding that they expected to return to normal operations within the next two days.The top typhoon warning was downgraded in Hong Kong on Wednesday afternoon after being in force for 10 hours, 40 minutes the second-longest on the city's record.Hong Kong's weather service ranked the storm the strongest yet in the northwestern Pacific this year.","Ragasa churned into Guangdong, home to tens of millions of people, on Wednesday after sweeping past Hong Kong and killing at least 14 in Taiwan.

DHAKA: Bangladesh's student-led National Citizen Party (NCP) threatens to halt elections after the Election Commission (EC) refused to allocate the symbol it demanded ahead of the February polls.NCP, a large offshoot of Students against Discrimination (SAD), which led last year's street campaign dubbed as the July Uprising, toppling then prime minister Sheikh Hasina's Awami League and installing professor Muhammad Yunus as the chief adviser.""The commission could not show any legal logic for not allocating the 'shapla' (water lily) as our symbol and therefore we are sticking to our demand,"" NCP's convenor Nahid Islam was quoted as saying on Wednesday by newspapers a day after the EC revealed its decision on the issue.Islam said NCP would give its ""final reaction"" once the EC takes its ""formal decision"".However, the party's chief coordinator for northern Bangladesh, Sarjis Alam, threatened to halt the polls unless their demand was met.""Since there is no legal barrier, the NCP must get the 'shapla' as its symbol; there is no other option. Unless we get it, we will see how the election is held and how someone could dream of attaining power,"" Alam posted on social media.EC's senior secretary, Akhter Ahmed, on Tuesday told a media briefing that NCP would not be allotted the symbol they demanded as it is ""not included in the list of electoral symbols as per the regulations"".""The 'shapla' is not on our list of 115 electoral symbols. According to the rules, political parties must choose a symbol from the approved list,"" he said.The ""shapla"" is the national emblem of Bangladesh.NCP chief coordinator Nasiruddin Patwary led the party delegation to the EC to get its registration earlier and said the party must be registered with the ""shapla"" symbol.Asked how they would secure the symbol since it was not included in the EC's revised list, he said amendments could be made at any time.Patwary also said the party expected to win around 150 constituencies out of 300, with nominations including former army officers, as well as women, farmers, and workers involved in the July uprising.Several political analysts, however, speculate a bleak fate for NCP in elections, particularly after their nominees witnessed a landslide defeat in students' union elections in two major public universities - the premier Dhaka University and suburban Jahangirnagar University.Bangladesh's largest Islamist Party, Jamaat-e-Islami-backed Islami Chhaita Shibir, won in most of the posts in both elections. Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal, the student wing of former prime minister Khaleda Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party, also witnessed an astounding defeat, though it emerged as the second biggest student group in the central students union polls in the two universities.","Bangladesh's student-led National Citizen Party (NCP) threatens to halt elections.

"Drone attack in Haiti slum kills 8 children: Residents blame police for strike; UN-backed mission still short on manpower, funding",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/drone-attack-in-haiti-slum-kills-8-children-residents-blame-police-for-strike-un-backed-mission-still-short-on-manpower-funding/articleshow/124059212.cms,"



A drone attack targeting a suspected gang leader killed at least eight children and injured six others in Cité Soleil, a gang-controlled slum of Haiti’s capital, relatives and activists told The Associated Press on Monday. They blamed police for launching the strike on Saturday night.The explosions struck during a gathering reportedly organised by suspected gang leader Albert Steevenson, known as Djouma, who was preparing to celebrate his birthday. Haiti’s National Human Rights Defense Network said Steevenson was distributing gifts to children at the time.“This is my daughter,” said Claudia Bobrun, 30, showing AP a video of her 8-year-old girl lying in a pool of blood. Tears rolled down her face as she replayed the clip.Residents said at least 13 people died, including civilians and suspected gang members. Victims included the two grandchildren and son of 60-year-old Michelis Florville. “People were running right and left,” he recalled.Nanouse Mertelia, 37, said her son was killed after being caught in the blast. “Come get me, come get me, please mama,” she quoted him as saying before he died from blood loss.The rights group accused police of using two kamikaze drones in the Simon Pelé community of Cité Soleil. Activists added that a similar drone operation in downtown Port-au-Prince earlier this month killed at least eleven civilians.“However, the drones have not targeted terrorist leaders. On the contrary, these leaders have grown more at ease and increasingly arrogant, even moving openly in convoys. Drones must not be selective, and they must also ensure the protection of civilians to avoid collateral damage,” the group said.The attack follows the creation of a new task force earlier this year that operates outside Haiti’s police oversight, relying on certain units and private contractors using explosive drones.It comes as private security firm Vectus Global, linked to former US Navy Seal Erik Prince, prepares to deploy nearly 200 foreign personnel to Haiti under a one-year contract. The government has confirmed it is working with foreign contractors but has not disclosed the terms of the deal.Meanwhile, the UN-backed multinational mission in Haiti continues to face resource shortages, with just 991 personnel deployed against a target of 2,500, and funding standing at $112 million of the $800 million required annually, according to a recent UN report.","The explosions struck during a gathering reportedly organised by suspected gang leader Albert Steevenson, known as Djouma.

Former Vice President Kamala Harris on Monday expressed her support for Zohran Mamdani in New York City’s mayoral race, making her the most prominent Democratic figure to publicly back the democratic socialist candidate.“Look, as far as I’m concerned, he’s the Democratic nominee, and he should be supported,” Harris told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow during an interview promoting her new book, 107 Days.Asked directly whether she was endorsing Mamdani, Harris replied, “I support the Democrat in the race, sure,” without mentioning the candidate by name. She added that Mamdani was “not the only star” running for mayor, highlighting candidates like Barbara Drummond in Mobile, Alabama, and Helena Moreno in New Orleans. “I hope that we don’t so over-index on New York City that we lose sight of the stars throughout our country. So that’s where I am — we’ve got a big tent and we’ve got a lot of stars.”Harris’ comments mark her first major television interview since losing the 2024 presidential election to Donald Trump. Her remarks also come amid caution from other top Democrats. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and New York State Democratic Party Chair Jay Jacobs have withheld endorsement of Mamdani, while New York Governor Kathy Hochul has publicly supported him.Mamdani, a state Assembly member, has received backing from progressive leaders including Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. Some moderate Democrats, however, have voiced concerns that Mamdani’s democratic socialist positions could be used by Republicans to portray the party as too far left ahead of next year’s midterm elections.","Former Vice President Kamala Harris expressed her support for Zohran Mamdani in New York City’s mayoral race, making her the most prominent Democratic figure to publicly back the democratic socialist candidate.

Starbucks BREWS BACKLASH: ‘RACIST’ Splashed On Kirk’s Fav Drink; Barista Booted

Starbucks REACTS On Viral ‘Loser’ Kirk Tribute Cup: Company Says CCTV Footage Says SOMETHING ELSE





An Ohio woman was left shocked after ordering Charlie Kirk’s favourite Starbucks drink and finding a derogatory message written on the cup.Autumn Perkins, of Middletown, Ohio, had visited a Starbucks inside a Kroger store and requested a Mint Majesty with two honeys. When she received her order, an employee had written “racist’s fav drink” on the side of the cup, reported Fox News.“It’s time for people to stop this nonsense,” Perkins was quoted as saying by Fox News Digital.After reporting the incident to the store manager, she learned that the employee admitted to writing the message and was subsequently fired. Perkins said, “I would agree that people should be fired if they're doing something like this. Actions have repercussions. I feel like Charlie stood for respect — we don't have to agree on everything. We can disagree on a lot of things, but we respect each other. We can't communicate and grow if we're disrespecting each other”.Starbucks clarified that writing negative or offensive messages on cups violates company policy.A spokesperson said, “Writing this on a cup is unacceptable, and we have clear policies that prohibit negative messages to help preserve a welcoming environment.This Starbucks location is licensed and operated by Kroger. We understand that this associate was terminated by Kroger”.Kroger confirmed the firing, adding, “This behavior does not reflect Kroger’s values”.The incident comes amid nationwide attention on Charlie Kirk, the Turning Point USA founder who was fatally shot on September 10 while speaking at Utah Valley University. His death has drawn tributes from US President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance, FBI chief Kash Patel and widespread public mourning.Perkins said she would no longer patronise Starbucks following the incident, adding: “I don't intend to spend another penny at Starbucks — and as far as I'm concerned, neither will my children or anybody else in my family who will listen to me”.The episode also echoes a separate incident in California, where a Starbucks barista initially refused to write Charlie Kirk’s name on a cup, citing company policy against political content.Starbucks later clarified that actual names, including Charlie Kirk, are allowed, distinguishing them from political slogans or offensive phrases.","Autumn Perkins, of Middletown, Ohio, had visited a Starbucks inside a Kroger store and requested a Mint Majesty with two honeys.

'Can't silence a majority'





BLACKSBURG: The assassination of political activist Charlie Kirk hasn't slowed his conservative youth movement rather, it has energised it.""What happened ignited something in me. Like, he let down the flag, I've got to pick it up and carry it,"" 16-year-old Kieran Owen told AFP.The Virginia high school student was among 2,500 people attending a Turning Point USA event on Wednesday evening at Virginia Tech University, four hours outside Washington.""We are Charlie ,"" the crowd chanted. Some attendees wore red caps with President Donald Trump 's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan, others doffing white ones with ""47"" reflecting his current White House term.On each seat, organizers had placed a poster featuring a portrait of Kirk against the backdrop of the American flag.Staff at the ""American Comeback Tour"" event wore white T-shirts with the word ""Freedom,"" same as the one Kirk was wearing when he was killed.The 31-year-old was fatally shot in the neck two weeks ago while speaking at a Utah university as part of his popular public debate series.Owen recalled discovering Kirk on social media around the time of last year's presidential election .""He did a live stream... I watched his live stream until like 1 am,"" the soft-spoken teen said.""He really persuaded people.""A Christian with anti-abortion beliefs, Owen had been considering attending the Virginia Tech event before Kirk was killed.""Very shocking to me. No place for that in America,"" he said of the political violence.Kayleigh Finch, wearing a cross and a T-shirt that said simply ""Jesus,"" told AFP it was ""a more important time than ever to attend these kinds of things.""""Show up and be here to show that you can't silence a majority like this,"" she said.Levi Testerman, 18, was attending his first political rally.""I actually kind of looked up to Charlie Kirk,"" he said.""I saw him the first time on TikTok. I really enjoyed his message. I like how he went to college campuses, to talk to younger people, the upcoming voters of America, and I thought it was a great movement.""What happened really affected me... kind of gave me more of a drive to want to come here today to keep the legacy going that I feel he created. And change more people's opinions.""It wasn't only younger people mobilizing following Kirk's death.Melissa Lucas Gardner, a 66-year-old retiree, said she had never heard of Kirk until he was killed.""I never listened to him until this happened. But as they said, it has created a whole new following,"" the former police officer and hospice nurse said.""I didn't know him.

UNITED NATIONS: Turning the page on decades of distance, Syria's president Ahmad al-Sharaa addressed the UN General Assembly, marking the first time any president from his country has done so in almost 60 years. said Wednesday that Syria is returning to the international community after six decades of dictatorship that killed 1 million people and tortured hundreds of thousands. ""Syria is reclaiming its rightful place among the nations of the world,"" he told the assembly's annual gathering.Al-Sharaa became the first Syrian head of state to speak at the UN since Noureddine Attasi gave a speech in 1967 shortly after the Arab-Israeli war, during which Damascus lost control of the Golan Heights that Israel later annexed in 1981.The Assad family dynasty's 50-year rule in Syria abruptly collapsed in Dec, when then-President Bashar Assad was ousted in an insurgent offensive led by al-Sharaa. Al-Sharaa blasted Israel in his speech, saying that it did not stop its threats to his country since the fall of Assad adding that its policies ""contradict with the international community's support to Syria and its people"" in what endangers the region and could make enter conflicts that no one know how they could end.Talks have been under way for a deal that al-Sharaa has said he hopes will bring about a withdrawal of Israeli forces. While al-Sharaa said last week that a deal could be reached in a matter of days, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in remarks Sunday appeared to downplay the odds of a breakthrough.","Ahmad al-Sharaa became the first Syrian head of state to speak at the UN since Noureddine Attasi gave a speech in 1967.

‘Dumb as a rock’: Donald Trump rejects Kamala Harris's claim of 2024 being 'closest election of century'; demands apology,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/dumb-as-a-rock-donald-trump-rejects-kamala-harriss-claim-of-2024-being-closest-election-of-century-demands-apology/articleshow/124100755.cms,"Donald Trump, Kamala Harris (AP)





US President Donald Trump criticized former Vice President Kamala Harris for calling the 2024 election “the closest Presidential Election in the 21st Century,” asserting the statement was false.""Kamala Harris, who is DUMB AS A ROCK, is going around and using, as a standard part of her Speech on why she lost the Election, that 2024 was the “closest Presidential Election in the 21st Century. ” Everyone knows this is a lie, and was covered as such by Fox News!"" Trump said through a post on Truth Social.Trump stated that he won the Electoral College 312-226, carried all seven swing states, and won the popular vote ""by millions"", despite high mail-in ballot numbers in California. He compared this margin to past close elections, including George W Bush’s 2000 victory, which was decided by 537 votes.Trump also reiterated claims that the election was “rigged” in certain states and said he expects an apology from Harris for her comments.Harris, who is currently promoting her new book 107 Days, stated on Tuesday that a key reason for her loss to Trump in the 2024 presidential election was that she “didn’t have enough time” to run an effective campaign.She described the election as “the closest presidential race in the 21st century.” Despite investing $1.5 billion over 15 weeks, her campaign was defeated by Trump in the popular vote, the Electoral College, and in all seven swing states.Harris also cited former President Joe Biden’s late withdrawal from the race in July 2024 as a key challenge. “Biden decides not to run. The sitting vice president then takes the mantle, running against a former president of the United States who had been running for ten years, with 107 days until the election,” she said in an interview with ABC.She reflected on a misstep during an October 2024 interview on The View, acknowledging it hurt her campaign. When asked if she would have acted differently than Biden, she initially responded, “There is not a thing that comes to mind.”In her memoir, she explained that her prepared answer highlighted her bipartisan approach. “I’m not Joe Biden, and I’m certainly not Donald Trump. But to specifically answer your question, throughout my career I have worked with Democrats, independents, and Republicans, and I know that great ideas come from all places. If I’m president, I would appoint a Republican to my cabinet,” she said.",Former Vice President Kamala Harris called the 2024 election “the closest Presidential Election in the 21st Century’ US President Donald Trump said the statement was false.

‘Despicable’: Trump condemns Dallas ICE shooting; attributes rising violence to 'left-leaning' democrats,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/despicable-trump-condemns-dallas-ice-shooting-attributes-rising-violence-to-left-leaning-democrats/articleshow/124099845.cms,"Donald Trump (AP)

Violence Erupts at Dallas ICE Facility: 1 Dead, 2 Hurt; What Really Happened?





US President Donald Trump condemned the deadly shooting at the ICE Field Office in Dallas, Texas, calling the act “despicable” and highlighting that the shooter reportedly wrote “Anti-ICE” on his shell casings.""This is despicable! The Brave Men and Women of ICE are just trying to do their jobs, and remove the “WORST of the WORST” Criminals out of our Country, but they are facing an unprecedented increase in threats, violence, and attacks by Deranged Radical Leftists,"" he said through a post on Truth Social.Trump attributed the violence to what he described as ongoing attacks by left-leaning Democrats, who, he said, have frequently criticized law enforcement, called for the dismantling of ICE, and compared its officers to “Nazis.”He urged Democrats to “stop this rhetoric against ICE and America’s law enforcement” and cited ongoing threats from domestic extremist groups, referencing ANTIFA, which he said has already been designated a terrorist organization. He also announced plans to sign an executive order aimed at dismantling domestic terrorism networks.The US president reaffirmed his administration’s priorities of supporting law enforcement, securing borders, deporting ""violent illegal criminals"", and addressing domestic extremism, framing the measures as necessary to protect officers and maintain public safety.Two detainees were killed and a third injured when a gunman opened fire at a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Dallas on Wednesday, federal authorities reported.The shooter, identified as Joshua Jahn, 29, later died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Law enforcement officials said bullets recovered near Jahn’s body bore “anti-ICE” messages, and the attack appeared to target detainees at random.The shooting occurred at the same ICE field office that recently received a bomb threat, and authorities are investigating whether the two incidents are connected. The Department of Homeland Security confirmed that the location is a field office, not a detention center.","Two detainees were killed and a third injured when a gunman opened fire at a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Dallas on Wednesday.

US special envoy Steve Witkoff said Wednesday that President Donald Trump has shared a 21-point Middle East peace plan with leaders from several Muslim-majority countries.Witkoff added that he expects “some sort of breakthrough” on Gaza in the coming days""We had a very productive session.

We’re going to end it. Maybe we can end it right now,” Trump said before the meeting.The remarks come as dozens of world leaders gathered at the United Nations on Monday to endorse the recognition of a Palestinian state, a landmark diplomatic step nearly two years into the Gaza war, despite strong opposition from Israel and the United States.Netanyahu stated on Wednesday that the recent recognition efforts by some Western nations would “not bind Israel in any way.”""A Palestinian state will not arise,"" the prime minister’s office said through a post on X.Trump is also scheduled to meet Netanyahu in Washington on Monday.The war in Gaza has killed 1,200 people in Israel, mostly civilians, and left approximately 251 hostages, according to official figures.

Poll Do you believe that security measures for trains in Balochistan are adequate? Yes, they are sufficient No, they need improvement





At least 12 people, including women and children, were injured in a bombing attack on the Quetta-bound Jaffar Express in Pakistan’s Balochistan province — the latest in a string of attacks on the train since March.Officials said the blast struck the passenger train as it passed through the Spizend area of Mastung district, causing six carriages to derail and one to overturn on Tuesday. Around 270 people were on board. Security forces rushed to the site and evacuated the injured to a nearby hospital, PTI reported.It was the second explosion in the area within 10 hours. Earlier that morning, an IED went off near the main track linking Balochistan to the rest of the country just as the Peshawar-bound Jaffar Express was preparing to leave Quetta station. That train was cleared to continue because the rails were undamaged.The Jaffar Express, which runs between Quetta and Peshawar, has repeatedly been targeted by separatist groups. On August 10, an IED derailed six coaches of the Peshawar-bound train, injuring four passengers. On August 7, a bomb near Sibi station exploded moments after the train passed; and on August 4 gunmen opened fire on its pilot engine near Kolpur, an attack later claimed by the Baloch Liberation Army.Earlier incidents this year include a remotely controlled blast in June that derailed four carriages in Jacobabad and a March hijacking in Bolan that killed 21 passengers and four security personnel before security forces killed 33 suspected militants in a follow-up operation.Rail officials said repairs to the damaged section of track would begin Wednesday under security clearance, with services temporarily suspended.","The Jaffar Express, which runs between Quetta and Peshawar, has repeatedly been targeted by separatist groups.

Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have a decades-long defence partnership, and while the United States provides the overall security framework, in many cases Pakistan has provided manpower and expertise in the military domain, said a source, recalling that whenever Gulf states have come under threat, whether from Arab nationalism or Iran, they have turned to Pakistan.As per Indian authorities, the Pakistan-Saudi Arabia pact only formalises the existing understandings, particularly on Pakistani support to Saudi Arabia, and that the timeline may have been accelerated by the recent attacks on Doha.Saudi Arabia had first signed a defence agreement with Pakistan in 1967 and upgraded it in 1982 through a bilateral security cooperation agreement. At one point of time, during the Iran-Iraq war, more than 15,000 Pakistani troops were stationed in the kingdom.","Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have a decades-long defence partnership.
