NEW DELHI: At least 5 people were dead and several others, including over 20 police personnel, were injured in Uttar Pradesh 's Sambhal after violent clashes erupted following a court-mandated survey of the Mughal-era Jama Masjid.The survey was ordered following a petition filed by senior advocate Vishnu Shanker Jain , claiming that the mosque was originally a temple.Sambhal district Magistrate issued a notification prohibiting any outsider, social oraganisation or public representative from entering the riot-torn district without the orders of the authorities.""The order number 942 / Judicial Assistant / Section-163 / 2024 dated 01.10.2024 issued by the undersigned has imposed a prohibitory order under Section 163 of the Indian Citizens Security Code, 2023 in district Sambhal, effective until November 30,"" the circular said.""No external person, other social organizations, or public representatives will be allowed to enter the district of Sambhal without permission from the competent authority. This order will be an integral part of the prohibitory order dated 01.10.2024 and will be enforced immediately.

The notice, issued by local SDM, warns that strict action will be taken against anyone found violating this order. Additionally, instructions were given to the Municipal Corporation to confiscate any construction material lying on roads immediately.Around 20 people have been taken into custody following the alleged stone-pelting and clashes that erupted during a survey of a mosque in Uttar Pradesh's Sambhal on Sunday morning, police said.The tension started on Sunday morning as a large group of people gathered near the mosque and started shouting slogans as the survey team began their work in the Shahi Jama Masjid.The protesters tried to torch vehicles and pelted stones at the police who used tear gas and batons to disperse the mob.""Gunshots were fired by the miscreants and some pellets struck our policemen. We are investigating where the shots were fired from, particularly in the Deepa Sarai area,"" an officer said.Tension has been brewing in Sambhal over the past few days after the Jama Masjid was surveyed last Tuesday on the orders of a local court following a petition that claimed that a Harihar temple stood at the site.""Some miscreants in the crowd threw stones at the police team.

The accused will also be booked under the NSA,"" the police officer added.Petitioner Vishnu Shankar Jain had said the Court of Civil Judge (Senior Division) ordered the constitution of an ""Advocate Commission"" to survey the mosque. The court has said that a report should be filed after conducting a videography and photography survey through the commission, he had said.The Central and Uttar Pradesh governments, the mosque committee and the district magistrate of Sambhal have been made parties in the petition concerning the mosque, Jain.Uttar Pradesh minister Yogendra Upadhyay condemned the stone pelting at an ASI team surveying a Mughal-era mosque in Uttar Pradesh's Sambhal and asserted that everyone has to live according to law and order under UP CM Yogi Adityanath 's governance.""I condemn this action. It is reprehensible to disobey the order given by the court. Failure to follow the court's order is a big crime... Under Yogi Adityanath's rule, everyone has to live according to law and order, despite their class or status in society,"" Upadhyay said.Union minister Giriraj Singh reacted to the stone pelting incident on the survey team and said that it was not just an assault on the government but an attack on India's democracy and rule of law.Singh criticised the community responsible for the attack, accusing them of showing distrust in the country's democratic institutions and emphasized that the nation will not tolerate such actions.""The attack that was carried out by a community in Sambhal and that too on the government machinery, this attack is not on the government machinery but on the democracy and law of India on which they do not trust. Now the country will not tolerate how this attack was carried out,"" Singh said,Meanwhile, Congress alleged that the Yogi Adityanath administration is squarely responsible for killing innocents and only the BJP-RSS is guilty of ""setting fire"" to the peace and harmony there.The opposition party said the videos of direct firing on the protesters in Sambhal depict the horrifying result of a ""well-planned conspiracy"" by Adityanath and the BJP-RSS.""In this entire matter, the BJP neither wanted the survey to proceed nor to stop it; its sole objective was to destroy harmony,"" Khera said.""No citizen in Uttar Pradesh is 'safe' under CM Adityanath, who gave the reprehensible slogan of 'Batenge toh Katenge'. This is evident by the highly deplorable incidents of Sambhal today,"" he added.Western Uttar Pradesh, which has been a symbol of goodwill and harmony for years, has today witnessed three people killed and many injured under a ""well-planned conspiracy"", the Congress leader said.""We say with full responsibility that the Adityanath administration is squarely responsible for killing innocents and only the BJP-RSS is guilty of setting fire to the peace and harmony of Sambhal. Modi-Yogi 'double assault' governments, which consider the minority community as second-class citizens, hurriedly got a petition filed in court,"" Khera said.It is public knowledge that the court ordered an immediate survey without hearing the other side, he said.""No action was taken against the rioters who accompanied the survey team. This makes it clear that after the by-elections in the state, the Yogi government has further intensified the politics of violence and hatred,"" he added.Khera said Rahul Gandhi has been continuously and stridently talked about 'Nafrat Ke Bazaar Mein Mohabbat Ki Dukaan' and in such a situation, an appeal is made to the people of Sambhal to recognise the politics of hatred, maintain mutual unity, amity and harmony, and take steps to protect their rights in a legal manner.","At least 5 people were dead and several others, including over 20 police personnel, were injured in Uttar Pradesh's Sambhal.

Public safety and national security



Role of US military



Encouraging voluntary deportation



US President-elect Donald Trump’s newly appointed border czar, Tom Homan, is set to lay the groundwork for a comprehensive deportation plan that aims to address the ongoing immigration crisis in the United States. Homan, who will take office in January, spoke to The Center Square about his strategy, which includes prioritising the removal of illegal immigrants, many of whom he argues should have already been deported under previous administrations.Homan’s approach marks a stark contrast to that of vice president Kamala Harris, who currently holds the position of the Biden administration's border czar.Harris has repeatedly insisted that the US border is secure and stated that there was no immediate need for intervention. Under the Biden administration, however, the US has witnessed record numbers of illegal border crossings, with about 14 million reported, the highest in US history, according to Center Square.“The overarching theme,” Homan said, “is millions of people entered this country illegally, which is a crime,"" as reported by the New York Post. He stressed that while the Biden administration has argued that illegal immigrants have a right to claim asylum, data shows that nearly 90% of those who go before an immigration judge are ordered to be removed from the US due to a lack of qualifying claims.Homan believes that given the large number of individuals ordered for removal, the nation needs a “mass deportation operation,” saying, “Are these dirty words? No. On the end of historic mass illegal immigration with nine out of 10 getting orders for removal, there has to be a mass deportation programme.”Homan outlined the key priorities of his deportation plan, which will focus on individuals who pose a threat to public safety, national security, or who have become fugitives after being ordered to leave. This includes individuals on the federal Terrorist Watch List, as well as those from countries of foreign concern, who are considered high-risk, as per HomanWith a record number of individuals on the terrorist watchlist crossing the border, Homan has warned that the current crisis is the biggest national security threat since the September 11 attacks. He confirmed that efforts would be made to work closely with the FBI and intelligence agencies to identify and locate these individuals.In his efforts to enforce the deportation strategy, Homan revealed that the US military will be involved, although it will not be carrying out arrests. “The military will provide air and ground transportation assistance, work on construction building and intelligence targeting,” Homan said. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), US Border Patrol, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents will continue to have the legal authority to make arrests.Homan added that the Department of Defence (DOD) has assisted in border enforcement across various administrations, and under his leadership, that support will be expanded to non-law enforcement duties as well. “They can do all kinds of things that don’t require immigration authority,” he said.Homan also encouraged foreign nationals currently in the US illegally to voluntarily return to their countries of origin before facing formal deportation orders. “If you’re in the country illegally and you’ve got an order for removal, or even if you don’t have one, if you’re in the country, leave on your own,” he advised. Voluntary departure, he said, would prevent penalties, including a 20-year ban from re-entering the US.Homan made it clear that under his leadership, the Trump administration will take a hardline stance on immigration, warning those who entered illegally that they would be held accountable. “You better start packing now. Because you are going home,” he said.","US President-elect Donald Trump’s newly appointed border czar, Tom Homan, is set to lay the groundwork for a comprehensive deportation plan that aims to address the ongoing immigration crisis in the United States.

People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ( PETA ) came to Washington D.C.'s streets to slam President Joe Biden for his Turkey pardon ahead of Thanksgiving.PETA's ""Hell on Wheels"" turkey lorry, which has toured 30 states since October, features recordings and messaging aimed at raising awareness. The vehicle, designed to replicate a turkey transport vehicle with images of confined birds, was stationed outside the Willard Hotel where the pardoned turkeys stayed before the ceremony.The lorry later positioned itself near the White House.""It's a life-sized Turkey transportation truck, and it's covered with images of real sickly turkeys. And if people listen very closely, they will hear a subliminal message to go vegan every 10 seconds. And that's because we want people to listen closely and watch closely, because every turkey is an individual,"" Amanda Brody, assistant manager in PETA's international grassroots campaigns department, told Fox News Digital.""No one needs to eat meat, dairy or eggs to be healthy, and everyone can help stop this needless suffering by simply going vegan today or enjoying a vegan roast at their Thanksgiving dinner this Thursday.""PETA's President Ingrid Newkirk recently wrote to President Biden, requesting the ""lame duck president"" to end what she termed the ""wretched"" pardoning custom.Newkirk argued the tradition is ""a humiliating meat-industry stunt that uses the White House as its public relations backdrop.""""Turkeys are devoted parents who purr to their chicks, and whose skin changes colour to express their emotions, yet in the meat industry, they're treated as unfeeling objects, crammed into filthy sheds, and slaughtered, often while they're still conscious,"" Newkirk said Monday.""PETA's 'Hell on Wheels' truck is sending a strong signal that it's beneath the Oval Office to shill for the meat industry and appealing to the public to please give birds a break by choosing vegan this Thanksgiving and beyond,"" Newkirk added.The origins of this presidential custom remain unclear.

Why hundreds of Pakistanis are ready to 'do or die' for jailed ex-PM Imran Khan?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/why-hundreds-of-pakistanis-are-ready-to-do-or-die-for-jailed-ex-pm-imran-khan/articleshow/115677398.cms,"Image credit: AP

When Khan invoked Tipu Sultan to announce protests



What is Bushra Bibi's Saudi Arabia connection



With over hundreds of supporters of jailed ex-PM Imran Khan marching towards Islamabad, Pakistan is voicing its dissent against the current Shehbaz Sharif government demanding the release of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leader.The government is determined to suppress the protest with force, which was initially set for November 24. However, the convoys paused overnight after PTI leaders announced they were ""in no hurry"" to reach the federal capital for their high-stakes protest.Meanwhile, workers and supporters from across the country have been attempting to defy arrests, baton charges, and tear gas as they join the demonstration.The United States urged both Pakistani authorities and the thousands of protesters marching on the capital to exercise restraint in their actions.""We call on protesters to demonstrate peacefully and refrain from violence and, at the same time, we call on Pakistani authorities to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms and to ensure respect for Pakistan's laws and constitution as they work to maintain law and order,"" state department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters.The protests, so far, have seen the death of a cop, with several people being injured on both the sides. Internet and mobile services have been shut down as the government is adamant to suppress this “well-thought-out conspiracy.”Over 1,257 party workers have been detained, and nearly 200 arrested while attempting to march towards Islamabad in response to the party’s call for action, according to ARY news.In a rallying call to the nation, Imran Khan declared November 24 as the day to ""break free from slavery,"" emphasizing the suspension of the rule of law, the constitution, and human rights in the country.“November 24th is the day to break free from slavery. The rule of law, constitution, and human rights are suspended in Pakistan, forcing the nation to come out to protest and make sacrifices. The nation must decide whether to wear the yoke of slavery like Bahadur Shah Zafar or to adorn the crown of freedom like Tipu Sultan,"" he said in a post on X.The former prime minister has claimed that his imprisonment is part of a political strategy orchestrated by the military and the ruling government to prevent him from regaining power. Khan and his PTI party have also alleged widespread rigging in the February elections, where they assert they won the popular vote, and are now calling for free and fair elections.Multiple cases have been filed in Pakistan's Punjab province against Bushra Bibi, the wife of Imran Khan, religious hatred, misleading the public, and attacking the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia through her statements, which Khan claims was ""deliberately taken out of context.""At least four cases were registered under the Telegraph Act of 1885 and other legal provisions following a video statement in which, Bibi claimed that the problems faced by her husband began after his visit to Madina, where he was seen exiting his plane without shoes.“Soon after Khan’s return, former army chief Bajwa started getting calls Ye tum kya utha key ley aaye ho (whom have you brought)? We are ending the Sharia system in this country and you have brought promoters of Sharia,” she said in the video.Defying these accusations, Khan said, ""Bushra Bibi's statement was deliberately taken out of context to draw our brotherly country KSA into a needless controversy. She didn't mention Saudi Arabia at all.""The ruled and the ruler coming face to face is a deja vu for South Asia with Bangladesh recently witnessing the ousting of its serving PM Sheikh Hasina, who fled to India after massive violent protests marred the streets of Indian neighbour.","Hundreds of supporters of jailed ex-PM Imran Khan are marching towards Islamabad.

A plane crash in the snowy woods of the Catskill Mountains, claimed the lives of a pilot and a rescue dog he was transporting, while two other dogs on board survived, as authorities reported.Seuk Kim, 49, was flying from Maryland to Albany, New York, on Sunday evening when his small plane crashed in a remote area near Windham, about 35 miles southwest of Albany.Kim, a volunteer pilot from Springfield, Virginia, was transporting three rescue dogs for a non-profit organisation.Preliminary investigations indicate Kim died on impact, according to Greene County Sheriff Peter Kusminsky. Poor visibility and turbulence were reported prior to the crash, with Kim seeking permission to change altitude moments before the accident.Among the three dogs on board, two survived. Whiskey, a Labrador-mix puppy with broken bones, was found buried in the snow and has since been taken to a veterinary hospital in Connecticut's Middleton. Pluto, an 18-month-old Yorkie terrier mix, suffered only minor injuries.Kim, a South Korean immigrant, was widely praised for his dedication to animal rescue. He had volunteered for years with organisation that transport animals from overcrowded shelters, often saving them from euthanasia.“Seuk helped save hundreds of animals over the years,” said Maggie Pryor, director of the Animal Shelter of Schoharie County, the organization Kim was flying for. “His selflessness made an immeasurable impact.”Cathay West of Kuddles & Kisses K9 Rescue in Baltimore remembered Kim as a tireless advocate. “He worked so hard to spread the word about volunteering and saving dogs,” she said.Tributes poured in from fellow rescuers and friends on Monday, lauding Kim’s generosity and dedication to his mission. His family described him as a “selfless individual” whose legacy would live on through the lives he touched, both human and animal.The Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the crash. Rescuers found the wreckage late Sunday in a snow-covered forest, about two miles from the nearest road.","Seuk Kim, 49, was flying from Maryland to Albany, New York, on Sunday evening when his small plane crashed in a remote area near Windham, about 35 miles southwest of Albany.

The two women fought over Owens' children playing near Lorincz's property.The dispute between the neighbours had been ongoing for some time.Owens, a mother of four, had gone to Lorincz's door to confront her about allegedly throwing objects at her children—something Lorincz denied. According to testimony, Owens was pounding on Lorincz’s door when she fired a single shot through it.Lorincz claimed she acted in self-defence, saying she feared for her life and had been harassed by Owens for years. However, the jury did not accept this claim.Despite facing up to 30 years in prison, Lorincz received a slightly reduced sentence from Circuit Judge Robert Hodges, who took into account her troubled childhood and mental health issues. ""The shooting was completely unnecessary in this case,"" Judge Hodges said. ""The shooting, I find, was based more in anger than in fear.""In a statement to the court, Lorincz expressed regret over the tragedy, saying, ""I so wish I could go back and change things so she was still here. I never intended to kill anyone.""Owens' family, who pushed for the maximum sentence for Lorincz, shared their grief over the loss, with Owens' mother, Pamela Dias, saying, “We’re hurting with a pain that will never, never go away.”Lorincz’s lawyer argued for a lighter sentence, citing her mental health and claiming Owens was the aggressor. However, the judge emphasised the lasting impact on Owens' children, who will grow up without their mother.","Susan Lorincz, 60, was convicted in August for killing 35-year-old Ajike “A.J.” Owens in June 2023.

Trump Jan 6 Case: Jack Smith files motion to dismiss Jan 6 case against Donald Trump before his inauguration,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jack-smith-files-motion-to-dismiss-jan-6-case-against-donald-trump-before-his-inauguration/articleshow/115670335.cms,"Jack Smith asked the court to drop election intereference charge against Donald Trump before his inauguration on January 20.

Special counsel Jack Smith Monday asked a federal judge to dismiss the four charges against President-elect Donald Trump of plotting to overturn the 2020 election before his inauguration on January 20. Smith cited longstanding Justice Department policy shielding presidents from prosecution while in office as he moved the motion. In court papers. prosecutors said the Justice Department's position ""is that the Constitution requires that this case be dismissed before the defendant is inaugurated.”“It has long been the position of the Department of Justice that the United States Constitution forbids the federal indictment and subsequent criminal prosecution of a sitting President,” Smith’s team wrote in a filing.Donald Trump reacted to the legal victory and called for an immediate end to the weaponization of the justice system. ""The American People re-elected President Trump with an overwhelming mandate to Make America Great Again. Today's decision by the DoJ ends the unconstitutional federal cases against President Trump, and is a major victory for the rule of law. The American People and President Trump want an immediate end to the political weaponization of our justice system and we look forward to uniting out country,"" Trump's communications director Steven Cheung said.The decision was expected after Smith's team began assessing how to wind down both the 2020 election interference case and the separate classified documents case in the wake of Trump's victory over Vice President Kamala Harris. The Justice Department believes Trump can no longer be tried going by the longstanding policy that says sitting presidents cannot be prosecuted.The 2020 election case brought last year was once seen as one of the most serious legal threats facing the Republican as he vied to reclaim the White House. But it quickly stalled amid legal fighting over Trump’s sweeping claims of immunity from prosecution for acts he took while in the White House.The US Supreme Court in July ruled for the first time that former presidents have broad immunity from prosecution, and sent the case back to US District Judge Tanya Chutkan to determine which allegations in the indictment, if any, could proceed to trial.The case was just beginning to pick up steam again in the trial court in the weeks leading up to the November 4 election. Smith’s team in October filed a lengthy brief laying out new evidence they planned to use against him at trial, accusing him of using “resorting to crimes” in an increasingly desperate effort to overturn the will over voters after he lost to President Joe Biden.(With agency inputs)",Donald Trump reacted to the legal victory and called for an immediate end to the weaponization of the justice system.

A parachute has been linked to the infamous hijacker, who checked in as Dan Cooper on 23 November, 1971, escaped into thin air with ransom money, has been found. On the crime’s anniversary, McCoy’s children have claimed to have found the parachute Cooper allegedly used.The parachute was discovered in the garage of Richard Floyd McCoy II, a man many believe was DB Cooper.The FBI which closed the case in 2016 is now investigating this new clue. DB Cooper hijacked a Northwest Orient Airlines flight 53 years ago, demanding $200,000 in ransom, and escaped by parachuting out of the plane.Richard McCoy was previously linked to another plane hijacking, where he escaped with $500,000, strengthening suspicions about his connection to the Cooper case.After their mother’s death, McCoy’s children contacted YouTuber Gryder in 2022. Gryder, who studies the case, said the military parachute found in their father’s garage could be real, calling it 'one in a billion.' The siblings believe their father might have been Cooper and suspect their mother also knew about the crime.On Monday, Gryder shared a video stating that the FBI had reopened the investigation. He said agents contacted him after seeing his earlier videos about the parachute discovery.Cooper, dressed in sunglasses, a suit, and a tie, demanded $200,000 and four parachutes, promising to release 36 passengers once the items were ready in Seattle. After receiving them, he ordered the plane to take off toward Mexico. Over southwestern Washington, he opened the rear exit, leaped into the night with two parachutes and the cash, and vanished. Delayed police searches yielded no trace, and he was never seen again.This is the FBI’s first activity on the case since 2016. Gryder’s friend, retired pilot Laura Savino, confirmed the FBI is taking the matter seriously. So far, the FBI hasn’t returned the parachute, adding to the belief that it might be crucial evidence.","DB Cooper hijacked a Northwest Orient Airlines flight 53 years ago, demanding $200,000 in ransom, and escaped by parachuting out of the plane.

Why did Gaetz stepped down?

US President-elect Donald Trump has endorsed Jimmy Patronis, Florida’s former chief financial officer (CFO), to take over Matt Gaetz’s seat in Congress, as reported by the Independent. Gaetz stepped down after facing allegations of sexual misconduct and a federal investigation into sex trafficking. He also withdrew his bid to become Trump’s attorney general, calling the controversy a distraction.Trump took to Truth Social to praise Jimmy Patronis as a “fourth-generation Floridian” and a dedicated ally to the MAGA movement .“Jimmy Patronis, chief financial officer for the Great State of Florida, has done a tremendous job as CFO, where he also serves as the State’s Fire Marshal, and as an important member of the Florida Cabinet. I hear that Jimmy is now considering launching a campaign for Congress in Florida's 1st Congressional District!” Trump wrote.“A fourth-generation Floridian from the beautiful Panhandle, and owner of an iconic seafood restaurant, Jimmy has been a wonderful friend to me, and to MAGA. As your next Congressman, Jimmy would work tirelessly alongside of me to Grow our Economy, Secure our Border, Stop Migrant Crime, Strengthen our Incredible Military/Vets, Restore American Energy DOMINANCE, and Defend our always under siege Second Amendment,” he added.“Should he decide to enter this Race, Jimmy Patronis has my Complete and Total Endorsement. RUN, JIMMY, RUN!” Trump concluded, putting his full weight behind Patronis.In response, Patronis stepped down as CFO on Monday and declared his intention to run for Florida’s 1st district seat. On X (formerly Twitter), he said, “Put me to work, Mr. President. @realDonaldTrump I am here to serve.” Florida governor Ron DeSantis announced the dates for the special election to fill Gaetz’s seat. The primary is set for January 28, with the final election on April 1.Patronis, a Panama City-based restaurateur and Trump loyalist , has held public office since 2017. Earlier this year, he backed the “Freedom Fighters Fund,” a proposed bill aimed at aiding Floridians, including Trump, facing legal battles. The legislation, however, was shelved following opposition from DeSantis.Within hours of stepping down, Patronis announced his candidacy for Florida’s Congressional District 1, which covers parts of Escambia, Okaloosa, Santa Rosa, and Walton counties.Gaetz, 42, resigned earlier this month amid allegations of sexual misconduct and drug use, just as the House Ethics Committee was set to release a “highly damaging” report on its investigation. Although Gaetz denied the allegations, he described them as a “smear” and called the confirmation process for his attorney general nomination a “distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition.”Despite his resignation, the Ethics Committee has not released its report, citing the conclusion of its investigation. Former Trump adviser John Bolton called Gaetz the “worst cabinet-level appointment in history.”Gaetz’s withdrawal paved the way for Trump to nominate Pam Bondi, a former Florida attorney general, as his pick for attorney general. Meanwhile, Gaetz has yet to announce his next career move.As Patronis steps into the political spotlight, he brings with him a reputation as a loyal Trump ally eager to carry forward the MAGA agenda.",US President-elect Donald Trump has endorsed Jimmy Patronis to take over Matt Gaetz’s seat in Congress.

Tens of thousands of PTI protesters reach outskirts of Islamabad,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/tens-of-thousands-of-pti-protesters-reach-outskirts-of-islamabad/articleshow/115669575.cms,"The anti-government 'Final Call' protest rally of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), that started from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Peshawar on Sunday, has now reached the outskirts of Islamabad where massive security arrangements have been made to prevent its entry into the country's capital.

ISLAMABAD: Amid fierce teargas clashes with law enforcement personnel, tens of thousands of protesters of the Imran Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) reached the outskirts of the capital, Islamabad, on Monday to demand the release of their incarcerated party chief, with his wife Bushra Bibi saying the demonstration would continue until the former PM was released from jail.Vowing not to allow the protest, the govt has blocked all routes into and out of Islamabad with shipping containers, and heavy contingents of police and other security forces have been deployed across the capital city. The protesters, however, intend to set up camp at Islamabad D-Chowk, a large square near a number of significant govt buildings, including the PM’s office, parliament and the Supreme Court.Imran has billed the ongoing protest as the “final call” to meet three demands — his release from jail, along with hundreds of party workers who were detained over the last two years, reversal of the 26th Constitutional Amendment which curtailed the powers of the judiciary, and the return of the “stolen mandate” of the Feb 8 elections.A convoy of protesters from the south-western province of Balochistan, which has travelled for four days and includes women and children, has been waiting at Islamabad’s entry point for other convoys to reach and then collectively march to the capital. “We are waiting for the main convoy, led by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa CM Ali Amin Gandapur, to arrive,” said Shahjehan Bazai, a PTI supporter. Imran’s wife has been part of the convoy led by Gandapur.“As long as Imran is not with us, we will not end this march,” she told supporters at a stop near the Hazara Interchange. “I will stay there till my last breath, and all of you have to support me. This is not just about my husband but about the country and its leader,” said Bushra, who was sentenced alongside Khan in Jan but released on bail in late Oct.Tensions between the two sides escalated into violence on Monday when thousands of people resumed their march towards the capital. Clashes erupted in the city’s suburbs, with footage showing PTI supporters setting police vehicles ablaze and hurling stones. Police shot tear gas at protesters who responded with slingshots.The party claimed that many of its members have been arrested in crackdowns across Pakistan. “We have already detained more than 4,000 Khan supporters, including five parliamentarians,” said Shahid Nawaz, a senior police officer in eastern Punjab.Pakistan interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said authorities would arrest more of Khan’s supporters if they reach Islamabad’s Red Zone (D-Chowk), which has been sealed off. “Anyone reaching it will be arrested,” he said.The protest, which govt is determined to foil with force, was originally scheduled to be staged on Nov 24, but the convoys took a breather last night after PTI leaders said they were in “no hurry” to reach the federal capital for their “do or die” protest as workers and supporters from across the country attempted to defy arrests, baton charges and tear gas to participate in the agitation.","Tens of thousands of protesters of the Imran Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) reached the outskirts of the capital, Islamabad, on Monday.

Hundreds of supporters of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan converged on the outskirts of Pakistan’s capital, Islamabad, on Monday, demanding his release and vowing to march on parliament for a sit-in protest.Authorities imposed a strict security lockdown, erecting barricades on highways to block the demonstrators, as Khan’s party reported clashes and unrest in other parts of the country.As the protests continue, one policeman has been reported killed. Numerous individuals from both sides have also sustained injuries during violent confrontations between Imran Khan's followers and security personnel near Islamabad on Monday. The casualties were confirmed by both a government minister and representatives from Khan's political party, according to Reuters.In regards to the protest, in an update provided Monday evening, PTI said that the convoy from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa entered Islamabad while others are expected to reach as soon as the obstacles clear.""The convoy of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa entered the limits of Islamabad! Convoys are reaching Islamabad from all over Pakistan. We did not stop until we reached Islamabad,"" said PTI. ""Where there are obstacles, as soon as they are removed, those caravans will again leave for Islamabad. These caravans will hit Islamabad like tsunami waves every day. This will continue until we win Khan's demands and the war for true freedom. We will not stop, we will not bend. We will persist. And will remain steadfast. Will die freed!"" added the party.Khan’s wife Bushra Bibi, also a part of the march, addressed the rally near Hazara Interchange saying, “My brothers, we will not end this march till Imran is not with us,” she said. “I will stay there till my last breath, and all of you have to support me. This is not just about my husband but about the country and its leader.”The procession is being headed by KP Chief Minister Amin Ali Gandapur. Several PTI officials, including Sanam Javaid Khan, Babar Saleem Swati, Faisal Javed, and Omar Ayub Khan were also part of the demonstration.Speaking to Dawn.com at Attock's Burhan Interchange, PTI's Shaukat Yousafzai confirmed the advancing convoys, noting their slow progress due to size and obstacles. He claimed police retreated upon seeing the “huge rally.” Yousafzai confirmed Gandapur’s intention to reach D-Chowk “peacefully but at any cost.” He added that the party would continue its protest until “innocent political prisoners,” including Khan, are released. Yousafzai criticized the government as incompetent, focused only on “baton-charge the public and block the roads.”PTI’s Barrister Gohar also affirmed the protest would continue. “This is Khan sahib’s final call, there is no such thing of calling this off,” he stated. Roads leading to Islamabad’s red zone, except for Margalla Road, are blocked.Punjab Information Minister Azma Bukhari questioned the effectiveness of the protest. “In this ‘final call’ […] I don’t think there will be a bigger disappointment than this,” she remarked. Bukhari noted approximately 80 arrests were made during Sunday’s protests in Punjab.The protest, initially scheduled for November 24, was delayed. The Islamabad High Court ruled the protest unlawful and directed the government to maintain order, especially with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko’s arrival in Islamabad for a three-day visit. PTI leader Asad Qaiser said the march would take a few days to reach Islamabad.Police used tear gas against protesters near Attock, who responded by throwing stones and setting a toll booth and van on fire. However, PTI brought large industrial fans to counteract tear gas. Ikram Khattana, PTI’s social media head in KP, said six locally manufactured fans are part of the Peshawar convoy, as reported by Dawn.The administration remains firm on preventing protesters from entering Islamabad. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi announced arrests for any attempting entry. Deputy PM Ishaq Dar called the protest a “well-thought out conspiracy,” noting its timing coincided with Lukashenko’s visit.Additionally, provincial Information Minister Uzma Bukhari, whilst confirming that authorities had detained approximately 80 of Khan's followers said, ""We wouldn't let them storm the capital.""The demonstration, which Khan termed as the ""final call"", represents one of numerous rallies organised by his party advocating for his freedom since his imprisonment in August last year. Their previous demonstration in Islamabad in early October resulted in unrest.Khan, who was removed from power through a parliamentary vote in 2022 following disagreements with Pakistan's influential military establishment, faces various accusations including corruption and incitement to violence, all of which he and his party consistently reject.","Hundreds of supporters of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan converged on the outskirts of Pakistan’s capital, Islamabad, on Monday.

They include five parliamentarians. Pakistan has sealed off Islamabad with shipping containers and shut down major roads and highways connecting the city with PTI strongholds in Punjab and northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces.

He revealed that both sides had raised militias soon after Thursday’s incident.A local administration official said the dead in the latest clashes included 18 Shias and 14 Sunnis. Nearly 50 others were wounded in overnight fighting.Dr Qaisar Abbas, a district health officer in Kurram, confirmed the casualties and described the condition of nine wounded as serious.Eyewitnesses said armed men broke into stores, petrol stations, homes and govt buildings in Kurram’s Bagan and Bacha Kot neighbourhoods after Friday prayers. Social media users shared videos and pictures of a burning market with orange flames piercing the night sky. Gunfire can also be heard in the background.Businesses, educational institutions and markets remained closed across Parachinar and surrounding areas for the second consecutive day on Saturday. Describing the situation as extremely tense, officials said mobile phone signals remain suspended across the district. Internet services, however, have been blocked in the region for several months.About 150 people have been killed in recent months due to escalating sectarian violence in the mountainous district, which borders Afghanistan on three sides.Previous clashes in July and Sept, which had killed dozens of people, ended only after a council of elders called for a ceasefire.Meanwhile, thousands of people participated in a sit-in in Parachinar, where protesters criticised govt’s failure to protect civilians. Shop owners in the region had announced a three-day strike on Friday to protest against the attack while locals described an atmosphere of fear across the district.No one has claimed responsibility for the attack, which came a week after authorities had reopened a key highway in the region that had been closed for months following deadly clashes. Speculation also surrounds the involvement of the banned terrorist group Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which has recently been active in the lower part of Kurram. But govt officials attributed the incident to a land dispute.","The sectarian violence follows Thursday’s deadly attack on a convoy of around 200 vehicles in Kurram.

""We will restore the routine life as quickly as possible,"" he said.A grand jirga (traditional council) will be called to discuss problems hampering restoration of peace in the district.Meanwhile, funeral prayers were offered for the individuals who were killed in the incident in Bagan and Ochit, Lower Kurram.Tribal leaders from Turi and Bangash communities, including Jalal Bangash, expressed their deep concerns.They stated that for the past one and a half months, they had been demanding the government to ensure safe travel routes.Two weeks ago, more than 1,00,000 people participated in a peace march to reopen and secure the main highway, after which the government assured them of safe convoys.In September, more than 50 people were killed and 120 others injured in clashes spread over eight days between Shia and Sunni tribes over a piece of land in Kurram district.The intensity of the fighting had led to the closure of the Parachinar-Peshawar main road and the Pak-Afghan Kharlachi border, disrupting transportation and movement.The road blockade has caused a shortage of essential items, including food, fuel, and medicines, worsening the situation for residents.The fighting had spread to areas such as Balishkhel, Sadda, Khar Kallay, Peewar and Maqbal in the district, which borders Afghanistan's Khost, Paktia, Logar and Nangarhar provinces, which are considered strongholds of the ISIS and the Pakistan Taliban.Similar clashes in the same region in July left dozens of people dead and more than 225 injured.","Heavily-armed militants on Thursday ambushed dozens of vehicles carrying passengers in Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief secretary Nadeem Aslam Chaudhry said the death toll could rise as the condition of 11 wounded people was critical.The convoys were carrying members of the Shia community, Kurram’s deputy commissioner Javedullah Mehsud said. Women and children sought refuge in local houses during the assault.The mountainous Kurram district has a long history of sectarian violence between Sunni and Shia groups. In recent years, it has become a hotspot for attacks by the Pakistan Taliban and Islamic State (IS) terrorists, both of which are vehemently anti-Shia.Kurram, a region with a large Taliban presence, has seen repeated clashes between Sunni and Shia tribes this year, often tied to land disputes. Violence in July led to an intertribal ceasefire signed on August 2, but tensions reignited in late Sept when 25 people were killed. More violence followed on Oct 12, when 15 people died in another convoy attack, prompting the closure of Kurram’s main highway.The Thall-Parachinar road had reopened in recent days for limited travel under police protection, but Thursday’s attack demonstrated the fragility of security in the area.Residents reported a tense atmosphere, with daily activities disrupted by road closures and a mobile internet blackout now in its third month.Pakistan home minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the attack on unarmed people, saying: “This past week has been difficult and upsetting.

History of sectarian violence in Kurram district

Heavily-armed militants ambushed ambushed dozens of vehicles carrying passengers in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kurram district on Thursday, killing around 50 people, mostly from the minority Shia community. The attack is one of the worst in recent years in Pakistan's volatile northwest, a region frequently plagued by sectarian violence and militant assaults.The convoy was en route from Parachinar to Peshawar when gunmen opened fire.Javed Ullah Mehsud, the deputy commissioner of Kurram, confirmed that 45 people have died in the attack on the convoy, while rescue teams rushed to assist the wounded.Although no group has officially claimed responsibility for the attack, the region is known to be under the influence of the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which has been linked to similar attacks in the area.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) government spokespersons indicated that the convoy, initially reported to have included 200 vehicles, was traveling through areas dominated by militant groups, raising fears of further escalations in an already tense region.Pakistan’s President Asif Ali Zardari strongly condemned the ambush, calling it a ""cowardly and inhumane act"" and urging that those responsible be brought to justice. He also called for immediate medical aid for the injured.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif echoed Zardari’s sentiments, terming the attack a “brutal” assault on innocent citizens. ""The enemies of the peace of the country attacked the convoy of innocent citizens which is tantamount to brutality. All attempts of anti-national elements to destroy the peace of the beloved country will be thwarted,"" he stated, promising to track down the perpetrators.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur also condemned the attack, directing a delegation of provincial officials to visit Kurram district to assess the situation and report back. He has also ordered the establishment of a Provincial Highways Police unit to secure roads in the region.""Targeting innocent civilians is extremely tragic and condemnable. Those involved in this incident will not escape the grip of the law,"" Gandapur added, offering condolences to the victims' families and announcing financial assistance for them.The area has long been a hotspot for sectarian tensions between Shia and Sunni Muslims, primarily stemming from a longstanding land dispute.This volatile region has witnessed multiple sectarian clashes this year. In October, at least 16 people, including women and children, were killed in similar violence. In September, more than 50 people were killed and 120 injured in clashes between Shia and Sunni tribes over land disputes. This violence led to the closure of critical roads and disrupted essential services in the area. Similar clashes in July resulted in dozens of deaths and hundreds of injuries.Kurram district borders Afghanistan’s Khost, Paktia, Logar, and Nangarhar provinces, known as strongholds for groups like ISIS and the Pakistani Taliban, complicating efforts to curb violence in the area.","Militants ambushed dozens of vehicles carrying passengers in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kurram district on Thursday, killing around 50 people.

Bannu has seen heightened militant violence of late, including the abductions of cops, attack on a prison, attack on a girls’ school, and shootouts that have left several security officials dead.On Monday, over half a dozen policemen were abducted from a checkpost in an adjacent North Waziristan tribal district. They were later recovered by police, with the help of tribal elders.Over the weekend at least eight security personnel were killed and three injured in fierce gun battles with militants in Tirah valley of Khyber tribal district, bordering Afghanistan.On Saturday, at least seven security officials were killed and 18 others wounded in Baluchistan’s Kalat region in a pre-dawn terrorist attack on a checkpost. Earlier this month, at least 26 people, including 16 security personnel, lost their lives and 61 others were injured in a suicide bombing at a railway station in Quetta, Baluchistan’s capital.","At least 12 soldiers and six terrorists were killed in a clash between security forces and militants.
