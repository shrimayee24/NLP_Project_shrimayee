"Our border is with Tibet, not China: Arunachal CM Pema Khandu takes swipe at Beijing",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/our-border-is-with-tibet-not-china-arunachal-cm-pema-khandu-takes-swipe-at-beijing/articleshow/122350454.cms,"Arunachal CM Pema Khandu (File photo)

Arunachal Pradesh shares a 1,200km border with Tibet, not China, chief minister Pema Khandu declared Wednesday in a surgical swipe at Beijing for repeatedly laying claim to the northeastern state, and also creating what he called a ticking ""water bomb"" in the form of the world's largest dam project on the Yarlung Tsangpo (Brahmaputra in India) river.""Officially, yes, Tibet is under China now. That can't be ruled out... but originally we shared a border with Tibet,"" he told PTI in Delhi on his way back from the Dalai Lama's 90th birthday celebration in Dharamshala.""In Arunachal Pradesh, we share three international boundaries - with Bhutan approximately 150km, with Tibet... and on the eastern side, with Myanmar approximately 550km.""Khandu, in his third consecutive term as CM and credited with strengthening BJP's hold on the state, made the remarks while seeking to ""correct"" the interviewer the moment he referred to Arunachal Pradesh bordering China.Pointing to China's ""forcible"" occupation of Tibet in 1950, Khandu said that if one looked at India's map, ""none of the Indian states directly shares borders with China"".The CM's statement comes amid China's intensified bid to stamp its authority on the Dalai Lama's succession. Union minister and fellow Arunachal Pradesh native Kiren Rijiju, said recently that the decision on who should be the Dalai Lama's successor should be solely his and in accordance with established Tibetan Buddhist convention.No government, including China's communist regime, should have a say, he said.On the dam China is building on the Yarlung Tsangpo, the Tibetan name for the Brahmaputra, Khandu warned that the project poses an “existential threat” to Arunachal and its neighbouring northeastern states. He termed it “a bigger issue” than anything else other than the Chinese “military threat” hanging over the region.Khandu said Beijing not being a signatory to any international water treaty meant it “cannot be trusted”. “No one knows what they might do... Suppose the dam is built and they suddenly release water, our entire Siang belt would be destroyed. The Adi tribe and similar groups would suffer devastating effects,” he said. The CM said that after discussions with the Union government, Arunachal Pradesh conceived the Siang Upper Multipurpose Project as a bulwark against China's intentions. “Since we cannot make China see reason, it is better that we focus on our own defence mechanisms and preparations,” he told PTI.","Arunachal Pradesh shares a 1,200km border with Tibet, not China, chief minister says.

Arvind Kejriwal says he deserves a Nobel prize; BJP calls claim 'laughable'; AAP fires back,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/arvind-kejriwal-says-he-deserves-a-nobel-prize-bjp-calls-claim-laughable-aap-fires-back/articleshow/122348708.cms,"NEW DELHI: Delhi BJP chief Virendra Sachdeva on Wednesday ridiculed AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal’s recent comment that he deserves a Nobel Prize for governance, calling the remark “laughable” and claiming the former chief minister would be better suited for awards in “corruption” and ""incompetence,"" news agency PTI reported.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) hit back swiftly, urging the BJP to concentrate on delivery and administration in the national capital rather than indulging in ""name-calling.""""Virendra Sachdeva is in government now. It’s time to govern, not just talk. Opposition days are over — now you have to deliver. Delhi is waiting for real work, not distractions or name-calling,"" said Delhi AAP president Saurabh Bharadwaj in a statement.Kejriwal’s comments, made during the release of the Punjabi edition of the book Kejriwal Model in Chandigarh on Tuesday, praised the performance of his government in Delhi despite hurdles.“Despite being stopped from working, we delivered. I should get a Nobel Prize for governance and administration for doing so much despite a lieutenant governor and various difficulties,” he said.Reacting sharply, Sachdeva accused Kejriwal of presiding over a regime tainted with scams.“Kejriwal demanding a Nobel Prize is laughable. The people of Delhi are stunned. If there were Nobel Prizes for incompetence, anarchy, and corruption, he would have surely received one,” Sachdeva said.He cited alleged scams during Kejriwal’s tenure — including the controversial renovation of his official residence, dubbed the “Sheesh Mahal” by BJP, and other issues such as the classroom construction project, liquor policy, and pension schemes.Kejriwal, who served as Delhi chief minister from 2015 until September 2024, had defended his governance model at the Chandigarh event, claiming that it was rooted in honesty.“If a government is corrupt, if its ministers are looting, this model will collapse,” he said, adding that the AAP model had also shown results in Punjab.“Previous governments claimed the treasury was empty. But we fixed schools and hospitals, gave free electricity — because we curbed corruption and saved public money,” he added.Taking aim at the current BJP administration in Delhi, Kejriwal alleged that services had “collapsed” since the AAP exited office.Sachdeva countered that Delhi’s residents had not forgotten the “scams” that took place under AAP’s watch — citing issues like panic buttons in buses and mismanagement of welfare schemes for women.",Virendra Sachdeva calls Arvind Kejriwal's comment that he deserves a Nobel Prize 'laughable' Delhi BJP chief says former chief minister would be better suited for awards in 'corruption' and 'incompetence' Kejriwal's comments were made during the release of the Punjabi edition of the Kejriwal Model in Chandigarh.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122348690,imgsize-797378,width-400,resizemode-4/122348690.jpg"
Goods train halts for 2 hours in Jharkhand as elephant gives birth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/goods-train-halts-for-2-hours-in-jharkhand-as-elephant-gives-birth/articleshow/122328782.cms,"RAMGARH: A goods train carrying coal was stopped for over two hours so that a pregnant elephant, who was in labour on the track, could give birth to a calf undisturbed.The incident took place on a forest stretch between Barkakana and Hazaribag railway stations in Jharkhand. Since the particular track is primarily used for goods transportation, no passenger train was affected.Two weeks ago, around 3am, the forest officials contacted railway officials to halt the goods trains for a few hours. The loco pilot was immediately alerted to ensure that both the jumbo and the calf were safe.Divisional forest officer, Ramgarh, Nitish Kumar, said: ""A forest guard informed me that a pregnant elephant is lying on the tracks in labour pain. He warned that it might get run over, and requested to stop all train movement along the route. I immediately contacted railway control room in Barkakana and requested them to stop all trains.""Videos of the incident, recorded by a forest guard and some locals, was widely circulated on social media Tuesday.The heart-warming incident marks a sharp contrast to rising incidents of human-elephant conflict in the state.

Delhi HC directs Udaipur Files screening for petitioners,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-hc-directs-udaipur-files-screening-for-petitioners/articleshow/122350813.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Wednesday directed the producer of 'Udaipur Files', a movie based on tailor Kanhaiya Lal murder case, to arrange a screening of the film for those opposed to its release.The HC's direction came after the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) and the makers of the movie claimed that ""objectionable"" portions had been removed from the film, and there was no ground to stall its release.The petitions claimed that the movie had the potential to inflame communal tensions and disrupt public order in the country.A division bench of Chief Justice D K Upadhyaya and Justice Anish Dayal directed the producers to arrange the screening on Wednesday itself for senior advocate Kapil Sibal, representing the petitioners, including Maulana Arshad Madani, Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind president and principal of Darul Uloom, Deoband. The bench asked the petitioners to view the censored version and come back to the court on Thursday.Earlier, Sibal argued that while free speech is protected, ""the film's intent appears to fuel communal disharmony"". ASG Chetan Sharma, appearing for I&B ministry and CBFC, responded that the censor board had already removed the flagged content. Sibal, however, maintained that the movie's ""overall tone remains problematic"", and the entire purpose appeared to be to target an entire community.The petitioners said while Lal was murdered by two fanatics, the movie's trailer, released on June 26, ""falsely"" showed the crime being carried out with the complicity of religious heads/leaders of the community.The producer informed the court that the trailer had been removed, but Sibal responded that the damage was already done.The petitioners also claimed that the film violated constitutional morality by weaponising the freedom of expression to weaken the constitutional vision of a plural, inclusive and secular India, and instead attempted to mainstream narratives that would deepen social and religious divisions.Lal was beheaded in his shop in June 2022 by Mohammad Riyaz and Mohammad Ghous -- who recorded the act and circulated the clip - allegedly for his post supporting former BJP leader Nupur Sharma over her controversial remarks on Prophet Mohammed.","'Udaipur Files' is a movie based on tailor Kanhaiya Lal murder case.

ED searches farm neta among 'donkey route' agents in illegal immigration case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ed-searches-farm-neta-among-donkey-route-agents-in-illegal-immigration-case/articleshow/122349977.cms,"ED

BATHINDA/NEW DELHI: In a massive crackdown on illegal immigration rackets operating from several cities in Punjab and Haryana, the Enforcement Director on Wednesday conducted searches at 11 locations in seven cities on some of these agents, including on the premises of farmers' union leader Sukhwinder Singh , also known as Sukh Gill, the president of BKU (Totewal) faction, for their involvement in sending unsuspecting people through the 'donkey route' to the US.ED officials spent several hours inside Gill's house at Tota Singh Wala village in Moga district, around 80 km from Ludhiana, and went through various documents, sources said.Gill, who was not at home when the ED team arrived, said he had nothing to hide and that some people were conspiring against him. He said the human trafficking complaint against him was false and he was open to being investigated by any agency.ED searches were carried out in Amritsar, Sangrur, Patiala, Moga, Ambala, Kurukshetra and Karnal on agents who were found charging Rs 40-50 lakh each from victims, promising to send them to the US through legal channels. At least 400 such people were deported, handcuffed and chained, by the US in military aircraft since Feb.Soon after their arrival in India, the ED began its probe and recorded statements of the victims of 'immigration fraud'. Questioning revealed the names of agents who were behind this racket, a senior official said. The ED's money laundering investigation is based on 17 FIRs registered by police in Punjab and Haryana against some of these travel agents and middlemen offering to arrange 'visas' by the American embassy.""During investigation, it was gathered that the agents used to target people who wanted to immigrate to the US. Promising them migration through legal channels and through flights, the agents charged them huge amounts (around Rs 45-50 lakh per candidate),"" a source said.However, the agents later forced them to take the donkey route (illegal channel) by crossing the land borders of many countries, sometimes illegally through dangerous forests ""under the influence of mafias"".These agents, in collusion with mafias at border crossings, created threatening situations for illegal migrants and their families during their journey, and were forced to pay more money, besides the Rs 40-50 lakh charged at the beginning. The revelations were made by some of the deportees when they were interrogated by the ED.","Sukh Gill, president of BKU (Totewal) faction, said he had nothing to hide.

JAMMU: A Pahalgam-bound vehicle part of the Amarnath Yatra convoy hit a divider in Udhampur’s Chenani area early Wednesday, leaving the driver injured, even as four passengers escaped unscathed.Preliminary probe suggested the driver may have dozed off at the wheel, leading to the accident around 6.17am. “The injured driver, Shashikant, is a resident of Haryana’s Karnal. He was admitted to Udhampur GMCH with a head injury,” said an official.Meanwhile, the eighth batch of Amarnath yatris — comprising 7,579 pilgrims — set out early Wednesday from Jammu’s Bhagwati Nagar base camp for the holy cave shrine nestled in the Himalayas. Of them, 3,031 pilgrims chose to travel via the Baltal route, while 4548 devotees opted for the traditional Pahalgam route, officials said.Last week, 36 were injured when four buses ferrying Amarnath pilgrims had a chain collision in Ramban’s Chanderkote on the Jammu-Srinagar NH on July 5. On July 3, two yatris were injured inside Tunnel no. 3 of the NH’s Khooni Nala section when their car hit a minibus.This year’s annual Amarnath Yatra commenced on July 3 and will conclude on Aug 9 (Shravan Purnima/Raksha Bandhan).","A Pahalgam-bound vehicle part of the Amarnath Yatra convoy hit a divider in Udhampur’s Chenani area early Wednesday.

.





US President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday (local time) that Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy will now serve as the interim administrator of Nasa In a post on Truth Social, Trump praised Duffy’s work in transportation, saying he is improving air traffic control systems and rebuilding roads and bridges.“Sean is doing a TREMENDOUS job in handling our Country’s Transportation Affairs, including creating state-of-the-art Air Traffic Control systems, while at the same time rebuilding our roads and bridges, making them efficient and beautiful again. He will be a fantastic leader of the ever more important Space Agency, even if only for a short period of time. Congratulations, and thank you, Sean,” the president wrote in a Truth Social post.Soon after, Duffy responded by thanking President Trump and accepting the role.“Honored to accept this mission. Time to take over space. Let’s launch,” Duffy wrote on X.This change comes after Trump withdrew his earlier choice, tech billionaire Jared Isaacman, at the end of May. Isaacman had been set for a Senate vote to confirm him as Nasa chief, but Trump canceled the nomination, citing a “thorough review of prior associations.”Isaacman is known for his private space missions and is close friends with SpaceX CEO and billionaire Elon Musk . Trump said it would be “inappropriate” for someone so close to Musk to lead Nasa, given how much Nasa works with SpaceX.“After a thorough review of prior associations, I am hereby withdrawing the nomination of Jared Isaacman to head Nasa. I will soon announce a new Nominee who will be Mission aligned, and put America First in Space,” the president said at the time.Musk, who was once a close Trump ally and had led the Department of Government Efficiency, has recently fallen out with Trump over disagreements about the president’s broader policy agenda.Musk and Duffy reportedly clashed at a March cabinet meeting, when the Transportation Secretary accused the tech billionaire of trying to fire air traffic controllers, CNN quoted.Duffy is not the only member of the president’s Cabinet taking on additional roles outside of their traditional duties. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is currently also serving as interim national security adviser and national archivist.","US President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy will now serve as the interim administrator of Nasa.

'Nefarious mechanism': Republicans issue stern warning to US universities against Chinese scholarship program; call it security threat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nefarious-mechanism-republicans-issue-stern-warning-to-us-universities-against-chinese-scholarship-program-call-it-security-threat/articleshow/122354192.cms,"AP image





House Republicans have asked seven US universities to cut ties with a Chinese scholarship program that lawmakers cite as “nefarious mechanism” which aims to steal technology for the Chinese government.The lawmakers sent letters on Tuesday to Dartmouth College, the University of Notre Dame and five other schools, warning them about their partnerships with the China Scholarship Council (CSC). The CSC is a study-abroad program funded by the Chinese government that pays for hundreds of Chinese graduate students to study at US universities every year. After graduation, these students are required to return to China for two years.Republican Representative John Moolenaar, chair of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, called the program a threat to US national security. He wrote that the CSC claims to be an academic partnership but it actually uses American universities to support China’s military and scientific growth.Some universities say they are already leaving the program. Dartmouth said it has had fewer than 10 students in the program over the past 10 years and had already decided to end it.Notre Dame said it began ending its involvement earlier this year. The University of Tennessee confirmed it received the letter and is reviewing it.The House committee is now reviewing how the program operates at US universities. Lawmakers have demanded for documents related to the program from all seven institutions.According to the letters, these partnerships have brought up to 15 Chinese graduate students a year to Dartmouth and about 40 to Notre Dame.House Republicans, including US President Donald Trump , have been paying closer attention to Chinese students in the US. In May, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the US would cancel visas for some Chinese students studying in critical field. During his first term, Trump restricted visas for students linked to China’s “military-civil fusion” strategy.Many US universities agree on the need to protect research but warn against treating all Chinese scholars with suspicion. They note that only a small number have ever been involved in spying.China is the second-largest source of foreign students in the US, after India. In the 2023–24 academic year, more than 270,000 Chinese students studied in the US, making up about a quarter of all international students. Most pay their own way, and many stay to work in the US, while others return to China after graduation.Representative Moolenaar has focused on cutting ties between US and Chinese universities. In May, he pressured Duke University to end a partnership he said allowed access to federally funded research. In June, Eastern Michigan University ended ties with two Chinese universities after pressure from the committee.Last year, House Republicans released a report claiming that hundreds of millions of dollars in US government research funding had ended up helping China advance in artificial intelligence, semiconductors, and nuclear weapons. The report called China’s academic partnerships “Trojan horses” for stealing technology and said China was taking advantage of academic cooperation in a secretive and harmful way.","House Republicans have asked seven US universities to cut ties with a Chinese scholarship program.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday announced new sanctions against a senior UN Human Rights Council official who criticized Israel’s military actions in Gaza. Rubio accused the official of leading a “campaign of political and economic warfare” against both the United States and Israel, as reported by Politico.Francesca Albanese, UN Human Rights Council Special Rapporteur, had called for the International Criminal Court (ICC) “to investigate and prosecute corporate executives and/or corporate entities,”. Albanese alleged that war crimes had been committed by Israel during its war with Hamas.“The United States will continue to take whatever actions we deem necessary to respond to lawfare and protect our sovereignty and that of our allies,” Rubio had responded in a statement. He said Albanese’s efforts to push for criminal prosecutions by the ICC and other bodies are “illegitimate and shameful.”Earlier this month, the US had called for the United Nations to remove Albanese on the grounds of “virulent antisemitism and support for terrorism"".“An unacceptable campaign of political and economic warfare against the American and worldwide economy.” wrote Dorothy Shea, the active US representative to the UN, in the letter.In the report titled “From Economy of Occupation to Economy of Genocide,” Albanese named 48 corporate companies, ranging from arms manufacturers to financial firms, accused of profiting through their cooperation with the Israeli government.“Israel’s settler-colonial occupation has transformed into an insidious, bureaucratic and militarized regime of destruction — a calculated economy of genocide,” she wrote.Albanese, an Italian scholar, was appointed in 2022 and has urged for arms embargo and sanctions against Israel since its full-scale invasion of Gaza in October 2023. She had publicly remarked that “the victims of the October 7 massacre were not murdered because of their Jewishness, but in response to Israeli oppression,” following which she was banned from Israel in February 2024.She had previously stated that Israel’s offensive in Gaza is “part of a long-term international, systematic state-organized forced displacement and replacement of Palestinians.”","Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced new sanctions against a senior UN Human Rights Council official who criticized Israel's military actions in Gaza.

Donald Trump targets Brazil: US President announces 50% tariffs; cites 'witch hunt' against Bolsonaro,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trump-targets-brazil-us-president-announces-50-tariffs-cites-witch-hunt-against-bolsonaro/articleshow/122352165.cms,"Trump's tariffs salvo

US President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday his intention to implement a 50% tariff on Brazilian imports, partially responding to what he terms a ""witch hunt"" against his political ally, former Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro , who faces coup-related charges.Trump's letter addressed to President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva stated the tariffs would commence August 1. ""The way that Brazil has treated former President Bolsonaro, a Highly Respected Leader throughout the World during his Term, including by the United States, is an international disgrace.""The letter further indicated the 50% tariff was essential to ""have the Level Playing Field we must have with your Country"" and ""to rectify the grave injustices of the current regime.""The letter also cited ""SECRET and UNLAWFUL Censorship Orders to UA Social Media platforms"" and announced a trade investigation into Brazil regarding ""continued attacks on the Digital Trade activities of American Companies.""Lula hit back at Trump, soon after the announcement, hinting at reciprocal tariffs. ""Any unilateral tariff increases will be addressed in light of the Brazilian Law of Economic Reciprocity,"" Lula wrote on X.He further criticised Trump over him citing the Bolsonaro trial. ""Brazil is a sovereign nation with independent institutions that will not accept being dictated to by anyone.The judicial process against those who planned the coup d'état is solely within the jurisdiction of the Brazilian Judiciary and, therefore, is not subject to any form of interference or threat that undermines the independence of national institutions,"" said the Brazil President.""In the context of digital platforms, Brazilian society rejects content promoting hatred, racism, child pornography, scams, fraud, and rhetoric against human rights and democratic freedom.In Brazil, freedom of expression is not to be confused with aggression or violent practices. To operate in our country, all national and foreign companies are subject to Brazilian legislation,"" he added.Lula further claimed that Trump's claim of deficit is incorrect, saying, ""The claim regarding an alleged US trade deficit in the commercial relationship between Brazil and the United States is false. Statistics from the U.S. government itself confirm a surplus for that country in the trade of goods and services with Brazil, amounting to 410 billion dollars over the past 15 years.""Additionally, talking about Brazil's sovereignty, Lula also said, ""Sovereignty, respect, and the unwavering defence of the interests of the Brazilian people are the values that guide our relationship with the world.""Meanwhile, Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who oversees the Bolsonaro case, has directed tech companies to remove numerous accounts allegedly threatening Brazilian democracy, making him a significant target for right-wing critics in both countries.Trump publicly opposed the criminal proceedings against Bolsonaro on Monday as well, concerning the former president's attempts to retain power following his defeat in Brazil's 2022 election. Lula responded decisively, telling reporters on Monday, ""I think it's very wrong and very irresponsible for a president to be threatening others on social media. People have to learn that respect is a good thing."" He further remarked about Trump, ""He needs to know that the world has changed. We don't want an emperor.""US President Donald Trump has announced a fresh round of steep import tariffs on several countries, apart from a 50 per cent duty on Brazil. Other affected nations include the Philippines, Brunei, Moldova, Algeria, Libya, Iraq, and Sri Lanka, with tariffs ranging from 20 to 30 per cent. These will take effect from August 1, 2025.This move followed Monday’s release of tariff letters to 14 countries, including Japan, South Korea, and South Africa, with duties between 25 and 40 per cent. Trump’s total list now spans over 20 countries, targeting what he calls “non-reciprocal” trade practices.The rollout marks a shift from Trump’s earlier “Liberation Day” announcements via visual boards to formal, if unusually styled, letters. He called the written approach “more powerful” and effective.While the Trump administration positions the sweeping duties as a correction to unfair trade imbalances, analysts warn of risks to global supply chains and heightened diplomatic tensions.Read more: Donald Trump fires new tariff salvo!

BENGALURU: A 26-year-old man, who graduated in hotel management, was arrested by the Banashankari police in connection with allegations of filming and posting voyeuristic videos of women walking on the streets of Bengaluru.The accused has been identified as Gurdeep Singh, a resident of KR Puram. He is currently unemployed and staying with his brother in a rented house.The Banashankari police took up the suo-motu case against the account handler on June 12 and arrested him yesterday (Wednesday) from his house. A senior police officer said the social media wing noticed an Instagram account handler was filming and posting videos of women.The videos appeared to be voyeuristic in nature. So, based on the complaint filed by Police Sub-Inspector of Banashankari police station, Praveen Hosur, a suo-motu case was registered in the same station under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) section 78 (stalking) and under the Information Technology Act.The police were tracking the videos posted by Gurdeep, and a technical team was working on tracking his IP address and his details.Meanwhile, a graduate student at a private college raised an objection on her Instagram account, stating, ""Recently, there was a video of me shot in public on Church Street. It was shot very inappropriately and then posted online without my consent. I tried contacting the person behind the account, and there was no response.""""I tried reporting from multiple accounts. But apparently, it says that it follows community guidelines. I don’t even know the community guidelines for Instagram at this point. The reels have been viewed by the minute, and people are finding my account. I have been getting vulgar messages, to say the least,"" she stated in the video on her Instagram account.""There are a lot of women like me who have been posted from that account, and the account has 10,000 followers. To see that this is becoming normal on social media, we need to speak up. We need to do the right things because while we are out there fighting for languages, I think there are more serious concerns to be addressed. I am tagging Bengaluru City police and cyber crime to help me take that account down, and I really hope you guys do as well because numbers speak,"" she added. Police took a note of the plight by the student and tracked him down.PSI Hosur, in his complaint, stated that as per the orders of the higher authorities, they were keeping watch on those people who are creating derogatory videos about political parties, castes, and religions and uploading them on social media, thereby endangering law and order. On the evening of June 12, they found the Instagram of Gurdeep (the account handle is not mentioned as the police don’t want more people to view the videos or probably download them and post them on other social media platforms). A senior officer told TOI, ""We are working on getting an order from the court to get the handle deleted or deactivated by Instagram.""At the time of registering the case, Gurdeep uploaded around 45 videos. The police noticed that the reels uploaded by him, capturing women obscenely, were shown in slow motion to get more views. Further investigation is in progress.","A 26-year-old man was arrested by the Banashankari police in connection with allegations of filming and posting voyeuristic videos of women.

Taliban Reject International Criminal Court's Pressure On Women's Rights Issues In Afghanistan





The International Criminal Court on Tuesday (local time) issued arrest warrants against two top Taliban leaders, accusing them of persecuting girls and women in Afghanistan, CNN reported.In a statement, ICC clarified that the two men, Taliban supreme leader Haibatullah Akhundzada and chief justice Abdul Hakim Haqqani are accused of encouraging the abuse of women, girls and others who don’t adhere with the Taliban’s policy on gender.In response, the Taliban called the arrest warrants “nonsense” and said they don’t recognize the ICC. They also accused the court of showing hatred toward Islam by calling their interpretation of Islamic law a crime.Back in January, the ICC’s chief prosecutor said the duo has been criminally responsible for carrying out gender-based persecution since at least August 15, 2021, when the Taliban took over Afghanistan.Since returning to power in 2021, the Taliban have imposed harsh restrictions on women and girls. Girls are banned from attending school beyond sixth grade. Women must cover their entire bodies and faces in public and are not allowed to speak to or look at men outside their families.The sound of women’s voices in public has also been restricted.The ICC said the Taliban have especially targeted women and girls because of their gender, taking away their basic rights and freedom.“While the Taliban have imposed certain rules and prohibitions on the population as a whole, they have specifically targeted girls and women by reason of their gender, depriving them of fundamental rights and freedoms,” the ICC said on Tuesday.“Specifically, the Taliban severely deprived, through decrees and edicts, girls and women of the rights to education, privacy and family life and the freedoms of movement, expression, thought, conscience and religion,” it continued.The regime has also targeted people who support women’s rights and LGBTQ people whose identities don’t fit the Taliban’s rules on gender.The arrest warrants were issued one day after the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution expressing deep concern about the worsening oppression of women and girls in Afghanistan. The UN called on the Taliban to quickly reverse these policies.Lisa Davis, ICC’s Special Adviser on Gender and Other Discriminatory Crimes, said this is the first time an international court has recognized LGBTQ people as victims of crimes against humanity for gender persecution, according to media reports.Human rights groups have welcomed the ICC move. Amnesty International’s Secretary General Agnes Callamard called it an important step toward holding those responsible accountable.Liz Evenson, the international justice director of Human Rights Watch said the arrest warrants could provide victims and their families with an essential pathway to justice.",International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants against two top Taliban leaders.

What Trump said on no ' Epstein client list '







Right-wing commentator Meghyn Kelly has been the latest to turn on Attorney General Pam Bondi after the US administration closed the Epstein case forever, announcing that the convicted sex offender indeed died by suicide in his prison cell, and he did not have a list of clients. The joint memo of the DOJ and the FBI led to a major meltdown of the MAGA activists, as releasing Epstein files was one of the promises that the Donald Trump administration promised with certainty.Megyn Kelly said onher show that Pam Bondi's days are numbered as a member of the Trump administration. “Pam Bondi knew she was about to embarrass some of his most loyal surrogates out there, and did that willingly, or she didn’t take the time to make sure what was in those binders,” Kelly said. “It was all publicly released information that had already been out there…She was too lazy to actually figure out none of this is new, and yet she called a meeting with the influencers that included Kash Patel, the head of the FBI, and the sitting vice president. ”“Then she acted indignant. She didn’t know. It was the sleazy FBI who had withheld the real documents from her,” Kelly said. “She was going to get to the bottom of it.Then she said further release would come. One did not come. Then she was caught on tape saying there are tens of thousands of kiddie porn or child pornography material that we found, which again, is like, a third issue over here. And next thing we know there’s no there there. ”“They f***ed up because they trusted her,” Kelly said. “They were humiliated because she gave them all these binders that read ‘Epstein Files,’ you know, ‘Volume 1,’ and there was nothing new in there. Nothing. There was no scoop. Why would she do that?”Bondi claimed she never said there was a client list waiting on her desk during a February Fox News interview, and what she was referring to was the overall Epstein file. She also claimed the files not released were child porn which would not be made public after she previously teased “truckloads” of evidence.When Trump was asked about his administration failing to keep its promise of releasing Epstein list, and instead coming up with the defense that there is no list, Trump expressed wonder that people are still talking about Epstein. ""Are you still talking about Jeffrey Epstein?"" Trump said. ""This guy, we have been talking about for years. You are asking... We have Texas and other issues, and people are still talking about this creep guy that is unbelievable. You are a waste of time. I mean, I can't believe you are asking a question about him and at a time like this, when we are having some of the greatest success and tragedy with what happened in Texas. It seems like a disaggregation.""","Megyn Kelly said onher show that Pam Bondi's days are numbered as a member of the Trump administration.

Vice President JD Vance recently tore into New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani and asked who he thinks he is, having no shred of gratitude to the country. The case in point was Mamdani's July 4 social media post in which he wrote: ""America is beautiful, contradictory, unfinished. I am proud of our country even as we constantly strive to make it better, to protect and deepen our democracy, to fulfill its promise for each and every person who calls it home. Happy Independence Day. No Kings in America.""JD Vance said Mamdani, according to many reports, never publicly mentioned America's Independence Day but when he did this year, there was no gratitude. ""Now, the person who wishes to lead our largest city had, according to multiple media reports, never once publicly mentioned America's Independence Day in earnest. But when he did so this year, this is what he said, and this is an actual quote.""""There was no sense of owing something to this land and the people who turned its wilderness into the most powerful nation on earth,"" JD Vance said as he addressed Conservative think tank Claremont Institute’s Statesmanship Award Dinner in San Diego.""I wonder, has he ever read the letters from boy soldiers in the Union Army to parents and sweethearts that they'd never see again?"" Vance continued. ""Has he ever visited the grave site of a loved one who gave their life to build the kind of society where his family could escape racial theft and racial violence?

Former White House doctor, Kevin O'Connor has refused to answer questions on the declining cognitive health of former US president Joe Biden on Wednesday, exercising his constitutional right under the Fifth Amendment for self-incrimination.Dr O’Connor swiftly left the House office building after what was intended to be a transcribed interview with the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee behind closed doors, as per the Washington Times.“‘Were you ever told to lie about the president’s health?’ He pleaded the Fifth Amendment,” said Oversight chairman James Comer while referring to the two questions that were asked to O’Connor. “‘Did you ever believe President Biden was unfit to execute his duties?’ Again, President Biden’s White House physician pleaded the Fifth Amendment.” the chairman added, as reported by the New York Post.The only question to which O’Connor provided an answer to was a confirmation of his name, as per an Oversight spokesperson, before he quickly left the House office building.David Schertler, one of O’Connor’s attorneys, said the doctor was left with “no choice” but to invoke his Fifth Amendment rights during his testimony before the committee, as reported by AP.“This is unprecedented, and I think that this adds more fuel to the fire that there was a cover-up,” commented Comer. “Clearly there was a conspiracy to cover up,” said Comer in a subsequent statement. “We will continue to interview more Biden White House aides to get the answers Americans deserve,” he added.“There’s more and more evidence that comes out every day that would suggest that the president was in a pretty severe mental decline, so we’re going to ask about that,” Comer said.“We can’t have the physician’s office not being truthful about the health condition of the president,” he said adding that the interview is part of a broader investigation into who in the Biden White House was authorized to use the autopen for signing executive actions and pardons.Biden has strongly rejected the claims questioning his mental fitness during his tenure calling them ""ridiculous and false,"", as per AP.Comer also referred to the book “Original Sin” published by journalists Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, in May 20, and asserted that O’Connor decision to invoke the Fifth Amendment further solidifies claims made in that book.The authors alleged that there exists a “Politburo” of close senior advisers, including Annie Tomasini, who served as the “ultimate decision makers” in the previous administration.Other alleged “Politburo” members who are scheduled for interviews with the Oversight panel include Ron Klain, the former White House chief of staff on July 24, Steve Ricchetti, former counselor to the president on July 30, Mike Donilon, former senior adviser on July 31 and Bruce Reed the former deputy chief of staff for police on August 5.Anita Dunn, who had stepped down as senior adviser in Biden White House in August 2024, is scheduled for a transcribed interview on August 7.The panel has started scheduling interviews with former Biden allies to assess whether they were administering the role of the presidency instead of former US president Joe Biden due to his alleged cognitive decline, as reported by the Washington Times.The next interview is scheduled for Friday with Ashley Williams, the former Special Assistant to the President and Deputy Director of Oval Office Operations.","Former White House doctor, Kevin O'Connor has refused to answer questions on the declining cognitive health of former US president Joe Biden.

Emergency planning questioned

Trump administration backs

FEMA response





The devastating floods sweeping through central Texas have claimed at least 119 lives, with over 160 people still unaccounted for, reports CNN.The catastrophe has triggered fresh scrutiny of the country’s emergency response model, especially as US President Donald Trump, who recently proposed phasing out the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), is now touting a swift federal response to the crisis.Concerns are also mounting over whether proper precautions were taken in the days before the floods. Records obtained by CNN show that a state inspector had cleared Camp Mystic, where 27 people died, as having an emergency plan just two days before the disaster. The revelation has sparked new questions about how effectively that plan was followed.Governor Abbott, who toured the affected areas recently, said the state’s emergency alert system would be reviewed in a special legislative session this month.Despite Trump’s previous statements about wanting to ""wean off of FEMA"" and shift responsibility to states, his administration is now highlighting how quickly FEMA has responded to the Texas disaster. The president approved Governor Greg Abbott’s request for a major disaster declaration within a day, unlocking federal assistance for affected residents and local authorities.In a Cabinet meeting, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told Trump, “We’re cutting through the paperwork of the old FEMA, streamlining it, much like your vision of how FEMA should operate.”She added that the federal support to Texas resembled the ""state block grants"" model championed by the president.However, former FEMA officials argued the agency’s current involvement reflects its traditional role rather than any substantial shift. “This is a defining event that can help them realise that a Federal Emergency Management Agency is essential,” said Michael Coen, former FEMA chief of staff under Presidents Obama and Biden. “Imagine if an event like this happened a year from now, after FEMA is eliminated.”","Floods sweeping through central Texas have claimed at least 119 lives, with over 160 people still unaccounted for.

India's Big Win In Pak Clash? Jaish Chief Masood Azhar's Brother Rauf 'Eliminated' In Op Sindoor





Pakistan’s former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar faced an uncomfortable moment during a recent Al Jazeera interview as she attempted to defend a man, seen leading funeral prayers for terrorists killed in India's counterterror Operation Sindoor.The individual, widely identified as senior Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) leader Hafiz Abdul Rauf, a UN-designated terrorist, was seen leading funeral prayers for terrorists killed in the Operation Sindoor strikes, where the bodies were accorded full state honours in Pakistan, with uniformed police and army personnel in attendance.Khar claimed the man in question was not the LeT figure India accuses him of being. ""I am telling you with authority, with evidence which has been shared with the whole world, that this is not the man that you (India) are claiming it to be. There are a million Abdul Raufs in Pakistan,"" she said, dismissing India's assertion.However, her defence began to falter when the interviewer pointed out that the man's national ID number matches one listed on the US Treasury Department's sanctions database.The journalist mentioned that the national identity number belonging to Hafiz Abdul Rauf -- 35202-5400413-9 -- was identical to the one listed by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the US Treasury’s list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGT).""They said that he is a member of a political party, and they released his national ID number. That ID number is the same one as on the US sanctions list. So, according to the US sanctions terrorist list, this man is a terrorist,"" the journalist said.Pressed further, Khar responded, ""The Pakistani army is defending this man. The Pakistani army is not defending the person who is proscribed by the US.""She continued, ""The ISPR (Inter-Services Public Relations of Pakistan Army) categorically has said that this is not the same person, and you just sat over here and told me that they just defended him and did not say it is not the same person.""The man at the centre of the controversy, Hafiz Abdul Rauf, is known to be a close associate of 26/11 mastermind Hafiz Saeed and holds senior status in the LeT. The presence of his identity number in the official document shown by Pakistan’s military spokesperson, DG ISPR Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif, matched that of the terrorist sanctioned by the United States.Under Operation Sindoor, India carried out precision strikes on nine terrorist hubs in Pakistan and PoK, including a major Lashkar-e-Taiba base in Muridke, which was reduced to rubble.In an unexpected revelation, the same US list also names Lt Gen Sharif’s father, Mahmood Sultan Bashiruddin, as a designated terrorist with links to al-Qaida -- further raising questions about the Pakistani military’s role in shielding extremists.","Pakistan’s former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar faced an uncomfortable moment during a recent Al Jazeera interview.

Gulzar Dost, a well-known social activist and convener of Kech Civil Society, was arrested on Monday in a wider effort by the Pakistani state to silence dissent in Balochistan.According to The Balochistan Post, Dost was taken from his home in Turbat during a raid by the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) and later charged with what The Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) says were “false and politically motivated” allegations. It has demanded his immediate release.Dost was arrested early Monday morning during a CTD raid at his residence in Turbat. He was then brought before a court and charged, though the exact nature of the charges has not been publicly detailed.In a post on X, BYC described Dost as a peaceful citizen who has always spoken up for families of forcibly disappeared persons and victims of extrajudicial killings.“His only ‘crime’ is standing with the oppressed,” BYC said. “The state cannot tolerate that.”The committee also criticised the CTD, calling it a tool of state repression used to target grassroots activists. It accused authorities of carrying out unlawful raids, filing fake cases, and using forced disappearances to suppress political voices.BYC has demanded Dost’s unconditional release and warned that the continued targeting of activists will only increase resistance in the region.“If the state thinks it can create silence in Balochistan by targeting political activists, it is gravely mistaken,” the group said.The arrest is part of what rights groups say is an increasing pattern of intimidation against Baloch activists. Just two days ago, at least five men were reportedly forcibly disappeared by Pakistani security forces during a series of raids in the Kech and Gwadar districts of Balochistan.A wave of anger has swept across Pakistan’s troubled Balochistan province after the reported abduction and killing of young Baloch activist Zeeshan Ahmed by military personnel. Zeeshan had been actively campaigning for the safe return of his father, Zaheer Ahmed, who was forcibly disappeared by the Frontier Corps back in 2015.","Gulzar Dost, a well-known social activist and convener of Kech Civil Society, was arrested on Monday.

ISLAMABAD: Swat Valley and Gilgit-Baltistan — key cradles of the Indus river — are battling deadly floods triggered by relentless monsoon rains and glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), exposing Pakistan’s weak climate governance and the fragility of its disaster response.At least 72 people have died nationwide, including 14 in Swat and 23 in Astore (Gilgit-Baltistan) where a passenger bus plunged into a swollen river. Another 25 people were rescued from the surging Indus near Shadi Khan in Punjab’s Attock district.Swat’s flash floods were triggered by a GLOF in Kalam Mitaltan area, while accelerated glacier melt in Gilgit-Baltistan has swelled rivers such as the Hunza, Kunjrab, and Shimshal Braldu. In both regions, roads, bridges, and homes have been swept away, leaving mountain communities stranded.“No early warning systems, no modern rescue equipment – Swat is left to drown, again,” said Ambreen Ali, a local activist, echoing growing public frustration.Once a prized alpine tourist destination, Swat continues to reel from its past under Taliban rule (2007–2009). Despite a military-led recovery and donor-funded rebuilding, this summer’s floods have damaged rebuilt infrastructure, including hotels in Kalam and Bahrain and the Mankial bridge, a lifeline for remote villages.In Gilgit-Baltistan, floodwaters threaten power lines and roads in Diamer, Skardu, and Astore, while downstream provinces fear the Indus’s surging flow. In Sindh, farmers worry that floods – exacerbated by dam releases upstream – will drown their fields.The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) blames a 67% rainfall deficit last winter for intensifying water stress. With only 150 cubic meters of per capita water storage, Pakistan is among the most water-insecure countries globally, retaining just 10% of its river flows.But it’s not just Pakistan that’s vulnerable.India, which shares the Himalayan watershed and the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) with Pakistan, faces similar climate pressures. The 2022 floods, which killed 1,700 in Pakistan and inundated Indian regions, underscored the shared ecological risks tied to glacial retreat and erratic monsoons.The IWT, signed in 1960, has come under renewed strain. India suspended the treaty on April 23, 2025 following a terrorist attack in Kashmir’s Pahalgam. This halted data-sharing on river flows, leaving Pakistan exposed during the monsoon season.Pakistan suspects India’s water infrastructure push – including the Shahpurkandi and Ujh dams – could further disrupt downstream flows. But India too faces its own water anxieties, including unilateral dam operations and growing glacier-related threats in its Himalayan catchments.Analysts warn that lack of coordination on flood management could have catastrophic consequences for both countries. Experts call for restoring data exchange under IWT, investing in joint watershed management, and building early warning systems. With over 3,000 glacial lakes in Pakistan alone, the risk of future GLOFs looms large.As Swat mourns its dead and Gilgit-Baltistan braces for more floods, the Indus – a lifeline for both nations – is turning into a symbol of shared peril.","At least 72 people have died nationwide, including 14 in Swat and 23 in Astore.

The NDMA has urged local administrations to remain on high alert and advised tourists to steer clear of vulnerable areas, warning that continued rainfall could lead to further flooding and road blockages.Emergency services were already on heightened alert after a tragic incident last month in which 17 members of the same family were swept away by the Swat River.Thirteen bodies were recovered, including eight children, while four people were rescued.

Who is Tommy Robinson?







British far-right activist Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, has drawn fresh attention online after he posted on X ""Free Balochistan"". The post, shared with his more than one million followers on X (formerly Twitter), is the latest in a series of controversial statements from the 42-year-old figure known for his inflammatory views, legal troubles, and vocal presence on social media.Tensions are running high in Balochistan following a violent crackdown by authorities on a peaceful rally in Hub Chowki. The protest, organised by the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC), was held to denounce the extrajudicial killing of Zeeshan Zaheer, a BYC member from Panjgur, allegedly targeted by a state-backed death squad.The BYC reports that a large number of women, children, and families of forcibly disappeared persons had joined the rally. Despite the peaceful nature of the protest, security forces responded with aerial firing, tear gas shelling, and mass arrests once the demonstration ended. Among those detained were four women — Sadiya, Samina, Aseela, and Mehtab — and human rights activist Abdullah Baloch. More than 20 hours later, their whereabouts remain unknown, with no legal proceedings initiated.Robinson rose to prominence in the UK as the founder of the English Defence League (EDL), a far-right, anti-Islam group notorious for staging violent protests between 2009 and 2013.His activism has long focused on immigration, Islam, and what he describes as the failure of British authorities to confront crimes like grooming gang abuse.Over the years, he has been jailed for assault (2005), mortgage fraud (2014), and previous contempt of court offences (2019), the latter for filming defendants during a grooming gang trial and potentially jeopardising judicial proceedings.Robinson portrays himself as a whistleblower silenced by the state, gaining significant online backing, including from Elon Musk earlier this year, who reinstated Robinson’s X account and has echoed his claims about establishment failures in prosecuting child sexual exploitation cases.Musk had also advocated for his release from jail in January saying, ""Why is Tommy Robinson in a solitary confinement prison for telling the truth? He should be freed and those who covered up this travesty should take his place in that cell.""","British far-right activist Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley- Lennon, has drawn fresh attention online after he posted on X ""Free Balochistan"" The post is the latest in a series of controversial statements from the 42-year- old figure known for his inflammatory views.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122293019,imgsize-10580,width-400,resizemode-4/122293019.jpg"

Pakistan Offers Full Military Tribute To 'Kargil War Hero' Whose Body It Refused To Accept Earlier





ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s political battlefield has narrowed to two poles: Field Marshal Asim Munir , the army chief whose influence spans parliament, the judiciary and diplomacy, and Imran Khan , the jailed former prime minister who, despite his incarceration in Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail, remains the most potent political force in the country, commanding the street, the diaspora, and a digital army keeping his voice alive.This week, Khan issued a call for nationwide agitation after the 10th of Muharram, aiming to reignite mass mobilisation just as Field Marshal Munir stands at the peak of his institutional authority. The move comes amid growing public frustration over inflation, repression, and a system many believe has been engineered to exclude the electorate’s will.Two weeks ago, Munir met US President Donald Trump at the White House, a discreet engagement confirmed by diplomatic sources. According to insiders, Imran Khan’s fate and Pakistan’s internal political stability were among the topics discussed, particularly in light of pressure from the overseas Pakistani diaspora.Soon after, the Supreme Court awarded the PTI’s reserved seats to the ruling PML-N-PPP coalition, handing it a two-thirds supermajority in parliament — a legal outcome that critics say has effectively nullified the popular mandate from the Feb 2024 general elections.“It’s political elimination through judicial procedure,” said a senior legal analyst. “The system was rewritten to fit the result.”While Munir tours Washington, Riyadh and Beijing as Pakistan’s stabilising envoy, PTI’s political campaign has been pushed abroad, led by a vast online network of digital volunteers across the UK, North America and the Gulf. “You can erase a party from parliament, but not from memory,” said a PTI organiser in Birmingham. “We’ve made the diaspora the movement’s backbone.”PTI’s message – injustice, censorship, stolen mandate – is kept alive through platforms like YouTube, Telegram and X, forming a digital frontline that defies state control.Munir’s rising global stature – reinforced by high-profile diplomatic engagements – may yet prove to be a deceptive calm. History offers a cautionary echo: Pakistan’s military rulers from Ayub to Zia to Musharraf all basked in international legitimacy at their zeniths, only to be brought down by domestic discontent.With Khan’s post-Muharram agitation call threatening to spill onto the streets and economic despair combining with political anger, Munir’s firm grip on the state may soon face its first real stress test. What looks like consolidation could quickly unravel if the tide of public rage surpasses the system’s capacity to contain it.There is no serious civilian counterweight. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif holds office but not authority. The real contest is between Munir with unmatched institutional control, and Imran, the politician with unbroken public appeal.Field Marshal Munir may rule the state. But Imran Khan – even from a prison cell – continues to shape the struggle that could decide Pakistan’s political future.","Imran Khan remains the most potent political force in the country, commanding the street, the diaspora, and a digital army keeping his voice alive.

The death toll from the collapse of a five-storey residential building in Karachi’s Lyari area has risen to 27, according to officials quoted by Dawn on Sunday.Rescue teams continue to comb through the debris in search of survivors, days after the structure came crashing down near Lea Market on Fida Husain Shaikha Road.South deputy commissioner Javed Nabi Khoso said the rescue operation had continued overnight on Friday and was around 80 per cent complete by Saturday. Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan estimated that it would take another five to six hours to fully conclude the operation.Several individuals are still unaccounted for, though authorities say the exact number remains unclear as the search is ongoing.The Edhi Rescue Service confirmed that 27 bodies have been recovered so far, including nine women, 15 men and three children aged 13, 10 and one. Five people, among them three women, were also injured in the collapse.

He revealed that over 480 buildings in Karachi’s older city areas, mostly in District South, have been declared dangerous.He also pledged government support for those displaced by the incident, promising assistance in securing alternative housing.The chief minister said the collapsed building appeared to be newly constructed and lacked the necessary approvals. He warned of strict action against those responsible for unauthorised construction and urged residents to confirm the clearance of buildings with the Building Control Authority before purchasing or renting.Acknowledging that financial struggles often force people into unsafe living conditions, Shah stressed the need for stronger enforcement and public awareness to ensure safety is not compromised.","The death toll from the collapse of a five-storey residential building in Karachi’s Lyari area has risen to 27, according to officials quoted by Dawn on Sunday.

16 killed in Pakistan building crash,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/16-killed-in-pak-building-crash/articleshow/122274775.cms,"



KARACHI: The death toll from a collapsed multi-story residential building in southern Pakistan rose to 16 as search operations to find survivors continued for the second day.Rescuers pulled 10 more bodies from the rubble during an overnight operation, officials said Saturday.The govt-run Civil Hospital said in a statement it had received the 16 bodies, adding several of the injured had been hospitalised. Rescue workers are using heavy machinery to search for at least eight more survivors believed to be trapped under the debris, said emergency officials.Residents said the building was located on a narrow street, hampering efforts to bring in additional heavy equipment. Television footage showed rescuers removing debris as relatives of those still trapped cried and prayed for the safety of their loved ones.Building collapses are common in Pakistan, where construction standards are often poorly enforced. Many structures are built with substandard materials, and safety regulations are frequently ignored to cut costs. In June 2020, an apartment building collapsed in Karachi, killing 22.","Rescuers pull 10 more bodies from the rubble during an overnight operation.
