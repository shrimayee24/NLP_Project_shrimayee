(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

GHAZIABAD: “My only aim now is to become an achiever in life, something people know me for,” a 15-year-old girl told TOI on Saturday as she returned to school after three traumatic weeks. During this period, she was sexually assaulted by a neighbour, closeted herself in at home as the family feared social shame, and saw her name being struck off the school rolls.The scrapping of her enrolment came with a rebuke from her government school principal who – unaware of the girl’s reason for absence – told her father on Thursday to get her married if he wasn’t interested in sending her to class.It was mistimed scorn, which the principal realised on Friday when she was informed about the sexual assault. But word had spread by then. The principal drew heavy criticism on social media as the sexual assault on the girl, the removal of her name from school and her comments to her father conflated into one narrative.Education department officials stepped in on Friday after they learnt about the police case that the teen ’s parents had filed after the June 26 sexual assault. School had reopened on July 1 after the summer vacations, but she hadn’t shown up. Three other girls hadn’t either. It was seen as unexplained absence, and on July 10, the principal decided to scratch their names from the rolls. According to officials, in all cases of absence from school, a student must write a note to the class teacher or principal with specific reasons for absence. The girl’s father told TOI on Saturday she had not stepped out of home since the June 26 incident because of shock. He also spoke of being worried for her safety because the assailant – a married man – lives in the same colony.The accused, who had allegedly met her at Swarn Jayanti park several times, is now in judicial custody, police said, after being charged with rape and criminal intimidation under sections of BNS and provisions of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act. He had on June 16 invited her to meet him at a hotel, where he took her to a room and allegedly raped her. “She left for tuition, which generally gets over by 2pm,” the father said. Usually, she is back by 3.30pm but that day, wasn’t home till 6pm. “She looked pale when she returned and did not talk. Next day, I asked her about it and that’s when she told me about the incident,” he said. The episode derailed the family. The girl isolated herself as she tried to cope. The parents wept and worried. Amid this despair, the school de-rostered her. On Friday night, however, the principal was at their door, her manner and demeanor nothing like the voice on the phone that had chided the father. The principal told TOI on Saturday she re-enrolled the girl after the district inspector of schools informed her about the sexual assault case and decided to go speak to the girl herself to convince her to continue with her education. “The girls whose names were withdrawn did not inform the school about their absence.We have come across several instances of girls dropping out because their families got them married. I thought she wasn’t coming to school for the same reason,” she said of her July 11 call to the teenager’s father. It (the de-rostering) was meant as a warning. At that time, I didn’t know what had happened. Once I knew, I personally met the family. We spoke for around three hours,” she added. The girl’s father confirmed the principal had met them, underlined the need for her to return to school and extended her support. “Education is important. We realise that,” he said. On Saturday, the teenager took a step back towards restoring normalcy to her life and returned to school. But the most familiar of places seemed altered. “It was strange. Everyone was looking at me. It seemed like many things had changed. But my friends came and spoke to me. With time, I guess things will be normal,” she said. Her school bag is packed for Monday.","15-year-old girl was sexually assaulted by a neighbour, closeted herself in at home as the family feared social shame, and saw her name struck off the school rolls.

Satellite images signal architectural wealth under Bodh Gaya shrine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/satellite-images-signal-architectural-wealth-under-bodh-gaya-shrine/articleshow/111723582.cms,"PATNA: A geospatial analysis utilising satellite images and ground surveys has found evidence of the presence of ""huge architectural wealth"" buried in the Mahabodhi temple complex and its surroundings in Bihar's Bodh Gaya , officials said on Saturday.The study has been carried out by Bihar Heritage Development Society , a wing of Art, Culture and Youth Department, in collaboration with Cardiff University in UK.The Mahabodhi temple complex, a UNESCO World Heritage site , is one of the four holy areas related to the life of Lord Gautam Buddha. Bodh Gaya is a place where Lord Buddha is believed to have attained enlightenment.""The study has unearthed evidence of the presence of archaeological treasure beneath the soil of the UNESCO World Heritage site and its surrounding areas...It's a huge architectural wealth that needs further excavation,"" the Art, Culture and Youth department's additional chief secretary Harjot Kaur Bamhrah told a news agency.The UK-based varsity and BHDS are cooperating in the project, 'Archaeology on the footsteps of the Chinese traveller Xuanzang'.Bengaluru-based National Institute of Advanced Studies faculty M B Rajni, one of the project members, studied satellite images of Mahabodhi temple and its surroundings and tried to correlate the findings with the description of 'Xuanzang', she said.""BHDS in association with Cardiff University has been working on the multidisciplinary project on the archaeological trail of the travel of 7th-century Chinese translator monk, Xuanzang, in Bihar. The satellite images from the last several years show an alignment of structures to the north of the temple, buried underground,"" said Bamhrah.Significantly, the images show the shift of the river Niranjana from east to west.""Let us remember that the Mahabodhi temple is west of the river, and the Sujata Stupa and several other archaeological remains are located east of the river. The monuments and other archaeological remains in the east of the river are now regarded to be independent of the Mahabodhi temple. But the latest finding shows that both the temple and the Sujata stupa along with other archaeological remains stood on the same river bank in the past,"" she said.Bamhrah said this is really ""very significant"". ""Thus, there is a strong possibility that the monuments and other archaeological remains, now east of the river, were a part of the Mahabodhi complex,"" the official said.BHDS plans to start ""research to delimit the boundaries of the Mahabodhi complex in the light of these findings"", Bamhrah said. ""Fresh ground-penetrating radar (GPR) survey, followed by excavations, will be undertaken to unravel the buried archaeological features shown by satellite images,"" she added.","Geospatial analysis utilising satellite images and ground surveys has found evidence of the presence of ""huge architectural wealth"" buried in the Mahabodhi temple complex and its surroundings in Bihar's Bodh Gaya.

'Seva-paani ka mauka do': SpiceJet staff who slapped CISF personnel alleges 'sexual harassment',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/seva-paani-ka-mauka-do-spicejet-staff-who-slapped-cisf-personnel-alleges-sexual-harassment/articleshow/111716623.cms,"A SpiceJet staff member who was arrested for slapping a CISF assistant sub-inspector at Jaipur Airport has now alleged that she was sexually harassed by the ASI, which led her to take such action.According to the SpiceJet staff, ASI Giriraj Prasad approached her on July 11 at 4.30 am while she was on duty and made inappropriate comments.""I report for duty at the same time.Like every day, at 4:30 am on 11th July, I was doing my work when ASI Giriraj Prasad came and said, ‘Give us a chance to take care of you (Humey bhi apna seva-paani ka mauka do)’. Then, when I asked him to call a lady constable for frisking. He again said, 'How much money will you charge for a night (Ek raat rukne ka kya logi)',"" the SpiceJet employee said.She added, ""He said, 'Listen to me, you'll feel better. Your work will get done quickly.' I told him that I would file a police complaint against you to which he said 'You can't do anything to me. I have seen a lot of women like you, I'll get you fired.'""The incident came to light after a video of the female employee slapping the CISF ASI at Jaipur Airport on Thursday went viral. Following a complaint filed by ASI Prasad, the police arrested the SpiceJet employee. In his complaint, Prasad alleged that during a disagreement regarding security screening procedures at the airport, the employee slapped him.However, the SpiceJet employee, who has been working with the airline for five years, refuted these claims. She said that she had a valid airport entry pass and was well-versed with the rules and regulations. She also mentioned that there is usually a female staff member present in the morning, but not at night and that they coordinate with the female staff on a daily basis.She said, “Their [ASI Prasad's] statement that I was forcing to go inside and that I did not have a valid card is wrong. We meet CISF staff every day but usually, we coordinate with the female staff. We do not even talk to the male staff on a daily basis...There is a female staff member there in the morning every day, but there are no female staff members at night. It happens every day that we take the catering van, give them the slip and we go towards the departure hall. There is never any female staff there.”SpiceJet has issued a statement supporting their employee and has approached the local police to take legal action against the CISF personnel for sexual harassment. The airline said, ""SpiceJet is taking immediate legal action in this serious case of sexual harassment against its female employee and has approached the local police. We stand firmly by our employee and are committed to providing her with full support.""Earlier, advocate Deepak Chouhan, the legal representative for the SpiceJet Airlines employee accused of slapping a CISF assistant sub-inspector at Jaipur Airport, claimed that his client was subjected to 'sexual harassment' by the police officer, which provoked her to take such action.Speaking to ANI on Friday, Advocate Deepak Chouhan said, ""The SpiceJet employee has been arrested. She was sexually harassed by the CISF ASI at Jaipur Airport. Abusive words were used against her, which caused her to lose her cool and slap the CISF officer . This was her natural response to the incident.""The advocate also stressed that the female employee had no prior history of such behaviour, suggesting that this was an isolated incident triggered by the alleged harassment.""In court FIR, we have mentioned that the woman had not displayed such behaviour in the past. Had this been her usual behavior, such incidents would have come to light earlier. However, this is a matter of investigation,"" Advocate Chouhan added, indicating that the case requires further inquiry to establish the facts surrounding the incident.","SpiceJet employee arrested for slapping a CISF assistant sub-inspector at Jaipur Airport.

Pakistan news channel airs interview with Hizbul Mujahideen commander amid rising terror attacks in J&K,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-news-channel-airs-interview-with-hizbul-mujahideen-commander-amid-rising-terror-attacks-in-jk/articleshow/111716126.cms,"

Implications of the interview being aired:

It demonstrates Pakistan's continued support for terrorist organizations like Hizbul Mujahideen that are designated as such by several countries, including India. By providing a platform for the group to propagate its ideology and activities, Pakistan is enabling the spread of extremism.

The commander's remarks glorifying past acts of terrorism and outlining future plans are alarming. His emphasis on confronting the Indian Army and the significance of declaring Burhan Wani, a Hizbul Mujahideen militant, as a hero suggests the group's intent to escalate violence.

Pakistan's actions in providing a platform for Hizbul Mujahideen's propaganda are likely to worsen the already strained India-Pakistan ties.

NEW DELHI: In a surprising development, a local digital news network in Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK), conducted an interview with Shamsher Khan, a high-ranking commander of Hizbul Mujahideen -- an organisation designated as a terrorist group by the European Union, India, Canada, and the United States.The interview, uploaded by JK Bol, shows Shamsher Khan discussing the organization's past acts of terrorism and outlining their future sinister intentions.During the interview, the commander emphasised the significance of Pakistan 's Prime Minister declaring Burhan Wani, a Hizbul Mujahideen militant, as a hero at the United Nations. He also remarked that their objective was to ""actively confront the Indian Army and prevent them from being at ease"".This interview comes at a time when terrorist activities are on the rise in Jammu and Kashmir. Recently, five Indian Army personnel were killed, and five others were injured in a terrorist ambush, while nine people were killed and 41 injured in a terrorist attack on a bus travelling to the Mata Vaishno Devi shrine.Hizbul Mujahideen, founded in 1989, aims to establish an Islamic state in Kashmir and seeks the merger of Jammu and Kashmir with Pakistan.The group has been responsible for numerous kidnappings, killings of civilians and security personnel, bombings, and targeted assassinations of political leaders and individuals during the 1990s.Pakistan's decision to provide a platform for interviews with leaders of designated terrorist organizations like Hizbul Mujahideen is a concerning aspect of the country's stance on terrorism.This interview demonstrates how Pakistan's agents allow such groups to propagate their ideologies and activities, potentially influencing public opinion.The interview with Hizbul Mujahideen commander Shamsher Khan has several concerning implications for the security situation in the region.","A local digital news network in Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK) conducted an interview with Shamsher Khan, a high-ranking commander of Hizbul Mujahideen.

The warden who is supposed to stay overnight at hostel, leaves the premises over to a woman guard and goes to her home, leaving girls vulnerable.In such a negligence, a minor 16-year-old girl was impregnated by an unknown person and the whole matter was hushed up by Kujur and the girl was sent back home, without giving exams, in April.The warden didn’t make efforts to find the one responsible for pregnancy nor reported the matter to her seniors, despite that it falls under Pocso act.The matter reached the local people only when the classmates of girls were terrified with the whole incident that the survivor was prevented from appearing for exams and they told their parents.The villagers also asked not to deploy any male staff at girl’s hostel as they are left vulnerable in such a situation.

JAIPUR: A scuffle broke out between a female crew member of a private airline and an assistant sub-inspector (ASI) of the Central Industrial Security Force ( CISF ) at Jaipur International Airport early Thursday morning.The city’s airport police station arrested the crew member following a complaint from the ASI, who alleged that she slapped him when he asked her for security screening.The woman also lodged a counter complaint against the ASI.SHO (Airport) Moti Lal told TOI that the woman was arrested under the Bharat Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) sections 121(1) (voluntarily causing hurt or grievous hurt to deter a public servant from his duty) and 132 (assault or criminal force to deter a public servant).The police said the incident occurred when the woman was entering the airport along with other staff around 4am and was stopped by the ASI, who said she did not have valid permission to use that gate. The ASI reportedly asked her to undergo screening, but no woman CISF personnel were available at the gate at that time. While the ASI called for a woman CISF personnel for the security check, the argument had already escalated.DCP (East) Kavendra Singh Sagar said that the woman also filed an FIR against the ASI under BNS section 75 (sexual harassment). “Two cross complaints have been lodged in the matter and the probe is underway,” Sagar said.

Trump later posted on Truth Social that he was ""shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear.""A witness named Greg told the BBC that he observed an armed individual on a rooftop just minutes before gunshots were heard at a rally for Donald Trump in Butler County, Pennsylvania. According to Greg, the man had climbed onto the roof of a nearby building, situated approximately 50 feet from the event.Greg said that he alerted the police to the presence of the gunman. ""I'm thinking to myself 'Why is Trump still speaking, why have they not pulled him off the stage'... the next thing you know, five shots ring out,"" he recounted.Greg added that he had noticed the gunman about five minutes into Trump's speech and attempted to alert the authorities for several minutes, but he believes they may have had difficulty spotting the gunman due to the roof's slope.As the gravity of the situation sank in, tensions rose among the crowd. Some Trump supporters hurled insults at the media, while others made vulgar gestures towards the area where the gunshots seemed to have originated. The shooter was reportedly ""outside the grounds,"" according to the Butler County district attorney. Secret Service officers urged the crowd to evacuate, declaring the area an active crime scene.Following the gunshots, Secret Service agents immediately surrounded the former president and escorted him to safety. Trump was later seen with blood on his face and reportedly said that a bullet had grazed his ear. Officials later confirmed that the gunman had been shot and killed.","Shots were heard at a rally for Donald Trump in Butler County, Pennsylvania.

During Trump’s 2016 campaign, a 20-year-old British man attempted to grab a gun from a Las Vegas police officer at a Trump rally there. He later told police he was trying to kill Trump, and pleaded guilty to federal firearms and disruption offenses.

Ronald Reagan

On March 30, 1981, John Hinckley Jr fired six shots at the president in Washington, hitting Reagan and three others. The president was seriously wounded but recovered after emergency surgery. The other three victims also survived. Hinckley was immediately arrested and kept in institutional psychiatric care until 2016, 12 years after Reagan’s death.

Gerald Ford

Lynette “Squeaky” Fromme, a follower of cult leader Charles Manson, attempted to shoot Ford in Sacramento, California on September 5, 1975. Three weeks later, Sara Jane Moore fired a shot at Ford in San Francisco, making the two women the most prominent female would-be assassins in US history.

Robert F Kennedy

Sirhan Sirhan shot and killed Kennedy, then a candidate in the Democratic primaries, in Los Angeles on June 5, 1968, less than five years after the assassination of his elder brother. Sirhan was sentenced to life in prison. Kennedy’s son, Robert F Kennedy Jr, is running as an independent presidential candidate in 2024.

John F Kennedy

On November 22, 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald shot and killed the president in Dallas, Texas. The assassination continues to spark debates about whether Oswald acted alone, after Oswald was killed by restaurateur Jack Ruby two days later.

Theodore Roosevelt

Roosevelt was a former president campaigning to return to the White House when he was shot giving a speech in Milwaukee on Oct. 14, 1912. Protected by the 50-page text of his speech and a glasses case in his pocket, he continued his address and recovered, eventually losing to Woodrow Wilson. Would-be assassin John Schrank was found legally insane and institutionalized until his death.

William McKinley

McKinley was shot in Buffalo, New York on September 6, 1901, and later died from his wounds, elevating Vice President Roosevelt to the presidency. Anarchist Leon Czolgosz was convicted of the assassination and put to death.

James Garfield

Garfield was shot in Washington July 2, 1881. He died from complications from the wounds two months later. Writer and lawyer Charles Guiteau was convicted of the crime and sentenced to death.

Abraham Lincoln

Lincoln was shot and killed in Washington on April 14, 1865, by John Wilkes Booth, a well-known actor and Confederate sympathizer, who was killed after a manhunt that lasted nearly two weeks.

The shooting of former President Donald Trump Saturday was only the most recent act of political violence that has often shaped US history.Trump said he was “fine” after a bullet grazed his ear during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The attacker was killed by Secret Service agents, and one other person at the event died. Authorities are investigating Saturday’s attack as an assassination attempt.The killings of Abraham Lincoln, James Garfield and William McKinley eventually led to Secret Service protection, and the assassination of John F Kennedy shocked the nation and resulted in even tighter security around the president.Still, Gerald Ford was the target of two high-profile attempts on his life in the span of 18 days, and Ronald Reagan was seriously wounded by a gunman’s bullet early in his presidency in 1981.Nearly ever modern president has been targeted. The Secret Service has foiled nearly all of those attempts, few of which resulted in injury.Political violence has taken the lives of leaders around the world, as well, including Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme.Even before Saturday’s incident, polls showed voters worried about possible violence surrounding this year’s presidential election. A Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll of swing-state in May found half harbored those fears, including roughly equal shares of Democrats and Republicans. And they’re even more common among independents, the poll found.Here’s a look at some previous attempts on US presidents’ and presidential candidates’ lives:","Nearly ever modern president has been targeted.

Drawing large television and online audiences, next week’s convention is likely to fire up core Republican supporters ahead of the November election.Trump’s campaign has outlined themes for each day of the convention that riff on his red-hat rallying cry: “Make America Great Again.” Over 50,000 people are expected to attend. That includes some 2,429 “delegates” — a mix of politicians and grassroots activists — who will vote for the candidate who won their state’s nominating contest earlier this year. In almost every part of America, that’s Trump.Meanwhile, Donald Trump, famed for his unpredictable and inflammatory outbursts, is opting for self-censorship in a bid to expand his electorate to more moderate voters ahead of the US presidential election. The 78-year-old billionaire appears to be dialing back his rhetoric on key issues such as immigration and abortion — a tactic that analysts say is buoyed by his confidence in the loyalty of his conservative base ahead of November’s vote.Trump, who will officially become the Republican presidential nominee at the party’s convention next week, has also denounced a controversial document called “Project 2025.” The 900-page text — seen as a governing roadmap and drafted by a conservative think tank with some of Trump’s close allies — was subject to harsh criticism for its calls for mass deportations of migrants and a weakening of federal agencies.(With inputs from AFP, AP)","The Republican National Convention (RNC) comes as Democrats are engulfed in turmoil, with President Joe Biden facing calls to drop out of the race.

This was the last case keeping Khan in prison but he will not walk free as the authorities immediately issued fresh orders for his arrest in three other cases.In a short order, additional sessions judge Afzal Majoka directed authorities to immediately release Khan and his wife if they are not wanted in any other case.After the decision Khan’s party, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), said, “Mr Khan has been arrested in three more cases.” The three cases are linked to violence against the military and other state installations after his brief arrest in May 2023.“An anti-terrorism court in Lahore approved the request to arrest Imran Khan in the May 9 case,” the PTI statement read. The party warned that keeping Khan, 71, in jail after Saturday’s decision would lead to another political crisis.Just days before national polls on Feb 8 the couple were sentenced to seven years in jail in the “iddat” case after the court found them guilty of breaking Islamic law by failing to observe the required interval between Bibi’s divorce from her previous husband and her marriage to Khan. The verdict had coincided with his convictions and sentences in the Toshakhana (state treasure store) and cipher cases. His sentences in two alleged graft cases, however, were suspended, while his sentence in the cipher case, linked to leaking of state secrets, was overturned. Various courts have also freed him in several other cases linked to the events of May 9, 2023 when his first arrest had caused riots across the country, following which the state launched a crackdown against him and his party.Ahead of Khan’s acquittal in a fake marriage case , a pair of applications was filed by Khawar Fareed Maneka, Bushra’s previous husband. One application asked the court to carry out a medical checkup of his ex-wife to ascertain her menstrual cycle while the other called on religious scholars for consultation on further deliberation on the duration of “iddat”.Before ordering Khan and his wife’s release, judge Majoka dismissed both applications. “Both petitions seeking the formation of a medical board and consultations with religious scholars are hereby rejected,” the verdict stated.Khan has been behind bars since August 2023.

Judge Majoka announced the judgment in the afternoon after reserving the verdict earlier in the day, acquitting Khan, 71, and Bushra, 49.""If they are not wanted in any other case, then PTI founder Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi should be released [from jail] immediately,"" the judge said after accepting their appeals. However, it was not immediately clear if Khan would be released, as this was the only case for which he was currently imprisoned following the suspension of his Toshakhana corruption case sentence and acquittal in the cipher case.Imran Khan, the cricketer-turned-politician, has been behind bars since August last year after being sentenced in the Toshakhana corruption case and subsequently convicted in other cases ahead of the February 8 elections.Maneka filed the case against the couple in November 2023, alleging that they married without observing the mandatory Iddat period. He sought to have the marriage declared null and void.Khan and Bibi married in 2018, the same year Khan won the general elections and became prime minister. Bibi, who was ostensibly Khan's spiritual guide, divorced her husband of 28 years, with whom she had five children, and developed a romantic relationship with Khan. She is Khan's third wife; during his cricketing career, Khan had a reputation as a playboy.PTI chief Gohar Khan welcomed the verdict, calling it a victory for the independent judiciary. ""All these cases were fake, and he will also get justice in all other cases,"" he said, demanding Imran Khan's immediate release as this was the last case in which he was convicted.This judgment follows a major legal victory for Khan's PTI party.

As a result, over 600,000 Afghans have fled Pakistan since the order was issued last year. Human rights organizations have cautioned that some of those sent back to Afghanistan may face persecution by the Taliban , who took power in 2021 and have implemented strict Islamic laws, denying girls access to higher education and excluding women and girls from many areas of public life.Malala, who grew up in Pakistan's Swat valley and had to relocate to the UK after being shot at the age of 15 for resisting the Pakistan Taliban's ban on girls' education, emphasized the importance of protecting girls and women, given the bleak future they face in Afghanistan. She expressed hope that Pakistan would reverse its policy, stating, ""I hope that Pakistan reverses its policy and that they protect girls and women especially because of the dark future that they would be witnessing in Afghanistan"".On her birthday, recognized by the UN as Malala Day, the activist addressed the challenges faced by Afghan girls, who have been banned from education for over three years. While finding the situation shocking, she admired the resilience of Afghan activists. The Malala Fund is advocating for the UN to formally expand its definition of crimes against humanity to include ""gender apartheid,"" a term used by the UN to describe the situation in Afghanistan.Malala criticised the recent talks between the UN and the Taliban in Doha, which took place without the presence of women. She called for a ""principled engagement"" with the Taliban and urged world leaders to realize that excluding women and girls from such discussions is doing the Taliban a favor.She specifically called out countries with feminist foreign policies, such as Canada and France, to condemn such conversations.Furthermore, Malala called for an urgent ceasefire in the ongoing war in Gaza, expressing concern over the bombing of schools in the region. She emphasized the importance of providing humanitarian support to innocent civilians and praised countries that have resumed funding for UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, despite Israeli accusations of its workers being involved in Hamas's attack against Israel on October 7.","Malala Yousafzai has expressed deep concern over Pakistan's decision to deport undocumented Afghan refugees.

After the polls, they had joined the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) party to claim a share of reserved seats as independents were not eligible for the extra seats. The electoral body, however, ruled that the SIC was not entitled to claim the reserved seats “due to having non-curable legal defects and violation of a mandatory provision of submission of party list for reserved seats.”The commission had decided to distribute the seats among other parliamentary parties, with the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz ( PML-N ) and the Pakistan Peoples’ Party (PPP) becoming major beneficiaries with 16 and five additional seats in the National Assembly.Friday’s verdict, however, nullified the Peshawar high court’s order wherein it had upheld the election regulator’s decision denying the reserved seats to the SIC. The top court also declared the ECP’s ruling to be ultra vires to the constitution, without lawful authority and of no legal effect.“It is declared that lack of denial of an election symbol does not in any way affect the right of a political party to participate in an election,” the court order said, adding that PTI was and is a political party.It further stated that the elected members of PTI could not be declared independents or candidates of the SIC and gave the PTI 15 days to submit its list of candidates entitled for reserved seats to the election commission.ECP, the order said, should then publish the list of reserved seats of the candidates on its website within seven days.“The seats allocated to the PTI after this stage will be considered as their seats. Once the PTI gets its seats in parliament, it will be eligible for the reserved seats,” said the ruling.PTI spokesman Raoof Hassan lauded the SC for “breaking the barriers of intimidation”. “This is only the beginning of a long haul till we reach the final destination when Imran Khan shall take over as the Pakistan PM,” he said.The governing coalition still has well over 200 members of the 336-member lower house of parliament but the judgment has effectively denied a two-third majority to them that they were hoping for. Khan’s party strength stood at 84 in the National Assembly before the decision and is expected to rise to over 100.Under Pakistan’s election rules, parties are allocated 70 reserved seats – 60 for women, 10 for non-Muslims – in proportion to the number of seats they win. This completes the National Assembly’s total strength of 336 seats.",The Supreme Court of Pakistan on Friday declared his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party eligible for allocation of seats reserved for women and non-Muslims.

However, the election commission had stated that independents were not eligible for the allocation of 70 reserved seats , which were intended solely for political parties.The SC placed the present petitions before the three-judge committee that determines the constitution of the bench for the reconstitution of a larger bench when attorney general Mansoor Usman Awan highlighted that under Section 4 of the SC (Practice and Procedure) Act 2023, the present case should be heard by a larger bench since the issue concerns the interpretation of constitutional provisions, Dawn reported.A day ago, the court had reserved its decision on the matter after closing the hearing on a set of appe­als moved by the PTI-backed Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC).The SIC had filed a petition demanding that 77 seats for women and minorities, which were originally allotted to PM Shehbaz’s ruling coalition after the February 8 general elections, be reallocated to the alliance. However, in March, the Peshawar high court (PHC) and the election commission rejected the council’s appeal in separate rulings, declaring it ineligible for the reserved seats, as per the Dawn.Although the allocation of 23 reserved seats does not impact PM Shehbaz Sharif's coalition government's parliamentary majority, it does strengthen the political position of Khan's supporters. They have been claiming that the election commission and a pro-military caretaker government that supervised the polls engaged in electoral fraud to prevent them from winning. Both the commission and the military refute these allegations, but concerns have been raised in the West regarding the transparency of the elections.",Pakistan's Supreme Court on Friday said that former Prime Minister Imran Khan's party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) is eligible for seats reserved for women and minorities. A bench of 13 members announced the verdict and puts increased pressure on the country's fragile coalition government. The election commission had stated that independents were not eligible for the allocation of 70 reserved seats.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111684925,imgsize-24226,width-400,resizemode-4/111684925.jpg"
