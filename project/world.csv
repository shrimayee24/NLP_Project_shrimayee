'No degree of drama can conceal facts': India responds to Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif's remarks at UN; slams 'absurd theatrics',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-degree-of-drama-can-conceal-facts-india-responds-to-pakistan-pm-shehbaz-sharifs-remarks-at-un-slams-absurd-theatrics/articleshow/124174820.cms,"Pakistan PM Sharif’s UNGA Propaganda Parade: Fake Op Sindoor Victory & Nobel Call For Donald Trump

NEW DELHI: India on Saturday delivered a sharp rebuttal to Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif ’s speech at the UN General Assembly, dismissing his remarks as “absurd theatrics” and asserting that “no degree of drama can conceal facts.”Indian diplomat Petal Gahlot, exercising the right of reply, sharply criticised Pakistan. “This assembly witnessed absurd theatrics in the morning from the Prime Minister of Pakistan, who once again glorified terrorism that is so central to their foreign policy,” Gahlot said.Pointing to Pakistan’s record on terrorism, Gahlot highlighted Islamabad’s role in the Pahalgam attack. “No degree of drama and no level of lies can conceal the facts. This is the very same Pakistan which, at the UN Security Council on 25th April 2025, shielded the resistance front - a Pakistani-sponsored terror outfit -- from the responsibility of carrying out the barbaric massacre of tourists in the Indian Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir,” she said.Recalling Pakistan’s history of sheltering terrorists, Gahlot said, “A country long steeped in the tradition of deploying and exporting terrorism has no shame in advancing the most ludicrous narratives to that end. Let us recall that it sheltered Osama bin Laden for a decade, even while pretending to partner in the war against terrorism. Its ministers have just recently acknowledged that they have been operating terrorist camps for decades.It should come as no surprise that once again this duplicity continues, this time at the level of its Prime Minister.”Earlier in the day, Pakistan PM Sharif used his UNGA speech to echo Donald Trump ’s claims, saying the US President played an “active role” in brokering a ceasefire between India and Pakistan after military action in May.Sharif alleged that India sought “political gains” after the Pahalgam attack and accused New Delhi of targeting “innocent civilians” while remaining silent on Islamabad’s own support for crossborder terrorism.“In May this year, my country confronted unprovoked aggression from our eastern front. The enemy came shrouded in arrogance, and we sent them back in humiliation. India sought to extract political gains from a human tragedy by spurning my sincere offer of an independent investigation into the Pahalgam incident. Instead, it attacked our cities and targeted our innocent civilians. When our territorial integrity and national security were violated, our response was in accordance with the right of self-defence under Article 51 of the United Nations charter,” Sharif said.Sharif also repeated his earlier false claim that Pakistan had shot down Indian fighter jets. He asserted that Pakistan’s forces responded with “stunning professionalism,” saying they repelled the aggression and “shot down seven Indian jets, sending them to scrap and dust.”In addition, Sharif raised the issue of the Indus Water Treaty , accusing India of violating its provisions.","Indian diplomat Petal Gahlot, exercising the right of reply, sharply criticised Pakistan. “This assembly witnessed absurd theatrics in the morning from the Prime Minister of Pakistan, who once again glorified terrorism that is so central to their foreign policy,” she said.

"Ladakh violence: LAB admits 'youngsters went out of control', says cops 'fired without warning'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ladakh-violence-lab-admits-youngsters-went-out-of-control-says-cops-fired-without-warning/articleshow/124163525.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Leh Apex Body (LAB) on Friday rejected claims of a “foreign hand” in the recent violence in Leh that left four people dead and nearly 90 injured, while demanding a judicial probe into the incident.LAB co-chairman Chering Dorjay admitted that the violence on September 24 spiralled after “youngsters went out of control” but alleged that police and Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel responded with excessive force, firing directly at protesters without using standard crowd-control measures such as water cannons or warning shots.“We tried to restrain them, but the police fired indiscriminately. There was no warning, no tear gas, no water cannon. Most of the injured were hit by bullets or pellets, which shows excessive use of force,” Dorjay told reporters.The protest was triggered after discontent over the Centre scheduling talks with LAB for October 6, despite worsening health conditions of participants in a hunger strike led by climate activist Sonam Wangchuk. According to Dorjay, more than 7,500 people, largely youth, gathered at the strike venue on September 24, compared to the usual 500.The agitation soon escalated into stone-pelting at the Hill Development Council office and vandalism at a BJP office.Dismissing allegations that the mob was armed, Dorjay said, “There was an attempt to give it an anti-national colour. Protesters removed party flags but did not touch the national flag. Many even carried the tricolour.”He also refuted suggestions by Ladakh Lieutenant Governor Kavinder Gupta and others about foreign involvement, calling it an attempt to deflect blame. “If there was a foreign hand, what were the security agencies doing? Outsiders may have been injured, but that was because of indiscriminate firing,” he said.Dorjay further claimed that newly deployed CRPF personnel beat up bystanders and that the force’s presence was part of a plan to “suppress the movement.”On the way forward, he said the LAB has sought bail for those detained and will resume talks with the Union home ministry after the funerals of the victims. “It is crucial to know why live bullets were used on the head and chest. A judicial probe is essential to establish accountability,” he added.","Leh Apex Body rejects claims of a ‘foreign hand’ in the recent violence in Leh that left four people dead and nearly 90 injured.

Poll Do you believe that the U.S. government should have stricter measures against identity fraud in immigration? Yes, definitely No, current measures are sufficient





The Donald Trump administration busted a major scam involving identity change to stay in the country by an Indian-origin man. Meet Gurdev Singh Sohal, also known as Dev Singh, also known as Boota Singh Sundu -- the man goes by various identities since he was ordered to be deported in 1994. The administration now revealed that instead of leaving the country, Singh changed his identity and got citizenship in 2005.The name Dev Singh had an exclusion order and his pushed that identity to oblivion to become Gurdev Sohal. He did not disclose his prior immigration history under the Dev Singh identity in any of his immigration applications or proceedings when he naturalized.Expert analysis in February 2020 confirmed that the fingerprints submitted under both identities came from the same individual. The analysis was only made possible after DHS digitized the paper fingerprint submission documents from older immigration files, Justice department documents revealed. “If you lie to the government or hide your identity so that you can naturalize, this Administration will find you and strip you of your fraudulently acquired US citizenship. ” said Assistant Attorney General Brett A. Shumate of the Justice Department’s Civil Division.The DoJ filed a civil denaturalization complaint against Sohl and said he illegally procured his US citizenship because he was never lawfully admitted for permanent residence. The lies he told throughout his naturalization process rendered him unable to show the requisite good moral character to naturalize, the document said. A third count charged Sohal with procuring his naturalization by concealment or willful misrepresentation of his prior identity and immigration proceedings.","Indian-origin man's citizenship revoked in US as he created new identity and became citizen in 2005, a decade after he was asked to leave.

Israeli military transfers data as Microsoft cuts access





Microsoft has cut off cloud computing and AI services to an Israeli military intelligence unit after an investigation revealed the technology was being used for mass surveillance of Palestinian civilians. The tech giant made the decision following a Guardian investigation that exposed how Israel's Unit 8200 stored millions of intercepted Palestinian phone calls on Microsoft's Azure platform.Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and vice chair, announced the termination in an internal memo to employees, stating the company found ""evidence that supports elements of The Guardian's reporting."" The blocked services include cloud storage and AI technologies that Unit 8200 had used to collect and analyze up to ""a million calls an hour"" from Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.An Israeli security official downplayed the impact, telling CNN there is ""no damage to the operational capabilities of the IDF."" Neither the Israel Defense Forces nor the Ministry of Defense responded to requests for comment about the service termination.The No Azure for Apartheid group, which includes of Microsoft employees, had been pressured Microsoft for over a year through protests and demonstrations, called the decision a significant win.""Today's news is a significant and unprecedented win for the campaign and our organizing,"" said Hossam Nasr, an organizer with the group, noting Microsoft became ""the first US tech company to stop the sale of some technologies to the Israeli military since the start of the genocide in Gaza. ""However, the activist group said the action doesn't go far enough, as Microsoft only disabled services to a single unit while ""the vast majority of Microsoft's contract with the Israeli military remains intact."" The group vowed to continue organizing until all their demands are met.The company said it applies its anti-surveillance principles globally and has maintained this stance for over two decades, with Smith noting that customer privacy commitments prevented Microsoft from accessing the surveillance data directly during its investigation.Intelligence sources told the Guardian that Unit 8200 quickly moved the massive data trove out of Microsoft's Dutch servers within days of the original investigation's publication in August. The unit reportedly plans to transfer the surveillance data to Amazon Web Services, though Amazon has not responded to requests for comment.Smith emphasized that Microsoft ""does not provide technology to facilitate mass surveillance of civilians"" and noted the decision doesn't affect the company's broader relationship with Israel, including cybersecurity work.

Big Win For Trump Amid Trade Faceoff With China, TikTok Algorithm Now Under American Oversight

Trump: “American operated all the way”



What’s Next







US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order approving the proposal sale of TikTok’s US operations to an American investor group. With this move, the Trump administration aims to resolve the long‑standing national security concerns while keeping the popular video app available to millions of U.S. users. As reported by Reuters, Vice President JD Vance revealed that the agreement values TikTok’s US business at $14 billion. The executive order signed by Trump temporarily bars the Department of Justice from enforcing a law that would have forced TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance face a nationwide ban.Under the deal, TikTok US will now form a new board of directors. Also, the recommendations algorithm, source code and content moderation systems of TikTok will be transferred to the new owners. As per the executive order signed by Trump, Oracle will now oversee TikTok’s US security operations and also offer cloud services.Also, investors including Oracle, Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based MGX are said to take around 45% stake in the new entity. ""There was some resistance on the Chinese side, but the fundamental thing that we wanted to accomplish is that we wanted to keep TikTok operating, but we also wanted to make sure that we protected Americans' data privacy as required by law,"" Vance told Reuters.As reported by Reuters, Trump has told the reporters that he had a word with Chinese President Xi Jinping, who gave his approval for the arrangement. “I told him what we were doing, and he said, ‘Go ahead with it,’” Trump said, adding that TikTok U.S. would be “American operated all the way.”The President also said that the new ownership structure will make sure that the social media platform is not being used as a ‘propaganda tool’.ByteDance has not yet publicly commented on the executive order but previously said it would comply with applicable laws to ensure TikTok remains available to American users.","US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order approving the proposal sale of TikTok’s US operations to an American investor group.

The United States said on Friday that it will revoke the visa of Colombian President Gustavo Petro after he made pro-Palestinian remarks during a demonstration in New York City.The series of remarks included urging US soldiers to disobey orders and accusing US President Donald Trump of being “complicit in genocide” in Gaza.The comments were made while Petro was in New York for the United Nations general assembly. Addressing a crowd outside the UN headquarters, he said, “I ask all the soldiers of the army of the United States not to point their guns at people. Disobey the orders of (President Donald) Trump. Obey the orders of humanity!” quoted news agency Reuters.The US state department, reacting sharply to his remarks, posted on X,“Earlier today, Colombian president @petrogustavo stood on a NYC street and urged U.S. soldiers to disobey orders and incite violence. We will revoke Petro’s visa due to his reckless and incendiary actions.”At the pro-Palestinian demonstration in Times Square, Petro also called for a military response to the ongoing conflict in Gaza, saying, “we have to answer with a war … and we have to answer with weapons. That’s why we need to create an army, bigger than the army of Israel and that of the USA. I do not have anything against you people or the Israeli people, they are my friends.”Petro’s social media accounts later amplified the remarks. On Friday, he reposted videos of his appearances at the protests and shared a message that read, “Free Palestine. If Gaza falls, humanity dies.”In his official address to the UN General Assembly earlier in the week, Petro took direct aim at the US, accusing Trump of complicity in war crimes in Gaza and calling for “criminal proceedings” over American missile strikes on suspected drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean.The remarks - particularly the call for US military personnel to defy orders - triggered an immediate diplomatic response from Washington. While Petro said his comments were directed at governments and not citizens, US officials viewed the language as unacceptable.Tensions between Colombia and the US have been growing in recent months. Petro, a vocal critic of Israel's actions in Gaza, has already suspended Colombian coal exports to Israel.","Colombian President Gustavo Petro made pro-Palestinian remarks during a demonstration in New York City.

Former FBI director and longtime Donald Trump critic James Comey has been indicted on two counts, US media reported Thursday, marking the latest escalation in the president’s campaign of legal action against political adversaries.Comey faces charges of making false statements and obstruction of justice. The indictment follows Trump’s public call earlier this week for Attorney General Pam Bondi to pursue charges against Comey and other officials.""No one is above the law,"" Bondi said on X after the indictment was announced, without naming Comey. ""Today's indictment reflects this Department of Justice's commitment to holding those who abuse positions of power accountable for misleading the American people. We will follow the facts in this case.""The indictment was filed by Lindsey Halligan, a former personal lawyer to Trump who was appointed US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia just days earlier. Halligan has no prior prosecutorial experience. She replaced Erik Siebert, who resigned last week after reportedly telling Justice Department leaders there was insufficient evidence to charge Comey or New York Attorney General Letitia James.James and other Democratic officials have been accused by Trump allies, including Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte, of falsifying mortgage documents.Comey was dismissed by Trump in 2017 during an investigation into possible collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia during the 2016 election. His indictment comes amid a broader crackdown on critics, including former national security advisor John Bolton, whose home and office were raided in August as part of a classified documents probe.Bolton has angered Trump with his memoir,, and frequent public criticism of the president, calling him ""unfit to be president.""Since returning to office in January, Trump has taken punitive steps against perceived opponents, including stripping former officials of security clearances, targeting law firms that handled past cases against him, and cutting federal funding to certain universities.Trump himself has faced multiple investigations. The FBI raided his Mar-a-Lago residence in 2022 over classified documents, and Special Counsel Jack Smith charged him with trying to overturn the 2020 election results. Neither case went to trial, and Smith dropped both after Trump’s victory in the 2024 election, citing Justice Department policy against prosecuting a sitting president.","Former FBI director James Comey indicted on two counts of making false statements and obstruction of justice.

‘There’s no substance; too long’: JD Vance trolls Kamala Harris’ 2024 presidential campaign; claims listening to her made him ‘dumber’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/theres-no-substance-too-long-jd-vance-trolls-kamala-harris-2024-presidential-campaign-claims-listening-to-her-made-him-dumber/articleshow/124175923.cms,"File photo: JD Vance and Kamala Harris (Picture credit: AP)





US Vice President JD Vance delivered a scathing assessment of former Vice President Kamala Harris ’ 2024 presidential campaign, saying listening to her left him feeling “dumber in the process” and calling her political messaging devoid of substance.Speaking with Laura Ingraham on Fox News’ The Ingraham Angle on Friday, Vance responded to Harris’ new memoir, 107 Days, in which she recounts her brief presidential run following Joe Biden’s withdrawal from the 2024 race.Harris reportedly blamed the limited campaign window for her loss, a claim that drew sharp criticism from Vance.“My reaction is if you look at the polling, both the public and the private polling, the problem is not that Kamala’s campaign was too short, it’s that it was too long,” Vance said.“That when people actually listened to what she had to say, her polling went down and down and down. I think that if we had had a 150-day campaign, we probably would have had three additional Republican senators, and Donald Trump would have won by an even bigger landslide. Because the more people know about Kamala Harris, the more they realize there’s no substance there”, he added.Vance contrasted Harris with past Democratic figures, noting that former US presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton could articulate clear viewpoints.“Agree or disagree with Barack Obama or Bill Clinton, they actually had substance. They could actually articulate a viewpoint. I listened to Kamala Harris for 90 seconds, and I actually feel like I’ve gotten dumber in the process, and I have no idea what she actually believes,” he said.The vice president continued, warning that Harris’ challenges would persist unless she learned to clearly develop and communicate a viewpoint. “That’s the problem with Kamala Harris, and it’s gonna continue to be her problem unless she actually learns how to develop a viewpoint, articulate it for the American people. Just say what you actually believe. Don’t do this word salad, talking around in circles. It doesn’t work, and it’s why she didn’t win,” Vance said.Harris’ media tour following the release of 107 Days has reignited debate over her campaign strategy and public speaking style. Critics have noted her tendency to provide vague or convoluted answers during interviews, including a controversial 60 Minutes segment on the Israel-Hamas conflict that required clarification after editing issues, as per the Daily Caller.During the 2024 election, Trump won 312 electoral votes to Harris’ 226 and narrowly missed a majority of the popular vote. Post-election analyses revealed that Harris underperformed in several swing states and counties that previously favoured Biden, highlighting the campaign’s challenges in connecting with voters.",US Vice President JD Vance delivered a scathing assessment of former Vice President Kamala Harris’ 2024 presidential campaign.

A Trump administration official was physically assaulted by a “deranged leftist” inside the United Nations Thursday afternoon during the UN General Assembly, Fox News Digital reported.The official, serving in international relations for the Department of Health and Human Services, was in New York supporting HHS Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr and the department’s leadership team at UNGA.“An HHS official was followed into a bathroom, recorded, physically assaulted and verbally accosted by a deranged leftist at the UN who somehow entered the venue past multiple layers of security,” White House Deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly told Fox News Digital. “Thankfully, the official is safe, and the lunatic was arrested, but this is part of a disturbing and dangerous set of failures by the UN after their sabotage of President Trump ahead of and during his speech. ”Kelly said the US Secret Service will investigate “how this violent protester was admitted into a major national security event.” A source familiar with the matter told Fox News Digital the individual has been charged with assault, aggravated harassment, attempted assault and criminal possession of a weapon.The person was released from custody Friday evening and is expected in court on November 13.“We are outraged that a member of the US delegation was physically assaulted inside of UN Headquarters the afternoon of September 25,” a US UN spokesperson told Fox News Digital. “This attack must be addressed swiftly, and consequences must be felt.” The spokesperson added that the UN “recognizes that it has lost its way” and called the incident “unacceptable.”The official recounted to Fox News Digital that she was walking down a hallway when a woman began yelling derogatory and pro-Palestinian remarks while shining a bright light in her face. “It was very disorienting. Once I took a step back and regained my footing, it didn’t stop. I realized what was happening. I realized I was being yelled at and that the light was also a recording device.”The assailant followed the official into a women’s bathroom, trying to enter a stall and continuing to film while screaming insults. After about 10 minutes, the official managed to escape into the hallway. “It felt very political in nature,” she said. “Secretary Kennedy gets a tremendous number of bows and arrows and threats that he deals with, but it seems that it’s not enough, and it is trickling down. That’s a scary thing for the team. But we’re more empowered, and we have amazing leadership.”Fox News Digital learned the woman was arrested by the New York City Police Department, though her current custody status is unclear. The NYPD and United Nations did not respond to requests for comment.Earlier this week, President Donald Trump highlighted several technical issues during his UN visit, including a stalled escalator, teleprompter failure, and audio problems in the auditorium. Trump called the incidents “triple sabotage” and said he had sent his concerns to the UN Secretary-General, requesting an investigation and security footage review.","The official was in New York supporting HHS Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr. The individual has been charged with assault, aggravated harassment, attempted assault and criminal possession of a weapon.

Fresh details are coming to light about defence secretary Pete Hegseth ’s surprise order requiring hundreds of US generals and admirals to assemble next week in Virginia, with senior officials now describing it as an attempt to showcase the administration’s reinvention of the Pentagon as the “department of war. ”The directive was issued earlier this week to all commanders ranked one-star general or rear admiral and above, along with their senior enlisted leaders. Exceptions will be granted only in rare cases with top-level approval.Staff across the globe have scrambled to arrange urgent travel, with many officers leaving posts in active conflict zones.“It’s meant to be an eyeball-to-eyeball kind of conversation,” one person familiar with the planning was quoted as saying by The Washington Post. ‘He wants to see the generals’, the person added.While the Pentagon has provided no agenda, a senior Trump administration official cited by The New York Times said that the unprecedented gathering, described as without precedent in size and scope, is intended to “get our fighters excited” about Hegseth’s vision for the department.Congressional committees were informed Friday that the secretary would use the forum to outline new fitness standards and other priorities.According to CNN, the event is expected to resemble a “pep rally,” emphasising Hegseth’s drive to rebrand the Pentagon as the “department of war” and restore what he calls a “warrior ethos.”A defence official quoted by the outlet claimed that the meeting is designed as “a showcase for Hegseth to tell them: get on board, or potentially have your career shortened.”The gathering comes after months of turbulence at the Pentagon, where Hegseth has dismissed numerous senior officers, many of them women and people of colour and ordered a 20% cut in four-star generals and admirals, according to CNN.Critics say the moves have created a climate of fear.Hegseth, a former Army officer and Fox News host, has tied his agenda to what he calls a “return to lethality,” though his initiatives have ranged from new shaving standards to banning transgender personnel.The short-notice order has triggered concern over cost and security. With around 800 generals and admirals in the armed forces, including 44 four-stars, the influx of officers and aides could number in the hundreds.One US official was quoted by The Post as saying, “It does have an impact, pulling them all in. Why is it so important to get them all in the room?”Retired Lt Gen Ben Hodges compared the assembly to a 1935 Nazi-era oath ceremony in Germany, prompting Hegseth to respond sarcastically on social media, “Cool story, General.”Congressional Democrats have also raised alarms. Senator Tammy Duckworth began circulating a letter Friday warning of costs, security risks and disruption to operations if so many top officers are brought stateside simultaneously.According to The Times, the meeting will be the first of three speeches, with follow-up lectures planned on the defence industrial base and deterrence. The timing is sensitive: September 30 marks the end of the fiscal year, and a potential government shutdown could complicate travel as US forces face crises in Ukraine, Gaza and the Middle East.Vice President JD Vance has dismissed the controversy, calling the event “not particularly unusual.”","US defence secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered hundreds of US generals and admirals to assemble next week in Virginia.

Watch: ICE officer shoves women to floor at immigration courthouse; agency says 'relieved from current duties',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-ice-officer-shoves-women-to-floor-at-immigration-courthouse-agency-says-relieved-from-current-duties/articleshow/124175755.cms,"



An Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer who shoved a woman into a wall and then pushed her to the ground at a New York City immigration courthouse has been “relieved of his current duties,” an ICE official said Friday, CNN reported.The incident, captured on video Thursday, has drawn widespread outrage as families across the United States continue to face enforcement actions after attending immigration court hearings.“The officer’s conduct in this video is unacceptable and beneath the men and women of ICE,” Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said. “Our ICE law enforcement are held to the highest professional standards and this officer is being relieved of current duties as we conduct a full investigation.”CNN has asked ICE to clarify what “relieved of his current duties” entails and whether the officer remains employed elsewhere in the agency.The woman and her family have open asylum claims, according to the office of U.S. Representative Dan Goldman, whose district includes the courthouse. A spokesperson said the family “are here lawfully but are being targeted by ICE regardless.” Goldman and New York City Comptroller Brad Lander have referred the ICE agent to the U.S.Attorney’s Office for felony prosecution.Video footage shows Monica Moreta-Galarza and her daughter clinging to her husband as he is detained in a hallway of 26 Federal Plaza, the ICE district office in Lower Manhattan. A masked officer grabs Moreta-Galarza by the hair while another voice urges, “Just grab her, grab her and pull her away.”Moments later, she is taken into a nearby room while her children watch. The video resumes with her in the hallway confronting a federal agent in Spanish, saying, “You guys don’t care about anything!” The agent replies, “Adios, adios,” before shoving her down the hallway into a wall and onto the ground. He stands over her and says in Spanish, “Leave!”A spokesperson for New York City Mayor Eric Adams said the city is “less safe when immigrants are afraid to use basic services and attend court hearings,” adding that officials are pleased the incident is being investigated.Goldman and Lander called the officer’s actions “flagrantly egregious conduct” and said they violate the federal code on deprivation of rights under color of law. “In this case, the officer, acting under the color of law, willfully used excessive physical force by throwing a young mother to the ground and thereby deprived the victim of her Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures,” their statement said.New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani also condemned the actions, saying, “We knew that that act is taking place every day across this country, oftentimes unseen, unnoticed and unabashed in its cruelty. It’s important that we describe it, that we stand up to it.”Moreta-Galarza, who fled violence in Ecuador, was taken to a hospital for possible head trauma, according to Goldman’s office. The family plans to sue ICE for excessive use of force, and her husband has been transferred to a detention center in New Jersey, with his status currently unknown.The incident has renewed criticism of ICE courthouse arrests, with advocates calling for an end to detentions in and around court facilities. Jorge Torres, organizing director of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, said, “They trap and deport our neighbors when they are simply abiding by the rules to show up for their hearings. We demand ICE out of the courts — no arrests in or around our courthouses.”","ICE officer who shoved a woman into a wall and then pushed her to the ground is fired.

US President Donald Trump said Friday that negotiations on Gaza were “very inspired and productive,” while reports emerged that his administration has tabled a detailed proposal calling for the release of hostages and withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Strip.“I am pleased to report that we are having very inspired and productive discussions with the Middle Eastern Community concerning Gaza,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Intense negotiations have been going on for four days, and will continue for as long as necessary in order to get a Successfully Completed Agreement.”He said “all of the Countries within the Region are involved,” adding that Hamas was aware of the discussions and that Israel had been kept informed “at all levels, including Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu.” Trump also claimed there was more “Goodwill and Enthusiasm for getting a Deal done, after so many decades, than I have ever seen before,” calling the talks an effort to move past a “period of Death and Darkness.” He concluded: “We must get the Hostages back, and get a PERMANENT AND LONGLASTING PEACE!”The comments came as CNN reported that the Trump administration has circulated a 21-point peace plan. According to a source familiar with the proposal, the plan calls for the release of the 48 remaining hostages within two days of an agreement, in exchange for the withdrawal of Israeli Defense Forces from Gaza. The timeline for withdrawal was not specified, and it was unclear whether Hamas had been formally presented with the proposal.The proposal reportedly states that Hamas cannot play any governing role in Gaza.Instead, two interim layers of governance are suggested: an international body and a Palestinian committee. Arab leaders were briefed earlier this week and expressed broad support, telling CNN they did not see the plan as perfect but wanted “an end to the conflict as quickly as possible.”Saudi broadcaster Al-Hadath reported additional provisions, including amnesty for Hamas members in exchange for leaving Gaza and surrendering weapons. It said Israel would free between 100 and 200 Palestinian prisoners in return for the hostages. The plan also outlines a five-year international reconstruction initiative for Gaza and the creation of a Palestinian security force under Arab and international oversight.Both CNN and Al-Hadath noted that the plan may be undergoing revisions. One reported element under review by Qatari officials would prohibit Israel from striking Qatar in the future. Other details cited include a ban on forced displacement of Palestinians and the possible closure of the Gaza Humanitarian Fund.Earlier on Friday, Trump had told reporters before departing for the Ryder Cup golf tournament in New York that a ceasefire-hostage agreement was “very close.” Netanyahu, however, told the UN General Assembly the same day that Israel would continue military operations until Hamas disarms.","CNN reports that the Trump administration has circulated a 21-point peace plan.

Black lives matter fallout: FBI agents photographed kneeling during 2020 George Floyd protests fired; report says about 20 dismissed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/black-lives-matter-fallout-fbi-agents-photographed-kneeling-during-2020-george-floyd-protests-fired-report-says-about-20-dismissed/articleshow/124174879.cms,"



The FBI has dismissed agents who were photographed kneeling during racial justice demonstrations in Washington following the 2020 killing of George Floyd, according to three people familiar with the matter, the associated press reported.The bureau had reassigned the agents last spring but has since terminated their employment, the people said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters. The exact number of firings was not clear, but two of the people estimated it to be about 20.Images from the protests showed FBI employees kneeling in apparent solidarity during nationwide demonstrations after Floyd’s death at the hands of Minneapolis police officers. The killing, captured on video, triggered a national reckoning over policing and racial injustice.Meanwhile there is no official comment from FBI.The firings come as Director Kash Patel leads a broader personnel shake-up at the bureau. At least five agents and top-level executives were dismissed last month in what current and former officials describe as a wave of ousters that has lowered morale.Among those removed was Steve Jensen, who helped oversee investigations into the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot.Another, Brian Driscoll, served as acting FBI director in the early Trump administration and resisted Justice Department efforts to obtain names of agents involved in January 6 investigations. Chris Meyer, who was falsely linked online to the probe into Trump’s handling of classified documents, and Walter Giardina, who took part in high-profile cases such as the investigation of Trump adviser Peter Navarro, were also dismissed.In a lawsuit, Jensen, Driscoll and former FBI supervisor Spencer Evans alleged that Patel acknowledged he understood it was “likely illegal” to fire agents based on the cases they handled but said he was powerless to stop the removals because the White House and Justice Department were determined to eliminate those who had investigated Trump.Patel, testifying before Congress last week, denied receiving direction from the White House on personnel decisions and insisted that those dismissed “failed to meet the FBI’s standards.”(With inputs from AP)","The FBI had reassigned the agents last spring but has since terminated their employment.

"Drone attack in Haiti slum kills 8 children: Residents blame police for strike; UN-backed mission still short on manpower, funding",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/drone-attack-in-haiti-slum-kills-8-children-residents-blame-police-for-strike-un-backed-mission-still-short-on-manpower-funding/articleshow/124059212.cms,"



A drone attack targeting a suspected gang leader killed at least eight children and injured six others in Cité Soleil, a gang-controlled slum of Haiti’s capital, relatives and activists told The Associated Press on Monday. They blamed police for launching the strike on Saturday night.The explosions struck during a gathering reportedly organised by suspected gang leader Albert Steevenson, known as Djouma, who was preparing to celebrate his birthday. Haiti’s National Human Rights Defense Network said Steevenson was distributing gifts to children at the time.“This is my daughter,” said Claudia Bobrun, 30, showing AP a video of her 8-year-old girl lying in a pool of blood. Tears rolled down her face as she replayed the clip.Residents said at least 13 people died, including civilians and suspected gang members. Victims included the two grandchildren and son of 60-year-old Michelis Florville. “People were running right and left,” he recalled.Nanouse Mertelia, 37, said her son was killed after being caught in the blast. “Come get me, come get me, please mama,” she quoted him as saying before he died from blood loss.The rights group accused police of using two kamikaze drones in the Simon Pelé community of Cité Soleil. Activists added that a similar drone operation in downtown Port-au-Prince earlier this month killed at least eleven civilians.“However, the drones have not targeted terrorist leaders.

The government has confirmed it is working with foreign contractors but has not disclosed the terms of the deal.Meanwhile, the UN-backed multinational mission in Haiti continues to face resource shortages, with just 991 personnel deployed against a target of 2,500, and funding standing at $112 million of the $800 million required annually, according to a recent UN report.","The explosions struck during a gathering reportedly organised by suspected gang leader Albert Steevenson, known as Djouma.

Ex-FBI Chief James Comey Lambasts US President’s ‘Secret’ After Being Indicted | Watch





Former US Vice President Kamala Harris has sharply criticised the federal indictment of former FBI director James Comey, warning that it reflects President Donald Trump ’s drive to punish his political enemies.Speaking exclusively to CNN during a stop on her book tour in Washington, Harris said she was dismayed by the charges filed against Comey.“It’s frustrating, but more than that, it’s painful to see,” she said. “I mean what’s happening with Comey: Are you f***ing kidding me? The United States Department of Justice?”Comey was indicted late Thursday on charges of obstruction and perjury linked to his testimony during a 2020 Senate hearing on Trump’s 2016 campaign’s alleged ties with Russia.He is the first senior official connected to the Russia inquiry to face prosecution, according to news agency AP Trump, who has long derided the Russia investigation as a “witch hunt” and a “hoax,” has repeatedly demanded charges against Comey.Just days before the indictment, he posted on Truth Social, urging attorney general Pam Bondi to act, writing, “We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility… JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!”.Harris, a former California attorney general and prosecutor, said she had warned during her 2024 presidential campaign that Trump would use his second term to go after opponents.“He said it; we knew he would do it,” she said, as per CNN.“But it is every day unrelenting.”She added that Trump’s Truth Social post directed at “Pam” suggested his intent was clear, even if it appeared to be a direct order.She argued that Trump had previously identified “the enemy within” as anyone who did not support him, including journalists, judges, and election officials.“We know who he would target, because he has attacked them before,” she had said on the campaign trail.Comey’s prosecution has raised alarm among Democrats and legal experts. Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Dick Durbin said on Friday that “the department of justice has become a political tool of a vengeful president,” according to The Hill.The case against Comey, launched days after Trump’s public pressure on Bondi, has added to concerns that the justice department is being weaponised under Trump’s leadership.",Kamala Harris says she is dismayed by the charges filed against James Comey.

‘A monster’: Arizona man convicted of killing eight in deadly 2017 spree; motive still unclear,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/a-monster-arizona-man-convicted-of-killing-eight-in-deadly-2017-spree-motive-still-unclear/articleshow/124173096.cms,"AP file photo





An Arizona jury on Thursday found Cleophus Cooksey Jr. guilty of murdering eight people in 2017, concluding three days of deliberations in a case that marks him as one of the state’s most prolific serial killers.Prosecutors said Cooksey carried out a three-week shooting spree that claimed the lives of both random victims and his own mother and stepfather. The killings occurred during a period of heightened anxiety in metro Phoenix, where residents were still unsettled by two separate serial shooting cases in 2015 that left many fearful of venturing out at night or driving on freeways.Cooksey, 43, faces the death penalty following convictions for murder, as well as charges of kidnapping, sexual assault, and armed robbery in a months-long trial.His victims in Phoenix and nearby Glendale included two men found dead in a parked car, a security guard shot while walking to his girlfriend’s apartment, and a woman who was kidnapped and later discovered in an alley after being sexually assaulted.An aspiring musician, Cooksey, was acquainted with some of the victims but not others, and authorities have not identified a motive.Police arrested Cooksey in December 2017 after responding to a call at his mother’s home.According to authorities, Cooksey answered the door with blood on his hands and became agitated, shouting, “It’s me, Trump! It’s me, Trump!” while claiming he worked for the FBI, as cited by USA Today.Officers used a stun gun to restrain him. Inside the home, police discovered blood on the walls and floor, as well as the bodies of his mother, Renee Cooksey, and stepfather, Edward Nunn.A friend of Cooksey’s mother and stepfather said the defendant deserved the death penalty. Eric Hampton, who watched Cooksey grow up, attended Thursday’s hearing to see if he showed any remorse for his victims.""I thought maybe he had a little heart. But he doesn't have any heart at all, you know, to actually do these things to people and actually the worst part, kill your own mom,"" Hampton was quoted as saying by CBS News.""He's a monster, and I'm just hoping that when the sentencing phase of this is over that, you know, that they put him to sleep,"" he added.","Cleophus Cooksey Jr. faces the death penalty following convictions for murder, as well as charges of kidnapping, sexual assault, and armed robbery.

Leaked Epstein Documents Hint at Elite Ties; What’s Inside Has Lawmakers Sounding the Alarm | WATCH





Tech billionaire Elon Musk ’s name has appeared in the highly controversial Jeffrey Epstein files, along with other well-known figures like Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, Trump ally Steve Bannon, and Peter Thiel.On Friday, Democratic lawmakers released documents from the investigation into Epstein. These papers may show interactions between the disgraced financier and prominent conservatives, including Elon Musk, Steve Bannon, and Peter Thiel.The six pages of documents, released with redactions, come from the batch given by the Justice Department to the House Oversight Committee. The committee is investigating how the sex-trafficking charges against Epstein, who died in federal custody in 2019, were handled.Epstein’s calendars, released by the committee’s Democratic minority, show a breakfast planned with Bannon, a close ally of Donald Trump , in February 2019. Other schedules mention a lunch with Thiel in November 2017 and a potential visit by Musk to Epstein’s private island in December 2014.The documents show Musk as a possible visitor to Epstein's island, Little St James, on December 6, 2014—six years after Epstein had already been listed as a sex offender.A 2000 manifest for Epstein’s plane includes Prince Andrew, whose links with Epstein are already well known. A financial disclosure released by Democrats also shows Epstein paying someone named “Andrew” for “Massage, Exercise, Yoga” that same year.Earlier this year, Musk accused Trump on social media of being in the “Epstein files,” shortly after criticising his tax and spending policies and following his long hobnobbing with Trump and the DOGE exit from the administration.Then in July, Musk said publicly: “How can people be expected to have faith in Trump if he won’t release the Epstein files?”","Democratic lawmakers released documents from the investigation into Epstein.

The US Supreme Court on Friday sided with President Trump , allowing his administration to withhold roughly $4 billion in foreign aid approved by Congress for the current fiscal year, granting emergency relief in line with his ""America First"" agenda.The Supreme Court’s ruling follows an earlier order by Chief Justice John Roberts that temporarily blocked a lower court injunction requiring the Trump administration to spend Congress-approved foreign aid by the end of September.The court appeared to split 6-3, with Justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor, and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissenting.The liberal justices argued that Friday’s ruling undermines the constitutional principle of separation of powers among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. They emphasized that the US Constitution ""gives Congress the power to make spending decisions through the enactment of appropriations laws,"" as cited by Reuters.In an unsigned order, the court said the potential harm to the executive branch’s ability to manage foreign affairs outweighs the possible impact on the plaintiffs, who are organizations and businesses receiving foreign aid funding, as reported by CBS News.It added that it, ""should not be read as a final determination on the merits. The relief granted by the Court today reflects our preliminary view, consistent with the standards for interim relief.""Trump has also taken steps to dismantle the US Agency for International Development, the primary agency responsible for American foreign aid.The US government's 2025 fiscal year ends on September 30. The $4 billion in aid at the center of the dispute was allocated by Congress for foreign aid, United Nations peacekeeping, and democracy-promotion programs abroad, as reported by Reuters.Last year, Congress budgeted billions in foreign aid, including roughly $11 billion set to expire at the end of the fiscal year. The Trump administration sought to block the $4 billion through a “pocket rescission,” an unusual tactic intended to avoid spending funds appropriated by Congress, which holds the constitutional power of the purse.The Trump administration last month had asked the Supreme Court to intervene in a legal dispute over foreign aid, arguing that without action, it would be forced to release billions of dollars, undermining its foreign-policy decisions.In an emergency appeal, the Justice Department requested that the justices block a lower court order requiring the government to commit roughly $12 billion in aid before the fiscal year ends on September 30, according to CNN.Trump’s budget director, Russell Vought, argued that the president can withhold funds for 45 days after requesting a rescission, effectively delaying spending until the fiscal year ends.The White House noted that this approach was last employed in 1977. Some legal experts have said that Trump’s attempt to reclaim billions in congressionally approved funds in this manner is unprecedented, as cited by Reuters.","The US Supreme Court on Friday sided with President Trump, allowing his administration to withhold roughly $4 billion in foreign aid.

US President Donald Trump announced plans to declassify and release all government records related to aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart, including documents concerning her final, fatal flight.“I have been asked by many people about the life and times of Amelia Earhart, such an interesting story, and would I consider declassifying and releasing everything about her, in particular, her last, fatal flight!” he said through a post on Truth Social.Trump noted in his post that Earhart was the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean, achieved numerous aviation “firsts” before disappearing in the South Pacific while attempting to become the first woman to fly around the world. She completed nearly three-quarters of the journey before vanishing without a trace nearly 90 years ago, an event that “captivated millions.”He directed his administration to make all related government records public.“Her disappearance, almost 90 years ago, has captivated millions. I am ordering my Administration to declassify and release all Government Records related to Amelia Earhart, her final trip, and everything else about her,” Trump said.Her stepson, George Palmer Putnam Jr, told the Palm Beach Post in 2011 that he believes “the plane just ran out of gas.”Other theories suggest that Earhart and Noonan may have been captured by Japanese forces or crash-landed on a different island, but neither the aircraft nor their remains have ever been found, as cited by The Independent.It remains unclear what government records on Earhart might still exist nearly 100 years later or why any such documents would remain classified.The president’s announcement coincides with a bipartisan group of House members preparing to push for a vote on legislation that would require the Department of Justice to release case files related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein",US President Donald Trump announced plans to declassify and release all government records related to aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart.

Documents from Jeffrey Epstein ’s estate, provided to Democratic lawmakers investigating his network of powerful political connections, indicate possible contact between Epstein and Elon Musk as well as Steve Bannon.The newly released files suggest that in the final years of his life, the convicted sex offender maintained ties with Musk, a former adviser to US President Donald Trump.Among the more than 8,500 documents turned over by Epstein’s estate to Democratic members of the House Oversight Committee, roughly six pages outline meeting schedules that appear to include appointments with Steve Bannon and venture capitalist Peter Thiel during Donald Trump’s first term.According to what appears to be a copy of Epstein’s itinerary, Musk was tentatively scheduled for a trip to Epstein’s island on December 6, 2014. A note attached to the plan asked, “is this still happening?” At the time, Epstein owned a private island in the US Virgin Islands.Musk’s name appearing in the files is noteworthy, as the billionaire clashed with Trump over their release, fueling a public rift that led to allegations Trump was involved in a cover-up to block their disclosure.“How can people be expected to have faith in Trump if he won’t release the Epstein files?” Musk said through a post on X earlier.“It should be clear to every American that Jeffrey Epstein was friends with some of the most powerful and wealthiest men in the world,” said Sara Guerrero, a spokesperson for Oversight Democrats, as reported by Politico.“Every new document produced provides new information as we work to bring justice for the survivors and victims,” she added.The newly released files are significant because they indicate that all three influential figures maintained ties with Epstein even after his controversial plea deal requiring him to register as a sex offender.The documents also include a May 12, 2000, flight manifest listing Prince Andrew as a passenger alongside Jeffrey Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell on a trip from New Jersey to West Palm Beach, Florida. The same email references a tentative breakfast meeting with Bill Gates.A GOP spokesperson for the Oversight Committee criticized Democrats for releasing the documents on their own.“It’s unfortunate that Democrats continue to meaninglessly cherry-pick documents and politicize this investigation,” the spokesperson said. “They are intentionally withholding documents that contain names of Democrat officials, and the information they released today is old news.”The documents from Epstein’s estate include previously released phone message logs, flight records from 1990 to 2019, and ledgers of cash transactions and schedules from 2010 to 2019.The latest batch of documents comes after extensive two-day congressional hearings with FBI Director Kash Patel, whose leadership has faced scrutiny following the bureau’s earlier decision that “no further disclosure” in the Epstein case “would be appropriate or warranted,"" as cited by the Independent.","Documents from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate, provided to Democratic lawmakers, indicate possible contact between Epstein and Elon Musk as well as Steve Bannon.

US President Donald Trump is expected to meet Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif at the White House on Thursday, a Trump administration official told Reuters on Wednesday.The meeting comes weeks after the two countries agreed to a trade deal and follows a brief encounter between the leaders at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.US-Pakistan ties have warmed in recent months under Trump, even as Washington’s relations with New Delhi have been tested over issues such as visa hurdles, high tariffs imposed on Indian goods, and Trump’s repeated claims that he brokered an India-Pakistan ceasefire in May.The United States and Pakistan announced a trade deal on July 31, including a 19% tariff rate imposed by Washington.However, US has yet to reach a similar trade agreement with India.Donald Trump previously hosted Pakistani army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir at the White House, marking the first time a US president met the head of Pakistan’s army without senior civilian officials. “We're working through a number of issues when it comes to counter-terrorism, when it comes to economic and trade ties,” a senior State Department official said. “And so the president remains focused on advancing US interests in the region, that includes through engaging with Pakistan and their government leaders.Asked about frictions with India, the official told Reuters, “Trump believed in being frank about frustrations in ties but the relationship was strong. Washington viewed New Delhi as a good friend and partner and believed their relationship would define the 21st century.” The official added that planning continues for a summit of the Quad grouping of India, Australia, Japan and the United States, expected either later this year or early next year.Sharif also met Trump on Tuesday on the sidelines of the UNGA in a meeting hosted alongside Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, attended by leaders from Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Egypt, the UAE, and Jordan.

At least 12 people, including women and children, were injured in a bombing attack on the Quetta-bound Jaffar Express in Pakistan’s Balochistan province — the latest in a string of attacks on the train since March.Officials said the blast struck the passenger train as it passed through the Spizend area of Mastung district, causing six carriages to derail and one to overturn on Tuesday. Around 270 people were on board. Security forces rushed to the site and evacuated the injured to a nearby hospital, PTI reported.It was the second explosion in the area within 10 hours. Earlier that morning, an IED went off near the main track linking Balochistan to the rest of the country just as the Peshawar-bound Jaffar Express was preparing to leave Quetta station. That train was cleared to continue because the rails were undamaged.The Jaffar Express, which runs between Quetta and Peshawar, has repeatedly been targeted by separatist groups. On August 10, an IED derailed six coaches of the Peshawar-bound train, injuring four passengers. On August 7, a bomb near Sibi station exploded moments after the train passed; and on August 4 gunmen opened fire on its pilot engine near Kolpur, an attack later claimed by the Baloch Liberation Army.Earlier incidents this year include a remotely controlled blast in June that derailed four carriages in Jacobabad and a March hijacking in Bolan that killed 21 passengers and four security personnel before security forces killed 33 suspected militants in a follow-up operation.Rail officials said repairs to the damaged section of track would begin Wednesday under security clearance, with services temporarily suspended.","The Jaffar Express, which runs between Quetta and Peshawar, has repeatedly been targeted by separatist groups.

A key protest leader had previously demanded arrests of Oli and his home minister, Ramesh Lekhak, for allegedly giving orders to use live ammunition on the demonstrators. He did not provide evidence. Oli had said in a Sept 20 Facebook post his govt had not ordered security forces to fire at protesters and urged an investigation ""into the incidents in which shots were fired from automatic weapons that are not in police possession"".A spokesperson for Kathmandu District Office, said he had no knowledge about the use of live ammunition.(This is a Reuters story)","At least 33 of the demonstrators killed during anti-corruption protests in Nepal this month were struck by ""live bullets"" fired from ""high-velocity firearms"", the medical institute that conducted the postmortem examinations said.

Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was confronted by (Asian News International) regarding cross-border terrorism just before his speech at the United Nations on Friday.Shehbaz Sharif arrived at the United Nations headquarters on Friday to attend the fourth day of speeches at the UN General Debate.As he entered the venue, ANI asked the Pakistan Prime Minister, ""When are you going to stop cross-border terrorism?"" In response, Sharif said, ""We are defeating cross-border terrorism. We are defeating them."" ANI further pressed him, remarking, ""India is defeating you, Pakistan Prime Minister.""He didn't respond to ANI's remarks and went ahead to attend the 80th session of the UNGA.Operation Sindoor was a significant military operation launched by India on May 7, 2025, in response to the Pahalgam terrorist attack on April 22, 2025 which killed 26 civilians, including a Nepali national.The operation involved coordinated air and missile strikes targeting nine locations in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) through precision strikes in May this year, repelled subsequent escalation by Pakistan, and pounded its airbases.India's response was described as measured, non-escalatory, and focused on terror infrastructure, avoiding civilian and military targets.India agreed to the cessation of hostilities after Pakistan's Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) called his Indian counterpart.Meanwhile, ahead of his scheduled meeting with Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal, US President Donald Trump addressed reporters from the Oval Office, saying, ""they're coming, and they may be in this room right now. I don't know, because we're late.""""We have a great leader coming, the Prime Minister of Pakistan and the Field Marshal. Field Marshal is a very great guy, and so is the Prime Minister, both, and they're coming, and they may be in this room right now,"" Trump said.According to the White House's public schedule, Trump is set to engage in a closed-door session with Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in the Oval Office.On September 23, Sharif also had an informal exchange with Trump following a meeting between the US President and leaders of eight Islamic-Arab countries, which also included Pakistan.""Informal exchange followed the dialogue between President Trump and leaders of eight Islamic-Arab countries, including Pakistan. Prime Minister Shehbaz and Deputy Prime Minister/Foreign Minister Senator Ishaq Dar joined President Donald Trump in the discussion,"" the Pakistan foreign minister stated in a post on X.After years of strained relations, US-Pakistan ties began warming when Islamabad credited US President Donald Trump for his so-called peace intervention during the military conflict with India in May.Trump claimed he helped broker a ceasefire between the two nuclear-armed neighbours, using trade and tariff threats--a claim that India has firmly denied.Initially, Pakistan's military leadership stated that the ceasefire was initiated following a direct proposal from its Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) to his Indian counterpart. However, Islamabad later shifted its stance, attributing the breakthrough to Washington's efforts, even going so far as to nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize.","Shehbaz Sharif arrived at the United Nations headquarters on Friday to attend the fourth day of speeches at the UN General Debate.

Bangladesh EC's refusal to grant demanded symbol angers student-led NCP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-ecs-refusal-to-grant-demanded-symbol-angers-student-led-ncp/articleshow/124102646.cms,"Representative image





DHAKA: Bangladesh's student-led National Citizen Party (NCP) threatens to halt elections after the Election Commission (EC) refused to allocate the symbol it demanded ahead of the February polls.NCP, a large offshoot of Students against Discrimination (SAD), which led last year's street campaign dubbed as the July Uprising, toppling then prime minister Sheikh Hasina's Awami League and installing professor Muhammad Yunus as the chief adviser.""The commission could not show any legal logic for not allocating the 'shapla' (water lily) as our symbol and therefore we are sticking to our demand,"" NCP's convenor Nahid Islam was quoted as saying on Wednesday by newspapers a day after the EC revealed its decision on the issue.Islam said NCP would give its ""final reaction"" once the EC takes its ""formal decision"".However, the party's chief coordinator for northern Bangladesh, Sarjis Alam, threatened to halt the polls unless their demand was met.""Since there is no legal barrier, the NCP must get the 'shapla' as its symbol; there is no other option. Unless we get it, we will see how the election is held and how someone could dream of attaining power,"" Alam posted on social media.EC's senior secretary, Akhter Ahmed, on Tuesday told a media briefing that NCP would not be allotted the symbol they demanded as it is ""not included in the list of electoral symbols as per the regulations"".""The 'shapla' is not on our list of 115 electoral symbols. According to the rules, political parties must choose a symbol from the approved list,"" he said.The ""shapla"" is the national emblem of Bangladesh.NCP chief coordinator Nasiruddin Patwary led the party delegation to the EC to get its registration earlier and said the party must be registered with the ""shapla"" symbol.Asked how they would secure the symbol since it was not included in the EC's revised list, he said amendments could be made at any time.Patwary also said the party expected to win around 150 constituencies out of 300, with nominations including former army officers, as well as women, farmers, and workers involved in the July uprising.Several political analysts, however, speculate a bleak fate for NCP in elections, particularly after their nominees witnessed a landslide defeat in students' union elections in two major public universities - the premier Dhaka University and suburban Jahangirnagar University.Bangladesh's largest Islamist Party, Jamaat-e-Islami-backed Islami Chhaita Shibir, won in most of the posts in both elections. Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal, the student wing of former prime minister Khaleda Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party, also witnessed an astounding defeat, though it emerged as the second biggest student group in the central students union polls in the two universities.","Bangladesh's student-led National Citizen Party (NCP) threatens to halt elections.
