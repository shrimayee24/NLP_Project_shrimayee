Delhi CM Atishi urges LG to stop temple demolitions; Saxena's office calls it 'cheap politics',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-cm-atishi-urges-lg-to-stop-temple-demolitions-saxenas-office-calls-it-cheap-politics/articleshow/116835842.cms,"'Cheap politics': LG's secretariat dismisses allegations

Political tensions rise ahead of Delhi polls

NEW DELHI: Delhi chief minister Atishi on Tuesday raised concerns over the order for the demolition of multiple religious structures in the city, and urged Lieutenant Governor Vinai Kumar Saxena to reconsider the orders. In a letter addressed to Saxena, Atishi said that the Religious Committee had decided to demolish several temples and Buddhist structures across Delhi, including those held dear by the Dalit community.Atishi wrote, ""It has been decided by the Religious Committee - on your directions, and with your approval - to demolish multiple religious structures across Delhi.As you can see the list of religious structures to be demolished includes many temples, and Buddhist places of worship that are revered by the Dalit community.""The Delhi CM said that the demolition orders, issued in a meeting held on November 22, 2024, were bypassing the Delhi government’s involvement, with all decisions now routed through the Lieutenant Governor’s office.She added that, given the elected government's role in protecting the religious sentiments of Delhi’s people, such decisions should not be taken without consultation. “On behalf of the people of Delhi, I request you not to demolish any of these temples and places of worship,” she wrote.In response to Atishi’s letter, the Lieutenant Governor’s office rejected the claims, asserting that no temples or places of worship were being demolished. A spokesperson from the LG Secretariat said, ""Neither any Temples, Mosques, Churches or any other place of worship being broken/demolished, nor has any file to this effect come. CM is playing cheap politics to divert attention from her and her predecessor CM's failures.""The statement further added that the Lieutenant Governor had issued strict instructions to the police to maintain extra vigilance to prevent any politically motivated vandalism, citing the smooth celebrations during Christmas as evidence of the policy’s success.""LG has issued strict instructions to the Police to maintain extra vigil against forces who may indulge in deliberate vandalism for political benefits. His instructions are being strictly followed, as was witnessed during the just gone Christmas celebrations which did not see any untoward incident,"" the statement added.The latest exchange of letters comes amid growing political tensions between Atishi and the Lieutenant Governor. Earlier, in a separate letter, Atishi had criticised the LG’s office for acting as a proxy for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Delhi. She accused Saxena of undermining the Aam Aadmi Party ’s (AAP) government by interfering in key initiatives, particularly schemes aimed at empoweringwomen.Atishi’s comments followed an earlier dispute with the LG’s office over Arvind Kejriwal’s remark referring to Atishi as a ""temporary CM."" Saxena had expressed his disapproval of the statement, calling it an affront to constitutional values. Atishi responded by saying that all elected officials, including her, were temporary by nature and should not be subject to petty political criticism.","Delhi chief minister Atishi has raised concerns over the order for the demolition of multiple religious structures in the city.

NEW DELHI: Manipur chief minister N Biren Singh on Tuesday expressed regret over the ongoing crisis in the state, and offered an apology to the people of Manipur for the turmoil that has plagued the region since May 2023.Reflecting on the events of the past year, the Manipur CM said, ""This entire year has been very unfortunate. I feel regret and I want to say sorry to the people of the state for what is happening till today, since last May 3.Many people lost their loved ones. Many people left their homes. I really feel regret.""Singh said that he hopes that following the peace in the last 3-4 months, normalcy will be restored in the state in 2025. He further appealed to the various communities in the state to ""forget past mistakes and start a new life"".""Now, I hope after seeing the last 3-4 months' progress towards peace, I hope that with the New Year 2025, normalcy and peace will be restored in the state. I want to appeal to all the communities of the state that whatever happened has happened. We now have to forget past mistakes and have to start a new life,"" he told news agency ANI.The violence that erupted in May 2023, driven by ethnic tensions between the Meitei community in the valley and the Kuki-Zo tribes in the hills, led to widespread unrest, displacement, and loss of life. The conflict, which deepened throughout 2024, saw over 250 fatalities and thousands rendered homeless, with reports of gunfights, arson, and even drone strikes targeting civilian areas.Singh revealed that the number of firing incidents has significantly reduced over the last several months, dropping from 408 between May and October 2023 to 112 in the past few months. ""I want to apologise for what happened in Manipur, many lost dear ones, many left their homes,"" he said.The violence began with an attack on villagers in January and escalated during the general elections in April, marked by intimidation and widespread violence. The crisis reached new heights in June with a series of killings in Jiribam, a district bordering Assam, sparking further ethnic violence. As tensions mounted, a series of bombings and rocket attacks targeted civilian areas, leaving communities fearful and divided.The chief minister's apology comes as the government looks to the new year with hope for peace. Singh urged all communities to move beyond the past, stressing that only through unity can Manipur hope to heal. ""A peaceful Manipur, a prosperous Manipur, we should all live together,"" he said."," Manipur chief minister N Biren Singh expressed regret over the ongoing crisis in the state.

A carcass of a stray cow could be seen next to him, but it is unclear whether he had killed that animal.SP (Moradabad city) Ran Vijay Singh said, ""Locals came to know of a bovine being slaughtered, and caught one person while his accomplices fled.

"Mumbai fog spreads to sea, pushes fish to warmer waters 200km away",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mumbai-fog-spreads-to-sea-pushes-fish-to-warmer-waters-200km-away/articleshow/116840374.cms,"MUMBAI: Kashinath Bhoir has not returned to the Versova jetty for a week: he and numerous other fishermen have ventured almost 100 nautical miles (around 185km) into the sea to secure their catch. Dnyanesh, his brother, says the fog that blanketed a vast expanse of Arabian sea off Mumbai's coast last week has made the fish move out of its usual 15-20 nautical mile range near the coast towards warmer waters.A Met official said easterly winds have propelled the haze from Mumbai towards the sea. It currently extends 40-50 nautical miles offshore, diminishing visibility to 2 km for fishing vessels .According to fishermen association head Devendra Tandel and Rajhans Tapke, fishing boats and trawlers are now compelled to use up substantial stocks of fuel to venture up to 100 nautical miles (India's territorial waters extend up to 200 nautical miles). As fish migrate towards warmer waters, the catch is dwindling and prices escalating in the city's markets.Fluctuating weather patterns have altered fish migration routes, with Bombay duck, typically caught near Versova, now found beyond Palghar towards Gujarat. Similarly, sardines have shifted northward from the Konkan towards south of Mumbai, they said, highlighting that these alterations in patterns are directly related to weather conditions. According to Tandel, pomfrets have travelled far beyond Mumbai waters.Tapke observed that the recent collision between a fishing vessel and a cargo ship occurred due to poor visibility caused by the dense smog near the coast. Explaining the weather phenomenon, Kamble said the easterly wind travelling towards the western coast is carrying dust and pollutants from various parts of the state, pushing the smog over the Mumbai region further into the sea. ""This time it is not Mumbai's pollution alone, but from other surrounding urban setups as the wind is blowing from the countryside towards the coast,"" he said. It may be noted that the extended smog over Mumbai is primarily due to the substantial moisture that flowed in with the interaction of easterly, northerly and westerly winds over Maharashtra leading to condensation.The initial foggy condition which was due to a drop in temperature thus transformed into widespread smog over the past few days as the heavy moisture and insufficient wind speed forced the dust and smoke from vehicles, garbage and construction sites to remain suspended in air. Since Monday, however, the smog has been rapidly dissipating.Tandel, who is chief of All Maharashtra Fishermen's Action Committee, said the cost of fuel and ice for cold storage, rationing and maintenance of a vessel has increased substantially over the last week, leading to rise in prices of fish. He said since the boats were arriving late, it has also resulted in shortage. ""The cost of Bombay duck has increased more than double while pomfrets and surmai are 30-35% more expensive. If the same weather continues, the rise could be more,"" Tapke added.","Fishing boats and trawlers are now compelled to use up substantial stocks of fuel to venture up to 100 nautical miles.

BATHINDA: A nine-hour shutdown called by farmers' unions fighting for a legally guaranteed minimum support price mechanism for crops struck Punjab off the transport map Monday, with buses going off the road and 150-odd trains passing through or originating in the state either cancelled or curtailed.Thousands of stranded passengers spent the day at railway stations without functioning food stalls, while those who picked alternative transport ran into roadblocks at various places.SKM (non-political) and KMM had called for a shutdown of rail and road traffic from 7am to 4pm, barring even supply of milk and vegetables. Emergency services were exempted.Altercations between protesters and travellers inconvenienced by the strike were reported at some locations. A cancer patient from Gujarat and his wife were stranded at Ferozepur railway station en route Dharamshala in Himachal. The man's wife said she didn't find an eatery or a stall open to buy food, let alone give her husband the diet he has been medically advised to follow.In Faridkot, protesters allegedly abused and threatened primary block education officer Jagtar Singh for keeping his office open.Farm activist Sarvan Singh Pandher said organisations enforcing the strike had sought public support and people of the state spontaneously responded to it, making the bandh ""complete and peaceful"".Fellow activists Kaka Singh Kotda and Surjit Singh Phool said senior members of the farm lobby stayed put at Khanauri border protest site on Punjab-Haryana border as they were worried about safety of fasting farmer Jagjit Singh Dallewal.Punjab administration made another futile attempt at convincing the farmer to receive medical assistance ahead of Tuesday's scheduled hearing on the matter.Retired additional DGP Jaskaran Singh, accompanied by DIG (Patiala range) Mandeep Singh Sidhu and Patiala SSP Nanak Singh, held a series of meetings with farm activists at Khanauri since Sunday. Jaskaran Singh also met Dallewal. The latter only agreed to give blood samples for testing.In a short video after the strike ended, Dallewal thanked people of Punjab for backing the bandh. He also expressed gratitude to the volunteers by his side.Amid calls for unity till farm unions' demands are accepted, rival factions announced parallel kisan mahapanchayats on Jan 4 at two venues 27km apart. The events underscore the rift that some farm activists fear has weakened the movement that gained nationwide traction in 2020-21.SKM plans to hold its mahapanchayat at Tohana in Haryana, while the other two groups, SKM (non-Political) and KMM, will gather at Khanauri. Dallewal is expected to address the second event.",Farmers' unions called for nine-hour shutdown of rail and road traffic from 7am to 4pm. 150-odd trains passing through or originating in the state either cancelled or curtailed.

He announced himself as a presidential candidate in the 2024 Republican primary and later withdrew his campaign to support Donald Trump. No American who was not born in the US can become the president.During the H-1B debate, Vivek Ramaswamy talked American culture down and blamed America's favorite television shows like 'Friends' for the degeneration of American talent. He said top tech companies prefer foreign-born and first-generation engineers over native Americans because American culture always venerated mediocrity over excellence.""A culture that celebrates the prom queen over the math olympiad champ, or the jock over the valedictorian, will not produce the best engineers,"" he said.""More movies like Whiplash, fewer reruns of “Friends.” More math tutoring, fewer sleepovers.

Reducing Sanatana Dharma to casteism won’t work: BJP

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Tuesday cautioned against “organised efforts” to portray the sage-social reformer Sree Narayana Guru , who advocated “one caste, one religion and one God for people”, as a proponent of Sanatana Dharma .He said the Guru was a saint who reconstructed Sanatana Dharma and trying to fix him in the framework of Sanatana Dhar ma was a great insult to him.Inaugurating a conference held as part of the Sivagiri pilgrimage, Vijayan also supported aproposal from Swami Satchidananda, president of Sree Narayana Dharma Sangham Trust, to abolish the custom prohibiting men from covering their upper torsos while entering temples.“Attempts to downplay Sree Narayana Guru as a mere religious leader or a religious saint must be resisted. It should be understood that the Guru had no religion and no caste,” the CM said. He asked people to be vigilant against attempts to present the Guru as an advocate of whatever he fought against.Former Union minister V Muraleedharan accused CM Pinarayi Vijayan of insulting Sanatana Dharma at the sacred site of Sivagiri. He claimed the CM’s actions disrespected the followers of Sree Narayana Guru. He said any attempt to reduce Sanatana Dharma to casteism would find no acceptance in Kerala society.Muraleedharan said Vijayan’s speech at Sivagiri was a continuation of TN deputy CM Udayanidhi Stalin’s call for the eradication of Sanatana Dharma. “Will Vijayan dare to pass such comments on the Holy Quran or any other faith?” he asked.According to Muraleedharan, the Hindu community in Kerala has faced unprecedented challenges during Vijayan’s tenure. He accused Vijayan of attempting to under mine religious beliefs at sites like Sabarimala and during events like Thrissur Pooram and pointed out that the CM has no moral right to criticize the Hindu community.",Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan cautioned against ‘organised efforts’ to portray the sage-social reformer Sree Narayana Guru as a proponent of Sanatana Dharma.

Harry Chandler , a Navy medic who rescued injured sailors during the attack on Pearl Harbor , US, in 1941, has died at the age of 103.He passed away on Monday at a senior living center in Tequesta, US state of Florida, according to Ron Mahaffee, the husband of his granddaughter, Kelli Fahey. Chandler had congestive heart failure, though his age was also noted as a factor.He is survived by one daughter, nine grandchildren, 17 great-grandchildren, and five great-great-grandchildren.Chandler was a hospital corpsman 3rd class when Japanese planes attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, bringing the US into World War II. He was the third Pearl Harbor survivor to pass away in recent weeks.On the morning of the attack, Chandler was raising the flag at a mobile hospital in Aiea Heights, overlooking the harbor. He initially thought the planes were arriving from the mainland until he saw the bombs drop. ""I thought they were planes coming in from the states until I saw the bombs dropping,"" Chandler said, while talking to the news agency AP in 2023. He sought cover, fearing the planes might start strafing.Chandler’s unit traveled to the base in trucks to help the wounded. In an oral history interview, he recalled boarding a boat to pull injured sailors from the oil-covered water. He described washing off the sailors and focusing entirely on his tasks. ""It got so busy you weren’t scared. Weren’t scared at all. We were busy. It was after you got scared,"" he said. Reflecting later, he realized the danger he had faced but said, ""You didn’t think about that while you were busy taking care of people.""The attack killed over 2,300 US servicemen, including 1,177 sailors and Marines on the USS Arizona, which sank within nine minutes of being bombed.Chandler revisited Pearl Harbor in 2023 for a ceremony marking the 82nd anniversary of the attack. ""I look out there, and I can still see what’s going on. I can still see what was happening,"" he said. He urged Americans to ""be prepared,"" adding, ""We should have known that was going to happen. The intelligence has to be better.""After the war, Chandler worked as a painter and upholsterer and served in the Navy reserves, retiring as a senior chief in 1981. Born in Holyoke, Massachusetts, he spent much of his life in South Hadley, Massachusetts, and later split his time between Massachusetts and Florida.Chandler had one biological daughter and adopted two daughters during his second marriage to Anna Chandler, who died in 2004.According to Kathleen Farley, chair of the Sons and Daughters of Pearl Harbor Survivors, Chandler’s death leaves only 15 survivors of the attack on Oahu. Two others, Bob Fernandez, 100, and Warren Upton, 105, also died this month.Military historian J Michael Wenger has estimated that there were some 87,000 military personnel on the island of Oahu the day of the attack.","Harry Chandler was a hospital corpsman 3rd class when Japanese planes attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, bringing the US into World War II.

Tension seems to be mounting in South Korea as investigators issued a strict warning to Yoon Suk Yeol 's supporters, who are trying to block them from arresting the impeached president.The investigators said to Yeol's supporters gathered outside his house in Seoul that they ""could be prosecuted"" if they tried to be a hindrance in the execution of the arrest warrant .""We consider actions such as setting up various barricades and locking iron gates to resist the execution of our arrest warrant as obstruction of official duties,"" Oh Dong-woon, chief of the Corruption Investigation Office for high-ranking officials was quoted as saying by news agency AFP.South Korean investigators on Tuesday announced that a court issued an arrest warrant for suspended and impeached president Yeol in connection with his brief attempt to declare martial law in the country.The Seoul court issued an arrest warrant for Yoon Suk Yeol after investigators sought charges of insurrection and abuse of power.""The arrest warrant and search warrant for President Yoon Suk Yeol, requested by the Joint Investigation Headquarters, were issued this morning,"" the statement said.

Sabah, a Nukhba Platoon Commander in Hamas' Western Khan Yunis Battalion, was reportedly instrumental in orchestrating the October 7, 2023, attack on Kibbutz Nir Oz, which resulted in widespread casualties.According to an official IDF statement, the strike that killed Sabah was carried out in southern Gaza’s Khan Yunis area.The operation, coordinated with Israel's Security Agency (ISA), targeted Sabah based on precise intelligence.The IDF’s statement, shared on X, described Sabah as one of the key figures behind the infiltration of Kibbutz Nir Oz during what it termed the “murderous October 7 Massacre .” Sabah was also accused of spearheading multiple attacks against IDF troops throughout the ongoing conflict.“Abd al-Hadi Sabah, who operated from a shelter in the Humanitarian Area in Khan Yunis, was one of the leaders of the infiltration into Kibbutz Nir Oz during the October 7 Massacre,” the IDF’s post stated. “The IDF and ISA will continue to operate against all of the terrorists who took part in the October 7 massacre.”The IDF also revealed that its forces, in collaboration with the Shin Bet (Israel's General Security Service), recently eliminated 14 Hamas militants, six of whom were directly involved in the October 7 attack. These operations were executed under the command of the IDF’s 162nd ""Steel"" Division, which has been actively engaged in Gaza’s Jabalia and Beit Lahia regions.The October 7 assault by Hamas marked one of the deadliest attacks in recent history, claiming over 1,200 Israeli lives and resulting in more than 250 hostages being taken. While efforts to secure the release of hostages continue, approximately 100 individuals remain in captivity, with many feared dead.In retaliation, Israel launched a large-scale counteroffensive aimed at dismantling Hamas’ infrastructure in Gaza. The campaign, however, has led to significant civilian casualties, with Palestinian deaths exceeding 45,000, according to local reports. The rising humanitarian toll has prompted international calls for an immediate ceasefire.","IDF confirms elimination of senior Hamas commander Abd al-Hadi Sabah in targeted drone strike.

The Pentagon on Monday repatriated a Tunisian detainee who was brought to the US military prison at Guantanamo Bay, the day it opened, was never charged at the war court and was approved for transfer more than a decade ago. Ridah Bin Saleh al Yazidi , 59, spent years languishing at the wartime prison because deals could not be made to repatriate or resettle him.He was airlifted from the base in a secret operation that was completed 11 months after the defence department notified Congress that it had reached an agreement to return him to Tunisian custody, the Pentagon said. It offered no details on the security arrangements surrounding his return.Yazidi's transfer was the fourth in two weeks in a late Biden administration push to reduce the detainee population at the prison, which held 40 prisoners when President Biden took office.

Brad Spafford arrested

150 explosive devices discovered

Neighbor alerted authorities

The Federal Bureau of Investigation recently uncovered 150 explosive devices, mostly pipe bombs, at a Virginia home—a cache federal prosecutors have called the largest collection of ""finished explosive devices"" in the FBI's history. A Virginia man, Brad Spafford, has been arrested in connection with the discovery. He was initially taken into custody for possessing an unregistered short-barreled rifle.Brad Spafford was arrested on December 17 at a farm near Norfolk, following a single-count criminal complaint alleging his illegal possession of an unregistered short-barrel rifle.Upon searching Spafford's 20-acre property in Isle of Wight County, federal agents discovered over 150 explosive devices, primarily pipe bombs, in a detached garage. Some were marked ""lethal."" Additional pipe bombs were found inside Spafford's home within a backpack displaying a grenade-shaped patch and a ""#NoLivesMatter"" logo, according to prosecutors.The ""#NoLivesMatter"" logo is associated with a far-right ideologypromoting violence.Prosecutors in US District Court in Norfolk submitted documents detailing Spafford's explosives to support their request to keep him detained until trial. They described the discovered explosives as the largest collection of ""finished explosive devices"" in FBI history.The investigation into Spafford began in 2023 after a neighbor alerted authorities, as reported by the website Court Watch. The neighbor claimed Spafford lost three fingers on his right hand while working with a homemade explosive. According to the neighbor, Spafford was accumulating weapons and ammunition and had expressed being ""preparing for something"" he ""would not be able to do alone.""The neighbor reported Spafford used President Biden's photos for target practice and believed ""political assassinations should be brought back."" After the attempted attack on then-President-elect Trump in July, Spafford allegedly told his neighbor he ""hoped the shooter doesn't miss Kamala.""During an October visit to Spafford's farm, the neighbor, wearing a recording device, said Spafford discussed having various explosives and plans to fortify his property with ""a 360-degree turret"" for a .50-caliber rifle.","Brad Spafford was arrested on December 17 at a farm near Norfolk, Virginia.

"Death Penalty Avoidance: Military court upholds plea deal, spares 9/11 suspects the death penalty",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/military-court-upholds-plea-deal-spares-9/11-suspects-the-death-penalty/articleshow/116840466.cms,"A military appeals court has upheld a plea deal allowing three men accused of orchestrating the 9/11 attacks to avoid the death penalty, a decision that has left victims’ families devastated and angry, the New York Post reported.The ruling ends a five-month legal battle but deepens frustration over the pursuit of justice for the worst terrorist attack in US history.Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , Walid Bin Attash, and Mustafa al-Hawsawi, held at Guantanamo Bay since 2003, struck a deal to plead guilty to war crimes in exchange for life imprisonment instead of the death penalty.Despite initial intervention by defence secretary Lloyd Austin to revoke the deal, the court ruled on Monday that Austin lacked authority to overturn it, declaring the agreements “valid and enforceable.”“This plea deal is atrocious. It’s salt added to the wound,” said retired FDNY lieutenant Jim McCaffrey, whose brother-in-law, Battalion Chief Orio Palmer, died after reaching the 78th floor of the South Tower. “If anybody deserves the death penalty, these terrorists do.”The plea agreements, signed by Pentagon official Susan K Escallier, have been criticised for bypassing victims’ families. Sally Regenhard, who lost her firefighter son Christian in the attacks, expressed outrage: “These people should have been tried at the scene of the crime in Manhattan federal court, just blocks from Ground Zero.”The original allegations came to light in July when reports revealed the deal, prompting widespread backlash. Austin initially revoked the agreements, giving families a glimmer of hope, but the appeals court rejected his authority to intervene.Maureen Santora, whose firefighter son Christian also died on 9/11, condemned the decision. “Taking the death penalty off the table is deeply disturbing and unjust. These terrorists were responsible for killing nearly 3,000 people. They even told us at Guantanamo Bay, ‘We’d do it again,'""he was quoted as saying by the New York Post.Critics have also linked the case to broader concerns over clemency under President Biden. Retired NYPD officer Jim Smith told the New York Post, “This is part of Biden’s MO. He’s released murderers and rapists. The whole country should feel let down.”The outcome marks another setback in the decades-long effort to secure justice for the nearly 3,000 lives lost in the 9/11 attacks.","Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Walid Bin Attash, and Mustafa al-Hawsawi, held at Guantanamo Bay since 2003, struck a deal to plead guilty to war crimes in exchange for life imprisonment.

Fingerprint data helped investigators



Why did Zapeta-Calil set the woman on fire?



The remains of the victim of the New York subway horror were mostly ashes, placing the investigators in front of a dead end as establishing the identity of the victim became a challenge. What they could gather immediately after the victim was set on fire was that she was an adult woman and had some mobility issues because there was a walker by her side.Rest was in the dark while accused Sebastian Zapeta-Kalil said he had no memory of setting the woman on fire.10 days after the horrific incident for which the NYPD drew flak for their nonchalant behavior, the investigators revealed that the woman was 61-year-old Debrina Kawam from New Jersey. She was a homeless person. There is no evidence that Kawam knew Zapeta-Calil, the 33-year-old illegal migrant, who set her on fire.Investigators established the identity of the victim through fingerprint data, dental records and DNA evidence as there was nothing else. They also gathered surveillance footage from the subways hoping to find a clear image of the woman's face before the fire.The woman was already on the train when Zapeta-Calil boarded it in Queen. They both rode to the end of the line in Coney Island.After arrest, the perpetrator said he had no memory of the incident. They did not know each other. Hence, the horrific incident looks like a freak one that the perpetrator did out of intoxication. Kawam was sitting motionless, probably asleep, when Zapeta-Calil walked up, took out a lighter and set her on fire. He then stepped out of the train and sat on a bench staring at the fire and the smoke. When he set her on fire, he also waved a shirt at her which only helped the fire spread.When Zapeta was witnessing his victim burning down, a viral video showed one NYPD official passing by as the people on the platform were screaming, When the NYPD reached the woman, Zapeta was still on the platform but they did not notice him as they tended to Kawam. Their body cameras captured him and then his photos were released. Three teenagers called 911 and informed the police that Zapeta-Calil was aboard another train in Brooklyn.","Debrina Kawam, 61, was sleeping when she was set on fire.

Joe Biden and Jill Biden do not only pretend to overlook Kamala Harris and Doug Emhoff at public events, but their relationship has actually turned frosty since the vice president's election loss to Donald Trump, the Wall Street Journal reported citing people familiar with their relationship. The Bidens and Kamala Harris appeared so distant in public that many speculate that the Bidens did not even vote for her.They were not present when Kamala Harris gave her election conceding speech. They were seen cold whenever they met in public after the election. Jill Biden hasn't been a fan of Kamala Harris since the 2020 election when Harris accused Biden in a debate of opposing busing policies that desegregated schools she attended as a young Black girl.Though Joe Biden never publicly blamed Kamala Harris for the election loss and wholeheartedly endorsed her as a capable candidate to defeat Trump, now as his presidency is coming to an end, he said that his list of regrets includes opting out of the presidential race.Following Biden's debate performance on June 27 on CNN which was called disaster, Biden dropped out of the campaign on July 21. Kamala Harris got a relatively shorter time for her campaign, though she never blamed Biden for her election defeat. However, there were clashes between the two teams and Kamala Harris could not openly disagree with Biden's policies to lure more voters as she was part of all crucial decisions of the Biden administration.Biden has recently told his associates that he would have won the election but did not hold Kamala Harris responsible for his withdrawal from the race.During the campaigning, there were several instances when Joe Biden's action could be interpreted as sabotage to Harris' campaigning and her campaign was reportedly frustrated with Biden's comments like calling Trump supporters 'garbage' etc.The WSJ report said that the belief that Biden could have won isn’t widely shared in the White House or among the Democratic establishment, where the more common view is that the party would have suffered a much larger electoral defeat and lost even more congressional seats had Biden remained the nominee. White House aides, many who’ve been on job searches since early November, described the work environment in recent weeks with words like “draining” and “depressing.”","The Bidens and Kamala Harris appeared so distant in public that many speculate that the Bidens did not even vote for her.

cross-border militancy

Diplomatic efforts amid rising hostilities

What lies ahead?

Tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan have escalated into deadly clashes at the border, leaving at least eight individuals dead and 13 others, including civilians, injured on the Afghan side. The ongoing conflict, which persisted into late Saturday night, comes amidst the growing strain between the two nations, once considered allies.The violence followed an intense exchange of fire, reportedly triggered by Pakistan's targeted airstrikes on alleged camps of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in Afghanistan's eastern Paktika province earlier in the week.Pakistani security officials claim the strikes were a response to a failed infiltration attempt by militants from Afghanistan.According to Pakistani sources, militants attempting to breach the border on Friday night were repelled by Pakistani forces. The following morning, these militants allegedly joined Afghan forces to launch coordinated attacks on Pakistani border posts using light and heavy weapons. The attacks targeted several areas, including Ghozgarhi, Matha Sangar, Kot Ragha, and Tari Mengal.Pakistani forces retaliated, reportedly inflicting significant losses and forcing the attackers to abandon their posts. However, the violence also claimed the life of one Frontier Corps soldier and left 11 others injured.Pakistan has long accused the Afghan Taliban of harboring TTP militants who have intensified attacks on Pakistani security forces in recent months. These attacks, particularly in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan regions, have heightened security concerns in Islamabad.While urging the Afghan government to take decisive action against the TTP, Pakistan said that dialogue between the two nations could not occur amidst ongoing violence.While these diplomatic calls were failing, tensions flared after Pakistan's airstrikes in the Barmal district of Paktika on December 24, which reportedly killed at least 46 individuals, including women and children. The Taliban's ministry of defense condemned the strikes, describing them as an attack on civilians and vowing retaliation.The airstrikes came on the same day a Pakistani delegation led by Special Representative Muhammad Sadiq met Afghan leaders in Kabul in an attempt to resume diplomatic dialogue after a year-long hiatus. However, the Afghan government lodged a formal protest over the airstrikes, accusing Pakistan of targeting civilians rather than militants.The escalating conflict comes against the backdrop of strained relations following the TTP's termination of a ceasefire with Pakistan in November 2022. Since then, attacks by the TTP have claimed the lives of numerous Pakistani soldiers, further deteriorating ties between the neighbors.The renewed border violence, marked by both airstrikes and ground clashes, shows a growing distrust between Kabul and Islamabad. While Pakistan continues to demand action against the TTP, the Afghan Taliban denies harboring militants and accuses Pakistan of targeting civilians under the guise of counterterrorism operations.","Tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan have escalated into deadly clashes at the border.

Balochistan: 13-year-old among two missing after detention by Pakistani forces,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/balochistan-13-year-old-among-two-missing-after-detention-by-pakistani-forces/articleshow/116738688.cms,"Two people have reportedly gone missing after being allegedly detained by Pakistan's armed forces in Balochistan , with one case involving a 13-year-old boy. The boy, identified as Balach, son of Sabrullah, is from the Panjgur district, and his family members claimed that he was forcibly taken from his home ten days ago during a raid by Pakistani forces.According to The Balochistan Post, Balach was reportedly subjected to physical abuse before being taken away while still injured.Authorities have yet to comment on the incident, which has sparked concern among local and international human rights organisations.The Pakistani military's repeated targeting of the family has been documented, with previous incidents including a raid on their residence where property was damaged and two hand grenades were thrown outside, though no injuries were reported.According to local sources, the forces have conducted regular raids on the house, subjecting the family to continuous intimidation, as per the report.In another incident, Pakistani forces detained a man identified as Fazal Bashir in the coastal city of Gwadar. Fazal, a resident of Hirabad area in Kech district, was detained on December 23, and his location remains unidentified, according to The Balochistan Post.His family has sought assistance from human rights organisations to determine his whereabouts, worried about his safety. The persistent issue of enforced disappearances in Balochistan continues to draw attention, with local activists and human rights organisations demanding accountability and the release of missing persons.Despite continuous calls for justice, these incidents highlight the ongoing accusations against Pakistani security forces in the region.The families of Balach and Fazal have requested authorities to investigate their cases and provide information about their missing relatives.Balochistan continues to witness systematic abductions and killings, affecting various segments of society including activists, politicians, journalists and civilians, who are reportedly taken by security forces, according to news agency ANI.The Pakistani military faces frequent accusations of using enforced disappearances as a tactic against insurgents and separatist groups. Human rights organisations and Baloch nationalist groups argue that these abductions aim to suppress opposition.These disappearances often lead to torture and extrajudicial killings, intensifying the human rights situation in the region, the report added.","The boy, identified as Balach, is from the Panjgur district of Balochistan.

At least 10 people were killed and hundreds injured during the May 9 riots, while approximately 40 public buildings and military installations were damaged, including the Lahore corps commander’s House (Jinnah House) and Askari Tower in Lahore, the army’s general headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) office in Faisalabad, the Radio Pakistan building in Peshawar, a toll plaza on the Swat motorway, and a PAF base in Imran’s hometown of Mianwali.Imran and his party have called for a judicial probe into last year’s events, claiming that violence on May 9 was a “false flag” operation aimed at crushing PTI. The govt and military, however, claimed they had collected substantial evidence that the attack on the country’s most powerful institution was meticulously planned and carried out by the PTI leadership.The US, UK and EU had expressed concerns over the sentencing of civilians by military courts, maintaining that the convictions were against international law.Responding to the concerns raised by countries, the foreign office (FO) had stated on Tuesday that the military courts’ judgments were made under a law enacted by parliament and were in line with the ruling of the Supreme Court of Pakistan.",Pakistan’s military courts sentenced another 60 civilians on Thursday to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years. The latest sentences were announced just days after the same courts handed prison terms to 25 civilians on similar allegations.
