Parliament is not beyond the law, says HC



Rashid's counsel counters NIA's objections



Rashid's terror funding case



NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Tuesday said that both the court and the Lok Sabha Speaker are fully capable of ensuring that Jammu and Kashmir MP Abdul Rashid Sheikh , also known as Engineer Rashid, currently jailed in a terror funding case , abides by the law while attending Parliament.The court later reserved its order on Rashid's plea to participate in the ongoing session.Discounting the National Investigation Agency’s (NIA) concerns over losing control of the accused within Parliament premises, Justice Anup Jairam Bhambhani said, ""Let’s not see ghosts. Let’s not feel so powerless that ‘oh my God, inside Parliament he will do this or that.’ He will be in our custody. Our arms are long enough and strong enough to keep him in line.""After hearing submissions from both the NIA and Rashid’s counsel, a bench of Justices Chandra Dhari Singh and Bhambhani stated that a detailed order would be passed soon.The court suggested that the NIA’s apprehensions could be addressed by imposing stringent conditions on Rashid if he is permitted to attend the session, which runs until April 4. Rashid’s counsel clarified that his plea was not for custody parole but for permission to attend the House while remaining in custody. He assured the court that Rashid would strictly comply with any conditions imposed.The court specified that the Speaker and the secretary general of the Lok Sabha possess sufficient authority to maintain discipline inside Parliament.""We are not granting him bail. He is in custody, and our officers will be with him at all times, except where they are not allowed. He will be in the highest temple of democracy—inside Parliament. Do not undermine the power of the Speaker and the Secretary General to enforce discipline,"" Justice Bhambhani said.In response to the NIA’s insistence on Rashid’s role in the case, the bench assured, ""We do not for a moment undermine the seriousness of the allegations. National security is paramount.""The court also suggested allowing a prison or police official in plain clothes to accompany Rashid inside Parliament if necessary.Facing strong opposition from the NIA, Rashid’s counsel argued that the Parliament’s marshals would maintain strict control over his actions.""The moment he switches on his mic to say anything inappropriate, his mic will be taken away, and he will be thrown out,"" Rashid’s lawyer said.To this, Justice Singh said, ""Then it will become a national issue that his mic has been taken away and he has been thrown out by the marshals.""Rashid’s counsel also informed the court of plans to challenge a March 19 trial court order denying him regular bail.Rashid, an Independent MP from Baramulla who defeated Omar Abdullah in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, is facing trial under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) in a 2017 terror funding case. He was arrested by the NIA in 2019 and has been lodged in Delhi’s Tihar Jail since.The NIA’s case against Rashid stems from allegations that he financially aided separatists and terror groups in Jammu and Kashmir.His name surfaced during the interrogation of businessman Zahoor Watali, a co-accused in the case. A special NIA court framed charges against Rashid in 2022 under IPC sections related to criminal conspiracy, sedition, and waging war against the government, along with UAPA provisions for terror funding.The Baramulla MP was previously granted interim bail for a month in September 2023 to campaign for the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly elections.The high court has now asked the NIA to suggest additional conditions that could be imposed if Rashid is allowed to attend Parliament, reserving its final decision.",Jammu and Kashmir MP Abdul Rashid Sheikh is currently jailed in a terror funding case. The Delhi high court said that both the court and the Lok Sabha Speaker are fully capable of ensuring that Rashid abides by the law.

NEW DELHI: Amidst the row over his recent stand-up show in which he joked about Maharashtra deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde and other politicians, Kunal Kamra on Tuesday shared a video taking an apparent dig at Shiv Sena workers who vandalised the studio where he had performed.Sharing a video in which Kamra can be seen singing a song ' Hum Honge Kangaal ', he inserted the clips of Shinde's Shiv Sena workers vandalising the studio where the stand-up comedian shot the video.The video also shows Shiv Sena workers protesting and burning Kunal Kamra's effigies. The lyrics of the released song read, "".""The duration of the video shared by Kamra is approximately one minute and it is part of the recent stand-up video released by him on YouTube.The Shiv Sena workers vandalised the Habitat centre in Mumbai after Kamra's remarks about Eknath Shinde in the video released on Sunday.

Officials clarified that troops conducted precautionary firing after detecting suspicious movement.Security forces deployed an army helicopter above the area while joint army units, including specially-equipped commandos with heavy weaponry, sniffer dogs, drones and unmanned aerial vehicles, continued searching for terrorists believed to be trapped within the zone.The Special Operations Group (SOG) launched the operation after receiving intelligence about terrorists hiding in a 'dhok'—a local enclosure—at a nursery in Sanyal village, about five km from the Pakistan border, officials said.The hiding terrorists responded with intense gunfire towards the police unit, resulting in a fierce exchange lasting for more than half an hour, they said. Additional forces were promptly deployed to capture the terrorists, who allegedly infiltrated on Saturday either through ravines or via a newly constructed tunnel.Officials reported no casualties from the initial exchange, and the area remained under strict security throughout the night before forces advanced at daybreak.Despite no further contact with the terrorists, Monday's search revealed four loaded M4 carbine magazines, two grenades, a bulletproof jacket, sleeping bags, tracksuits, food packets, and several polythene bags, which will be examined by the bomb disposal squad, officials said.Intelligence suggests two separate groups, each comprising at least five terrorists, infiltrated on Saturday. Local residents organised food provisions for security personnel and media representatives stationed at the outer cordon.Village women gathering firewood spotted approximately five terrorists taking shelter in the large nursery area, as reported by officials.A young girl, aged seven, sustained minor wounds when a bullet grazed her arm. She was subsequently transported to a nearby hospital.According to PTI, Anita Devi, aged 48, around 4:30 pm on Sunday recounted how armed terrorists apprehended her husband whilst they were collecting firewood at the nursery.""The terrorists held my husband at gunpoint and asked me to come near. But my husband signalled me to run and I ran. One of the terrorists tried to stop me but I started shouting, which attracted the attention of two more people who were cutting grass,"" Anita Devi said.","Security forces in Jammu and Kashmir's Kathua district found four loaded M4 carbine magazines, two grenades, a bulletproof jacket, sleeping bags, and food supplies.

"After Nagpur riot, spotlight on kingpin's mentor, once an 'anti-terrorism crusader'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-nagpur-riot-spotlight-on-kingpins-mentor-once-an-anti-terrorism-crusader/articleshow/119509220.cms,"Key riot accused Fahim Khan’s house being demolished in Nagpur on Monday.

NAGPUR: Mohammad Hamid Engineer , a former govt employee turned firebrand commentator, is back in the spotlight after his alleged role in mentoring key riot accused Fahim Khan . Security agencies, long familiar with Engineer's involvement in community affairs, have turned their attention to his social media activity following the Nagpur riots on the night of March 17.Engineer, president of Minorities Democratic Party , was arrested on March 21 for allegedly inciting the riots and charged with sedition. A long-time figure in minority politics, he had allegedly flooded social media with inflammatory posts before the riots.Engineer first gained attention over 15 years ago when his tabloid Iman Ki Awaz foreshadowed serial blasts in Gujarat and later in Jaipur. Copies of the publication were sent to top Gujarat police officers, with Engineer later claiming he had merely pointed out a growing factional dispute within his community that could lead to bloodshed over control of religious shrines.Sources said his writings exposed the influence of a hard-line sect allegedly behind acts of violence. Some security officials saw value in Engineer's revelations, using him as an insider to highlight internal rifts within his community on a broader stage.He crafted an image as an anti-terrorism crusader. But it didn't take long for him to switch from whistle-blower to wanted man. His entanglement in sectarian conflicts brought legal trouble.In 2011, Engineer found himself in custody after mob violence erupted in Nagpur's Mominpura neighbourhood over the controversial burial of Baba Mustafa, a Sufi saint who died on June 28 that year. Engineer's alleged role in the unrest, linked to internal disputes, marked the beginning of a string of legal battles.More recently, his association with Minorities Democratic Party, a group he helped establish, has raised questions. The party's city president Fahim was arrested after a video he allegedly circulated triggered riots in central and north Nagpur.The violence erupted after demonstrations demanding the removal of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb's tomb from Maharashtra's Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar district.Decorated ex-cop and 2003 President's awardee Sambhaji Patil has been enlisted to strengthen 13 riot-related cases with his legal expertise.A former vice principal of a Maharashtra police training school, Patil is now a HC lawyer. Known for his sharp investigative skills, he is guiding Nagpur police, who are struggling with legal complexities in cases involving over 1,200 accused.","Mohammad Hamid Engineer, president of Minorities Democratic Party, was arrested on March 21 for allegedly inciting the riots.

BENGALURU: Five days after making explosive claims in the Karnataka legislative assembly that he and 48 other political functionaries cutting across party lines had been honey-trapped, cooperation minister K N Rajanna Tuesday formally submitted a petition with home minister G Parameshwara, seeking legal action against those involved.Clarifying his earlier statement in the assembly, Rajanna denied ever saying that judges were among the victims.Rajanna handed over a three-page petition detailing the sequence of events. Sharing details of the alleged honeytrap attempt targeted at him, Rajanna said at a joint press conference with Parameshwara: ""I received a woman twice in my Bengaluru office, along with a man. The woman claimed she was a lawyer and wanted to speak to me in person on some issues.""""I cannot recall her name but if paraded before me, I will be able to identify her,"" he said, adding that his residence lacked CCTV cameras.However, Parameshwara, who had promised in the assembly a high-level inquiry after a formal complaint was filed, was evasive on Tuesday, citing procedural constraints. Since the issue was raised in the assembly, Parameshwara said that it was speaker U T Khader who was the ""custodian of the discussion"", and his assistance was necessary to initiate any further action.Reacting to this, Khader said: ""I am not aware of the home minister's statement, but if the points raised by Rajanna are a property of the House, then the assurance by the home minister on the floor of the House is also property of the House. I shall look into the minister's statement and discuss it further.""Parameshwara chose to describe Rajanna's submission as a ""representation"" rather than a formal complaint, saying that any police action would require directives from the speaker.Congress functionaries said Rajanna's complaint, coming just before the CM completes 30 months in office, has put the party in a difficult situation. A minister said: ""If an investigation is taken to its logical conclusion and names tumble out, it could dent our credibility.

NEW DELHI: Amid the spiralling controversy over the alleged recovery of cash from the official residence of Delhi high court judge Yashwant Varma , Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar on Tuesday sounded out political parties on the need to think of a mechanism for putting an end to the ""judges appointing judges"" regime.At a meeting with political parties, Dhankhar asked representatives of political parties to come together on the issue. Earlier, speaking in Rajya Sabha, he described the National Judicial Appointments Commission Act, enacted in 2014 with unanimous support with a view to end the monopoly of the Supreme Court Collegium over appointment of judges of SC and HCs, as a ""visionary step"". Dhankhar faulted the apex court's decision to quash the law.""Now is the befitting occasion to reiterate that it was a visionary step endorsed by Parliament,"" Dhankhar said, remarks which he is learnt to have reiterated during a meeting leaders of political parties on fixing the accountability of judges.In RS, Dhankhar also criticised SC's decision to strike down the NJAC Act. ""There is no constitutional provision of review or appeal of a constitutional amendment. If there is a legislation (passed) by Parliament or state legislatures, judicial review can take place only on whether it is in conformity with the constitutional provisions,"" he said.The deliberations were held against the backdrop of demands in both Houses of Parliament for a discussion over the alleged recovery of cash from Justice Varma's official residence. Speaking in Rajya Sabha, Dhankhar said the country would have been spared of the scandal had the NJAC Act not been struck down by SC in 2015.While the discussion with political parties remained inconclusive, it was decided to hold more rounds. Sources said Dhankhar, a vocal spokesperson for parliamentary supremacy, asserted that this was the time to do something about "" judicial accountability "".

According to a source, Trinamool MPs demanded the issue be discussed on the floor of the House, and not in the ""antechamber"".Leader of house in RS JP Nadda is learnt to have suggested that separate discussions be held with political parties on the course of action, including building a consensus on holding a discussion on the issue in the House, which was agreed upon by floor leaders.The meeting was attended by leaders from BJP, including Nadda and Kiren Rijiju; Kharge and Jairam Ramesh from Congress, Sasmit Patra from BJD, Sukhendu Sekhar Roy, DMK's Tiruchi Siva, Shiv Sena (UBT)'s Sanjay Raut, CPM's John Brittas, AAP's Sanjay Singh, and members from YSRCP and AGP.","Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar asked representatives of political parties to come together on the issue.

NEW DELHI: The bogey of foreign interference continues to plague India-Canada ties with Ottawa listing India among countries that could interfere in the Canadian elections that will be held on April 28.A top Canadian intelligence official said Monday that India has both intent and wherewithal to interfere in Canada’s democratic processes.Canada has in the past too accused India of interfering in its domestic politics. Canadian Security Intelligence Service deputy director Vanessa Lloyd said it was China that was likely to use AI to influence the election campaign but added that India, Russia and Pakistan could also interfere in the elections.“We have also seen that the govt of India has the intent and capability to interfere in Canadian communities and democratic processes to assert its geopolitical influence,” said the official.Canadian PM Mark Carney , who replaced Justin Trudeau earlier this month, has called snap polls on April 28 seeking a strong mandate in the middle of an internecine tariff war with the Trump administration, or what he has described as “the most significant crisis of our lifetimes because of President Trump’s unjustified trade actions and his threats to our sovereignty”.The remarks by the Canadian official follow a period of relative quiet and dialling down of tensions that have rocked the relationship since Trudeau accused New Delhi of facilitating the murder of a Khalistani separatist and Canadian national, Hardeep Singh Nijjar . Carney has expressed interest in rebuilding ties with India, and Indian govt too has said it hopes to do the same based on mutual trust and sensitivity.CTV News quoted the official as also saying that Pakistan could conduct foreign interference activities against Canada in line with its strategic aims and to counter India’s influence. “Pakistan could potentially conduct foreign interference against Canada in line with its strategic aims to promote political, security and economic stability in Pakistan and to counter India’s growing global influence,” added Lloyd.","Canada has in the past too accused India of interfering in its domestic politics.

NEW DELHI: Prashant Kishor , the leader of the Jan Suraaj Party , called for a medical bulletin on Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar's mental health on Tuesday. He alleged that Nitish was being kept away from public events and media interactions to prevent public scrutiny.Speaking at a press conference in Sheikhpura district, Kishor noted that despite these precautions, the JD(U) chief continues to attract attention for his unusual conduct.Kishor, who previously worked with JD(U) before being expelled following disagreements with Kumar, stated, ""Concerns over the chief minister's mental health were first raised by his close aide, the late Sushil Modi, in 2023. For the last couple of years, the people of Bihar have been observing his behaviour.""Although efforts have been made to limit Kumar's public appearances and press interactions, he still draws attention for his irregular behaviour, according to Kishor. ""Kumar has been forgetting the names of cabinet colleagues. He has also been unable to remember, while on tour, which district he was in. During recent agitations over BPSC exams, I learnt he was not aware of the happenings in the state,"" the 47-year-old political figure asserted.He further remarked, ""If a medical bulletin is issued, it will remove from the minds of the people any misgivings about Nitish Kumar's soundness of mind.

A missed opportunity at the 4 Nations Face-Off



Does Gretzky still consider Canada home?

Few athletes in the history of sports have been as popular in Canada as Wayne Gretzky . From his early days as a child prodigy in Brantford to being the heart and soul of the Edmonton Oilers dynasty, his path has been one of unprecedented achievement. For decades, he was not just a hockey player—he was a national symbol. But recent developments have left many Canadians asking: has Gretzky moved away from the nation that raised him?The controversy flared again when Wayne Gretzky showed up as Canada's honorary captain during the 4 Nations Face-Off Final. Rather than wearing a red-and-white jersey to symbolize the nation that turned him into a legend, he showed up in a blue suit. More importantly, he took to the ice close to the U.S. bench and gave a thumbs-up to the American players. The symbolic faux pas left many Canadians feeling snubbed. As one sports writer wrote, he was unable to ""read the room.""This is not the first time Wayne Gretzky's Canadian connections have been called into question. His public endorsement of former U.S. President Donald Trump , including trips to Mar-a-Lago, has also raised questions. While personal politics are a private affair, aligning with a divisive figure often has public repercussions. But, as many fans admit, political decisions don't always determine national identity.What hurts more for Canadians is the feeling that Wayne Gretzky has moved away from the nation that raised him. He departed for Los Angeles in 1988, a deal that made him cry and broke the heart of Edmonton. But even then, Canada still owned him. Now, though, instances like the 4 Nations final present a different tale—one in which Gretzky seems more suited to his life in America than his Canadian heritage.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky's daughter Emma Gretzky celebrates boyfriend Stone Eby’s 22nd birthday with heartfelt tribute All it would have required was a little gesture—a red-and-white jersey, a wink at the nation that built him The Great One.

The RNC sent public records requests this week seeking documents related to voter roll list maintenance in 48 states and Washington, DC, asserting that the public should know how states are removing ineligible people from voter rolls, including the deceased and non-citizens.Trump also declared ""more election actions"" would be taken in coming weeks.The order specifically references India and Brazil as examples of nations implementing advanced voter identification systems.""Despite pioneering self-government, the United States now fails to enforce basic and necessary election protections employed by modern, developed nations, as well as those still developing. India and Brazil, for example, are tying voter identification to a biometric database, while the United States largely relies on self-attestation for citizenship,"" the order said.As part of the overhaul, states are required to prosecute election crimes and share voter lists with federal agencies. States where election officials don't follow the directive will lose their federal government funding.Additionally, the order directs the attorney general to ""prioritize enforcement of federal election integrity laws "" in states which do not inform the federal government about suspected election crimes.To prevent voting in federal elections by non-Americans, which is already illegal and can result in felony charges and deportation, the order requires voters to provide documentary proof of their US citizenship. Agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, the Social Security Administration and the State Department, will have to share federal data to help election officials identify non-citizens on states' rolls.However, voting rights groups have expressed concerns the citizenship requirement provision could ""disenfranchise"" people. Around 9% of American citizens of voting age, or 21.3 million (2.13 crore) people, do not have proof of citizenship readily available, according to a 2023 report by the Brennan Center for Justice and other groups.There are also concerns married women who have changed their names will face trouble when trying to register because their birth certificates list their maiden names. Such hiccups happened in recent town elections in New Hampshire, which has a new state law requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote.The order aims to have votes to be ""cast and received"" by Election Day and says federal funding should be conditional on compliance by states. Currently, 18 states and Puerto Rico accept mailed ballots received after Election Day as long the ballots are postmarked on or before that date, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.Trump's order calls on the Election Assistance Commission to ""amend"" voting system guidelines to ""protect"" election integrity, including guidance that voting systems should not use a ballot that uses a barcode or QR code in the vote counting process.Virtually all in-person voters in Georgia, as well as voters in multiple other states, use voting machines with a large touchscreen to record votes. The machines then print a paper ballot with a human-readable summary of the voter's selections and a QR code, a type of barcode, that is read by a scanner to count the votes.The move is expected to be challenged, as the US Constitution gives states the authority to hold elections. While Congress has the power to regulate voting, the Constitution makes clear that states have primary authority to set the ""times, places and manner"" for elections.Already at least one Democratic attorney has threatened legal action. Marc Elias, who has been the subject of Trump's ire, said in a social media post: ""This will not stand. We will sue.""",US President Donald Trump signed an executive order Tuesday aimed at overhauling his country's election system.

'Nothing in record suggests danger': US judge blocks Trump admin's bid to deport Columbia University student,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/columbia-protest-trump-crackdown-on-protests-judge-blocks-bid-to-deport-columbia-student/articleshow/119510111.cms,"A US judge blocked the Trump government's order to detain and deport a Columbia University student, as President Donald Trump escalated his crackdown on foreign students linked to pro-Palestinian demonstrations.At an emergency hearing held on Tuesday, Manhattan judge Naomi Buchwald issued a temporary restraining order halting the government’s efforts to locate and deport a 21 year old student Yunseo Chung.""Defendants-respondents are enjoined from detaining the plaintiff-petitioner pending further order of this Court,"" Buchwald ruled, quoted by AFP.“I don’t think there is any evidence in the record that she would be a danger to the community,” Buchwald said in court before issuing the ruling.“The notion of putting this 21-year-old, who nothing in the record suggests is a danger … into ICE detention … is not a particularly appealing result,” the she said, quoted by the New York Post.Chung, a South Korean citizen and US permanent resident, was targeted by immigration authorities under the same measures that were used to detain Columbia graduate student Mahmoud Khalil, who is now facing deportation.The government argued that both students undermined US foreign policy, a charge that allows the secretary of state to expel non-citizens.Chung, who has reportedly been in hiding, filed a lawsuit against the government on Monday, arguing that immigration laws were being misused to suppress political speech.""Immigration enforcement -- here, immigration detention and threatened deportation -- may not be used as a tool to punish noncitizen speakers who express political views disfavored by the current administration."" her legal team said.""As of today, Yunseo Chung no longer has to fear and live in fear of ICE coming to her doorstep and abducting her in the night,"" Chung attorney Ramzi Kassem said, referring to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).According to her lawyers, Columbia's public safety department informed Chung that homeland security agents were seeking her arrest. Federal agents also searched two Columbia-owned residences on 13 March in connection with her case, they said.Legal challenges against Trump’s crackdownThe Trump administration has made Columbia University a central focus of its crackdown, cutting $400 million in federal funding on the grounds that the school failed to protect Jewish students from alleged harassment. Trump has framed pro-Palestinian campus demonstrations as antisemitic, while activists argue they are acts of solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.On Tuesday, a group of university professors sued the Trump administration, calling its policies against foreign students and academics unlawful. The lawsuit, filed by the American association of university professors and the American federation of teachers, also seeks to reverse the funding cuts to Columbia.""The policy prevents or impedes Plaintiffs' US citizen members from hearing from, and associating with, their non-citizen students and colleagues,"" the lawsuit read.The Ivy league university responded by introducing measures to address antisemitism and regulate protests, but the administration has stopped short of fully meeting Trump’s demands.Khalil, who played a prominent role in leading student negotiations with university authorities, remains detained in Louisiana while his lawyers fight his deportation. Chung, in contrast, was not a high-profile protest organiser. Her lawyers acknowledge she was arrested and released for ""obstruction of governmental administration,"" with the case still pending in the New York courts.Todd Wolfson, of the American association of university professors, warned that the administration's actions could have broader implications.""The Trump administration is going after international scholars and students who speak their minds about Palestine, but make no mistake: they won't stop there,"" he said.","A US judge blocked the Trump government's order to detain and deport a Columbia University student.

Stranded in ice cold Alaska lake: How did a pilot and 2 children survive the cold night,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/stranded-in-ice-cold-alaska-lake-how-did-a-pilot-and-2-children-survive-the-cold-night/articleshow/119507538.cms,"A pilot and two children miraculously survived for about 12 hours on the wing of a partially submerged plane in an icy Alaskan lake before being rescued by the Alaska Army National Guard on Monday.The Piper PA-12 Super Cruiser had taken off from Soldotna on a sightseeing flight to Skilak Lake on Sunday but never returned. With no locator beacon on board, a desperate search began after a Facebook post urged local pilots to help find the missing aircraft.Among those who joined the search was Terry Godes, who flew his own plane over the rugged terrain of the Kenai Peninsula early Monday. As he approached Tustumena Lake near a glacier, he spotted what looked like wreckage.“It kind of broke my heart to see that,” Godes said.However, he could spot three people on the top of the wing as he got closer and to his amazement, they were alive.“They were alive and responsive and moving around,” he said, adding that they waved at him as he flew over.Godes immediately alerted fellow searchers. Another pilot, Dale Eicher, relayed the coordinates to authorities, as he was closer to Skilak Lake and had better mobile reception.The Alaska Army National Guard dispatched a rescue helicopter from Anchorage, initially planning to hoist the survivors off the wing. However, strong rotor winds made it too risky, especially for the youngest child. Instead, the crew carefully manoeuvred alongside the wreckage and pulled the three on board.Lieutenant colonel Brendon Holbrook, who led the rescue operation, said the adult male had suffered from hypothermia, likely after falling into the water, while the children were relatively dry.The team initially planned to rescue the three survivors off the wing, but the powerful rotor winds made it too dangerous, especially for the youngest girl, who was being tossed around by the force, said Lt Col Brendon Holbrook, commander of the Guard’s 207th Aviation Regiment. Instead, the helicopter carefully positioned itself alongside the wreckage and brought them on board.“They spent a long, cold, dark, wet night out on top of a wing of an airplane that they weren’t planning on,” Godes said.Temperatures had dipped well below freezing overnight. The survivors had only basic clothing suitable for small-plane travel, but nothing to protect them from the extreme cold and biting winds.“It was literally the best possible scenario and outcome,” Holbrook said. “That plane was in the ice with the tail refrozen. If that tail hadn’t refrozen, it would have sunk.”The cause of the crash remains unknown, and the national transportation safety board, along with the Federal Aviation Administration, has launched an investigation.Tustumena Lake, a vast 60,000-acre body of water about 130 kilometres southwest of Anchorage, is notorious for its sudden, treacherous winds. Meteorologists say the surrounding mountains and glacier contribute to unpredictable turbulence in the area.Godes, who knows the region well, described it as a “recipe for chaos.”“Even under what would be considered a benign or relatively weak pressure gradient, the terrain helps turn the winds around, and occasionally they get a little squirrelly,” said Michael Kutz, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.The crash follows a string of recent aviation tragedies in Alaska. Last month, 10 people died when a small commuter plane crashed into sea ice near Nome. In 2019, a midair collision near Soldotna killed seven people, including a state lawmaker.While Monday’s crash could have ended in another tragedy, rescuers say luck and a series of small miracles kept the pilot and children alive.“It's a cold dark place out there at night,” Godes said.","The Piper PA-12 Super Cruiser had taken off from Soldotna on a sightseeing flight to Skilak Lake on Sunday but never returned.

South Korean firefighters make progress in containing wildfires in southeastern regions

South Korea has initiated a full-scale nationwide response to combat lethal wildfires in the southeastern region, said the acting president on Wednesday.""This is a full-scale national response,"" the acting president Han Duck-soo said announcing the elevation of the national wildfire crisis to its highest level.Multiple fires erupted over the weekend, with casualties increasing to 18 as one substantial blaze devastated villages and destroyed a historic temple.A safety ministry representative confirmed to AFP, ""Eighteen people died in the wildfires. Additionally, six people were seriously injured and thirteen suffered minor injuries.""Arid and gusty conditions have impeded fire containment efforts. The president informed an emergency meeting that the fires were ""developing in a way that is exceeding both existing prediction models and earlier expectations.""Despite Tuesday afternoon's emergency evacuations, casualties occurred. The situation worsened overnight with power outages, communication disruptions, and blocked roadways.According to Han, despite thousands of firefighters being deployed, strong winds of 25 metres per second prevented aerial operations using helicopters and drones. He noted that changing wind patterns and persistent dry conditions highlighted the inadequacies of traditional firefighting approaches.Han announced ongoing evacuations to temporary shelters and government efforts to provide emergency assistance and financial aid to displaced residents.Rainfall expected later Wednesday might assist in controlling the fires.Reports indicate the Uiseong fire started accidentally when someone tending to a family grave site unintentionally sparked the blaze.","Multiple fires erupted over the weekend, with casualties increasing to 18 as one substantial blaze devastated villages and destroyed a historic temple.

Impact on voting

US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Tuesday, aimed to reshape the country’s election process, introducing strict requirements that could majorly impact how Americans vote. The order mandated documentary proof of citizenship to register for federal elections and required that all ballots be received by Election Day.Trump’s directive accused the US government of failing “to enforce basic and necessary election protections” and called on states to work with federal agencies to share voter lists and prosecute election-related crimes. States that refuse to comply could see their federal funding reduced, the order warned.The move aligned with Trump’s long-running claims of election fraud, despite a lack of evidence supporting widespread irregularities. Since losing the 2020 election to Democrat Joe Biden, Trump has repeatedly cast doubt on mail-in voting, arguing that it invites fraud, though, without proof.The executive order effectively bypassed congressional Republicans, who have been working on the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, a bill that sought to implement similar voter ID requirements. While it is already illegal for non-citizens to vote in federal elections, Trump and his allies argued that stricter measures are needed to restore confidence in the system.However, voting rights groups warn that the proof-of-citizenship requirement could restrict millions of voters. A 2023 report by the Brennan Center for Justice estimated that 21.3 million voting-age citizens, around 9 per cent, do not have documentary proof of citizenship readily available. The measure could also create complications for married women who have changed their names, as seen in recent local elections in New Hampshire.Trump’s order directed agencies such as the department of homeland security, the social security administration, and the state department to share data with election officials to help identify non-citizens on voter rolls. It also instructed the attorney general to prioritise election crime enforcement, especially in states that refuse to share information with federal authorities.A major change included in the order is a requirement that votes must be both “cast and received” by Election Day. This could affect 18 states and Puerto Rico, where current laws allow ballots postmarked by Election Day to be counted if they arrive later.Trump’s executive order is likely to face immediate legal challenges. The US Constitution grants states primary authority over elections, and while Congress has the power to regulate voting through laws like the voting rights act, legal experts say the president’s ability to unilaterally impose changes is limited.Colorado’s democratic secretary of State Jena Griswold slammed the order as an “unlawful” attempt to manipulate the system, adding that Trump is “trying to make it harder for voters to fight back at the ballot box.”Democratic Congressman Joe Morelle of New York called the executive action “immoral and illegal,” while prominent election lawyer Marc Elias vowed to challenge it in court, stating, “This will not stand. We will sue.”The order also directed the US election assistance commission to update its guidelines, discouraging the use of barcodes and QR codes in the vote-counting process. Many states, including Georgia, rely on voting machines that use QR codes to tally votes. It remains unclear how the order will affect such systems..Georgia secretary of State Brad Raffensperger welcomed the move, calling it a “great first step for election integrity reform nationwide.” Wisconsin Republican Rep Bryan Steil, who chairs the House committee on elections, also praised the order as a “welcome action to secure our elections and prevent foreign influence,” news agency AP quoted.Meanwhile, Trump ally and election conspiracy theorist Mike Lindell has already begun fundraising off the announcement, claiming it will help fix “sick elections.”Trump, while signing the order on Tuesday, said, “This will end it, hopefully,” and hinted that more election-related actions would be announced in the coming weeks.Trump's executive order comes as the Republican national committee launched a massive effort to probe voter registration list maintenance nationwide. The committee sent public records requests this week asking for documents related to voter roll list maintenance in 48 states and Washington, DC, asserting that the public should know how states are removing ineligible people from voter rolls, including dead people and non-citizens.","US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Tuesday, aimed to reshape the country’s election process.

JD Vance says 'I just hate bailing Europe out again'



Fist, American flag and fire



The leak of the US' detailed plan to strike Houthi targets in Yemen on an encrypted messaging app signal put the Donald Trump administration in a tough spot while defense secretary Pete Hegseth brushed aside the allegations and said no war plan was being discussed. Hegseth discredited Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg who claimed that he was mistakenly added to the group where the war plans were leaked.Apart from the massive breach, which the White House has not denied, the chats -- now viral -- revealed the true feelings of Trump officials about Europe.As the 'Houthi PC small group' on Signal started discussing the war plans, JD Vance said he thought it was going to be a mistake. ""3 percent of US trade runs through the suez. 40 percent of European trade does. There is a real risk that the public doesn't understand this or why it's necessary. The strongest reason to do this is, as POTUS said, to send a message.""""I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There's a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.""Hegseth replied to JD Vance and said he fully supported him.""If you think we should do it let's go. I just hate bailing Europe out again,"" JD Vance said.""VP: I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It's PATHETIC. But Mike is correct, we are the only ones on the planet (on our side of the ledger) who can do this. Nobody else even close. Question is timing. I feel like now is as good a time as any, given POTUS directive to reopen shipping lanes. I think we should go; but POTUS still retains 24 hours of decision space,"" Hegseth said. Mike is national security adviser Mike Waltz who said it will have to be the US that reopens these shipping lanes.""Whether it's now or several weeks from now, it will have to be the United States that reopens these shipping lanes. Per the president's request we are working with DOD and State to determine how to compile the cost associated and levy them on the Europeans,"" Mike said in between.Another aspect of the leaked chats that went viral are the emojis that were shared in the group after the US dropped bombs on Houthis. The Atlantic journalist shared a screenshot of Mike Waltz responding wth three emojis: a fist, an America flag and fire. US special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff responded with five emojis: two hands praying, a flexed bicep, and two American flags.","JD Vance and Pete Hegseth hate Europe, bash it as 'pathetic' and 'free-loading' Defense secretary said no war plan was being discussed.

Pakistani YouTube star Rajab Butt has been charged with blasphemy following the launch of his perfume named ""295"", a reference to Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy laws.The case was filed after his video promoting the fragrance sparked outrage, particularly from the hardline Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), which places blasphemy at the core of its political agenda.Butt, who boasts millions of followers online, announced the perfume in a now-deleted video, referencing Section 295 of Pakistan’s penal code, which deals with blasphemy. The move triggered widespread condemnation, with TLP leader Haider Ali Shah Gillani filing a formal complaint against him on Monday.""There are numerous sections in the penal code, but why did he choose blasphemy-related sections to name a perfume?"" Gillani was quoted by the news agency AFP, accusing Butt of attempting to ""normalise"" disrespect towards religious laws.According to AFP, the police charge sheet confirms that Butt has been charged under both blasphemy and cybercrime laws. If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison.As the controversy increased, Butt released an apology video on Sunday, holding a Quran as he sought forgiveness. ""I apologise for the words I uttered during the launch of the perfume,"" he said. He also announced the immediate discontinuation of the product.The controversy also relates to the late Indian rapper Sidhu Moose Wala ’s song ""295,"" which also referenced blasphemy laws. Butt had previously likened himself to Moose Wala, claiming they both faced persecution under similar legal provisions, according to Daily Pakistan.This is not Butt’s first legal battle. In January, he pleaded guilty to illegally owning a lion cub, which he had received as a wedding gift.A Pakistani court ordered him to create 12 educational videos on animal welfare as part of his punishment. He avoided jail time by pledging to use his platform to raise awareness about responsible treatment of wild animals.Blasphemy remains an extremely sensitive issue in Pakistan, where accusations, often unverified, can lead to mob violence and even killings.The legal provisions under Section 295 have been widely criticised by human rights groups for being used as a tool to target individuals, including religious minorities and public figures.","Pakistani YouTube star Rajab Butt has been charged with blasphemy following the launch of his perfume named ""295,"" a reference to Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy laws.

US security blunder reveals Trump top team disparaging Europe allies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-security-blunder-reveals-trump-top-team-disparaging-europe-allies/articleshow/119505063.cms,"Donald Trump

The TOI Correspondent from Washington:

President Trump and top US intelligence officials raced on Tuesday to stem a growing scandal after a journalist was accidentally added to a group chat about air strikes on Yemen’s Houthi rebels in a security breach.Trump brushed off the leak as a “glitch,” while the CIA director and the White House intelligence chief both claimed during a Senate hearing that no classified information was divulged in the conversation on the Signal messaging app. The president also defended his NSA Mike Waltz, who added Atlantic’s magazine’s editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg to the chat by mistake ahead of the air strikes.Goldberg, subsequently wrote an account revealing how shocked he was to be included in the group chat, an inadvertent flub when Waltz likely intended to loop in US trade representative Jamieson Lee Greer, who has similar initials.Amid growing questions about why Trump principals were using a commercial app to discuss national security issues and why Waltz would have Goldberg, a journalist from a publication loathed by Trump among his contacts, the US president stood by his NSA, telling NBC News the breach was “the only glitch in two months, and it turned out not to be a serious one. Michael Waltz has learned a lesson, and he’s a good man.”As much as the security breach, the big takeaway for the rest of the world and the region was the Trump administration’s expectation that Washington would be reimbursed for its bombing of Houthis, ostensibly aimed at keeping the sea lanes open and secure. In the exchange, Trump aides disparaged European allies, suggesting they were freeloaders and discussed extracting reimbursement for the bombing.Vice-President JD Vance, who was among the 18 principals in the discussion, expressed reservations about the bombing and its fallout, but went along with the consensus, telling defence secretary Pete Hegseth, “If you think we should do it, let go ahead. I just hate bailing Europe out again.” Hegseth replied: “I fully share your loathing of European freeloading. It’s PATHETIC.”At this point, a person going by the initials SM (likely Trump aide Stephen Miller) intervenes to say the President has been clear that the US has to be reimbursed for the bombing. “Green light, but we soon make clear to Egypt and Europe what we expect in return,” he says, adding, “We also need to figure out how to enforce such a requirement.”“If the US successfully restores freedom of navigation at great cost, there needs to be some further economic gain extracted in return,” SM adds. There is no mention of India, a major player in the region which also shares with Washington the goal of keeping shipping lanes safe and secure.The exchange was in line with Trump’s view that European Nato partners are not spending enough money on defence, which, in turn, discounts the fact that a victorious US pressured its allies to largely disarm in return for a security umbrella it would provide. A shocked Europe is now on track to re-militarise and not depend on US security guarantees under the Trump regime.Trump’s director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA director John Ratcliffe — who were both reported to be in the chat — endured a stormy Senate Intelligence Committee hearing over the leak. “There was no classified material that was shared,” Gabbard told the committee. She refused however to comment on whether Signal had been installed on her personal phone. Ratcliffe confirmed he was involved in the Signal group and had the app installed on his work computer, but said the communications were “entirely permissible and lawful and did not include classified information.”Democrats and national security pundits, however, jumped on the security flub, relishing the White House’s discomfiture and demanding Waltz and Hegseth resign. Brutal memes, including one showing Putin looking at his cell phone and telling his colleagues, “Wait guys...P.Hegseth is typing...” and “Txt STOP to opt out of update on war plans” followed. Hillary Clinton, who was crucified by Trump and his aides, including Hegseth and Waltz, for her alleged mishandling of classified info and threatened with jail time, had the last laugh on the breach. She posted on X: “You’ve got to be kidding me”.(With input from agencies)","Trump brushed off the leak as a “glitch,” while the CIA director and the White House intelligence chief both claimed during a Senate hearing that no classified information was divulged.

President Trump Stops by Meeting with U.S. Ambassadors

US President Donald Trump on Monday defended national security advisor Michael Waltz, as his administration faces intense scrutiny over the recent Signal text chain leak that inadvertently exposed sensitive war discussions to a journalist.Waltz has been under fire after a staffer in his office mistakenly added Jeffrey Goldberg , editor-in-chief of The Atlantic , to a Signal group chat where high-ranking officials, including secretary of state Pete Hegseth, discussed planned military strikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen. Despite the blunder, Trump dismissed calls for an apology, saying that Waltz was ""doing his best.""""I don't think he should apologise,"" Trump said during a meeting with ambassadors. ""I think he's doing his best.

And if that's true, we're gonna have to find some other form of device,"" Trump said. ""And I think that's something that we may have to do. Some people like Signal very much, other people probably don't, but we'll look into it.""He tasked Waltz with investigating potential vulnerabilities, saying, ""Michael, I've asked you to immediately study that and find out if people are able to break into a system.""In response, Waltz assured the president that White House technical experts and legal teams were actively reviewing the situation.""And of course, we're going to keep everything as secure as possible,"" Waltz said.

Political fallout

White House response

US President Donald Trump revealed that a staffer in national security advisor Mike Waltz 's office mistakenly added The Atlantic's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg to a Signal group chat where senior officials were discussing plans for an upcoming strike on Houthi rebels in Yemen.""It was one of Michael's people on the phone. A staffer had his number on there,"" Trump told NBC in a phone interview when asked how Goldberg ended up in the high-level chat.Despite the blunder, Trump insisted Goldberg's presence in the chat had ""no impact at all"" on the strike.Goldberg published a firsthand account on Monday detailing how he was unexpectedly included in a Signal group chat on March 11, reportedly titled Houthi PC Small Group. The chat allegedly involved high-ranking government officials, including Waltz, secretary of defense Pete Hegseth, CIA director John Ratcliffe , White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, secretary of state Marco Rubio, and Vice President JD Vance.Signal is an encrypted messaging app used for secure communication. Within the group, members reportedly discussed details of the strike on the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen, including its timing.""According to the lengthy Hegseth text, the first detonations in Yemen would be felt two hours hence, at 1.45 pm Eastern time,"" Goldberg wrote. ""So I waited in my car in a supermarket parking lot. If this Signal chat was real, I reasoned, Houthi targets would soon be bombed. At about 1.55, I checked X and searched Yemen. Explosions were then being heard across Sanaa, the capital city.""The accidental inclusion of a journalist in a highly sensitive national security discussion has sparked backlash from Democrats, with calls for Hegseth and Waltz to resign or testify before Congress.Trump, however, stood by Waltz.""Michael Waltz has learned a lesson, and he's a good man,"" the president told NBC on Tuesday.Speaking separately to Fox News, Trump reiterated that Waltz would not be removed from his role, calling the incident a ""mistake"" but maintaining that ""nothing important"" was shared in the Signal thread.The White House communications director, Steven Cheung, dismissed the controversy as another attempt by Trump's opponents to stir outrage.""From the 'Russia, Russia, Russia' hoax of the first term to the fake documents case of the last four years… at every turn anti-Trump forces have tried to weaponise innocuous actions and turn them into faux outrage that Fake News outlets can use to peddle misinformation,"" Cheung posted on X.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also defended the administration, saying on social media that ""no war plans were discussed"" in the chat and ""no classified material was sent.""""Jeffrey Goldberg is well-known for his sensationalist spin. Here are the facts about his latest story,"" Leavitt wrote. ""The White House Counsel's Office has provided guidance on a number of different platforms for President Trump's top officials to communicate as safely and efficiently as possible.""She added that the White House is investigating how Goldberg's number was mistakenly added to the thread but emphasised that ""thanks to the strong and decisive leadership of President Trump, and everyone in the group, the Houthi strikes were successful and effective. Terrorists were killed, and that’s what matters most to President Trump.""","A staffer in national security advisor Mike Waltz's office mistakenly added The Atlantic's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg to a Signal group chat.

JD Vance to accompany Usha Vance on Greenland visit amid escalating diplomatic strain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jd-vance-to-accompany-usha-vance-on-greenland-visit-amid-escalating-diplomatic-strain/articleshow/119498756.cms,"File photo of US Vice President JD Vance with his wife Usha Vance (Pic credit: AP)

US Vice President JD Vance announced Tuesday that he would accompany his wife, Usha Vance , on her upcoming visit to Greenland , intensifying pressure on the autonomous Danish territory that President Donald Trump has expressed interest in acquiring.Vance, a vocal advocate of Trump's foreign policy agenda, said that he would not only visit US Space Force personnel stationed in Greenland but also assess the region's security situation.""There was so much excitement around Usha's visit to Greenland this Friday that I decided that I didn't want her to have all that fun by herself, and so I'm going to join her,"" Vance said in a video statement.His announcement comes in the wake of strong criticism from Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen , who labeled the visit by the US Second Lady as ""unacceptable pressure"" on both Greenland and Denmark.Usha Vance is set to travel to Greenland from Thursday to Saturday, where she will attend the country's national dogsled race in Sisimiut. The event has been largely sponsored by the US consulate in Nuuk, according to Greenlandic media reports.Since returning to office in January, Trump has reignited his push for the US to acquire Greenland, citing national security concerns. He has refused to rule out the possibility of using force, further escalating tensions.In his video, Vance emphasised the territory's strategic importance, claiming that foreign nations seek to use Greenland to ""threaten the United States, to threaten Canada, and, of course, to threaten the people of Greenland.""Vance added, ""Speaking for President Trump, we want to reinvigorate the security of the people of Greenland.""Trump has also recently suggested that Canada should become the ""51st state"" of the United States, raising further concerns about his expansionist rhetoric.The visits from US officials have sparked political backlash in both Greenland and Denmark. Frederiksen condemned the trip, saying, ""You can't organize a private visit with official representatives of another country.""Meanwhile, US National security advisor Mike Waltz and energy secretary Chris Wright are also expected to travel to Greenland this week, according to reports.The visit comes at a sensitive time in Greenland's political landscape, as parties continue to negotiate a new coalition government following the March 11 elections.As a self-governing territory of Denmark, Greenland has long sought greater autonomy from Copenhagen. The region holds vast, untapped mineral and oil reserves, though the extraction of uranium and oil remains banned.With Arctic sea lanes becoming increasingly accessible due to climate change, Greenland has drawn growing geopolitical interest from the United States, China, and Russia, further complicating the situation.","US Vice President JD Vance announced Tuesday that he would accompany his wife, Usha Vance, on her upcoming visit to Greenland.

In a tragic incident, ex-Yankees star Brett Gardener's son, 14-year-old Miller, died following a sudden illness during a family vacation at a Costa Rican resort. Authorities initially thought the cause of the sudden death was asphyxiation but they ruled out asphyxiation Tuesday as they said after examining the body, it was found that his airways were not obstructed. The twisting update raises many questions about the sudden death, but no foul play is suspected yet.Authorities earlier warned that finding out the cause of the death could take months as there is a huge backlog in autopsies because of the country's high murder rate.Gardner was found dead in a Costa Rican hotel room on Friday while on vacation with his family. His family said in a statement on Sunday that other members of the family had fallen ill alongside their youngest son.“We have so many questions and so few answers at this point, but we do know that he passed away peacefully in his sleep on the morning of Friday, March 21st,” Brett and Jessica Gardner said in their statement.“Miller was a beloved son and brother and we cannot yet comprehend our life without his infectious smile,” the boy’s parents added. “He loved football, baseball, golf, hunting, fishing, his family and his friends. He lived life to the fullest every single day.”“Our hearts are heavy, and the Yankees family is filled with grief,” the team said in a statement. “It wasn’t just Brett who literally grew up in this organization for more than 17 years -- so did his wife, Jessica, and their two boys, Hunter and Miller.”Hotel La Mariposa and Restaurant Le Papillon, where the Gardners dined while on vacation, tried to distance itself from the teen’s tragic death. “In response to misinformation on social media, we would like to clarify that the Gardner family visited our Le Papillon restaurant on Tuesday evening, March 18, three days before Miller’s unfortunate passing,” the eatery said, according to Costa Rican outlet Diario Extra.",Gardner was found dead in a Costa Rican hotel room on Friday while on vacation with his family.

CIA director John Ratcliffe acknowledged that he was part of the Signal group chats from which have been leaked in a major security breach that the Donald Trump administration played down. Ratcliffe faced intense grilling as he, Tulsi Gabbard and Kash Patel appeared in a Senate hearing on a different issue, but the 'war plan' chat leak dominated the discussion.DNI Tulsi Gabbard initially refused to address any question regarding the chat leak, and FBI chief Kash Patel, who was not on the Signal group, sidestepped a question on whether his agency would look into the chat leak.Ratcliffe said nothing classified was shared in the group chat in the line of the administration. He said his part of the conversation was “entirely permissible and lawful and did not include classified information .” Ratcliffe also said the inclusion of a journalist in a sensitive Signal group chat among Trump administration officials discussing war plans was “of course not” appropriate.The comment from Ratcliffe came as Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet pressed him on the CIA’s rules regarding the handling of classified information and whether those rules were followed in the Signal chat.“Does the CIA have any rules about handling of classified information? Yes or no,” Bennet asked, prompting an affirmative answer from Ratcliffe.Bennet then asked Ratcliffe whether he agreed with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s view of the journalist who reported on the chat as “deceitful and highly discredited.” Ratcliffe responded that he didn’t know the journalist, Jeffrey Goldberg, and didn’t have an opinion about him as a person.Editor-in-chief of the Atlantic Jeffrey Goldberg reported Monday that he had been accidentally added to the chat, titled ""Houthi PC small group,"" ahead of a U.S. attack on Iran-backed Houthi sites in Yemen on March 15.","CIA director John Ratcliffe acknowledged that he was part of the Signal group chats from which have been leaked.

They think he was treated very unfairly. And I looked at the records, studied the records, and he was a victim of a crime, as far as I'm concerned. So we're going to undo that… Congratulations, Devon,"" Trump said before officially signing the pardon.Archer, who was involved in business dealings with Hunter Biden at Burisma Holdings , was convicted in 2018 for his role in defrauding a Native American tribe.

Conditions for implementation

US offers concessions on Russian agriculture

Ongoing military tensions

Russia and Ukraine have reached an agreement to halt military strikes in the Black Sea and on energy infrastructure following negotiations mediated by the United States . The talks, held over three days in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, mark a significant diplomatic effort as US negotiators shuttled between delegations from both countries.In parallel statements, the White House announced that both nations had ""agreed to ensure safe navigation, eliminate the use of force, and prevent the use of commercial vessels for military purposes in the Black Sea."" The agreement also includes efforts to enforce a ban on attacks targeting energy sites in Ukraine and Russia.While Ukraine has welcomed the development, the Kremlin said that the agreement on the Black Sea would only take effect after restrictions on its agricultural sector are lifted. Moscow has long pushed for the removal of Western-imposed limitations, particularly those restricting Russian access to international financial systems.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy acknowledged that it remains to be seen whether the agreement will be fully implemented but emphasised that it represents ""the right steps"" toward peace. He also indicated that discussions had included the possibility of involving third-party nations in monitoring compliance, Turkey for the Black Sea and a Middle Eastern country for energy agreements.As part of the negotiations, the US pledged to ""help restore access to the world market"" for Russian agricultural and fertilizer exports. Although direct sanctions on Russian agriculture were never imposed, restrictions on payment systems had effectively limited trade. Moscow has frequently accused Western policies of exacerbating global food prices, particularly in developing nations.Russia said that the agreement would only come into force following the removal of sanctions on the Russian Agricultural Bank and other financial institutions engaged in food trade, including their reconnection to the SWIFT international payment system.Zelenskyy, while acknowledging that he was unaware of the full details of the US decision, expressed concern that such a move might weaken existing sanctions against Russia.Despite this diplomatic breakthrough, tensions remain high on the battlefield. Ukraine's defense minister Rustem Umerov noted that specifics of the Black Sea agreement were still being finalised. He warned that if Russian warships moved from the eastern part of the Black Sea, Ukraine would retain ""the full right to exercise self-defense.""Earlier this month, Ukraine accepted a US-proposed unconditional ceasefire, but Russia declined, with Kyiv accusing Moscow of seeking to strengthen its position before engaging in peace talks.Meanwhile, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov gave no indication that Moscow was willing to agree to a broader ceasefire, instead prioritising Black Sea shipping. He also accused Western nations of attempting to ""contain"" Russia, drawing comparisons to historical figures such as ""Napoleon and Hitler.""","Russia, Ukraine agree to halt strikes in Black Sea, energy sites in US-brokered talks.

QUETTA: The Balochistan government , under the leadership of chief minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti , has decided to take stringent measures against government employees involved in anti-state activities , as reported by ARY News.In a high-level meeting chaired by CM Bugti, which was attended by the IG Balochistan and the chief secretary, the government announced that it would target individuals involved in anti-state propaganda and activism.According to ARY News, CM Bugti instructed all commissioners and district officers to act swiftly against any government employees suspected of promoting anti-state narratives or participating in activities that challenge the state's authority. The government's move appears to be a direct attempt to suppress activism and dissent within the province, especially among those critical of the state's policies. Bugti also confirmed that individuals involved in such actions would be placed under strict surveillance by being added to the Fourth Schedule for closer monitoring.ARY News also reported that CM Bugti directed all heads of educational institutions in the province to ensure the national flag is hoisted and the national anthem is recited regularly. Educational leaders who fail to enforce these directives are being told to resign, which signals a heightened crackdown on any form of resistance within these spaces.This renewed focus on stifling activism in Balochistan reflects the government's broader strategy to assert control over the region, including monitoring and potentially silencing any opposition to its policies.This comes amidst the detention of Baloch leaders and activists. Activists in the Balochistan region have frequently organised protests and campaigns, calling attention to the region's marginalisation.In response, governments have implemented harsh crackdowns, often leading to the detention of Baloch leaders and activists. These actions have sparked widespread criticism from international human rights organisations, highlighting concerns over the suppression of political expression and the stifling of peaceful advocacy for regional rights.","The Balochistan government has decided to take stringent measures against government employees involved in anti-state activities.
