SC stays exhumation of bodies of tribal Christians for burial elsewhere,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-stays-exhumation-of-bodies-of-tribal-christians-for-burial-elsewhere/articleshow/128534664.cms,"Supreme Court

New Delhi: Supreme Court has put an interim stay on the exhumation of bodies of tribal Christians in certain Chhattisgarh villages for their relocation to the religious community's designated graveyards, as an NGO said this act violates the fundamental rights of local Christians to be buried in their villages.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta agreed on Wednesday to hear a petition by the NGO - Chhattisgarh Association for Justice and Equality - after senior advocate Colin Gonsalves cited SC's split verdict on a plea seeking burial of a pastor's body in his village or his agricultural field.While one judge had permitted the petitioner to bury his father's body in his private land, the other judge had said no citizen had an unqualified right to choose the place of burial. After the split decision in Jan last year, the bench had directed burial of the body at a designated burial ground 25-30 km from the village in Chhattisgarh.After hearing Gonsalves, Justices Nath and Mehta sought response from the Chhattisgarh govt to the PIL and ordered that no further exhumation of bodies would be permitted.Gonsalves accused the state govt of misusing the split verdict to stop burial of tribal Christians at places within a village's precincts.The senior advocate said the court must intervene to direct that irrespective of religion, caste or status, every dead person has a right to burial at demarcated places in his/her village.The petitioner said the authorities should be directed to demarcate such land for burial in those villages which do not have designated burial grounds.Interestingly, the bench of Justices Nath and Mehta on Monday had refused to entertain a petition challenging the Oct 28, 2025 order of the Chhattisgarh high court asking the petitioners to approach statutory authority on their grievances against gram sabhas which have put up hoardings barring entry of Christian pastors and priests purportedly to prevent conversion through allurement.",Supreme Court has put an interim stay on the exhumation of bodies of tribal Christians in certain Chhattisgarh villages.

New Delhi: On a petition highlighting a racially motivated attack last December that led to the death of Anjel Chakma in Uttarakhand, Supreme Court Wednesday said those who attack people for their appearance, language, race, region or origin must be dealt with an iron hand.A bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi said this while expressing reluctance to enter the legislative domain and lay down a mechanism under penal law for prevention of group-perpetrated violence against people on the ground of race, place of birth and language.Petitioner Anoop Prakash Awasthi highlighted the repeated instances of violence in many parts of the country against people from north-eastern states solely because of their physical features and said they were routinely abused with racial slurs. ""Killing of Anjel Chakma is not an isolated incident but forms part of a long-standing pattern of racial violence against citizens from north-eastern states, including the death of Nido Taniam in 2014 and numerous assaults on students and workers in metropolitan cities, a phenomenon formally acknowledged by the govt in parliamentary replies, yet left unaddressed through any dedicated legislative or institutional framework,"" Awasthi said.The CJI-led bench said the strong federal character of India, founded on unity of citizens despite cultural, linguistic and regional diversity, could not be allowed to be undermined by such crimes, which needed to be dealt with an iron hand.The bench said the petitioner's plea for the court to lay down guidelines, on the lines of Vishaka judgment to prevent sexual harassment of women at the workplace, to prevent violence against people based on race, region and language till Parliament enacted a law would be better dealt with by the govt.The court asked Awasthi to give a copy of the petition to attorney general R Venkataramani and requested the AG to take up the issue with the authorities concerned in the Union govt.",Petitioner Anoop Prakash Awasthi highlighted the repeated instances of violence in many parts of the country against people from north-eastern states solely because of their physical features.

INDORE: Displaying striking indifference during a crime scene reconstruction, the accused in the murder of a 24-year-old MBA student reacted casually when questioned by reporters, brushing aside queries about the killing.Surrounded by media personnel on Tuesday, Piyush Dhamnodiya shrugged off questions about the motive behind the murder. “Kuch nai hua hai, chhodo, ho gaya jo hogaya yaar… chhod do na… kya karoge jaan ke,” he said in Hindi, refusing to explain his actions. When asked whether he regretted the crime, he responded with a faint smirk and said he would reveal the reason “when the time comes”.Police officials present at the reconstruction described his demeanour as unusually calm. Officers said his behaviour during interrogation and subsequent proceedings appeared erratic and detached.According to investigators, the accused allegedly muttered apologies in the hours following the crime and claimed he wanted to “communicate with the victim’s spirit”. He also told police he had contemplated suicide by jumping in front of a train but did not act on it.During questioning at the Dwarkapuri police station, Dhamnodiya reportedly asked for a blank sheet of paper and wrote that he had committed a “grave wrong” and wanted to die.He repeatedly requested officers to let him meet the victim, claiming he loved her.DCP Krishna Lalchandani said the accused had been consuming occult-related online content and searching for suicide methods, though he never attempted self-harm. Investigators also learned that Dhamnodiya suspected the victim of speaking to other men.Police said the woman’s body was recovered on Feb 13 from a rented room in Indore, three days after she was reported missing. Dhamnodiya, identified as her boyfriend and classmate, was traced to Mumbai and arrested from Andheri on Feb 14.During interrogation, police alleged that Dhamnodiya tied the victim’s hands and legs, gagged her and strangled her. Officers further claimed he later purchased beer, returned to the room and consumed alcohol beside the body. Investigators accused him of sexually assaulting the corpse and engaging in acts of necrophilia before fleeing.Police said the accused travelled by train after leaving Indore, changing routes before reaching Mumbai. Investigators stated he later went to a deserted location near Panvel, where he allegedly lit incense sticks and watched online videos about summoning spirits.Dwarkapuri police seized items linked to the crime and recreated the scene. The accused is scheduled to be produced before a court on Wednesday.","Piyush Dhamnodiya shrugged off questions about the motive behind the murder.

Gurgaon: Shocking Murder, School Chaos, Delivery Scam Bust & More





ROHTAK: The murder of a 27-year-old bank employee, found with her throat slit near Bahadurgarh in Jhajjar district, was solved within 18 hours, with police arresting her husband — a chartered accountant from Hisar — as the prime accused.Investigators said the accused killed his wife over repeated suspicions about her character and then attempted to pass it off as a robbery-cum-murder.The victim, Mahak, worked with HDFC Bank in Gurgaon.She was married to Anshul Dhawan, a chartered accountant and resident of Hisar’s Sector 14, on September 25, 2025, in an arranged marriage. The couple had been married for barely five months.On Valentine’s Day (February 14), the couple visited Hisar and stayed with family.The next evening, around 7 pm on February 15, they left Mahak’s parental home in Hansi for Gurugram. About four hours later, Anshul called the police, claiming unidentified attackers had intercepted their car near Pahsaur village in the Badli area of Jhajjar district, killed his wife, and fled.Police found Mahak’s body lying outside the car on a dirt track about 100 metres off the Jhajjar-Badli road. Her throat had been slit.However, Anshul’s version soon fell apart during questioning. He failed to describe the alleged attackers and repeatedly changed his statement.During sustained interrogation and a crime scene reconstruction, Anshul confessed. Police said the couple frequently argued over his suspicions about Mahak’s character. The dispute escalated during the drive, leading him to first strangle her and then slit her throat with a pair of scissors, allegedly while wearing gloves to avoid leaving evidence. He later staged the scene to resemble a robbery.Mahak’s father, Krishna Kathuria, had expressed suspicion against his son-in-law from the outset. Family members also stated that Mahak was pregnant at the time of her death.Police have arrested the accused and are proceeding with further investigation.","The victim, Mahak, worked with HDFC Bank in Gurgaon.

‘Targeting People Like Terrorists’: Mamata Banerjee Attacks EC Over SIR, Cites Bangladesh Polls

Mayapur/Kolkata: Politics surrounding SIR took a back seat to spiritual reflection as home minister Amit Shah travelled Wednesday to Mayapur in Bengal's Nadia, the cradle of Bhakti movement, for a pre-poll Matua outreach focused on highlighting the community's contribution towards what he called ""unification of Hindu society"".Shah lavished praise on social reformers like Matua Mahasangha founder Harichand Thakur and his son Guruchand Thakur and the Vaishnavite saint Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati, whom he described as the bridge between the Bhakti movement and ""modernity"". ""Harichand and Guruchand Thakur, and Matua society as a whole, took the idea of social welfare forward,"" he told a gathering, highlighting their campaign against untouchability and promotion of education and gender equality within the community.Shah, a guest at the 152nd birth anniversary of Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati, said he was in Mayapur not as the home minister but as a devotee of the founder of 64 Gaudiya maths (monasteries) in India and abroad.Conveying PM Modi's ""Hare Krishna"" greeting to those attending the event, Shah said, ""Whenever foreign guests visit Modiji, he presents them a copy of the Bhagavad Gita. The epicentre of Bhakti movement was in Nadia and will spread in the days to come.I am sure we will be able to send the message of Viksit Bharat and Sanatan (dharma) to the world.""Sources said Shah's visit was crucial to BJP's relationship with Matua Mahasangha, an influential community in large parts of southern WB, ahead of polls later this year. But party functionaries in Bengal insisted that the HM didn't want politics to creep into his message of solidarity with the community.","Home minister Amit Shah travelled to Mayapur in Bengal's Nadia, the cradle of Bhakti movement.

New Army Video Highlights Operation Sindoor Strikes On Terror Camps And Airbases

NEW DELHI: In the aftermath of the Pahalgam terror attack in J&K, CRPF has set up 43 temporary operating bases across the UT, each housing 16-25 personnel who will track and eliminate terrorists holed up in the higher reaches, security officials said on Wednesday.The temporary bases, 26 of which are located in the Kashmir division and 17 in the Jammu division, sit at a height of 6,000 feet and above. CRPF troops, accompanied by a few J&K Police personnel, use these bases for a few days at a time to launch search and assault operations against terrorists who usually use 'dhoks' (mud and stone huts) as temporary hideouts, awaiting instructions from their Pakistan-based handlers to execute terror attacks.CRPF has procured special equipment for these temporary bases, like tactical boots, winter jackets, sleeping bags and satellite phones.There are about two local terrorists and around 100 foreign terrorists active at present, according to data.The first set of such temporary bases were established by CRPF in April 2025 along the Pahalgam-Tral-Harwan axis, immediately after the April 2025 terrorist attack in Pahalgam.CRPF and other security forces had used one such base to zero in on the hideout of the three Pahalgam attackers, all Pakistanis, near the Dachigam area in Srinagar. All three terrorists were eliminated in Operation Mahadev in July 2025.Prior to the Pahalgam terror attack, the Pakistani terrorists had taken shelter in a dhok near the tourist site in Baisaran where they would gun down 25 tourists. The terrorists escaped into the surrounding forest soon after the attack. The security forces had to scour the forests for months before they could track their location.","The temporary bases, 26 of which are located in the Kashmir division and 17 in the Jammu division, sit at a height of 6,000 feet and above.

Indore: A video of a woman being beaten in Indore has exposed a disturbing surge in mob violence fuelled by rumours of child-lifting, with innocent people being attacked in multiple districts of Madhya Pradesh without any evidence.The woman in the video, who was assaulted in Bhanwarkuan area here, was identified as Rekha Devi, a 45-year-old woman with mental health issues who has been missing from Meerut for over a year. After her daughter traced her through the clip, police confirmed that Rekha had been questioned and released as she was not involved in any crime. She has since gone missing again.Rekha's case is part of a wider pattern of panic-driven attacks in Indore and its neighbouring districts where strangers are being confronted and beaten on the mere suspicion of being child-lifters. Police said that none of the recent cases involved any actual kidnapping.In Ratlam, six men returning from a temple were dragged out of their car and assaulted by villagers when they stopped at a roadside dhaba. A 34-year-old researcher was surrounded, beaten and filmed by a group of women who accused her of child-lifting in Indore's MIG area.In Dhar district, five itinerant workers from Rajasthan narrowly escaped after being attacked over similar rumours.Dewas police arrested two men for spreading false messages and inciting attacks on passersby.Senior officers have warned that rumours circulating on WhatsApp and local networks are triggering fear and mob violence.""There is no confirmed child abduction gang operating in Indore or nearby districts,"" said Indore police commissioner Santosh Kumar Singh. ""People must not act on rumours or take the law into their own hands,"" he said.Police have urged citizens to report suspicious activity instead of confronting individuals, stressing that rumour-mongering and mob assault are criminal offences.","A video of a woman being beaten in Indore has exposed a disturbing surge in mob violence fuelled by rumours of child-lifting.

MUMBAI: A child raised exclusively by her mother cannot be compelled to carry her father's surname and caste merely because the format once demanded it, Bombay HC said recently.The order was in response to a petition filed by a 12-year-old girl seeking correction of her name in school records and also of the caste entry from 'Maratha' to 'Scheduled Caste'.The child's request was rejected by school authorities last year, citing Secondary School Code.The HC ruling, made available on Wednesday, stated: ""Recognition of a single mother as a complete parent for purposes of a child's civic identity is not an act of charity; it is constitutional fidelity. It reflects the movement from patriarchal compulsion to constitutional choice, from lineage as fate to dignity as right.""The court further said, ""A society that claims to be developing cannot insist that a child's public identity must be anchored to a father who is absent from the child's life, while the mother, who bears the entire burden of upbringing, remains administratively secondary. The state's formats must not become moral judgments; they must become accurate instruments of welfare.""A school record was not a private note but ""a public document that follows a child across years, institutions, and sometimes into the professional domain"", observed Justices Vibha Kankanwadi and H S Venegaonkar in a Feb 2 judgment from Bombay HC's Aurangabad bench.""If lived guardianship is maternal, the record cannot insist on paternal visibility as a matter of routine, and then call it administrative neutrality. ''The child's mother was a single parent and her natural guardian, HC said. The mother had accused the child's father of sexual assault. Later, they reached a settlement, and it was agreed that the daughter would remain in the permanent custody of the mother.The minor and her mother, both petitioners, asserted that continuation of the father's surname in the school record did not merely create an inaccuracy but also ""an avoidable social vulnerability for a child who must grow up, learn, and form her identity in society that often treat names as identity for family history"".","A child raised exclusively by her mother cannot be compelled to carry her father's surname and caste, Bombay HC says.

Congress In Damage Control Mode After Mani Shankar Aiyar’s Baton Remark To Kerala Chief Minister

NEW DELHI: Veteran Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar on Wednesday doubled down on his recent remarks in which he described himself as a “Gandhian”, a “Nehruvian” and a “Rajivian”, but not a “Rahulian”.The sidelined leader said that he is not a “Rahulian” because Rahul Gandhi is “far too much younger” than him and “far too distant” in his political life.Speaking to PTI, Aiyar said, “I recently said that ‘I am a Gandhian, I am a Nehruvian, I am a Rajivian, but I am not a Rahulian’.”Explaining why he described himself as a “Gandhian”, Aiyar said, “I was six-year-old and my brother was four when Mahatma Gandhi picked us up in his arms and said ‘ye mere aankhon ke suraj aur chand hain’.” “From there, I became a ‘Gandhivaadi’.”On his identification with India’s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, he said, “As for Nehru, I was six when he became the prime minister, and I was 23 when he ceased being one, so my entire growing-up years were steeped in the Nehruvian ethos; that is why I also regard myself as a Nehruvian.”Aiyar said he considers himself a “Rajivian” because of his association with former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi.“I call myself a Rajivian because it was he, although two years younger than me, who astonished me by bringing me into the PMO and by doing the things he did… I could not believe it. That is how I became a Rajivian,” he said.He also clarified that he did not describe himself as an “Indiravian” as he “totally disapproved” of Indira Gandhi “converting our democracy into a tyranny by declaring an Emergency, albeit for only 18 months”.Referring to his comment on Rahul Gandhi, Aiyar said, “How can one expect me to be a ‘Rahulian’ when the boy is about 30 years younger than me, and I haven’t had an opportunity to work with him? That is why I cannot be a ‘Rahulian’ because he is far too much younger than me and far too distant from me in his political life.”The remarks come amid strained ties between Aiyar and the Congress leadership. The controversy began after he praised the Pinarayi Vijayan-led government in Kerala and expressed confidence that the chief minister would continue in office.Speaking at an international seminar in Thiruvananthapuram, Aiyar had said, “So, in the presence of the chief minister, who I am sure will be the next chief minister, I renew my plea that to reinforce Kerala as the best Panchayati Raj state in the country, state laws should be amended based on practical experience, Thomas Isaac's insights, the five-volume report I chaired and the note on district planning by V Ramachandran circulated by the Planning Commission when it truly supported Panchayati Raj. ”The Congress distanced itself from his remarks. Party spokesperson Pawan Khera said that Aiyar “has had no connection whatsoever with the Congress for the past few years” and that he speaks and writes purely in his personal capacity.Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said that the people of Kerala would bring the Congress-led United Democratic Front back to power in the state.","Veteran Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar doubled down on his recent remarks in which he described himself as a ‘Gandhian’, a “Nehruvian” and a “Rajivian, but I am not a Rahulian�” The sidelined leader said that he is not a ”Rahulian“ because Rahul Gandhi is “far too much younger” than him and ‘far too distant’ in his political life.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128504743,imgsize-1016593,width-400,resizemode-4/128504743.jpg"

He went on to say that the BJP government had ""given birth to a boy"" in its first budget and continued to do so in subsequent budgets, adding that ""one who gives birth to a boy in their youth is always useful"".Targeting the previous Congress government, Koli said that when Ashok Gehlot was chief minister, announcements made in the last budget resulted in the ""birth of a girl, not a boy"", and claimed that this was why the Congress was now in the opposition, news agency PTI reported.The remarks drew strong protests from Congress members on Tuesday. Leader of the opposition Tika Ram Jully criticised the statement, calling it discriminatory and inappropriate.""On February 16, your MLA, while speaking on the budget, made remarks that discriminate between a son and a daughter. Your MLAs were laughing. I feel ashamed that even today such thinking persists,"" Jully said. Referring to his own family, he added that he has two daughters and questioned how such views could be held ""in this day and age"".Jully demanded that the ruling party clarify its position, asserting that gender-based analogies had no place in a serious discussion on the budget.Defending his remarks later, Koli told reporters, ""What is wrong with this? It is our Brijbhasha."" Asked if the statement was inappropriate, he said, ""Kya bayan galat tha (How was the statement wrong)? I said a good budget has been tabled; that a chhora (boy) has been born.""He further claimed that the Congress had presented a ""populist budget ahead of elections to fool the public"", which he likened to ""the birth of a girl child"".","Weir MLA Bahadur Singh Koli drew a gendered comparison between present BJP government's budget and that of the previous Congress regime.

WASHINGTON: A red, white and blue colour scheme championed by President Donald Trump will become the new look for Air Force One, the US military said Thursday.The Air Force said a ""red, white, gold and dark blue paint scheme"" will be used for the updated jet that is slated to serve as Air Force One as well as other, smaller jets that routinely fly other top government officials.The military released a rendering of the new look that matches an airplane model that has been seen in the Oval Office for meetings with foreign leaders.Boeing is in the process of modifying two of its 747-800 aircraft that are slated to replace the existing fleet of two aging Boeing 747-200 aircraft that the president currently uses and that take on the Air Force One call sign when the president is aboard.In 2018, Trump directed that those new jets would ditch the iconic Kennedy-era blue-and-white design for a white-and-navy colour scheme. Instead, the top half of the plane would have been white, while the bottom, including the belly, would have been dark blue. A streak of dark red would have run from the cockpit to the tail. The colouring was almost identical to the exterior of Trump's personal plane.An Air Force review had suggested the darker colors would increase costs and delay delivery of the new jumbo jets, and President Joe Biden reversed the decision in March 2023.Trump told reporters last month that ""we want power blue, not baby blue,"" referring to the current colour of the aircraft.""Everything has its time and place. We'll be changing the colors,"" Trump added.The Air Force's statement says a third 747-8i Boeing jet will be painted in the same colours.Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth formally accepted a luxury Boeing 747 jet from Qatar last May for use as Air Force One despite questions about the ethics and legality of taking the expensive gift from a foreign nation.Air Force Secretary Troy Meink told lawmakers last June that the security modifications to the jet would cost less than USD 400 million but provided no details.","The Air Force said a ""red, white, gold and dark blue paint scheme"" will be used for the updated jet.

A video is spreading fast online, and many people are asking the same question, does Shia LaBeouf really have a twin sister? The short answer is no. A TikTok user named Anya Wick shared a video claiming she is the twin sister of Shia LaBeouf. The clip was later posted on X by a user named @maximumpain333 and gained about 4.7 million views.

There is no verified record of him having a twin or any siblings. Anya Wick also claimed that her father is Stephen Bruce Epstein and said he is the brother of Jeffrey Epstein. That claim is also not supported by known information. Jeffrey Epstein’s only known brother is Mark Epstein.

'Wait For Our Ababil Drone': Iran TV Flashes 'KILL LIST' Of 7 Top Israeli Figures Including Netanyahu





The United States could be on the brink of a major military operation against Iran, with officials warning that conflict could break out in the coming days or weeks if diplomatic efforts fail. Sources told Axios that a potential campaign would be “massive, weeks‑long” and far larger than last month’s pinpoint operation in Venezuela, likely conducted jointly with Israel and targeting Iran’s nuclear and missile infrastructure.Former IDF military intelligence chief Amos Yadlin told Times of Israel that such a confrontation could be imminent. “Last week I allowed myself to fly to the Munich Security Conference. I would think twice about flying [abroad from Israel] this weekend,” he said.Yadlin, now heading a national security consultancy, added: “We are much closer than we were before, but I remind you — a superpower does not go to war in a matter of days. There is a diplomatic path that must be exhausted. Many oppose the attack. The Pentagon is not clear what they want it to achieve. The president is very determined. The statement that all options are on the table is based on a credible military threat, which comes alongside the preparations off the coast of Iran and in the skies.US President Donald Trump has combined nuclear diplomacy with a major military buildup. On Tuesday, US advisers Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff met Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in Geneva for three hours. Both sides said the talks “made progress,” but US officials remain sceptical about bridging key differences.However, US vice president JD Vance said, “The talks went well in some ways, but in other ways it was very clear that the president has set some red lines that the Iranians are not yet willing to actually acknowledge and work through.” He added that while the president wants a deal, diplomacy could have “reached its natural end.”According to Axios, the US military presence in the Middle East is substantial. Two aircraft carriers, a dozen warships, hundreds of fighter jets, and multiple air defence systems have been deployed, with more hardware en route. Open-source tracking shows over 150 cargo flights carrying weapons and ammunition, plus 50 fighter jets including F‑35s, F‑22s, and F‑16s, headed to the region.An unnamed Trump adviser told Axios: “Some people around him warn him against going to war with Iran, but I think there is 90% chance we see kinetic action in the next few weeks.”Two Israeli officials also told the news outlet that Israel is preparing for war “within days” and is pushing an operation targeting regime change. The report recalled that Iranian missiles in June 2025 killed 32 people and wounded over 3,000 in Holon. Likud MK Boaz Bismuth said: “There is no citizen of Israel who doesn’t ask himself several times a day ‘when will the Iran conflict happen?’ The public is prepared and the authorities are prepared. ”Meanwhile, Iran and Russia announced joint naval exercises in the Sea of Oman and northern Indian Ocean, while the Revolutionary Guards conducted drills near the strategic Strait of Hormuz, partially closing it for a few hours.","US President Donald Trump has combined nuclear diplomacy with a major military buildup.

NAGPUR: The Maharashtra Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) unearthed an alleged radicalisation network during raids at 21 locations spanning multiple districts, including Yavatmal and Ahilyanagaron Sunday.At the heart of the racket was a Nagpur-based grocer, who allegedly used a soccer club in Pusad, Yavatmal, as a front to indoctrinate youths into jihadi ideology. Originally from Pusad, he relocated to Jaffar Nagpur in Nagpur with his family, whose decades-old ties with radical outfits had placed them on the radar of intelligence agencies. His parents were members of a banned Islamic outfit and helped in clandestinely carrying out the operation, said top sources.During intensive searches in Yavatmal's Pusad and Ahilyanagar, ATS teams detained several youths for questioning. Investigators seized mobile phones, laptops, electronic gadgets, and other devices from their residences.Data, including phone records and social media accounts, was immediately sent to the forensic laboratory to recover deleted content and trace hidden communications.Preliminary findings indicate many of these youths, projected as footballers, maintained regular contact with cross-border radical outfits.Sources in intelligence agencies stated the suspects were allegedly involved in online discussions promoting anti-India sentiments and pro-jihadi ideology. ""Houses, personal associations, and digital footprints of all suspects are now under surveillance,"" an official stated.ATS detained the alleged mastermind and interrogated him on his activities and the full scope of the racket. Though the suspect was released, he continues to remain under scanner as investigations proceed.What makes this case particularly alarming is the modus operandi — the accused reportedly sent these individuals disguised as football team members to radicalisation camps and workshops in Kerala and West Bengal. Besides the football club, several youths and organisations related to radical groups were put under scanner.Expensive flight tickets point to a well-organised and financially supported network aimed at ideological grooming of vulnerable youths through targeted congregations and meetings, said ATS sources. ""This exposure highlighted a trend of exploiting recreational platforms to propagate extremist ideology,"" said an official.Sources stated that by analysing social media interactions, electronic evidence, and cross-border links, investigators are now mapping the entire network, including potential funding sources and wider associations. ""This development serves as a stark warning about hidden radicalisation efforts that can undermine national security,"" said an official associated with the raids.As the probe deepens, authorities are expected to uncover more layers of the conspiracy, reinforcing the need for continued vigilance against such deceptive operations in Maharashtra, said an official source.","The Maharashtra Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) unearthed an alleged radicalisation network during raids at 21 locations.

A case has been registered and further investigation is under way, police said.The incident comes months after the 2025 Delhi car blast near the Red Fort, in which 15 people were killed. Investigating agencies later confirmed that terror accused Umar was inside the car.The vehicle had been parked for nearly two hours at a nearby parking lot before it was driven out and detonated.A new report by the United Nations Security Council has blamed Jaish-e-Mohammed for carrying out a series of attacks, including linking the outfit to the car bombing near the Red Fort in New Delhi.The findings are part of the biannual assessment prepared by the Security Council’s monitoring team overseeing sanctions against Al-Qaeda and Islamic State affiliates. The report stated that the group was “reported to be linked to an attack on the Red Fort in New Delhi on 10 November that killed 15 people”.It further noted that one member state had informed the monitoring team that Jaish-e-Mohammed had claimed responsibility for multiple attacks. The outfit was also said to be connected to the November 10 strike in the capital.The report additionally highlighted that UN-designated terrorist Masood Azhar had, on October 8 last year, announced the creation of a women’s wing allegedly intended to support terrorist activities.","A man from Jammu and Kashmir has been arrested in Delhi for allegedly impersonating an officer of a central agency.

Who Raphaël Arnault is



How he came to power



Why the case is politically explosive



MP's assistant among 9 arrested over French far-right activist's killing • FRANCE 24 English

The bigger picture







A fatal street clash in Lyon has triggered one of the most explosive political controversies in France in recent years, placing a first-term lawmaker at the centre of national scrutiny.According to a Reuters report, a 23-year-old nationalist activist, Quentin Deranque, died after being brutally beaten during a confrontation between rival far-left and far-right groups earlier this month. Prosecutors opened a homicide investigation and police detained multiple suspects in connection with the assault.What transformed the incident into a political crisis was the trail leading into Parliament. Reuters reported that among those detained were individuals linked to the parliamentary office of Raphaël Arnault, a far-left MP from La France Insoumise. French media later identified one of them as a sitting parliamentary assistant and another as a former intern, with investigators examining whether one participated directly in the assault and whether another helped suspects evade police.Arnault himself is not accused of involvement in the violence.He has stated that he initiated procedures to dismiss a staff member following the arrest and said he would cooperate fully with investigators.The controversy has drawn intense attention because Arnault is not a conventional political figure. His rise reflects a broader shift in European politics in which militant grassroots activism increasingly intersects with electoral institutions.Before entering Parliament, Arnault was best known as a leader of a militant anti-fascist network based in Lyon. French authorities dissolved the group in 2023, citing risks to public order and repeated involvement in violent confrontations with far-right activists. Arnault also had prior convictions linked to protest-related violence, which became a major issue during his election campaign.This activist background is precisely why the Deranque case has become politically explosive. Critics argue that it highlights the blurred boundary between militant movements and institutional politics, while supporters maintain that anti-fascist activism is a legitimate political response to extremism.Arnault’s rise to Parliament was not the result of a gradual climb through party ranks but a consequence of a dramatic political moment in France.In 2024, French president Emmanuel Macron dissolved the National Assembly after his party suffered heavy losses in European elections. The sudden vote risked splitting the left-wing electorate and benefiting the far right.To prevent that outcome, multiple left-wing parties formed a broad electoral alliance known as the New Popular Front. Under this arrangement, constituencies were divided among alliance partners to ensure only one left-wing candidate contested each seat.Arnault was nominated by La France Insoumise in a constituency allocated to the party under this seat-sharing agreement. Because the entire left coalition backed him, he benefited from unified tactical voting in France’s two-round electoral system and won the seat despite controversy over his activist past.His election illustrated a wider trend across Europe, where political legitimacy increasingly flows not from traditional party hierarchies but from mobilisation capacity in grassroots movements.The Deranque killing has become a national flashpoint because it intersects with several deep tensions in French society.First, Lyon has long been a centre of ideological street clashes between anti-fascist networks and far-right nationalist groups. The city’s history of recurring confrontations gives the incident broader symbolic significance.Second, the arrests of individuals linked to a sitting MP’s office have intensified debate about whether militant activism can coexist with democratic institutions. Opponents argue that Arnault’s continued association with radical networks and his hiring choices reflect poor judgement, while allies say he is being targeted for political reasons.Third, the controversy is unfolding in an already polarised political climate following the 2024 snap elections, amplifying its national impact.Arnault’s political journey and the current controversy illustrate a structural transformation underway in European democracies. As protest movements increasingly convert street-level legitimacy into electoral power, unresolved ideological conflicts often migrate from public demonstrations into parliamentary politics.The ongoing investigation into Deranque’s death will determine individual criminal responsibility. Regardless of its outcome, however, the episode has already become a defining moment in France’s debate over activism, extremism and the limits of political legitimacy in a deeply polarised society.","MP's assistant among 9 arrested over French far-right activist's killing.

Who is Jay Bhattacharya?



Key facts about Jay Bhattacharya:



Born to Indian parents, he trained in both medicine and economics at Stanford University.

Holds an MD and a PhD in economics, with more than 170 peer-reviewed research publications.

Directed Stanford’s Center on the Demography and Economics of Health and Aging.

Served as a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research and worked at the RAND Corporation.

Co-authored the Great Barrington Declaration in 2020, which called for ending widespread Covid-19 lockdowns while focusing protection on older and vulnerable people.

while focusing protection on older and vulnerable people. Has been a longtime NIH grant recipient and member of multiple NIH review panels.





The director of the National Institutes of Health is poised to take on one of the most powerful roles in American public health. Dr Jay Bhattacharya, an Indian-origin physician and health economist, is set to become acting head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), according to reports first published by The New York Times and confirmed by administration officials.If formalised, the move would see Bhattacharya lead both the NIH and the CDC — two agencies central to the United States’ health and research infrastructure. President Donald Trump has not publicly announced the change, and the appointment is expected to be temporary until a permanent CDC director is nominated and confirmed by the Senate.The decision comes amid continued upheaval at the Atlanta-based CDC during Trump’s second term. Former director Susan Monarez was removed less than a month after her Senate confirmation. She later told lawmakers she had refused to approve changes to the childhood vaccination schedule without supporting scientific evidence. Her departure followed that of Jim O’Neill, who had been serving as acting director.Bhattacharya would become the third leader of the CDC in less than a year, as Health Secretary Robert F.Kennedy Jr. pursues a broader restructuring of federal health agencies.Jay Bhattacharya is a physician, economist and academic who took office as the 18th director of the National Institutes of Health on 1 April 2025. He was nominated by President Trump in November 2024 and confirmed by the Senate in March.Before joining government, he was a tenured professor at Stanford University, where his work focused on population ageing, chronic disease and the health of vulnerable communities.During the Covid-19 pandemic, Bhattacharya emerged as a prominent critic of school closures and blanket shutdowns. The Great Barrington Declaration drew fierce opposition from parts of the public health establishment, including former NIH director Francis Collins, who dismissed its authors as “fringe epidemiologists”. Conservatives, however, rallied behind Bhattacharya, viewing him as a voice against excessive restrictions.","Jay Bhattacharya, an Indian-origin physician and health economist, is set to become acting head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), according to reports.

Pentagon’s position



OpenAI and Google agreed to cooperate with Pentagon



AI giant Anthropic is locked in a dispute with the US Department of Defense (DOD) over how its artificial intelligence models should be deployed. As reported by CNBC, a Pentagon spokesperson told the publication that the company’s $200 million contact with the agency is now ‘under review’. Presently, Anthropic is the only AI company with models running on classified military networks, offering customised tools to national security customers.Anthropic has pushed back against broad military use, seeking assurances that its AI will not be deployed for autonomous weapons or to spy on Americans. As per the report a spokesperson of the company said that Anthropic is having ‘productive conversations, in good faith’ with the Pentagon, emphasising that it remains committed to supporting US national security while ensuring ethical safeguards.The DOD, however, insists on using Anthropic’s models for ‘all lawful use cases’ without restriction. “If any one company doesn’t want to accommodate that, that’s a problem for us,” said Emil Michael, undersecretary of defense for research and engineering. He warned that limitations could prevent the military from deploying AI in urgent situations.The dispute has drawn political attention. David Sacks, serving as the administration’s AI and crypto czar, accused Anthropic of promoting “woke AI” by resisting certain military applications.The Trump administration has publicly criticized the company in recent months, adding to tensions.Anthropic’s rivals OpenAI and Google also received Pentagon contracts worth up to $200 million last year. Unlike Anthropic, they agreed to allow the DOD to use their models for all lawful purposes, at least within unclassified systems. One company even permitted use across all systems, according to a senior defense official.If Anthropic refuses to comply, the Pentagon could designate it a “supply chain risk”, a label typically reserved for foreign adversaries. Such a move would force vendors and contractors to certify they do not use Anthropic’s models, dealing a major blow to the startup.","Anthropic is the only AI company with models running on classified military networks.

Lake Tahoe avalanche: Skiers ignored warnings? 10 missing after Castle Peak slide amidst severe winter storm in US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/lake-tahoe-avalanche-10-skiers-missing-after-castle-peak-slide-amidst-severe-winter-storm-in-us/articleshow/128497021.cms,"Skiers Ignored Avalanche Warnings? Tragedy Strikes Lake Tahoe Backcountry

Lake Tahoe rescue struggle amid extreme conditions

Season of extremes: A deadly winter across California mountains

Why Lake Tahoe avalanche has become national news

Local Reddit commenters and community members have echoed concern about the dangerous backcountry conditions, noting how the winter snow, while ecologically beneficial, has created a context where avalanche risk remains exceptionally high throughout the Sierra

Nevada

.

Human toll and broader impacts of Lake Tahoe avalanche

As rescue operations continue, the human toll remains uncertain. Families of the missing skiers are awaiting updates, while survivors brace for extraction amid brutal cold and wind. The Nevada County Sheriff’s Office, along with multiple county and state agencies, continues to coordinate efforts, emphasizing that search strategies are complicated by terrain and ongoing weather hazards.

This tragedy serves as a stark reminder of both the allure and the hazards of winter sports in rugged wilderness areas, a powerful combination of natural beauty and serious risk that draws adventurers from across the country. A massive avalanche near Lake Tahoe struck on February 17, 2026, leaving 10 skiers missing and six found alive amid severe storm conditions. The incident occurred during an intense winter storm in the Sierra Nevada that brought heavy snow and high avalanche danger warnings.

Rescue crews are battling whiteout conditions, high winds and avalanche hazards as they attempt to reach survivors and locate the missing. This event caps a deeply dangerous winter season in the region, with past fatalities and multiple hazard warnings underscoring the risks faced by backcountry adventurers and locals alike. The Lake Tahoe avalanche and extreme winter conditions have reignited broader debates about backcountry skiing safety, storm preparedness and weather-related risk management in mountain regions, capturing national attention well beyond California.





A massive avalanche struck the Castle Peak area north of Lake Tahoe on Tuesday, February 17, 2026, leaving at least 10 backcountry skiers missing and forcing rescuers to race against time and worsening weather to reach survivors trapped deep in the Sierra Nevada snow . The incident, which occurred around 11:30 am local time, occurred in the midst of a powerful and long-duration winter storm that has brought heavy snowfall, hurricane-force winds and whiteout conditions to California’s high elevations.The group, 16 skiers comprised of four guides and 12 clients on a three-day backcountry ski tour, was swept up by the avalanche at about 8,200 feet elevation near Frog Lake huts, situated northwest of Truckee. Rescue efforts managed to locate six survivors who were alive but awaiting extraction, while 10 others remain unaccounted for, feared buried under vast depths of newly accumulated snow.Emergency response teams, including specialised search and rescue ski units, snowcats and snowmobile crews, have been battling blizzard-like conditions to reach the scene. Heavy snow and shifting winds have reduced visibility, blocked access routes and made travel perilous even for trained responders. Authorities have asked survivors who are sheltering on site to stay put as crews chart a cautious path through the avalanche terrain.The Sierra Avalanche Center had issued a “high avalanche danger” warning just hours before the incident, highlighting unstable snowpack layers and rapidly accumulating snowfall, with forecasts of up to 8 feet of snow in parts of the range, making conditions extremely dangerous outside controlled resort terrains.Nearby ski resorts, such as those around Lake Tahoe, completely or partially closed operations due to the storm, recognising that avalanche mitigation systems in managed resort environments cannot eliminate the extremely high risk in open backcountry zones.This is far from an isolated winter mishap; the Lake Tahoe avalanche caps what many have already described as one of the deadliest and most severe winter seasons in recent years for California’s mountains. In Mammoth Mountain and other popular ski areas, multiple fatalities and serious injuries have occurred from falls and snow instability in recent weeks, including at least two separate deaths at Northstar California Resort within days of one another.California’s rugged terrain has, in multiple instances this winter, turned treacherous under the stress of heavy snow and storm conditions. State officials and safety experts have repeatedly warned that trekking or skiing in unmonitored backcountry areas during peak storm activity can be extremely dangerous, especially where snowpacks have weak internal layers primed for slides.What sets this disaster apart and why it has captured widespread media attention, is partly its scale and partly its timing. Avalanches often affect individuals or small parties but the Castle Peak incident involved an organised group with guides, making it a rare and sobering reminder of backcountry risks for even experienced outdoor adventurers. This avalanche occurred amid a significant winter storm that has snarled roads, shut down highways such as Interstate 80 and dumped dozens of inches of snow across the region, significantly increasing avalanche hazard.Rescuers are contending not just with snow and cold but with avalanche danger that persists even after the initial slide. Blizzard conditions force careful, slow movement toward survivors, while unstable layers of snow could spark further slides. Winter storm forecasters and avalanche experts have underscored that such events are not only possible but expected when rapid accumulation of snowfall combines with strong winds and weak snowpack layers.In backcountry terrain, areas beyond marked and controlled resort boundaries, the risk can increase dramatically, particularly in the middle of a storm cycle when layers of fresh snow don’t have time to bond with older snow. This context, a dynamic snowpack, heavy storm loading and gusty winds, makes conditions far more unpredictable and inherently more dangerous compared to groomed runs inside ski resorts.The broader Lake Tahoe region, including communities spanning from Truckee to Soda Springs, has been experiencing record or near-record snow totals. Local weather services have repeatedly warned residents and travellers to avoid unnecessary travel and to be aware that highways like Interstate 80 and mountain passes are subject to closure and hazardous driving conditions due to spinouts and blocked roads.","A massive avalanche near Lake Tahoe struck on February 17, 2026, leaving 10 skiers missing and six found alive.

Indian-origin man cleared after 43yrs in jail for murder denied bail in deportation fight,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/indian-origin-man-cleared-after-43yrs-in-jail-for-murder-denied-bail-in-deportation-fight/articleshow/128535796.cms,"AP file photo

PHILADELPHIA:





An Indian-origin man who spent 43 years in prison before his murder conviction was overturned — only to be taken straight into immigration custody — was denied bail on Tuesday while he fights deportation. Subramanyam Vedam, 64, will remain in custody while he appeals a 1999 deportation order. The Board of Immigration Appeals agreed this month to hear his appeal based on what it called exceptional circumstances.The Trump administration had initially pursued a quick deportation and moved Vedam to a detention centre in Louisiana last fall, before two separate courts intervened.Vedam’s lawyer argued on Tuesday that he would have likely been spared deportation and become a citizen if not for the murder case, given immigration laws in place at the time. Vedam would have left prison on a drug charge by 1992, lawyer Ava Benach said. “It was delivery of LSD on a very small scale. This is not importing tonnes of cocaine,” Benach said. “He is not a danger to the community. We are talking about offences that occurred over 40 years ago. ”In Aug, a Pennsylvania judge threw out Vedam’s murder conviction in the 1980 death of a college friend, based on ballistics evidence that prosecutors hadn’t disclosed during his two trials.Supporters listening in remotely to the bail hearing included a Centre County prosecutor and the mayor of State College, where Vedam’s late father was a professor at Penn State University, Benach said.Immigration Judge Tamar Wilson, sitting in Elizabeth, New Jersey, said she believes detention to be mandatory given the felony drug conviction. Alternatively, she agreed with department of homeland security officials who said he remains a safety risk. “The fact he’s been a ‘model prisoner’ does not suggest that out in the general public he’s going to be safe,” Wilson said. It’s not yet clear whether Wilson or another judge will hear the merits of the deportation case. No hearings have yet been scheduled.“Subu is nothing if not resilient, and we’re resolved to emulate the example he sets for us by focusing on the next step in his fight for freedom. We continue to believe his immigration case is strong...,” said his sister, Saraswathi. Vedam had come to the US legally from India when he was 9 months old","Subramanyam Vedam, 64, will remain in custody while he appeals a 1999 deportation order.

US-Iran War Outcome Decided? Trump Deploys 'Radar-Blinding' Growler In Middle East





US President Donald Trump on Wednesday said the UK should not “give away” the strategically vital Diego Garcia base in the Indian Ocean, a joint US-UK facility, arguing it could be ""crucial"" if the United States launches military action against Iran. His remarks came as he reportedly weighs potential strikes on Iran’s clerical leadership.The warning followed renewed backing from the US State Department for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s agreement to transfer sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius. Under the proposed arrangement, Britain would lease the base, which shares its name with the Diego Garcia island, the largest in the archipelago, for 100 years.Posting on his Truth Social, Trump urged Starmer not to proceed with what the Republican described as a “tenuous” century-long lease, insisting the territory should remain under British control. He argued that relinquishing it would ""damage"" Britain, a key US ally, and stressed that it must ""stay strong” in the face of ""internal and external pressures.""Trump’s post came as his envoys held fresh negotiations with Iran, pressing Tehran to make significant concessions, particularly regarding its nuclear program.He suggested that if talks fail, Washington might need access to both Diego Garcia and RAF Fairford — a US air base in England — to counter what he called potential threats from the Islamic Republic. He also voiced concern about possible attacks targeting the United Kingdom and other allied nations.Britain retained control of the Chagos Islands after Mauritius gained independence in the 1960s, forcibly removing thousands of residents who have since pursued compensation through legal challenges. Trump dismissed those claims as unfounded.On Tuesday, the State Department announced upcoming talks with Mauritius focused on maintaining the military base and reiterated America's support for Britain’s decision to proceed with the agreement.When asked about the apparent contradiction between Trump’s post and official US policy, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump’s statement should be regarded as the administration’s position.The episode reflects another shift in Trump’s stance. After the deal was first reached by Starmer’s Labour government, secretary of state Marco Rubio called it “historic.” Trump later criticised it as an “act of GREAT STUPIDITY,” linking it to his argument that the United States should take control of Greenland from Denmark. He subsequently said he accepted the agreement following discussions with Starmer, a position he now appears to have reversed.","US President Donald Trump said the UK should not “give away” the strategically vital Diego Garcia base in the Indian Ocean.

Does Trump have a secret 'alien speech'? Karoline Leavitt comments on Lara Trump's viral claim,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/does-trump-have-a-secret-alien-speech-karoline-leavitt-comments-on-lara-trumps-viral-claim/articleshow/128526632.cms,"



In a press briefing on Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked if President Trump believes aliens are ""real"" after his daughter-in-law claimed that the 79-year-old leader had a speech ready on the subject.Newsmax's Mike Carter asked the pregnant MAGA leader about former US President Barack Obama's claims on aliens being ""real"" and Lara Trump's revelation of Trump having a ready opinion on the same.“President Barack Obama, Karoline, was recently asked if aliens are real. He says they’re real, but he hasn’t seen them. President’s daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, told Miranda Devine of the New York Post that the president has a prepared speech on this issue that he plans to deliver at the right time. Is that true, and does the Trump administration believe aliens are real?” he asked.Leavitt responded that any such speech speed would be ""personally"" exciting to her as well as to the reporters and Obama. Though, she added that she would have to check with the speech writing team on the same. “Well, a speech on aliens would be news to me. That sounds very exciting though. I’ll have to check in with our speechwriting team.And that would be of great interest to me personally, and I’m sure all of you in this room, and apparently former President Obama too. So we’ll keep you posted on that,” she said.Lara Trump, wife of Eric Trump, the president's third child, recently appeared on The New York Post's Pod Force One podcast, hosted by Miranda Devine and suggested that her father-in-law had something prepared about aliens, but was waiting for the right moment.“What’s kind of funny is we’ve kind of asked my father-in-law about this cause we’re like, ‘Well, what do you know?...’” she said on the episode published Wednesday.She added that when the couple pressed Trump on the topic of extraterrestrials he didn't comment much and ""played a little coy.""“I have just heard kind of around that he’s actually said, my father-in-law has actually said it, that there is some speech that he has, that I guess at the right time...I don’t know what the right time is...that he is going to break out and talk about, and it has to do with maybe some sort of extraterrestrial life, so to speak,” Lara said.Lara's buzz-making claim follows a viral comment by former US President Barack Obama. In a recent appearance on Brian Tyler Cohen's podcast, No Lie, the former President was asked if aliens were ""real"" to which he replied positively. “They’re real, but I haven’t seen them, and they’re not being kept in, what is it? There’s no underground facility, unless there’s this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States. ”While he later clarified that the answer was made with the ""spirit of the speed round"" and he saw ""no evidence"" of extraterrestrials during his presidency, he also stated that ""statistically"" the ""odds are good.""Area 51, a secretive military installation in southern Nevada has long been surrounded by speculations of hiding evidence of alien life. Additionally, a secretly made documentary 'The Age of Disclosure' directed by Dan Farah also amped up the conspiracy theories around the subject, claiming an 80-year global cover-up of non-human intelligence.In the trailer for the documentary, Secretary of State and Trump ally, Marco Rubio claimed unidentified flying objects (UFOs) have been spotted over restricted US nuclear facilities, with information so classified that even presidents are notified on a need-to-know basis.""There had been reports of something operating in the airspace over restricted nuclear facilities"" that wasn't American-made, said Rubio in the clip. He added that the intelligence ""keeps me up at night,"" and whistleblowers are putting their lives on the line by coming forward.","Lara Trump, the president's daughter-in-law, said on a podcast that the president has a speech ready on the subject.

Trump’s name on US airports soon? Family business seeks trademark rights,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-name-on-us-airports-soon-family-business-seeks-trademark-rights/articleshow/128525628.cms,"Florida Airport renaming sparks filing

‘Completely unprecedented’: Trademark expert

Licensing clause added to Florida bill

Breaking with tradition

Wider naming push





In a move that experts are calling unprecedented, the Trump Organization has filed trademark applications to secure exclusive rights to use President Donald Trump’s name for airports and related services, even as it insists there is no plan to charge a fee for a proposed renaming in Florida, the Associated Press reported.The filings, submitted through a family-owned entity called DTTM Operations to the US Patent and Trademark Office, seek rights over three names: “President Donald J. Trump International Airport,” “Donald J. Trump International Airport,” and “DJT.”The applications extend beyond airport signage to cover a wide range of goods and services typically found at airports, from shuttle buses and flight suits to umbrellas and travel bags.The trademark applications come amid political debate in Florida over a state bill proposing that Palm Beach International Airport be renamed in honour of Trump. The airport is located near his Mar-a-Lago residence.According to the Trump Organization, the filings were triggered by the Florida legislation. The company maintains that it does not intend to profit from the proposed renaming.“To be clear, the President and his family will not receive any royalty, licensing fee, or financial consideration whatsoever from the proposed airport renaming,” the organization said in a statement.However, it did not clarify whether it would seek royalties if other airports adopted the Trump name in the future or if it would monetize merchandise covered under the trademark filings.The filings were first flagged by trademark attorney Josh Gerben, founder of Gerben IP, who described them as unlike anything he has seen before.“While presidents and public officials have had landmarks named in their honour, a sitting president’s private company has never in the history of the United States sought trademark rights in advance of such naming,” Gerben wrote in a blog post. He added that the move is “completely unprecedented.”Gerben also noted that, traditionally, naming rights for airports are honorary and not designed for financial gain. Most major US airports — including Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport and Harry Reid International Airport — are publicly owned and operated by state or local authorities, which typically control and protect their trademarks.A Florida House bill to rename Palm Beach International Airport recently advanced in the state legislature. Notably, amendments added in recent weeks would require a licensing agreement from the Trump Organization allowing Palm Beach County to use the president’s name.Earlier drafts of the bill reportedly did not include such a requirement. According to reports, renaming the airport could cost an estimated USD 5.5 million.The Trump Organization has defended its move, claiming the Trump name is “the most infringed trademark in the world” and that the applications are aimed at preventing misuse by “bad actors.” That claim could not be independently verified.If approved, Trump would join a list of former presidents with airports named in their honour, but far sooner than most. Historically, US presidents have had to wait years after leaving office, or until after their death, before such tributes were made.For example, Bill Clinton waited 11 years after leaving office, Ronald Reagan nine years, and Gerald Ford 22 years. John F. Kennedy had New York’s major airport renamed just one month after his assassination.The airport proposal is part of a broader trend of institutions and projects being linked to Trump’s name. In recent months, venues and infrastructure proposals, including Dulles International Airport and New York’s Penn Station — have reportedly been floated as candidates for renaming.Last month, Trump reportedly suggested to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer that federal infrastructure funding could be tied to renaming projects. Schumer rejected the idea.While the Trump Organization says the filings are purely defensive, legal observers say unanswered questions remain, including why a private company, rather than a public airport authority, is seeking to control the trademark.",The Trump Organization has filed trademark applications to secure exclusive rights to use President Donald Trump's name for airports and related services.

'It overtook them rather quickly'

(With AP inputs)





Crews recovered the bodies of eight backcountry skiers and continued searching for one missing after an avalanche near California's Lake Tahoe, authorities said on Wednesday, calling it the ""deadliest"" US avalanche in nearly 50 years.According to Shannan Moon, sheriff of Nevada County, the mission has shifted from rescue to recovery. Six others from the guided three-day trip were rescued on Tuesday in the Sierra Nevada mountains during a powerful winter storm.All the skiers carried emergency beacons, though it was unclear whether they had avalanche air bags. The six survivors sheltered in place in below-freezing temperatures and located three of the deceased. Rescuers reached them by snowcat to within 2 miles, then skied in to avoid triggering another slide. One survivor remained hospitalized Wednesday, Moon added.“Someone saw the avalanche, yelled avalanche, and it overtook them rather quickly,” said Capt. Russell Greene of the sheriff’s office. The eight victims were found close together; three were guides. Their bodies have not yet been removed due to dangerous conditions.The avalanche is the deadliest in the US since 1981, when 11 climbers died on Mount Rainier in Washington. An average of 25 to 30 people die in America in avalanches each winter, according to the National Avalanche Center.","The avalanche is the deadliest in the US since 1981, when 11 climbers died on Mount Rainier in Washington.

Minnesota middle school faces backlash over lesson claiming ICE used ‘tricky & violent tactics’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/minnesota-school-taught-eighth-graders-that-ice-used-tricky-violent-tactics-during-geography-lesson/articleshow/128522175.cms,"



A Minnesota middle school taught eighth-graders that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers were using “tricky & violent tactics” to harass and arrest thousands of “legal immigrants,” according to documents released this week by a conservative education group.Defending Education published excerpts from a PowerPoint slideshow that showed students at Hermantown Middle School outside Duluth were lectured about ICE during a geography lesson and given a primer on why “people think the Ice [sic] agents have ‘gone too far’.”The response on the same slide stated: “Some use tricky & violent tactics. 22 people died in ICE custody so far in 2025. Not filing paperwork to track arrests. Wearing masks to hide identities.”A slide listed ways people think ICE agents have ""gone too far,"" including ""tricky & violent tactics,"" 22 deaths in custody, not filing proper paperwork, wearing masks, and people posing as agents to kidnap/hurt others, New York Post reported.“ICE has Arrested &/or harassed thousands of LEGAL immigrants and 170 US citizens — including being dragged, tackled, beaten, tased and shot,” another slide read.The class teacher encouraged students to watch videos of “inhumane” migrant detention centers and other footage of ICE operations in order to receive extra credit.A concerned parent shared the materials with the conservative organisation, but Hermantown’s principal pushed back in a now-public email, arguing that the lesson plan aligned with Minnesota education standards.“All of our social studies classes have a current events component to them and this information is part of the MN standards in geography,” wrote the school official, whose name was redacted from the message.It was unclear whether the PowerPoint also covered the arrests of thousands of convicted criminals who had been illegally residing in Minnesota.One slide also noted the Trump administration was shelling out “$170 billion taxpayer dollars to hire 20,000+ additional I.C.E. agents to find and deport them.”“Why don’t undocumented immigrants just apply to come here legally?” another slide asked, before answering, “there aren’t enough ‘slots.’”“Our staff strive to share both viewpoints on an issue,” Hermantown Community Schools Superintendent Wayne Whitwam told The Post in a statement. “[Defending Education] is showing one side, but for example doesn’t include a pro-ICE video shared by the same teacher.”“ICE has Arrested &/or harassed thousands of LEGAL immigrants and 170 U.S. citizens – including being dragged, tackled, beaten, tased and shot,” one PowerPoint slide read.Whitwam declined to share any “pro-ICE” content from the lesson, saying in an email: “I don’t want to feed this story.”The superintendent did share guidelines from the Minnesota Association of School Administrators, which included admonitions to focus on “education, not advocacy,” “respect all viewpoints,” “support civil discourse,” and “know your role.”Instructors were also advised not to engage in political debate with students or use the classroom for “personal political messages” or to “display partisan materials.”“It’s bad enough that this biased lesson is replete with falsehoods — but [for] the school principal to defend such garbage truly adds insult to injury,” said Nicole Neily, the founder and president of Defending Education, in a statement.“Students are being force-fed ideological propaganda during finite lesson time (when they’re not being encouraged by activist teachers to walk out of their classrooms, that is) and told what to think, rather than how to think. It’s little wonder that families are fleeing the public education system in droves.”President Trump’s border czar Tom Homan announced the end of a federal surge of thousands of immigration officers to Minnesota earlier this month, after fatal shootings of two anti-ICE demonstrators forced a shake-up.Operation Metro Surge recorded more than 4,000 arrests and the recovery of 3,364 unaccompanied migrant children, said Homan, who claimed the Biden administration had stopped even “looking for” the lost kids.Homan highlighted how the arrests included an illegal immigrant convicted of raping a child under the age of 14, as well as other “criminal aliens” convicted of sexual misconduct and violence.The drawdown announced by Homan followed weeks of clashes between the feds and far-left demonstrators, and rhetorical spats between Democratic officials and the Trump administration, in the Twin Cities over deportations.The controversy made international headlines Jan. 7 when Renee Good, 37, was shot and killed by an ICE officer as she accelerated her car in his direction after being stopped and asked to exit the vehicle.Alex Pretti, also 37, was gunned down by Border Patrol and Customs and Border Protection agents Jan. 24 after refusing to clear a roadway and getting into a “struggle” while carrying a loaded pistol.Both killings were under federal investigation, though Minnesota officials also called for state probes.Other Department of Homeland Security officers were also probed for misconduct. Two were put on administrative leave in February after giving false statements to a federal court about a migrant-involved shooting incident Jan. 14 in Minneapolis.Good and Pretti were participants in “ICE Watch” groups that tracked immigration officers to flag when arrests were being made.ICE Watch proponents maintained they were exercising their right as “legal observers” and emphasised they did not encourage confrontation with law enforcement.The Trump administration and Republicans criticised such groups’ tactics for disrupting law enforcement and put out statistics showing an alarming rise in anti-ICE violence, assaults on officers and destruction of federal property.","A Minnesota middle school taught eighth-graders that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers were using “tricky & violent tactics” to harass and arrest thousands of “legal immigrants,” according to documents released this week by a conservative education group.

Is Donald Trump eyeing social media ban for teens? Daughter-in-law Lara says he’s shown ‘keen interest’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/is-donald-trump-eyeing-social-media-ban-for-teens-daughter-in-law-lara-says-hes-shown-keen-interest/articleshow/128523371.cms,"Global momentum for teen social media limits





Amid rising global push to regulate online platforms for minors due to concerns over addictive algorithms, online bullying and mental health risks, US President Donald Trump has shown a keen “interest” in the idea of restricting social media access for teenagers, his daughter-in-law Lara Trump has revealed.Speaking on the New York Post podcast, Lara Trump said she had discussed research on the psychological effects of social media with the US President and pointed to regulatory moves in countries such as Australia and France.“I see things like what has happened in Australia and what has happened in France, where you have a regulatory body saying, ‘We’re going to wait until these kids are at least a little bit older, 15, 16 years old, in order to at least process a little more what they’re doing in the social media space before they get online,” she told host Miranda Devine on the New York Post podcast.“And I personally would be so in favour of that.”Lara Trump, who is married to Eric Trump and hosts My View on Fox News, said she is generally wary of government overreach but would support limited action in this area.“I’m not much of one for regulating things, but I would be very happy with a little bit of regulation in this space, just personally as a parent,” she said.She added that she had briefed the President on studies linking screen use to dopamine and oxytocin spikes in children.“When I talk to him about the studies that I’ve read and the way that a kid looks at a screen and their dopamine and their oxytocin and all these feel-good chemicals are firing, and then you take the screen away, and those all go away,” she said, “well, how are they ever going to get back to that in just regular life without a screen? They almost don’t.”According to Lara Trump, the President has shown strong curiosity about the issue, particularly as concerns grow about addictive algorithms and online harms.The debate comes as several countries tighten rules for younger users. In 2024, Australia approved landmark legislation setting 16 as the minimum age for holding a social media account, with mandatory age verification and penalties for non-compliant platforms.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the move would make “an enormous difference” in safeguarding children.France now requires parental consent for users under 15 and has examined stronger enforcement tools.In the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Keir Starmer has indicated support for tougher online safety rules, including potential age thresholds for social media use.Trump’s executive actions on social media focused largely on platform moderation and alleged censorship. Ironically, social media has also been central to his political communication strategy, including the launch of Truth Social after he was barred from Twitter (now X) following the January 6, 2021 Capitol attack.However, there is no formal White House proposal yet to ban social media for teens nationwide.","US President Donald Trump has shown a keen ‘interest’ in the idea of restricting social media access for teenagers, his daughter-in-law Lara Trump has revealed.
