Captain Shiv Kumar had outlined the Indian military's initial response during the early stages of Operation Sindoor while speaking at a seminar hosted by an Indonesian university.In a statement posted on X, the embassy clarified that the officer’s remarks were “quoted out of context” and that media coverage had misrepresented the intent and focus of the presentation.“We have seen media reports regarding a presentation made by India's defence attaché to Indonesia at a seminar. His remarks have been quoted out of context, and the media reports are a misrepresentation of the intention and thrust of the presentation made by the speaker,” the embassy said.According to the clarification, the presentation highlighted a key tenet of India’s civil-military structure, that the Indian Armed Forces operate under the authority of civilian political leadership. It pointedly noted this contrasts with practices in “some other countries in our neighbourhood”.The embassy further said that the officer had referred to Operation Sindoor, explaining that the objective was to target terrorist infrastructure, and that India’s military response was non-escalatory.Earlier in the day, Congress had cited the reported comments of India's defence attache to Indonesia and accused the government of having ""misled"" the country.The party also asked why is Prime Minister Narendra Modi ""refusing"" to preside over an all-party meeting to take the Opposition into confidence and why has the demand for a special session of Parliament been rejected.","The Indian Embassy in Indonesia on Sunday clarified that media reports had ""quoted out of context"" remarks made by Defence Attaché Captain Shiv Kumar.

Incident caused by ‘abysmal failure’ of crowd mgmt: Naveen

Bhubaneswar: A pre-dawn stampede during Rath Yatra festivities in Odisha's temple town Puri left three devotees dead and dozens injured Sunday as over 20,000 people crowded into a space meant for less than a third of that number.The dead were identified as Premakanta Mohanty, 78, a retired state govt employee from Bhubaneswar; homemaker Basanti Sahu, 42, from Khurda; and Prabhati Das, 52, of Balianta in Bhubaneswar.They had come with families for ""darshan"" of Lord Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra atop chariots before the sibling deities entered Gundicha temple on the third day of the annual festival. The chariots were parked outside the temple, drawing massive crowds that overwhelmed barriers.Eyewitnesses attributed the chaos to poor planning and inadequate crowd control measures. They said the surge began as two trucks carrying wooden ladders for the chariots entered the dense crowd around 4am.""The narrow congregation site, combined with insufficient police presence and scattered palm log ladders near the chariots, resulted in the stampede,"" eyewitness Chinmay Patra said.CM Mohan Charan Majhi ordered a probe led by development commissioner Anu Garg and announced compensation of Rs 25 lakh for each victim's family.He called the lapses ""unforgivable"" and transferred Puri district collector S S Swain and SP Vinit Agrawal. DCP-ranked officer V P Pati and commandant Ajay Kumar Padhi were suspended for negligence.Bhubaneswar: Sunday's stampede at Puri in BJP-governed Odisha spotlighted failure of police's crowd control measures. Opposition BJD and Congress attributed the tragedy to govt's incompetence and ""favour"" shown to BJP workers to gather around the chariots.While there was a delay on Friday due to a crowd surge, the chariot-pulling ceremony eventually went off smoothly that day and Saturday with over 12 lakh devotees. But alleged mismanagement of a smaller gathering of 5,000-6,000 near Gundicha Temple led to the stampede Sunday.""The location in front of Gundicha Temple can accommodate a maximum of 5,000-6,000 devotees. Stampedes can occur when chariots are moving. However, tragedy struck before stationary chariots, a first in history,"" said Binayak Dasmohapatra, a senior servitor of Jagannath Temple.Police had announced deployment of 275 AI-enabled cameras and drones for real-time crowd monitoring as part of the security and traffic measures. At least two IPS officers were assigned to oversee 5 companies of RAF, 6 SP-rank officers, 7 ASPs, 24 DSPs, 42 inspectors, 189 SIs/ASIs, 12 havildars, 110 home guards and 52 platoons of state police. Despite this, security experts and devotees criticised police for failing to anticipate the massive weekend crowd. "" I suspect the personnel lowered their guard after Friday and Saturday, and did not take any preemptive measure for the remaining days of the festival,"" said Sahadeb Mohanty, a retired DSP.Leader of opposition and BJD chief Naveen Patnaik posted on X, ""While I refrain from accusing govt of criminal negligence, their blatant callousness undeniably contributed to this tragedy.""State Congress president Bhakta Charan Das claimed the entire arrangement was ""VVIP and BJP worker-centric"".Govt pushed back against the allegations, pointing out that action had been taken against negligent officers and more would follow after ongoing inquiries.""Senior police officers are on the spot to ensure comprehensive crowd control measures,"" law minister Prithiviraj Harichandan said.Prabhati, one of the victims, had travelled in a group of seven.Her mother Binodini Panda said: “Thousands pushed through, walking over people. Some people lifted me and some others, but my daughter remained trapped. By the time we managed to reach her, she was gone.”According to Basanti’s husband Dilip Kumar Sahu, the crowd surged at dawn. “People started falling, including us. We were trampled. My wife got trapped. We pulled her out and waited for nearly an hour for an ambulance. She was declared dead at the hospital.”Opposition politicians blamed BJP-led govt for security failures. Former CM Naveen Patnaik of BJD called it an “abysmal failure” of crowd management. Congress MP Rahul Gandhi said “no lapses in this responsibility are acceptable”.Undeterred, thousands of devotees continued gathering for darshan of the deities through the day. “We are saddened by the tragedy but not scared. Our faith is stronger than our fear,” said Saudamini Sarangi, 65, from Cuttack.“There was chaos for about an hour but then normalcy returned quickly. We offered prayers smoothly afterward,” said Sovan Pattnaik of Bhubaneswar.Police deployed reinforcements, set up barricades and implemented multiple queue systems. “We appealed to people not to spread rumours. Many were taking photos in the crowd, adding to the challenge,” said DGP YB Khurania. The festival continues through July 8.","Three dead and dozens injured in stampede during Rath Yatra festivities in Odisha's temple town Puri.

Politics aside, Internet is debating who is more American.

'Nothing can be more wrong'



'Be Zohran Mamdani, not a Vivek Ramaswamy'



Debate over who's more American







Indian-Americans are divided over Zohran Mamdani, the NYC mayoral candidate of Indian-origin, and Vivek Ramaswamy , the Indian-origin GOP leader who is a Guv candidate of Ohio. While Ramaswamy fell out of MAGA favor after his rant against American culture, Republicans have no love for Mamdani -- but the Indian-American community feels there should be no comparison between Vivek Ramaswamy and Zohran Mamdani. Mamdani fans think Mamdani is what Vivek Ramaswamy could not become, while Ramaswamy fans think Mamdani has not achieved anything to be compared to Ramaswamy -- one of the youngest billionaires in the US.Their only point of comparison is their Indian origin, though none of them was born in India. Ramaswamy was born in Cincinnati, Ohio; Mamdani was born in Uganda.Dr Lavanya Vemsani, author and professor, said some far left handles on social media are comparing Vivek Ramaswamy with Mamdani but nothing can be more wrong. ""Vivek is a successful businessman and well liked Republican candidate running for the Governor of an important state, Ohio. Zohran is running as a mayor and doesn’t really have any career accomplishments to show other than a mediocre music gig and working for his mom. He is just having fun running and creating fake larger-than-life-projection of himself. This is just a self-fulfilling story for Zohran than anything purposeful for New Yorkers,"" Dr Vemsani posted on X.""Zohran Mamdani ran a very clever campaign while Vivek Ramaswamy destroyed his career with a tweet,"" one wrote.""Zohran Mamdani is what everyone thought Vivek Ramaswamy would be last year,"" another wrote.One particular post fawning over Mamdani said: ""Oh the Indian origin kids of America, when given a choice, be Zohran Mamdani. Not a Vivek Ramswamy.""Some people put them in the same bracket and said both of them should be deported. ""We shouldn’t support either, but Mamdani is also a communist who explicitly identifies as anti-White. His religion and race are not the only factors to mention. Vivek is an anchor-baby – both he and Mamdani must be deported IMMEDIATELY,"" one wrote.Another simultaneous debate that took off on X was who is more American between Zohran Mamdani and Vivek Ramaswamy. People pointed out that though Vivek Ramaswamy has America First ideals, Mamdani seems more assimilated in American culture.","Indian-Americans are divided over Zohran Mamdani, the NYC mayoral candidate of Indian-origin, and Vivek Ramaswamy, the Indian- origin GOP leader who is a Guv candidate of Ohio.

"Kolkata college rape: TMC rift widens; Mahua Moitra’s rebuke, Kalyan Banerjee’s retort shake party unity",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kolkata-law-college-gnag-rape-case-tmc-rift-widens-mahua-moitras-rebuke-kalyan-banerjees-retort-shake-party-unity/articleshow/122150162.cms,"Internal conflict within Trinamool Congress intensified after MP Kalyan Banerjee attacked colleague Mahua Moitra for criticizing his and MLA Madan Mitra's remarks regarding a Kolkata gang-rape case.





NEW DELHI: The fault lines within Trinamool Congress sharpened on Sunday as senior MP Kalyan Banerjee launched a personal attack on party colleague Mahua Moitra after she publicly condemned “misogynistic” remarks made by him and MLA Madan Mitra in connection with the alleged gang-rape of a law college student in Kolkata.On Sunday, the TMC issued a showcause notice to Kamarhati MLA Madan Mitra and censured Serampore MP Kalyan Banerjee over their controversial remarks on the June 25 assault that took place within the college premises.Party president Subrata Bakshi asked Mitra to respond within three days, accusing him of making “unsolicited, unnecessary, and insensitive” comments that hurt the party’s image.While Mitra had advised girls not to trust known persons on college holidays — a statement widely criticised as victim-blaming — Banerjee triggered a fresh row by questioning how the government could prevent incidents where “a friend rapes another friend”.Though both leaders attempted to explain or roll back their comments, what followed was a rare public showdown.Banerjee lashed out at MP Mahua Moitra after she posted on X, “Misogyny in India cuts across party lines. What differentiates TMC is that we condemn such disgusting comments no matter who makes them.” Banerjee hit back, dragging Moitra’s expulsion from Parliament and her personal life into the row.“If she accuses me of being anti-woman, what is she?” Banerjee said, taking a swipe at her marriage to former BJD MP Pinaki Misra.“She broke a 40-year-old marriage and married a man who is 65. Did she not hurt the other lady?”The party, in an official statement, distanced itself from the comments made by both Banerjee and Mitra, stressing that these were personal opinions and not endorsed by the TMC.The internal friction has emerged even as the TMC faces fire from the BJP and opposition over the recent spike in crimes against women in educational institutions — including the RG Kar Medical College rape-murder case last year.BJP’s Dharmendra Pradhan, while addressing a programme in Kolkata, said the “collapse of Bengal’s education system” had once again been exposed. “The RG Kar incident should have been a wake-up call, but the same barbarity has returned,” he said.BJP state chief Sukanta Majumdar, released from lock-up after 15 hours, said: “Two rapes inside educational campuses within eight months — this isn’t an isolated incident but a pattern.” BJP has announced district-level gheraos of SP offices on Monday.Leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari has called for a Nabanna Abhiyan on August 9 in solidarity with the families of both survivors, accusing the state government of shielding political allies at the cost of student safety.",Senior MP Kalyan Banerjee launched a personal attack on party colleague Mahua Moitra after she publicly condemned ‘misogynistic’ remarks made by him and MLA Madan Mitra.

KOLKATA: Trinamool Congress on Sunday sent a show-cause notice to Kamarhati MLA Madan Mitra and censured Serampore MP Kalyan Banerjee for their remarks on the alleged gang-rape of a student at a law college, even as a political slugfest continued between the governing party and the opposition over the safety of women in Bengal.Trinamool president Subrata Bakshi sent the notice to Mitra, instructing him to respond within three days over his ""unsolicited, unnecessary, and insensitive comments on June 28, 2025, that severely damaged the party's image"".Mitra had said the crime had ""sent a message to all girls, to all students that if someone you know calls you on a day when college is closed and exams are going on, saying they'll help with a unit project, don't go.""Banerjee had said on Friday: ""If a friend rapes another friend, how will govt authorities provide protection in such cases?""Trinamool, in a statement, said the comments made by Banerjee and Mitra were their personal opinions and the party did not agree with them in any way.Mitra later said on X that his statement was ""totally misled and misused by a motivated group"". ""I just went through the statement of AITC and request my party high command not to misunderstand me,"" he wrote, adding that he was ready to face any inquiry to clarify his statement.""I do believe that my party will consider twice before taking any further movement in this matter,"" Mitra posted.Banerjee, however, took on MP Mahua Moitra following her statement on X saying: ""Misogyny in India cuts across party lines. What differentiates @AITCofficial is that we condemn these disgusting comments no matter who makes them.""Banerjee told reporters: ""An MP who was expelled from Parliament for breach of ethics is preaching to me!... She only knows how to secure her future and how to make money.""He even took a dig at Moitra's personal life, targeting her marriage with Odisha's former BJD MP Pinaki Misra. ""Mahua has come back to India after her honeymoon and started fighting with me. She accuses me of being anti-woman, then what is she? She has broken up a 40-year marriage and married a guy who is 65 years old. Did she not hurt the lady?"" he added.TMC spokesperson Debangshu Bhattacharya, at a public rally on Saturday, challenged BJP's Locket Chatterjee, Agnimitra Paul and Rupa Ganguly to walk 1km alone in states like UP and Bihar after 8pm. He claimed women in Bengal could go out alone even at 2am. Chatterjee responded: ""The heinous incident happened in Bengal. So why is he commenting on the state of UP?... He should focus on his own state first.""Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan, who was in Kolkata to attend multiple programmes, said atrocities committed on Bengal's women had ""hurt the nation's soul"". ""The governing party has done this. I thought Bengal would learn a lesson from the RG Kar Medical College incident. But the crime at the law college reiterates the same barbaric attitude. The education system in Bengal has collapsed completely, and the party in office has to go,"" he said.BJP state president Sukanta Majumdar, who was released from Lalbazar central lock-up after 15 hours, said: ""In the span of eight months, two women were raped inside an educational institution. This is not an isolated picture. The same pattern is seen in each district college. If one has to compromise so much in the students' wing, we can imagine what happens at the parent party. We will hold rallies and gherao SP offices in districts on Monday. ""State leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari, at a mashal rally at Golpark, appealed to the parents of the RG Kar victim to call for a Nabanna Abhiyan on Aug 9, in which he promised to participate without any flag.","Trinamool president Subrata Bakshi sent the notice to Mitra, instructing him to respond within three days.

Trump's 'Beautiful' effect?

Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina announced Sunday that he would not seek re-election in 2026, a day after voting against the 'Big Beautiful Bill' backed by US President Donald Trump. The 64-year-old is the latest in a series of Senate moderates to step aside in recent years.""In Washington over the last few years, it's become increasingly evident that leaders who are willing to embrace bipartisanship, compromise, and demonstrate independent thinking are becoming an endangered species,"" Tillis said in a statement posted on X.Trump, meanwhile, remarked Tillis' exit as a ""great news"" and said, ""For all cost cutting Republicans, of which I am one, REMEMBER, you still have to get reelected. Don’t go too crazy! We will make it all up, times 10, with GROWTH, more than ever before.""For moderates in the GOP, Tillis’ retirement underscores a stark reality -- breaking with Trump can mean political isolation or an early exit. Trump loyalists wasted no time framing Tillis’ decision as a victory. “Don’t Cross Trump,” declared Jason Miller, a top Trump adviser, signaling that defiance of the president comes at a steep price.""He received 77.3 million votes, 312 electoral votes, and he overwhelmingly won the popular vote. The voters gave him a mandate to implement a specific agenda, and they want everyone to get behind his efforts!"" Miler said.Tillis, who often tried to balance loyalty to Trump with his own policy convictions, found himself repeatedly squeezed. From his skepticism about Trump’s defense secretary pick to his votes on domestic policy, Tillis increasingly became a target for Trump’s ire, and potential primary challengers. His final months in office, as he hinted, may be his freest, as he no longer faces the constraints of re-election politics.""I look forward to having the pure freedom to call the balls and strikes as I see fit and representing the great people of North Carolina to the best of my ability,"" he said in the statement.Does Tillis’ exit ultimately signal that the GOP’s center is hollowing out? As moderates retreat or are forced out, Trump’s grip on the party tightens, leaving little room for dissent or the kind of bipartisan deal-making that once defined Senate veterans like Tillis. The 2026 elections will likely show just how far that transformation has gone.",Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina announced Sunday that he would not seek re-election in 2026.

They got things done. But they were shunned after they courageously refused to cave to their party bosses to nuke the filibuster for the sake of political expediency. They ultimately retired and their presence in the Senate chamber has been sorely missed every day since,"" he added.Trump hailed his exit and said in a post on Truth Social, ""Great News! 'Senator' Thom Tillis will not be seeking reelection.""""For all cost cutting Republicans, of which I am one, REMEMBER, you still have to get reelected. Don’t go too crazy!

“Their body language suggest something…”: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's subtle body language during NYC dinner hints at their true connection,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/their-body-language-suggest-something-taylor-swift-and-travis-kelces-subtle-body-language-during-nyc-dinner-hints-at-their-true-connection/articleshow/122148909.cms,"Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's recent Manhattan outing has sparked discussions about their relationship's potential (TheImageDirect.com)

Body language expert says Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are showing signs of lasting love

Over the weekend, Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce lit up Manhattan with what many are calling the ultimate display of youthful, romantic energy. But it wasn’t just the cute outfits and dinner date that had fans talking—it was the way they moved, dressed, and interacted. According to body language expert Judi James, their coordinated style and subtle affection hint at something deeper than celebrity chemistry: the belief that they may have truly found “the one.”Taylor Swift looked radiant in a flirty pale pink mini dress with gold buttons, while Travis Kelce kept it sleek in cropped black trousers, white socks, loafers, and a crisp white shirt. While this might seem like standard celebrity datewear, James sees it as far more intentional. “Taylor and Travis’s styling and their body language suggest something of a time-warp,” she noted, pointing to their classic prom-queen and king aesthetic.This wasn’t just a fashionable night out. James observed that Kelce’s wardrobe choices are starting to mirror Swift’s romantic style. “Travis's short-cropped black pants and white socks suggest he's gradually and happily style-twinning with her,” she said.But it was his subtle movements that said even more. “Travis sucks his lips in at one point to show he's taking the date very seriously and his large paw of a hand encases Taylor's hand in a clasp of macho protection. ”From their body positioning—Kelce confidently leading while Swift walked demurely behind—to the way she held her small handbag close, everything about their presence suggested a couple relishing that new, enchanted stage of romance. “Taylor's body language epitomizes 'demure' here, with her head lowered, her elbows pulled into her waist and that dinky little bag held in one hand,” James added.James believes this ""first-date college look"" may not be accidental. “It could be a desire to stoke the idyllic romantic side of their relationship or a mutual wish to present each other as 'The One', going back to a teen-date state to delete any high-profile and sometimes less than agreeable relationships they've each had with others in the past,” she explained.Also Read: Why Taylor Swift’s love life feels louder with Travis Kelce than it ever did with Joe Alwyn Swift has long built her brand on emotional storytelling, and this softer, sweeter public persona may be a reflection of a new, more intentional chapter. If their body language is anything to go by, both Swift and Kelce are not just enjoying the moment — they’re laying the groundwork for something much more enduring.","Body language expert says Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are showing signs of lasting love.

Jaisalmer: Jaisalmer superintendent of police Sudhir Choudhary Sunday said that Pakistani couple, Ravi Kumar (17) and Shanti Bai (15), who had crossed international border near Jaisalmer recently, suspected to have died of thirst and dehydration. Their bodies were found Saturday.A photograph of the scene revealed an empty jerry can positioned on the youth's face, illustrating the suffering they endured before their deaths.Kumar and Bai entered into an arranged marriage four months ago in Mirpur Mathelo, Ghotki district, Sindh province, Pakistan. They aspired to build a safe and prosperous life in India and had applied for visas.However, due to strained relations between India and Pakistan, their visa applications were rejected. Determined to reach India, they chose to cross the border illegally. Despite warnings from Kumar's father and a disagreement between them a week earlier, he proceeded with his plan. After crossing the border a week ago, they became disoriented in the Bhibhiyan desert and ultimately succumbed to dehydration. Their bodies were found with an empty jerry can, which they had used to carry water from Pakistan. A medical board conducted a post-mortem Sunday.Dilip Singh Sodha, district coordinator of the Hindu Pakistani Displaced Union and Border People Organization said that if the Indian govt returns the bodies, the relatives in Jaisalmer are prepared to accept them. If the bodies are not repatriated to Pakistan, the relatives are ready to perform the last rites in accordance with Hindu customs, he said.The SP said Pakistani national identity cards were discovered with the bodies, heightening security concerns. The incident might suggest infiltration from across the border or involvement in other criminal activities. Police and various security agencies are conducting a comprehensive investigation. Legal proceedings are being carried out in accordance with regulations, he said.","Pakistani couple, Ravi Kumar (17) and Shanti Bai (15), who had crossed international border near Jaisalmer recently, suspected to have died of thirst and dehydration.

BEIJING: China's top diplomat heads to Europe on Monday for a visit which Beijing said will highlight ties as an ""anchor of stability"" in a world in turmoil.Wang Yi's tour will take him to the European Union's headquarters in Brussels as well as France and Germany as China seeks to improve relations with the bloc as a counterweight to superpower rival the United States.But deep frictions remain over the economy- including a yawning trade deficit of $357.1 billion between China and the EU- and Beijing's close ties with Russia despite Moscow's war in Ukraine.""The world is undergoing an accelerated evolution of a century-old change, with unilateralism, protectionism and bullying behaviour becoming rampant,"" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said on Friday -- a thinly veiled swipe against the United States under President Donald Trump.In that context, Guo said, Beijing and the European bloc must ""keep the world peaceful and stable, safeguard multilateralism, free trade, international rules, fairness and justice, and act firmly as anchors of stability and constructive forces in a volatile world"".Wang will meet with his EU counterpart, Kaja Kallas, at the bloc's headquarters in Brussels for ""high-level strategic dialogue"".In Germany, he will hold talks with Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul on diplomacy and security -- his first visit since Berlin's new conservative-led government took power in May.And in France, Wang will meet minister for Europe and foreign affairs Jean-Noel Barrot, who visited China in March.The war in Ukraine will likely be high on the agenda, with European leaders having been forthright in condemning what they say is Beijing's backing for Moscow.China has portrayed itself as a neutral party in Russia's more than three-year war with Ukraine.But Western governments say Beijing's close ties have given Moscow crucial economic and diplomatic support, and they have urged China to do more to press Russia to end the war.Ties between Europe and China have also strained in recent years as the EU seeks to get tougher on what it says are unfair economic practices by Beijing.After the European bloc placed tariffs on Chinese electric vehicle imports, China retaliated with its own duties, including on French cognac.An agreement on cognac has been reached with Beijing but not formally approved by the Chinese commerce ministry, a source in the French economy ministry told AFP.The source said finalization was partially linked with the EU's ongoing negotiations over EVs.Tensions flared this month after the EU banned Chinese firms from government medical device purchases worth more than five million euros ($5.8 million), in retaliation for limits Beijing places on access to its own market.The latest salvo in trade tensions between the 27-nation bloc and China covered a wide range of healthcare supplies, from surgical masks to X-ray machines, that represent a market worth 150 billion euros in the EU.In response, China accused the European Union of ""double standards"".Another sticking point has been rare earths.Beijing has since April required licences to export these strategic materials from China, which accounts for almost two-thirds of rare earth mining production and 92 percent of global refined output, according to the International Energy Agency.The metals are used in a wide variety of products, including electric car batteries, and there has been criticism from industries about the way China's licences have been issued.China has proposed establishing a ""green channel"" to ease the export of rare earths to the EU, its commerce ministry said this month.",Wang Yi's tour will take him to the European Union's headquarters in Brussels as well as France and Germany. China seeks to improve relations with the bloc as a counterweight to superpower rival the United States. But deep frictions remain over the economy- including a yawning trade deficit of $357.1 billion between China and the EU.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122151925,imgsize-900336,width-400,resizemode-4/122151925.jpg"
China to resume some Japanese seafood imports after Fukushima ban,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/china-to-resume-some-japanese-seafood-imports-after-fukushima-ban/articleshow/122151653.cms,"



BEIJING: China has lifted a ban on seafood imports from most regions of Japan, partially mending a years long dispute over Tokyo's handling of nuclear wastewater.China and Japan are key trading partners, but increased friction over territorial rivalries and military spending has frayed ties in recent years.Japan's brutal occupation of parts of China before and during World War II remains a sore point, with Beijing accusing Tokyo of failing to atone for its past.Japan began gradually releasing treated wastewater from the stricken Fukushima nuclear plant into the Pacific Ocean in 2023.The move was backed by the International Atomic Energy Agency and the plant operator TEPCO says all radioactive elements have been filtered out except for tritium, levels of which are within safe limits.But it drew sharp criticism from Beijing, which banned imports of Japanese seafood as a result. Russia later followed suit.Samples from long term monitoring of nuclear-contaminated water from Fukushima had ""not shown abnormalities"", China's General Administration of Customs said in a statement Sunday.As a result, China ""decided to conditionally resume"" seafood imports from Japan, with the exception of imports from 10 of the country's 47 prefectures, including Fukushima and Tokyo, which remain banned.The Japanese government received the decision ""positively"", Kazuhiko Aoki, deputy chief cabinet secretary, told reporters in Tokyo.But Japan ""will strongly demand the Chinese side lift remaining import regulations on seafood from 10 prefectures"", he added.Japanese Agriculture Minister Shinjiro Koizumi also called China's move ""a major milestone"".In 2011, a huge earthquake triggered a deadly tsunami that swamped the Fukushima nuclear facility and pushed three of its six reactors into meltdown.China vociferously opposed the release of the treated wastewater, casting it as environmentally irresponsible. But in September last year it said it would ""gradually resume"" importing the seafood.Production companies that had suspended trade must reapply for registration in China and would be ""strictly"" supervised, Beijing's customs administration said Sunday.","China has lifted a ban on seafood imports from most regions of Japan.

LUCKNOW: A 48-year-old cloth merchant allegedly died by suicide along with his wife and 16-year-old daughter by consuming poison.

These plates meet and collide, causing frequent seismic activity.As per the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), Afghanistan remains highly vulnerable to natural disasters, including seasonal flooding, landslides and earthquakes.These frequent earthquakes in Afghanistan cause damage to vulnerable communities, which are already grappling with decades of conflict and under-development and have left them with little resilience to cope with multiple simultaneous shocks, UNOCHA noted.","An earthquake of 4.9 magnitude jolted Afghanistan on Sunday, a statement by the National Center for Seismology said.

US Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina announced on Sunday that he will not run for reelection next year.

It also gives Democrats a chance to gain ground in the 2026 midterm elections. Tillis could now play an unpredictable role in the Republican Party, where few members go against Trump.

He accused Tillis of trying to gain attention and said he would campaign against him. Trump also claimed the senator did not do enough to help people in North Carolina after Hurricane Helene caused major flooding.""Tillis is a talker and complainer, NOT A DOER,"" Trump wrote.Tillis gained attention in North Carolina politics when he left his job as an IBM consultant during his second term in the state House. He led the GOP’s efforts to win more seats in the 2010 elections. That year, Republicans took control of the state House and Senate for the first time in 140 years.He later became House speaker and helped pass conservative policies related to taxes, gun laws, business regulations, and abortion. He also supported a 2012 constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage, which passed but was later overturned by the courts.In 2014, Tillis won a close race against Democratic Senator Kay Hagan, helping Republicans take control of the US Senate. During his time in office, he focused on mental health, Medicaid expansion, substance abuse recovery, and veterans’ issues.Tillis, known for working with Democrats on some topics, sometimes faced criticism from his own party.

US sanctions on Turkey's defence sector over its purchase of a Russian air defence system are likely to be ended by the year's end, the US envoy to Ankara said Sunday.Speaking to state news agency Anadolu, Tom Barrack said US President Donald Trump and his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan would instruct their top diplomats to ""figure out the way and end it and Congress will support an intelligent solution"".With both sides committed to drawing a line under the dispute, which has dragged on for five years, the issue could be resolved within six months, Barrack said.""My belief is that by the year end, we have the possibility of having a solution, my belief is they're going to solve the problem,"" he said.Washington imposed sanctions on Ankara in 2020 over its purchase of an S-400 Russian surface-to-air missile defence system under a 2017 law known as CAATSA, which aims to limit Russia's military influence.It also booted Turkey out of its F-35 programme, with Washington saying the presence of the S-400 would allow the Russians to collect information on the stealth jet's capabilities -- a move that further soured ties between the NATO allies.""All these things that have been discussed for five years, F-35s, F-16s, S400s, sanctions, tariffs... Enough. We have to put that aside, and Congress is willing to take a fresh look at it,"" Barrack said.In March, Erdogan spoke to Trump about the need to finalise a deal to let Turkey buy US F-16 fighter planes and be readmitted to the development programme for F-35 warplanes.And last month, he said he saw an end in sight to the sanctions, saying Turkey had seen them eased under Trump.On Tuesday, Erdogan met Trump on the sidelines of a NATO summit in The Hague and called for increased defence industry cooperation with Washington, which he said could significantly boost trade between them.""Advancing cooperation in the defence industry would facilitate achieving the goal of a $100 billion trade volume,"" he said.Turkey, which wants to modernise its air force, has also been seeking to buy 40 Eurofighter Typhoons built by a four-nation consortium of Germany, Britain, Spain and Italy.","US sanctions on Turkey's defence sector over its purchase of a Russian air defence system are likely to be ended by the year's end, the US envoy to Ankara says.

We can therefore increase our imports of American gas, and this could be used to avoid the 10% increase in customs tariffs,"" Lombard added.","French finance minister Eric Lombard says the EU can clinch some form of a trade agreement with the US.

"Flash floods sweep Pakistan’s Swat Valley, kill 32",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/flash-floods-sweep-pakistans-swat-valley-kill-32/articleshow/122146687.cms,"



MINGORA, SWAT: Torrential rain triggered flash floods that tore through Pakistan’s northwestern Swat Valley over the weekend, killing at least 32 people and laying bare gaps in disaster preparedness in a region once ravaged by Taliban.Twelve members of one family were swept away while picnicking along the river in Swat, witnesses said. Phone videos showed relatives clinging to rocks, screaming for help as waters surged around them. “We kept dialling the emergency numbers, but no one came. By the time they did, it was too late… we were pulling out bodies,” local vendor Kabeer said.The family had travelled from Mardan and remained trapped for over an hour with no rescue teams arriving. “This valley has lived through terrorists, military operations, and devastating floods. Every time, we’re promised lessons will be learned, but nothing ever really changes,” said Khan Sher, a resident of Mingora, recalling Taliban control before the 2009 army offensive and the devastation of the 2010 floods.Heavy rain pounded Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab, and Balochistan, causing widespread destruction. “Flash floods caught us off-guard in Swat.We’ve retrieved 16 bodies so far from the river. Rescue operations are ongoing,” a rescue official said.Swat, now a bustling tourist hub, largely escaped the catastrophic 2022 floods that killed over 1,700 nationwide. This time, towns like Bahrain and Kalam, packed with riverside hotels, had little buffer when waters surged. Entire stretches transformed into danger zones within minutes.Pakistan has championed climate justice on global stages, yet its domestic disaster response remains stretched thin. “Each year we mourn our dead, patch up the roads, and brace for the next disaster,” said Liaquat Bacha, a farmer whose fields were washed away.","Torrential rain triggered flash floods that tore through Pakistan’s northwestern Swat Valley over the weekend.
