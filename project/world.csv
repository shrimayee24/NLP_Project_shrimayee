NEW DELHI: Government sources on Thursday refuted Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi 's allegations that Centre does not allow opposition to meet foreign dignitaries.In its response, it said that during any official visit, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) facilitates meetings for the visiting dignitary with Government officials and designated Government bodies. Any engagements outside the Government framework are organised at the discretion of the visiting delegation.The sources also noted that since Rahul Gandhi assumed office as Leader of the Opposition on June 9 2024, several foreign leaders have met him.

'Modi Ji Doesn't...': Rahul Gandhi Accuses Govt Of Blocking Meet With Putin, Calls It 'Insecurity'

NEW DELHI: Hours before Russian President Vladimir Putin ’s arrival in New Delhi, Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi on Thursday accused the Modi-led Centre of not following the ""tradition"" of allowing foreign dignitaries to meet the leader of opposition.Speaking to reporters in the Parliament complex, Rahul expressed displeasure and alleged that the government tells visiting foreign dignitaries not to meet the Leader of the Opposition due to its ""insecurity"".Rahul said, ""Generally, the tradition has been that whoever visits India, the LoP used to have a meeting.

""Defence cooperation has been vital—we saw the value of the S-400 during Operation Sindoor. Discussions are on for more S-400s, or even S-500,"" he said.He added that any labour mobility pact must ensure Indians going abroad for work are not pushed into military roles. “There is much to discuss, and I’m sure the PM and President Putin will have a productive meeting,” Tharoor said.Congress MP from Wayanad Priyanka Gandhi also reacted on Rahul's concern of government not letting LoP meet visiting dignitaries, she said, ""It is very weird. There is a protocol, and all visiting dignitaries meet the LoP. The protocol is being reversed by the government and all their policies are based on this. They don't want anyone to raise their voice. They don't want to listen to any other opinion. They should abide by the protocols of a democracy. God knows what they are scared of. .. In a democracy, everyone should be able to put forward their opinions, discussions must be held, and appropriate action must be taken... The government is insecure, and this decision is a reflection of that... What will they get by breaking and reversing this protocol? This is their insecurity... The image of democracy is tarnished in the world.""Meanwhile, Russian media agency TASS reported that President Putin has departed for his two-day state visit to India.According to the outlet, the Russian delegation will hold wide-ranging discussions on cooperation in trade and economic areas, scientific and technological fields, and cultural and humanitarian sectors. Current international and regional issues will also be part of the agenda.TASS also reported that ten intergovernmental documents and more than fifteen agreements and memorandums between commercial and non-commercial entities of both countries are expected to be signed during the visit.Putin is scheduled to arrive in New Delhi this evening for the 23rd India–Russia Annual Summit. This is his first visit to India since the Ukraine conflict began in 2022; his last visit was in December 2021. The two-day trip is taking place at the invitation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi .The Prime Minister is also set to host a private dinner for the Russian President upon his arrival in the capital.","Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi on Thursday accused the Modi-led Centre of not following the ""tradition"" of allowing foreign dignitaries to meet the opposition leader.

'Have a common enemy': Israel presses India to designate Hamas as terrorist group; calls for reciprocity post-LeT listing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/have-a-common-enemy-israel-presses-india-to-designate-hamas-as-terrorist-group-calls-for-reciprocity-post-let-listing/articleshow/125764661.cms,"(Image credits: ANI)

'Israel-India Defense Ties Are Long-Standing And Strategic': Expert Danny Citrinowicz

NEW DELHI: Israel has urged India to formally designate Hamas and other groups acting against it as terrorist organisations, saying that New Delhi’s position carries significant weight across South Asia.Senior officials from Israel’s ministry of foreign affairs, speaking in Jerusalem, said they believe India understands the “networks and linkages” behind these organisations. They stressed that Israel had already proscribed Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and now expects “reciprocation” from India.“Our request from India is to work hard to sanction and designate these organisations as terrorist groups. Israel designated Lashkar-e-Taiba a couple of years ago, and we would like to see this reciprocated,” one official said, as quoted by ANI.Israel also underlined what it described as strong ties between Hamas and LeT, and warned that Iran’s IRGC, Hamas and Hezbollah have increasingly been relying on transnational criminal groups to conduct attacks.“You're not going to see an Iranian operative act directly in Europe. What you will see is a criminal group -- a drug lord, a human trafficker or another network -- connected to an Iranian handler who then carries out an attack, as we've seen in Scandinavia or in London,” the official said.The remarks came just days after a similar appeal from the Israeli Defence Forces. “It will be a good thing if India did. India and Israel have a common enemy. It will be good to have a clear statement on who we face,” Lt Col Nadav Shoshani, International Spokesperson for the IDF, said in Tel Aviv on December 1.Another official emphasised that even a declaratory move from India would have a “strong global impact”, given the influence India holds in the region. “Neighbouring countries such as Bangladesh, Pakistan and the Maldives ‘look up to India’, and New Delhi’s stance shapes regional responses,” the official said.“It's not only about freezing assets or banning operatives from entering India. It signals that India has clearly seen what Hamas is doing, and no operative should step on Indian soil,” he added.“We are putting pressure on India to designate Hamas... After having designated Lashkar-e-Taiba, we would like to see the same,” the official said, noting “clear attempts” by Hamas to rebuild its structures and stressing that dismantling them remains central to the next phase of the US-proposed ceasefire.Hamas, founded in 1987 as an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, is designated a terrorist organisation by the US, UK, Canada and several other countries. India condemned the October 7, 2023, attacks but has not yet listed Hamas under its domestic terrorism laws.",Israel has urged India to formally designate Hamas and other groups acting against it as terrorist organisations.

Pakistan Sparks Controversy With Expired Relief Claims As India Rejects Airspace Allegation Strongly

NEW DELHI: Pakistan on Tuesday renewed its allegations that its relief operations for cyclone-hit Sri Lanka were being “hampered by lack of cooperation” from India, claiming that permission to use Indian airspace was being delayed.“India continues to block humanitarian assistance from Pakistan to Sri Lanka. The special aircraft carrying Pakistan’s humanitarian assistance to Sri Lanka continues to face delays for over 60 hours now awaiting flight clearance from India,” the Pakistan Foreign Office said in a post on X.It added that the “partial flight clearance issued by India last night, after 48 hours, was operationally impractical: time-bound for just a few hours and without validity for the return flight, severely hindering this urgent relief Mission for the brotherly people of Sri Lanka.”Shortly after, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal rejected Pakistan’s claims, calling them “ridiculous” and “yet another attempt to spread anti-India misinformation.”He clarified that the request for overflight clearance for the Pakistani aircraft carrying humanitarian aid was received by the Indian High Commission in Islamabad around 1:00 PM on December 1, 2025. “Given the urgency of the humanitarian assistance, the Government of India processed the request expeditiously the same day and granted overflight permission as per the proposed itinerary at 5:30 PM on December 1, 2025,” he said, in an official statement.Officials also dismissed reports in the Pakistani media claiming India had not granted overflight permission as “fake”. “Pakistani media, as usual, is indulging in propaganda and peddling fake news. These allegations are baseless and misleading. All requests for overflight or transit are processed strictly in accordance with established procedures and international norms,” one of the people said.Meanwhile, the Pakistan High Commission in Sri Lanka faced criticism online after sharing images of the relief materials sent to the flood-hit country.In a post on X Tuesday, the High Commission uploaded photos showing stacks of packaged supplies, stating: “Relief packages from Pakistan have been successfully delivered to assist our brothers and sisters affected by the recent floods in Sri Lanka, which signifies our unwavering solidarity.” However, netizens quickly noticed what appeared to be expiry dates of October 2024 printed on some of the packages.Sri Lanka has been grappling with widespread flooding, landslides, and infrastructure collapse triggered by Cyclone Ditwah, leaving several districts isolated and severely straining the country’s disaster-response capacity. India launched Operation Sagar Bandhu to assist Sri Lanka in its recovery efforts.The Disaster Management Centre (DMC) confirmed at least 410 deaths and 336 missing as of Tuesday morning due to the catastrophic floods and landslides caused by extreme weather conditions since November 16.","Pakistan claims permission to use Indian airspace was being delayed.

"Karnataka CM tussle: Two breakfasts later, Sidda–DKS standoff persists — why it’s a Catch-22 situation for Congress high command",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/karnataka-cm-tussle-two-breakfasts-later-siddadks-standoff-persists-why-its-a-catch-22-situation-for-congress-high-command/articleshow/125746309.cms,"'We Are United...Will Go To Delhi If High Command Calls': Siddaramaiah, Shivakumar After Meeting

Sidda vs DKS: A long rivalry

Kurubas and Vokkaligas are considered rival castes in the state. While Siddaramaiah hails from the Kuruba caste, DKS is from the Vokkaliga community.

Siddaramaiah is quintessentially a politician and is not known for his business ventures. Meanwhile, DKS is one of the richest politicians and has many big business interests.

Shivakumar is known for having friends across different parties in Karnataka. However, Siddaramaiah has soured relationships with BJP and JDS.

Fine-tuned caste arithmetic

Future of Congress

Status quo, Siddaramaiah stays full-term

Mid-term power rotation naming Shivakumar the chief minister

Hybrid compromise — phased transition, date announced publicly

Dark horse

Kharge factor

NEW DELHI: A lot can happen over a cup of coffee. But even after two breakfasts between Siddaramaiah and his deputy DK Shivakumar , the question over the chief ministerial post in Karnataka still remains unanswered.As the Congress government reached the halfway mark in the state, reports quoting Congress sources suggested that MLAs and MLCs from Shivakumar’s faction had camped in Delhi to push the party high command to make him the next chief minister.Now, both Siddaramaiah and DKS are looking towards the party high command in Delhi for answers.However, the cleanup task for the party high command is not going to be easy, as this is beyond personalities. The Karnataka tussle contains loyalty, fine-tuned caste arithmetic and the future of Congress in the state.Siddaramaiah and DK Shivakumar together scripted the victory for Congress in the assembly elections in 2023. While Siddaramaiah's AHINDA (Minorities, backward classes and Dalits) countered Bharatiya Janata Party's Lingayat-Brahmin voter base, Shivakumar was credited for managing the organisational machinery in the party.However, even during the run-up to the elections, the rift between both the leaders was clearly visible. During the campaign, Sidda and DKS were rarely seen together sharing a stage. It was only at the eleventh hour that Karnataka party president Shivakumar met Siddaramaiah to put up a united front and bring supporters of both the leaders together.Despite being the pillars of the party in the state, the leaders are polar opposites.After Congress won in Karnataka, the high command was in a fix over the CM face. After days of deliberation, the party went ahead with Siddaramaiah's name given his seniority and popularity. However, an agreement was reportedly reached that DK Shivakumar would take over the reins in the second half of the government.Recently, DKS confirmed the ""secret deal"" after he claimed that there had indeed been “a confidential understanding on leadership transition among five-six leaders” soon after Congress won a landslide in the 2023 elections.“This is confidential. I don’t want to speak publicly on this,” he added.Now after the two and a half years are completed, several seers from the Vokkaliga community are supporting Shivakumar's claim to the chief ministership, emphasising that the community had not held the post since the early 2000s.This has created additional pressure on the party as Vokkaligas have around 13–14 percent share in Karnataka's population, making it the second-most dominant landowning caste after Lingayats.Meanwhile, Siddaramaiah, 79 years old, is the tallest Kuruba leader Karnataka has seen. The Kurubas, a significant OBC community forming around 6–7% of the population, have historically lacked an undisputed mass leader until Siddaramaiah built his political philosophy around them.Additionally, Sidda has also built a support base among the AHINDA community, countering the dominance of Lingayats and Vokkaligas.This has added to the dilemma of the high command as picking Sidda would mean sidelining Vokkaligas and going with DKS would mean looking over the AHINDA and Kurubas.Amid the ongoing tussle over the chief ministerial post, the danger of losing majority in the Vidhan Soudha is looming over Congress government's head.There are 23 Vokkaliga MLAs in the grand old party who are supporting DKS. In a scenario where the Congress high command decides to continue with Siddaramaiah as the chief minister, these MLAs who are openly backing DKS can pull out support from the government.Meanwhile, 9 Kuruba MLAs and 34 Lingayat MLAs are supporting Siddaramaiah, making the CM tussle a Catch-22 situation for the high command.With the decision window narrowing, Congress leadership now has three realistic options:This route maintains continuity, protects AHINDA influence, and sends a signal of stability. A cabinet reshuffle may be sanctioned later as compensation to placate those backing Shivakumar.Backers of DKS see this as honouring commitment and preventing factional drift. But replacing a sitting CM at the midpoint could cause internal rupture if not managed delicately.A future-dated swap could satisfy both camps temporarily, provided the timeline is seen as credible and binding. It is the most politically pragmatic formula but only works if both factions stand down simultaneously.Meanwhile, Bharatiya Janata Party floated another theory that Congress may ignore both Siddaramaiah and DK Shivakumar and choose a “dark horse” for the chief ministerial post in the state.Talking to reporters, former Karnataka CM and BJP MP Basavaraj Bommai said that chief minister Siddaramaiah and his deputy DKS are “being inflexible due to their ego,” leading the high command to consider alternative options.“CM and Deputy CM both have a very egoistic attitude. They are not ready to budge an inch. Therefore, the high command is compelled to think of the other alternative. So in this context, a dark horse might emerge in the state,” Bommai said.Amid the ongoing developments in the state, all eyes are now on Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge who may be the only one with a solution for this deadlock.Kharge, who also hails from Karnataka, is one of the most seasoned functionaries in the state. First elected to the state assembly in 1972, Kharge won nine consecutive elections until 2008, earning the nickname ‘Solillada Sardara’ (the undefeated chieftain).Acknowledging the power tussle between the CM and his deputy, Kharge played down the “internal conflict” within the party and said that the “high command” will sit together and deliberate on the issue.“Only the people there can say what the government is doing. But I would like to say that we will resolve such issues,” Kharge said.“People in high command — Rahul Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi and I — will sit together and deliberate on this… We will give the medicine when required,” he added.","Siddaramaiah hails from the Kuruba caste, DKS is from the Vokkaliga community.

(With agency inputs)

BERHAMPORE/KOLKATA: Trinamool suspended Thursday its MLA Humayun Kabir, who had earned the Bengal governing party’s ire by publicly declaring his plan to “lay the foundation of a Babri Masjid-style mosque in Murshidabad on Dec 6”.The belligerent MLA remained defiant despite getting the stick for “communal politics”, declaring he would go ahead with the mosque foundation plan and float his own party by Dec 22. Assembly elections in Bengal are due next year.Kabir was informed of his suspension when he went to attend a rally of CM Mamata Banerjee in Berhampore. At the rally, Mamata expressed anguish without naming Kabir. “If one grain of rice rots, it needs to be removed, otherwise the rest will spoil... There are some insects and pests. They will be there. But when we spot them, we remove them and continue with our work, our way. Hindus and Muslims will live in unity here,” Mamata said.Kolkata mayor and senior TMC minister Firhad Hakim formally announced Kabir’s suspension, saying the decision had been approved by the CM. “He will have no relation with the party from this moment. Anyone can build a mosque. But there must be no communal provocation,” Hakim said, stressing TMC “does not believe in communal provocation” at a time it is working to maintain peace before the polls.Kabir called his suspension “deliberate humiliation”, announcing he would press ahead with the mosque event in Murshidabad’s Beldanga even if that meant getting “arrested or killed” on Dec 6, marking the Babri demolition anniversary. He declared he would resign as Bharatpur MLA and launch his own party, adding it will contest 135 assembly seats (out of 294) next year.Kabir had moved between Congress, TMC and BJP before returning to the governing party. He is often seen in TMC as a “loose cannon”.",Humayun Kabir had publicly declared his plan to “lay the foundation of a Babri Masjid-style mosque in Murshidabad on Dec 6’ Kabir declared he would resign as Bharatpur MLA and launch his own party.

Putin Makes HUGE U-Turn On Ukraine Peace Deal? ‘CLUELESS’ Trump Suffers Setback Once Again

NEW DELHI: A day before Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in India, India abstained from voting on a UN General Assembly (UNGA) resolution demanding an end to Russia’s forced relocation of Ukrainian children.The 193-member Assembly adopted the draft resolution ‘Return of Ukrainian children’ on Wednesday, with 91 votes in favour, 12 against, and 57 — including India, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Egypt, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka’s — abstentions.The resolution demanded that Russia “ensure the immediate, safe and unconditional return of all Ukrainian children who have been forcibly transferred or deported” and urged Moscow to cease, without delay, any further practice of forcible transfer, deportation, separation from families and legal guardians, change of personal status, including through citizenship, adoption or placement in foster families, and indoctrination of Ukrainian children.It stressed the need to investigate and ensure accountability for those responsible for forcible transfers and deportations of children, in accordance with international law. The resolution deplored the legislative and administrative measures taken by Russia since 2022 that “simplify” the procedure for obtaining Russian citizenship for Ukrainian children, particularly orphans, children deprived of parental care and unaccompanied children.Ukraine’s deputy Foreign Minister Mariana Betsa, presenting the draft resolution at the 11th emergency special session of UNGA, said as of Oct 2025, there are 6,395 deported and forcibly transferred children. In total, over 20,000 cases of deportation and forcible transfer are being investigated.Russia’s deputy Permanent Representative Maria Zabolotskaya, in her remarks in UNGA, said the draft resolution is stuffed with “mendacious accusations”, adding it contains baseless allegations of Russia’s violations of international humanitarian law and does not mention that there may be children evacuated from combat zone or those who lost ties with their relatives, which in no way can be regarded as violations.UNGA President Annalena Baerbock said since Feb 2022, when Russia launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Assembly has reiterated its calls, across eight resolutions adopted during its 11th Emergency Special Session, for immediate, complete, and unconditional withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine’s internationally recognised territory.",India abstained from voting on a UN General Assembly (UNGA) resolution demanding an end to Russia’s forced relocation of Ukrainian children.

Are Live-In Relationships Right For You? BK Shivani Explains

‘Not of right age doesn’t mean one can be deprived of rights’

JAIPUR: The Rajasthan HC has held that two consenting adults have the right to be in a live-in relationship even if they have not attained legal age for marriage. The legal marriageable age for women in India is 18 years, and for men, 21. At 18, men and women are considered adults.. Justice Anoop Dhand delivered the judgment on Monday while hearing a protection petition filed by an 18-year-old woman and a 19-year-old youth from Kota. A copy of the order was uploaded Thursday.Both had approached the HC seeking police protection, stating they had entered a live-in relationship by mutual consent.Both had approached the high court seeking police protection, stating they had entered a live-in relationship by mutual consent. The couple executed a live-in agreement on Oct 27, 2025. However, the girl’s family opposed it and allegedly threatened to kill them. The petitioners told the court that despite submitting a written request to the police in Kota, no action was taken.Appearing for the state, Vivek Choudhary, the public prosecutor argued that since the boy had not completed 21 years of age, he could not legally marry, and, therefore, should not be allowed to be in a live-in partnership.However, the HC rejected this reasoning, observing that the “right to life and personal liberty” is guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution, and any threat to it amounts to a constitutional violation.Justice Dhand emphasised that the constitutional duty of the State is to protect the life and liberty of every citizen. “Only because the petitioners are not marriageable by law, they cannot be deprived of their fundamental rights,” the court observed.The court also said live-in relationships are neither illegal, nor an offence under Indian law, directing Bhilwara and Jodhpur (Rural) SPs to verify the facts mentioned in the petition, particularly the threat perception, and provide protection to the couple, if needed.","The Rajasthan HC has held that two consenting adults have the right to be in a live-in relationship even if they have not attained legal age for marriage.

Can Ijtihad Lead to Islamic Reform? A Deep Dive With Abhijeet Iyer Mitra

NAGPUR: Quoting a Supreme Court ruling, Nagpur bench of Bombay high court has said the use of loudspeakers is not essential to practising a religion, and that amplified sound cannot infringe on the rights of unwilling listeners. Dismissing a plea by Masjid Gousiya in Maharashtra’s Gondia district, seeking a directive to restore use of loudspeakers at the mosque, the bench on Monday said the petitioner failed to produce any legal or religious document establishing a right to use loudspeakers for offering prayers.A division bench said: “The top court had observed that no religion prescribes prayers be performed by disturbing the peace of others through voice amplifiers or drum beating.” At a hearing on Oct 16, HC asked the petitioner to demonstrate whether installing loudspeakers was mandatory in religious practice.The petitioner could not produce supporting material and was “not entitled to seek relief”, it said. “The SC had also noted that while there is a right to speech, there exists a right to listen or decline to listen. Nobody can be compelled to listen, and nobody can claim he has a right to make his voice trespass the minds of others,” the bench observed. The HC detailed Rules of 2000 framed under Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, and cited health risks of noise pollution.",Nagpur bench of Bombay high court has said the use of loudspeakers is not essential to practising a religion.

'Pillar Of Tamil Cinema' AVM Saravanan Passes Away At 86!

CHENNAI: M Saravanan , the soft-spoken steward of AVM Productions who nurtured Tamil cinema through more than half a century of changes while helping shape careers of its greatest stars like Kamal Haasan, Sivaji Ganesan, Vyjayanthimala and Sivakumar, died Thursday in Chennai of age-related ailments. He was 86.Widely known as the “gentleman producer” of Kollywood, M Saravanan, along with his brothers Kumaran, Murugan, and Balasubramanian, oversaw AVM Productions — India’s oldest film studio — for more than 60 years, producing a string of box-office hits in Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, and Hindi. The studio was founded by his father AV Meiyappan in 1945.Saravanan’s name first appeared in the credits of Mamiyar Mechina Marumagal (1959), a remake of a Marathi film. The movie didn’t do well, but his next, Deiva Piravi, starring Sivaji Ganesan, became a success and was later remade in Hindi as Bindya (starring Balraj Sahni).Over the decades, Saravanan supervised a scintillating catalogue that came to define Tamil cinema. These included Kalathur Kannamma (which introduced Kamal Haasan in 1960), Shivaji Ganesan’s Pava Mannippu (1961), MGR’s Anbe Vaa (1966), Rajinikanth’s Paayum Puli (1983).Tributes poured in on Thursday. Chief minister MK Stalin said Saravanan’s AVM Production had a long bond with the Dravidian movement’s cinematic journey. “The bond grew into a relationship of familial affection.... When I visited the AVM Heritage Museum in May 2023, he warmly reminisced about those cherished memories,” Stalin recalled. Tamil Nadu Governor RN Ravi described Saravanan’s death as a “significant loss to the cultural and creative landscape” of the state.Saravanan is survived by his son MS Guhan, daughter Usha and his brothers.","AVM Saravanan died Thursday in Chennai of age-related ailments.

'Days Of Maoists Are Numbered In India': Bastar Top Cop Issues Final Warning To Left Wing Extremists

RAIPUR: Maoist casualties in Wednesday’s operation by security personnel in Chhattisgarh’s Bastar region rose to 18 after six more bodies, including wanted PLGA commander Vella Modiyam, were retrieved Thursday from the gunfight site along the Dantewada-Bijapur border.Nine of the slain guerrillas, who had a combined bounty of Rs 1.3 crore on their heads, were women. Three security personnel were killed in the fighting. The operation dealt what police said was a decisive blow to the Maoist citadel in Gangaloor. “Vella, aka Mangu Modiyam, was the Maoists’ operational and intelligence commander in Gangaloor and involved in multiple crimes, including the killing of a minor, a student and a villager in Peddakorma,” Bastar IGP Sundarraj said.CM Vishnu Deo Sai lauded the personnel involved in the operation, saying the bravery of the trio killed in action “won’t go in vain”. His deputy Vijay Sharma said Naxalism in Chhattisgarh was now on its “last legs”, with forces engaged in a mop-up across Bastar.",Nine of the slain guerrillas had a combined bounty of Rs 1.3 crore on their heads.

India Tells UN Its Women Warriors Of Peace Lead In Protecting Female, Children in Conflict Zones

RAIPUR: A bizarre case of a foster family allegedly trying to “protect” a young woman from a suspected molester by locking her in a room since she was eight has come to light in Chhattisgarh’s Bastar after officials reached their home to rescue her from what had been her prison for two decades.The orphaned girl, now in her 20s, barely responds when her name is called, has severely impaired eyesight, and appears traumatised after years without exposure to sunlight, open air or social contact, said Sister Clarelit of Gharaunda Ashram at Korchuli near Jagdalpur.Bastar collector Harish S told TOI the social welfare dept is probing her forced confinement “as a case of potential criminal negligence, unlawful detention, and violation of human rights”.“Officials are questioning her family members and probing the circumstances that led to such prolonged confinement… We will initiate action once the report is filed,” he said.Sources in the department quoted the woman’s foster family as saying they feared she would be sexually assaulted by an unidentified young man in the neighbourhood who had allegedly been after her. They claimed he was a habitual offender who would have targeted her if he saw her outside.Medical findings indicate slim chances of her regaining full eyesight. “Good news is she is slowly learning to respond, & walk with support,” Sister Clarelit said.","The orphaned girl, now in her 20s, barely responds when her name is called.

Who was Yasser Abu Shabab? Israel-backed anti-Hamas militia leader killed in Gaza,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/who-was-yasser-abu-shabab-israel-backed-anti-hamas-militia-leader-killed-in-gaza/articleshow/125778042.cms,"



Anti-Hamas militia leader Yasser Abu Shabab was killed on Thursday in an “internal clash” in the southern Gaza Strip, Times of Israel reported, citing Israeli defence sources.According to the sources, Abu Shabab was taken to a hospital in Israel, where he died of his wounds.Abu Shabab, a Bedouin tribal leader based in Israeli-held Rafah, led the most prominent of several small anti-Hamas groups that emerged in Gaza during the war.The Ynet news site cited a “senior source within the militia,” who said a fight broke out between families and groups within the militia, which deteriorated until shots were fired, at which point Abu Shabab was killed. Ynet later cited an Israeli security official as saying he was beaten to death as part of an argument over collaborating with Israel.When and Where: The incident occurred on Thursday in the southern Gaza Strip. As of Thursday afternoon, there was no official comment from the militia or Israeli authorities.Hamas, which branded Abu Shabab a collaborator and ordered its fighters to kill or capture him, has denied that his group received backing from Israel. Despite a US-backed ceasefire reached in October, the group continued to operate in areas controlled by Israeli forces.On November 18, the group posted a video showing dozens of fighters receiving orders from his deputy to launch a security sweep to “clear Rafah of terror,” an apparent reference to Hamas fighters believed to be holed up there.Israel’s broader operations in southern Gaza also continued. The Israel Defense Forces said on Thursday that security forces had killed more than 40 Hamas operatives in that area, including the commander of Hamas’s East Rafah Battalion, his deputy, and two other terror operatives, all of whom were killed on Sunday. According to the military, the four were spotted emerging from tunnels in eastern Rafah and were killed by troops and the Israeli Air Force.The IDF said that following a review of intelligence, it could officially confirm that Mohammad Bawab, the East Rafah Battalion commander; Ismail Abu Labda, the deputy battalion commander; Tawfiq Salem, a company commander; and Abdullah Hamad, the son of a senior Hamas official, were the four operatives killed.Bawab and Abu Labda were responsible for planning the battalion’s invasion of southern Israel during the October 7-2023 onslaught, the military said. Hamad, the son of senior Hamas official Ghazi Hamad, served as a security officer in Bawab’s team.Meanwhile, troops of the 7th Armoured Brigade stationed in southern Gaza opened fire on Thursday on a Palestinian terror operative who crossed the so-called Yellow Line that divides Gaza as part of the ceasefire agreement. The IDF said the operative posed “an immediate threat” to the soldiers. “The troops opened fire on the terrorists to remove the threat, and a hit was identified,” the military said.In related developments, Israel confirmed that the remains of Sudthisak Rinthalak, a Thai farmer kidnapped by terrorists from Israel on October 7-2023, had been returned to Israel. Only one hostage’s body remains held in the Strip—that of police officer Master Sgt. Ran Gvili.In the next stage of US President Donald Trump’s peace plan, Israel is meant to withdraw further from the Strip, establish a transitional authority to govern Gaza, deploy a multinational security force to take over from the Israeli military, disarm Hamas, and begin reconstruction. Hamas has so far refused to agree on demilitarisation. Israel insists the Strip must be demilitarised before the plan can advance. However, the US leader said Wednesday that phase two is “going to happen pretty soon,” adding that the process is “going along well. ”","Yasser Abu Shabab, a Bedouin tribal leader based in Israeli-held Rafah, led the most prominent of several small anti-Hamas groups that emerged in Gaza during the war.

US strike in Pacific: Four killed in blitz on alleged narco-terror boat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-strikes-pacific-four-killed-in-blitz-on-alleged-narco-terror-boat-watch/articleshow/125778482.cms,"



The US military said four people were killed on Thursday in a strike on a suspected drug-trafficking vessel in the eastern Pacific, the latest action in a counter-narcotics campaign that has drawn intensifying scrutiny.According to a post by US Southern Command on X, Joint Task Force Southern Spear conducted the strike on the orders of Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth after intelligence indicated the boat, operated by a “designated terrorist organization,” was carrying illicit narcotics along a known trafficking route. The post said “four male narco-terrorists aboard the vessel were killed,” releasing a short video that showed the craft speeding across the water before being hit by an explosion.US defense secretary Pete Hegseth in a post on X reacted to the strike. He posted, ""Your wish is our command, Andrew. Just sunk another narco boat,"" while responding to an request for downing another alleged narco-boat.The development came hours after lawmakers viewed classified footage of a separate incident from early September, in which US forces struck a vessel already destroyed in an earlier engagement, killing two survivors.Representative Jim Himes, the top Democrat on the house intelligence committee, said the footage showed “the United States military attacking shipwrecked sailors - bad guys, bad guys - but attacking shipwrecked sailors,” calling it “one of the most troubling things I've seen in my time in public service.” He added: “You have two individuals in clear distress without any means of locomotion, with a destroyed vessel, who were killed by the United States,” reported AFP.Republican Representative Don Bacon also raised concerns, saying on CNN that “these two people were trying to survive and our... rules of war would not allow us to kill survivors,” noting that such action requires an “imminent threat” which he said was absent. But Senator Tom Cotton defended the operation, insisting the sequence of strikes on September 2 was lawful. “The first strike, the second strike, and the third and the fourth strike on September 2 were entirely lawful and needful,” he said, arguing the footage showed two survivors “trying to flip a boat loaded with drugs bound for the United States back over so they could stay in the fight. ”Both the White House and Pentagon have sought to distance Hegseth from the decision to target survivors, saying operational responsibility rested with admiral Frank Bradley, who directly oversaw the mission. Lawmakers said Bradley told them Hegseth had not ordered that all crew be killed, though Bacon maintained the defence secretary remains ultimately accountable because “he's the secretary of defense.”The Trump administration has framed the campaign as part of a broader push against “narco-terrorists,” deploying major naval assets to the Caribbean for counter-narcotics operations. The moves have heightened tensions in the region, with Venezuela’s President Nicolás Maduro accusing Washington of using drug enforcement as a pretext for “imposing regime change” in Caracas.(With inputs from agency)","US military said four people were killed on Thursday in a strike on a suspected drug-trafficking vessel in the eastern Pacific.

Russian President Vladimir Putin's alleged secret daughter, Luiza Rozova, apologised for the Ukraine war when Ukrainian journalist Dmytro Sviatnenko confronted her on the streets of Paris.Sviatnenko’s brother, drone pilot Volodymyr, had been killed in a Russian airstrike in November, and the reporter demanded Rozova speak to her alleged father and urge him to end the conflict.“Three weeks ago, your father killed my brother,” Sviatnenko told Rozova. When asked if she supported Putin’s policies, she replied, “I did not give you permission to film me,” covering her mouth with a mask, New York Post reported.“I’m really sorry that this is happening. Unfortunately, I’m not responsible for this situation,” Rozova, 22 year old DJ, added.Sviatnenko pointed out that Kyiv was without power and under an air raid alert, and again asked how she felt about her father’s policies. Rozova responded, “What does that have to do with me?” He suggested she call her father and say, “Dad, stop shelling Kyiv.” Rozova said, “Well, of course,” but explained she could not arrange travel.When Sviatnenko offered to buy her a plane ticket to Ukraine so she could perform “better than any Patriot air defence system” and end the “mess” in his country, Rozova said, “Unfortunately, I can’t help you. I’m very sorry.”Who is Rozova?Rozova is alleged to be the love child of Putin and his former mistress, cleaner-turned-multimillionaire Svetlana Krivonogikh. Born in 2003, she was outed as Putin’s alleged secret daughter in 2020 by Russian media outlet Proekt, which cited her “phenomenal resemblance” to her alleged dad. The outlet reported that Putin was not listed on Rozova’s birth certificate but that her patronymic “Vladimirovna” meant “daughter of Vladimir. ”An art school graduate, Rozova had largely kept a low profile until she became more active on social media. In August, she appeared to condemn Putin in a post on Telegram without naming him, writing, “It’s liberating to be able to show my face to the world again” and “It reminds me of who I am and who destroyed my life,” according to Bild.","Russian President Vladimir Putin's alleged secret daughter, Luiza Rozova, apologised for the Ukraine war.

The US Supreme Court on Thursday cleared the way for Texas to use its new congressional map, boosting the Republican Party’s chances of winning five additional US House seats in the 2026 midterm election.The unsigned order granted Texas’s emergency request to pause a three-judge panel’s ruling that had blocked the map amid allegations of racial discrimination, NPR news reported.In October, the three-judge panel held a nine-day hearing and concluded that challengers were likely to prove at trial that the map violated the Constitution by discriminating against voters based on race. In its majority opinion, authored by a Trump nominee, the panel cited a letter from the Department of Justice and public statements by key Republican state lawmakers indicating their mapdrawer manipulated racial demographics to eliminate districts where Black and Latino voters formed the majority.The panel ordered Texas to continue using the congressional districts drawn in 2021 for the next year’s mid-term elections.Texas appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that lawmakers were motivated by a desire to draw districts more favourable to Republicans rather than by race. In November, Justice Samuel Alito allowed Texas to temporarily reinstate the new map while the high court considered the emergency application.The mid-decade redistricting plan in Texas prompted a counter-response in California, where voters in a special election in November approved a new congressional map that could help Democrats gain five additional House seats. A court hearing on the legal challenge to that map is set for Dec. 15.The broader redistricting landscape remains unsettled. Lawsuits are challenging new gerrymanders in Missouri amid a contested referendum effort, and states including Florida, Indiana and Virginia may pursue new districts before the mid-term elections. Last week, a federal court ruled that North Carolina’s mid-term election could proceed under its recently redrawn map, which may give Republicans an extra seat.Another wave of congressional redistricting may follow pending a Supreme Court ruling in a voting rights case concerning Louisiana’s map. After the court held a rare rehearing in October, some states are watching for an earlier-than-usual decision that could allow Republican-led states to adopt more GOP-friendly districts in time for the 2026 mid-term polls.","Texas appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that lawmakers were motivated by a desire to draw districts more favourable to Republicans rather than by race.

The arrest of Brian Cole revived questions surrounding the two pipe bombs planted in Washington on the night before the 6 January 2021 Capitol riot.For nearly five years, investigators struggled to identify who left the explosives outside the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee and the Republican National Committee.Now that Cole is in custody, questions have been raised about whether the bombs were an actual threat and what they were capable of.According to investigators, the devices were classic improvised pipe bombs constructed from 20-centimetre galvanised metal pipes, sealed at both ends. They were packed with homemade black powder that was capable of producing a lethal blast.Each device had a firing system based on simple wiring and a kitchen timer to function as a triggering mechanism. The FBI had confirmed that these components would have caused a lethal detonation if they were left undisturbed, even if they were notThe bombs never exploded, but officials have said that they could have caused serious injuries or deaths. Both locations were close to heavily used political offices and a short walk from the Capitol. Security officers, party staff and members of Congress regularly pass through the area.But what was the motive of placing those bombs in the first place? Investigators have long examined whether the devices were meant to act as a diversion to pull police resources away from the Capitol before the January 6 riot. That theory has never been confirmed, largely because officials could not identify a suspect until now.For years, the investigation into the pipe bombs frustrated investigators. Hundreds of tips were reviewed, as well as thousands of hours of video footage, yet the case remained one of the most puzzling unsolved chapters of the events surrounding the Capitol attack. The lack of progress resulted in tonnes of conspiracy theories from some Republican lawmakers, while others criticised how security officials failed to detect the bombs for 17 hours.Cole’s arrest may finally allow investigators to answer the central questions that have haunted people across party lin since that night in January 2021.There are several questions that still need to be answered. The forensic details of the devices suggest clear intent and the capability for serious harm. What remains to be determined is why they were placed and whether Cole acted alone.","Two pipe bombs were planted in Washington on the night before the 6 January 2021 Capitol riot. For nearly five years, investigators struggled to identify who left the explosives outside the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee and the Republican National Committee.

He also blamed certain GBA officials for pressuring him

He said the situation pushed him mentally and financially to a breaking point

Harassed, Tortured And Repeatedly Threatened

BENGALURU: The relentless pressure of a neighbourhood dispute, a looming civic notice, and a Rs 20-lakh demand he said he could not meet — a combination that pushed a 45-year-old techie to end his life inside the very house he was trying to build.Hours before his scheduled appearance before Greater Bengaluru Authority (GBA) officials, Murali Govindaraju was found hanging on the second floor of his under-construction home in Nallurahalli on Wednesday morning, leaving behind a 10-page death note accusing a neighbouring family and civic officials of driving him to suicide.Murali, a software employee at ITPL and father of two minor girls, lived in Brookbong Layout, Whitefield. Police have arrested his neighbours Shashi Nambiar (64) and Usha (57) on charges of abetment and are searching for their son, Varun. The couple has been sent to 14-day judicial custody.According to police, the contents of Murali’s lengthy death note mirror the allegations in a criminal complaint filed by his mother, Lakshmi Govindaraju (61). She stated that her son had been “harassed, tortured and repeatedly threatened” by the Nambiars, who allegedly demanded Rs 20 lakh to stop accusing him of plan violations.She said Murali told her that Wednesday was the deadline the couple had set.Murali had bought the 40x60 sqft plot in 2018 from a close relative of the Nambiars. The relationship soured soon after construction began, with Usha and Shashi repeatedly accusing him of deviation from the approved plan. Lakshmi alleged that when Murali refused to pay, Usha lodged complaints with BBMP officials, prompting them to visit the site frequently and harass him.On Wednesday morning, Murali left home around 6am, telling his family he was under pressure and that Usha and Shashi were “torturing” him. He went to the under-construction house and killed himself.Police have booked the couple under Sections 108 (abetment of suicide) and 308 (extortion) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS). A senior officer said preliminary inquiries show the Nambiars had filed multiple complaints since 2018, making Murali “run around BBMP offices, the police station, and local courts.”GBA officials confirmed they had issued Murali a notice asking him to appear before them on Wednesday. “Usha approached BBMP alleging violations. After a spot inspection, BBMP issued a notice,” the officer said. “The couple allegedly demanded Rs 20 lakh to stop harassing him.”Police said several locals have now come forward alleging that the Nambiars regularly filed complaints to extort money under the pretext of activism. “People in the area say many homes have faced similar harassment,” the officer said. “We request all affected residents to file complaints.”The friction between Murali and the Nambiars began soon after he purchased the land in 2018 — a conflict that, according to investigators, escalated over the years and ended with a devastating outcome.","Murali Govindaraju, a 45-year-old techie from Nallurahalli, died by suicide on Wednesday morning.

"Elgar Parishad case: After 5 years, Bombay HC gives bail to DU ex-professor Hany Babu Tharayil; 3 still in jail",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/elgar-parishad-case-after-5-years-ex-du-professor-hany-babu-gets-bail-3-more-in-jail/articleshow/125777780.cms,"Elgar Parishad: Babu among several people held | page 9

MUMBAI: The Bombay HC on Thursday granted bail to former Delhi University professor Hany Babu Tharayil (55), an accused in Elgar Parishad Maoist-links case in Pune.The bail came over 5 years after his arrest in 2020, in the 2018 case. It was granted on grounds of prolonged jail with trial completion not in sight. A bench of Justices A S Gadkari and R R Bhonsale said it was a well-settled legal principle that prolonged incarceration without trial amounts to infringement of right to life. ""Prolonged incarceration and unlikelihood of trial being completed in reasonable time or near future, necessitates a consequential release of the under trial on bail,"" it said. HC rejected NIA's plea for stay, saying Babu was in ""pretrial incarceration for over five years and seven months"".Babu faces charges under UAPA. With this, 12 of 16 accused arrested in the case will be out of prison. One of them, Fr Stan Swamy, died in 2021.Babu's plea to the court said he was a distinguished scholar in the field of linguistics with a doctorate from Central Institute of English and Foreign Languages, Hyderabad and at the time of his arrest, he was a professor at Delhi University with no criminal antecedents.Yug Chaudhry, his counsel, said he was seeking bail mainly due to prolonged incarceration, not on merits. He said after the high court passed its Sept 2022 bail rejection order, eight co-accused were released on bail by Supreme Court or high court, and he was seeking parity too.The case arose out of an FIR lodged first by the Vishrambaug police station in Pune in Jan 2018 for alleged inflammatory speeches at the Elgar Parishad event on New Year's Eve. In Jan 2020, the investigation was handed over to NIA with UAPA being invoked. On Dec 31, 2017, Elgar Parishad was organised at Shaniwarwada in Pune by Kabir Kala Manch, a left-leaning cultural outfit, and other organisations on the eve of the 200th anniversary of the battle of Koregaon Bhima near Pune. On Jan 1, 2018, caste clashes erupted at the Koregaon Bhima war memorial, resulting in the death of one person.In the months following the event, a number of people present at Elgar Parishad were arrested. This included activists Surendra Gadling, Rona Wilson, Mahesh Raut, Sudhir Dhawale, Shoma Sen and Fr Stan Swamy. It was alleged by police that the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist) had a hand in conducting the event. They said it instigated violence at Koregaon Bhima.On Feb 14, 2022, a special trial court rejected Babu's bail plea. On Sept 19 that year, the high court rejected a plea by Babu for bail on merits and observed that it found no perversity in the special trial court order rejecting his bail plea. The material placed before it by the NIA showed the accused ""was part of a larger conspiracy and abetted it"", the high court said then. On May 3, 2024, Babu, who went to Supreme Court, said he would approach the high court as there was a change of circumstance. The Supreme Court thus dismissed his appeal as ""not pressed for''.He applied again for bail citing the violation of his fundamental rights with the prolonged pre-trial incarceration and Supreme Court rulings that enable the grant of bail on such grounds.Three of the arrested still remain in custody - Gadling, and poet-singers Sagar Gorkhe and Ramesh Gaichor, who were arrested in 2020. Supreme Court on Dec 1, in a plea filed by Gadling, directed the state to ""endeavour for efficient functioning of the VC (video-conferencing)"" facility to enable his appearance digitally. It also directed the special NIA court to decide on or before Jan 15, 2026, an application filed by the prosecution for calling of record.","Hany Babu Tharayil is an accused in Elgar Parishad Maoist-links case in Pune.

Putin authorized 2018 Novichok attack on Skripal in 'reckless' display of power: UK inquiry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/putin-authorized-2018-novichok-attack-on-skripal-in-reckless-display-of-power-uk-inquiry/articleshow/125779661.cms,"'Ready To Strike…’: Putin’s All-Out War Alarm Pushes Germany To Load Doomsday Missile Shield

Inquiry findings



Russia’s response



How the attack unfolded



UK sanctions and diplomatic fallout



“A public statement”







Russian President Vladimir Putin had authorised the Novichok nerve agent attack on Russian double agent Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in March 2018, in a “reckless” display of power that led to the death of an innocent woman, according to the UK public inquiry.About four months later, mother-of-three Dawn Sturgess, 44, died from exposure to the poison after her partner found a counterfeit perfume bottle containing Novichok, which Russian spies had used to smuggle the military-grade nerve agent into the country, the inquiry said.Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found slumped unconscious on a public bench in the southern English city of Salisbury after Novichok was applied to the front door handle of his nearby home. The Skripals, and a police officer who attended the house, were left critically ill but recovered.In his conclusions, the chair, former UK Supreme Court judge Anthony Hughes, said he was certain a team of GRU military intelligence officers had attempted to murder Skripal, who sold Russian secrets to Britain and moved there after a 2010 spy swap.“I have concluded that the operation to assassinate Sergei Skripal must have been authorised at the highest level, by President Putin,” Hughes said in his report.“The evidence that this was a Russian state attack is overwhelming.”""The report concludes that the GRU is responsible for the death of a British national on UK soil after President Putin himself authorised the operation to poison the Skripal’s with deadly nerve agent Novichok. This Novichok was developed and held by Russia in contravention of the Chemical Weapons Convention. This subsequently resulted in the tragic death of Ms Sturgess,"" the report read.Russia has always denied any involvement, casting the accusations as anti-Russian propaganda. Responding to the report’s findings, the Russian embassy in London said in a statement on the Telegram app that its ambassador had visited Britain’s foreign ministry to “categorically reject baseless and senseless accusations, including those directed” against Putin. The embassy also accused London of seeking to “disrupt the accelerating negotiation process for a peaceful settlement of the conflict around Ukraine. ”Hughes said the two Russians who had smeared Novichok on Skripal’s door had discarded the bottle containing the poison without any regard to the danger it posed to innocent people. The inquiry was told the contaminated perfume bottle had contained enough poison to kill thousands of people. These “astonishingly reckless” actions meant the would-be assassins, their GRU superiors and those who authorised the attack, up to Putin himself, bore moral responsibility for Sturgess’ death, Hughes said.British police have already charged in absentia the three suspected members of the Russian hit team. On Thursday the govt announced new sanctions against the GRU intelligence agency and summoned the Russian ambassador over what it called Moscow’s “ongoing campaign of hostile activity.”Prime Minister Keir Starmer said: ""The Salisbury poisonings shocked the nation and today’s findings are a grave reminder of the Kremlin’s disregard for innocent lives. Dawn’s needless death was a tragedy and will forever be a reminder of Russia’s reckless aggression. My thoughts are with her family and loved ones.""""The UK will always stand up to Putin’s brutal regime and call out his murderous machine for what it is. Today’s sanctions are the latest step in our unwavering defence of European security, as we continue to squeeze Russia’s finances and strengthen Ukraine’s position at the negotiating table,"" he added.Hughes said Russia had an “increased risk appetite”, citing the annexation of Crimea and the downing of the Malaysia Airlines passenger jet, both in 2014, and said the attack was expected to stand as a vivid demonstration of Russian power.“The attack on Sergei Skripal by Russia was not, it seems clear, designed simply as revenge against him, but amounted to a public statement, for both international and domestic consumption, that Russia will act decisively in what it regards as its own interests,” the report said.Although Putin had previously denounced Skripal as a traitor, the inquiry said there was nothing to suggest the double agent had been imminently at risk or that more could have been done to protect him. Thursday’s report is the second major investigation to blame Putin for attacks on British soil against his perceived enemies. An inquiry in 2016 concluded that Putin had probably ordered the murder in London of Alexander Litvinenko, a Russian dissident and former agent of the FSB security service, using radioactive polonium-210.","Russian President Vladimir Putin had authorised the Novichok nerve agent attack on Russian double agent Sergei Skripal in Salisbury, a UK public inquiry has found.

"Dozens arrested in New Orleans ICE siege: Victims recount horrid experience, call it ‘racial profiling’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/dozens-arrested-in-new-orleans-ice-siege-victims-recount-horrid-experience-call-it-racial-profiling/articleshow/125779682.cms,"'SHUT DOWN ICE!': Angry Americans STORM Council Meeting, Clash With Cops | Louisiana





Dozens of people have been detained across the New Orleans area as the Trump administration’s latest large-scale federal immigration operation entered its second day, prompting fear, protests and allegations of racial profiling.Advocates told The Guardian that many immigrant families were in hiding as arrests took place in parking lots, on streets, at bus stops and outside major stores including Home Depot and Lowe’s.Rachel Taber of Unión Migrante shared a video with The Guardian showing masked border patrol agents questioning and handcuffing a man in a Lowe’s parking lot.When asked where he was born, the man replied, “I’m a US citizen.” The agent repeated the question, including in Spanish, before instructing a colleague to handcuff him. Taber said she was aware of at least three cases in which US citizens were detained for questioning and later released after proving their citizenship.CNN separately reported the case of a 22-year-old US-born mother who said federal agents chased her home from a grocery store. “I kept yelling at them, ‘I’m legal! I’m a US-born citizen! Please, leave me alone!’” she told the channel.Taber said agents were “not picking up criminals,” adding, “They’re picking up people off the streets, whoever they can catch – these are moms and dads coming home from work.”She described the detentions as “psychological warfare” and alleged, “They’re attacking people who haven’t committed any crime, it’s just the color of their skin. It’s just straight racial profiling.”The department of homeland security has said only that “dozens” of people have been detained as part of “Operation Catahoula Crunch,” highlighting six cases. In one instance, the only listed conviction was for vehicle theft and forging documents. The Trump administration maintains it is targeting “the worst of the worst.”The operation has prompted community mobilisation, emergency carpools for children of parents too afraid to leave their homes, and growing backlash from local officials. A New Orleans city council meeting was disrupted for nearly 30 minutes as protesters demanded stronger protections.Activists held signs reading “silence supports deportation” and “immigrants built and rebuilt this city,” urging officials to designate city property as ICE-free zones. Tensions rose after council president JP Morrell suspended public comments, leading to chants of “let the people speak” before police removed protesters.Advocates say the impact is already widespread. Businesses have reportedly seen fewer customers, and some residents are staying home to avoid encounters with federal agents. Taber likened the operation to a “siege” and said families now face difficult choices over work, school and even paying rent. “There are kids this Christmas who are not just going to be without presents, they’re going to be without parents,” she said.","Dozens of people have been detained across the New Orleans area as the Trump administration’s latest large-scale federal immigration operation entered its second day.

President Donald Trump has brought in a new architectural firm to lead the White House ballroom project after disagreements with the architect originally contracted for the job, several sources told CNN.One senior White House official said McCrery Architects and its CEO James McCrery would no longer be involved after clashing with the president over the scope and size of the ballroom. However, two other White House officials denied that McCrery was removed, saying he would stay on as a consultant.The new lead firm is Shalom Baranes Associates, a Washington, DC–based practice whose past work includes the general services administration’s national headquarters. Confirming the shift, White House spokesperson Davis Ingle said in a statement to CNN: “As we begin to transition into the next stage of development on the White House Ballroom, the Administration is excited to share that the highly talented Shalom Baranes has joined the team of experts to carry out President Trump’s vision on building what will be the greatest addition to the White House since the Oval Office - the White House Ballroom.” He added that Baranes’ experience “will be a great asset to the completion of this project.”CNN reported that tensions had built up in recent weeks over design disagreements between Trump and McCrery, including the size of the proposed structure and how closely it should align with the White House’s classic architectural style. The Washington Post earlier reported, citing four sources, that the dispute reflected a broader mismatch between Trump’s elaborate preferences and traditional design norms.The ballroom’s scale and cost have grown significantly since the initial announcement. The White House originally outlined a 90,000-square-foot hall with seating for 650 people at a cost of $200 million, funded fully by private donors. Trump later said the cost would rise to $300 million, in line with a larger structure, though the final dimensions remain unclear.The project has sparked criticism from preservationists after the administration tore down the entire East Wing without approval from the federal commission that oversees such construction.The White House has said it will submit the ballroom plans to the national capital planning commission but maintains the commission has no authority over the demolition itself. Will Scharf, who heads the commission and was appointed by Trump, said he has been informed that plans will be submitted this month.","The new lead firm is Shalom Baranes Associates, a Washington, DC–based practice whose past work includes the general services administration’s national headquarters.

US Vice President JD Vance criticised the European Union on Thursday over its expected move to fine X, saying the bloc should not penalise platforms for refusing to “engage in censorship.”In a post on X, Vance asked the EU to not target American firms over what he described as ‘garbage,’ and urged them to support ‘free speech.’“Rumors swirling that the EU commission will fine X hundreds of millions of dollars for not engaging in censorship. The EU should be supporting free speech, not attacking American companies over garbage,” he said.According to The Capitol Forum, the European Commission is preparing to issue its first-ever sanction under the Digital Services Act (DSA) in the coming days, and possibly as early as Friday. Two people with direct knowledge of the discussions told the Forum the final timing and size of the penalty were still being debated within the Commission.The expected fine is not related to content takedowns but to alleged violations on advertisement transparency, data access and deceptive design, the sources told The Capitol Forum. Last year, the Commission issued preliminary charges accusing X - formerly Twitter - of deceiving users through its blue checkmark system, arguing that the verification badge did not allow users to make informed choices about the accounts they interact with.The upcoming action is expected to be modest in size, but it would mark the EU’s first enforcement step under the DSA, a law that significantly expands obligations for large online platforms operating in the bloc.","US Vice President JD Vance criticised the European Union over its expected move to fine X.

Allie Beth Stuckey pushes back on Candace Owens’ claim





Candace Owens made a strong claim about Charlie Kirk . She said Charlie Kirk was “betrayed” by people inside Turning Point USA. She wrote on X that she is “fully confident” about this. She also said she will soon share proof and name the people she thinks hurt him. Owens told people who gave money to Turning Point USA that they should ask for a refund because “leadership knew.”Charlie Kirk, who was a well-known American political activist, was shot and killed on September 10 while speaking at Utah Valley University. He was doing a “Prove Me Wrong” talk at the campus when the shooting happened. After his death, Donald Trump said Charlie had once told him he might run for president one day.Owens’ new claim has brought a lot of attention because many people loved Charlie Kirk. Many want to know what she will say next. Many also want to see the proof she says she has. There is also tension inside the Turning Point USA community. This is because some people close to Charlie do not agree with Owens.A Christian influencer named Allie Beth Stuckey spoke out against Candace Owens. She talked about it on her show, Relatable. Stuckey said she did not want to answer Owens in public at first. But she said she felt hurt when Candace Owens suggested she “did not care” about who killed Charlie Kirk.Stuckey wrote on X that she cares deeply and wants the truth. She also said that “just asking questions” does not allow people to spread wrong claims.Allie Beth Stuckey said she wants Christians to look for truth in a fair way. She said words matter, and people should speak with care. Stuckey has been invited to take Charlie’s place on parts of his college tour. She has also appeared on the Charlie Kirk Show since his passing.While Allie Beth Stuckey spoke gently, Candace Owens made an even bigger claim. She said, “Charlie was betrayed. By everyone.” Her words have shocked many people who followed Charlie and his work.After Charlie Kirk’s death, his wife Erika Kirk became the new CEO of Turning Point USA. She said she wants to keep his work going.

""In June, Trump signed a proclamation banning citizens of 12 countries from entering the United States and restricting those from seven others, saying it was needed to protect against “foreign terrorists” and other security threats, Reuters reported.The bans applied to both immigrants and non-immigrants, such as tourists, students and business travellers.Noem did not specify which countries would be added to the list. “If they don’t have a stable government there, if they don’t have a country that can sustain itself and tell us who those individuals are and help us vet them, why should we allow people from that country to come here to the United States?” she said.Reuters previously reported that the Trump administration was considering banning citizens of 36 additional countries from entering the United States, according to an internal State Department cable.An expansion of the list would mark a further escalation of migration measures the administration had taken since the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, DC, last week.Investigators said the shooting was carried out by an Afghan national who entered the US in 2021 through a resettlement programme under which Trump administration officials have argued there was insufficient vetting. Days after the shooting, Trump vowed to “permanently pause” migration from all “Third World Countries,” although he did not identify any by name or define “third-world countries.”Prior to that, officials from the Department of Homeland Security said Trump had ordered a widespread review of asylum cases approved under the administration of his predecessor, Democratic President Joe Biden, and Green Cards issued to citizens of 19 countries. Since returning to office in January, Trump has aggressively prioritised immigration enforcement, sending federal agents to major US cities and turning away asylum seekers at the US-Mexico border. His administration has frequently highlighted the deportation push, but until now it has put less emphasis on efforts to reshape legal immigration.","US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the president is 'continuing to evaluate countries' In June, President Donald Trump signed a proclamation banning citizens of 12 countries from entering the United States.

Disturbing look into the world of Jeffrey Epstein and his island





House Democrats on the Oversight Committee released a new batch of photographs taken inside Jeffrey Epstein ’s private Caribbean island or the famous ""Epstein Island.""The committee said the new images had never been seen publicly before. They were captured on Little St. James in the US Virgin Islands. They include photographs of bedrooms, bathrooms and a room containing a dentist’s chair, with masks displayed on the wall.Another image shows a landline telephone with several first names written next to the speed-dial buttons, partly redacted. A study in one of the photos contains a blackboard with words scrawled across it, including “power,” “deception,” “plots” and “political.”Videos show the exterior grounds of the island home, which resembles a luxury resort. The material also features a swimming pool, palm trees and a long pathway overlooking the sea. Committee Democrats said the redactions in some images were made to remove women’s names for privacy.“These new images are a disturbing look into the world of Jeffrey Epstein and his island. We are releasing these photos and videos to ensure public transparency in our investigation and to help piece together the full picture of Epstein’s horrific crimes,” said Representative Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the committee.The release comes shortly after US President Donald Trump signed a law requiring the Department of Justice (DOJ) to disclose the Epstein-related documents it holds. Those files are expected to be released in the coming days with a lot on line.Epstein privately owned Little St. James and the neighbouring Great St. James. The regions are described as central to his trafficking operation. Victims have detailed how Epstein used the islands to isolate them and host powerful visitors.The islands were sold to billionaire investor Stephen Deckoff in 2023, according to CNN.Investigators are also seeking testimony from Epstein’s former associate and right-hand woman Ghislaine Maxwell , who is serving 20 years in a low-security prison.","House Democrats on the Oversight Committee released a new batch of photographs taken inside Jeffrey Epstein ’s private Caribbean island or the famous ""Epstein Island"" The committee said the new images had never been seen publicly before.

'Kill all' for 'martyrdom': How Pakistani immigrant allegedly planned to attack US University of Delaware police campus,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kill-all-for-martyrdom-how-pak-immigrant-allegedly-planned-to-attack-us-university-of-delaware-police-campus-details/articleshow/125756393.cms,"Source: New Castle County Police

Who is Luqmaan Khan?







A Pakistan-origin man studying at the University of Delaware was arrested after police discovered a large collection of guns, ammunition and body armour, along with a manifesto that allegedly described plans to ""kill all"" and seek ""martyrdom"" in a mass shooting on the University campus, The New York Post reported.Police arrested 25-year-old Luqmaan Khan just before midnight on November 24. Officers found him sitting in his pickup truck in a park after closing hours, and decided to search the vehicle because he was acting suspiciously.Inside the truck, officers allegedly found a .357 Glock pistol, several loaded 27-round magazines, body-armor plates, binoculars, a laptop and a marble composition notebook. Prosecutors said the pistol had been placed into a kit that turned it into a semi-automatic rifle.The police also recovered a notebook reportedly describing a plan to attack his former school’s campus police department, including a drawn-out map of the police headquarters with marked entry and exit points. The plan included evading law enforcement team after attack.ABC 6 reported that the writings included phrases like “kill all – martyrdom,” explained how to escape after the attack, and described how several weapons would be used.Police said the notes clearly showed “premeditated assault plans” and “warfare techniques.”The exact reason for the planned attack is still unknown, but Khan allegedly told police after his arrest that becoming a martyr was “one of the greatest things you can do.”“This case is a quintessential example of federal and state law enforcement collaborating to neutralize a grave threat to Delaware before the worst could come to pass. I want to thank our dedicated law enforcement partners at the FBI and the NCCPD for their exceptional work. As always, we are proud to work with them to keep Delaware safe,” said Acting US Attorney Murray.One campus police officer was specifically mentioned in the notes, but the reason is not yet known.Police told The Post that Khan was born in Pakistan but has lived in the United States since he was a “youth,” and he is now an American citizen.After his arrest, the FBI searched his home in Wilmington and found even more weapons. Agents recovered an AR-style rifle with a red-dot scope and another Glock pistol, which had an illegal device that turned it into a fully automatic machine gun capable of firing 1,200 rounds per minute.Khan was taken to the New Castle County Police Headquarters and charged with resisting arrest, carrying a concealed deadly weapon, multiple weapon violations and related offenses.He was arraigned, given a $107,200 cash bail, and then handed over to the FBI, which may file additional charges.","Luqmaan Khan, 25, was arrested after police found a large collection of guns, ammunition and body armour in his truck.

An F-16 fighter jet assigned to the US Air Force Thunderbirds, the service’s elite aerial demonstration team, went down Wednesday morning in a Southern California desert.The cause of the crash was not immediately known. Officials said the jet went down around 10:45 a.m. during a training flight in controlled airspace.Video posted to X by DisasterAlert shows the pilot making what appears to be a lucky escape, drifting slowly toward the ground beneath a parachute.Later military officials said the pilot ejected just before impact and survived.The pilot was listed in stable condition and is receiving medical treatment, Staff Sgt. Jovante Johnson, an Air Force spokesperson, confirmed in an email Wednesday, New York Times reported.A wide plume of dark smoke was visible after the plane went down near Trona Airport in San Bernardino County. The jet was part of the US Air Force Thunderbirds, the military’s official aerial demonstration team, according to the social media post. The cause of the crash remains unclear.The approximate cost of a US Air Force F-16C Fighting Falcon is around $20 million. “A Thunderbird pilot ejected safely from an F-16C Fighting Falcon aircraft during a training mission over controlled airspace in California,” a release from the US Air Force Air Demonstration Squadron said.The Thunderbirds operate out of Nellis Air Force Base near Las Vegas, roughly 200 miles east of where the crash occurred.The team is renowned for its high-risk aerial stunts and razor-sharp precision, thrilling millions of spectators since its formation in 1953.During certain maneuvers — with names like the opposing knife-edge pass and the delta loop — the F-16 jets fly as close as 18 inches apart.","The jet went down around 10:45 a.m. during a training flight in controlled airspace.

Grand jury rejects justice department's bid to revive criminal case against New York Attorney General Letitia James,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/grand-jury-rejects-justice-departments-bid-to-revive-criminal-case-against-new-york-attorney-general-letitia-james/articleshow/125777872.cms,"



A federal grand jury on Thursday rejected prosecutors’ attempt to revive a criminal case against New York Attorney General Letitia James, Reuters reported.The decision came after US District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie threw out an initial set of charges, finding in November that the prosecutor who secured that indictment, Lindsey Halligan, was unlawfully appointed.The indictment would have marked the Justice Department’s second attempt to prosecute James, an elected Democrat and prominent critic of President Donald Trump. Prosecutors plan to seek a new indictment, the two sources added. A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment.Prosecutors rarely struggle to obtain indictments from grand juries, since the govt alone presents evidence and must only show probable cause that a crime was committed. Grand juries have rejected several proposed charges during Trump’s second term, but James is the most high-profile rejection yet.James is one of three high-profile Trump critics hit with federal criminal charges in recent months, along with former FBI Director James Comey and John Bolton, a former Trump national security adviser. Currie also dismissed the case against Comey, ruling that Halligan’s appointment as interim U.S.attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia was impermissible. Bolton pleaded not guilty to federal charges brought in Maryland.James initially pleaded not guilty to charges of bank fraud and lying to a financial institution. The initial indictment accused her of misleading on mortgage documents to secure more favourable loan terms for a home she owns in Norfolk, Virginia.Trump has long assailed James over a civil fraud case she brought against him and his family business, which resulted in a more than Rs 3,735 crore (approx) penalty after a judge found in 2024 that Trump fraudulently overstated his net worth to dupe lenders. A New York state appeals court in August threw out the penalty, which had grown to more than half a billion dollars with interest, but upheld the trial judge’s finding that Trump was liable for fraud. Both Trump and James’ office are appealing to the state’s highest court.A California doctor was sentenced to 2½ years in prison on Wednesday for illegally supplying ‘Friends’ sitcom star Matthew Perry with ketamine.","A federal grand jury rejected prosecutors’ attempt to revive a criminal case against New York Attorney General Letitia James.

The leaders of the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda signed a peace deal on Thursday aimed at ending years of conflict in the region at a summit hosted by US President Donald Trump in Washington.The ceremony took place amid a recent surge in fighting in eastern DR Congo between government forces and M23 rebels, who are believed to have Rwandan support. DR Congo’s army accused the rebels of trying to ""sabotage"" the peace process, while M23 claimed the army had launched an offensive in breach of a ceasefire. Earlier this year, the rebels seized large areas of eastern DR Congo, causing thousands of deaths and forcing many civilians from their homes.At the start of the event at the newly-renamed Donald J Trump Institute of Peace, Trump called the signing a ""great day"" for Africa and the world. ""I have a lot of confidence in both leaders,"" he said. ""We'll keep these commitments. I know they're going to keep them and follow through on the agreement and create a much brighter future for the people of their countries.""DR Congo’s President Felix Tshisekedi and Rwandan President Paul Kagame endorsed the deal.Other African leaders in attendance included officials from Kenya, Angola, Burundi, Togo, and Uganda. Trump also invited US secretary of state Marco Rubio, along with foreign ministers from Qatar and the UAE, according to the BBC.Kagame praised Trump as an ""even-handed"" leader who is ""never taking sides."" He also called Trump's approach pragmatic, giving the region ""the clearest and most viable path forward that we have ever had.""Meanwhile, Tshisekedi expressed ""deep gratitude and clear hope"" and that he expects Rwanda to ""respect the letter and spirit of the deal.""The US has been spearheading talks with the hope that resolving tensions between DR Congo and Rwanda will pave the way for economic investment in the resource-rich region. Trump said the US will send ""some of our biggest and greatest companies over to the two countries"" and extract valuable minerals, promising that ""everybody's going to make a lot of money.""","The leaders of the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda signed a peace deal on Thursday.

He stands accused of placing pipe bombs near the DNC and RNC offices just before the Capitol riot on January 6th.

$500,000 reward and dead ends

The arrest





After 5 years of a manhunt, federal authorities finally arrested Brian Cole, the man accused of placing pipe bombs near the Democratic and Republican National Committee offices the night before the Jan 6 Capitol riot. Cole was living in Woodbridge, Virginia, before he was taken into custody.On the evening of 5 January 2021, Cole allegedly placed two homemade pipe bombs near the DNC and RNC headquarters. The devices were made from 1×8‑inch galvanized metal pipes, filled with homemade black powder, and fitted with a kitchen timer for detonation. Neither device exploded, but officials described them as capable of causing serious injury or death.Surveillance footage captured the suspect wearing Nike shoes, a dark hoodie, and glasses, reportedly carrying a backpack containing the bombs. The devices were later found and safely recovered by the FBI.For almost five years, authorities struggled to identify the individual in the grainy, low-quality surveillance images. Investigators reviewed tens of thousands of video files, interviewed hundreds of witnesses, and analysed digital and geolocation data to determine where the suspect actually went after planting the bombs.A $500,000 reward was issued to any person who would provide helpful details about the criminal. But it was all for nothing.Lawmakers questioned how security failures allowed the bombs to remain undetected for nearly 17 hours. The FBI continued to release updated video footage and physical descriptions, estimating the suspect at around 5′7″ tall.The breakthrough came in December 2025, when investigators were able to link new forensic evidence and video analysis to Brian Cole. Authorities executed a warrant at his home in Woodbridge, taking him into custody without incident. Formal charges have not yet been publicly released, but officials confirmed the arrest closes one of the longest-running mysteries tied to the January 6 riots.","Brian Cole was living in Woodbridge, Virginia, before he was taken into custody.

"Colombian man killed by US strikes in Caribbean was fishing for tuna, not trafficking drugs; human rights lawyer makes big claim",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/colombian-man-killed-by-us-strikes-in-caribbean-was-fishing-for-tuna-not-trafficking-drugs-human-rights-lawyer-makes-big-claim/articleshow/125769842.cms,"



The family of a Colombian fisherman killed in a US strike in the Caribbean has filed a formal complaint against such attacks with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.The petition was filed on Tuesday by US human rights lawyer Dan Kovalik. It alleges that Alejandro Carranza was killed when the United States struck his boat off the coast of Colombia on September 15. Kovalik told CNN that the family seeks compensation and an end to similar killings: “These killings are against international law. They are against US law. We want this to stop, and we think this is at least a first step to having that happen.”The complaint names US secretary of defence Pete Hegseth as responsible for ordering the bombing of boats like Carranza’s and claimed that his conduct was ratified by US President Donald Trump.Since early September, US has carried out at least 22 strikes on alleged drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean and Pacific, killing at least 83 people. The US maintains the strikes comply with the Law of Armed Conflict and has said the boats were linked to armed drug cartels. Trump claimed that the September 15 strike killed three “narcoterrorists from Venezuela” transporting drugs to the United States.However, Kovalik says Carranza was simply fishing for marlin and tuna when he was killed. “That is what he was doing. That was his profession and his vocation.” Colombian President Gustavo Petro has described Carranza as a lifelong fisherman with no ties to the drug trade. He added that Carranza may have occasionally carried prohibited goods due to financial pressures, but ""his actions don't deserve the death penalty. ”Kovalik has also represented President Petro, who was sanctioned by the US on October 24 over alleged involvement in the global drug trade. Petro has denied the allegations.",The family of a Colombian fisherman killed in a US strike in the Caribbean has filed a formal complaint.
