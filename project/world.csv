JNU Clash: Student Union President Among 28 Detained, 6 Cops Injured During Protest Against ABVP





NEW DELHI: In a decisive victory, the Left Unity panel swept all four central posts in the Jawaharlal Nehru University Students' Union (JNUSU) elections for 2025-26 on Thursday, with Aditi Mishra of AISA becoming the university's first woman president since Aishe Ghosh in 2019. The results mark a strong comeback for the Left, which had lost one post to ABVP in the delayed 2024-25 polls this April.Mishra, a PhD student from Centre for Comparative Politics and Political Theory, secured 1,937 votes, defeating ABVP's Vikas Patel, who polled 1,488 votes. The margin of 449 votes is up from 272 recorded in the April poll.The presidential candidate of Progressive Students' Association (PSA), Shinde Vijayalaxmi Vyankat Rao, who gained traction among voters with her fiery presidential speech targeting both left and right politics on the campus, took away 1,276 votes while NSUI trailed with 419 votes.In the vice-presidential race, Left's K Gopika Babu from SFI registered the highest tally across all posts, winning by a massive margin of 1,314, up from 34 in the April poll. She secured 3,101 votes while ABVP's Tanya Kumari got 1,787 and NSUI's Shaikh Shahnawaz Alam 370.For the post of general secretary, Left's Sunil Yadav from DSF won by 104 votes, a little dip from April's 114, polling 2,005 votes against ABVP's Rajeshwar Kant Dubey's 1,901.The joint secretary's post was also clinched by Left, with Danish Ali securing 2,083 votes and defeating ABVP's Anuj Damra (1,797) by a margin of 286 votes. In the previous poll, ABVP had bagged this post with a margin of 45.This year's election saw 20 candidates in the fray for the four central panel posts, including six woman candidates, reflecting an increase in women's participation in the campus politics.During the early rounds of counting, when about 4,300 votes were tallied, ABVP was leading on two seats — general secretary and joint secretary. However, once votes from School of Social Sciences and School of Languages were opened, Left secured the lead on all posts. Both these centres have historically voted overwhelmingly for Left candidates.The day-long counting unfolded amid high-decibel sloganeering, drum beats and bursts of celebration as each round was declared. Late at night, tensions briefly flared when a group of students carrying Palestine flags clashed with ABVP supporters. Students alleged that ABVP members tore a flag while ABVP denied the charge, claiming the group had raised anti-govt slogans.Observers say the results reaffirm the united Left's dominance on the campus. The outcome also signals that while new entrants like PSA have injected energy into the campus discourse, the traditional Left remains the primary force shaping student politics at JNU, they add.",The Left Unity panel swept all four central posts in the Jawaharlal Nehru University Students' Union (JNUSU) elections for 2025-26 on Thursday.

Top Bengaluru Jail Official Transferred, 2 Suspended After Viral Videos Spark Outrage





BENGALURU: Yet another video from Bengaluru Central Prison has surfaced on social media, deepening the ongoing controversy over illegal activities inside the high-security facility.The new clip, allegedly recorded inside the Parappana Agrahara jail, shows inmates partying, dancing, and drinking liquor and consuming non-vegetarian food while using plates and mugs as makeshift musical instruments according to news agency PTI.The video which went viral on Sunday shows disposable glasses filled with alcohol arranged alongside plates of cut fruits and fried peanuts. Inmates can be seen cheering, shouting, and dancing to the clanging of utensils, turning the barrack into what appears to be a party zone.The emergence of this new footage comes close on the heels of earlier videos showing high-profile inmates, including serial rapist Umesh Reddy and Islamic State (IS) handler Juhad Hamid Shakil Manna, using mobile phones and watching television inside the same prison.Those videos — some recorded as far back as 2023 — had triggered a massive row, exposing lapses in jail surveillance and control.Reacting to the fresh video, home minister G Parameshwara said the government would take “stringent action against officials, including jail superintendents” for the repeated lapses inside Bengaluru Central Prison.""If the report is not satisfactory, I will constitute a committee to investigate the matter. We will take action against the officials concerned and implement corrective measures to prevent such incidents in the future. I will not tolerate this nonsense — enough is enough,” Parameshwara said.He added that the state government had already approved the installation of CCTVs and mobile jammers in prisons to prevent such violations, but the measures were not fully implemented.“Despite repeated incidents from Parappana Agrahara jail, the problem persists. Though mobile jammers and CCTVs have been approved for installation to prevent such violations, the prisons have failed to implement them,” he said.Officials from the prison department said ADGP (Prisons) B Dayananda has ordered a high-level probe to identify the source of the leaked videos, those responsible for smuggling phones and liquor inside, and any officials complicit in the racket. Additional inspector general of police (prisons) PV Anand Reddy also visited the jail premises to assess the situation.A senior prison officer described the incident as a “major security breach,” warning that the use of mobile phones by terror suspects could allow them to contact handlers of banned outfits or radicalise other inmates.The Bengaluru Central Prison has frequently been in the spotlight for misconduct — from actor Darshan Thoogudeepa allegedly being allowed to use phones and smoke on the lawn, to gold smuggling case accused Ranya Rao’s associate Tarun Raju being filmed with a mobile phone earlier this year.","Video from Bengaluru Central Prison shows inmates partying with liquor and makeshift instruments.

Terror Angle in Delhi Blast Not Ruled Out: PM Modi Briefed, Home Minister Amit Shah Calls NIA, NSG

NEW DELHI: No craters, no shrapnel or pellets - this was the first impression of the forensic and anti-terror experts who arrived at the spot after the car bomb explosion near the Red Fort on Monday evening. While it puzzled the investigators, a plausible explanation soon emerged with some experts saying that it was possible that a crater may not be formed if the car was in motion.""It could be a highly inflammable chemical, which may have caused the casualties. It's a high-end explosive material,"" said a source, hinting at the possible use of a mixture of ammonium nitrate and RDX. However, a detailed blast analysis report will confirm or deny these theories, he added. A possible link with the Faridabad seizure was also being actively explored.All angles are being probed and National Investigation Agency is likely to take over the probe into the FIR, which was being filed by Delhi Police late on Monday.The initial probe led police to a man named Salman from Gurgaon, who allegedly owned the 'HR 26 7674' i20 car involved in the blast. He told police that he had sold the car to someone named Devendra in March. Police then contacted the RTO to fetch further details of the sellers.Fictitious IDs were used and one of them was also of a Pulwama resident, said a cop.However, the multiplicity of ownership of the vehicle raised eyebrows as this was a preferred modus operandi of terrorist groups while choosing a vehicle for SVB-IED (suicide vehicle-borne improvised explosive device) attacks.As there were at least three people in the car, police suspect that there may be a possibility that it was a hired/rented car because suicide attacks usually involve one-two persons.A crucial aspect, as also pointed out by home minister Amit Shah, is the analysis of footage from over 230 CCTV cameras. While it has helped police establish the route taken by the vehicle, it also provided them with the registration number.Investigators are grappling with many unanswered questions, including the presence of three people in the car and its outstation numberplate.","No craters, no shrapnel or pellets - this was the first impression of the forensic and anti-terror experts who arrived at the spot after the car bomb explosion near the Red Fort on Monday evening.

Delhi Red Fort Blast: First lead to terror plot came from Jaish posters in Kashmir,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/first-lead-to-terror-plot-came-from-jaish-posters-in-kashmir/articleshow/125235085.cms,"Security personnel on guard in Anantnag following the arrest of Kulgam resident Dr Adeel, accused in an interstate terror module

NEW DELHI: The first lead in J&K police's investigation into Jaish-e-Muhammed's multi-state terror network involving Kashmiri doctors - now busted with nine arrests and a massive haul of over 2,900 kgs of explosives, bomb-making material and two AK-series weapons so far - was as innocuous as a set of Jaish posters that had come up secretly in Nowgam, Srinagar in mid-October.The Jaish posters threatening attacks on security forces - common until 2019 but a rare occurrence now - fuelled the curiosity of Srinagar SSP G V Sundeep Chakravarthy, who had also led the J&K police component in Operation Mahadev that neutralised the three Pahalgam attackers. He insisted on finding out who put up the posters; and CCTV camera footage nailed three overground workers with a history of stone-pelting.They were arrested and their interrogation led the police to a cleric in Shopian, Maulvi Irfan Ahmad. Irfan's questioning would, over the next 2-3 weeks, unveil a sinister Jaish plot - with links across J&K, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh - leading to a string of arrests.Those arrested so far include Kashmiri doctors working at Faridabad's Al-Falah University, Muzammil Ganaie hailing from Pulwama; Adeel Ahmad Rather, originally from Qazigund but picked up from Saharanpur; and Dr Shaheen Sayeed hailing from Lucknow and Muzammil's purported girlfriend.A fourth doctor, Dr Umar, who hails from Pulwama, is however absconding.Also in custody are the three overground workers behind the Nowgam posters; Hafiz Mohd Ishtiyak, a Mewat cleric who arranged the logistics in Faridabad; Maulvi Irfan and his aide from Ganderbal Zameer Ahmad Ahanger alias Mutlasha who led the J&K police to Muzammil.Though Maulvi was not talking initially, a mobile device picked up from his house showed a Telegram channel operated by Pakistan-based Jaish terrorist Umar bin Khattab, confirming that he was in touch with Irfan.One of Irfan's terror recruits, Mutlasha, also came under the scanner for being part of another pan-India terror chat group by the name Farzandan e Darul Uloom Deoband. Irfan eventually said he had seen an AK-47 in the house of a doctor he had radicalised. Mutlasha confirmed the identity of the doctor as Dr Muzammil Ganaie. Muzammil was traced to Al-Falah University in Faridabad, Haryana, where he was working with Dr Adeel and Dr Umar.Though interrogation is underway to establish how these explosives were to be used, investigators suspect a conspiracy to carry out terror attacks in the hinterland, with Delhi an obvious target given its proximity to Faridabad. ""Idea was to use the cover of being medical professionals to escape suspicion. Given the massive quantity of explosives and other bomb-making material, it seems they were collected over two years,"" an officer connected with the investigation told TOI.","J&K police's investigation into Jaish-e-Muhammed's multi-state terror network involving Kashmiri doctors busted with nine arrests.

Faridabad Terror Plot: Woman Doctor Arrested After AK-47 Recovery, Experts Hint at Pakistan Link

Cops probing if Faridabad univ lab was used for making RDX

GURGAON/SRINAGAR: A Kashmiri medical professor's arrest has triggered one of the largest counterterrorism hauls in recent years, with investigators in J&K, Haryana and UP uncovering nearly 2,900kg of IED-making material, multiple assault rifles, pistols, chemicals, electronics and flammable substances.Police said a transnational module tied to Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind had allegedly embedded itself within academic and professional circles, using encrypted channels, charitable fronts and university networks to move funds, radicalise recruits and assemble explosives. The investigation began after threatening JeM posters appeared at several locations in Srinagar's Bunpora Nowgam area on Oct 19.An FIR under UAPA, Explosive Substances Act, and Arms Act was filed at Nowgam police station. Tracking the trail led police to what they described as a ""white-collar terror ecosystem"" of radicalised professionals and students allegedly in touch with handlers in Pakistan and other countries.Muzamil Shakeel, 35, a doctor from J&K's Pulwama teaching at Al-Falah University in Faridabad's Dhauj, was arrested October 30 after J&K police linked him to the posters. He managed the university hospital's emergency wing and taught medical students.His questioning led Haryana and J&K police to two rented locations in Dhauj. Searches on Saturday at a room he allegedly took 15 days before his arrest yielded 358kg of suspected ammonium nitrate, a Krinkov assault rifle with three magazines, 83 live cartridges, a pistol, & bomb-making paraphernalia.Searches on Saturday at a room Muzamil Shakeel allegedly took 15 days before his arrest yielded arms, ammunition, explosive material and bomb-making paraphernalia: 12 suitcases and a bucket packed with explosives, 20 timers, batteries, remote controls, 5kg heavy metal, and a walkie-talkie set.Searches expanded Monday to Dehar Colony, also in Dhauj, where police found an additional 2,563kg of explosives and flammable material. Seized weapons include a Chinese pistol, a Beretta pistol, an AK-56 rifle, and a Krinkov rifle - all with ammunition. ""The sheer volume of material points to plans for large-scale terrorist attacks,"" a police officer said.Faridabad police spokesperson Yashpal said teams were working to identify accomplices, trace procurement chains, and determine the weapons' source. ""Raids are being carried out at multiple locations linked to the accused,"" he said.Investigators have detained several people allegedly connected to Muzamil, including a religious scholar from a mosque near the university. Police said they are probing whether laboratory facilities at Al-Falah University were intended for synthesising advanced explosives such as RDX.An AK-47 allegedly linked to Muzamil was found in the Swift Dzire of a woman doctor from the same university. Officers said she has not been arrested and may have loaned her vehicle without knowing its use, but her role remains under scrutiny. She is currently being questioned in J&K.Before Muzamil's arrest, UP's Saharanpur police detained another Pulwama doctor - Adeel Majeed Rather. His interrogation led investigators to Dhauj and uncovered Muzamil's alleged storage facility.Faridabad police commissioner Satender Kumar Gupta said a terrorist module was being designed. ""Though I cannot reveal much as it concerns national security, joint teams of Haryana and J&K police have successfully busted a major terrorist network,"" he said, adding that more arrests were expected.J&K police announced a broader breakthrough, calling it a ""major counterterrorism operation"" that dismantled an inter-state and transnational module linked to JeM and AGuH. Arrests include Arif Nisar Dar alias Sahil and Yasir-ul-Ashraf of Nowgam, Maqsood Ahmad Dar alias Shahid of Nowgam, Molvi Irfan Ahmad of Shopian, Zameer Ahmad Ahanger of Ganderbal, Dr Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie of Koil in Pulwama, and Dr Rather of Kulgam. Searches were carried out across Srinagar, Anantnag, Ganderbal, and Shopian, along with coordinated operations in Faridabad and Saharanpur.""Financial investigation regarding flow of funds is on and all linkages are being traced and addressed expeditiously,"" police said, adding that the operation reflects determination to dismantle alleged terrorist networks operating across state lines and from foreign soil.","Muzamil Shakeel, 35, a doctor from J&K's Pulwama teaching at Al-Falah University in Faridabad's Dhauj, was arrested October 30.

Doctor Linked To ISIS-Khorasan Held For Plotting Ricin Mass Attack Across Major Indian Cities

AHMEDABAD: A 35-year-old Hyderabad doctor arrested in Gujarat with drone-smuggled weapons from Pakistan and materials to produce the deadly toxin ricin was identified Sunday as the central figure in an IS-sponsored terrorist plot to strike multiple Indian cities.Two other suspects in the conspiracy, a tailor from Uttar Pradesh's Shamli and a student from Lakhimpur Kheri, were traced to Banaskantha.Gujarat Police's Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) caught Ahmed Mohiyuddin Saiyed on Nov 8 with two Glock pistols, a Beretta, 30 live cartridges and 4 kg of castor-bean mash, from which ricin is extracted.He was on the move when investigators intercepted his silver hatchback at Adalaj toll plaza on Ahmedabad-Mehsana Road.Saiyed's call records led to the arrest of UP natives Azad Suleman Sheikh, 20, and Mohammad Suhail Mohammad Saleem Khan, 23. Both had been allegedly supplying firearms and cartridges to the doctor, who has an MBBS from China, officials said.Ricin is a highly toxic poison derived from castor beans after the oil has been extracted. The substance has no known antidote if ingested, inhaled or injected. Castor oil, which is used for skincare and in various commercial products, does not contain the toxin.ATS officers said Saiyed had been in contact with Abu Khadija, an Afghanistan-based operative linked to Islamic State-Khorasan Province. The doctor had been allegedly producing ricin in large quantities, possibly for mass poisoning, he said.The suspect conducted reconnaissance of unspecified security-sensitive sites in Lucknow, Delhi and Ahmedabad. The weapons came from Hanumangarh in Rajasthan. Saiyed and the other arrested men told interrogators that their handler used drones from Pakistan to deliver arms across the border.Deputy SP SL Chaudhary led the operation to bust the module based on initial intelligence about Saiyed's movements in Ahmedabad.An FIR was registered at the ATS police station against all three arrested men and Abu Khadija, who is on the run, under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and Arms Act. A local court gave ATS custody of Saiyed until Nov 17. The other two suspects will be produced in court separately. ATS officials said investigations were continuing to identify and arrest other operatives involved in the conspiracy.","Gujarat Police's Anti-Terrorism Squad caught Ahmed Mohiyuddin Saiyed on Nov 8 with two Glock pistols, a Beretta, 30 live cartridges and 4 kg of castor-bean mash.

NEW DELHI: In a major breakthrough against terror networks operating, the Jammu and Kashmir Police, in coordination with Haryana Police, on Monday uncovered a large cache of explosives and arms from an apartment in Haryana’s Faridabad. Officials confirmed that 360 kg of suspected ammonium nitrate, along with 2,900 kg of IED-making material, including chemicals, detonators, wires, and other bomb-making components, were seized.Two persons — Dr Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie, an assistant professor at Al-Falah University, Faridabad, and Dr Adil Ahmad Rather, a doctor from Pulwama — were arrested in connection with the seizure. The operation, which had been under surveillance for over two weeks, is being described as one of the biggest terror-related recoveries in the Delhi-NCR region in recent years.According to Faridabad Commissioner of Police Satender Kumar Gupta, the seizure resulted from a coordinated effort between the Jammu and Kashmir Police and Haryana Police. “It is an ongoing joint operation between Haryana police and J&K police. An accused, Dr Muzammil, was nabbed. 360 kg of inflammable material was recovered yesterday, which is possibly ammonium nitrate. It is not RDX... The operation is still underway,” Gupta told reporters.Officials said the materials recovered from the apartment included a variety of electronic and explosive components, indicating preparation for potential large-scale attacks.“One assault rifle with three magazines and 83 live rounds, one pistol with eight live rounds, two empty cartridges, two additional magazines, eight large suitcases, four small suitcases, and a bucket containing approximately 360 kg of inflammable material have been recovered. It is suspected to be ammonium nitrate,” said Gupta.The police also recovered 20 timers with batteries, 24 remote controls, walkie-talkie sets, 5 kg of heavy metal, electronic wiring, and contraband materials. “It is not RDX... It is not an AK-47; it is an assault rifle. It is like an AK-47 but slightly smaller than it. But it is not AK-47,” Gupta clarified.Sources told The Times of India that the Faridabad raid followed crucial leads developed by Jammu and Kashmir Police during a separate investigation in Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh. Dr Adil Ahmad Rather, arrested earlier in that operation, reportedly confessed to the presence of the explosive cache and identified his associate Dr Muzammil.Gupta confirmed, “Two accused persons have been booked until now, including Dr Muzsammil from Faridabad, and another accused, Aadil Rather, has been arrested from J&K’s Saharanpur.”Police sources said an AK-47 rifle was earlier recovered from Rather’s locker at the Government Medical College in Srinagar. The interrogation of Rather helped investigators trace the Faridabad apartment where the explosives were stored.In a related crackdown, the Jammu and Kashmir Police, as per an official statement, dismantled an inter-state and transnational terror module associated with proscribed organisations Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind (AGuH).According to the police statement, “The operation has led to the arrest of key operatives and the recovery of a massive cache of arms, ammunition, and explosives during coordinated searches in J&K and other states.”The recovered materials included 2,900 kg of IED-making material, consisting of chemicals, reagents, inflammable materials, and electronic components. Searches were conducted across Srinagar, Anantnag, Ganderbal, and Shopian, as well as in Faridabad and Saharanpur in coordination with local police.The statement said, “Financial investigations regarding the flow of funds are ongoing, and all linkages are being traced and addressed expeditiously.”Investigations revealed that the arrested individuals were part of a “white-collar terror ecosystem” that involved radicalised professionals, including doctors and academics, allegedly operating under instructions from foreign handlers in Pakistan.The J&K Police statement read, “The group has been using encrypted channels for indoctrination, coordination, fund movement, and logistics. Funds were raised through professional and academic networks under the guise of social and charitable causes.”The seven individuals arrested by J&K Police include Arif Nisar Dar alias Sahil, Yasir-ul-Ashraf, Maqsood Ahmad Dar alias Shahid, Molvi Irfan Ahmad, Zameer Ahmad Ahanger, Dr Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie, and Dr Adeel of Kulgam.Officials said that the network was working to identify potential recruits for radicalisation, raise funds, and arrange logistics for preparing improvised explosive devices (IEDs).“The accused were involved in identifying persons to radicalize, initiate, and recruit into terrorist ranks, besides raising funds, arranging logistics, and procuring arms, ammunition, and materials for preparing IEDs,” the police said.Investigators are currently tracing the flow of funds and communications to determine the extent of involvement of foreign handlers.The J&K Police confirmed the recovery of one Chinese Star pistol, one Beretta pistol, one AK-56 rifle, and a Krinkov rifle, along with a significant quantity of ammunition. The arms are believed to have been procured through smuggling routes facilitated by operatives based across the border.The police said that these recoveries, coupled with the seizure in Faridabad, “are a testimony to the diligent efforts and unflagging determination of the concerned team.”Former Jammu and Kashmir DGP SP Vaid, speaking to ANI, linked the Faridabad recovery to Pakistan’s “deep state.” He said, “I think they were planning a terror action in the interior of the country. That’s why this huge recovery of explosive material, ammonium nitrate or whatever it is, with an assault rifle in a joint operation by J&K and Faridabad police.”He added, “Pakistan’s deep state is desperate to take some major action in the hinterland. Looks like Pakistan and ISI are planning something big in India.”Warning Islamabad, Vaid remarked, “They should remember that Operation Sindoor is on, and if they undertake something, they will have to bear consequences for the complete annihilation of Pakistan.”Defence expert Captain Anil Gaur (Retd.), also speaking to ANI, urged the government to adopt a “strong stand” against Pakistan. He said, “On October 27, Hezbollah Mujahideen Jaish-e-Mohammad posters were found in Srinagar. It was found that one Dr Adil Ahmed was the person who had put up those posters... His interrogation led to Dr Muzammil, who was in Faridabad in a rented accommodation. His house was raided. A huge cache of arms and 360 kg of ammonium nitrate was recovered. ”Gaur also warned that terrorism was no longer limited to the uneducated. “Whatever the politicians may say, because of no jobs, no work avenues, persecuted people are becoming terrorists, but these are educated people,” he said, adding that recent arrests in Gujarat also involved a doctor allegedly creating ricin, a deadly poison.He asserted, “India has to now take a very strong stand, as our Prime Minister had already said, that Operation Sindoor is ongoing... If anything happens, there will be repercussions.”Union Minister Giriraj Singh, in a comment to ANI, stirred controversy by linking the case to communal angles. “The Modi government and the State government caught it. However, this was even dangerous than the Mumbai blasts... But, whenever they are caught, it is always a person from one community... a Muslim doctor has been arrested,” Singh said.He criticised Opposition leaders for not reacting. “Be it Rahul Gandhi, Lalu Prasad Yadav, Akhilesh Yadav or Asaduddin Owaisi, they would not issue a statement on this.

Univ stir turns into assertion of identity, administrative claim

CHANDIGARH: The Panjab University Senate issue, believed to have been resolved after the Centre's quick U-turn on its plans to restructure the body, erupted on Monday in a campus turmoil not seen in decades.What was a students' call for a campus shutdown to demand quick senate elections turned into an overwhelming show of strength by thousands of protesters of all hues - farmer organisations, Panthic outfits, social groups and the All-India Sikh Students Federation .They smashed police barricades and two locked gates, clashed with Chandigarh Police and stormed into the campus in organised groups.By afternoon, over 5,000 people were in the university - including a young Nihang atop a horse holding up a sword as he rode past the VC's office. The student demonstration had transformed into a politically driven incursion.This stopped being about the senate today. It became a political mobilisation by external elements. Panjab University should not be used as a platform for such political agendas. This institution cannot be turned into a theatre for power contests from outside. I urge all groups to respect the academic character of this university,"" VC Renu Vig said.PU had declared Monday and Tuesday holidays in view of the shutdown call. PU authorities have already submitted the senate poll schedule to vice-president C P Radhakrishnan, who is chancellor of the university, for approval, but it did nothing to stop the protests.The face-off started around midnight when groups of protesters from outside gathered along with students before the locked gates and raised slogans. A tense face-off with police ensued, and Chandigarh SSP Kanwardeep Kaur intervened to ease tensions.Before daybreak, Chandigarh police started setting up barricades at the entry points to screen vehicles coming from Punjab. But groups of protesters did get through and began massing in front of PU gates where 2,000 cops stood guard.Slogans for PU's autonomy were replaced with ""Panjab University Punjab Di"" and ""Chandigarh Punjab Da (PU and Chandigarh belong to Punjab)"". And speeches increasingly referenced the university's historic link to Punjab and the political debate around Chandigarh's control.The senate-centric protest turned into an assertion of identity and administrative claim. By university estimates, not more than 500 of those inside were PU students.SSP Kanwardeep Kaur was present when police resorted to a brief lathicharge and detained several people.Former Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi, Congress MLA Pargat Singh, Anandpur Sahib AAP MP Malvinder Singh Kang, AAP MLA Sukhanand and NSUI Punjab chief Isherpreet Sidhu also joined in the protest.","Thousands of protesters of all hues stormed into the campus in organised groups.

Ben Shapiro accuses Candace Owens of serious claims about Erika Kirk





New leaked text messages between Charlie Kirk and Candace Owens have shocked many online. The screenshots, posted by AF Post on X, show that before his death, Kirk believed Ben Shapiro was trying to “kill” both his and Owens’ careers as they got more famous. In the messages, Candace Owens sent Charlie Kirk an article titled “LEAK: Ben Shapiro’s YAF Launches Smear Campaign Against Charlie Kirk and Candace Owens – DANGEROUS.”Charlie Kirk replied with a laugh, then said Owens had become “bigger than Ben,” and that Shapiro wanted her to “punch down to him.” In another text, Kirk told Owens, “He views you as my slave. 100%. ‘Control her’ is what he was really saying when he called.” The texts do not show any date or time, so it’s unclear when the conversation took place. The messages were shared by AF Post, but their authenticity hasn’t been confirmed by any official source.While these leaked texts spread online, Ben Shapiro spoke about Candace Owens on The Megyn Kelly Show. During his talk, Shapiro said Owens had done “vile” things and that Kelly should have called her out. He then said, “If this were on the Left, and somebody was accusing Charlie Kirk’s wife of having murdered him, I assume you’d be talking about it.”When Kelly asked if Candace Owens had really accused Erika Kirk, Charlie Kirk’s widow, of killing her husband, Ben Shapiro replied, “She’s accusing TPUSA insiders and other members of the right wing, including Seth Dillon, of being involved in the murder of Charlie Kirk.”Owens quickly reacted on X, posting Ben Shapiro’s clip and calling him a liar. She wrote that he was “lying through his teeth” and called him “completely deranged.” Candace Owens said Ben Shapiro was trying to pressure Kelly into speaking badly about her using false claims.After Ben Shapiro’s comments, Erika Kirk appeared on Fox News with Jesse Watters and spoke about the related rumors swirling around. She said people should “pray and think” before posting things online about her late husband because it could hurt their kids in the future.Also Read: YouTuber Candace Owens Fires Back At Ben Shapiro After He Claims She Accused Erika Kirk Of Killing Charlie Kirk Charlie Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA, was shot dead on September 10, 2025.

Donald Trump has warned the BBC that it must retract and apologise for what the US president calls “false, defamatory, disparaging, and inflammatory statements” in a Panorama documentary about his Jan 6 speech, or face a 1$ billion lawsuit.His legal team has given the broadcaster until Friday to respond, according to Fox News. The corporation is already shaken by two senior resignations. BBC director general Tim Davie and BBC News chief Deborah Turness both stepped down as the row grew.The dispute centres on the Panorama film “Trump: A Second Chance”, which aired on October 28, 2024, shortly before the US presidential election. The programme showed a shortened and edited portion of Trump’s speech to supporters before the Capitol attack, and critics argue that it misrepresented what he said on the day. The White House called the BBC’s edit “misleading.""Trump’s litigation counsel sent a formal notice on Sunday to BBC chair Samir Shah and general counsel Sarah Jones. The letter, obtained by Fox News , claims the documentary “fabricated” statements and presented them to viewers without context.The letter says the documentary mixed together separate lines to show Trump telling supporters to “fight” but ignored the full passage and removed his call to protest peacefully.It also says the content went viral and reached tens of millions of people. Trump is demanding a full retraction, a public apology and compensation. The letter also instructs the BBC not to delete documents or data related to the programme.The notice warns that if the BBC does not comply by November 14 at 5pm EST, Trump will file legal action seeking “no less than 1,000,000,000 dollars in damages”.A BBC spokesperson said, “We will review the letter and respond directly in due course.”Trump reacted to the resignations of Time Davie and Deborah Turness on Truth Social, posting, “The TOP people in the BBC, including TIM DAVIE, the BOSS, are all quitting FIRED, because they were caught ‘doctoring’ my very good (PERFECT!) speech of January 6th.” He thanked The Telegraph for exposing what he called “Corrupt ‘Journalists’” and claimed the edit was an attempt to “step on the scales of a Presidential Election”.A spokesman for Trump’s legal team told Fox News Digital, “The BBC defamed President Trump by intentionally and deceitfully editing its documentary in order to try and interfere in the Presidential Election.” Trump’s press secretary Karoline Leavitt also said the BBC is “100% fake news” and “a propaganda machine”.","Donald Trump has warned the BBC that it must retract and apologise for what the US president calls “false, defamatory, disparaging, and inflammatory statements’ The dispute centres on the Panorama film “Trump: A Second Chance”, which aired on October 28, 2024, shortly before the US presidential election.

Canada loses measles-free status in major 'embarrassment'. Is US next?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/canada-loses-measles-free-status-in-major-embarrassment-is-us-next/articleshow/125234020.cms,"Canada is no more a measles-free country in a major public health failure.

What does it mean to Canadians?



Is US the next?







In a major embarrassment, Canada has lost its measles-free status, a year after measles started spreading. Canada has logged 5,138 measles cases this year and two deaths. Both were babies who were exposed to the measles virus in the womb and born prematurely. In 1998, Canada attained the measles-free status followed by the United States two years later. After hugely successful vaccination campaigns, the Americas became the first region in the world to be free of measles in 2016.Experts from the Pan American Health Organization, an independent health agency, made the determination on Canada's status after analyzing data on Canada’s outbreaks that showed the virus has spread continuously for a year.“While transmission has slowed recently, the outbreak has persisted over 12 months, primarily within under-vaccinated communities,” the Public Health Agency of Canada said in a statement Monday. “Canada can re-establish its measles elimination status once transmission of the measles strain associated with the current outbreak is interrupted for at least 12 months,” it added.McMaster University immunologist Dawn Bowdish told the National Post that it does not change anything for Canadians but it is a national embarrassment.""It doesn’t change the average Canadian’s day-to-day life, what it does mean is that one of the most debilitating and deadly childhood infections is present in our lives again,” Bowdish said. “It should be a national embarrassment to join a list of countries whose public health systems have been torn apart by war or civil unrest, but the more immediate tragedy is that we will see more lost pregnancies, more premature babies and more children who won’t ever grow to their full potential due to the terrible and short and long-term effects of measles. ”The US won the status in 2000, but is at risk as a large outbreak killed three and sickened nearly 900 across Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma is over. Current outbreaks in the US include 34 cases in South Carolina and one hitting towns on the Arizona-Utah border that has sickened more than 150 since mid-August.","Canada has logged 5,138 measles cases this year and two deaths.

The US Supreme Court has refused to take up a high-profile case seeking to overturn the nationwide right to same-sex marriage, leaving the landmark 2015 ruling in place.In its brief order on Monday, the court offered no explanation for why it declined to hear the appeal filed by Kim Davis, the former Kentucky county clerk who became a national figure after she refused to issue marriage licences to same-sex couples. Davis had asked the court to revisit and overturn the decision that legalised gay marriage across the United States.Her refusal nearly a decade ago led to a lengthy legal battle. She was ordered to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to a gay couple she had denied a licence. Her appeal raised fears among LGBTQ groups that the Supreme Court, which has a 6 to 3 conservative majority, might be open to revisiting the issue after striking down the constitutional right to abortion three years ago.Taking up the case would have required at least four justices to vote in favour, but the court opted not to move forward.The Human Rights Campaign, one of the largest LGBTQ advocacy organisations in the country, welcomed the decision. Its president, Kelley Robinson, said, ""Today, love won again."" Robinson added, ""When public officials take an oath to serve their communities, that promise extends to everyone including LGBTQ+ people.""She also said, ""The Supreme Court made clear today that refusing to respect the constitutional rights of others does not come without consequences. ""The 2015 ruling refers to Obergefell v. Hodges, the landmark Supreme Court decision that made same-sex marriage legal across the United States. The court held that the Constitution guarantees same-sex couples the fundamental right to marry, requiring all states to issue marriage licences and recognise marriages performed elsewhere. The ruling was seen as a major civil rights victory and ended decades of legal battles over marriage equality. It also meant that states could no longer enforce bans on same-sex unions. The decision reshaped family law nationwide and provided equal legal recognition, protections and benefits for same-sex couples under federal and state laws.","The US Supreme Court has refused to take up a high-profile case seeking to overturn the nationwide right to same-sex marriage.

MI5 chief's request to Patel

Amid continuous glare on his professional and personal life, FBI director Kash Patel has now been accused of being unpredictable, unreliable, and unprofessional while dealing with other intelligence allies like MI5, the New York Times reported, citing several incidents. Patel has recently been in the news for his overuse of FBI jet for personal visits that involved his girlfriend Alexis Wilkins, who faces vicious trolling as people call her an 'Israeli spy' who 'honeytrapped' Kash.Kash Patel visited London along with Alexis for work, the report said, detailing several awkward points that took place there. It was a secret event codenamed 'Gold Sycamore"" held in the Sussex countryside. All dignitaries were scheduled to land at Stansted Airport outside London, but Patel wanted to fly to an airport closer to hotel. The request was denied.Patel wanted his security detail to be armed but the UK Police, because of its strict gun-control laws, did not allow Patel's security to be armed.The NYT report cited a former US official to report that the Patel surprised many attendees of a meeting in London where he arrived wearing a trucker hat and a green hooded sweatshirt which was not unexpected of him, as he often breaks FBI tradition by not wearing a suit.MI5 chief Ken McCallum reportedly asked Patel to keep the job of an FBI agent based in London with a tech-based role as MI5 needs FBI's help for high-tech surveillance tools. Patel told McCallum that he would not axe the post but the post had already been axed by that time. It is not clear whether Patel did ot know it because the report claimed that Patel was briefed specifically about it before he left for London.The report mentioned another frivolous move by Patel when he and Alexis joined the other security and intelligence officials for a dinner at Windsor Palace with King Charles III. Patel chose next to the king as the group gathered for a photograph.","FBI director Kash Patel accused of being unpredictable, unreliable, and unprofessional while dealing with other intelligence allies like MI5.

On November 9, 2025, Alex posted a long message on X saying that Candace’s words made it sound like people close to Charlie were behind his death.Alex Clark said Candace “stopped just short of outright accusing them of orchestrating his death.” Clark said this after giving an interview to The Wall Street Journal, where Candace Owens said her tone was “icky.” Alex said Candace wrongly claimed she was not sad about Charlie Kirk’s death and accused TPUSA of “using his death to push their mission.”Alex Clark said Candace Owens has made many strange claims about Charlie Kirk’s death. Candace told CNN reporter Elle Reeve that she does not believe Tyler Robinson, the man police accused, killed Charlie Kirk.Candace Owens said, “I personally don’t believe that Tyler Robinson killed Charles Curtis.” She claimed she has “sources on both sides” who said there were “weird Fed messages” with no timestamps. Candace said this proves something is not right in the case.Elle Reeve then asked if Candace had any real proof. Candace Owens replied, “Discord came out and said the messages didn’t exist.”Reeve corrected her, saying the messages were text messages, not from Discord. Candace Owens admitted she had not read that part and said she had “leaks” as her source.Alex Clark then wrote that Candace was attacking people Charlie loved and trusted. “That was the start of Candace’s tirade against the very people Charlie called his closest friends and mentors. She’s stopped just short of outright accusing them of orchestrating his death.”Alex Clark also pointed out that Candace said she felt “icky” about the timing and tone of Alex’s Wall Street Journal interview but did not say the same about her own CNN interview. Alex said this showed double standards.Candace Owens has also spread wild theories about how Charlie was killed. In one of them, she said the killer may have used an underground tunnel to escape after shooting him.Also Read: Charlie Kirk's Leaked Messages Show Ben Shapiro’s Jealousy Toward YouTuber Candace Owens As Feud Explodes Online Right now, there is no proof of any of Candace’s claims.

NEW DELHI: CCTV images have emerged showing the white Hyundai i20 that exploded near the Red Fort on Monday evening, killing nine people and injuring at least 20 others.The vehicle bearing registration number HR 26CE 7674 was parked in a nearby parking lot for over two hours before the blast.Investigators suspect that a man identified as Umar, absconding in a related explosives case in Faridabad, was driving the vehicle.A CCTV grab shows the car entering the parking lot with the driver’s hand resting on the window, while another image shows him wearing a blue-and-black T-shirt.The explosion occurred around 6.52 pm at the Subhash Marg traffic signal, near the Red Fort Metro Station, during peak rush hour. The blast, which originated in the Hyundai i20, triggered a chain reaction that set several other vehicles on fire and caused panic across the congested Old Delhi stretch.Initial reports suggest that five to six cars, four motorcycles and three e-rickshaws caught fire after the explosion. Videos from the scene showed flames engulfing vehicles, with bodies and debris scattered across the carriageway. Locals described the sound as so powerful that windows shattered in homes near Sis Ganj Gurdwara, nearly 500 metres away.Eyewitnesses said the area was packed with evening commuters. “The casualties were high because the road has bumper-to-bumper traffic at that hour,” a police officer said, adding that the spot — between Delhi Gate and Kashmere Gate, close to Jama Masjid and Old Delhi railway station — is one of the city’s busiest stretches.Delhi Police, along with the Special Cell, NIA, and Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL), reached the site within minutes. Union home minister Amit Shah said teams from the Crime Branch and Special Branch arrived within 10 minutes of the blast.“I have spoken to the Delhi CP and Special Branch in charge. We are exploring all possibilities and will conduct a thorough investigation,” Shah said.Police Commissioner Satish Golcha confirmed that the blast occurred when the slow-moving car stopped at the signal. “Nearby vehicles were damaged. Some people have died and others injured. All agencies are present at the site,” he said.A case has been registered under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, the Explosives Act, and relevant sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita at Kotwali Police Station.Investigators are examining over 100 CCTV clips, including footage from nearby toll plazas, to trace the car’s movement toward Daryaganj. The vehicle was reportedly registered to a Gurgaon resident named Salman, but later sold to a person identified as Tariq from Pulwama.Officials are also probing whether the blast is linked to a foiled terror conspiracy in Faridabad earlier the same day, where a cache of explosives was seized.Fire officials said they received the first SOS call at 6.55 pm, following which seven fire tenders were rushed to the scene. Massive flames and thick smoke were brought under control after a two-hour operation.If confirmed as a terror-related attack, this would be Delhi’s first major blast since the 2011 high court bombing.","CCTV images have emerged showing the Hyundai i20 that exploded near the Red Fort on Monday evening, killing nine people and injuring at least 20 others.

BHOPAL: Sunrays don’t quite reach here, but BLOs braving rivers, cliffs, and forest trails have made their way into Patalkot — the 12km deep, horseshoe-shaped valley in Satpura range, in Madhya Pradesh’s Chhindwara. Nestled in a gorge and shielded from direct sunlight by a cliff overhang, this mystical land is also a treasure trove of medicinal plants – known for its tribal culture and dense forests.Spread across four polling booths — Palanigailadubva, Ghatalinga, Jadmadal Harrakachhar, and Kaream Rated — nearly 3,000 Bharia tribal voters live in villages where mobile signals fade and roads vanish. A staircase made many years ago has also eroded with time. There is a thin strip of road constructed under Prime Minister’s Grameen Sadak Yojana, but it’s quite steep and prone to skidding.The BLOs used bikes, trekked, and even crossed water streams to reach the villages.With most villagers unfamiliar with forms, BLOs are filling them up by hand, matching names from old records downloaded at rare network spots.“I am from Patalkot myself. There are around 632 voters in our area, but since I live above the valley, I have to climb down the steep road to reach the villages.At some places, there are roads, but in others, I have to walk for miles. Despite the odds, I have already distributed around 80% of the enumeration forms,” said Dinesh Bharti, BLO at Kaream Rated booth in Patalkot.“Most tribal people don’t even know how to fill up the forms. I have told them if they can, they may fill them themselves — otherwise, I will help when I return to collect them,” Bharti added.“There’s network access only at a few spots. I sit there and download the 2003 voters’ list to find the details of voters. I note them down in a notebook and then trek to the remote villages. There are three villages under my polling booth — Kaream Rated, Chimtipur, and Ghoghri Gujja Dongri. There’s no road to Gujja Dongri; I have to walk about 3 km and cross a river to reach it,” he said.Instead of struggling to find a spot with network access to download the list, another BLO, Ganesh Prasad Dhurvey, posted at Jadmadal Harrakachhar booth, said, “I downloaded the entire 2003 voters’ list of my booth and got it printed. This has made my work much easier.”“There are 894 voters under my booth, and so far, I have distributed more than 50% of the enumeration forms. It’s tough — I live above the valley and have to climb down steep slopes, walking through stretches with no road,” Dhurvey explained.Besides these two, there are 640 voters at the Ghatalinga polling booth and 800 at Palanigailadubva. Altogether, the four polling booths of Patalkot have around 2,966 voters, all falling under the Amarwara assembly constituency of Chhindwara district.Under the special intensive revision (SIR) of the voters list, the door-to-door enumeration of voters by BLOs began in the state on November 4 and will continue on December 4, after which the draft electoral rolls will be published on December 9. These surveys and distribution of enumeration forms are going on in Patalkot too.","Patalkot is a 12km deep, horseshoe-shaped valley in Satpura range, in Madhya Pradesh’s Chhindwara.Spread across four polling booths — Palanigailadubva, Ghatalinga, Jadmadal Harrakachhar, and Kaream Rated — nearly 3,000 Bharia tribal voters live in villages.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125239564,imgsize-32360,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/nearly-3000-bharia-tribal-voters-live-in-villages-in-patalkot.jpg"

NEW DELHI: At least nine people were killed and 30 others injured in a high-intensity car explosion near the Red Fort in Old Delhi on Monday evening, leaving the area in chaos. The sheer force of the blast was so powerful that human body parts, along with fragments of vehicles, were scattered across a radius of 20–25 metres, turning the bustling street into a scene of horror.Eyewitnesses described a surreal and horrifying scene as massive flames engulfed the road, thick smoke blanketed the area, and debris from the explosion was thrown violently across nearby vehicles. “We thought the world was ending. People were screaming, and bodies were lying everywhere,” one passerby said.Jai (49), a watch shop owner travelling from Lala Lajpat Rai Market towards Kashmere Gate, had a close shave as he was just 10 metres from the spot. “I parked my scooty some distance away due to the rush and took an e-rickshaw with two others. Within a minute, I heard a noise so loud my ears got blocked. Then I saw car parts flying and scattered body parts,” Jai said.Maujib (24), who was at a nearby traffic signal, recalled the panic: “There was a huge crowd, and the moment we heard a loud noise, everyone just scrambled and ran for their lives.”The explosion originated from a slow-moving Hyundai i20 hatchback, registered in Gurgaon, which had stopped at a traffic signal around 6:52 pm.The force of the blast also set five to six nearby cars, four motorcycles, and three e-rickshaws on fire, adding to the devastation.Residents in the vicinity reported shattered windows and widespread panic, as the shockwave was felt within a 500-metre radius. Many rushed out of their homes to help, while others attempted to rescue victims trapped in the flames. The dense traffic along this stretch, connecting Delhi Gate, Chandni Chowk, and Kashmere Gate, contributed to the high casualties.Police confirmed that apart from the occupants of the car, passersby were among the victims. Early investigations suggest that the car might have contained a CNG kit, though experts and videos from the scene indicate that the scale of destruction far exceeded what a standard CNG mishap could cause.Authorities are investigating a possible terror angle, with forensic reports awaited. If confirmed, this would mark the first terror-related blast in Delhi in 14 years, the last being in 2011 at the high court. Home Minister Amit Shah has been briefed on the situation, and multiple agencies, including the NSG, NIA, and Delhi Police Special Cell, have been deployed to secure the area and probe the incident.“This was not just an explosion; it was a violent force that tore through the crowd and vehicles, leaving devastation in every direction,” a senior police official said.The Red Fort blast has left Delhi shaken, with horrifying images of scattered body parts and vehicle debris serving as a grim reminder of the blast’s sheer power.","At least nine people were killed and 30 others injured in a high-intensity car explosion near the Red Fort in Old Delhi on Monday evening.

Several X users said the optics were “detached from reality.” One wrote: “Travelling by private jet to a conference about climate change is a level of detachment from reality that’s impossible to grasp.” Others slammed the climate conference COP30 itself, pointing out the number of VIP flights heading to Brazil: “Hundreds of private jets from around the world are descending on Belém to talk about climate change and ways to restrict your free movement. If this makes sense to you, you’re part of the problem.” Another user wrote: “Private jet to come lecture on carbon emissions.

Sergio Gor Calls Meeting With PM Modi 'Incredible', Says ‘Trump Considers Him Great Friend’





US president Donald Trump will be swearing in ambassador-designate to New Delhi Sergio Gor in the Oval Office on Monday amid growing disquiet among foreign policy boffins about his erratic policies they say have damaged ties with a range of allies including India.The White House schedule lists Gor’s swearing in for 3 pm EST (1.30 am IST) after Trump hosts Syrian president Ahmed al‑Sharaa, a former al Qaeda leader formally listed as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist till recently, signaling a major US policy shift in the region.Removed from the terrorism watchlist, Sharaa arrived in Washington DC over the weekend and was spotted playing basketball with security personnel even as other US allies are jumping through hoops to appease the US president’s fixation with tariffs and trade imbalances, among other piques.Presidential involvement in ambassador swear-ins is rare and exceptional, not the norm. The standard practice is for the vice president to administer the oath of office to newly confirmed ambassadors, typically at the vice president's ceremonial office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building or occasionally at the State Department.But Trump administering oath of office to Gor is seen as more as a reflection of the envoy’s closeness to the president than the importance he attaches to India, a country he has repeatedly twitted and taunted in recent times with both his policies, notably on tariffs, and his enthusiastic outreach to Pakistan and China, and his abrasive remarks.Gor has already visited New Delhi on a recce as ambassador-designate and will head back to try and steady, if not salvage what many experts say is a trainwreck caused by Trump’s haphazard policies that often talks up his personal ties with Prime Minister Modi while inflicting serious damage to ties with India with punitive measures. Trade and foreign policy analysts like Raymond Vickery and David Price have excoriated the president for a transactional approach they say has eroded trust, harming ties that took more than half a century to rebuild after the 1970s fiasco.“Pakistan has a tariff of 19% and India has a 50% tariff. Where is the friendship between Modi and Trump that was extolled? It is a slap in the face for Modi because the Indian opposition is asking him where’s the friendship,” former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan said at a Chicago thinktank event last week. While the two countries could arrive at a trade agreement soon, Rajan warned that the US risked losing India’s trust because “these things stay long in people’s mind,"" despite all the talk of military alignment between the two countries. The partnership was most recently reiterated in talks between the defence establishments of the two countries and the signing of a ten-year defense framework agreement by defence minister Rajnath Singh and US defense secretary Pete Hegseth.However, Trump’s repeated reference to a G-2 formulation with regards to China, a country US analysts say he has virtually surrendered to on the trade issue, and his disdain for the G-20, whose annual meeting in South Africa later this month he is avoiding, has alarmed foreign policy experts who say his moves make no sense. The US president also appears to have put the Quad, a grouping of US, India, Japan, and Australia, on the backburner, abandoning a leadership summit India was to have hosted in November.In a commentary headlined Trump’s incoherent foreign policy defies explanation, Max Boot, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relation, said the US president’s pronouncements are so often unexpected and disconnected from reality that they leave foreign policy scholars, and foreign leaders, bewildered. He pointed to Trump’s recent outbursts against South Africa, Venezuela, and Nigeria among other countries to maintain that his decisions are based on a whim, often driven by disinformation, and the purpose could simply be “to keep the world off balance and to keep the spotlight on him. ”",US president Donald Trump will be swearing in ambassador-designate to New Delhi Sergio Gor in the Oval Office on Monday.

“F*** the Jews”

Dave Portnoy’s shocking encounter sparks outrage and police response

“I experience antisemitism daily. It’s gotten to a point where people think it’s okay.”

On Monday, November 10, 2025, police in Starkville, Mississippi, arrested 20-year-old Patrick McClintock after a shocking video of him heckling Dave Portnoy went viral online. In the clip, the man could be heard yellingand throwing coins toward Portnoy outside a local pizza shop. The Barstool Sports founder was in town filming one of his “One Bite” pizza review videos when the disturbing incident happened, drawing widespread outrage across social media platforms within hours of posting.According to Brandon Lovelady, the Public Information Officer for the Starkville Police Department, McClintock has been charged with disturbing the peace. The department said they were made aware of the viral video on Friday, November 8, and quickly issued a warrant before arresting him on Monday. McClintock was processed, photographed for a mugshot, and later released after posting bail.Just a day before the Mississippi State vs. the University of Georgia football game, where Dave Portnoy and his Barstool Sports crew were filming local food restaurants, the argument took place.During the shooting, McClintock approached and started screaming anti-Semitic slurs, therefore interrupting the recording.Portnoy seems startled in the viral video, but he remains composed as the man leaves; spectators look quite uneasy. Speaking to TMZ, Officer Lovelady said, “Every person has the right to feel safe and respected in our community.Offensive words alone are protected, but when behavior risks violence, we act to maintain public safety.” He added that the case could face enhanced penalties if it’s found to be bias-motivated under Mississippi law.After the arrest, Dave Portnoy reacted online, saying such hateful acts are not new to him. Just a day earlier, on CBS Sunday Morning, he said,First published on X, formerly Twitter, the video rapidly went viral and was adopted by many sports and entertainment outlets.Also Read: IShowSpeed Leaves Viewers Stunned After DNA Results Uncover Shocking Truth About His Real Heritage And Identity Media celebrities, writers, and followers condemned the action and advocated for more severe measures against hate speech.The Starkville Police Department said today that the probe is still underway and that they are assessing if McClintock's actions meet the conditions for a hate crime allegation under state statute.","Police in Starkville, Mississippi, arrested 20-year-old Patrick McClintock after a shocking video of him heckling Dave Portnoy went viral online.

Amid the ongoing Christian-Hinduism controversy, Nalin Haley , the son of former US ambassador to UN Nikki Haley, has spoken about his unique journey in finding his faith in a multi-faith family. In an interview with UnHerd, the 24-year-old Indian-origin MAGA voice said he was confused over religion in his childhood. His maternal grandparents who were almost his surrogate parents, followed Sikhism while his parents were Protestant Christians.Haley said he immersed himself in books on world religions to find out what he should follow when other kids of his age were reading about cars and dinosaurs. Eventually, he concluded that Christianity is the true faith but the conclusion was preceded by a spiritual experience that he did not detail in the interview.“I needed to research my own faith better in terms of the history, the early beliefs, the Church Fathers,” he said. “When I did that, I felt as though anyone who does that kind of research will walk away a Catholic.”The interview comes as Hindu Indian-origin politicians in the US are facing unprecedented attacks over their religion. Vice President JD Vance recently said he would like to see his wife Usha Vance converted to Christianity.Though JD clarified that Usha Vance has no intention of converting, the episode showed how MAGA is Christian nationalists at core and unapologetic about it.Haley said he chose his political path too in a similar fashion. I was not just going to have the same political views as my parents,” he said adding that he supported Nikki Haley in the 2024 Republican primary only to be a ""good son"". “I didn’t and was never going to be an advocate for a view that I did not have,"" he said.

US shutdown: Senate passes bipartisan funding deal to end 41-day government deadlock; bill heads to House — what's next?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-shutdown-senate-passes-bipartisan-funding-deal-to-end-41-day-government-deadlock-bill-heads-to-house/articleshow/125238963.cms,"US Shutdown ‘Ends’ After 40 Days; Senate Passes Bill After Dems ‘COMPROMISE’ With House GOP | WATCH

Democrats backs GOP for reopening government

Schumer again on hot seat



What's next?





The Senate ended its stalemate and approved a bipartisan funding package late Monday night, marking the end of the 41st day of the government shutdown and sending the legislation to the House of Representatives.A group of eight Senate Democratic caucus members joined Republicans to combine an updated continuing resolution (CR) with three spending bills into a minibus package. Their votes cleared procedural hurdles and handed the onus of reopening the govt to the House, Reuters reported.Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., had pressed since the shutdown began for lawmakers to vote on a short-term funding measure, coupled with a promise to address expiring Obamacare subsidies. He reiterated that pledge, saying the subsidy legislation would receive a vote “No later than the second week of December.”The Senate advanced the measure despite concerns that objections and other procedural manoeuvres might derail the process. The final vote came deep into Monday night, after the package passed its first procedural test earlier in the day.“I think everybody’s pretty united [behind] this bill,” Sen.Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, said. “We want to reopen the government.”Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and his caucus had insisted throughout the shutdown that they would only vote to reopen the government if they secured an ironclad deal on expiring Obamacare subsidies. That deal did not materialise. Instead, eight Senate Democrats accepted Thune’s guarantee to hold a future vote on the subsidies.Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., one of the eight who crossed the aisle, said: “This was the only deal on the table. It was our best chance to reopen the government and immediately begin negotiations to extend the [Obamacare] tax credits that tens of millions of Americans rely on to keep costs down.”Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., another of the eight, said that Republicans were not going to budge on healthcare until after the govt reopened, but that promises of protections for federal employees during future shutdowns and back pay for those furloughed persuaded him to support the package.The deal has provoked anger among many Democrats who note there is no guarantee that the Republican-controlled Senate or House would agree to extend the health insurance subsidies. And they blamed Schumer for this.While criticism from the left was scathing, only the 45 Democratic senators and two independents who caucus with them could remove Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer from his leadership role or defeat him in a leadership election that would be held following the November 2026 elections. Schumer was not up for re-election to another six-year Senate term until 2028.Progressives took a much harsher tone. The advocacy group Our Revolution urged Schumer to resign as minority leader, as did Representative Ro Khanna of California, who said in a statement, ""Senator Schumer is no longer effective and should be replaced.""California Governor Gavin Newsom, seen as a contender for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination, on social media called the compromise ""Pathetic. This isn't a deal. It's surrender.""It next heads to the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, where Speaker Mike Johnson has said he would like to pass it as soon as Wednesday and send it on to Trump to sign into law.Trump has called the deal to reopen the government ""very good.""Johnson later told House Republicans on a lawmakers-only call that he anticipated a vote in their chamber by midweek. “We’re going to plan on voting, on being here, at least by Wednesday,” he said. He added that while the schedule could shift later in the week, “right now we think we’re on track for a vote on Wednesday. So we need you here.”Johnson also signalled that the House would not move to fast-track the package via suspension of the rules, which would raise the passage threshold to two-thirds of the chamber. He said the House Rules Committee should be ready to move by Tuesday at the earliest.",Eight Senate Democratic caucus members joined Republicans to combine an updated continuing resolution (CR) with three spending bills into a minibus package.

British Muslim Journalist Sami Hamdi set to be released after ICE detention; wife demands justice,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/british-muslim-journalist-sami-hamdi-set-to-be-released-after-ice-detention-wife-demands-justice/articleshow/125237919.cms,"



British Muslim journalist Sami Hamdi, who was arrested by US federal immigration authorities, is set to be released and allowed to return to the UK after being held for more than two weeks.On Monday, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) said he had opted to accept a US govt offer to leave the country voluntarily, CNN reported.Hamdi, a London-based commentator visiting the United States on a speaking tour, was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on October 26 as he passed through San Francisco International Airport. Authorities informed him that he was being held for overstaying his US visa.Muslim advocacy groups contend that his visa was revoked without cause or prior notice during his trip. Hamdi’s family believe the decision was driven by his public criticism of Israel’s actions in the Palestinian territories.“The government has agreed to release Sami,” Hamdi’s family said in a statement posted on social media Monday. “He will be able to return home soon insha’Allah.”Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told CNN that Hamdi had voluntarily requested removal from the US and that ICE was “happily arranging his removal from this country.”McLaughlin characterised Hamdi as “an illegal alien and terrorist sympathizer” and said “Under President Trump, those who support terrorism and undermine American national security will not be allowed to work or visit this country. ”ICE records show Hamdi remained in custody in California Monday afternoon. He was detained a day after speaking at CAIR’s annual gala in California.CAIR’s California chapter and Hamdi’s lawyer welcomed the US decision to release the British national. “This agreement establishes that the government does not consider Hamdi a danger to the community or to national security,” the statement read.On Friday, Hamdi’s wife Soumaya said the US government provided “no evidence” to justify his detention. “If they want him out of the country, why not simply let him go?” she posted to Instagram. “Why is the US government holding a British journalist without charge?”Hamdi is known for his analysis of Middle East developments and appearances on British television. He recently spoke about the US-brokered ceasefire deal in Gaza and international plans for the enclave’s post-war governance. At an event in London in 2023 following Hamas’ October 7 attack, he called on the audience to “celebrate the victory.” In a speech the following year hosted by the Canadian Muslim Public Affairs Council, he said that “no one is saying October 7 was right” and that “People are saying October 7 was a natural consequence of the oppression that is being put on the Palestinians. ”“It is this simple: Sami never should have spent a single night in an ICE cell,” CAIR-CA CEO Hussam Ayloush said on Monday. “His only real ‘offense’ was speaking clearly about Israel’s genocidal war crimes against Palestinians.”Hamdi is among the latest pro-Palestinian foreign nationals whose visas were revoked by the Trump administration. Earlier this year, Cornell graduate student Momodou Taal had his visa revoked and was targeted for deportation. The dual UK-Gambian citizen accused the Trump administration of targeting him for participating in pro-Palestinian protests amid the Israel-Hamas war. In late March, Taal announced he would voluntarily leave the US.","British journalist Sami Hamdi is set to be released and allowed to return to the UK after being held for more than two weeks.

US President Donald Trump on Monday demanded US air-traffic controllers return to work and offered a $10,000 bonus to those who had stayed on the job without pay during the government shutdown.The shutdown, which began October 1 and was now the longest in history, had meant 13,000 controllers, 50,000 TSA agents, and more than a million other govt workers went without pay for over a month, prompting some to call in sick, take leave or otherwise not show up for work.“All Air Traffic Controllers must get back to work, NOW!!!
