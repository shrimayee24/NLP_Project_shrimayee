He asserted that the attackers had not just targeted unarmed tourists, but had challenged the very soul of India.During a high-level meeting with senior defence officials on April 29, PM Modi said that the armed forces have full operational freedom to choose how, when, and where to respond to the attack, news agency PTI reported quoting government sources.","Pakistani troops fired without provocation in eight forward areas along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir.

"India makes Chenab run dry, for now",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-bound-chenabs-flows-regulated-river-almost-dry/articleshow/120909547.cms,"A view of the Chenab River as the water level drops after the closure of Salal Dam, in Reasi on Monday. (Pic credit: ANI)

SRINAGAR/JAMMU:

Authorities have since Sunday restricted flows through Jammu’s Baglihar and Salal hydroelectric dams on the Chenab that runs on to Pakistan, causing such an unprecedented drop in water levels that residents in downstream areas were able to walk across the river for the first time in recent memory.The actions demonstrate India’s ability to regulate timing of water releases and comes after the Centre’s decision to suspend Indus Water Treaty (IWT) with Pakistan following the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 people, mostly tourists. Under IWT, India would have had to inform Pakistan before regulating Chenab’s waters.Sources said the authorities had closed all five main gates of Baglihar Dam and those of Salal Dam downstream. Water released from Baglihar typically flows to Salal before the Chenab rolls into Pakistan, where it serves as a critical lifeline for its Punjab province. By closing both dams, authorities effectively stopped the river’s flow.Officials downplayed the moves, saying the dams’ gates were first opened to flush out silt and mud and then closed under a “continuous process”.In Jammu’s Akhnoor, dozens walked across the river, something they said they had never experienced before. Children collected coins from the bed as water levels dropped to 1.5-2ft from 25-30ft. “For the first time in my life today, I was able to walk across half the Chenab. It’s unbelievable,” an Akhnoor resident said on Monday.Many welcomed PM Narendra Modi’s decision to put IWT on hold. “We do not want even a single drop of water to be supplied to Pakistan. We stand with Indian Army and PM Modi,” said Akhnoor’s Vinay Gupta. Fellow resident Kamal Langer echoed the sentiment: “Our govt is giving Pakistan a befitting reply in a lot of ways.”According to Luv Puri, former UN counter-terrorism official and a Kashmir expert, the implications of placing IWT in abeyance are becoming increasingly evident. “It shows this was preceded by significant preparation,” Puri said.IWT gives India exclusive rights to use waters of “Eastern Rivers” -- Sutlej, Beas and Ravi -- and their tributaries before they enter Pakistan, while the latter secured rights over the waters of the “Western Rivers” -- Chenab, Jhelum and Indus.“Earlier analyses suggesting India lacked the infrastructure to exert pressure through water management have proven inaccurate. The impact of suspending IWT reveals that India has, in fact, developed the infrastructure needed to leverage water strategically,” Puri said.Farooq Abdullah, former chief minister and president of J&K’s governing National Conference (NC), had on Saturday reiterated his party’s opposition to IWT. He argued that the 1960 treaty had harmed J&K’s interests and called for diverting Chenab’s waters to Jammu and harnessing Jhelum’s waters to generate power in Kashmir. NC has long claimed that the rights over the region’s rivers were given to Pakistan under IWT without consulting J&K. “We have been saying that this treaty has to be reviewed,” Abdullah said.",Authorities have since Sunday restricted flows through Jammu’s Baglihar and Salal hydroelectric dams on the Chenab that runs on to Pakistan.

Agreeing with PM Narendra Modi on the need for an “uncompromising” fight against terrorism , Russian President Vladimir Putin in a phone call with PM Narendra Modi stressed that the perpetrators of the Pahalgam terrorist attack and their supporters must be brought to justice.Putin, who had written to Modi on the day of the attack (April 22) expressing hope the perpetrators will get deserved punishment, strongly condemned the massacre in remarks seen as a strong endorsement of India’s position, at a time the Indian government is considering military options to defang the threat of cross-border terrorism from Pakistan.Putin’s remarks also came in the middle of calls by the West and India’s important Gulf partners for de-escalation and restraint. Russia’s own foreign minister Sergey Lavrov spoke to counterpart S Jaishankar last week and urged India to resolve “disagreements” diplomatically and politically, in line with the Simla Agreement that Pakistan has threatened to put in abeyance.There was no mention of restraint or use of diplomatic means in the Kremlin readout on this occasion as it said that Putin again expressed his sincere condolences over the death of Indian citizens because of the “barbaric terrorist attack” on April 22 in Pahalgam in southern Kashmir. “Both sides emphasized the need for an uncompromising fight against terrorism in all its manifestations,’’ it added.Expressing the same sentiment in its own version of the talks, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) quoted Putin as emphasising that the perpetrators of the heinous attack and their supporters must be brought to justice. “President Putin called PM Narendra Modi and strongly condemned the terror attack in Pahalgam, India. He conveyed deepest condolences on the loss of innocent lives and expressed full support to India in the fight against terrorism,’’ said spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.Putin’s call for action against the perpetrators and their backers echoed US President Donald Trump’s initial reaction to the attack in which he expressed full support for India’s efforts to bring the Pahalgam terrorists to justice. In the past week or so, there has been pressure on India from the US to work with Pakistan for de-escalation, as evident from the State Department’s readout of secretary of state Marco Rubio’s last conversation with Jaishankar.In the talks on Monday, Modi also reiterated the invite for Putin to visit India for the annual India-Russia summit and the latter accepted it “with gratitude”. According to Russian authorities, the strategic nature of Russia-India relations as a special privileged partnership was emphasized. “These relations are not subject to external influence and continue to develop dynamically in all areas,’’ said the Russian readout.Modi also congratulated Putin for the upcoming May 9 Victory Day celebrations. Russia had invited Modi for the event, but the government had nominated defence minister Rajnath Singh to represent India. However, Singh’s junior minister Sanjay Seth will now visit Moscow as Singh stays put here in the middle of rising tensions with Pakistan.",Russian President Vladimir Putin in a phone call with PM Narendra Modi stressed that the perpetrators of the Pahalgam terrorist attack and their supporters must be brought to justice.

BHUBANESWAR: An Odisha govt probe has dismissed allegations that surplus wood from Puri Jagannath temple had been used to craft idols at the newly consecrated Jagannath shrine in Bengal's Digha, with officials attributing the controversy to a servitor's 'slip of tongue' in a television interview.Servitor Ramakrushna Dasmohapatra, who attended the Digha temple's inauguration, had claimed during a TV interview in Kolkata that he used surplus wood from the 2015 Nabakalebara to craft the Digha shrine idols.""We got it investigated by the Shree Jagannath Temple Administration (SJTA) and found no truth in his claim. Dasmohapatra was summoned and asked by SJTA. Dasmohapatra admitted that it was a slip of tongue,"" law minister Prithiviraj Harichandan said.The minister confirmed that SJTA officials spoke to temple craftsmen, who verified that excess wood was not taken out of the Puri shrine for the construction of Digha temple idols.An investigation revealed that Dasmohapatra had commissioned a Bhubaneswar-based artisan for the Digha idols. The SJTA's questioning of the artisan confirmed that he had sourced neem wood from a timber supplier for the project.""Dasmohapatra's lies and wayward media statement hurt the sentiments of devotees. It is now officially clear that our temple's surplus wood was not taken outside for any other purpose. Dasmohapatra has been asked to submit a written explanation.

Will bring SOPs for Jagannath temples outside Puri: Odisha

BHUBANESWAR/KOLKATA: Odisha government threatened on Monday legal action against Bengal for naming a newly inaugurated Jagannath temple in Digha as ""Jagannath Dham"", escalating an already bitter row that now spans religious tradition, regional pride, and political rivalry.Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee hit back, accusing BJP-governed Odisha of ""jealousy"" and of targeting Bengalis, while social media campaigns flared with hashtags like #BoycottPuri and #BoycottOdisha.Odisha law minister Prithiviraj Harichandan declared that ""Dham"" can only be associated with four sacred places - Badrinath, Dwarka, Rameswaram, and Jagannath Puri - and said using it for Digha has ""created anguish among devotees everywhere"".""We will also ask Bengal to stop referring to the beach near the Digha temple as Mahodadhi, a term found in scriptures describing the beach at Puri,"" Harichandan said.Puri's titular king and Lord Jagannath's chief servitor Gajapati Dibyasingha Deb condemned the use of the term ""Jagannath Dham"" for the Digha shrine, which was inaugurated on April 30. He said the term is exclusive to Puri. Citing ancient scriptures and Muktimandapa Pandit Sabha, Deb urged Digha temple authorities to ""desist from calling it Jagannath Dham"".Odisha announced it would introduce SOPs for all Jagannath temples outside Puri, defining the roles of servitors after some participated in the Digha temple's consecration - a move seen by many in Odisha as a breach of sacred tradition.For her part, CM Banerjee lashed out at Odisha and other BJP-governed states, accusing them of hostility and discrimination. ""When Mamata Banerjee builds skywalks at Dakshineswar or Kalighat, nobody raises a question. When I celebrate Durga and Kali puja, there's no outrage. Then why this animosity over Jagannath Dham?"" she asked. ""Why is there so much jealousy?""Speaking in violence-hit Murshidabad, Banerjee accused Odisha of ""thrashing"" Bengali-speaking people and said Bengalis are being assaulted in several BJP-governed states, including Maharashtra, Bihar, and UP.""You are attacking our migrant workers for speaking Bengali but we will not do the same. That is the difference between you and me,"" she said. ""We have reached out to Odisha, Bihar, and Rajasthan. Our DGP has spoken to Odisha's DGP. Our chief secretary is writing to the Union home secretary. I hope good sense prevails.""TMC MP and former cricketer Yusuf Pathan claimed that 20,000 Bengali workers fled Odisha after recent assaults - a charge Odisha revenue minister Suresh Pujari dismissed, advising Pathan to ""stick to cricket commentary"". Odisha police reported no complaints of such attacks.Banerjee reminded Odisha of Bengal's support during natural disasters. ""You seek engineers from us during cyclones. Bengal sends the maximum number of tourists to Puri. So why the outrage if we build a Jagannath Dham in Digha?"" she asked.Odisha government earlier notified that people should not visit the Digha temple, a move Banerjee condemned.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A seven-year-old girl from Kunnikode in Kollam, succumbed to rabies at SAT Hospital in the city on Monday morning.She is the third child to have died of rabies infection despite receiving vaccination in Kerala in a month. Bhagyalakshmi, 13, from Pullad, Pathanamthitta, died on April 9, and Ziya Faris, 6, from Thenhipalam, Malappuram, died on April 29. Niya, who was bitten by a dog on April 8, received three doses of the anti-rabies vaccine and immunoglobulin serum.Soon after the dog bit her, Niya was taken to a primary health centre and later referred to Punalur taluk hospital after a medical examination found the wound to be deep. She was administered the anti-rabies vaccine and immunoglobulin serum at the taluk hospital. However, she was referred to SAT Hospital after she developed a fever on April 28 and diagnosed with rabies.Hospital authorities said a deep dog bite on the nerve-rich part of Niya's elbow and the anterior part of the elbow joint led to her death.This was a direct injury to the nerve and hence chances of the virus reaching the brain before the vaccine could act were very high. The cubital fossa is a junction through which major nerves and blood vessels travel, Dr S Bindu, superintendent of SAT Hospital, said.Niya's body was laid to rest at Alenchery Muslim Jamaat mosque. As part of the protocol, her body was not taken home or kept for public viewing. Her mother has been placed under quarantine.The back-to-back deaths of three children owing to rabies despite receiving vaccination have reignited the debate over stray dog menace and the effectiveness and quality control of vaccines in the state.The opposition accused the govt of mismanagement, while MB Rajesh, state minister, blamed the Centre's ""impractical"" animal birth control norms for the situation. According to health department statistics, 22 people have died of rabies in the state since 2021, despite receiving the vaccine.Dr KV Viswanath, joint director of medical education, said the vaccine could not be blamed for the tragic outcome. The vaccine's effectiveness depends on the wound's severity and the rate of viral transmission, he said. Niya was given three doses of the vaccine but succumbed to the rabies virus before she could be administered the fourth dose on May 6. A bite on areas like the face, neck, and elbow could lead to the virus reaching the brain and spinal cord before the vaccine can generate antibodies, the doctor said.","Niya, who was bitten by a dog on April 8, received three doses of the anti- rabies vaccine and immunoglobulin serum.

Wayne Gretzky's Donald Trump ties spark anger during politically sensitive moment

Hockey legend’s recent actions raise eyebrows north of the border

Wayne Gretzky , long celebrated as Canada ’s greatest hockey icon, is now facing an unfamiliar role—not on the ice, but in the center of a political firestorm. The backlash against “The Great One” has intensified in recent weeks as Canadians grapple with his increasingly visible friendship with former U.S. President Donald Trump The controversy erupted following Donald Trump’s recent interview with The Atlantic, where he addressed Wayne Gretzky’s situation head-on. “I love Canada,” Trump said, before revealing a private conversation with the hockey legend . “I said to Wayne, ‘I’m gonna give you a pass, Wayne… Just pretend you don’t know me.’” The remark, meant to shield Gretzky from the fallout, has only fueled the perception that the former NHL star is too close to a deeply unpopular figure in Canada.The timing of this revelation couldn’t be more explosive. Canadian political tensions with the U.S. are already at a boiling point. Donald Trump’s past statements suggesting Canada could become America’s 51st state, coupled with escalating trade wars and inflammatory rhetoric, have frayed nerves across the border. According to a Politico/Focaldata poll, 75% of Canadians hold an unfavorable view of President Trump.Wayne Gretzky’s decision to give a thumbs-up to American players and skip wearing Canadian colors during the 4 Nations Face-Off final in February didn’t go unnoticed. Critics saw the gesture as unpatriotic, especially after images surfaced of Gretzky donning a MAGA hat at Trump’s 2024 election celebration at Mar-a-Lago. His attendance at Trump’s inauguration alongside his wife further fanned the flames.Though Gretzky has yet to comment publicly, Canadian sentiment has shifted sharply. Once untouchable, he’s now the subject of social media scrutiny and national debate.In his victory speech after a surprising Liberal Party comeback, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney directly addressed Trump’s growing influence. “President Trump is trying to break us so America can own us. That will never, ever happen,” Carney said defiantly.Also Read: Throwback to a historic moment: Semyon Varlamov’s record-breaking shutout streak remains a defining chapter in Islanders history Whether Wayne Gretzky speaks out or stays silent, the damage may already be done—for his reputation, and perhaps for Canada’s perception of one of its most beloved sons.",Hockey legend Wayne Gretzky is facing backlash for his friendship with Donald Trump.

An Indian-origin student of the University of California, Berkeley, had her dreams shattered after she fell at least 12 feet at a fraternity house party. Doctors said Bandna Bhatti , the 21-year-old student, was paralyzed from the waist down after she slipped and fell from an external metal staircase at the Phi Kappa Tau house. Her family has been seeking help for her medical care.According to reports, after the tragic fall, Bandna remained there for 15 minutes until she was discovered by her friends who pulled her inside but the frat house allegedly told them to leave and so Bhatti was brought to a nearby apartment as her friends did not understand the extent of her injury. 911 was not called until seven hours after the fall.“Our beloved sister, Bandna, only 21 years old, was just three weeks away from graduating from UC Berkeley with a degree in Data Science — a milestone she had worked so hard for — when our world was turned upside down,” her sister Sonya Bhatti wrote in a GoFundMe page created to raise money for the college senior’s medical care.Apart from paralyzing spinal fracture, Bhatti also sustained tearing of the dura with spinal fluid leakage, a scapular fracture, and a brain hematoma.Police are looking into the incident but have not revealed any details of the investigation.The university issued a statement and offered support to Bhatti. “UC Berkeley is aware of an ongoing police investigation regarding reports of a student being injured near or at a fraternity,” UC Berkeley said in a statement to PEOPLE. “Our thoughts are with the student, their family, loved ones and friends during this time. We are following our protocols to offer support to the student and their family.”“Bandna is a brilliant, compassionate, and resilient young woman who has worked tirelessly toward her dreams.

Shannon Sharpe’s ex girlfriend, Michele Evans, shares her story of being in a relationship with him and being assaulted by him when she tried to end their relationship

Michele Evans filed a restraining order against Shannon Sharpe shortly after the assault in 2010, as claimed by her

Shannon Sharpe had a pretty successful career while he was playing in the NFL, and even after he retired from it, he turned to hosting and made a huge amount of money through it. But his life completely changed a few days ago when an OnlyFans model accused him of sexually assaulting her and sued him for $50 million. Now, another woman has sparked controversy as she claims to have been threatened by Shannon Sharpe.Recently, as per the U.S. Sun, a woman named Michele Evans has claimed to be Shannon Sharpe’s girlfriend while he was playing in the NFL. According to her, their relationship began in 2002 and lasted till 2010. At this point, Michele Evans was married to another woman but was still with the NFL legend.Michele Evans has now claimed that Shannon Sharpe had sexually assaulted her and when she filed a restraining order against him in 2010, he had reportedly threatened her.According to the U.S. Sun, Michele Evans spoke about their break up in 2010 that she had initiated when she caught Shannon Sharpe cheating on her.

What Xi Jinping's Moscow visit won’t show: The Chinese dying for Russia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/chinese-citizens-fighting-in-russia-ukraine-war-xi-jinping-vladimir-putin/articleshow/120903335.cms,"Why it matters

The big picture

The backdrop to Xi’s visit is a war entering its third year and a global order in flux. Moscow and Beijing declared a “no limits” partnership in early 2022-just weeks before Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

That alliance has since expanded to include economic lifelines, diplomatic cover, and military cooperation that has raised alarms across Western capitals.

Putin, speaking in a state TV documentary on the eve of Xi’s visit, described the relationship as “deep-seated” and “truly strategic in nature.”

A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said both countries will “lead global governance in the correct direction” and work against “unilateralism and bullying acts.”

But this show of unity is shadowed by the stories of Chinese men-lured by pay, propaganda, or patriotism-who now say they were treated as expendable.

Xi’s tightrope

What they are saying

“As a former professional soldier in China, I thought there had to be a way for me to contribute,” he said. “Now I know it was a mistake.”

Michael is not alone.

As per an Economist report, Zhou Zhiqiang, another mercenary, told followers that Russian commanders treated them as “cannon fodder.”

Zhao Rui, a 38-year-old from Chongqing, joined to fight “any Japanese helping Ukraine” and died after being hit by a drone.

Others complained of poor gear, hunger, psychological torment, and being thrown into suicidal missions.

One former Chinese prison guard who fought with Russia said he did it out of a vague hero complex, not money. But now, back home, he’s under travel restrictions-possibly linked to his service.

“The world’s number two military is a sheer joke,” Michael said of Russia, citing corruption, cruelty, and incompetent leadership. “They don’t care how many of us are killed.”

Zoom in: Recruitment and regrets

Michael said Russian soldiers who complained were caged, beaten, or disappeared.

One Chinese fighter died trying to escape the front.

Videos from Chinese mercenaries have shown poor shelter, frostbite, and funerals for fellow countrymen.

Many described the front as a “conveyor belt of death.”

Between the lines

While Ukraine has also used foreign fighters, including a handful of Chinese nationals motivated by ideology, most Chinese combatants in this war have joined Russia. Their motives range from money and disillusionment to nationalistic fervor.

“I just want to wander,” one fighter told CNN. “As a man, I have had a kind of hero complex since my childhood.”

Yet, many said they were misled-by Chinese state media’s pro-Russia framing, by fellow mercenaries on Douyin, and by their own illusions.

Jason, a Chinese-American volunteer who fought with Ukraine’s International Legion, said he joined partly out of a belief in protecting Taiwan. His great-grandfather died fighting the Chinese Communists. “Most Chinese people are brainwashed,” he said.

Sophie, a Chinese PhD student hoping to join Ukraine’s forces, said time abroad shattered her trust in Chinese state messaging. “I used to be pretty indifferent to politics,” she told CNN. “Not anymore.”

What’s next





Chinese President Xi Jinping is set to visit Russia from May 7-10 to join President Vladimir Putin for the 80th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany. He will also hold talks to deepen strategic ties and witness the signing of a raft of bilateral agreements.But the pageantry of Xi’s Moscow trip comes with rising geopolitical and moral costs: a growing number of Chinese nationals are fighting in Ukraine-mostly for Russia-and many are coming back dead, mutilated, or broken.Some survivors have begun to speak out, warning others not to make the same mistake.“I have to speak out some truths and warn those irrational Chinese -don’t come over here,” said one Chinese fighter, nicknamed Michael, who told CNN he was locked in a steel-barred pit by Russian commanders for 21 days after a dispute over body armor.Xi’s appearance beside Putin sends a global signal that Beijing remains steadfast in its partnership with Moscow-despite the war, Western sanctions, and a swirl of allegations about China’s tacit military support for Russia.President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has publicly accused China of supplying gunpowder and dual-use components for Russian weapons, and said more than 150 Chinese nationals have joined Moscow’s war effort.“We are not saying that someone gave any command. We do not have such information,” Zelenskyy said. “But we are investigating.”Beijing, while insisting it remains “neutral,” has denied any state involvement, calling the allegations “groundless.” But it acted swiftly: Chinese censors began erasing social media accounts of mercenaries like Michael who had posted about their wartime experiences.The Chinese state maintains a delicate line: politically supportive of Russia, economically helpful, militarily aloof. Beijing purchases vast quantities of Russian oil and gas, sells dual-use components that sustain the war effort, and repeats Moscow’s talking points about Nato provocation. At the same time, it insists on “non-interference” and denies supplying arms or fighters.But the existence of Chinese boots on the ground - even if unofficial - makes that line harder to walk. Some Chinese fighters have clearly entered the war as freelancers, using tourist visas and connecting with Wagner or Russian regular units once inside. But others, like the two men captured by Ukraine, raise the uncomfortable question: just how unofficial is this unofficial war?If Chinese nationals continue to die in a war Beijing won’t acknowledge, how long before public pressure forces Xi’s hand - diplomatically, legally, or otherwise?So far, the response has been silence.Michael, a 29-year-old Chinese national and former member of the People’s Liberation Army, told CNN he joined Wagner in 2023 after seeing a Chinese-subtitled Russian military recruitment video on Douyin (China’s TikTok).Chinese fighters say they were attracted by Russian military propaganda promising up to 200,000 rubles ($2,400) a month and bonuses for territory captured—much more than they earned back home.The social media ads played to nationalism and masculinity: “Aren’t you a man? Be a real man!” read one in Chinese.But behind the bravado lies brutal reality:Despite the horrors, Beijing has said little. But the quick censorship of social media posts indicates officials are aware-and wary-of the narrative spinning out of control.Xi and Putin will present their partnership as a stabilizing force amid global disorder. Behind closed doors, they’ll likely ink new energy, defense, and trade deals-further insulating each other from Western sanctions.But on the battlefield, the fallout is growing.Ukraine says it will continue investigating whether Chinese citizens are being encouraged-or allowed-to fight on Russia’s side. And as more survivors speak out, the human cost is cutting through China’s Great Firewall.(With inputs from agencies)","Chinese President Xi Jinping is set to visit Russia from May 7-10 to join President Vladimir Putin for the 80th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany.

What happened between Kevin Garnett and his girlfriend Teare Candelier?

Kevin Garnett found himself in the middle of some personal drama after his girlfriend reportedly called the police during a tense argument late last month. Approximately one week after Teare Candelier called the police around 2 a.m. on Sunday, April 27, during a domestic argument at their Los Angeles residence, the retired NBA player and his partner released a joint statement.""We deeply regret that a personal disagreement escalated and inappropriately involved authorities,"" the couple wrote in a joint statement on Sunday. ""It was never our intention to involve others in a moment that should have remained private.""""Like most couples, we have disagreements, but our commitment to each other remains strong, and we move forward with renewed respect, understanding, and love,"" their message added.The statement was issued after news sources reported that police responded to an intense argument between Garnett and Candelier at their home. According to insiders, Garnett had already left when officers arrived, but a report was still filed. Sources claim the argument did not become physical, except when Garnett moved Candelier from a doorway while trying to leave. Candelier reportedly declined medical attention.This incident isn't Garnett's first legal issue involving a partner. In 2023, Necat Akman, who stated Garnett was the father of her child, won a custody case that resulted in a court-mandated child support agreement. In court documents, Garnett officially recognised himself as the father of a young girl named Naya Garnett, signing a statement confirming his biological paternity. The agreement stipulated that Naya would reside in New York with her mother, Akman, who would have sole legal and physical custody. Garnett was granted visitation rights, with specifics to be determined later.","Kevin Garnett and his girlfriend, Teare Candelier, released a joint statement expressing regret after a domestic argument led to police involvement at their Los Angeles home.

The MAGA Claim: Did She Marry Her Brother?



Investigations and Findings



What the Fact-Checkers Say



PolitiFact concluded that while questions existed around dates and filings, “there is no verified evidence that Elmi is Omar’s brother.”

Snopes categorised the claim as unproven, noting that the story relied on “anonymous sources and unverifiable documents.”

FactCheck.org called the allegation part of a “broader pattern of misinformation targeting Omar.”

Omar’s Response



The Final Word







A resurfaced interview. A MAGA-fuelled conspiracy. A flurry of expletives. And once again, Congresswoman Ilhan Omar finds herself in the middle of America’s ever-churning culture wars.This latest firestorm began with conservative activist Laura Loomer re-posting a 2018 clip of Omar telling journalist Mehdi Hasan: “Our country should be more fearful of white men... we should be profiling, monitoring, and creating policies to fight the radicalisation of white men.”Originally broadcast with little fanfare, the clip has been weaponised in 2025 amid renewed political polarisation. Loomer labelled Omar a “jihadist member of Congress,” accusing her—without evidence—of having ties to Hamas, the Muslim Brotherhood, and ISIS.Then came the second act of the outrage cycle. When a Washington reporter asked Omar if more Democrats should meet Kilmar Abrego Garcia—a Salvadoran man deported by the Trump administration and alleged to have MS-13 links—Omar snapped: “I think you should f*** off.”When asked if she meant him specifically, she clarified: “You.” She later doubled down on X (formerly Twitter), writing: “I said what I said. You and all you miserable trolls can f*** off.As her critics piled on, one of the MAGA’s oldest and most persistent attacks resurfaced: that Ilhan Omar once married her biological brother in order to commit immigration fraud.The claim dates back to 2016, first floated on a Somali-American internet forum. It alleges that Omar’s 2009 marriage to British citizen Ahmed Nur Said Elmi was not only a sham—but that Elmi was, in fact, her biological brother. The motive, according to the theory, was to secure a path to US citizenship for him.Social media posts showing Omar and Elmi together were taken as circumstantial evidence, and the internet did what the internet does best: turned conjecture into certainty. Prominent figures in conservative media—ranging from Laura Loomer to Donald Trump Jr.—amplified the theory. “She married her brother” became a meme, a slur, and a rallying cry for critics of Omar.In 2019, The Minneapolis Star Tribune—Omar’s hometown newspaper—conducted an extensive investigation. It found discrepancies in her marriage and tax filings, as well as puzzling gaps in documentation. But on the central allegation, the paper was blunt: “We could neither conclusively confirm nor rebut the allegation that Elmi is Omar’s sibling.”Later, in 2020, the FBI reportedly reviewed the case, alongside Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Education. Yet none of the agencies pressed charges, nor did they release any evidence implicating Omar in wrongdoing.In short: where there should be documentation—birth certificates, DNA tests, family statements—there was only innuendo.All major fact-checking organisations have reviewed the claim. None have found it credible.The New York Post, Business Insider, and The Times of India have all reviewed the saga in detail, with similar conclusions: no documents proving a biological relationship, no legal confirmation, and no charges filed despite years of scrutiny.Omar has dismissed the claim from the beginning, calling it “absurd and offensive.” In response to a viral 2025 post that claimed to finally “confirm” the brother marriage theory, she posted on X: “The only thing that is confirmed is your stupidity. Hope that helps.” She has consistently argued that the allegations are politically motivated attacks rooted in racism, Islamophobia, and misogyny.There is no verified evidence that Ilhan Omar married her brother. Multiple investigations, including one by the FBI, found no wrongdoing. Fact-checkers have labelled the claim unsubstantiated. Omar herself has firmly denied it.But the durability of the rumour says more about America’s political landscape than it does about Omar’s personal life. As long as outrage remains currency in US politics, the truth may remain beside the point.","The claim dates back to 2016, first floated on a Somali-American internet forum.

"US court blocks Donald Trump's bid to end legal status for 400,000 migrants",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-court-blocks-donald-trumps-bid-to-end-legal-status-for-400000-migrants/articleshow/120915511.cms,"



US President Donald Trump’s bid to end temporary legal status for thousands of migrants was faced with rejection from a federal appeals court, giving a blow to his ongoing immigration crackdown aimed at increasing deportations.This appeal was as a part of his latest efforts to curb legal status and deport migrants including Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans, even those previously protected under existing programmes.The Boston-based 1st US circuit court of appeals on Monday declined to suspend a previous ruling that had blocked the department of homeland security (DHS) from ending a two-year humanitarian parole granted under former President Joe Biden. That order had prevented DHS from abruptly revoking the migrants’ right to remain and work in the United States.Trump officials argued that homeland security secretary Kristi Noem had the authority to cancel the parole en masse, and claimed that the court’s block was effectively forcing the government to “retain hundreds of thousands of aliens in the country against its will,” Reuters reported.However, the three-judge panel, all appointed by Democratic presidents, dismissed that claim, arguing that Noem ""has not at this point made a 'strong showing' that her categorical termination of plaintiffs' parole is likely to be sustained on appeal.""Karen Tumlin, a lawyer with the justice action center which brought the legal challenge, praised the court’s decision calling that the administration’s actions “reckless and illegal.”The dispute arose from a lawsuit by immigrant rights advocates over the Biden-era parole programmes, which had allowed migrants from countries including Ukraine, Afghanistan, and Latin America to enter the US on humanitarian grounds.While that legal battle continued, the homeland security department announced in a Federal Register on 25 March that it would end the two-year parole status for around 400,000 people, prompting swift legal action.US district judge Indira Talwani, who had initially halted the policy, ruled on 25 April that the department had wrongly applied the law by attempting to cancel parole status categorically rather than reviewing cases individually. She said the decision was based on a legal error and misinterpreted the agency’s ability to deport individuals through proper legal channels.The US department of homeland security is yet to comment on the ruling.","US President Donald Trump's bid to end temporary legal status for thousands of migrants was faced with rejection from a federal appeals court.

'Genocidal language': JD Vance blasts Ilhan Omar's call to 'profile white men',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/genocidal-language-jd-vance-blasts-ilhan-omars-call-to-profile-white-men/articleshow/120915138.cms,"



Vice President JD Vance sharply condemned Congresswoman Ilhan Omar ’s remarks calling for the profiling and monitoring of white men in the United States, labelling them as “genocidal language.” The controversy stems from a resurfaced 2018 interview in which Omar suggested that the US should be more focused on the threat posed by white men, arguing that they were responsible for the majority of deaths in the country.Omar, speaking to journalist Mehdi Hasan, explained her stance on national security, saying: “I would say our country should be more fearful of white men across our country because they are actually causing most of the deaths within this country.” She continued, “And so if fear was the driving force of policies to keep America safe, Americans safe inside of this country, we should be profiling, monitoring, and creating policies to fight the radicalisation of white men. ”Vance, did not hold back in his condemnation. He referred to Omar’s comments as “genocidal language,” adding, “What a disgrace this person is.”In response, Omar pushed back, defending her remarks in a statement. She clarified, “In this nearly 8-year-old clip, I am referring to the rise of white nationalism in an annual report issued by the Anti-Defamation League that said white supremacists were responsible for 78 percent of ‘extremist-related murders.’”Omar also took the opportunity to challenge Vance’s use of the term “genocidal,” suggesting he should “look up what ‘genocidal’ actually means when you’re actively supporting a genocide taking place in Gaza. ”This comment, which resurfaced when conservative activist Laura Loomer shared the video again, reignited the debate over Omar’s views. Loomer, who has previously criticised Omar for her alleged ties to extremist groups, posted the video with the caption: “Ilhan Omar, a jihadist member of Congress who has documented ties to HAMAS, the Muslim Brotherhood and ISIS, says jihadists aren’t a threat and we should instead be creating policies and databases here in the US to ‘profile white men,’ who she says are the biggest terror threat.”This controversy comes on the heels of a separate incident where Omar found herself under fire for an expletive-laden response to a reporter. When asked about a controversial deportee, Omar angrily told the journalist, “I think you should f**k off,” before later defending the exchange online.","Congresswoman Ilhan Omar called for the profiling and monitoring of white men in the United States.

Pete Hegseth orders 20% cut in senior generals across the Pentagon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hegseth-orders-20-cut-in-senior-generals-across-the-pentagon/articleshow/120914638.cms,"



US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has announced a 20% cut to the number of four-star generals and admirals across all military branches. The move, which applies across all military branches, comes amid wider efforts to reduce the federal government’s size and restructure its leadership along ideological lines.The directive, revealed in a memo signed by Hegseth, also calls for a 20% cut to top-ranking officers in the National Guard and an overall 10% reduction in general and flag officers across the military. These cuts follow a wave of firings in recent months, including the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. CQ Brown Jr., and the only two women serving as four-star officers. Hegseth defended the firings as necessary to align military leadership with the administration’s national security agenda The Pentagon has about 900 general and flag officers, with just 44 holding four-star rank. Congress was not given advance notification of the cuts, raising further concern. Representative Seth Moulton, a Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee and a former Marine, accused the administration of deliberately trying to politicise the military, warning it could erode confidence in the chain of command.Hegseth has been vocal in his disdain for what he calls the military’s “social justice agenda,” including diversity and inclusion efforts, transgender service policies, and climate programmes.In recent podcasts, he accused senior officers of catering to ideological trends in Washington and vowed to dismantle what he sees as “redundant bureaucratic layers.”The cuts come alongside a broader overhaul of the defence establishment. Last week, Hegseth ordered the Army to eliminate outdated equipment, shut down headquarters, and reassign thousands of Pentagon staff to frontline units. A military parade to mark Trump’s birthday and the Army’s 250th anniversary is also being planned, reportedly at significant expense.Meanwhile, intelligence agencies are facing similar downsizing. Around 1,200 CIA positions are being cut, largely through early retirements. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, led by Tulsi Gabbard, has already reduced staff by 25%.",Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has announced a 20% cut to the number of four- star generals and admirals across all military branches.

Trump administration blocks billion-dollar Harvard funding as White House demands sweeping overhaul,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-administration-blocks-billion-dollar-harvard-funding-as-white-house-demands-sweeping-overhaul/articleshow/120914376.cms,"(File photo)

Federal pressure mounts over campus policy and free speech

Trump vs Harvard





The Trump administration has announced that Harvard University will be barred from receiving any new federal research grants until it complies with a set of demands laid out by the White House. The move escalates a months-long standoff between the administration and the Ivy League institution, amid accusations that Harvard has failed in its responsibilities regarding antisemitism , academic standards, and campus management.In a letter to Harvard President Alan Garber, Education Secretary Linda McMahon accused the university of “consistent violations of its legal duties” and declared that the institution will no longer be eligible for publicly funded research. “Harvard has made a mockery of this country’s higher education system,” McMahon wrote, citing the school’s handling of protests, foreign student admissions, and diversity initiatives as key concerns.The action does not affect student financial aid or federal loan programmes, but it could impact more than $1 billion annually in research funding. The administration had already frozen $2.2 billion in ongoing multi-year grants.The administration is demanding wide-ranging changes from Harvard, including the elimination of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programmes, stricter control over protests, mandatory merit-based admissions and hiring, and increased viewpoint diversity among faculty.Additionally, the White House is pressuring the university to review its international student programme and report any foreign student found to have violated codes of conduct or expressed anti-American sentiment.A senior official said Harvard must demonstrate “responsible management” and enter into negotiations with federal agencies to resolve ongoing investigations, including several civil rights inquiries launched in early 2025. The administration has also threatened to revoke Harvard’s tax-exempt status and block it from hosting foreign students unless its demands are met.Garber has refused to comply, stating that “no government—regardless of which party is in power—should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of inquiry they can pursue.” Harvard has filed a lawsuit, describing the funding freeze as “arbitrary and capricious,” and a violation of the university’s First Amendment rights.Despite its $53 billion endowment, federal funding makes up over 10% of Harvard’s annual revenue. The Trump administration’s measures come amid a broader push to reshape higher education institutions it accuses of ideological bias and inadequate protection of Jewish students.Negotiations remain possible, but until Harvard agrees to the administration’s conditions, it faces exclusion from new federal research opportunities.The feud between Harvard University and the Trump administration has intensified rapidly since January 2025, when President Trump signed an executive order targeting antisemitism on college campuses. The Department of Justice and Education swiftly followed up with investigations, meetings, and funding threats. In March, Harvard was officially placed under review, with billions in federal grants at stake.By April, the administration demanded sweeping changes, including the closure of DEI programmes and reforms to admissions and foreign student policies. Harvard refused, calling the demands unconstitutional. As tensions peaked, the administration froze $2.2 billion in funding and declared the university ineligible for new grants.On May 6, all research funding was halted, with Education Secretary Linda McMahon accusing Harvard of failing to address antisemitism and uphold academic standards. The university has responded with legal action, claiming government overreach and a violation of its independence. The standoff now marks a pivotal moment in the national culture war.","The move escalates a months-long standoff between the administration and the Ivy League institution.

The Trump administration has launched a sweeping initiative to track down over 450,000 migrant children who entered the United States unaccompanied during Joe Biden ’s presidency. Officials claim the move is aimed at safeguarding the children, particularly those placed with adult sponsors such as relatives or family friends. But immigration advocates fear it could lead to surveillance, intimidation, and deportation of undocumented caretakers.Rights groups have sounded the alarm over the deployment of Homeland Security and FBI agents to conduct door-to-door checks and interviews. They describe the effort as an intimidation campaign targeting families, with potential consequences including the deportation of undocumented sponsors.“Now you have a situation where the government is checking on the wellness of children and encountering their undocumented parents and deporting their parents,” said Mary Miller Flowers, policy director at the Young Center for Immigrant Children’s Rights. “I don't know what about that is good for children.”The Trump way of tracking migrant children:A senior official from the department of health and human services (HHS) revealed that since 2023, around 65,000 complaints have been filed regarding unaccompanied minors—ranging from sponsor misconduct to children reportedly going missing. Of these, about 450 cases have been referred to law enforcement this year alone.In the past two months, around 100 children have been removed from their sponsors and placed back in federal custody, often in private shelters.One particularly disturbing case emerged in Cleveland, where a man living in the US illegally claimed custody of a 14-year-old Guatemalan girl using a forged birth certificate. He falsely said he was her brother, and federal authorities later discovered he had sexually assaulted her. The man pleaded guilty to sexual battery and was sentenced to eight years in prison. He now faces additional charges, including identity theft and smuggling.The department of justice has confirmed it is investigating suspicious patterns of guardianship, especially involving individuals dubbed “super sponsors” who have taken custody of over a dozen children. These reviews often involve armed law enforcement officers conducting in-person welfare checks across the country.In a statement, the FBI said, “Protecting children is a critical mission,” adding that it is working with federal, state, and local agencies. HHS echoed this position, stating: “We’re combing through every report, every detail — because protecting children isn’t optional.”For years, the US government has allowed adults to sponsor unaccompanied minors, but recent watchdog reports have raised concerns about fraud and lax screening. The Biden administration introduced reforms to strengthen vetting, including enhanced training and monitoring, but Trump-era officials argue the system remains vulnerable to exploitation.While many children have successfully reunited with legitimate caregivers, growing anxiety in migrant communities reflects concerns that welfare visits may be a pretext for immigration enforcement. Even families who followed legal procedures worry they could now be targeted.","The Trump administration has launched a sweeping initiative to track down over 450,000 migrant children who entered the United States unaccompanied during Joe Biden ’s presidency.

A man in his 70s was arrested after crashing his car through the gates of Jennifer Aniston ’s Bel-Air home on Monday afternoon while the actress was inside. The incident unfolded shortly after noon in Los Angeles, prompting an immediate response from Aniston’s private security team, who reportedly removed the driver from his vehicle and detained him at gunpoint.TMZ and CBS News reported that the security team quickly secured the man and waited for police to arrive. The Los Angeles Police Department responded to what they classified as a burglary call, though the suspect was already in custody when they arrived. Aniston did not interact with the man and was unharmed during the ordeal, according to police.Officials told ABC7 that the suspect was booked for felony property damage due to the force of the crash. While some insiders suggested the incident may have been accidental, others said the way the man drove into the gate did not appear accidental. At this stage, authorities are not treating the case as a targeted attack on Aniston.The LAPD confirmed that Aniston was home at the time of the crash and have launched a full investigation to determine the man’s motives. His background is being scrutinised, though preliminary findings indicate he has a minor criminal record.So far, there is no evidence he was intentionally targeting the actress.Representatives for Aniston have declined to comment, and the LAPD is continuing its inquiries into the circumstances surrounding the crash. The event has raised renewed concerns around celebrity security and residential safety in affluent Los Angeles neighbourhoods.No injuries were reported, but there was visible damage to the property. Investigators are still working to clarify whether the act was deliberate or a result of confusion or error. The suspect remains in custody as further assessments are made.","A man in his 70s was arrested after crashing his car through the gates of Jennifer Aniston ’s Bel-Air home on Monday afternoon.

"Threatened by Trump tariffs, Japan walks a delicate tightrope between US and China",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/threatened-by-trump-tariffs-japan-walks-a-delicate-tightrope-between-us-and-china/articleshow/120915263.cms,"US president Donald Trump, left, with Chinese president Xi Jinping (Image credits: AP)





WASHINGTON: Just as Japan 's top trade negotiator traveled to Washington for another round of tariff talks last week, a bipartisan delegation bearing the name of ""Japan-China Friendship"" wrapped up a visit to Beijing.A week earlier, the head of the junior party in Japan's ruling coalition was in Beijing delivering a letter from Japanese prime minister Shigeru Ishiba addressed to Chinese president Xi Jinping . Details of the letter are unknown, but the two sides discussed US tariffs in addition to bilateral issues.Among all US allies being wooed by Beijing in its tariff stare-down with Washington, Japan stands out.It is a peculiar case not only for its staunch commitment to its alliance with the United States but also for its complicated and uneasy history with the neighboring Asian giant, particularly the war history from the 20th century that still casts a shadow over the politics of today.""On one hand, they are neighbors and they are important economic partners. There's a lot that connects Japan and China,"" said Matthew Goodman, director of the Greenberg Center for Geoeconomics at the council on foreign relations. ""But on the other hand, I think there are limits to how far they're going to lean into China.""While Japan won't walk away from its alliance with the United States, the linchpin of the Asian country's diplomacy and security policies, ""it's also true that the tariffs and uncertainty that Trump has created for Japan is really shaking things up in Tokyo,"" Goodman said.Last month, President Donald Trump announced a 24 per cent tariff on Japanese goods in a sweeping plan to levy duties on about 90 countries. The White House has since paused the tariffs but a 10 per cent baseline duty on all countries except China, allowing time for negotiations. Still, Trump's 25 per cent tax on aluminum, steel and auto exports have gone into effect for Japan.The tariff moves, as well as Trump's ""America First"" agenda, have cast doubts among the Japanese if the United States is still a dependable ally, while China is rallying support from tariff-threatened countries - including Japan.In Beijing, Japan sees positive signs When Tetsuo Saito led Japan's Komeito Party delegation to Beijing in late April, China hinted at difficulty in its tariff dispute with the United States, signaling its willingness to improve ties with Tokyo. An unnamed senior Chinese official said his country was ""in trouble"" when discussing Trump's 145 per cent tariff on Chinese products, according to Japanese reports.Saito's visit was soon followed by that of the bipartisan delegation of Japan-China Friendship Parliamentarians' Union. Zhao Leji , Beijing's top legislator, told the delegation that China's National People's Congress would be ""willing to carry out various forms of dialogue and exchanges.""Beijing did not lift a ban on Japan's seafood imports as the Japanese delegates hoped, but it signaled positive signs on its assessment of the safety of the discharges of treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Beijing banned Japan's seafood products in 2023, citing those concerns.Ties between Tokyo and Beijing have long been rocky. In the past several years, they squabbled not only over the seafood ban but also long-standing territorial disputes over the Senkaku, or Diaoyu, islands in the East China Sea, Beijing's growing military assertiveness and violence against Japanese nationals in China, an issue complicated by the nations' uneasy history.Tokyo's closer ties with Washington during Joe Biden's presidency also upset Beijing, which saw it as part of the US strategy to contain China and has lectured Tokyo to ""face squarely and reflect on the history of aggression.""An imperial power in Asia for centuries, China fell behind Japan in the 19th century when Japan began to embrace Western industrialization and grew into a formidable economic and military power. It invaded China in the 1930s and controlled the northeastern territory known as Manchuria. War atrocities, including the Nanking Massacre and the use of chemical and biological weapons and human medical experiments in Manchuria, have left deep scars in China. They have yet to be healed, though Japan's conservative politicians today still attempt to deny the aggression.Ishiba, elected Japan's prime minister in October, has a more neutral view on his country's wartime history than the late prime minister Shinzo Abe and his two successors. Weeks after taking office, Ishiba held talks with Xi on the sidelines of a leaders' summit.Chinese scholars, however, see Tokyo's recent engagements with Beijing as a pragmatic move to hedge against US protectionism and not a long-term strategy for stability with China.The odds are low for Japan to move into China's orbit, Goodman said. ""They have for a long time had to manage an important but challenging relationship with China,"" he said. ""And that is, again, a long-standing problem for Japan, going back centuries or millennia.""Seeking tariff deals and stable ties in the US While Japan might welcome the friendlier tone from Beijing, it is trying to stabilize Japan-US relations under Trump's ""America First"" agenda, and it is hoping to settle the tariff dispute without confronting Washington, with an eye on preventing Beijing from exploiting any fallout in Japan-US relations.Japan was among the first countries to hold tariff talks with Washington. During the first round in mid-April, Trump inserted himself into the discussions, a sign of the high stakes for the United States to reach a deal with Japan. The Trump administration reportedly pushed for Japan to buy more US-made cars and open its market to US beef, rice and potatoes.After the second round of negotiation in Washington last week, Ryosei Akazawa , the country's chief tariff negotiator, said he pushed Japan's request that the US drop tariffs and was continuing efforts toward an agreement acceptable to both sides. He said Japan's auto industry was already hurting from the 25 per cent tariff and that he needed to be ""thorough but fast.""Asked about China, Akazawa said only that his country keeps watching the US-China tariff development ""with great interest."" He noted Japan's deep trade ties with China.Competing in Southeast Asia While China and Japan are working to mend ties, the two are also competing in the Southeast Asia region, where Trump has threatened high tariffs as well. The region is deeply integrated into China's supply chain but under pressure from the West to diversify and reduce its reliance on China. With younger and growing populations as compared to East Asia, the region is considered an important growth center.Japan, as a major postwar development aid contributor, has gradually regained trust in the region, which also was scarred by Japan's World War II past.On Wednesday, Ishiba returned from Vietnam and the Philippines after agreeing with their leaders to further strengthen security and economic ties. During the visit, Ishiba stressed Japan's commitment to maintaining and strengthening a multilateral free-trade system in each country. Ishiba also had telephone talks with his Malaysian and Singaporean counterparts earlier this month about US tariffs.Just weeks earlier, Xi was in Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia, also stressing free trade and seeking stronger supply chains.At a recent discussion at the Washington-based think tank Hudson Institute, Itsunori Onodera, Japan's governing party policy chief, warned of ""very unstable"" feelings among many Asian countries faced with high tariffs from the United States.""There's a danger they might become more distant and become closer to China,"" Onodera said. ""This is not something that Japan wants, either.""",Japan stands out among all US allies being wooed by Beijing in its tariff stare- down with Washington.

A small boat believed to be carrying migrants capsized off the coast of San Diego on Monday morning, leaving three people dead, four injured, and seven missing. The US Coast Guard responded promptly, deploying a helicopter and boat to search for the missing individuals. Among the affected individuals is an Indian family, with two children still unaccounted for, while the parents are receiving medical treatment at Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla.The Consulate General of India in San Francisco has expressed their sorrow over the tragedy and is providing assistance to the family in coordination with local authorities.The incident occurred about 35 miles north of the Mexico border near Torrey Pines State Beach, shortly after sunrise. The boat, a panga—an open fishing vessel commonly used by smugglers—flipped in the ocean, according to US Coast Guard Petty Officer Chris Sappey. Authorities believe the passengers were migrants, noting that such vessels are often used to evade heavily patrolled land borders. Migrants frequently rely on smugglers to navigate the dangerous seas in an effort to avoid detection.The injured were taken to Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, where they are being treated for respiratory issues.Among the injured are three adults in their 30s and one teenager. The hospital did not provide further details on their conditions. Winds in the area were light, with waves reaching approximately six feet, making the conditions hazardous but not extreme.Hikers at Torrey Pines State Beach reported seeing the boat capsize at around 6.30am (local time). A doctor hiking nearby rushed to the scene, offering assistance and performing CPR on the victims. The search continues for the remaining missing individuals, while authorities investigate the cause of the tragedy.This incident is another in a series of deadly maritime smuggling cases along the US West Coast. In 2023, eight people died when a migrant smuggling boat capsized near San Diego, one of the deadliest such incidents in recent history. Last year, the UN reported a record high number of fatalities among migrants attempting to cross borders, with nearly 9,000 people losing their lives worldwide.","A small boat believed to be carrying migrants capsized off the coast of San Diego on Monday morning, leaving three people dead, four injured, and seven missing.

Europe makes a pitch to lure scientists shunned by US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/europe-makes-a-pitch-to-lure-scientists-shunned-by-us/articleshow/120914358.cms,"This is a Reuters' story





The European Union and France on Monday announced half a billion euros worth of incentives to lure scientists to the continent, seeking to profit from US President Trump’s federal funding cuts and clashes with top US universities.“We call on researchers worldwide to unite and join us ... If you love freedom, come and help us stay free,” French President Emmanuel Macron said at Paris’ Sorbonne University alongside European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen . The money would fund research projects and help universities cover the cost of bringing foreign scientists over to help run them, officials said. Von der Leyen announced the 500 mn euros ($566.6 mn) incentive package and said she also wanted EU member states to invest 3% of GDP in research and development by 2030. Macron pledged 100 million from France, though it was not yet clear if this came on top of the EU pledge.Trump has targeted US universities since taking office in Jan by freezing federal funding, launching investigations, revoking international students’ visas and making other demands. Last week, he said his administration will revoke Harvard University ’s tax-exempt status, a move that Harvard said would be an unlawful misuse of the US tax code.Robert N Proctor, a historian at Stanford University, said Trump was leading “a libertarian right-wing assault on the scientific enterprise” that had been years in the making. “We could well see a reverse brain drain ,” he said. “It’s not just to Europe, but scholars are moving to Canada and Asia as well.”Meredith Whittaker, president of encrypted messaging app Signal, declined to comment on geopolitical disputes, but added it was inevitable top talent would gravitate to welcoming jurisdictions.“I think researchers, people whose lives, whose inquiry, whose obsessions are motivated by particular questions, particular fields, who exist in a community of intellectual practice, will always be attracted to places where the ground is fertile for that work, where they’re not threatened, and where their research isn’t hampered or perverted.”","The European Union and France announced half a billion euros worth of incentives to lure scientists to the continent.

Talks with China on, signals Trump





President Trump has suggested that his administration may strike trade deals with some countries as early as this week, offering the prospect of relief for trading partners seeking to avoid higher US import duties. ""It could very well be,"" Trump told reporters Sunday when asked if any trade agreements were coming this week. He didn't specify any country. ""We're negotiating with many countries, but at the end of this, I'll set my own deals - because I set the deal, they don't set the deal,"" he said.

Former vice president Kamala Harris was spotted at New York's hotspot on Sunday night as she went on a dinner date with husband Doug Emhoff at The Polo Bar in Midtown Manhattan. What started a row over this was the huge entourage of policemen who were on security duty for the former VP and the former second husband. Apart from 25 secret Service agents, there were NYPD officers either flanking the couple or waiting outside where four bulletproof cars and three additional SUVs were stationed.""Secret Service is fine; NYPD, no. NYPD needs to protect the people, we don't have enough of them,"" Republican NYC mayoral candidate Curtis Silwa said to DailyMail.com. ""She's going to a bar to enjoy herself, and she's got an army of security paid for by us, not her.""As a former vice president, Harris and her family are entitled to federally funded protection for about six months after leaving office.Silwa said the Secret Service was doing its job, but the heavy police presence should have been paid by the couple for their night out. ""It's unbelievable... there were probably more security officers between the feds and the NYPD than there were patrons inside,"" Silwa said.The Polo Bar is known for its exorbitant prices and also for its exclusivity.The jaunt which was opened 10 years ago as part of Ralph Lauren's foray into hospitality is a favorite among the celebrities.
