Attacker tried to escape after attack, caught by hosp staff

CHENNAI: The head of the oncology department at state-run Kalaignar Centenary Super-Specialty Hospital was stabbed multiple times Wednesday in his consultation room by a man allegedly dissatisfied with the treatment his mother was receiving.Dr Balaji Jaganathan suffered serious wounds to his scalp, head, neck, back, and ear. He was rushed into emergency surgery. “His condition is stable. He will be monitored in ICU by a team of doctors,” said hospital director Dr L Parthasarathy.The attack triggered protests by doctors and paramedics at the hospital and other medical facilities. The Service Doctors and Post Graduates Association demanded swift action against the attacker, and called for stronger security and a central law to protect medical staff from violence. A flash strike hit services, except for emergencies.This happened amid growing demands by doctors across India for better protection and legal safeguards against violence, especially after the rape-murder of a resident doctor in Kolkata’s RG Kar Medical College on Aug 9. Jaganathan’s attacker, identified as M Vignesh, was caught by hospital staff while attempting to flee. The automobile engineering diploma-holder was later remanded in judicial custody.Police said his mother Prema Manoharan was an advanced-stage cancer patient who had received six rounds of chemotherapy and palliative care at the hospital. Her condition worsened at home three days ago. According to Parthasarathy, the attacker had visited the hospital a day before the attack, where he quarrelled with oncologist Jaganathan.On Wednesday, Vignesh took an outpatient slip, waited for his turn and once inside the doctor’s consultation room, locked the door and launched a vicious attack with a kitchen knife. He discarded the bloodstained knife on the hospital premises and attempted to escape.Opposition parties condemned the assault, while criticising the DMK-led govt’s handling of law and order in the state and its “failure” in protecting doctors in medical facilities. In response, deputy chief minister Udhayanidhi Stalin visited the hospital and assured its staff and the medical community that the govt would take stringent action against the attacker.Chennai police commissioner A Arun also visited the hospital and announced that security would be increased. State health minister Ma Subramanian reaffirmed govt’s commitment to safety, noting recent measures to improve hospital security such as the installation of CCTV cameras at over 2,000 primary health centres across Tamil Nadu in recent months.","Dr Balaji Jaganathan suffered serious wounds to his scalp, head, neck, back, and ear.

Mom of 3 was brutally tortured before being set ablaze in Manipur: Autopsy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mom-of-3-was-brutally-tortured-before-being-set-ablaze-in-manipur-autopsy/articleshow/115273837.cms,"Manipur violence (File photo)

Autopsy findings suggestive of “third-degree” torture using nails and burns inflicted while the victim was alive accentuated on Wednesday the horror of a 31-year-old mother of three being allegedly raped before being burned to death by armed intruders inside her village home in Manipur’s Jiribam on Nov 7, leading to a sequence of other violent happenings in the district since.The autopsy at Silchar Medical College in neighbouring Assam couldn’t ascertain if the woman, a tribal resident of the Zairawn village, was sexually assaulted before being killed as her charred body ruled out any chance of doctors collecting a vaginal smear.The FIR registered at Jiribam quotes her husband as saying she was raped before being “brutally killed” in “our residence”. The perpetrators, who plundered and set 17 homes ablaze in Zairawn that night, are suspected to be members of a valley-based outfit.Manipur woman’s body 99% burnt, even bones charred: ReportThe autopsy report mentions “a wound in the back of right thigh” and a “metallic nail embedded in the medial aspect of left thigh”. The body was found to have 99% burns, with even the bone fragments charred. “The right upper limb, parts of both lower limbs, and the facial structure are missing,” the report notes.Most of the other details are too graphic to reproduce, indicative of the torture and pain the woman was subjected to before flames enveloped her along with the home she, her husband and children lived in. It isn’t clear where the victim’s husband and children were when the assailants arrived.Kuki-Zo organisations have condemned the woman’s killing as “barbaric”, with tempers flaring over security agencies being unable to identify the killers.The Indigenous Tribes Advocacy Committee of Pherzawl and Jiribam requested central intervention to safeguard the Kuki-Zomi-Hmar people of the twin tribal-dominant districts. The Indigenous Tribal Leaders’ Forum , a conglomerate of tribal communities of Churachandpur, warned of more turmoil if the assailants weren’t arrested.The woman’s alleged rape and the manner of her killing harks back to the worst of Manipur’s theatre of violence since May last year, including instances of women being stripped, paraded naked, gang-raped and killed in the initial weeks of the still-raging ethnic strife. The hill-valley divide caused by acts of violence by both sides continues to keep hundreds of displaced families confined to relief shelters in Jiribam and elsewhere in the state.Manipur Police said they took the tribal woman’s charred remains to Silchar, less than 50km from Jiribam, instead of Imphal for autopsy because it was purportedly “very much inconvenient to transport the body by road via NH-37 due to ongoing ethnic crisis”.","Mother of three, 31, allegedly raped before being burned to death in Manipur.

GUWAHATI: An escalation of violence in Manipur has prompted MHA to despatch 2,500-odd additional central paramilitary personnel to the state, most of them for deployment in Jiribam, a relatively new flashpoint of the ethnic stir that has reported 13 fatalities since Nov 7.The state, which has witnessed bloodletting on both sides of the hill-valley divide over the past 19 months, will now have a combined deployment of 218 companies of central armed police forces (CAPF), constituting over 29,000 personnel. The Army and Assam Rifles form another ring of security.As per MHA directive issued Tuesday, 15 of 20 companies of reinforcements comprise CRPF units repositioned from Assam. The other five companies are of BSF transferred from Tripura.“The state govt of Manipur is instructed to formulate the detailed deployment plan, in consultation with the respective CAPFs,” the order states. “The ministry anticipates swift normalisation of the situation and has sanctioned this deployment to maintain law and order until the month-end.”The updated CAPF deployment in the state stands at 115 CRPF companies, eight from RAF, 84 of BSF, five ITBP units and six from SSB. The initial contingent of approximately 1,200 personnel is expected to reach Imphal late Wednesday, officials said.Lt Gen Abhijit Pendharkar, GOC, Army’s 3rd Corps, reviewed “operational preparedness” during an inspection of the Red Shield Division based in Leimakhong.Jiribam has been on the boil since June, culminating in a mother of three being allegedly raped before being burned to death on Nov 7. Last Monday, 10 “armed militants” were killed in a purported CRPF-police counteroffensive after they attacked two security posts. The bodies of two elderly residents of a shelter for the displaced were found Tuesday in the vicinity of the gunfight site — one with bullet wounds and the other charred.

AIZWAL/SILCHAR: Unrest over 10 “armed militants” being gunned down by security forces in Manipur’s Jiribam on Nov 11 spread to neighbouring south Assam and Mizoram Wednesday as tribal organisations milled outside Silchar Medical College to question the “prolonged autopsy process”, while Mizo National Front (MNF) — an former NDA ally — termed the casualties “extra-judicial killings”.SMC doctors completed autopsies on six of the 10 slain Hmar “militants” by Tuesday evening and the scheduled the rest for the following day, sources said. As the hours ticked by Wednesday, the restiveness of tribal protesters awaiting the autopsy findings grew along with the size of the crowd.By evening, the protesters were raising slogans demanding that they be informed of what was happening. Cachar district SP Numal Mahatta sought to quell conspiracy theories, saying there was “no deliberate postponement” of autopsies.In Aizawl, MNF declared the 10 slain men as “fallen heroes”, mirroring claims by Kuki-Zo & Hmar outfits that a joint CRPF-police team killed “village volunteers” and passed them off as militants.“CRPF exhibited bias... Such actions risk exacerbating fragile situation in Manipur... If we survive, we will survive together, and if we die, we will ensure no one dies alone. We denounce CRPF’s actions, and its discriminatory behaviour,” MNF said. It added the bodies would be taken from Silchar to their homes “via Mizoram”.Amid the gathering storm, 13 civil rights organisations enforced a shutdown in Manipur valley — Imphal East & West, Thoubal, Kakching and Bishnupur — over the alleged abduction of three women and as many children from a shelter for displaced Meitei people in Jiribam.Armed men torched two trucks carrying supplies near Old Kaiphundai in Naga-dominant Tamenglong district, next to Jiribam.",Tribal organisations question the “prolonged autopsy process’ Mizo National Front (MNF) termed the casualties “extra-judicial killings” Doctors completed autopsies on six of the 10 slain Hmar “militants” by Tuesday evening and scheduled the rest for the following day.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115268943,imgsize-195936,width-400,resizemode-4/115268943.jpg"

KOLKATA: One should not “transgress the boundaries of decency and law”, Calcutta HC said Wednesday, adding that the width of freedom of expression neither gave anyone a “licence to abuse”, nor to make “irresponsible or motivated insinuations which can create violence in society”, although “the socio-democratic fabric of the country is elastic to accommodate unpopular views”.HC, however, refused to pass a gag order against a former BJP neta from airing her views, saying that would amount to “pre-censorship”.

NEW DELHI: SC on Wednesday told Ajit Pawar-led NCP, which has been allowed to use the prized ‘clock’ symbol for Maharashtra assembly elections subject to certain conditions, not to use Sharad Pawar’s pictures in its campaign and asked NCP functionaries to try to stand on their feet.It was a bitter verbal clash between senior advocate A M Singhvi, appearing for Pawar Sr, and senior advocate Balbir Singh, who appeared for Ajit-led NCP and told a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Ujjal Bhuyan that the party had scrupulously followed SC’s order in issuing disclaimer advertisements in media about the ‘clock symbol’ being sub judice.Singhvi repeatedly complained that a functionary of Ajit-led NCP, MLC Amol Mitkari, had posted pictures of Pawar Sr on X (formerly Twitter), and alleged that the attempt was to show that the Pawars were still united as a family and that there was no rift in order to create confusion in the minds of voters.“Ajit Pawar-led NCP can’t piggyback on Sharad Pawar’s goodwill in blatant violation of SC orders,” Singhvi said. Maharashtra votes on Nov 20.The bench doubted whether rural voters would be affected by an X post, which is generally for consumption of urban population. “Do you think people of Maharashtra do not know that the two leaders have parted ways and gone in opposite directions?” the bench said and wanted to know from Singhvi the assembly seats in which these two parties are in direct contest.Singhvi said they were in direct contest in 36 seats, but the attempt was to create confusion in all 288 seats to benefit the rival coalition in which Ajit’s NCP was a partner.Could an X post cause confusion when disclaimers had been published virtually in all newspapers, the bench wondered.To determine the veracity of the allegations of violations by Ajit Pawar-NCP, a fact-finding committee must be constituted, it said.Listing further hearing for Nov 19, a day before the polls, the bench sought clarification from Ajit’s party on a certain post using Pawar Sr’s photo and said: “You have published disclaimers. But what Singhvi is saying is right. Whether it is an old or recent photo of Sharad Pawar, ask your functionaries not to use any of his photos.”“Tell your party functionaries that they will not use old or new video clips or use photographs of Sharad Pawar with whom your party is having ideological differences.

On June 27, district administration in Bareilly bulldozed a builder’s 12-room bungalow, reducing the structure and his children’s and grandchildren’s belongings to rubble for his alleged involvement in a gunfight. Days later, the houses of seven families in next door Moradabad were razed after a man was accused of orchestrating a dacoity and kidnapping . Today, both families are forced to live wretched lives. SC’s strictures against “bulldozer justice” may have come just a tad too late for many such families across India.Builder Rajiv Rana’s granddaughter, Avantika, clung to her mother that day as bulldozers in Bareilly inched closer, drowning out the sounds of daily life. “I was six months pregnant, preparing a meal, and my mother-in-law was helping Avantika get ready for school when officials arrived, shouting our house was illegal and had to be demolished,” said Rana’s daughter-in-law, Maalu Singh.By the end of the day, the three-storey home was gone, leaving Maalu and her husband Ashish burdened not just with EMIs as they sat cross-legged on the rubble of their former house, but frantically calling up relatives for help and shelter. When the house was destroyed, there were toys and books of the children inside, Ashish said.In Moradabad, a similar story played out. Muslim Hussain, a 25-year-old carpenter, was accused of enlisting professional criminals to carry out a dacoity at the home of his married lover. That set off a chain of devastating consequences. Not only was Hussain’s house demolished, but seven homes belonging to his relatives were also razed by the district administration.“That happened on June 30,” Hussain’s relative said. “We couldn’t explain anything to anyone. Why were we punished? Our houses were flattened with all the valuables inside. Our families now live with great difficulties, and some of the children have stopped studying. All for one person’s alleged crime. Where is the justice in this?”Families left in the cold spoke to TOI not just about the trauma of seeing houses — often built brick by brick by their fathers and grandfathers — turn to dust, but also the discomfort that displacement brought and the shame that followed. One of them said, “We had relatives but no one rich or kind enough to accept us in their houses. We finally had to leave our native town. Our children either changed schools or had to leave studies. The old and the ailing in the family lost the touch of local doctors.”In July this year, authorities, once again in Bareilly, demolished 14 houses and arrested 58 individuals after a clash during Muharram processions in UP’s Gausganj village led to a small riot.Among houses razed for Muharram violence, one belonged to mason Mustaq Ali, despite no case against him. His wife said, “We had saved money for our daughter’s marriage. Everything’s lost.”",Houses of seven families in next door Moradabad were razed after a man was accused of orchestrating a dacoity and kidnapping.

SRINAGAR: A student from south Kashmir’s Kulgam district, currently pursuing his MSc in Lab Science, was detained by Counter-Intelligence Kashmir (CIK) Wednesday for allegedly misusing social media to propagate radical, anti-national views and instigate public sentiment against Govt of India. He allegedly “glamorized” terrorism on his social media handles and was himself about to pick up arms, the CIK said in a statement.Accused Bhat Navidul Ali, a resident of Tazipora-Mohammadpora in Kulgam, had been in “constant touch with some cyber/virtual entities radicalising and motivating youth to join terrorism and terrorist ranks”, the statement said.Apart from glorifying terrorism in J&K, Bhat “also consumes the radical content available on the internet” and it was learnt that he was “about to join terrorist ranks”, CIK stated. On receiving this information, a special CIK team detained him for questioning. His parents and neighbours were also called for counselling, the statement said.“An appeal is made to the youth of Kashmir Valley to refrain from involving in such illegal activities and parents are advised to keep a close watch upon their wards so that the youth does not fall into the trap of such enticements,” the statement added.","Bhat Navidul Ali, a student from south Kashmir’s Kulgam district, was detained by Counter-Intelligence Kashmir (CIK) He allegedly “glamorized” terrorism on his social media handles and was himself about to pick up arms.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115267634,imgsize-12914,width-400,resizemode-4/115267634.jpg"
Donald Trump hints at 3rd term in White House in speech to GOP lawmakers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-hints-at-3rd-term-in-white-house-in-speech-to-gop-lawmakers/articleshow/115263491.cms,"What the US constitution says

Section 1: ""No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once"".

Section 2: ""This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States within seven years from the date of its submission to the States by the Congress"".

Implications for a third term

Trump's return to White House

US President-elect Donald Trump suggested on Wednesday that he could be open to a constitution-breaking third term in office, in remarks made to House Republicans ahead of the start of his second term.""I suspect I won't be running again unless you say, 'He's good, we got to figure something else,'"" Trump provocatively told his audience in a downtown Washington hotel, drawing some laughter from supporters.Back in Washington for the first time since his election victory, Trump told the GOP lawmakers, “It’s nice to win.”Trump received a standing ovation from House Republicans, many of whom took cellphone videos of him as ran through their party's victories up and down the ballot, in what would be, under the constitutional limits, his final presidential election.The US Constitution, specifically the 22nd Amendment, establishes clear limitations on the number of terms a president can serve. Ratified in 1951, the amendment states:This amendment was largely a response to Franklin D. Roosevelt's unprecedented four terms in office, which raised concerns about prolonged executive power. The framers intended to prevent any future president from serving more than two elected terms, thereby ensuring a rotation in leadership and avoiding any potential for an ""elective monarchy"".Given this constitutional framework, a president who has already been elected twice is legally prohibited from running for a third term. For instance, Donald Trump, who has been elected for his second term in 2024, cannot seek re-election in 2028 due to this restriction.The Republican returned to Washington after defeating his Democrat rival Kamala Harris.After his speech to GOP lawmakers, Trump made his way to the White House.President Joe Biden welcomed Trump to the White House where both leaders assured there would be a ""peaceful transition of power"".The current president inviting the president-elect has been customary practice to ensure peaceful handoff of power. However, this was not done by Trump four years agon when he lost to the Democrats.Earlier in 2016, Trump met President Barack Obama in the Oval Office after his victory when he defeated Hillary Clinton, describing it as ""a great honour."" However, he subsequently resumed criticising Obama, including unsubstantiated allegations of campaign surveillance.Trump contested his 2020 defeat to Biden, persistently making unfounded claims about voter fraud. He neither invited then President-elect Biden to the White House nor attended his inauguration - the first such absence since Andrew Johnson missed Ulysses S Grant's ceremony 155 years ago.Biden however pledged full cooperation for a smooth transition to Trump's administration, despite having campaigned extensively against Trump, portraying him as a threat to democratic values.","The US Constitution, specifically the 22nd Amendment, establishes clear limitations on the number of terms a president can serve.

Matt Gaetz Named Attorney General by Donald Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-picks-firebrand-congressman-matt-gaetz-for-attorney-general/articleshow/115273833.cms,"US President-elect Donald Trump has selected representative Matt Gaetz , the controversial Florida Republican , as his attorney general nominee . This bold choice signals Trump's intention to place a loyal supporter in charge of the justice department as he pursues accountability against his prosecutors.The selection demonstrates Trump's preference for a steadfast advocate who would align with his directives, unlike his previous confirmed attorney general, Bill Barr, who challenged Trump's election claims in 2020.Gaetz's potential confirmation faces significant hurdles in the Senate due to widespread opposition from both parties. At 42, Gaetz's potential elevation to this crucial Cabinet position would mark a significant shift in his career trajectory, paralleling Trump's own political resurgence.Notably, Gaetz was under federal investigation for sex trafficking until 2023, when the Biden administration 's justice department declined prosecution. He is currently facing an ongoing House ethics committee investigation.Trump overlooked several traditional candidates for the position, including Utah senator Mike Lee, who actively sought the role. The announcement came via Truth Social, where Trump indicated that Gaetz would address ""systemic corruption at DOJ"" and restore the department's focus on crime prevention.Trump praised Gaetz, who comes from an influential Florida political family, as a ""gifted and tenacious attorney."" He outlined priorities for Gaetz, including investigating the ""Russia Hoax"" and addressing alleged government corruption and weaponisation.Should the Senate confirm Gaetz, one of Congress's most vocal critics of the justice department and FBI would lead these organisations. His controversial status in Congress and frequent conflicts with Republican leadership, particularly former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, raise questions about potential Republican opposition to his nomination.Senator John Cornyn, republican of Texas, acknowledged limited familiarity with Gaetz beyond his public image. Regarding Gaetz's confirmation prospects, along with Tulsi Gabbard 's nomination for director of national intelligence, Cornyn remained noncommittal.North Carolina republican senator Thom Tillis expressed greater reservations, noting Gaetz's challenging path ahead. ""There's obviously been a lot of disagreements between members of the Senate and Mr. Gaetz,"" he said, emphasising the importance of relationship management.","US President-elect Donald Trump has selected representative Matt Gaetz as his attorney general nominee.

Why Charlie Kirk?



Appointments made so far



As Donald Trump is picking his staff one Truth Social post a day, a lot is going on behind the scenes with his transition team adopting a very different approach this time. Everything is taking place mostly out of the public view at Mar-a-Lago where Trump and his team huddle with a coterie of players. Elon Musk was there almost every day last week but Elon is not the only one -- there are key players like Donald Trump Jr, RFK Jr, Tulsi Gabbard, Vivek Ramaswamy , Charlie Kirk and then a random assortment of advisers.“There’s a lot of different factions. There’s a lot of people calling Trump. There’s a lot of people who thought one thing was set in stone and are finding out that’s not the case, and the chessboard is going to be shuffled a lot in the coming weeks,” said one person with knowledge of the transition.According to Politico, Trump and his transition advisers are reviewing candidates from a room at Mar-a-Lago. The room has long tables and a few televisions where Trump is being shown media clips and bios of the candidates.""Trump's transition co-chairs are Lutnick and Linda McMahon, but there are Elon Musk, Vice President-elect JD Vance, Donald Trump Jr, Tulsi Gabbard, Kennedy. There’s also a rotating cast of conservative influencers like Charlie Kirk and Vivek Ramaswamy, according to four people with knowledge of the meetings,"" Politico reported.Trump's personal friend Steve Witkoff is there and then Trump is dialing up friend and allies seeking their opinions.It was Trump Jr who shot down any discussion of Mike Pompeo or Nikki Haley for any official roles as he made it clear that his father would only take loyalists as his staff.Kirk has long been friends with Trump Jr working with him during the 2016 campaign. ""Trump called Kirk on Wednesday after his victory. And in the last week Kirk weighed in publicly in favor of two of Trump’s staffing picks before they were announced: Wiles for chief of staff and Stephen Miller for deputy chief of staff,"" the Politico report said.White House Chief of Staff: Susie WilesDeputy chief of staff for policy: Stephen MillerBorder Czar: Tom HomanNational security adviser: Mike WaltzHomeland Security secretary pick: Kristi NoemUnited National Ambassador: Elise StefanikEnvironmental Protection Agency director: Lee ZeldinSecretary of State: Marco RubioAmbassador to Israel: Mike Huckabee.","Donald Trump Jr. shot down any discussion of Mike Pompeo or Nikki Haley for any official roles as he made it clear that his father would only take loyalists as his staff.

Presidential aspirations and party switch

Prominence in Trump's circle

Military service and intelligence background

Intelligence sector reform plans

US President-elect Donald Trump selected Tulsi Gabbard , an ex-Democratic congresswoman turned staunch supporter, as director of national intelligence on Wednesday. Gabbard , who holds the rank of lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve and has combat experience in Iraq, has consistently challenged established foreign policy views.Her selection reflects Trump's preference for appointing foreign policy sceptics who question American military interventions abroad.Trump's official announcement praised Gabbard's ""fearless spirit"" and her potential contribution to intelligence agencies , emphasising ""peace through strength."" The announcement noted her transition from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party , saying she switched ""because of President Trump's leadership and how he has been able to transform the Republican Party, bringing it back to the party of the people and the party of peace.""Roger Stone, Trump's long-time associate who received a presidential pardon in 2020, initially shared the news on his X account, publishing the statement he claimed came directly from Trump.If confirmed, Gabbard would work alongside John Ratcliffe, Trump's CIA director nominee, as a principal intelligence adviser to the White House. Her responsibilities would include managing 18 intelligence organisations and coordinating the President's Daily Brief, a crucial morning intelligence summary.At 43, Gabbard was born in American Samoa and raised in Hawaii, with a brief period in the Philippines. Her political career began at 21 in Hawaii's House of Representatives, interrupted by her National Guard deployment to Iraq.As the first Hindu member of the House, she took her oath on the ""Bhagavad Gita"". She also holds the distinction of being the first American Samoan in Congress. During her four terms, she notably challenged her party's leadership. Her early backing of senator Bernie Sanders' 2016 campaign elevated her national profile amongst progressives.Her family includes her spouse, cinematographer Abraham Williams, and her father, Mike Gabbard, a state senator who transitioned from Republican to Democrat.Her 2020 Democratic presidential campaign emphasised a progressive agenda and opposition to American military interventions. She highlighted how US Middle Eastern conflicts had destabilised the region and compromised American safety. During the primaries, she notably confronted then-senator Kamala Harris about her prosecutorial record.After withdrawing and supporting Biden's candidacy, she later left the Democratic Party, criticising it as controlled by ""an elitist cabal of warmongers"" and ""woke"" ideologues. She subsequently aligned with Republicans, joined Fox News, and launched a podcast.""Today's Democratic Party is unrecognisable from the party I joined 20 years ago,"" she said regarding her departure.Her endorsement of Trump this year significantly boosted her standing among his supporters. Frequently appearing with Robert F Kennedy Jr, Gabbard exemplified Trump's claimed cross-party appeal. She assisted Trump's debate preparation against Harris and publicly announced her Republican Party membership at a North Carolina rally in October, describing the Democratic Party as ""completely unrecognizable"".Trump has included both Gabbard and Kennedy in his transition team, potentially influencing staffing and policy decisions in a future administration.Gabbard's military career spans over twenty years in the Army National Guard, including deployments to Iraq and Kuwait. She received recognition with a Combat Medical Badge in 2005 for service during Operation Iraqi Freedom III, as confirmed by the Hawaii National Guard.Unlike her predecessors, she lacks senior government experience, though she served two years on the House Homeland Security Committee.The current director, Avril Haines, confirmed in 2021, brought extensive national security and intelligence experience and made history as the first female director.Trump intends to restructure intelligence services, which he views with scepticism. He attributes past challenges to intelligence agencies' alleged interference with his previous administration and campaigns.He frequently references the ""deep state"", describing career civil servants whom he considers insufficiently loyal. ""We will clean out all of the corrupt actors in our national security and intelligence apparatus, and there are plenty of them,"" Trump declared in 2023, outlining second-term priorities.The director's role, established in 2004 post-9/11, aims to enhance interagency cooperation and prevent intelligence failures. The office has been crucial in identifying and exposing disinformation from Russia, China, and Iran regarding voting and democracy before recent elections. Its responsibilities extend to cybersecurity, counterterrorism, and counterespionage","Tulsi Gabbard is the first Hindu member of the House of Representatives.

Olson's death was announced by his law firm, Gibson Dunn , where he had worked since 1965. The cause of death was not shared.Olson was a key figure in significant legal battles. He successfully represented George W. Bush in the 2000 Florida election dispute that reached the Supreme Court. He served as U.S. Solicitor General under President Bush from 2001 to 2004.One of Olson's most impactful cases involved representing same-sex couples seeking the right to marry in California. This case went against the views of many of his fellow conservatives. During his closing argument, Olson stated: ""It is the right of individuals, not an indulgence to be dispensed by the state. The right to marry, to choose to marry, has never been tied to procreation."" The case ultimately led to the legalization of same-sex marriage nationwide.Olson argued 65 cases before the Supreme Court throughout his career, leaving a lasting impact on American law.""Even in a town full of lawyers, Ted's career as a litigator was particularly prolific,"" said Mitch McConnell, the longtime Senate Republican leader. ""More importantly, I count myself among so many in Washington who knew Ted as a good and decent man.""Bush made Olson his solicitor general, a post the lawyer held from 2001 to 2004. Olson had previously served in the Justice Department as an assistant attorney general during President Ronald Reagan's first term in the early 1980s.""They weren't just little cases,"" said Theodore Boutrous, a partner at the law firm who worked with Olson for 37 years. ""Many of them were big, blockbuster caes that helped shape our society.""Those included the Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, a 2010 case that eliminated many limits on political giving, and a successful challenge to the Trump administration's decision to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.""He's the greatest lawyer I've ever worked with or seen in action,"" said Boutrous, who worked so closely with Olson that they were known at Gibson Dunn as ""the two Teds."" ""He was an entertaining and forceful advocate who could go toe-to-toe with the Supreme Court justices in a way few lawyers could. They respected him so much.""One of Olson's most prominent cases put him at odds with many fellow conservatives. After California adopted a ban on same-sex marriage in 2008, Olson joined forces with former adversary David Boies, who had represented Democrat Al Gore in the presidential election case, to represent California couples seeking the right to marry.During closing arguments, Olson contended that tradition or fears of harm to heterosexual unions were legally insufficient grounds to discriminate against same-sex couples.A federal judge in California ruled in 2010 that the state's ban violated the U.S. Constitution. The U.S. Supreme Court let that decision stand in 2013.""This is the most important thing I've ever done, as an attorney or a person,"" Olson later said in a documentary film about the marriage case.He told The Associated Press in 2014 that the marriage case was important because it ""involves tens of thousands of people in California, but really millions of people throughout the United States and beyond that to the world.""His decision to join the case added a prominent conservative voice to the rapidly shifting views on same-sex marriage across the country.Boies remembered Olson as a giant in legal circles who ""left the law, our country, and each of us better than he found us. Few people are a hero to those that know them well. Ted was a hero to those who knew him best.""Olson's personal life also intersected tragically with the nation's history when his third wife, well-known conservative legal analyst Barbara Olson, died on Sept. 11, 2001. She was a passenger on American Airlines Flight 77, which crashed into the Pentagon.In recent years, his other high profile clients have included quarterback Tom Brady during the ""Deflategate"" scandal of 2016 and technology company Apple in a legal battle with the FBI over unlocking the phone of a shooter who killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California, in 2015.The range of his career and his statute on the national stage were unmatched, said Barbara Becker, managing partner of Gibson Dunn.""Ted was a titan of the legal profession and one of the most extraordinary and eloquent advocates of our time,"" Becker said in a statement.",Olson was a key figure in significant legal battles. He successfully represented George W. Bush in the 2000 Florida election dispute. He served as U.S. Solicitor General under President Bush from 2001 to 2004.

Despite Trump's team emphasising the importance of her attendance following Jill Biden's invitation, her office cited a book-related scheduling conflict. This was confirmed on X Wednesday morning.This decision suggests that Trump, who previously redefined the role during her first term, is establishing her independence early for her potential second tenure.""I'm not anxious because this time is different. I have much more experience and much more knowledge. I was in the White House before. When you go in, you know exactly what to expect,"" Trump said in a recent Fox News interview whilst promoting her memoir.Sources familiar with the situation indicate she plans to divide her time primarily between New York City and Palm Beach, Florida, rather than Washington, though they affirm she will maintain her first lady duties and attend significant events. Donald Trump is expected to continue his pattern of spending winter weekends at Mar-a-Lago and summer weekends at his Bedminster, New Jersey golf club. The Bidens have similarly split their time between Washington and Delaware, though maintaining the White House as their primary weekday residence.Sources indicate that Melania Trump has established a social circle in Florida over the past four years and is likely to maintain these connections.Following the 2016 election, she delayed her White House move until after her son Barron, then 10, completed his school year. Barron, now 18, attends New York University.Sources suggest she will spend considerable time at Trump Tower in New York to be near Barron.

In a viral clip from his appearance on the Shawn Ryan Show podcast, he argued that physical differences between men and women, such as bone density and muscle strength, create challenges in meeting the demands of combat.Hegseth said, “Everything about men and women serving together makes the situation more complicated. And complication in combat means casualties are worse.”""Everybody knows between bone density and lung capacity and muscle strength. Men and women are just different. And if there's some, you know, hard charging female that meets that standard, great, cool. Join the infantry battalion. But that is not what's happened,"" he added.Hegseth, who was a former Fox News host, criticised the military’s evolving standards, claiming that they are increasingly being tailored to integrate women into traditionally male-dominated roles. “They’re not getting tougher. If they were lowering the standard to become a Navy SEAL just to let women in, that’s going to change the capabilities and ethos of the Navy SEALs,” he argued. Hegseth suggested that, in response to political pressure, standards are subtly being relaxed to encourage female participation.""They're going to change the standards. They're going to push for quotas. We have numerous quotes in the book of no, no, these standards aren't changing. They're just evolving. They're just evolving to meet the needs of today. They're not getting tougher, I tell you that,"" he said.""And so I'm surprised there hasn't been more blowback on that already in the book, because I'm straight up just saying we should not have women in combat roles ,"" Trump's defence secretary pick added.Beyond his stance on combat roles, Hegseth has frequently criticised what he perceives as “woke” policies, particularly diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. He has called for a rollback of these programs within the Pentagon, alleging they weaken the military by diverting focus from merit and operational capability. On the same podcast, he insisted that military leadership should be reshaped, advocating for the dismissal of senior officers involved in DEI policies.Trump has described Hegseth as “tough, smart, and a true believer in America First,” emphasising that Hegseth’s views reflect an intention to overhaul military culture and reinstate traditional, merit-based standards . Known for his hard-line positions, Hegseth previously advocated for President Trump to pardon soldiers convicted of war crimes and has expressed support for redefining the department of defense as the “War Department.”","Pete Hegseth, a former Fox News host, is Donald Trump's pick for defence secretary.

"Pete Hegseth: Trump picks tattooed, 44-year-old MAGA supporter and Fox News host as defence secretary",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-picks-tattooed-44-year-old-maga-supporter-and-fox-news-host-as-defence-secretary/articleshow/115264746.cms,"US President-elect Donald Trump and Pete Hegseth

TOI Correspondent from Washington:

US President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday named a heavily-tattooed mid-level ex-soldier turned Fox News host Pete Hegseth as the in-coming defence secretary, as he continued to choose nominees from the MAGA right field for top jobs in his incoming administration.Trump also named John Ratcliffe, a former Texas congressman and Director of National Intelligence (DNI) in during his first term, as CIA Director , and former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee to serve as the US ambassador to Israel.Hegseth and Ratcliffe have a strong anti-China orientation, and Huckabee is strongly pro-Israel to the extent he supports its claim over the entire West Bank which forms a large part of Palestine.But it is Trump's choice of 44-year-old Hegseth as defence secretary that jolted the capital, where the job has typically gone to traditional establishment veterans with deep expertise in military and strategic matters, including during his first term. He selected a four-star general, James Mattis and an Army secretary, Mark Esper, to lead the Pentagon. Mattis resigned and Esper was later fired, two casualties amid a heavy turnover during the Trump One administration.Hegseth, a relative lightweight, is a fire-brand provocateur who served combat tours in Afghanistan and Iraq as a captain and platoon leader, before cycling through think-tanks and advocacy groups, and finally becoming a Fox News host.In fact, Trump critics noted that the only reason Hegseth is being tapped to be defence secretary is ""because he's on Fox News, and that's what Donald Trump picks are based on."" Among several controversial remarks he has made in recent times is calling for the firing of so-called ""woke generals"" and opposing combat roles for women in the military.He is also heavily tattooed, bearing several across his arms and chest, including one of the Jerusalem cross, which has perceived links to Christian nationalism. One tattoo emblazoned across his arm says ""We The People"" and on his bicep is the phrase ""Deus Vult"" -- God Willing, a battlecry for Christians during the First Crusade.But it is Hegseth's remarks on China that will stir interest in capitals looking forward to Trump's pledge of no wars. In one fiery podcast, he spoke of Washington being oblivious to China’s growing power while Beijing was explicitly building a military to defeat the United States. “The Pentagon runs perfect war game simulations. We lose every time to China… They’re building an army…We have our heads up our asses,” he said.The choice of Hegseth for Defence and Ratcliffe for CIA also set at rest rampant speculation -- and lobbying by their supporters -- that former Democratic lawmaker turned Trump supporter Tulsi Gabbard, and MAGA acolyte Kash Patel were respectively in line for the two jobs.","Pete Hegseth is a heavily-tattooed mid-level ex-soldier turned Fox News host.

China pushing to deploy its own security staff to protect citizens in Pak: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/china-pushing-to-deploy-its-own-security-staff-to-protect-citizens-in-pak-report/articleshow/115235972.cms,"File photo

Beijing is pushing Pakistan to allow its own security staff to provide protection to thousands of Chinese citizens working in the South Asian nation, during talks after a car bombing in Karachi that was seen as a major security breach, sources said.Last month’s airport bombing in the southern port city that killed two Chinese engineers returning to work on a project after a holiday in Thailand was the latest in a string of attacks on Beijing’s interests in Pakistan. The attacks, and Islamabad’s failure to deter them, have angered China, which has pushed Pakistan to begin formal negotiations for a joint security management system .Reuters spoke to five Pakistani security and govt sources with direct knowledge of the previously unreported negotiations, and reviewed a written proposal sent by Beijing to Islamabad. “They (Chinese) want to bring in their own security,” said one official, who sat in on a recent meeting, adding that Pa kistan had not so far agreed to such a step.A written proposal sent to Islamabad by Beijing, and forwarded to Pakistani security agencies for review, mentioned a clause allowing the dispatching of security agencies and military forces into each others’ territory to assist in counter-terrorism missions and conduct joint strikes. The dispatching would be done after discussions, but Pakistani agencies were averse to the proposal, one official said.Neither Beijing nor Islama bad confirmed the talks officially. The source, and two other officials, said there was a consensus on setting up a joint security management system, and that Pakistan was amenable to Chinese officials sitting in on security meetings and co-ordination. But there was no agreement on their participating in security arrangements on the ground. The first official said Pakistan had asked China for help in improving its intelligence and surveillance capabilities instead of direct involvement.The nature of the Karachi bombing has angered Beijing: A pick-up truck rigged with nearly 100 kg of explosives waited unchecked for 40 minutes near the outermost security cordon of the heavily guarded airport before its driver rammed it into the vehicle carrying Chinese engineers, officials said. “It was agrave security breach,” admitted one of the officials investigating the blast. Investigators believe the attackers had “inside help” in securing details of the itinerary and route.","Beijing is pushing Pakistan to allow its own security staff to provide protection to thousands of Chinese citizens working in the South Asian nation.

'Army chief for life': How the 'establishment' is tightening its grip on elected government in Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/army-chief-for-life-how-the-establishment-is-tightening-its-grip-on-elected-government-in-pakistan/articleshow/115173618.cms,"Implication of the amendment

The 'establishment'



Not the first time

More changes



The recent amendment to the Pakistan Army Act, which extends the tenure of the Chief of Army Staff (COAS) from three to five years, has sparked significant debate and concern regarding the implications for civil-military relations in Pakistan .This legislative change, hastily approved by the ruling coalition led by PM Shehbaz Sharif's PML-N, not only lengthens the term of the army chief but also removes the retirement age limit for four-star generals, effectively allowing military leaders to remain in power indefinitely.The amendment allows the current COAS, General Asim Munir , who was appointed in November 2022 and was set to retire in 2025, to potentially serve until 2027 or longer if further extensions are granted. This change is seen as a continuation of a trend where military leaders have managed to extend their tenures beyond traditional limits.The amendment was moved by defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif and received majority support despite strong opposition protests from the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, led by former PM Imran Khan.The PTI lawmakers criticised the expedited process of passing such crucial legislation without adequate debate, arguing that it undermines democratic principles in a country already grappling with political instabilityThe removal of the retirement age limit for the army chief raises critical concerns about the balance of power between civilian governance and military authority in Pakistan.Critics argue that this move consolidates military power at a time when civilian institutions are already perceived as weak. The ability for an army chief to remain in power indefinitely could lead to a scenario where military influence over political affairs becomes even more pronounced, effectively sidelining elected representatives.Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center, noted that such legislative actions transform the legislative into a ""rubber stamp"", thereby diminishing democratic governance.The Pakistan army has been a dominant force in the country's political landscape since its inception in 1947, often overshadowing elected governments.The military's involvement in politics began almost immediately, with its first significant intervention occurring in 1958 when General Muhammad Ayub Khan led a coup against the civilian government, citing corruption and inefficiency.Since that initial coup, the army has directly ruled the country for about 36 years, while also exerting considerable influence during periods of civilian rule.Major coups occurred under Ayub Khan (1958), Yahya Khan (1969), and Zia-ul-Haq (1977), each time justifying military rule as necessary for national stability.The military's rationale often centered around restoring order amid political chaos, which has led to a cycle of governance where elected officials frequently find themselves subordinate to military interests.The intertwining of military and political affairs has given rise to what analysts describe as the ""establishment"" or ""deep state"", where the military operates behind the scenes to influence policy decisions even when not in direct control.This dynamic has allowed the army to maintain significant control over key areas such as foreign policy, security, and economic management. For instance, during recent political upheavals, including the ousting of former Prime Minister Imran Khan in 2022, the military played a crucial role in shaping political outcomes.Elected governments have often been compelled to align their policies with military interests.Political leaders are acutely aware that their tenure could be jeopardized by military intervention if they stray too far from the army's preferences. This has led to a pattern where civilian governments consult with military leaders on critical issues, particularly those involving national security and foreign relations. The recent amendments to extend the tenure of the Chief of Army Staff reflect this ongoing power dynamic, allowing military leadership to exert even greater influence over governance without the constraints of a retirement age.In defense of the amendments, government officials have argued that extending military tenures is essential for maintaining stability and continuity in Pakistan's security leadership amid regional tensions. They contend that allowing military chiefs to serve longer terms will enable them to address national security challenges without disruptions caused by frequent leadership changes.Supporters of the amendment also claim that aligning military leadership tenures with other constitutional offices—many of which have five-year terms—provides a rational framework for governance.The legislative change is not unprecedented in Pakistan's history.Previous army chiefs have also enjoyed extended tenures through similar amendments or political maneuvering.General Qamar Javed Bajwa had his term extended multiple times during his tenure from 2016 to 2022.The pattern of extending military leadership has become almost standard practice, raising questions about accountability and oversight within Pakistan's political system.Observers note that General Munir's potential extended tenure could mirror historical figures like General Zia-ul-Haq, whose prolonged rule led to widespread discontent among both military ranks and civilians due to perceived mismanagement and authoritarian practices.The removal of age limits and potential for indefinite extensions could lead to a scenario where future army chiefs similarly consolidate power.Moreover, there are concerns that these changes may pave the way for further legal amendments aimed at consolidating military power across other branches of government.For instance, recent discussions around increasing the number of Supreme Court judges could be interpreted as an attempt to ensure favorable judicial outcomes for military interests.","The Pakistan army has been a dominant force in the country's political landscape since its inception in 1947.

Users described difficulties connecting, with VPN Unlimited showing a peak of reported problems at around 6:15 pm and TunnelBear users noting connectivity issues into the evening.For many Pakistanis, VPNs are a vital tool for accessing blocked sites, including X (formerly Twitter), which has been restricted due to national security concerns.

In his message, Sharif wrote, ""Congratulations to President-elect Donald Trump on his historic victory for a second term! I look forward to working closely with the incoming administration to further strengthen and broaden the Pakistan-US partnership.” However, X attached a community note to the tweet, pointing out that Sharif himself had banned X in Pakistan and was likely using a VPN to access the platform, which is “unlawful under Pakistani law.”This community note intensified debates over VPN usage in the country, with some citizens arguing that restrictive internet policies compel even government officials to bypass their own regulations. Another note was attached to a subsequent tweet by Sharif, congratulating Pakistan’s cricket team.In February, X was banned in Pakistan, with authorities citing “national security concerns” and non-compliance with local laws as justification. Despite the restrictions, X remains a key platform for official statements from the government.Last August, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) announced plans to scrutinise VPN services in the country, aiming to limit access to only those services that align with government regulations.

A serious incident on GT Road near Kalashah Kako saw nine people injured when a van collided with a stationary truck, its driver unable to see the parked vehicle through the dense haze.The smog has also forced Lahore high court to mandate a shutdown of all trade activities by 8 pm and close markets on Sundays, aiming to minimize pollution-inducing activity.In Multan, conditions reached what experts called ""apocalyptic"" levels, with the AQI exceeding 2,000 on Friday morning.

Public parks and museums across major cities have been closed until at least November 17.Authorities have also faced criticism for failing to enforce preemptive anti-smog directives, with citizens often seen without masks despite the severe air quality.Multan, the largest city in southern Punjab, recorded an extremely dangerous Air Quality Index (AQI) of 2,135 between 8am and 9am on Friday, according to data from IQAir, as reported by Dawn.

At least 26 people — 14 soldiers, six railway employees and six civilian passengers — were killed and more than 60 injured in a suicide bombing at a railway station in Pakistan’s southwestern city of Quetta on Saturday. The proscribed Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), the most prominent militant group in the restive province, claimed responsibility for the attack, saying its suicide unit, the Majeed Brigade, had carried out the bombing to target a “Pakistani army unit” returning via train after completing a course at an infantry school.Authorities said the blast was a “suicide attack” primarily on law enforcement agencies, while civilians were also targeted. Forty-six among the injured were Pakistan army soldiers, police said. The explosion occurred as a popular morning train, Jaffar Express, was about to leave a station in Quetta for Peshawar in the northwest.Pakistan Railways had restored train services between Quetta and Peshawar last month after a suspension of seven weeks because separatist militants in Balochistan had blown up a key railway bridge in Aug.Social media videos captured Saturday’s explosion. The bomb went off when hundreds of people were at the platform. A video of the aftermath showed injured individuals and debris strewn throughout the station. The steel structure of the platform’s roof had been ripped apart.“The target was army personnel from the Infantry School,” said Muazzam Jah Ansari, police chief of Balochistan province.Wasim Baig, spokesperson for the provincial health department, said the death toll rose to 26 after two people succumbed to their injuries in hospital while 62 others were injured.The BLA has long waged an armed rebellion, driven by demands for independence and control over the province’s gas and mineral resources.Balochistan CM Sarfraz Bugti called the act deplorable and the perpetrators “worse than animals”. He said the authorities would pursue them and “bring them to their logical end”.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif denounced the bombing, saying those who orchestrated the attack “will pay a very heavy price for it”, adding that security forces were determined to eliminate “the menace of terrorism”.A decades-old insurgency has destabilised Balochistan and created security concerns for China-led projects trying to access the province’s untapped resources. In Aug at least 73 people were killed in Balochistan province after separatist militants attacked police stations, railway lines and highways.Balochistan is Pakistan’s largest province and the richest in terms of natural resources, but it is the least developed. The region shares a volatile border with Iran and Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, and also boasts a vast coastline along the Arabian Sea.The govt’s military operation to suppress the separatist movement in the province has resulted in widespread human rights abuses against Baloch dissenters, including disappearances, torture and extrajudicial killings.","14 soldiers, six railway employees and six civilian passengers killed.

Bangladesh leader Muhammad Yunus slams rich nations for burning up the planet at UN climate talks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-leader-muhammad-yunus-slams-rich-nations-for-burning-up-the-planet-at-un-climate-talks/articleshow/115261463.cms,"Muhammad Yunus (AP file photo)

BAKU: Bangladesh's interim leader Muhammad Yunus said Wednesday that world leaders shouldn't be negotiating at United Nations climate talks this year, and countries responsible for warming up the planet should instead just simply provide the funds to deal with the climate crisis.""Why should there be a negotiation? You are causing the problem, then you solve it,"" he told The Associated Press in an interview in Baku, Azerbaijan. ""We will raise our voice and tell them it's your fault, like what we did with colonialism.""Yunus was chosen to head Bangladesh's interim government after the nation's longtime prime minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled abroad. Her resignation followed intense political turmoil earlier this year, with weeks of protests and clashes with security forces that killed nearly 300 people. Known as the ""banker to the poorest of the poor,"" Yunus was a longtime critic of Hasina.Yunus said the climate negotiations, known as COP29, can be ""humiliating"" for poor countries. Yunus likened the talks to a ""fish market"" packed with people trying to get the best bargains. ""That's a very wrong perception of the whole thing,"" he said.Bangladesh is among the most vulnerable countries in the world to climate change. Various scientific reports have found that the South Asian nation could lose up to 17% of its land to rising seas and is also at the brunt of increasingly more frequent and intense cyclonic storms.But ""everyone's home is on fire,"" said Yunus. He said rich nations, who developed their economies by burning planet-warming coal, oil and gas, are ""not safe either. So they have to act in their self-interest as well as the interest of the whole planet.""Yunus said he will dedicate his time as leader to clean energy projects in Bangladesh and protecting the population against climate change.""Whether it's an interim government or no government or a democratic government, whatever government is in power should be aware and has to work hard to stop that fire,"" he said.","Yunus was chosen to head Bangladesh's interim government after the nation's longtime prime minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled abroad.

BNP worried interim govt may extend tenure

DHAKA: Bangladesh’s newly appointed interim govt adviser Mahfuj Alam has removed the portrait of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman from the Darbar Hall of Banga Bhaban, in what critics said was “complete and utter disrespect” of the country’s first president and the constitution.Banga Bhaban is the residence and main workplace of the President of Bangladesh.Posting a photo of himself at Darbar Hall after taking oath on Sunday, Mahfuj on Monday wrote on Facebook: “It is a shame for us that we couldn’t remove his pictures from Banga Bhaban after the 5th of August. Apologies.”A political activist, who wished to remain unnamed, suggested that the removal of Mujib’s portrait from Darbar Hall might be linked to a desire to alter the constitution and erase the spirit of 1971 Liberation War , “promoting a Pakistani ideology in Bangladesh”.The Bangladesh constitution mandates that the portrait of Mujibur be preserved and displayed at the offices of the president, PM, speaker, and chief justice, as well as at all govt and semi-govt offices.Mujibur is also the father of deposed PM Sheikh Hasina “No individual should change it (the constitution) with the stroke of a pen,” Kamal Hossain , one of the framers of the current constitution said, adding, “reforms should be carried out only after taking people’s opinions into account”.Suspecting that Bangladesh’s interim govt may be thinking of extending its tenure, the BNP has reminded the Muhammad Yunus-led dispensation that its primary duty is to promptly transfer power to elected representatives after conducting a fair election.On Monday, senior BNP politician Hafizuddin Ahmed claimed several individuals with pro-Awami League affiliations had been appointed to the interim govt’s advisory council.Two leading coordinators of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement have also criticised the new govt additions.The interim govt was expanded Sunday with the addition of three new advisers. Two of them — businessman Sk Bashir Uddin and popular filmmaker Mostofa Sarwar Farooki — are perceived to be linked to the deposed Sheikh Hasina govt.",Bangladesh’s newly appointed interim govt adviser Mahfuj Alam has removed the portrait of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman from the Darbar Hall of Banga Bhaban.
