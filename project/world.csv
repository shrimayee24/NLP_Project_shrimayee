Students sought cancellation of book fair due to exams: University

DEHRADUN: A book fair scheduled for Feb 15-16 at Uttarakhand's HNB Garhwal University , the state's only central university situated in Srinagar (Pauri Garwhal), has been cancelled, with organisers alleging pressure from right-wing groups for the cancellation. The event, titled 'Kitab Kauthik', a popular platform for book lovers which is annually organised by the group Creative Uttarakhand, was initially scheduled for Jan at Govt Girls' Inter College.""We had received permission from the school, but the management later cancelled it without assigning a reason. Since elections were approaching, we postponed the event to Feb,"" said Hem Pant, the fair's coordinator.The organisers then approached the central university for permission to hold the event at its premises and initially claimed to have received a go-ahead, which they said was later revoked. ""Representatives of the students' union and ABVP told us that 'books on Gandhi and Nehru were not fit to be sold'. They convinced the university to revoke the permission,"" Pant alleged.University spokesperson Ashutosh Bahuguna denied that permission was revoked due to pressure from any group. ""Our students' body suggested that holding a book fair may interfere with the ongoing exams and distract students, which is why the organisers were asked to find an alternate location,"" he said.Ashish Pant, a student union representative from RSS-backed ABVP, claimed there were no ideological reasons for the event's cancellation. ""Initially, approval was given to them for a small setup near the university library, but we later learned they had planned multiple cultural programmes. All of this was happening in the middle of exams. It was students themselves who raised concerns, which led to the university revoking the permission based on our recommendation."" He also rejected claims that ABVP had objected to the nature of the books that were to be sold.Meanwhile, the organisers tried to shift the fair to Ramlila Ground in Srinagar but met with a roadblock there too. ""The Ramlila Ground committee okayed holding the event but later we were told that RSS had already booked the venue for the same dates. We subsequently found that their application was dated Feb 10, while we had applied on Feb 9,"" said Hem Pant. He also alleged that the right-wing group covered book fair banners with their own posters.""When we sought clarification from the administration, we did not get a satisfactory response. This is a simple book fair designed for students and youngsters.. We bring over 50,000 books to small towns and the last edition was held in Tehri. Even CM Pushkar Singh Dhami encouraged us to organise more of them. Against this backdrop, such politically motivated discouragement is disheartening,"" he added.SDM Srinagar, Nupur Verma, when contacted, said, ""No application came to me from the book fair organisers, and the RSS event was already scheduled much earlier.""",Book fair scheduled for Feb 15-16 at Uttarakhand's HNB Garhwal University has been cancelled. Organisers allege pressure from right-wing groups for the cancellation. University denies that permission was revoked due to pressure from any group.

NEW DELHI: Two more United States flights carrying more illegal Indian immigrants are scheduled to land in Punjab's Amritsar on February 15-16 .A United States flight carrying second batch of 119 illegal Indian immigrants is scheduled to land on February 15.According to PTI official sources, the plane is expected to land at the airport around 10 pm on Saturday.Among the 119 illegal Indian immigrants, 67 hail from Punjab, 33 from Haryana, eight from Gujarat, three from Uttar Pradesh, two each from Goa, Maharashtra and Rajasthan and one each from Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir, the report said.Another US plane carrying deportees is also expected to land on February 16.The development comes hours after Prime Minister Narendra Modi met United States President Donald Trump and asserted the need to fight against the “ecosystem” of human trafficking that lures people from ordinary families with big dreams and promises and brought to other countries as illegal immigrants.This is not a question about India only but is a global issue, PM Modi said on the issue of illegal immigration during a joint press conference with Trump in the White House on Thursday.“We are of the opinion that anybody who enters and lives in another country illegally, they have absolutely no legal right or authority to live in that country,” PM Modi said.Earlier, a US military aircraft carrying 104 illegal Indian immigrants landed at the Shri Guru Ramdas Ji International Airport in Amritsar on February 5.While 30 of the deportees were from Punjab, 33 each were from Haryana and Gujarat, three each from Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, and two from Chandigarh.",A United States flight carrying second batch of 119 illegal Indian immigrants is scheduled to land on February 15.

NEW DELHI: Politics has erupted over the US military plan with illegal Indian immigrants landing in Punjab, with chief minister Bhagwant Mann calling it BJP's attempt to ""defame Punjabis and Punjab"".Mann's reaction came hours after it was confirmed that a second US fight with 119 illegal immigrants will be landing in Punjab's Amritsar on February 15-16.The first US flight carrying over 100 illegal Indian immigrants also landed at the Shri Guru Ramdas Ji International Airport in Amritsar on February 5.Criticising the BJP-led central government for choosing only Punjab for the landing of illegal immigrants, Bhagwant Mann said the Minister of External Affairs should tell ""the criteria based on which Amritsar was selected to land the aircraft"".""It is being said that out of the 119 illegal immigrants, 67 hail from Punjab and that's why the plane will land in Amritsar.

MARGAO: Vikat Bhagat, convicted in the 2017 rape-murder of an Irish national, lured the victim to a secluded spot in Canacona between 10pm and 7am where he committed the crime, according to prosecution. The autopsy revealed that the victim had suffered cerebral damage and constriction of the neck, which led to her death. She had also sustained severe injuries to her face and head from a broken bottle.The prosecution's case was strengthened by substantial physical evidence. Police discovered injury marks on Bhagat's groin and thigh, believed to have been sustained during the assault. The victim's blood was found on his clothes and scooter, and investigators recovered a backpack containing blood-stained clothing near his residence in Canacona.Investigating officer (IO) Rajendra Prabhudessai, now a DSP, told TOI that the prosecution phase proved more challenging than the investigation. ""There were instances in the initial stages of trial where witnesses were threatened and even requested to turn hostile, but we managed to keep them safe and on the side of the prosecution,"" he said.Covid further complicated the trial by disrupting communication between police, prosecution and witnesses. In one notable instance, a key witness who relocated to New Zealand had to be traced and convinced to return to India. His testimony was ultimately heard via video conferencing from a sessions court in Bhopal. Another witness from Kerala, who returned to his hometown during the pandemic, was located only after court notices were posted at his residence. ""The difficult part was to keep the witnesses together and testify as per statements to police,"" he said.During the trial, which saw testimonies from 46 witnesses, defence advocate Arun Bras de Sa argued for leniency, citing that the evidence was circumstantial. However, public prosecutor Devendra Korgaonkar pressed for maximum punishment, emphasising the heinous nature of the crime.The victim's family, in a statement reported by Daily Mail, said ""justice has finally been achieved"". They said ""there was no other suspect or gang involved"" and that Bhagat was ""solely responsible for cruelly ending her beautiful life"".The case saw multiple delays over the years. Initially after his arrest, Bhagat confessed to the crime but later retracted his statement through a 29-page letter, claiming the involvement of three others. However, police investigation ruled out the involvement of other suspects.Before the crime, the victim had celebrated Holi on Palolem beach with an Australian friend along with whom she had travelled to India. CCTV footage captured her walking with Bhagat, whom she knew from previous visits to India, in the hours before her death.","Vikat Bhagat was convicted in the 2017 rape-murder of an Irish national.

AGRA: A wedding photo posted online has miraculously put an end to a 17-year-old girl's ordeal that lasted months after she was abducted, bundled into a waiting car and drugged by a man she knew on May 18, 2024. She was on her way to a coaching institute in Mainpuri at that time.In the next eight months, the Class 11 student was trafficked from one city to another, sexually abused for weeks, raped, sold, resold, till she reached Ajmer (Rajasthan), about 650km away from her hometown. This time, she was bought for Rs 3.5 lakh by a man, Vishnu Mali, who was looking for a ""young bride"".Excited at wedding prospects, the Ajmer-based man flooded his social media with photographs alongside the girl. That's when luck turned for the distraught teenager. The posts reached Mainpuri and someone recognised her as the girl who went missing, months ago. Police got into action and Mali was picked up by cops in Rajasthan. The girl has now been brought back to Mainpuri.""We reached a breakthrough after a thorough probe, which included scanning social media account of the accused. It came to light that a man named Neeraj handed over the girl to Mali in Ajmer. The accused persons were booked under BNS sections for rape, abduction, human trafficking , along with Pocso Act. He was arrested, presented before a court in Mainpuri on Thursday and sent to jail,"" a cop, privy to the case, said on Friday.In her statement, the girl narrated her harrowing experience.

""I am pleased to announce that my administration has approved the extradition of one of the plotters (Tahawwur Rana) and one of the very evil people of the world, having to do with the horrific 2008 Mumbai terrorist attack to face justice in India.""""He is going back to India to face justice,"" he added.Additionally, the India-US joint statement said, ""The leaders further called on Pakistan to expeditiously bring to justice the perpetrators of the 26/11 Mumbai, and Pathankot attacks and ensure that its territory is not used to carry out cross-border terrorist attacks.""Reacting to this, Pakistan said that its reference in the statement was ""misleading"".""We consider the Pakistan's specific reference in the Indo-US joint statement of 13th February, 2025, as one-sided, misleading and contrary to diplomatic norms.

Nor can they shift international attention from stark reality of India being a safe haven for the perpetrators of hate crimes against Muslims and other minorities,"" it added.Earlier, the US state department said that it is evaluating the next steps regarding Tahawwur Rana's extradition to India.A spokesperson from the State Department told that the US has long supported India's efforts to bring to justice the perpetrators of the 26/11 Mumbai attacks case.""Tahawwur Rana, a Canadian citizen of Pakistani origin, is accused of involvement in the 2008 Mumbai attacks that killed 166 people, including six Americans. He has been linked to Pakistani-American terrorist David Coleman Headley, a key conspirator in the attacks. India had requested his extradition from the US, a move that was supported by the US government. However, Rana repeatedly challenged the decision in American courts.His appeals against extradition were rejected by lower courts, and in August 2023, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that the India-US Extradition Treaty allowed for his extradition. Rana then filed a petition with the US Supreme Court to block the decision. The US Solicitor General urged the court to reject his plea, reinforcing the US government's stance in favor of India's extradition request.On January 25, the US Supreme Court denied Rana’s final petition, effectively clearing the way for his extradition to India. With this ruling, Rana is now set face trial in India.","Tahawwur Rana, a Canadian citizen of Pakistani origin, is accused of involvement in the 2008 Mumbai attacks that killed 166 people, including six Americans.

A mourning ritual turned into community feast in celebration



PRAYAGRAJ: To the list of superstitions linked with 'unlucky' 13 has been added the lucky coincidence of a presumed Maha Kumbh stampede victim from Prayagraj trudging back home this Tuesday to find the neighbourhood commemorating his 'tehrvi' - the ritual performed on 13th day after a death.Turns out 60-something Khunti Guru , nonplussed at the fuss over his rumoured death in the Jan 29 stampede, had had one chillum of ganja too many with some sadhus and lost track of time.Almost two weeks would go by before he remembered that his 10x12 room in Chahchand Gali of Prayagraj's Zero Road was waiting for him. By then, Khunti Guru's extended family comprising almost the entire locality had organised elaborate religious rituals in memory of the much-loved local jester.""I slept rather long... could be a few days,"" the 'Dead Man Walking' said, responding to the barrage of questions and curious looks that greeted his arrival. Khunti Guru's tehrvi was quickly forgotten in the euphoria of seeing him alive, but not the food. What was meant to be a mourning ritual turned into community feasting in celebration of the popular, happy-go-lucky character's 'rebirth'.Abhai Awasthi, a social worker, said Khunti Guru, stepped out on the evening of Jan 28, telling whomever he met in Chahchand Gali that he would be back after a dip at Sangam on Mauni Amavasya .""The stampede happened early the next day and we got worried about him. We looked for him everywhere we could but there was no trace of him. Finally, presuming him dead, we organised prayers for him,"" Awasthi told TOI.Just as the rituals were nearing completion, a familiar figure alighted from an e-rickshaw. ""Our beloved Khunti Guru asked us smilingly, ""What are you people up to?' It's hard describing how we felt,"" Awasthi said.Locals say his father, Kanhaiyala Mishra, was a reputable lawyer. Not much is known about what happened to the family but Khunti Guru apparently didn't complete his education and stayed back in the area.The room he now lives in is apparently what remains of the Mishra family's ancestral home. Shopkeepers in the neighbourhood give him food and clothing in return for their daily fix of gossip, peppered with anecdotes delivered in Khunti Guru's inimitable style. ""Although he has a bed in his room, Khunti Guru prefers sleeping in the compound of a local Shiva temple,"" a resident said.",'Dead Man Walking' Khunti Guru returns home to find neighbourhood commemorating his 'tehrvi' - the ritual performed on 13th day after a death.

Such steps accentuate military imbalances in the region and undermine strategic stability.

Combs' lawyers denounce 'false claims'

'1-800-lawyer' controversy

An unidentified woman who accused rappers Jay-Z and Sean “Diddy” Combs of raping her when she was 13 has withdrawn her lawsuit against both men, according to court documents filed on Friday.Last December, the woman first sued Combs in a Manhattan federal court and later added Jay-Z (Shawn Carter) to the case.She alleged that in 2000, Combs' limousine driver offered her a ride to an MTV Video Music Awards after-party, where she was taken to a house and later raped.The court filing did not specify any reasons for dropping the caseJay-Z had strongly denied the allegations while actively seeking to be removed from the case and welcomed the withdrawal as a victory.""The frivolous, fictitious and appalling allegations have been dismissed,"" he said on social media. ""This civil suit was without merit and never going anywhere.""Combs, who remains in jail in New York facing federal sex trafficking charges , has also been accused in multiple sexual assault lawsuits. Many of these cases have been filed by Texas lawyer Tony Buzbee, who claims to represent over 150 people alleging abuse by the music mogul.The lawsuit filed in December stated that the alleged victim was dropped off at Radio City Music Hall, where she tried but failed to get a ticket. She then approached limousine drivers, hoping for access to the show or an after-party. One driver, who claimed to work for Combs, allegedly told her she ""fit what Diddy was looking for.""Later, the driver picked her up and took her to a white house with a U-shaped driveway. She was reportedly asked to sign what she believed was a nondisclosure agreement but was not given a copy. Inside, she claimed the house was filled with celebrities, along with people using marijuana and cocaine.After accepting a drink, she began to feel dizzy and needed to lie down. While resting in a room, she alleged that Combs and Jay-Z entered and asked, ""You ready to party?"" She then detailed the assault, accusing Jay-Z of raping her while Combs and another woman watched.Following the lawsuit's dismissal, Combs’ legal team suggested that other claims against him were equally baseless.""For months, we have seen case after case filed by individuals hiding behind anonymity, pushed forward by an attorney more focused on media headlines than legal merit. Just like this claim, the others will fall apart because there is no truth to them,"" they said in a statement.They further added that Combs ""has never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone – man or woman, adult or minor.""Both Jay-Z and Combs took a swipe at lawyer Tony Buzbee's firm, dismissively referring to it as the ""1-800-lawyer."" The phrase alludes to law firms that advertise heavily and handle a high volume of cases, often perceived as being more focused on publicity and financial gain than on justice.Jay-Z accused Buzbee, suggesting that the lawsuits were more about a money grab than legitimate claims.""When they quickly realise that the money grab is going to fail, they get to walk away with no repercussions,"" Jay-Z said.

WASHINGTON: One of Elon Musk 's closest friends, a billionaire co-founder of Airbnb , is taking a role in President Trump's administration to help Musk carry out his drive to slash the federal bureaucracy, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.Joe Gebbia , the Airbnb co-founder, is a board member at Tesla who lives in Austin, Texas, where Musk, Tesla's CEO, keeps a large compound. He is planning to start shortly in the federal govt as part of Musk's DOGE team, according to the person with knowledge of the matter. It is not clear what precisely Gebbia will do or how formal his role will be.Many members of Musk's govt-overhaul effort float among agencies depending on the day's tasks. Many of them consider their centre of gravity to be the office of personnel management or the general services administration.Early Friday, Gebbia arrived at OPM's downtown Washington headquarters in a black SUV with a three-person security detail. He declined to comment as he was escorted inside by an OPM official and one of his bodyguards.Musk and his allies have taken over the US Digital Service, now renamed the United States DOGE Service. The agency was established in 2014 to fix the federal govt's online services.

Gebbia attended Kennedy's confirmation hearing last month, writing on the social platform X that morning that it was a ""big day ahead for the future of health in America.""Gebbia did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday evening.In a post on X the day before Trump's inauguration, Gebbia said he had voted for Democrats dating back to Al Gore in 2000 but acknowledged supporting Trump in Nov.","Joe Gebbia is a board member at Tesla who lives in Austin, Texas, where Musk, Tesla's CEO, keeps a large compound.

Hamas' shifting position on hostage releases

Hostage exchange under ceasefire agreement

73 hostages still held in Gaza

US President Donald Trump has warned of serious repercussions if Hamas fails to release all remaining hostages in Gaza by noon on Saturday.Speaking to reporters on Friday, he reiterated his demand, saying, ""let all hell break out"" if Hamas does not release the hostages, insisting they should be freed in full and not ""in drips and drabs.""""As far as I'm concerned, if all of the hostages aren't returned by Saturday at 12 o'clock – I think it's an appropriate time – I would say, cancel it and all bets are off, and let hell break out,"" Trump said, according to CNN.When asked about what might happen if Hamas fails to meet the deadline, Trump said, ""I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow at 12 o'clock. If it were up to me, I'd take a very hard stance. I can't tell you what Israel is going to do.""He also described the condition of the released hostages, saying they looked weak after their captivity in Gaza. ""One guy was a big, strong, healthy guy... He looks like he just came out of the Holocaust. It looks like a Holocaust picture,"" Trump said, criticising Hamas for its treatment of hostages.Earlier this week, Hamas stated that it would not release more hostages, citing Israel's violations of ceasefire negotiations, but later changed its stance.""They said, ‘We're not going to release any more hostages as we said we were.’ I said, ‘Good, you have till 12 o'clock on Saturday,’ which is tomorrow. And we didn't hear anything. Then, all of a sudden, two days ago, they said, ‘No, we've decided we're going to release the hostages,’"" Trump explained.He further added, ""I think they should release all of the hostages. As bad as they look, the ones that follow probably will look a lot worse. I think they're sending out their most healthy.""Meanwhile, Israel’s Prime Minister's Office confirmed receiving the names of three hostages—Sagui Dekel Chen, Sasha Troufanov, and Iair Horn—set to be freed by Hamas on Saturday. The release is part of the sixth hostage-prisoner exchange under the ongoing ceasefire agreement.Hamas had previously threatened to delay further hostage releases, accusing Israel of violating the ceasefire deal. However, with mediation from Egypt and Qatar, the group backed down from its threat and agreed to proceed with the release.Under the ceasefire agreement, Hamas has released 16 Israelis and five Thai hostages in exchange for Israel freeing around 2,000 Palestinian security prisoners, including hundreds serving life sentences for terror-related offences.Since the October 7 Hamas attacks, 251 people have been taken hostage. According to the Israel Defence Forces (IDF), 73 hostages remain in Gaza, including at least 35 confirmed dead.Trump has made it clear that he expects all remaining hostages to be freed immediately. ""Hamas will find out what I mean,"" he said, hinting at consequences if his deadline is not met. ""I'm speaking for myself. Israel can override it, but from myself, Saturday at 12 o'clock, and if they're not – they're not here, all hell is going to break out.""According to Gaza's health ministry, over 48,000 Palestinians have been killed since the October 2023 conflict between Israel and Hamas.","US President Donald Trump has warned of serious repercussions if Hamas fails to release all remaining hostages in Gaza by noon on Saturday.

He suggested that these efforts are part of a broader initiative to influence public opinion and destabilise governments.Benz said that ""celebrities who can be trained to spread desired messaging"" are actively recruited and used as ""network nodes."" He cited NATO-linked initiatives and USAID-backed music diplomacy programs as key drivers behind these efforts. ""Taylor Swift has worked in various things before that have been empirically shown to move the needle on government initiatives,"" he said, referring to her involvement in voter engagement and public health campaigns.He also pointed to the Pentagon’s involvement in the music industry, alleging that military funding has played a significant role in shaping cultural narratives. ""Look at who the biggest sponsor of South by Southwest is in Texas now. It’s the military. Go ahead and look up the scandal if you want about South by Southwest Pentagon funding. They've taken over the music industry because it’s hearts and minds work,"" Benz said.According to Benz, the US government has used similar tactics worldwide, particularly through USAID’s music diplomacy program. ""Just like they were giving Dua Lipa the awards, just like they’re working with Pussy Riot, just like they have 22... In fact, you can look this up if you want—the State Department Music Diplomacy Program. Twenty-two rappers. You’ll see again, these people become network nodes. They become assets to play with.""He further claimed that USAID has supported artists in various countries to promote anti-government sentiment. ""There’s evidence to suggest the same play around recruiting hip-hop artists in Cuba,"" Benz said. ""It was protest rock, it was protest rap. In Cuba, for that USAID operation, it was protest rap.""He referenced a report from The Grayzone, which allegedly revealed that US-backed programs in Bangladesh had commissioned rap songs designed to incite street protests and political reform. ""Those documents that The Grayzone published have two rap songs in Bangladesh with lines like they were designed to inspire anti-government sentiment and to promote street protests and political reform.

The program involved bringing these musicians to Washington, DC, for an intensive training period.However, a community note on social media disputed Benz’s claims, stating that the only known connection between USAID and Dua Lipa was its funding for a music school in Kosovo. The note detailed how USAID supported the launch of Allegra School of Arts in Gjakova, aimed at providing formal musical education to Kosovan youth.Benz’s comments come amid heightened scrutiny of US foreign influence programs, particularly under the Trump administration. Recently, Elon Musk has also criticised USAID and other agencies, calling for their dismantling. Musk suggested that organisations like the National Endowment for Democracy have failed in their stated missions, asking, ""How much democracy have they achieved lately?""","Former US official Mike Benz claims USAID has trained musical artists to act as ""assets"" in spreading political narratives for statecraft purposes.

US Vice President JD Vance on Thursday announced that America might impose sanctions and consider military intervention if Russia's Vladimir Putin fails to conclude the ongoing Ukraine conflict, which has lasted nearly three years.Speaking to the Wall Street Journal, Vance said, “There are economic tools of leverage, there are of course military tools of leverage” that could be deployed against Putin.The vice president indicated that deploying US forces to Ukraine remains a possibility if the Kremlin fails to engage sincerely in peace negotiations.This stance contradicts Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's statement in Brussels on Wednesday during a meeting of Ukraine allies, where he dismissed the prospect of US military presence in the conflict zone.Hegseth emphasised that post-peace agreement security assurances for Ukraine must be supported by ""capable European and non-European troops.""A crucial meeting is scheduled at the Munich Security Conference in Germany between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and a US delegation, including Vice President Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and special envoy Keith Kellogg, New York Post reported.The discussions will focus on war resolution strategies.Regarding Trump's approach to mediating between Kyiv and Moscow, Vance stated, ""The president is not going to go in this with blinders on.

The specifics of security guarantees from the US or European nations would be determined during negotiations, according to Vance.He indicated that Trump might adjust negotiating terms based on how discussions progress.Vance elaborated on Trump's flexibility, suggesting items could be added or removed from negotiations depending on the parties' behaviour and Ukrainian priorities.Trump posted on Truth Social: ""[W]e want to stop the millions of deaths taking place in the War with Russia/Ukraine.""Later Thursday, Trump confirmed Ukraine's participation in Russian negotiations whilst expressing support for Russia's return to the G-7.","US Vice President JD Vance said the US might impose sanctions and consider military intervention if Russia's Vladimir Putin fails to conclude the ongoing Ukraine conflict.

ISLAMABAD: At least 10 people were killed and six injured a bomb planted by the road exploded as a pickup truck carrying coal mine workers went by in Harnai district of southwestern Balochistan province on Friday, officials said.Hazrat Wali Kakar, Harnai’s top civilian official, said the bomb was an improvised explosive device (IED). “Ten mining workers were killed in the attack,” Kakar said.Saleem Tareen, another local official, said most of the victims were from the country’s northwestern Swat Valley in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province. “The labourers were traveling to a market in Harnai,” he added. Harnai lies some 160 km east of Quetta, the capital of Balochistan province.Authorities said they were investigating the attack, with officials saying evidence was being collected and that preliminary investigation showed the explosive material had been planted on the roadside.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack yet. But the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), a militant organisation fighting for independence, is active in the restive province that borders Afghanistan and Iran. The group usually targets security forces as well as Pakistanis from other provinces. Local media reported that most of the workers killed or injured came from KP’s Puran village.The BLA has also targeted Chinese projects in the region, arguing that foreigners are exploiting resource-rich Balochistan while the impoverished residents are left behind.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif responded to the incident by reaffirming his commitment to aggressively working to eradicate terrorism in the country.",A bomb planted by the road exploded as a pickup truck carrying coal mine workers went by.

Fourteen Democratic state attorneys general sued Elon Musk and President Donald Trump on Thursday to challenge what they called the ""unlawful delegation of executive power"" granted to Musk and his cost-cutting initiative, the so-called department of govt efficiency (DOGE).The lawsuit came on the same day that Musk and his team were sued by a group of govt employees represented by the State Democracy Defenders Fund, a nonprofit watchdog. The coalition argued that Musk's attempts to dismantle agencies, stop the payment of congressionally approved funds and have access to sensitive govt data exceeded his authority.DOGE, which is not an official department but an entity housed within the executive office of the president, has already faced numerous legal challenges over its attempts to overhaul govt agencies and cut spending. Since Trump's inauguration, Musk's team has inserted itself into at least 19 agencies, according to a tally by the New York Times.The White House and representatives of Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The 14 states argued that Trump had violated the appointments clause of the Constitution by granting sweeping powers to Musk, who has ""transformed a minor position that was formerly responsible for managing govt websites into a designated agent of chaos without limitation,"" according to the complaint, which was filed in the US district court for the District of Columbia.""Mr Musk's seemingly limitless and unchecked power to strip the govt of its work force and eliminate entire departments with the stroke of a pen or click of a mouse would have been shocking to those who won this country's independence,"" the complaint reads. ""The sweeping authority now vested in a single unelected and unconfirmed individual is antithetical to the nation's entire constitutional structure.""The states also asserted that Musk's actions could harm their residents by disrupting billions of dollars in federal funding for critical services like law enforcement, education and health care. They argued that, for instance, Musk's desire to dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau could require states to invest far more resources and personnel to ""protect their citizens.""The suit was filed by the attorneys general in New Mexico, Arizona, Michigan, California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington, Vermont.","Fourteen Democratic state attorneys general sued Elon Musk and President Donald Trump on Thursday to challenge what they called the ""unlawful delegation of executive power"" The lawsuit came on the same day that Musk and his team were sued by a group of govt employees.

'Alarming': AP denounces Trump administration's position on Gulf of America policy



After the Oval Office, the White House again barred Associated Press reporters from accessing Air Force One over the ""Gulf of America"" policy.White House deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich said that the new agency's ignorance towards changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America shows their commitment to misinformation.""The Associated Press continues to ignore the lawful geographic name change of the Gulf of America. This decision is not just divisive, but it also exposes the Associated Press' commitment to misinformation.

Associate Press journalists and photographers will retain their credentials to the White House complex,"" he added.Since Tuesday, AP journalists have been prohibited from attending President Donald Trump's Oval Office events due to their non-compliance with his executive order regarding the Gulf's renaming.Earlier, President Donald Trump announced that February 9 would be the first ""Gulf of America Day,"" a move that came after an executive order that set in motion the process of changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico.In a January 23 guidance, AP said it would refer to the Gulf of Mexico “by its original name while acknowledging the new name Trump has chosen.”""As a global news agency that disseminates news around the world, the AP must ensure that place names and geography are easily recognizable to all audiences,"" it added.The AP's refusal to follow the Gulf of America policy has irked the Trump administration.Julie Pace, AP's editor-in-chief, denounced the administration's position as an infringement of free speech rights and detrimental to AP's global audience seeking impartial news.""It is alarming that the Trump administration would punish AP for its independent journalism. Limiting our access to the Oval Office based on the content of AP’s speech not only severely impedes the public’s access to independent news, it plainly violates the First Amendment,"" Pace said in a statement.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt defended the new designation on Wednesday, citing its official adoption by the interior secretary and implementation by Google and Apple on their maps.The White House Correspondents' Association condemned AP's exclusion as ""outrageous"", with president Eugene Daniels warning about potential restrictions on press freedom.Daniels emphasised this action contradicts both First Amendment principles and the president's own directive on speech freedom and federal censorship.Budowich confirmed that whilst AP staff would lose access to specific areas, they would maintain their general White House complex credentials.","White House deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich said that the new agency's ignorance towards changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico shows their commitment to misinformation.

What is the case all about?



Another prosecutor of New York Mayor Eric Adams' corruption cases stepped down. As he stepped down the eyebrows raised on the future of this case.Assistant US attorney Hagan Scotten stepped down on Friday after receiving directives from the Trump's justice department to abandon the case, becoming the latest federal attorney to resign in protest of this unusual demand.""No system of liberty can allow the Government to use the carrot of dismissing charges, or the stick of threatening to bring them again, to induce an elected official to support its policy objectives,"" Scotten said.The Democratic mayor faced increasing calls to step down, while pressure grew for New York Governor Kathy Hochul to exercise her authority to remove him as the head of America's largest city, AFP News Agency reported.Danielle Sassoon, appointed by President Donald Trump as acting US attorney for the Southern District of New York, tendered her resignation to Attorney General Pam Bondi on Thursday, three days after receiving instructions to drop the Adams case.Bove, previously Trump's personal lawyer, requested the charges' dismissal, claiming Adams's prosecution hindered his ""ability to devote full attention and resources to illegal immigration and violent crime.""Scotten's email to Bove stated ""our laws and traditions do not allow using the prosecutorial power to influence other citizens, much less elected officials.""""If no lawyer within earshot of the President is willing to give him that advice, then I expect you will eventually find someone who is enough of a fool, or enough of a coward, to file your motion,"" he said.

He also ordered action against those involved ""in heinous acts like human trafficking,"" according to a statement.Most of the victims came from Kurram, a district in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan , where hundreds of people have been killed in recent years in sectarian clashes.""People try to travel to Europe through illegal means because of unemployment"" at home, said Javed Hussain, a nephew of Shehzad Hussain, one of the victims. He said mourners were gathering at the homes of those who perished in the latest tragedy.In January, authorities said dozens of Pakistanis died when a boat capsized off West Africa. Some of the survivors later accused smugglers of killing 43 migrants in a dispute over payment. Pakistan has since confirmed the deaths of 13 of its nationals.Hundreds of Pakistanis die every year while trying to reach Europe by land and sea with the help of human smugglers. They also use dangerous land and sea routes to reach Europe in an effort to find jobs.Libya, which has borders with six nations and a long shore on the Mediterranean, was plunged into chaos following a Nato-backed uprising that toppled and killed longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. Since then, the oil-rich country has emerged as the dominant transit point for migrants fleeing war and poverty in Africa and the Middle East for Europe.At least 674 migrants were reported dead and more than 1,000 missing off Libya in 2024, according to the International Organization for Migration's missing migrants project. More than 21,700 migrants were intercepted and returned to the chaos-stricken country.In 2023, the IOM reported 962 migrants dead and 1,563 missing off Libya. Around 17,200 migrants were intercepted and returned to Libya that year, it said.Those who are returned are held in government-run detention centers rife with abuses, including forced labor, beatings, rapes and torture - practices that amount to crimes against humanity, according to UN-commissioned investigators. The abuse often accompanies attempts to extort money from the families of the imprisoned migrants before releasing them or allowing them to leave Libya on traffickers' boats to Europe.","At least 16 Pakistanis died and 10 others are unaccounted for after a boat carrying dozens of Europe-bound migrants sank off Libya.
