Twin cloudbursts led to Kishtwar tragedy: Deputy Commissioner,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/twin-cloudbursts-led-to-kishtwar-tragedy-deputy-commissioner/articleshow/123664300.cms,"SRINAGAR: A preliminary investigation has found that two cloudbursts occurred approximately 13km from the remote village of Chasoti in Jammu and Kashmir’s Kishtwar district on Aug 14, triggering flash floods that killed 65 people and left several missing.“Chasoti (tragedy) was not a Glacial Lake Outburst Flood event,” Kishtwar Deputy Commissioner Pankaj Kumar Sharma said, adding that the findings were based on a joint study by a mountaineering team and geological experts. J&K Police’s mountain rescue team also contributed to the report after studying the area along with a mountaineer who has summited Mt Everest.The dual cloudbursts had unleashed torrents of water, mud, boulders, and uprooted trees that swept into the small hamlet nestled in Chenab Valley — the last village en route Machail Mata temple — where hundreds of pilgrims had been camping. The surge hit around 11.40am, flattening everything in its war — houses, langars, three temples, vehicles, and even a bridge.A 2024-2025 govt study on GLOFs in Kishtwar is being discussed again. In the report, the district disaster management authority had warned that GLOF presents significant challenges to the community, infrastructure, and the environment in the region. It also stated that GLOFs present a major hazard to Padder, Machail, Dachhan, Marwah, and Warwan tehsils and areas near Kishtwar high altitude national park.These places are especially vulnerable due to their proximity to glacial lakes, making them prone to sudden flooding events that can have a devastating impact on the region. The report highlighted that Marwah and Warwan were more susceptible to danger and are designated “shadow areas” due to their remoteness, low-lying settlements and limited disaster preparedness and emergency response capacity. On Aug 26 this year, Warwan Valley was hit by a cloudburst, damaging around 190 houses and killing 45 cattle.GLOF events also pose a threat to Padder tehsil, which houses major power projects, the report stated. Infrastructure (roads, schools, hospitals, etc.) in Machail, Dachhan, and Marwah is also at considerable risk, the report said.","A preliminary investigation has found that two cloudbursts occurred approximately 13km from the remote village of Chasoti in Jammu and Kashmir’s Kishtwar district on Aug 14, triggering flash floods that killed 65 people and left several missing. “Chasoti (tragedy) was not a Glacial Lake Outburst Flood event,” KishTwar Deputy Commissioner Pankaj Kumar Sharma said.

BRS suspends K Kavitha: Why KCR removed daughter from party; family feud explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/brs-suspends-k-kavitha-why-kcr-removed-daughter-from-party-family-feud-explained/articleshow/123653161.cms,"K Kavitha has been expelled from the party by her father because of anti-party activities.

Who are Kavitha's cousins and what did she say?



Kavitha was removed from Telangana Boggu Gani Karmika Sangham in August



No Raksha-Bandhan between Kavitha KTR this year



Kavitha's six-page letter to KCR in May



Liquor scam and Kavitha's arrest



NEW DELHI: Former Telangana chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao suspended his daughter K Kavitha from the BRS days after she spoke up against her cousin and former minister Harish Rao for tarnishing her father's image. ""The party leadership is taking this matter seriously as the recent behaviour and ongoing anti-party activities of party MLC K Kavitha are damaging the BRS party. Party President K. Chandrasekhar Rao has taken a decision to suspend K Kavitha from the party with immediate effect,"" BRS posted on X.The immediate reason for the expulsion is Kavitha's recent statements against her cousins, T Harish Rao and Santosh Kumar. Kavitha said they have a tacit understanding with chief minister Revanth Reddy to defame her father as the Revanth Reddy government decided to order a CBI probe into the alleged irregularities in the Kaleshwaram project, which was built during the BRS regime.""We (BRS cadre) have to think why the taint of corruption came to KCR. Some who are close to KCR have benefited in many ways by making use of his name. KCR's name is getting defamed today because of their misdeeds.How can the party move ahead if the same persons are encouraged,"" Kavitha said.""Did Harish Rao, who was irrigation minister for five years, not have a major role in this? That's why KCR sidelined him (Harish Rao) in the second term (in power). Two, three persons are responsible for the taint on KCR in the whole episode of Kaleshwaram, While Harish Rao is one, former Rajya Sabha member (Santosh Kumar) is another,"" she said.But the rift goes a long way as Kavitha was being cornered in the party and her actions were held responsible for this.Weeks before, Kavitha was removed as honorary president of the Telangana Boggu Gani Karmika Sangham. Kavitha said it was a political conspiracy as the internal crisis was deepening.Kavitha has been openly speaking out against her party and raised questions over the handling of internal matters.According to reports, this was the first year that Kavitha skipped the Raksha Bandhan celebration. When she was asked before the occasion if she would tie a rakhi to KTR, her only brother, she said she would. But later, Kavitah disclosed that she was told that KTR was not in Bengaluru and not in Hyderabad.As Kavitha started the second innings of her political career, after taking a break as she got bail last year, she became vocal -- against her own party. In May, she wrote a six-page letter to father, and said KCR, of late, was lacking force. Kavitha criticised KCR's speech on the occasion of the party's silver jubilee and pointed out that the former chief minister omitted several key issues and his oratory was missing.Kavitha was arrested by the ED in March 2024 in the liquor scam case. Kavitha was part of the alleged South cartel in the scam, as the ED alleged that Kavitha conspired with Arvind Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia to influence the formulation and execution of the Delhi excise policy for 2021–22. In return, she is accused of arranging ₹100 crore in kickbacks for them.In August 2024, Kavitha was granted bail.Daughter of KCR, sister of KT Rama Rao, K Kavitha was born in Karimnagar and studied in Hyderabad. Kavitha studied B Tech. in Computer Science from VNRVJIET and an MS in Computer Science from the University of Southern Mississippi. After returning to India, she took her political plunge and was a key figure in the Telangana statehood movement alongside her father. Kavitha was elected the MP from Nizamabad in 2014, becoming the first woman MP of the TRS (now BRS). In 2019, she lost the election but was elected as an MLC from Nizamabad.","Former Telangana chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao suspended his daughter K Kavitha from the BRS.

"Kathua cops bust drug syndicate, arrest 4",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kathua-cops-bust-drug-syndicate-arrest-4/articleshow/123664385.cms,"JAMMU: Kathua Police have busted an interstate drug trafficking syndicate involved in collecting air-dropped narcotics consignments from Pakistan via drones, smuggling the contraband to other parts of the country, and sending the proceeds of the sales to Pakistan. Cops arrested three men from Punjab and one from Kashmir in this connection, SSP Shobhit Saxena said at a press conference on Tuesday.On July 29, police received information about a narcotics consignment being drone-dropped in Chhan Tanda village near the international border in Kathua’s Hiranagar sector. Acting swiftly, a joint team of cops and BSF seized approximately 447g of opium. Hiranagar PS filed a case under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and launched a probe.During the investigation, police arrested two drug couriers — Punjab natives Sukhwinder Singh (Amritsar) and Arshdeep Singh (Gurdaspur) — tasked with collecting the drone-dropped drug packages and supplying them to traffickers. The duo was employed in an NHAI project in Samba’s Ghagwal, the SSP said.Their arrest led to the recovery of 411g of heroin meant to be supplied to traffickers at the next available opportunity, Saxena said.Police subsequently arrested the receiver, Feroz Din of Kathua’s Rajbagh, and found that he had been in touch with a Pakistan-based drug smuggler.Further questioning of the accused led cops to a drug kingpin and financier from Punjab’s Tarn Taran. “He was also in touch with the same Pakistan-based smuggler and was responsible for sending the proceeds of narcotics sale to Pakistan via hawala channels,” said the SSP, adding that cops seized heroin and cash from Feroz Din as well as the drug kingpin.Investigations revealed that the accused had already supplied over 30kg of heroin that had been air-dropped via drones into Punjab and J&K and circulated by drug peddlers in adjoining districts. “They ran a sophisticated syndicate, taking all precautions to evade law enforcement. Further investigation is underway, and more recovery and arrests are expected in the coming days,” SSP Saxena said.In a separate case, Kathua Police arrested two suspects — Murad Ali and Bagh Hussain — with cash and heroin earlier in July, the SSP said. Based on their statements, cops arrested three more men and seized 20g of heroin from the trio.","Kathua Police busted interstate drug trafficking syndicate involved in collecting air-dropped narcotics consignments from Pakistan via drones.

IShowSpeed’s viral unconventional visit to the US Capitol building



“We are at the Capitol, right now. It’s not the time.”

IShowSpeed, a popular streamer who is out on his Speed Does America Tour, recently got to have a tour inside the US Capitol building. While many loved this unexpected tour, a reporter ignited a fierce debate about the tour inside the Capitol building. It made the political streamer Hasan Piker, aka HasanAbi, fire back at the journalist, who questioned the appropriateness of Speed’s access to the restricted areas.Here is all we know about the reporter's comments, IShowSpeed Speed Does America Tour Capitol building controversy and how HasanAbi reacted to them.Rather than addressing any procedural concerns or any other issues pointed out by the Journalist Benjamin Weiss, political streamer HasanAbi launched a direct counter-attack during his broadcast. In the clip, HasanAbi swiftly dismissed the observations of the reporter. In video, HasanAbi responds to reporter saying,he stated.HasanAbi further added, speculating that Weiss was not being serious or was attempting to narc on the streamer for getting him in any trouble. He even expressed confidence in Congressman Maxwell Alejandro Frost, saying he would have securedfor this Capitol building live tour.With his simple yet effective clarification, he framed the entire criticism as non-issue and something that stems from just professional bitterness instead of a genuine inquiry into the Capitol Hill protocols.The controversy started as Journalist Benjamin Weiss came forward on social media, pointing out the IShowSpeed tour inside the US Capitol building. He didn’t just comment but targeted Speed and his guide, Rep. Maxwell Frost.Pointing to the filming in areas where the reporters, as per him, are “strictly not allowed,” for operating, Benjamin Weiss comments questioned whether the usual rules apply when the House remains out of session. Weiss even pointed out in his made post, about the casual attire of the streamer in the formal Speaker’s Lobby.With streamer IShowSpeed being in Washington, D.C., he received a tour of the US Capitol building with Rep. Frost being his guide. The streamer in the video circulating all around on social media can be seen walking Capitol building hallways. He was also seen listening to congressmen who discussed some key issues that he has been working on, including student debt.Continuing his tour, the entire event took a turn as Speed’s humorous and chaotic energy-loving fans gathered around the building. The entire crowd was seen chanting IShowMeat, the long-running meme that was aimed at the streamer.Trying to get control over the crowd, Speed tried to calm them, saying,However, he failed. He even tried to give a speech, but the chants were loud enough to suppress his message.

Showcasing China’s military strength in Beijing alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un , President Xi Jinping sent a pointed message to Donald Trump , declaring that “China is never intimidated by any bullies.”The leader of the world’s second-largest economy also affirmed the country’s ascent, stating that “China’s rise is unstoppable,” in a clear signal directed at the United States.Addressing a crowd of more than 50,000 at Tiananmen Square, Xi warned that “today, mankind is faced with the choice of peace or war, dialogue or confrontation, win-win or zero-sum,” adding that the Chinese people “firmly stand on the right side of history.”Riding in an open-top limousine, Xi Jinping inspected troops and cutting-edge military hardware, including missiles, tanks and drones. Overhead, helicopters carried large banners while fighter jets flew in formation.The 70-minute display culminated with the release of 80,000 peace doves and colourful balloons -- a spectacle heavy with symbolism and propaganda.The event drew about two dozen foreign leaders seeking closer ties with Beijing amid escalating tariff tensions with the United States.Among the most closely watched attendees were Putin, Kim, and Iran’s president, along with leaders from Southeast Asia.In a striking image, Putin and Kim flanked Xi at the start of the ceremony, the first time the trio has been pictured together, in what appeared to be a direct challenge to the US-led world order.Featuring more than 10,000 troops and hundreds of advanced weapons, the parade underscored China’s growing military power under Xi’s sweeping modernization drive.Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump lashed out at Beijing, accusing Xi, Putin, and Kim of conspiring against the United States. In a Truth Social post, he argued that Americans had paid a heavy price to secure China’s freedom during World War II.“The big question to be answered is whether or not President Xi of China will mention the massive amount of support and ‘blood’ that The United States of America gave to China in order to help it to secure its FREEDOM from a very unfriendly foreign invader. Many Americans died in China’s quest for Victory and Glory,” Trump wrote.“I hope that they are rightfully Honored and Remembered for their Bravery and Sacrifice! May President Xi and the wonderful people of China have a great and lasting day of celebration,” he added.Turning sharply critical, Trump concluded: “Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United States of America.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday reacted to Russian President Vladimir Putin ’s recent visit to China, accusing him of trying to shift blame for the ongoing war in Ukraine.In a post on X, Zelenskyy said Putin was “spinning tales” in China, pretending he was not responsible for the conflict. “As if someone always forces him – to fight, to kill, to drive children into shelters, to send thousands of people to storm our positions,” he wrote.Putin travelled to Tianjin in China to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit. He also participated in the military parade in Beijing marking 80 years since the end of World War II The Ukrainian leader also condemned Russia’s intensifying air attacks, saying the brazenness of Moscow’s actions were intensifying. Zelenskyy said that in just one day Russia launched 150 drones at night, more than 50 in the morning and dozens more in the evening. He added that most of the drones were Iranian-made Shaheds.He also alleged that the surge in drone strikes coincided with Putin’s diplomatic outreach in China. ""An open disregard by Russia for everything the world is doing to stop this war,"" Zelenskyy said.Zelenskyy also pointed to Moscow’s dismissal of US President Donald Trump ’s recent comments about the need for a leaders’ meeting to resolve the conflict.The Ukrainian president further warned of a buildup of Russian forces on parts of the frontline and vowed that Kyiv would respond, including through what he described as “asymmetrical” measures to make Moscow feel the consequences of its actions. He stressed that Ukraine would continue working with its international partners to step up pressure on Russia.The parade saw the participation of several other leaders, including North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian .

Party head Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut told reporters that their 143 lawmakers were likely to give Anutin majority support in parliament, but the backing was conditional.The party demanded that parliament be dissolved within four months for fresh elections to return power to the people as soon as possible.Anutin, heir to a construction engineering fortune, previously served as deputy prime minister, interior minister and health minister. In 2022, he delivered on a campaign promise to legalise cannabis.During his tenure overseeing Thailand’s Covid-19 response, he faced criticism for accusing Westerners of spreading the virus and later issued an apology.The People’s Party, which succeeded the Move Forward party, the winner of the most seats in the 2023 polls has campaigned to reduce military influence and reform Thailand’s strict lese-majeste laws.",Acting PM Phumtham Wechayachai has moved to dissolve parliament.

Yaron Samid, an Israeli-American technology entrepreneur, has criticised Coldplay lead singer Chris Martin for remarks made during a concert at Wembley Stadium in London on Sunday.During the show, Martin invited two women, Avia and Tal, onstage. When they said they were from Israel, part of the audience responded with boos, while others cheered.Martin appeared uncomfortable but addressed the audience, saying he was treating them “as equal humans on earth, regardless of where you come from or don’t come from.”He also added, “Although it’s controversial maybe, I also want to welcome people in the audience from Palestine because… out of the belief that we’re all equal humans.”Samid said that he and his wife, both Israeli, have been devoted Coldplay fans for over 20 years, travelling globally to see the band live. But the recent comment by Chris Martin, he wrote, was “especially hurtful” and a “tactless misstep” that wounded some of the band’s most loyal supporters.Samid said Martin, who he has long seen as a kind person using music to unite people, seemed to show “growing prejudice against Israeli people.” He highlighted the suffering of Israelis caught in conflicts, noting that many have endured brutal violence and continue to face hardships.He further urged Martin to reflect quietly on his words. “You’re better than this.

Trump TAKES A SWIPE at Biden’s Stumbles; Troops Burst Out Laughing During Visit





US president Donald Trump has a low approval rating, according to recent surveys by Gallup, Reuters/Ipsos and other pollsters.More than seven months into his presidency, the numbers show continued low approval, with Americans divided over his handling of the economy, immigration and the deployment of troops in Washington DC.Gallup’s August survey reported that 40% of Americans approve of Trump’s performance, while 56% disapprove. RealClearPolitics put his net approval margin at minus five points at the end of August, and The New York Times tracker showed minus eight.These figures keep Trump below the first-year ratings of earlier presidents such as Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Ronald Reagan. Public approval stood at 49% for Joe Biden in August 2021, 36% for Donald Trump in August 2017, 53% for Barack Obama in August 2009, and 56% for George W Bush in August 2001. The highest in the list was George HW Bush, who recorded a massive 69% in August 1989.Public opinion has also been negative on key policy areas. A Reuters/Ipsos poll found only 38% of Americans supported his move to deploy the National Guard in Washington, while 46% opposed it. His immigration policies had 43% approval, and only 37% supported his handling of the economy.Trade has been another sticking point.

Protesters marched in several US cities on Labour Day, criticising president Donald Trump's policies. Hundreds of events were organised by labour groups, local activists and opposition Democratic Party officials.In New York, crowds gathered outside Trump Tower, chanting “Trump must go now” and carrying signs denouncing what they called a fascist regime. Trump has not lived in the building for years, but it continues to be a rallying point for demonstrations.Similar protests were held outside Trump Tower in Chicago, where chants included “No National Guard” and “Lock him up.”Large gatherings also took place in Washington DC, San Francisco and other West Coast cities. In Washington, protesters carried signs reading “Stop the ICE invasion” and “Free DC No masked thugs.” Along the West Coast, from San Diego to Seattle, rallies focused on immigrant rights, and low wages.In Chicago, where Trump has discussed deploying National Guard troops to address street crime, multiple groups joined together to hear speeches.Evanston mayor Daniel Biss told the crowd, “We’re here because our core values and our democracy are under attack.They are threatening to send the military into our streets.”A brief confrontation broke out when a woman shouted support for Trump and the protesters responded with shouts of their own until the woman left a few minutes later.Union members and worker rights groups also marched in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Portland.The Labour Day demonstrations added to a series of recent protests, including the “May Day” rallies on May 1, the “No Kings” marches in June and last month’s demonstrations against Trump’s plan to redraw congressional districts.","Hundreds of events were organised by labour groups, local activists and opposition Democratic Party officials.

It seems like Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's recent outreach to Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin in China's Tianjin has rattled some corners of the American right wing, with prominent MAGA commentators taking to X to criticise India.American television presenter Laura Ingraham and conservative influencer Charlie Kirk were among those lashing out, with posts targeting PM Modi and India's role in US trade and visas.Ingraham, retweeting a photo of PM Modi with Xi and Putin, called the gesture ""insane,"" and went on to complain that any US-India trade deal would require more visas for Indians.""It’s insane that Modi apparently thinks this sort of thing will make the Americans treat him better,"" she wrote.""Don’t forget that any trade deal with India will require us to give them more visas.

Pentagon approves 600 military lawyers to serve as temp immigration judges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pentagon-approves-600-military-lawyers-to-serve-as-temp-immigration-judges/articleshow/123667504.cms,"Stephen Miller (left), Pete Hegseth, JD Vance (AP)





WASHINGTON: Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has approved sending up to 600 military lawyers to the Justice Department to serve as temporary immigration judges, according to a memo reviewed by The Associated Press.The military will begin sending groups of 150 attorneys - both military and civilians - to the Justice Department ""as soon as practicable,"" and the military services should have the first round of people identified by next week, according to the Aug. 27 memo.The effort comes as the Trump administration more regularly turns to the military as it cracks down on illegal immigration through ramped-up arrests and deportations. Its growing role in the push includes troops patrolling the U.S.-Mexico border, National Guard members being sent into U.S. cities to support immigration enforcement efforts, housing people awaiting deportation on military bases and using military aircraft to carry out deportations.The administration's focus on illegal immigration has added strain to the immigration courts, which were already dealing with a massive backlog of roughly 3.5 million cases that has ballooned in recent years.Numerous immigration judges have been fired At the same time, more than 100 immigration judges have been fired or left voluntarily after taking deferred resignations offered by the Trump administration, their union says. In the most recent round of terminations, the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers said in July that at least 17 immigration judges had been fired ""without cause"" in courts across the country.That has left about 600 immigration judges, union figures show, meaning the Pentagon move would double their ranks.The Justice Department, which oversees the immigration courts, requested the assistance from the Defense Department, according to the memo sent by the Pentagon's executive secretary to his DOJ counterpart. The military lawyers' duties as immigration judges will initially last no more than 179 days but can be renewed, it said.A DOJ spokesperson referred questions about the plan to the Defense Department, where officials directed questions to the White House.A White House official said Tuesday that the administration is looking at a variety of options to help resolve the significant backlog of immigration cases, including hiring additional immigration judges. The official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity, said the matter should be ""a priority that everyone - including those waiting for adjudication - can rally around. ""Pentagon says the step may require mobilizing reserve officers The memo stressed that the additional attorneys are contingent on availability and that mobilizing reserve officers may be necessary. Plus, the document said DOJ would be responsible for ensuring that anyone sent from the Pentagon does not violate the federal prohibition on using the military as domestic law enforcement, known as the Posse Comitatus Act.The administration faced a setback on its efforts to use troops in unique ways to combat illegal immigration and crime, with a court ruling Tuesday that it ""willfully"" violated federal law by sending National Guard troops to Los Angeles in early June.It is not immediately clear what impact shifting that number of military attorneys would have on the armed forces' justice system. The attorneys, called judge advocates, have a range of duties much like civilian lawyers, from carrying out prosecutions, acting as a defense attorney or offering legal advice.Pentagon officials did immediately offer details on where any of the 600 attorneys will be drawn from and whether they will come from active duty or the reserves.The training that goes into being an immigration judge Until she was abruptly fired in July, former supervising judge Jennifer Peyton administered the intensive training that all judges in Chicago undergo before working in some of the busiest immigration courts in the country. After the weekslong training, new judges are paired with an experienced mentor and have a two-year probationary period.Peyton doubted that military attorneys would be able to master the complexities of immigration law without that rigorous process. She also said it wasn't clear how they would handle the hundreds, or sometimes thousands, of cases on just a Chicago immigration judge's docket each year.""Six months is barely enough time to start to figure out the firehose of information and training,"" she said.Peyton also was concerned that Trump's move didn't supply more administrative workers, including translators, whom judges rely on to make decisions. The stakes, she said, were life or death for people who would come before the new judges.""None of it makes sense unless you were intentionally trying to weaken the immigration courts,"" Peyton said.",Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has approved sending up to 600 military lawyers to the Justice Department to serve as temporary immigration judges. The effort comes as the Trump administration more regularly turns to the military as it cracks down on illegal immigration. The military lawyers' duties as immigration judges will initially last no more than 179 days but can be renewed.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123667516,imgsize-2170944,width-400,resizemode-4/stephen-miller-left-pete-hegseth-jd-vance-ap.jpg"

Cardi B cleared of assault allegations in civil trial

The case:





A jury on Tuesday cleared rapper Cardi B of all allegations in a lawsuit filed by a security guard who claimed she was assaulted by the rapper at a doctor’s office in 2018.The case was brought by Emani Ellis, who said Cardi scratched her face with a fingernail and spat on her during an argument at a Beverly Hills obstetrician’s office when the rapper was secretly pregnant with her first child.Only nine jurors were needed for a verdict in the civil case, but all 12 agreed Cardi was not liable.Outside court, Cardi celebrated the win, calling the case “frivolous” and warning she would countersue anyone who tries similar lawsuits. She said she had to miss her children’s first day of school because of the trial.""I am not that celeb that you sue, and you think is going to settle. I'm not gonna settle. Especially when I'm super completely innocent,"" she said.During testimony, Cardi admitted she argued with Ellis but denied touching her. “I will say it on my deathbed. I did not touch that woman,” she told reporters.Ellis argued that the incident left her scarred and cost her both her job and future career prospects. She sought damages for medical bills, emotional suffering and lost wages. Her lawyer said they plan to appeal.The trial, spread over several days, drew wide attention online, with livestreamed testimony going viral.At one point, Cardi even joked about her wig changes during the proceedings.Cardi told the court that she was in Los Angeles in February 2018 for promotional work around the NBA All-Star Game.At the time, she was four months pregnant with her first child with rapper Offset. While her close friends knew, she had not shared the news with her parents or the public.The doctor’s office had been kept shut to other patients that day to protect her privacy.She said security guard Emani Ellis followed her to her fifth-floor appointment. Cardi recalled hearing Ellis say her name into a phone and thought she was being filmed.""I asked her, ‘Why are you recording?’ and she said, ‘Oh my bad,’ almost apologising,"" Cardi testified.But she added that the argument soon got heated. ""As we were arguing, she kept backing into me, walking into me,"" Cardi said.","The case was brought by Emani Ellis, who said Cardi scratched her face with a fingernail and spat on her during an argument at a Beverly Hills obstetrician’s office.

BREAKING: 30,000 'Epstein files' released by GOP





US House of Representatives committee released the first set of documents the investigation into notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein on Tuesday.Over 33,000 pages of records were uploaded to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform website. The documents were handed over by the Justice Department.Committee chairman James Comer said, ""We're in the process of uploading those documents for full transparency so everyone in America can see them. It's going as quick as we can get them uploaded. We want those to be public as soon as possible.""The committee asked the Justice Department for these records, and the first set was given last month. It is not yet clear what new information is in Tuesday’s release, according to news agency AFP. Many documents related to the Epstein investigation have already been made public.The committee said it expects more records from the Justice Department. These will be redacted to protect victims’ identities and remove any child sexual abuse material.Epstein, a wealthy financier with influential connections, died in a New York jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on charges of sex trafficking underage girls.The investigation by the committee into Epstein follows weeks of backlash against president Trump and his administration, who were criticised by supporters and critics alike for not releasing additional Epstein documents, despite Trump’s pledge for more transparency.The sudden release also comes as Republican leaders try to contain unrest within the party, while Rep RO Khanna and Rep Thomas Massie push for a floor vote on their bipartisan bill demanding the full release of Epstein files.","Over 33,000 pages of records were uploaded to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform website.

Venezuelan government responds







President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced that US forces killed 11 “narcoterrorists” while carrying out a strike on a drug-carrying vessel linked to Venezuelan gangs. Trump alleged the gang was controlled by Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro.""Earlier this morning, on my Orders, US Military Forces conducted a kinetic strike against positively identified Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social, while sharing footage of the attack.""The strike occurred while the terrorists were at sea in International waters transporting illegal narcotics, heading to the United States. The strike resulted in 11 terrorists killed in action. No US Forces were harmed in this strike,” he said.The strike is part of broader US counter-narcotics efforts to strengthen maritime operations off Venezuela and combat threats from Latin American drug cartels. While thousands of US personnel are being deployed, officials have not indicated any plans for a land incursion into Venezuela.“Please let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America,” Trump added.Earlier on Wednesday while speaking at the Oval Office, Trump described the operation as part of ongoing counter-narcotics efforts in the southern Caribbean.“The US forces shot out a boat… a drug-carrying boat, lots of drugs in that boat,” he said. “So we took it out.”Secretary of state Marco Rubio also addressed the operation on X, calling it a lethal strike and noting that the vessel was operated by a “designated narco-terrorist organisation.” Rubio made the comments shortly before departing for Mexico and Ecuador to discuss drug cartels, regional security, and trade issues.Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro responded by deploying troops along the coast and the border with Colombia and urged citizens to join a civilian militia. Maduro has repeatedly claimed that the US is exaggerating Venezuela’s role in drug trafficking to remove him from power.He and other government officials have cited a United Nations report indicating that traffickers move only a small fraction of Colombia’s cocaine through Venezuela.On Monday, Maduro told reporters he “would constitutionally declare a republic in arms” if Venezuela were attacked by US forces deployed in the Caribbean.The Venezuelan government’s press office did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Trump’s announcement, and the Pentagon also declined to provide a statement.The latest UN World Drug Report shows that South American countries, including Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, reported increased cocaine seizures in 2022 compared with 2021, but Venezuela is not highlighted as a central hub of trafficking.",US President Donald Trump announced that US forces killed 11 “narcoterrorists” while carrying out a strike on a drug-carrying vessel linked to Venezuelan gangs.

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday reacted to a viral AI-generated video that charts his life from childhood to a projected return to the White House, calling it “a little bit scary.”Addressing the video during his Oval Office announcement, Trump said, “I saw something as I was growing up from the time I was a baby till now. I said, 'Who did that?' It was AI-generated. So it's a little bit scary, to be honest with you.”He referenced the video while talking about the viral clip showing objects being thrown outside the White House, dismissing it as fabricated, “If something happens really bad, just blame AI, but also they create things so it works both ways. But it’s true though, I see so many phony things.”The widely shared video on X begins with Trump as a child in 1949 and highlights key moments in his early life, including his time at New York Military School in 1964 and his graduation from Wharton Business School in 1968.It then moves on to his business milestones, showing him taking control of the Trump Organization in 1971, opening Trump Tower in New York City in 1983, and publishing The Art of the Deal in 1986. The AI-generated timeline also features his media presence, including appearances on Saturday Night Live in 2002 and the launch of The Apprentice in 2004.The video later shifts to his political career, showing his 2016 presidential election victory and concluding with a projection that he will become the 47th US president in 2025.The AI-generated video has sparked mixed reactions online. One X user joked, ""Now I finally know which way he parts his hair…"" while others debated the accuracy and implications of the depiction.","The widely shared video on X begins with Trump as a child in 1949 and highlights key moments in his early life.

Governor, mayor push back

Judge warns of ‘national police force’

Protests and political fallout





US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he will deploy National Guard troops to Chicago, describing the city as a “hellhole” plagued by gun violence.“We’re going in,” Trump told reporters, while suggesting Baltimore could be next. He rejected claims that he is targeting Democratic-run cities, insisting, “This isn’t a political thing. I have an obligation.”Citing Chicago crime data, Trump said, “When 20 people are killed over the last two and a half weeks and 75 are shot with bullets, I have an obligation.”Trump, who has already ordered Guard troops into Washington, DC, and Los Angeles in recent months, escalated his rhetoric on Truth Social, calling Chicago “the worst and most dangerous city in the World, by far.” He also blasted Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, writing, “He needs help badly, he just doesn’t know it yet,” before posting in all caps: “CHICAGO IS THE MURDER CAPITAL OF THE WORLD!”Gov. Pritzker accused Trump of preparing “an invasion,” while Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson declared at a Labor Day rally: “No federal troops in the city of Chicago! No militarized force in the city of Chicago!” Johnson vowed to rally national opposition against the plan.Trump’s latest comments came hours after a federal judge in San Francisco ruled his earlier use of the military in Los Angeles violated the law. District Judge Charles Breyer barred National Guard reservists and Marines from performing police duties and cautioned that Trump appeared intent on “creating a national police force with the President as its chief.”The injunction takes effect on September 12, leaving a window for the conservative-leaning Supreme Court to intervene.As Chicago residents braced for possible troop deployment, protesters marched through the city in a “Workers over Billionaires” rally, voicing anger over Trump’s plans. Local leaders warned the move could heighten tensions rather than curb violence.","US President Donald Trump said he will deploy National Guard troops to Chicago.

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday laughed off wild social media speculation about his health, and even his supposed death, after several days away from the cameras.The 79-year-old Republican, famous for his love of publicity, had not scheduled public events or press briefings for nearly a week.The unusual silence, paired with his age and recent images showing a bruised hand and swollen ankles, sent rumor mills into overdrive. Some users on X even claimed the White House was hiding his death.“I didn’t see that,” Trump said when Fox News’ Peter Doocy jokingly asked him, “How did you find out over the weekend that you were dead?” Trump smirked, replying: “That’s fake news. I didn’t do anything for two days and they say, ‘there must be something wrong with him.’ Biden wouldn’t do anything for months…”The White House has previously addressed Trump’s health concerns.In July, officials said discoloration on his hand came from “tissue irritation from frequent handshaking” and aspirin use for cardiovascular care.His swollen ankles were linked to chronic venous insufficiency, a benign condition caused by weakened leg veins. His physician, Dr Sean Barbabella, reassured in a letter that Trump “remains in excellent health.”Trump has long bragged about his stamina, even once sharing a meme portraying himself as Superman. But with the two oldest presidents in US history, Biden at 82 when he left office and Trump now 79, health rumors are under heavier scrutiny than ever.","The 79-year-old Republican had not scheduled public events or press briefings for nearly a week.

He described Venezuelans as “warriors” ready for “maximum rebellion” against any incursion, while also appealing to Trump’s stated desire to end wars rather than start them.Maduro even invoked the Nobel Peace Prize, alluding to Trump’s past interest in the award, warning that Rubio ""wants the last name Trump to be stained with blood for centuries.""The comments come amid a major US military buildup in the Caribbean. In late August, Washington deployed guided-missile destroyers and other warships with 4,500 sailors and 2,200 Marines near Venezuelan waters, officially to combat drug trafficking Rubio has described Maduro’s government as a “narco-terror cartel” and said US forces were ""truly on the offense"" against cartels sending drugs north. But critics have questioned the scale of the buildup.Jimmy Story, a former US ambassador to Venezuela, compared the strategy to “using a blowtorch to cook an egg.”Despite fiery rhetoric, Maduro acknowledged ongoing backchannel contacts with Washington, one involving Richard Grenell, a special envoy, and another through John McNamara, the top US diplomat to Venezuela reporting to Rubio. While admitting relations are in “bad shape,” Maduro expressed hope they could be repaired, calling Trump “an intelligent, bold man. He’ll know what to do.”Maduro said the naval buildup represented “the greatest threat that has been seen on our continent in the last 100 years” and claimed US ships carried “1,200 missiles” targeting Venezuela. Still, he signaled he would not suspend deportation flights returning Venezuelans from the US, noting they were part of a “bilateral relationship that has gone well.”Meanwhile, Rubio visited US Southern Command in Florida on Friday to discuss security issues and is scheduled to travel this week to Mexico and Ecuador, trips the State Department says are meant to reinforce Washington’s commitment to countering narco-terrorism and securing borders.",Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro warned that his country would respond with an “armed fight” if the United States launched a military strike.
