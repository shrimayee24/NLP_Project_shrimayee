NEW DELHI: Congress on Saturday demanded that govt “put on hold” the India-US trade deal in view of the decision of the United States Supreme Court invalidating the reciprocal tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump and “renegotiate” the terms of the deal.Congress MP Rahul Gandhi accused PM Modi of being “compromised”, alleging that his (Modi’s) “betrayal” in the trade deal now stands exposed. “He can’t renegotiate. He will surrender again.” In an X post, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge wrote: “Clueless foreign policy or one-sided surrender? Why did the Modi govt not wait for the US SC judgment on tariffs before rushing to fall into a trap deal, which extracted huge concessions from India?” Congress general secretary in-charge communications Jairam Ramesh said there was a provision in the ‘Framework of Interim Agreement’ that in case of one country modifying the terms, the other country can also do that.Referring to Trump’s statement after the SC decision the trade agreement still holds, Ramesh said Modi must say in clear terms the ‘Framework of Interim Agreement’ cannot be implemented under current circumstances.

'Won’t Spare A Single Infiltrator': Amit Shah’s Poll Promise In Assam, Slams Cong Over Infiltration

GUWAHATI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Saturday accused the opposition of turning infiltrators into a vote bank and said if BJP returns to power in Assam in the upcoming assembly elections, infiltrators will be removed from the electoral rolls and deported from the country within five years.He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi possesses the “courage, determination, and firm resolve to free the country from infiltrators”.“The support of the state govt is essential to remove infiltrators, which would never be possible if the opposition party comes to power,” he said.He further said the Election Commission is conducting the Summary Revision (SIR) to help identify infiltrators, but “the Leader of the Opposition has launched an agitation against it.” Shah said, “The country will certainly be freed from infiltrators. Under our govt, the country is becoming free from Naxalism, and in the same way, Assam and the entire nation will also become free from infiltrators.”Shah was speaking at the foundation stone-laying ceremony of the Assam Police 10th Battalion headquarters at Kachutoli near the city on the land that was freed from encroachers in 2024.“During the rule of the opposition party’s govt, infiltrators had encroached upon 174 bighas of land, which has now been freed from their possession by the present chief minister of Assam, Himanta Biswa Sarma, and today’s programme is being held on that very land,” he said.“At the very place from where security challenges had once emerged, the 10th Battalion of the Assam Police — which will eliminate those challenges — is now being established,” he said.He added that the land occupied by infiltrators had posed a major threat to Guwahati, Assam, and the entire country and the “presence of these infiltrators was a serious challenge to the development of Assam.”Shah said,“During the tenure of the previous govt, infiltrators had entered the region and pushed Assam’s demographic situation to a dangerous level.The opposition party bears direct responsibility for several areas of Assam — such as Dhubri, Barpeta, Morigaon, Darrang, Bongaigaon, and Nagaon — becoming infiltrator-dominated.”He highlighted that chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has freed nearly 1.45 lakh bighas of land from infiltrators and provided govt jobs to more than 1.4 lakh people in Assam without corruption and issued a firm pledge, “If our govt is formed again in the next five years, we will identify and deport every infiltrator from the country.”Shah alleged that infiltrators had become a vote bank for the opposition and declared, “Once our party’s govt is formed, within the next five years we will remove infiltrators not only from the electoral rolls but also from the country.”Accusing the opposition of endangering Assam’s identity, Shah said, “By allowing infiltrators to enter, the opposition party handed over Assam’s fertile land to them, which harmed the identity of the Assamese community and also put its cultural heritage at risk.”","Shah was speaking at the foundation stone-laying ceremony of the Assam Police 10th Battalion headquarters at Kachutoli near the city on the land that was freed from encroachers in 2024.

BENGALURU: Haunted by morbid thoughts of who would take care of his wife upon his death, a former Isro staffer, 76, allegedly strangled his wife to death on Wednesday morning, contemplated ending his life by suicide, but panicked and aborted the plan.Police officers probing the case said Nageshwar Rao, who retired as a team leader, is under treatment for unstated psychological issues. The incident took place in a senior living community in Bengaluru's Whitefield area, a first such case in many years.According to preliminary investigations, Rao used a bath towel to smother Sandhya Shri, 63, while she was preparing lunch in the kitchen around 10.15am in The Virtuoso in Bommenahalli. Rao has been arrested on charges of murder.The couple from Andhra Pradesh purchased the flat three years ago. Their only daughter is settled in the US. Informed by police, the daughter is flying to Bengaluru, sources said.""After the woman collapsed, Rao sat near her body for 20 minutes. He called a neighbour, asking him to come home immediately as he had killed his wife. The neighbour thought it was a joke. When Rao repeatedly said it, the neighbour rushed in,"" police said.Seeing Sandhya motionless on the floor, the neighbour called a doctor in the apartment. Since many senior citizens live in the apartment, an ambulance and a doctor are deployed round the clock.""The doctor examined Sandhya and declared her dead. Then, the doctor called police,"" an investigating officer said.When police entered the flat, Rao was sitting on the sofa and readily confessed to the incident. ""Yes, I killed her. I may not live more than 3-4 years from now. Who'll look after her after my death? We don't have close relatives in Bengaluru,"" he said.However, when a senior police officer questioned him about the motive, Rao answered the query with a blank stare.The incident has jolted police and geriatric caregivers. A cop said: ""This shocking episode comes at a time when community-living residences for senior citizens are gaining popularity in Bengaluru.""","Nageshwar Rao, 76, allegedly strangled his wife to death on Wednesday morning.

NEW DELHI: A special POCSO court in Prayagraj on Saturday directed the police to register an FIR against Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati and his disciple Swami Mukundanand Giri in connection with allegations of sexual exploitation.ADJ (POCSO Act) Vinod Kumar Chaurasia ordered the FIR registration and a detailed investigation into the matter. The case will be registered at Jhunsi police station following the court’s directions. The application under Section 173(4) was filed by Shakumbhari Peethadhishwar Ashutosh Brahmachari Maharaj, seeking strict action, news agency ANI reported.Reacting to the court order seer said, “Yes, it is appropriate. Only when a case is registered will the subsequent process of investigation and recording of testimony be completed. Only then will the truth of the false case filed against us come before everyone, and those responsible for doing this can be punished. Therefore, it is necessary. We would only say that the court should proceed with this at a faster pace without taking too much time, as many people are watching this matter.Testimony should be recorded and a decision taken as soon as possible. What is wrong will remain wrong, and the false case that has been filed will ultimately be proven false.”The move comes amid a backdrop of controversy surrounding Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati. Last month, the seer claimed he was prevented from taking a ritual dip at the Sangam during the Magh Mela in Prayagraj, leading him to stage an 11-day sit-in protest. Speaking to reporters in Varanasi, he said, “When I sat there for 11 days, no official asked me to take a dip. Now it is too late. I will go to the Magh Mela next year and take a respectful bath. ”The seer had also urged Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath to stop beef exports from the state and declare the cow as ‘Rajya Mata’, calling it a measure of the government’s commitment as a “Hindu sympathiser.”The controversy traces back to January 18, when Swami Avimukteshwaranand, travelling in a palanquin to the Sangam for Mauni Amavasya, was asked by officials to dismount and proceed on foot due to heavy crowds. The Mela administration alleged that his supporters broke a barricade on a pontoon bridge, causing crowd management issues.Following the incident, the seer protested outside the Shankaracharya camp, demanding an apology and a dignified escort for the ritual bath. The administration also issued a notice questioning his use of the title of Shankaracharya of Jyotish Peeth, citing a civil appeal pending before the Supreme Court.The row triggered political and administrative reactions. Prashant Kumar Singh, deputy commissioner in the Uttar Pradesh GST department, resigned citing moral reasons and Bareilly city magistrate Alankar Agnihotri also stepped down, highlighting concerns over the alleged insult to the seer. The Congress party announced a campaign against the perceived insult, demanding that the state governor take suo motu cognisance.","POCSO court in Prayagraj orders police to register an FIR against Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati and his disciple Swami Mukundanand Giri.

'BJP's reign of terror is ongoing in MP': Congress reacts to the protest

NEW DELHI: A clash broke out on Saturday between Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party workers during a protest by the BJP against a “shirtless” demonstration by Indian Youth Congress (IYC) members at the India AI Impact Summit.According to the video circulating on social media, the confrontation saw stone-pelting, prompting police intervention to control the situation and ensure public safety.Deputy Commissioner of Police Krishna Lalchandani said that the clash occurred near the Congress office, where the BJP protest was underway.“There were two parties involved. One party was protesting. The protest was near the Congress office. The area had been barricaded, and proper police arrangements had been ensured. Suddenly, some rumour-mongering occurred, and some stones were thrown. Then, the other side also threw stones. Some people were injured... It's too early to say who threw the first stone,” Lalchandani added.The incident follows a “shirtless” protest staged by Youth Congress workers on Friday inside the Bharat Mandapam, accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of compromising the country’s interests during the AI summit.During the demonstration, protesters removed their shirts and raised slogans, drawing attention to what they described as a political and national concern.Patiala House Court on Saturday rejected bail applications for four arrested Youth Congress workers, Krishna Hari, Kundan Yadav, Ajay Kumar, and Narasimha Yadav and sent them to police custody for five days. Police said that the custody was needed to investigate a potential larger conspiracy, including the funding and planning of the protest. Three policemen were reportedly injured during the confrontation.Delhi Police officials said that the protesters had registered online to obtain QR codes to enter the venue and initially planned to use black umbrellas with printed stickers to convey their message.“However, they later felt that the black umbrellas might draw the attention of the security personnel manning the gates, so they changed their plan and got the printed stickers placed on T-shirts instead,” a police source said.The accused reportedly engaged in a scuffle with security personnel and police staff during the protest. Investigators are also examining if the demonstration was part of a wider conspiracy linked to similar protests in Nepal.The lawyer for the accused argued that the protest was a form of political dissent and that the workers were being targeted because of their party affiliation. “Political dissent shouldn’t be crushed like this. The accused are educated office bearers exercising their right to protest peacefully,” the lawyer said.The Congress party reacting to the incident, blamed the state BJP leadership for the violence.In a post on X, the party wrote, “The BJP's reign of terror is ongoing in Madhya Pradesh. BJP goons have stormed into the state Congress office. There, these goons engaged in scuffles with Congress workers and caused widespread vandalism. All this thuggery was carried out under the patronage of the BJP government. Here, the government itself is tearing the law to shreds. Immediate action must be taken against these BJP goons. ”","A clash broke out on Saturday between Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party workers during a protest by the BJP against a “shirtless’ demonstration by Indian Youth Congress (IYC) members at the India AI Impact Summit.

Leader of a Patidar group said they want strict laws against ‘sham marriages’

'Violate ban, face boycott'

Notice

'Parents should have say'

'Love marriage no crime'

Gujarat govt’s proposal that couples must inform their parents before tying the knot is yet to become law, but ‘or - ders’ to that effect are al - ready in force in parts of Gujarat, where some villages and communities have come out with detailed ‘codes’ intended to govern how their members marry.The amendments proposed in the state assembly on Friday reflect de - mands and actions being pushed on the ground, with scattered village reso - lutions hardening into communitylevel ‘constitutions’ — resolutions and declarations that threaten couples who marry for love with boycott, ostracism, and exclusion from public life.From gram sabhas in Kheda district to caste organisations of Patidars and Thakors, the consen - sus driving such declarations is that marriage without parental consent threatens tradition, destabilises so - cial order and endangers women.The gram sabha in Nand village in Mahudha taluka recently passed a res - olution imposing total social boycott on couples who marry despite opposi - tion from their families. Such couples are barred from community facilities, religious gatherings and social func - tions. The resolution also caps wed - ding and funeral expenses, prohibits DJs and “objectionable songs”, and imposes fines for violations.Bharat Solanki, the village sar - panch, said rising cases of marriage disputes had led to the decision. “We are a village of 5,000, mostly Thakors and Darbars. There have been sagotra (intra-clan) marriages, which are not permissible. When a couple elopes, it puts parents in an embarrassing po - sition. As these incidents have been rising, we decided to declare a ban on such marriages. Violate the ban, and you face boycott. ”The rules, Solanki insisted, spare no one. All communities in the vil - lage — including OBC and SC fami - lies, which form a minority — are required to comply. “The rules are for everyone. We are not targeting one single group. Violators pay Rs 21,000 fine and are excluded from village gatherings,” he said.Similar ‘rules’ are surfacing else - where, signalling a broader social churn. Village elders argue that couples who elope — their union is known locally as ‘bhagedu lagan’ — disrupt social harmony and bring dishonour to their families.Geni Thakor, Congress MP from Banaskantha who spearheaded the Thakor community’s campaign against such unions, said “the deci - sion was taken because (they) kept seeing fraudulent marriages"".“A girl marrying outside her com - munity weakens its social fabric. There have been instances where women are deceived by men, subject - ed to abuse and, in some cases, driven to suicide. Our aim is to protect our daughters,” said Thakor, who also cit - ed demographic factors, saying “the Patidar sex ratio is collapsing”.Following the proposed amend -ments, Thakor said she “was the first to raise the issue of ‘bhagedu lagan’ when the ‘love jihad’ bill (Gujarat Free - dom of Religion (Amendment) Bill, 2021) was tabled in the assembly”. She insisted that “99% of love marriages fail and bring misery to the girl”. Asked about the basis for her claim, she said, “I have found this in villages; it might not be the case in big cities.”Among Patidars, opposition to such self-choice marriages has simmered for years. Lalji Patel, who heads the Sardar Patel Group (SPG), said the movement crystallised around paren tal anguish.“During Covid, parents came to us, begging us to rescue daughters trapped in sham marriages,” Patel said. “That is why we initiated these measures.” He said the SPG has been demand - ing that the legal age of marriage for women be raised from 18 to 21 even as he acknowledged that the Constitution allows adults to marry by choice. “But society matters. Parents are every - thing. They should have a say.”One pamphlet distributed by the Patidar Sena in Mehsana went beyond parental consent to call for sweeping changes, including par - ents’ signatures on marriage regis - tration for those aged 30 or younger. It also wanted court marriages to be restricted to the bride’s local juris - diction, 40 to be the minimum age of witnesses, and couples who marry by choice after 30 to deposit Rs 10 lakh in their parents’ accounts and forfeit any claim to family property.“These demands are born from the pain parents have gone through,” said Satish Patel, leader of the Mehsana Patidar Sena. Asked about the proposed rules, he said they were “not fully satisfied” as they also wanted “only blood relatives of girls to be signatories in the marriage registration as that ensures both parents and relatives bear full accountability for every such union”.Community leaders backing these demands insist they are not against people choosing whom they want to marry, but against secrecy and deception. “If a couple wants to marry and the parents agree, we have no objection,"" Lalji Patel said. “But parents must be involved. They’re the ones who will always shield their daughters.” He, too, said the latest proposal falls short of their demands.“The govt speaks of merely ‘informing’ parents, as though a notification is sufficient. We have demanded that parents’ consent be made mandatory.”Legal experts warn that such meas - ures strike at the core of constitu - tional freedoms but those who fall foul of such diktats say that they have to face serious difficulties in their day-to-day lives.A Dalit man from northern Gujarat who married a woman from the Darbar community in 2015 — Darbars are placed higher in the social hierarchy—said they have had to change their residence at least 50 times and stay off social media to avoid being traced. Both hold postgraduate de - grees but cannot find stable work.“We’ve not been able to work at one place. We are dependent on daily wages even though we both hold PG degrees,” the man said. “We took up jobs with NGOs, but my wife’s family members or relatives traced me there during fieldwork.”Kaushik Parmar, a lawyer from Mehsana who works with intercaste couples, slammed the proposed changes in the marriage registration rules, saying that “love marriage is not the enemy of society; it is the right of a free citizen”. “Every attempt to curb it weakens the Constitution and strengthens caste hierarchies. If we truly want a progressive, equal, and just society, we must see love marriage not as a crime but as an instrument of social change. These rules amount to the murder of democracy,” he said.",Gujarat govt’s proposal that couples must inform their parents before tying the knot is yet to become law.

NEW DELHI: The ministry of external affairs on Friday said the United Nations joint statement India signed was not a ""negotiated document"" that condemned Israel's West Bank expansion.The foreign ministry said New Delhi's stand on the expansion issue was already expressed in the India-Arab League Ministerial meeting that laid out a broader vision for deeper two-way ties, pitched for a sovereign and viable Palestine state living side-by-side with Israel.The meeting had also stressed the need for conducting international relations based on the UN charter.""The statement referred to was not a negotiated document. Our position on this particular issue was expressed in the India-Arab League Ministerial meeting joint statement,"" MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The bureaucrat's statement broadly implies that India did not participate in drafting or agreeing to that specific joint statement condemning Israel’s West Bank expansion.Therefore, it does not reflect India’s formally agreed diplomatic position.India was among more than 100 countries and international organisations that condemned Israel's ongoing efforts to consolidate control over the West Bank in a joint statement at the UN, saying such measures violated international law and undermined the ongoing efforts for peace and stability in the region.India endorsed the statement late on Wednesday, just before the deadline for joint condemnation lapsed. The statement comes ahead of PM Narendra Modi's visit to Israel next week, during which he's also likely to address the Israeli Parliament.""We strongly condemn unilateral Israeli decisions and measures aimed at expanding Israel's unlawful presence in the West Bank,"" the statement said. ""Such decisions are contrary to Israel's obligations under international law and must be immediately reversed,"" it said.It strongly opposed any form of annexation. ""We reiterate our rejection of all measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Palestinian Territory occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem,"" it added.","The foreign ministry said New Delhi's stand on the expansion issue was already expressed in the India-Arab League Ministerial meeting.

Among the first to be killed were 13-year-old Wamiq Farooq and 17-year-old Tufail Mattoo, whose deaths became rallying points for widespread demonstrations. Sharma said Omar had justified the killings of Wamiq and Tufail, claiming they were part of a “rebellion” against the then govt led by him.The LoP then invoked July 13, 1931, when 22 people were shot dead by the forces of Maharaja Hari Singh outside Srinagar jail during protests against Dogra rule. The date is widely commemorated in Kashmir as ‘Martyrs’ Day’.Those killed in 1931 were remembered as ‘martyrs’ by NC, while Wamiq, Tufail and others killed in 2010 were charged with rebellion, Sharma said, adding “we need to reflect on this”.He accused NC of exploiting “Kashmiri sentiments” after failing to deliver on economic commitments, including promises of jobs and 200 units free electricity, and alleged that govt had outsourced 24000 jobs to an unknown company. “BJP will come on roads against such clandestine recruitments,” he said.NC spokesperson Imran Nabi Dar dismissed the allegations. “It is BJP that has failed to deliver on its promise of restoring statehood,” he said. Referring to July 13, 1931, Dar said the day symbolised Kashmiri resistance against monarchy and the assertion of Kashmir’s identity. “BJP is trying to build a fake narrative around it. They are trying the same with the events of 2010 to arouse sentiments in Kashmir in their favour,” he said.","Opposition leader of opposition in the J&K assembly, Sunil Sharma, launched a political attack on Omar Abdullah govt.

Ajit Pawar Dead In Baramati Plane Crash During Emergency Landing, Maharashtra In Political Shock

NEW DELHI: NCP (SP) general secretary Rohit Pawar on Saturday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking the resignation of civil aviation minister K Ram Mohan Naidu until the inquiry into the January 28 plane crash that killed former Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar is completed. He also demanded an independent and transparent probe into the incident.In his letter to the PM Modi, a copy of which was marked to Union home minister Amit Shah, Rohit Pawar raised concerns about the air charter company VSR, which owned the ill-fated Learjet 45 aircraft and alleged possible links that need independent scrutiny, according to news agency PTI.“Serious questions have been raised about the company VSR and its links with Rammohan Naidu's party (TDP). These links must be investigated by an independent and competent authority, preferably in collaboration with international agencies,” Pawar said in the letter.Seeking the minister’s resignation, he wrote, “You have always shown respect for Ajit Dada and his contribution to the country. In this context, I request that Rammohan Naidu be asked to resign from his post until the investigation is completed. This is necessary to ensure there is no influence or interference in examining whether the DGCA was compromised in any manner in relation to VSR.”Addressing a press conference, Rohit Pawar alleged that the circumstances surrounding the crash warrant deeper examination and suggested that the possibility of conspiracy must be explored.“If we talk about conspiracies, there can be two types of conspiracies: political and commercial. We want to find out which one it is. Another thing is that if someone is supporting or protecting the VSR company, which is responsible for it, that could also be a conspiracy. So many powerful people are behind this company. DGCA officials are behind it,” he said.Calling for direct intervention by senior national leaders, he added, “But if this investigation needs to be brought to justice, only the most powerful people in India, like Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, can bring justice to Ajit Dada, because the rest of the people involved are also powerful. I request them to personally address this investigation. I'm going to send a letter addressed to PM Modi via email today. .. The Aviation Minister must resign. This is our demand.”Rohit Pawar also raised doubts about technical aspects of the crash, including the aircraft’s black box and possible causes of the fire.“We had expressed doubts about the black box. When the accident happened, there was not just one blast, there were many blasts... VSR, the company that operates the flight, has a lot of issues. They are mechanical, maintenance issues. There is an area where bags are kept, additional petrol cans were kept there, and that's what caused the fire, so this needs to be investigated,” he said.Ajit Pawar and four others were killed on the morning of January 28 when the aircraft carrying them crashed near Baramati airport in Pune district while attempting to land. The Nationalist Congress Party (SP), along with Shiv Sena (UBT) and Congress leaders, have raised questions over the incident and suggested possible foul play.","Ajit Pawar and four others were killed on the morning of January 28 when the aircraft carrying them crashed near Baramati airport in Pune district.

As Muslims across the world began observing the holy month of Ramadan on Wednesday, the usual fervour associated with the festival is highly subdued in Iran, according to Iranians living in India and western countries, reports Kalyan Das. Members of the diaspora told TOI that many families back home are grappling with grief following recent anti-regime protests and the deaths of loved ones, leading to a marked shift in how the holy month is being observed. Mohammed (who asked to be identified by his first name), an Iranian who has been living in Delhi for nearly a decade, said conversations with his family reflect deep anguish and anger. “How could we mark the month when there have been so many deaths during the recent anti-regime protests?” he said.As Muslims across the world began observing the holy month of Ramadan on Wednesday, the usual fervour associated with the festival is highly subdued in Iran, according to Iranians living in India and western countries.

It is an act of defiance to show the regime that killing protesters has not silenced dissent but inspired more to stand up peacefully. ”He added that videos shared by his relatives show families clapping and singing at grave sites. “Earlier, families would wear black and mourn. Now, many are suppressing visible sorrow and choosing symbolic gestures of resistance. Through that act, they are challenging the regime,” he said.TOI independently verified the claims and came across several such videos in which families appeared to be singing and clapping near the graves of relatives who allegedly died during the unrest.Bahaar Ghorbani, another Iranian living in India, claimed that nearly 40,000 people, including women and children, were killed during the protests. “In recent years, more people have been openly eating during fasting hours as a mark of dissent. Authorities no longer strictly act against those not observing the fast. This time, the mood is even more intense because of the mass killings. Ramadan feels different,” she said.Helma, an Iranian based in Hyderabad, pointed to economic hardship as another reason behind the subdued atmosphere. “Many people cannot afford basic food items. There is also anxiety over a possible war with the US, which people fear would worsen the situation. In such circumstances, people are struggling to focus on religious observances,” she added.In Dec last year, demonstrations broke out across several cities in Iran amid widespread unrest directed at the govt and mounting economic distress. The upheaval was described by observers as the most significant challenge to the establishment since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.The subsequent security crackdown involved the use of live ammunition against protesters.Rights groups and activists have alleged that the violence led to tens of thousands of deaths, describing it as among the deadliest episodes in the country’s modern history.","As Muslims across the world began observing the holy month of Ramadan on Wednesday, the usual fervour associated with the festival is highly subdued in Iran.

Following the threat, the MLA's security has been enhanced. The development comes close on the heels of a separate case in which Akot BJP city president Harish Tawari was allegedly threatened through Signal messaging app.According to police, Tawari first received a message on Feb 12 asking him to arrange Rs2 crore by collecting it from Akot BJP MLA Prakash Bharsakale.

Police sources said the call was received on Feb 17 at around 3pm, and the caller allegedly warned the MLA to pay the amount within two days or face severe consequences.Investigators have traced the origin of the call to California, US.Following the threat, Pathan's security has been tightened and four armed police personnel have been deployed for his protection. After the call, the MLA met Akola superintendent of police Archit Chandak and other senior officers and formally lodged a complaint.Police said Lonkar is a native of Nevri Budruk village in Akot taluka of Akola district. The fact that a BJP city office-bearer and a Congress MLA were allegedly targeted by the same network has caused serious concern within the Akola police establishment.Who is Shubham Lonkar?According to police records, Lonkar had earlier claimed responsibility for the murder of NCP leader Baba Siddique, and later for the firing incident outside the residence of filmmaker Rohit Shetty.Lonkar had earlier been arrested by Akola police, who seized three pistols and live cartridges from his possession. Investigators believe he was in contact with gangster Lawrence Bishnoi and his younger brother Anmol Bishnoi.Police said Lonkar was a key operator in a weapons-trafficking racket.

A week after the municipal election results were declared, an unusual post-poll drama is unfolding across several towns in Telangana.

An additional district and sessions court in Manjeri town of Kerala’s Malappuram district on Friday sentenced five men to life imprisonment for beating a 42-year-old person to death in Mankada village in a 2016 moral policing case.The lynching was akin to terrorism, judge Thusar M observed while pronouncing the verdict. The court had held the five men guilty under IPC sections 302 (murder), 143 (unlawful assembly), 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting armed with dangerous weapon) and 449 (house trespass to commit an offence punishable with death).The convicts were identified as Nayakath Abdul Nassar (46), his brother Sharafudheen (39), P Suhail (40), P Abdul Ghafoor (60) and P Zakkeer Hussain (49), all natives of Koottil, near Mankada. In addition to life sentence, the two brothers and Ghafoor were awarded rigorous imprisonment of five years and 11 months and a fine of Rs 15,000 each.The other two accused, who were also found guilty of destruction of evidence, were handed additional seven years and 11 months of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs 20,000 each.

The accused beat up Hussain brutally with sticks for around two hours, leaving him unconscious. The court noted the accused did not even give water to the victim, nor allowed to be taken to hospital, showing a cruel and inhuman attitude.Special public prosecutor P G Mathew said the visuals retrieved from the phones of two of the accused, who had recorded the brutal assault, turned crucial in their conviction.","The lynching was akin to terrorism, judge Thusar M observed while pronouncing the verdict.

Candace Drops 'SECRET' TPUSA Tape: Erika Kirk Heard Laughing Days After Charlie Kirk’s Killing

Witness rejects allegations and calls Candace Owens' narrative “manipulative”

Online reactions intensify pressure on Candace Owens





Commentator Candace Owens is facing intense criticism after a woman she accused of having prior knowledge of the shooting of Charlie Kirk publicly rejected the allegation. The dispute has intensified online debates surrounding conspiracy claims that surfaced in the months following Kirk’s death.Kirk was fatally shot during a September 10, 2025 event at Utah Valley University. Since then, Owens has floated multiple theories questioning the circumstances of the attack and the timeline surrounding those closest to him. Her remarks drew renewed scrutiny after an interview surfaced featuring Tracy Martin, a longtime friend of Kirk’s widow, Erika Kirk.Martin, whose daughter reportedly works for Erika Kirk, appeared in an interview shared by commentator Graham Allen. Owens had claimed Martin’s daughter felt uneasy about attending the event where the shooting occurred, suggesting possible foreknowledge.In the interview, Martin praised Erika’s character and rejected the claims outright. “Charlie knew exactly who he was marrying and God knew that Erika would be the woman she is right now.”Addressing Owens’s accusations, she added, “I think when something is taken out of context, plugged into the narrative and then ran out, I can see where people get twisted on this.”She went further, describing the framing of events as “very manipulative,” and warned that when dealing with a “conspiracy psychosis” individuals can “feed the narrative and then they are able to reframe that in any way they wanted to.”Allen promoted the exchange online, framing it as a rebuttal of what he described as false claims.The interview clips rapidly became popular on social media, and users reacted harshly to them. There were commenters who commended Martin because he was defending Erika Kirk and also going directly to the accusations, whilst others urged Owens to take back the comments.One viral post stated, “Candace slandered Erika's BFF Tracy Martin, claiming she had foreknowledge of Charlie's death. Tracy proved otherwise and asked Candace, 'how are you going to right this wrong against my family?' Candace promised to ‘instantaneously’ put a message out. SHE STILL HASN'T.”Owens has not publicly responded to the latest criticism. Meanwhile, the controversy underscores how misinformation claims and partisan media narratives continue to shape public perception of one of the most shocking political killings in recent memory.","Tracy Martin, a friend of Charlie Kirk’s widow Erika Kirk, rejected Candace Owens’ claim that she had prior knowledge of the 2025 assassination. In an interview, Martin called the narrative “manipulative” and criticized conspiracy framing. The exchange has fueled online criticism, with many urging Owens to retract her allegations.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128632202,imgsize-51442,width-400,resizemode-4/128632202.jpg"
Neal Katyal: 'I've best legal team': Indian-American lawyer Neal Katyal who argued against Trump tariffs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/ive-best-legal-team-indian-american-lawyer-who-argued-against-trump-tariffs/articleshow/128643557.cms,"Indian-American lawyer Neal Katyal

'Modi Is A Great...': Trump’s HUGE UPDATE On India-US Trade Deal Amid ‘Tariff War’ With SCOTUS

The Indian-American litigator Neal Katyal, who argued before the US Supreme Court against Donald Trump’s sweeping global tariffs, praised his team as the “best legal team in the world” after the landmark ruling struck down the measures.His reaction came after the US Supreme Court handed Trump a stinging defeat by declaring his tariffs “illegal” and questioning the president’s authority to impose such sweeping trade duties without Congress.In a post on X, the former acting US solicitor general, who served under the Barack Obama administration, Neal Katyal wrote, ""I have the best legal team in the world. Brilliant lawyers & the kindest of souls. Lucky.""Earlier, Katyal welcomed the ruling as a major blow to Trump and described it as a ""decisive victory"" for constitutional governance and the separation of powers.Katyal serves as the Paul and Patricia Saunders Professor of National Security Law at Georgetown University Law Center, said the ruling was a sweeping endorsement of the arguments made in the case, which challenged what the plaintiffs described as unconstitutional taxation by the executive branch.In his earlier statement on X, he wrote, ""Today, the US Supreme Court stood up for the rule of law and Americans everywhere.Its message was simple: Presidents are powerful, but our Constitution is more powerful still. In America, only Congress can impose taxes on the American people. The US Supreme Court gave us everything we asked for in our legal case. Everything.""""I'm grateful for the leadership of the Liberty Justice Center, and in particular for the brilliant advocacy by its chair, Sara Albrecht, who led the fight when others wouldn't and was dauntless in its defense of our constitutional order. I'm also grateful to the five small business owners who stood up against these unjust, unconstitutional taxes. By taking a stand, they have delivered crucial relief to tens of thousands of businesses and millions of consumers across the country,"" the statement read further.""Finally, I lack the words to properly thank my brilliant Milbank team, especially Colleen Roh Sinzdak and Sami Ilagan, who worked with me day and night for many months to craft the winning argument. This case has always been about the presidency, not any one president. It has always been about separation of powers, and not the politics of the moment. I'm gratified to see our Supreme Court, which has been the bedrock of our government for 250 years, protect our most fundamental values,"" the statement concluded.Katyal, a partner at global law firm Milbank LLP, has argued dozens of cases before the US Supreme Court and is widely regarded as one of the country’s leading constitutional lawyers. His work, both in academia and litigation, has focused on executive power, national security law, and constitutional checks and balances.The case, supported by the Liberty Justice Center and a group of small business owners, focused on whether the president could impose taxes without approval from Congress. By siding with the challengers, the Court reaffirmed that the power to levy taxes rests solely with Congress under Article I of the Constitution.In a 6–3 ruling on Friday, the apex court reviewed tariffs imposed under an emergency powers law, including the sweeping “reciprocal” duties Trump levied on nearly all countries. The justices held that his use of emergency authority to impose import tariffs without approval from Congress was unlawful.",Indian-American litigator Neal Katyal praised his team as the “best legal team in the world’ Katyal served as the former acting US solicitor general under the Barack Obama administration. Katyal said the ruling was a sweeping endorsement of the arguments made in the case.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128643620,imgsize-678509,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

RAJKOT: A 27-year-old Junagadh labourer and part-time YouTuber, Abjal Sida, has filed a police complaint alleging harassment, threats, and an extortion attempt by a controversial social media personality and her associates.Sida claimed the group, led by YouTuber Kirti Patel, demanded Rs 20 lakh and threatened to falsely implicate him in a criminal case, including a rape charge, after he uploaded videos criticising Patel's actions during a recent religious fair.Sida, who lives in Junagadh, said the dispute began after the recent Shivratri fair. He alleged that Kirti Patel, known for content on YouTube and Facebook, participated in a sacred bath disguised as a monk, an act he and others found disrespectful to Sanatan Dharma.Despite being Muslim, Sida said he respects Sanatan Dharma and had used his Instagram account to post videos opposing Patel's conduct.According to his complaint, the backlash was swift. Patel and her associates — Divya Savlani, her boyfriend Jashpalsinh, Hanu Chavda, and Veeram Mevada — allegedly began calling and messaging Sida on Instagram, using abusive language and demanding he remove his videos.Sida further alleged that the threats escalated into an extortion attempt.He claimed the group demanded Rs 20 lakh and warned that if he refused to pay, they would have him jailed by implicating him in a false criminal case.The harassment reportedly pushed Sida into distress. After a night of threats, he consumed phenyl at his home and again near the Jetpur railway bridge, where a woman found him and rushed him to Jetpur government hospital. He had also reportedly recorded a video of the act.Jetpur police recorded his statement at the hospital and forwarded it to Junagadh police. Based on that, a complaint was registered with Junagadh taluka police station against all the accused under Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita Sections 308(4), 308(6), 351(3), 54, and 296(b).Patel was also booked for allegedly misbehaving with a woman police constable during the fair, in a complaint filed with Bhavnath police station on Feb 17. She allegedly argued with police officers when she was asked to leave the sacred bath area after monks objected to her presence, ahead of the chief minister's visit.","Abjal Sida, 27, filed a police complaint alleging harassment, threats, and an extortion attempt by a controversial social media personality and her associates.

HYDERABAD: Telangana BJP Chief N Ramchander Rao was placed under house arrest late on Saturday night as a preventive measure ahead of his proposed visit to Kamareddy scheduled for Sunday, February 22.Speaking over the phone, Rao said, ""Police have placed me under house arrest tonight.""Tensions escalated in Kamareddy after what was described as a “ghastly attack” by alleged Congress workers on the camp office of BJP MLA Katipalli Venkata Ramana Reddy. Rao had planned to visit Banswada to meet those injured in the stone-pelting incident.On February 20 and 21, violent clashes erupted between BJP and Congress workers in Kamareddy town. The unrest was reportedly triggered by a dispute over land belonging to the Government Degree College. BJP MLA Katipalli Venkata Ramana Reddy alleged that Congress leaders were attempting to illegally sell or misuse the land, specifically naming Shabbir Ali.During protests on Saturday, a vehicle belonging to a Congress leader was overturned, and stones were allegedly thrown, resulting in injuries to several party workers and police personnel.The BJP’s Telangana unit also condemned the arrest of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) leaders who were planning to stage a protest against the alleged misconduct of Youth Congress workers during the India AI Global Summit in New Delhi.Rao accused the Congress of attempting to impose “Sharia law” and neglecting the interests of citizens. He questioned the intentions of the Congress-led government, asking whether it was willing to stand with the people.He further alleged that preventing him from meeting victims of violence sent a clear message that the government would not allow the Opposition to support affected citizens. Rao later confirmed over the phone that he had been placed under house arrest at his residence in Tarnaka.Other senior BJP leaders, including Union Minister Bandi Sanjay, have called the state government's tactics ""dictatorial"" and an attempt to cover up political failures.Telangana BJP Chief Ramchander Rao on Tuesday expressed happiness over the party's performance in the recent state civic polls, stating that for the first time it has been able to secure both mayor and deputy mayor positions in a municipal corporation.Rao emphasised that the BJP has emerged as the single largest party in Adilabad, Kamareddy, and Nizamabad, and also attacked the opposition, stressing that they came together to defeat the BJP.""For the first time in Telangana, the BJP has clinched a municipal corporation in Karimnagar, capturing both the mayor and deputy mayor posts... In most municipal parties, such as Adilabad, Kamareddy, and Nizamabad, where the BJP is the single largest party, the Congress, BRS, and AIMIM came together to defeat the BJP.

AGRA: Five members of a family, including three children, were found dead inside their locked house in Amanpur town of Uttar Pradesh's Kasganj district on Saturday evening. Police suspect a murder–suicide after preliminary examination of the scene.Shyamveer Singh, 50, a welder, his wife Ramshree, 46, daughters Prachi, 14, and Akanksha, 12, and son Girish, 10, lived near a petrol pump in Amanpur. Their neighbours alerted police after noticing that the house had remained shut for an unusually long time and spotting Shyamveer hanging inside through an iron grill.Police reached the spot around 6:30pm and cut open the door using a welding machine to enter the house. Officers found Shyamveer hanging from the ceiling, while his wife and three children lay inside the room. Senior officers, forensic experts and a dog squad examined the scene as police secured the premises and began collecting evidence.Kasganj SP Ankita Sharma said, ""We received information about the incident at 6:30pm. The house has one door in front and one at the back and both were locked from the inside. There are no signs of entry.Five bodies have been recovered, one of Shyamveer and four of his family members. All bodies have been taken into custody and necessary action is being taken.""Sharma added, ""Prima facie, it appears that Shyamveer carried out the incident and later hanged himself, but we are investigating all aspects. Ramshree has one injury on her neck, which will be examined during the post-mortem to determine the exact cause of death. We are considering every possible angle.""Police said the three children did not show visible external injury marks during the initial inspection. The bodies were sent for post-mortem examination, and officers questioned neighbours and relatives to reconstruct the events leading to the deaths. Officials said Shyamveer had been running a welding shop on rent in the area for the past five years.The incident comes days after a similar case in Mathura where a man allegedly killed his wife and three children before dying by electrocution.

NEW DELHI: The seven laddoos that Neha (35) did not eat, perhaps, saved her life. The sweets, allegedly ""prescribed"" by an occultist who claimed he was curing Neha of dizziness, have claimed at least eight lives, police say.In one week, police have contacted at least 50 people who went to Kamrudin in Loni, Ghaziabad. The occultist is now at the centre of a widening serial-killer probe.Three people were recently reported dead in Peeragarhi, allegedly poisoned. Kamruddin has also been linked to a 2014 murder and a double murder last year.Neha survived because her skeptical husband threw the supposedly ""blessed"" sweets in the trash and forbade her from eating them.Last Feb, Neha, who worked in a factory, started complaining of dizziness. The clinical tests she underwent did not show any problem. At this juncture, a family friend, Saleem, approached Neha and her husband and told them about Kamruddin's ""divine healing powers"".Neha went to Loni with her brother, unaware that they were stepping into the lair of a man who had allegedly caused at least eight deaths. The woman, from Sultanpur in Lucknow, said the occultist ""diagnosed"" her just by looking at her.""He didn't ask for my medical reports. He just looked at me and did a jhaada (a supposed cleansing ritual). Then, he pulled out a piece of paper and drew the face of a woman and a man whose head was split open. He told me I had been fed the meat of pigs and chickens as a curse. He said an ‘utaar' (cleansing) was the only way to save me.""The first ""consultation"" cost Neha Rs 2,000. Kamruddin gave her the seven ladoos, instructing her to eat one every day for a week, just like doctors prescribe medicines. ""My husband did not allow me to eat them. The occultist had given me a bottle of water to keep drinking and an egg too. But I didn't eat anything,"" Neha said.At the next visit, the fee jumped to Rs 8,000. The occultist claimed a ""spiritual surgery"" was required. ""He made me lie down and told me he would pull the curse out of my stomach. He used a white cloth, like a gamcha, and appeared to pull out blood-soaked threads and something that looked like rotting meat. The smell of dead meat was so strong I started puking. He told me the evil was leaving my body.""Kamruddin then made Neha run laps around the shrine inside his room. He also made her consume a cold drink.Neha survived. Several other victims were not so lucky, police say.","At least eight people in India have died after eating sweets allegedly prescribed by an occultist.

Karnataka exam board may prepare common question papers for std 6-9 in state syllabus govt schools,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/karnataka-exam-board-may-prepare-common-question-papers-for-std-6-9-in-state-syllabus-govt-schools/articleshow/128635892.cms,"Delhi Terror Alert, India–Brazil Rare-Earth Deal & Political Shirtless March at AI Summit & More





BENGALURU: The department of school education and literacy is proposing common question papers — prepared by Karnataka School Examination and Assessment Board — for classes 6, 7, 8 and 9 in statesyllabus govt schools from the current academic year.Till now, question papers for summative assessment-2 (or term-2 exam) were prepared at the school level. The latest move is to have a standardised question paper for these four classes. However, valuation will be done at the school level, and there will be no detentions based on results.“Instead of focusing only on class 10 and 12, interventions must be made early. We’ll attempt interventions from class 6 so that the pressure on the child eases by class 10,” said a senior official.“This is a gentle exercise to ensure students are ready for adequate learning interventions. We’ll follow Right to Education — there will be no coercion, punitive action or detention,” the official further added.Question papers will be despatched to school logins from KSEAB in the morning of the exam days. The school headmaster has to print out the papers. This practice is followed for class 10 and II PU preparatory exams.Though the department had planned a similar move for classes 5 and 8 in 2024, private schools, which were brought under the proposal, challenged the move in Supreme Court. The top court stayed the exam.Though this proposal is only for govt schools, private schools are free to sign up. “We hope to introduce it for I PU students next year,” the official said. As per the Unified District Information System of Education 2024, Karnataka has 27,000 schools offering classes 6-9.A schoolteacher said the department should send in model papers and blueprints so that schools will prepare the ground for final exams. “This will also bring in desired seriousness,” she said.","Karnataka Department of school education and literacy is proposing common question papers for classes 6, 7, 8 and 9 in statesyllabus govt schools.

MUMBAI: Two days after Borivli MLA Sanjay Upadhyay convened a meeting with the BMC commissioner and residents of Charkop over tremors reported during test piling for the Mumbai Coastal Road (North) project, civic officials on Friday conducted on-site monitoring of the affected buildings.The inspection team included civic engineers and Abhay Bhambole, a professor from Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute (VJTI), who assessed vibration levels generated during soil erosion and test pile works. Readings were taken to evaluate the impact of ongoing piling activity on nearby residential structures.During the monitoring exercise, Bhambole suggested a series of corrective measures to engineers from Larsen & Toubro, the project contractor. These included the use of specialised piling tools and deploying support machinery such as JCBs to stabilise piling rigs, with the aim to reduce excessive noise and vibrations.Officials said the readings recorded during the visit indicated minimal to negligible vibrations. Bhambole also assured residents that adequate precautions would be taken during subsequent piling activity to prevent recurrence of tremors or structural impact.The visit also addressed concerns on mangrove loss in Charkop. It was explained that only about 9,000 mangroves—out of a total of approximately 46,000 — will be temporarily trimmed and later replanted at the same location.","Civic officials conducted on-site monitoring of the affected buildings.
