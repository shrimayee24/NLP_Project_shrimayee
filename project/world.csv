The drive to Lilavati

Saif’s kurta was soaked in blood

In the early hours of Thursday morning, a routine drive turned into a critical moment for 47-year-old auto-rickshaw driver Bhajan Singh Rana . He found himself transporting Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan to Lilavati Hospital in Bandra following a stabbing incident at the actor's residence.Rana was near the Satguru Darshan building , where Saif resides, when he heard urgent calls for help. “I was driving my rickshaw and suddenly heard someone shouting, ‘Rickshaw ruko (stop the rickshaw),” Rana recalled.A woman and others flagged him down. “The person whose white kurta was soaked in blood got in the auto. I noticed he had neck and back injuries but did not see the hand injury,” he added. “At first, I thought it was a regular assault case,” he recalled.Saif, visibly injured, approached the rickshaw and entered. “He walked towards me himself and sat in the auto. He was in an injured state. A small child and one more person were with him,” said Rana.Despite stab wounds to his neck, back, and stomach, Saif remained composed. “He asked, ‘Kitna time lagega (How much time will it take to reach the hospital)?’” Rana recounted.Initially, the plan was to go to Holy Family Hospital, but the passengers decided on Lilavati Hospital instead. Rana drove swiftly, reaching the hospital in about 10 minutes. “I just took a U-turn and stopped the auto at the gate,” he said.Upon arrival, Saif revealed his identity. “It was only when we reached the hospital gate that he called the guard to fetch a stretcher, saying he was Saif Ali Khan,” said Rana.In his injured state, Saif refused to use a wheelchair. “A wheelchair was brought for him, but he refused to sit on it. Then stretchers were brought, and he lay down on one before being taken inside,” said Rana.Saif’s white kurta was soaked in blood, but he managed to walk on his own. “There were three people in total — Saif, a kid, and a young man. He seemed normal while I was taking him to the hospital,” Rana added.The journey ended around 3 am. “His white kurta turned red, and there was a lot of blood loss. Even after getting out of the rickshaw, he walked on his own. I didn’t take any fare,” he said.Rana admitted to feeling scared about the situation, fearing potential trouble. No police statement has been taken so far.","Auto-rickshaw driver Bhajan Singh Rana was transporting Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan to Lilavati Hospital in Bandra.

MUMBAI: Nearly 48 hours after the incident, the intruder who attacked actor Saif Ali Khan and his domestic staff during a burglary attempt remained untraced. Teams formed by Bandra police and Mumbai Crime Branch were yet to disclose details about the investigation when reports last came in, but Maharashtra’s minister of state for home Yogesh Kadam ruled out involvement of organised gangs.Khan, who suffered stab wounds on his spine, neck, and hands, was “doing well” post-surgery, according to doctors.He walked around and ate regular meals at the hospital on Friday. He was moved from the ICU to a special room, said doctors. Depending on progress, he may be discharged on Monday.A suspect, who resembled the person seen in the CCTV grab at Khan’s apartment in Bandra, was picked up from south Mumbai. During interrogation it was found he was a drug abuser who was home at the time of the crime. He was released on Friday afternoon.At least 20 teams have been formed so far to trace the assailant. Several, including two carpenters who had carried out furniture work in the actor’s home two days ago, were questioned. Khan’s wife Kareena Kapoor gave her statement to police on Friday. Police are also tracking mobile data to check on the presence of new numbers in the locality at the time the incident occurred.Bandra police have registered the case based on the domestic help, Eliyamma Phillip’s statement. According to Philip, she was the first to spot the intruder near the room where the actor’s son was sleeping. She made sure the child was safe before confronting the man. Her screams alerted the others. During the confrontation with the burglar, despite being stabbed with a knife, Khan managed to gather everyone behind him in the corridor and pull the door of the room to trap him inside.An investigating officer said Khan managed to gather everyone behind him in the corridor and pulled the door of the room to trap the intruder inside, but in the commotion, failed to lock the door from outside. This helped the intruder escape when Khan, his wife, their children and the staff rushed out to get help.Police are not yet conclusive about the route taken by the intruder after leaving the building. Bandra police believe he took the fire escape stairwell to reach Khan's 11th floor residence. ""There's a second image of the intruder, his face covered with a mask. It was captured on the sixth floor. And after the attack, he left by the same route. His face was not covered while leaving the building,"" said a source.The intruder's image was captured only on the stairs in the building. There are not many CCTVs in the locality. The domestic help told police that there are no CCTVs on the floor leading to the actor's flat nor any inside the flat.""His arrest will tell us how he managed to enter the flat. If he used a tool to pick the door lock or take some other route to enter the toilet,"" said police.

He said,""Saif Ali Khan is better now. We made him walk, and he walked well. Looking at his parameters, his wounds and all the other injuries, he is safe to be shifted out of the ICU. He has to take several precautions. He has to take rest and his movement has been restricted for a week.""Dr Uttamani said that he was the doctor who met Saif within the first hour of his injury. He said, ""He had blood all over. But he walked in like a lion with his young child. He is a real hero.

Police are leveraging their network of informants and scrutinising CCTV footage from the building, which showed the assailant fleeing after the attack.Mumbai Police earlier disclosed that Saif’s residence lacked surveillance cameras, leaving investigators reliant on footage from the building’s common areas. The suspect’s image was captured on CCTV as he fled via a fire escape. Authorities suspect he entered through a duct, as there were no signs of forced entry.Philip, a house help employed by the family, recounted the terrifying ordeal. She awoke to find the attacker approaching the bed of Saif’s youngest son, Jeh. Attempting to intervene, she was injured in the scuffle. The intruder demanded Rs 1 crore, threatening violence. Hearing her screams, Saif and Kareena rushed out, leading to the violent confrontation.CCTV footage captured the suspect wearing a red scarf, t-shirt, jeans, and carrying a backpack. Police have described him as a slim man in his late 30s with a dark complexion. His movements were recorded as he fled down the building’s stairwell, even looking directly at the camera at one point.The incident occurred at around 2:30 am at Saif’s 11th-floor flat in the upscale ‘Satguru Sharan’ building. According to police, the attacker confronted a maid inside the residence before a violent altercation broke out. Saif, attempting to de-escalate the situation, was stabbed multiple times. The assailant fled the scene armed with a wooden stick and a long Hexa blade, which he used during the attack.The actor was rushed to Lilavati Hospital, where he underwent emergency surgery. Doctors revealed that the attack caused a severe injury to Saif’s thoracic spinal cord, necessitating a procedure to remove a 2.5-inch knife lodged in his spine and to repair a leak in his spinal fluid. Although Saif is now out of danger, he remains under intensive care and close observation.Hours after the attack, Saif’s wife and actor Kareena Kapoor Khan described the incident as “incredibly challenging,” requesting privacy for her family.“We are still processing the events that have unfolded.

Delivering the judgment on Wednesday, Justice Urmila Joshi-Phalke discharged the accused, Vaibhav Mawale , who was charged after his former partner died by suicide in 2020.The case involved the suicide of a woman from Buldhana district , allegedly driven by the accused's decision to end their nine-year relationship. A suicide note left by the deceased detailed her emotional distress and the accused's refusal to marry her. Following this, the woman's father lodged a complaint, and a case of abetment of suicide was registered against Mawale under Section 306 IPC .The court, however, dismissed the allegations, observing evidence did not support the charge. Justice Joshi-Phalke stated the relationship ended in July 2020, while she died by suicide five months later. The judge emphasised the ""temporal gap between the two events negated any proximate connection between the accused's actions and victim's decision to take her life.""Justice Joshi-Phalke observed, ""Mere refusal to marry, even after a prolonged relationship, cannot be construed as abetment of suicide unless there's concrete evidence of instigation or intentional aid to commit the act.""The judgment clarified that emotional distress resulting from a breakup, while unfortunate, cannot automatically translate into criminal liability. The judge added that evidence indicated the woman remained in contact with the accused after their breakup, further weakening the claim of provocation.","Vaibhav Mawale was charged after his former partner died by suicide in 2020.

Bollywood on edge: A pattern of celebrity threats

Actor’s statement: 'A burglary gone wrong'

Bollywood star Saif Ali Khan was attacked in a terrifying incident by an armed intruder at his Bandra home early on Thursday morning. The intruder, armed with a knife and stick, left the actor, his staff, and his son’s nanny injured before fleeing the scene. The horrific attack took place at around 2:30 am in the upscale Satguru Sharan building, shocking the city and sparking a massive police manhunt.The horrifying sequence unfolded near the room of Khan’s four-year-old son, Jeh. Philip, Jeh’s nanny, recounted the chilling moments when she encountered the armed intruder.""I saw a thin, short man come out of the bathroom and approach Jeh’s bed,"" Philip said in her police statement. ""He pointed a finger at me and said, ‘Koi awaz nahin (Don’t make any noise).’ When I tried to intervene, he attacked me with a blade.""When she resisted, he attacked her, causing severe injuries to her hands and wrists.Despite the chaos, Philip managed to alert the family. Saif and his wife, Kareena Kapoor, rushed out of their room, only for Saif to be brutally attacked. The assailant fled down the stairs, evading security.In his attempt to protect his family, Saif confronted the intruder and sustained multiple injuries, including deep cuts to his neck, shoulder, and wrist. Staff member Geeta also suffered injuries while intervening.Saif Ali Khan was rushed to Lilavati Hospital, where doctors performed emergency surgery to remove a 2.5-inch knife lodged in his thoracic spine, as reported by ANI.Dr Niraj Uttamani, chief operating officer at the hospital, said, “The surgery went well. Saif is stable and recovering in the ICU. We expect a full recovery in the coming days.” Neurosurgeon Dr Nitin Dange added, “In addition to the spinal injury, there were deep wounds on his neck and left hand, which required plastic surgery.”Police investigators, aided by CCTV footage, discovered that the intruder had escaped via the staircase after the attack. A screen grab of the suspect’s face—wearing a brown collared shirt and red scarf—has gone viral. Sub-Inspector Suraj Irakte revealed, “The suspect appears to have entered earlier in the night and hid within the premises before launching the attack. We’ve formed ten teams to track him down.”A case has been registered under multiple sections, including armed robbery, attempted murder, and house trespass. Bandra Police, along with the Crime Branch, are actively investigating. Officials confirmed no signs of forced entry, indicating that the intruder might have exploited a security lapse.The case has prompted an extensive investigation involving 20 police teams.The attack on Saif Ali Khan has reignited concerns about celebrity safety in Mumbai . Similar incidents in recent years, including threats to Salman Khan and Shah Rukh Khan, underscore the vulnerability of even high-profile figures.Saif Ali Khan’s representatives issued a statement calling the incident a “burglary attempt.” The star remains under observation at the hospital, with his family and fans relieved that he is out of danger.","Saif Ali Khan was attacked in a terrifying incident by an armed intruder at his Bandra home early on Thursday morning.

"Pannun probe substantive, led to outcomes we desired: US envoy",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pannun-probe-substantive-led-to-outcomes-we-desired-us-envoy/articleshow/117307482.cms,"US Ambassador to India Eric Garcetti. (Photo/PTI)

After the recent tensions over the Khalistan separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun murder plot, the Biden administration looked to sign off on a positive note with India as outgoing ambassador Eric Garcetti Thursday welcomed the conclusion of the Indian probe into the murder-for-hire case, saying the investigation delivered 2 of the things that the US sought – accountability and systemic reforms .Garcetti told TOI in an interview that while the probe was not an end in itself, and the US would look forward to more steps, the outcome helped prove wrong the sceptics who believed there’s no way India and the United States would be able to navigate this issue and that what India was doing was mere “window dressing”.The ambassador admitted that Trump’s tariff threat could undermine the positive agenda of the relationship, but expressed confidence the relationship would continue to grow, saying he saw Trump’s tariff focus as an invitation for dialogue on the issue, and not as a threat to start a trade war.“My assessment is it’s ( Pannun probe ) a really positive first step. We welcome it. It delivered what the private interactions I had with Indian officials promised. We said changes should be made to ensure this doesn’t happen again and people should be held accountable. It’s not the destination though. The report would be first to say that. It says it’s recommending a process for prosecution. And just like in our system, facts come out and things happen. But this is substantive. It moves the ball forward and we look forward to steps in the future,"" said Garcetti, when asked about the outcome of the probe which suggested the plot might have been a ‘lone wolf’ operation.On Canada’s ongoing probe into similar cases and alleged Indian involvement, which it has linked to higher-ups including the Indian home minister, Garcetti said he didn’t have any knowledge about it at all. “I believe both of our countries have independent criminal justice systems, which are outside our intelligence systems and have to pursue facts that can hold up in a court of law. I don’t want to speak for Canada. I know it to be the case in America. My friends in Canada would say they have a similar system. I think often we see connections that don’t exist,’’ said the ambassador.Garcetti said the fact that Trump has close ties with PM Narendra Modi and the fact that he has appointed people considered pro-India as NSA and secretary of state augurs well for ties. He described Biden as the most pro-India president in US history and Modi as the most pro-US PM. “And when President Biden said this is the most important country to me when he asked me to take this position…I think he proved it. Things like ICET, envisioning IMEEC…or the work we are doing in Fiji, or southeast Asia or Africa is not just additive but also multiplicative. That legacy will be an amazing foundation for the Trump administration to further build on but will also stand on it as the brightest chapter,’’ he said.Trade war doesn’t help anybody, said Garcetti when asked about Trump’s threat to impose higher tariffs on India and others. “If we want to outcompete our main competitors…want to have a China plus one strategy, It’s not enough to have good intentions. We have to reduce tariffs further. We have to create a corridor that is trusted between our technologies. The way I hear it from the president-elect, it’s an invitation to sit down at the table, not a threat to start a trade war,’’ he said.On the US focus on human rights, minorities and freedom of speech, Garcetti said both India and the US needed to guard against misinformation and to ensure a sense of belonging for all, but added US wasn’t looking to teach or preach. “That’s for the Indians to determine. India says we will not comment on you and please don’t comment on us. America says we are going to comment on you, please do comment on us. We have a slight difference there. There have been moments when I have been blown away by the vibrancy of the Indian democracy. There are fair, free elections that are an example for others,’’ he said.Asked about some of the most challenging issues he faced during his tenure, including India’s ties with Russia and the murder-for-hire case, Garcetti said there was nothing the 2 sides could not overcome even though there were conversations that weren’t easy. “Sometimes we have to disagree on things. But we resolved our trade disputes. We are navigating through criminal cases – both what happened to Indian diplomats in San Francisco and in terms of what happened to American citizens like in the Pannun case. Democracies are complex, diverse populations are difficult to manage but it reminds me of America a few decades ago. If we put our minds together, there’s nothing we can’t do,’’ he said.","Outgoing ambassador Eric Garcetti welcomed the conclusion of the Indian probe into the murder-for-hire case.

Bettina is still being perceived as a casual partner

Mar-a-Lago has already lost interest in Donald Trump Jr 's new girlfriend Bettina Anderson and multiple sources close to the family are now raising alarm that Don Jr should not be around Bettina because of her 'questionable' past, Mediaite reported. The relationship is still in a budding state and it's not yet known what went wrong so quickly. A month ago, Don Jr's break up with Kimberly Guilfoyle got kind of confirmed after Donald Trump made Guilfoyle the US ambassador to Greece. It was told at that time that the family did not like Kimberly, her loud presence, her fashion sense etc. A much younger Bettina Anderson was in the good book of the family members instead. But now people are saying that Anderson's association is not good for Don Jr as she has always been known for hard partying and she had a pattern of dating wealthy men in Florida with whom she was in transactional relationships. “I told him that she’s not someone he should be around, and let him know about her past,” a friend said.Mediaite reported that Donald Trump is also concerned about the relationship and sees Bettina's presence as more of a liability than an asset. There are also whispers that she may be barred from attending the inauguration because if she attends the inauguration as Don Jr's date, her position would be cemented in the new first family.Though Bettina Anderson has been seen at Mar-a-Lago and was also there at the Republican National Convention, the family is dithering to accept her as Donald Trump Jr's new girlfriend who should be there at the inauguration.

A divide within MAGA

Three days before President-elect Donald Trump’s swearing-in, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will implement sweeping reforms to the H-1B and H-2 visa programs, aimed at modernizing processes and strengthening worker protections. The move adds fresh intrigue as Trump’s mixed history with the H-1B visa program comes under the spotlight.The updated rules, which took effect from today, streamline the approval process, enhance oversight, and increase flexibility for employers using the H-1B visa program to hire skilled foreign workers. The H-2 rule strengthens protections for temporary agricultural and nonagricultural workers, imposing new consequences for labor law violations and unfair fees.In a statement, US Citizenship and Immigration Services highlighted the goals: “Modernizing and improving the requirements for H-1B and H-2 programs ensures better integrity, oversight, and protections for workers.”Donald Trump’s comments about the H-1B program during a recent New York Post interview raised eyebrows. Describing the program as “great,” Trump admitted to heavily utilizing H-1B workers at his properties, saying, “I’ve always liked the visas... I’ve been a believer in H-1B. It’s a great program.”This sentiment marks a stark contrast to his first term, when his administration tightened restrictions on H-1B visas, citing concerns over abuse and the replacement of American workers with lower-paid foreign labor. The restrictions were further intensified during the pandemic in 2020, fueling division within his political base.The impending reforms coincide with a heated debate among Trump’s supporters. Tech magnate Elon Musk and presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy have championed expanding the H-1B program for “highly skilled workers,” drawing backlash from hardline members of Trump’s MAGA movement.As Trump prepares to take office again, the revamped visa rules could signal a shift in immigration policy, potentially balancing skilled labor needs with worker protections. With Trump’s track record on H-1B visas creating intrigue, the political implications of these reforms are likely to ripple far beyond his inauguration.","The US Department of Homeland Security will implement sweeping reforms to the H-1B and H-2 visa programs.

A step towards peace?

The Israeli cabinet on late Friday officially approved a ceasefire agreement with Hamas, a major step in achieving peace after more than 15 months of conflict in Gaza. The agreement comes after intense negotiations mediated by the United States, Egypt, and Qatar.The negotiations, held primarily in Doha, Qatar, were led by top diplomats, intelligence officials, and mediators who navigated the complex dynamics between Israel and Hamas.Here is a closer look at the central players:The head of Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency was at the forefront of Israel’s negotiation team. Barnea worked closely with Ronen Bar, head of the Shin Bet security agency, alongside military and political advisers to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. While Barnea maintained a low public profile, his leadership was instrumental in shaping Israel’s position during the talks.As the head of Shin Bet, Ronen Bar oversaw matters concerning Palestinian security prisoners, a central issue in the negotiations. Under the agreement, Israel will release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for hostages held by Hamas. Despite taking responsibility for security failures during the October 7, 2023, Hamas attacks, Bar played a key role in securing the ceasefire.President Joe Biden’s top Middle East adviser led the US delegation in the negotiations. McGurk’s extensive experience in Middle East policy proved crucial as he shuttled between key players, drafting proposals and bridging gaps between Israel and Hamas.Qatar’s prime minister and foreign minister spearheaded his country’s mediation efforts. As the host of the negotiations, Qatar’s role was pivotal in facilitating communication between the parties. Sheikh Mohammed announced that the ceasefire would take effect on Sunday, highlighting his country’s commitment to resolving the conflict.The director of Egypt’s General Intelligence Agency acted as a liaison with Hamas. Rashad’s involvement continued Egypt’s longstanding role in mediating between Israel and Palestinian groups, with Cairo set to host further talks on the agreement’s implementation.The acting head of Hamas’ political bureau took on greater responsibility following the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. Known for his negotiation skills, al-Hayya worked through Egyptian and Qatari mediators to represent Hamas’ interests.The ceasefire agreement, set to last for an initial 42 days, includes several key provisions aimed at easing tensions and addressing humanitarian concerns:Hamas will release 33 Israeli hostages, including women, children, and elderly individuals. In return, Israel will free hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, starting with a list of 95 detainees.During the ceasefire, Israeli forces will pull back from densely populated areas in Gaza to facilitate the prisoner-hostage exchange and allow displaced Palestinians to return to their homes. However, a buffer zone of up to 800 metres inside Gaza will remain under Israeli control.Mediators from Qatar, the United States, and Egypt will oversee the implementation of the agreement through a monitoring body based in Cairo.Talks for subsequent phases of the agreement will begin on the 16th day, focusing on a permanent resolution and the release of remaining hostages.While President Biden expressed hope for a “permanent end to the war,” Hamas and Israeli officials remain cautious about the deal’s long-term impact.In Gaza, residents displaced by the conflict are preparing to return home, while in Israel, families of hostages await their loved ones with a mix of joy and sorrow. As Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani stated, “We hope this will be the last page of the war.”","The Israeli cabinet approved a ceasefire agreement with Hamas on Friday.

Among the detected aircraft, 11 crossed the median line and entered Taiwan's northern and southwestern ADIZ.In recent weeks, China has been visibly boosting its ability to invade Taiwanese beaches with innovative new naval equipment. This includes the formal launching of an enormous landing helicopter assault (LHA) vessel, the likes of which no other navy in the world possesses, and mass production of floating bridge docks to assist the unloading of ships during beach landings. Both types of equipment are strong indications that China is serious about one day invading Taiwan.The Taiwan-China issue is a complex and longstanding geopolitical conflict centred on Taiwan's sovereignty. Taiwan, officially known as the Republic of China (ROC), operates its own government, military, and economy, functioning as a de facto independent state.However, China considers Taiwan a breakaway province and insists on the ""One China"" policy, which asserts that there is only one China, with Beijing as its capital.This has fuelled decades of tension, especially since the Chinese Civil War (1945-1949), when the ROC government retreated to Taiwan after the Communist Party, led by Mao Zedong, took control of mainland China.Beijing has consistently expressed its goal of reunification with Taiwan, using diplomatic, economic, and military pressure to isolate Taiwan internationally. Meanwhile, Taiwan, supported by a significant portion of its population, continues to maintain its independence.","Taiwan detected 17 aircraft and six naval vessels of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) operating around the island as of 6 am (UTC+8) today.

In a significant development early Saturday, Israel's Cabinet endorsed a ceasefire agreement for Gaza, which would secure the release of numerous hostages and temporarily halt the 15-month conflict with Hamas. This marks a potential turning point in their most devastating confrontation to date.Despite Qatar and the US announcing the ceasefire on Wednesday, the agreement faced delays due to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu citing last-minute complications with Hamas.The second ceasefire of this war will commence Sunday, though uncertainty remains regarding the identities of the 33 hostages scheduled for release during the initial six-week phase and their survival status.The Cabinet's decision to meet beyond the start of the Jewish Sabbath highlighted the crucial nature of these discussions. Traditional Jewish law typically restricts government activities during Sabbath except for life-threatening emergencies.Netanyahu has directed a specialised team to prepare for the hostages' return from Gaza, with affected families receiving confirmation of the agreement.The agreement includes the release of numerous Palestinian detainees and promises increased humanitarian assistance to the severely damaged Gaza region.Israel's justice ministry has released details of 95 Palestinian prisoners set for release in the first phase, scheduled after 4 pm local time Sunday, comprising only young people and women.The Israeli Prison Services will manage prisoner transportation, replacing the International Committee of the Red Cross's previous role, to prevent celebratory demonstrations. The listed prisoners face charges ranging from incitement to attempted murder.Aid convoys assembled Friday at Egypt's Rafah border crossing to Gaza. Officials from both sides, speaking anonymously, confirmed Israeli military and Shin Bet representatives arrived in Cairo to discuss border operations.The agreement's first phase includes Israeli forces withdrawing from various Gaza areas, allowing numerous Palestinians to return to their remaining structures.The military stated that while forces gradually withdraw, residents cannot access areas with troop presence or near the Israel-Gaza border, warning that threats to Israeli forces will receive strong responses.The conflict began with Hamas's October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, resulting in approximately 1,200 deaths and 250 hostages, with nearly 100 still captive.Israel's retaliatory campaign has resulted in over 46,000 Palestinian casualties, according to local health authorities, who report that women and children constitute more than half the fatalities, without distinguishing between civilians and militants.","Israel's Cabinet has approved a ceasefire for Gaza, leading to the release of hostages and a pause in the 15-month conflict with Hamas.

South Korea's impeached president Yoon Suk Yeol will appear at a hearing in a Seoul court on Saturday to oppose his formal arrest over last month's imposition of martial law, according to his lawyers.Yoon, detained since Wednesday following a large-scale police operation at his home, could face rebellion charges. These charges stem from his December 3 martial law declaration, triggering the nation's gravest political turmoil since its democratic transition in the late 1980s.The corruption investigation office for high-ranking officials, leading a joint investigation with police and the military, requested the Seoul Western District Court to grant a warrant for Yoon's formal arrest.At a hearing set for 2 pm (local time), Yoon is expected to argue against the need for his custody during the investigation. The judge is anticipated to make a decision by late Saturday or early Sunday.Outside the courthouse, a gathering of Yoon's supporters demonstrated throughout the night, demanding his release.Should the arrest warrant be granted, investigators may hold Yoon for up to 20 days whilst preparing to transfer the case to prosecutors for indictment. A rejection of the warrant would result in Yoon's release and return home.The crisis began when Yoon, in an attempt to break through legislative gridlock, imposed military rule and sent troops to the National Assembly and election offices. The standoff lasted only hours after lawmakers who managed to get through a blockade voted to lift the measure. On December 14, the opposition-dominated assembly voted to impeach him.","South Korea's impeached president Yoon Suk Yeol will appear at a hearing in a Seoul court on Saturday to oppose his formal arrest.

Poll Are Trade Wars Justifiable to Protect National Interests? No Yes

Business and labour groups brace for Trump tariffs | Power & Politics

The looming threat of a trade war between Canada and the United States could become the most significant in decades if US President-elect Donald Trump follows through with his plans to impose 25% tariffs on Canadian imports, according to Canadian foreign minister Melanie Joly.Speaking at a press conference in Washington on Friday, Joly described the potential conflict as a ""trade war"" initiated by the US, warning that Canada is prepared to retaliate with ""Trump tax"" on the US if needed.""We are ready to put maximum pressure,"" Joly said, adding that it would be the ""biggest trade war between Canada and the US in decades"". Trump's tariff threat that also targeted Mexico and China would have severe consequences, particularly for Canadian consumers and jobs, a sentiment echoed by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.Trudeau, who has stressed Canada's desire to avoid a trade war, confirmed that the country is prepared for a ""strong and unequivocal"" response. ""Nothing is off the table,"" he said, adding that retaliatory measures would be designed to ensure fairness across Canada. These measures could include tariffs on various American goods, including steel products, glassware, and even Florida orange juice, according to reports by news agency AFP.The Canadian government is also looking at the possibility of halting energy exports, a proposal which has sparked debate. Alberta’s Premier Danielle Smith has opposed the move. Meanwhile, Ontario Premier Doug Ford has called for a unified Canadian response, stressing that Trump's actions affect all Canadians, not just specific regions.The economic ramifications of a trade war could be severe. Experts have suggested that Canadian GDP could fall by over five percent, and inflation and unemployment rates could rise significantly. The US-Canada trade relationship is vital, with nearly $3.6 billion in goods and services crossing the border daily, and Canada being the largest export destination for 36 US states.As the US president-elect prepares for his inauguration, his stance on trade has drawn sharp criticism. Trump's repeated assertion that Canada could become the 51st state has been met with firm resistance from Canadian leaders. Jagmeet Singh, leader of Canada’s New Democratic Party, described Trump as a “clear threat” to Canada’s economy and workforce. Singh warned that Trump’s tariff threats would worsen the cost of living in Canada, already a concern for many citizens.Singh has also called for strong measures, including cutting off the supply of critical minerals to the US, which he argues would be an effective way to force Trump to reconsider his position. ""If he wants to pick a fight with Canada, we have to make sure it’s clear that it’s going to hurt Americans as well,"" Singh said.","US President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to impose 25% tariffs on Canadian imports.

TikTok CEO Shou Chew thanked President-elect Donald Trump on Friday for supporting the company's efforts to remain available in the US. This came just hours after the Supreme Court upheld a law banning the app.In his first public statement since the ruling, posted on TikTok, Chew said, ""I want to thank President Trump for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States.This is a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship.""Chew noted Trump's understanding of the platform, stating, ""We are grateful and pleased to have the support of a president who truly understands our platform — one who has used TikTok to express his own thoughts and perspectives, connecting with the world and generating more than 60 billion views of his content in the process.""He further expressed gratitude towards the American users he added, ""To all American users, thank you for making our TikTok community such a rich and vibrant space for surprising and delighting us every day. Rest assured, we will do everything in our power to ensure our platform thrives as your online home for limitless creativity and discovery, as well as a source of inspiration and joy for years to come. Thank you. More to come.""The message came soon after the Supreme Court on Friday unanimously upheld the ban on TikTok, set to take effect Sunday unless the app is sold by its China-based parent company. The court ruled that the national security risks linked to TikTok's connections with China outweigh concerns about restricting free speech for the app's 170 million US users.Meanwhile, tThe Biden administration had announced it would defer enforcement of the TikTok ban to the incoming Trump administration, potentially allowing the app to continue operating until Trump decides how to handle the situation.Trump, who unsuccessfully tried to ban TikTok during his first term, joined the app during his 2024 campaign and vowed to ""save TikTok."" However, in a statement on Truth Social following the Supreme Court decision, he remained noncommittal, saying he needs time to review the situation. He said, ""The Supreme Court decision was expected, and everyone must respect it. My decision on TikTok will be made in the not too distant future, but I must have time to review the situation. Stay tuned!""Chew, who met with Trump in December, is expected to attend the inauguration on Monday alongside other tech executives. TikTok has not disclosed its plans for Sunday when the law goes into effect, but reports suggest the app may ""go dark"" as a last resort.The ban could be enforced by fining companies that facilitate TikTok's existence in the US, such as Apple and Oracle, which have yet to comment on their plans following the court's decision.",TikTok CEO Shou Chew thanked President-elect Donald Trump on Friday for supporting the company's efforts to remain available in the US.

Robert F Kennedy Jr, President-elect Donald Trump 's choice to lead the nation's health agencies, asked the Food and Drug Administration to revoke the authorization of all Covid-19 vaccines in May 2021, according to a recent report of New York Times. At the time, it had been around six months of the vaccine rollout and the pandemic was still deadly, with thousands of Americans dying every week.This action came merely six months after Trump had praised the COVID vaccines as miraculous. During Kennedy's petition submission, 50% of American adults were being vaccinated, with educational institutions resuming operations and religious gatherings recommencing.Kennedy filed the petition on behalf of his nonprofit, Children's Health Defense, claiming that the risks of the vaccines outweighed the benefits and that alternative treatments were available. The petition received little notice and was denied by the agency within months.Public health experts expressed shock at Kennedy's request. John Moore, a professor of immunology at Weill Cornell Medical College, called it ""an appalling error of judgment."" Gregg Gonsalves, an epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health, likened having Kennedy lead the federal health agencies to ""putting a flat earther in charge of Nasa.""Dr. Robert Califf, commissioner of the FDA, described Kennedy's effort to halt the use of Covid vaccines as a ""massive error.""When asked about his opposition to Covid vaccines in November, Kennedy said he was concerned that the vaccines did not prevent transmission of the virus. ""I wouldn't have directly blocked it,"" he said. ""I would have made sure that we had the best science, and there was no effort to do that at that time."" Robert Kennedy Jr has voiced scepticism regarding vaccine safety and effectiveness multiple times. His public profile includes outspoken resistance to Covid-19 control measures, whilst maintaining contentious positions about purported connections between vaccines and autism, a theory which has not been proven scientifically.If Kennedy is confirmed as secretary of health and human services, the former presidential candidate and later Trump endorser will lead a department controlling vast financial resources and crucial healthcare oversight. The agency's responsibilities encompass the regulation of America's food supply, pharmaceutical products, vaccination programmes and therapeutic interventions.","Robert F Kennedy Jr, President-elect Donald Trump's choice to lead the nation's health agencies, asked the Food and Drug Administration to revoke the authorization of all Covid-19 vaccines in May 2021.

SC upholds law banning TikTok in US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/sc-upholds-law-banning-tiktok-in-us/articleshow/117345078.cms,"The Supreme Court upheld on Friday a law banning TikTok in the US on national security grounds if its Chinese parent company ByteDance does not sell the short-video app by Sunday, as the justices in a 9-0 decision declined to rescue a platform used by about half of all Americans.The justices ruled that the law, passed by an overwhelming bipartisan majority in Congress last year and signed by Democratic President Joe Biden, did not violate the US Constitution’s First Amendment protection against govt abridgment of free speech. The justices affirmed a lower court’s decision that had upheld the measure after it was challenged by TikTok, ByteDance and some of the app’s users.“There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement and source of community.But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok’s data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary,” the court said in the unsigned opinion.A statement issued by the White House suggested that Biden would not take any action to save TikTok before the law’s Sunday deadline for divestiture. Republican Donald Trump, who opposed a TikTok ban, succeeds Biden on Monday.The court’s unanimity underscored the acceptance by the justices of the national security risks that Biden’s administration cited concerning TikTok, the court said, blunting apprehensions over free speech infringements.“TikTok’s scale and susceptibility to foreign adversary control, together with the vast swaths of sensitive data the platform collects, justify differential treatment to address the government’s national security concerns,” the court said in the opinion.White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre in a statement reiterated Biden’s position that “TikTok should remain available to Americans, but simply under American ownership or other ownership that addresses the national security concerns identified by Congress in developing this law.” Given the timing, Jean-Pierre added, action to implement the law “must fall to the next administration.”TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew will attend Trump’s inauguration on Monday, seated among other high-profile invitees. TikTok plans to shut US operations of the app on Sunday barring a last-minute reprieve, people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday.

However, some others were still not convinced nitpicking the photo calling it fake or non-romantic while questioning the distance and believing the smiles were fake. Several others simply saw it as their way of quashing the divorce rumours.Speculation about a potential rift between the couple began after it was announced that Michelle would not attend the inauguration of Donald Trump on Monday, leaving Obama to attend the event alone. She also missed the state funeral of Jimmy Carter earlier this month, citing a scheduling conflict, and was later reported to be vacationing in Hawaii without her husband. The Obamas have not been frequently seen together in public since delivering speeches at the Democratic Convention five months ago.The speculation were further fueled by a body language specialist Judi James, who analysed the Obamas' public appearance in mid-December during their dinner outing in Los Angeles. She observed that Barack appeared solemn and chose to walk behind Michelle rather than beside her, with no conversation between them.The expert noted that whilst Michelle initially displayed a relaxed and cheerful demeanour on their way to the vehicle, there was a noticeable absence of mutual interaction for the photographers. Upon entering the car, Michelle's smile disappeared, and both she and Barack gazed straight ahead without engaging with each other. Michelle Obama , 61, did attend the first Trump inauguration in 2017. Her absence from Jimmy Carter's funeral raised eyebrows, particularly when Obama was seen engaging in friendly conversation with Trump at the event.Former first ladies Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush, as well as Joe and Jill Biden , are expected to attend the upcoming inauguration. While no official reason has been provided for Michelle's absence, she has been vocal about her disapproval of Trump, accusing him of racism during last year's Democratic National Convention.Also, her decision to skip the inauguration is not unprecedented, as Donald Trump and his wife Melania were absent from Joe Biden 's inauguration four years ago following Trump's refusal to accept his election defeat in 2020.","Barack Obama posted a photo on Instagram of the couple having dinner together on Michelle's birthday. In the post, he referred to her as ""the love of my life"" along with a photo depicted the couple dressed casually, holding hands while seated for dinner in a room lined with wine bottles. Michelle replied to the wish with a ""love you honey"" with a heart emoji and an emoji of a face blowing a kiss.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117344940,imgsize-1403138,width-400,resizemode-4/117344940.jpg"

He said he would visit the arena, which has a capacity of about 20,000, after his swearing-in, and host a modified inaugural parade there.Trump said other inaugural events, including the Sunday rally and his participation in three official inaugural balls on Monday night, would take place as scheduled.The National Weather Service is predicting the temperature to be around 22 degrees (minus-6 Celsius) at noon during the swearing-in, the coldest since Reagan's second inauguration saw temperatures plunge to 7 degrees (minus-14 Celsius).

Blinken praises staff

'This is a time of transition'

US secretary of state Antony Blinken bid farewell to the state department on Friday, urging staff to continue advancing US foreign policy despite uncertainty surrounding the incoming President-elect Donald Trump administration 's approach to international relations and the treatment of career diplomats.Blinken said that the end of his term did not signal the end of the agency's mission to safeguard and advance the country’s security and democratic values globally. He reaffirmed his core beliefs as the agency’s leader since 2021, stressing the importance of US engagement and leadership on the world stage and the need for cooperation with allies and partners.""I believe in the power and necessity of US engagement and US leadership. We know that when we are not engaged or leading, then likely someone else is, and probably not in a way that advances our interests and values, or maybe no one is. Then you are likely to have a vacuum filled by bad things before good things fill it. I believe in the importance and necessity of working with others. Our alliances and partnerships. America is so much better off when are working with our partners, finding a common cause and purpose... I no longer have the privilege of leading this institution, but I want you to know, I'll be its champion. I'll be our champion. Forever..."" he said.Foreign service officer John Bass also praised Blinken for his integrity and resolve during an informal event held on the stairs of the state department office.Blinken, who will be remembered for his efforts to secure peace in the Middle East during his four-year tenure, encouraged his staff to ""carry on"" as ""the custodians of the power and the promise of American diplomacy.He also stressed the challenges the world faces, saying, ""I've never seen a greater multiplicity, complexity, interconnectedness of challenges than ever before, moving at warp speed or in a world that's more combustible and more contested, a world of change.""Trump has expressed skepticism about the state department's traditional role in shaping foreign policy and has indicated a desire to remove career officials deemed insufficiently loyal. His chosen successor, Senator Marco Rubio , has expressed respect for the foreign service but has not provided details on his plans for managing the department.The outgoing secretary of state’s final days in office have been marked by speeches interrupted by pro-Palestinian protesters accusing him of supporting Israel to the detriment of civilians in Gaza. In his final address to employees, Blinken praised their work over the past four years in the face of challenges in Afghanistan, Ukraine, and the Middle East.""Without you in the picture, this world, our country would look so much different,"" Blinken told a cheering crowd of several hundred staffers assembled at the department's main entrance in Washington, which was adorned with the flags of all the countries with which the US maintains diplomatic relations.""With you in the picture, both are so much better,"" he added, stressing their daily efforts to promote peace and opportunity. ""You're working every day to make things just a little bit better, a little bit more peaceful, a little bit more full of hope, of opportunity. That's your mission, and you do it so well,"" Blinken said.Blinken urged staff to remain resilient during the transition. ""This is a time of transition, and when we talk about transition, sometimes we talk about passing the baton. That's what I'll be doing,"" he said. ""But that's not what most of you will be doing. Most of you come Monday, you will keep running, and what gives me more confidence than anything else is to know that that's exactly what you'll do.""","Blinken urges staff to continue advancing US foreign policy despite uncertainty surrounding incoming President-elect Donald Trump's approach to international relations.

What to know about The North Hill Shooting: 3 people shot, 1 man killed, 2 injured

A shooting at a French restaurant in North Hills, Raleigh, North Carolina, left one man dead and two others injured, including the gunman, on Friday morning, according to the Raleigh police department . Police officers responded to a report of an active shooter situation in the 4300 block of Circle at North Hills Street around 11 am.The incident occurred when a gunman entered Coquette Brasserie and fatally shot a man before turning the gun on himself. The shooter is currently in critical condition, while a bystander, who was also struck by gunfire, sustained non-life-threatening injuries.Police believe the shooting stemmed from a possible dispute, although it is unclear if the men knew each other. No one else was injured during the incident, and all shots were fired inside the restaurant.Raleigh police chief Patterson said, ""This was not a random incident. This is not something that happens on a daily basis in North Hills."" She added that it is possible the individuals involved were known to each other.North Carolina governor Josh Stein posted about the incident and advised people to stay away from the area on social media platform X. “I have talked with [Raleigh Police] Chief Patterson and offered whatever assistance she may need from the state. For the time being, please stay away from the area and stay tuned to local law enforcement for more information.”Numerous officers were seen near the mall following the shooting.The situation is no longer considered an active shooter scenario. However, traffic near the shopping mall is heavily restricted and is expected to remain so for several hours.

"Imran, wife sentenced to jail in corruption case",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imran-wife-sentenced-to-jail-in-corruption-case/articleshow/117340821.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Jailed Pakistani former prime minister Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi , were sentenced to 14-year and seven-year jail terms, respectively, after an accountability court found the couple guilty of corruption by receiving land as a bribe from a Pakistani real-estate czar.The makeshift court operating from Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, where Khan has been incarcerated since Aug 2023, had reserved its verdict three times in the £190-million (about Rs 2,003 crore in Indian currency) Al-Qadir Trust case since Dec last year. Following the ruling, Bushra was arrested from the courtroom.Accountability court judge Nasir Javed Rana also fined Khan Pakistani Rs 1 million ($3,500), while Bibi was fined half that amount.Failure to pay the fines would result in an additional six months in jail for Imran and three months for Bushra, the judge said.According to the verdict, the property of the “sham trust Al-Qadir University Project Trust is hereby forfeited to the federal govt”.“Both convicts are present before the court; they be taken into custody in this case and be handed over to the jail superintendent along with the committal warrant to serve the sentences so awarded,” it added.The couple were indicted in the case on Feb 27, 2024, shortly after the general elections.The case alleges that Khan and his wife had acquired land worth billions of rupees (millions of US dollars) for the Al-Qadir Trust from Malik Riaz Hussain, a prominent property tycoon in Pakistan, to establish a nonprofit educational institute for the poor. In return, Pakistan’s anti-corruption watchdog alleged, Khan’s govt from Aug 2018 to April 2022 had provided legal cover to Riaz’s black money (£130 million), which Britain’s National Crime Agency had recovered and handed over to the Pakistan govt.This has been the fourth major case in which the former cricket star has been convicted. Last year, Khan was convicted in cases related to selling state gifts, leaking state secrets, and unlawful marriage, all of which were later overturned or suspended by the Islamabad high court. Despite this, Khan remains behind bars, with dozens of cases pending against him. He describes the cases as a political witch-hunt.Khan was first arrested in connection with the Al-Qadir Trust case on May 9, 2023, spending just two days in detention. However, the arrest had sparked nationwide protests during which Khan’s supporters had stormed govt buildings and military installations in multiple cities.Speaking to reporters inside the courtroom after his conviction, Imran rejected the notion of striking a deal with anyone to get himself freed from prison. “I will neither make any deal nor seek any relief,” he told reporters, adding that those who stand against dictatorship are punished.His Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI)condemned the conviction as a continuation of “bogus persecution” against Khan and his wife. “While the party awaits the detailed decision, it is important to note that the Al Qadir Trust case against Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi lacks any solid foundation and is bound to collapse,” the PTI said. “All evidence and witness testimonies confirm that there has been no mismanagement or wrongdoing. Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi are merely trustees, with no further involvement in the matter,” it added.","Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were sentenced to 14-year and seven-year jail terms, respectively.
