She has now failed Class 12, being unable to pass physics.

Police arrived at the village to probe the matter, but the community members intervened, claiming they would find the woman themselves. After five hours, the community members brought her back, and asked police not to take further action as ""family honour"" was at stake.

Mysterious poisonings

Targeted assassination has a long history in Israel. In his 2018 book ""Rise and Kill First"", Israeli journalist Ronen Bergman detailed over 2,700 such operations involving poisoned toothpaste, spare tires with remote-control bombs and exploding phones. He suggested it poisoned Yasser Arafat, the longtime Palestinian leader, which Israel denies. Tehran has accused Israel of many killings inside Iran.In Nov 2020, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh , a scientist described by intelligence agencies as a leading figure in Iran's nuclear weapons programme, was killed in an ambush.

Top Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh is dead. Now what?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/top-hamas-leader-ismail-haniyeh-is-dead-now-what/articleshow/112181241.cms,"The assassination of Hamas's political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran has sent shockwaves through the region, potentially setting the stage for increased tensions and retaliatory actions against Israel. The strike, which Hamas has blamed on Israel , has left the Islamist movement scrambling to find a new leader while raising concerns about the direction the group will take amid ongoing conflict .Haniyeh's death comes almost ten months into the latest Gaza war, a conflict that shows no signs of a ceasefire. With his deputy, Saleh al-Aruri, also killed earlier this year in a strike in Lebanon, two names have emerged as possible successors: Musa Abu Marzuk and Khalil al-Haya.Musa Abu Marzuk, a member of Hamas's political bureau, is seen as a more moderate figure within the movement. He has a history of advocating for a Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders and has participated in indirect talks with Israel. However, his moderate stance may clash with the armed wing of Hamas, which is less inclined towards diplomatic solutions.Khalil al-Haya, on the other hand, is closely aligned with the armed wing's chief, Yahya Sinwar. Known for his staunch support of armed resistance against Israel, Haya's rise to leadership could signal a shift towards more aggressive tactics. His personal history of loss to Israeli airstrikes and his leadership during Hamas’s 2006 electoral victory position him as a strong contender, especially among hardliners within the movement.There is also speculation that Khaled Meshaal, who previously led Hamas, could make a return to leadership. Meshaal's experience and previous tenure might offer stability during this tumultuous time.Analysts are divided on the impact of Haniyeh's assassination. Joost Hiltermann of the International Crisis Group believes that while the loss is significant, Hamas has ""plenty of leadership material"" to continue its operations. However, Hugh Lovatt of the European Council on Foreign Relations warns that the assassination could embolden hardliners within Hamas, leading to a more radicalized and potentially more violent phase in the conflict.The ongoing war, which erupted after Hamas's attacks on Israel on October 7, has claimed thousands of lives on both sides, with heavy casualties reported in Gaza. The killing of Haniyeh could also derail any progress in ceasefire negotiations, particularly as Haniyeh's political leadership, based in Doha, had been pushing for a ceasefire and the release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza.The strike in Tehran is not an isolated incident. It follows Israel’s reported assassination of a Hezbollah commander in Beirut, an event linked to recent rocket attacks on the Golan Heights. The situation has led to fears of wider regional escalation, with Hamas's armed wing warning of ""enormous consequences"" for the region following Haniyeh's death.Regional analysts caution that while the situation is volatile, it is unlikely that Iran, a key backer of Hamas, will engage in full-scale war with Israel unless its vital interests are directly threatened. However, the risk of spiraling violence remains, especially with various Iran-backed groups involved in the conflict.","Ismail Haniyeh's death has left Hamas scrambling to find a new leader.

Illinois woman Sonya Massey fatally shot by Sheriff’s deputy had called 911 for help multiple times before her death,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/illinois-woman-sonya-massey-fatally-shot-by-sheriffs-deputy-had-called-911-for-help-multiple-times-before-her-death/articleshow/112181031.cms,"Sonya Massey , a Black woman who was fatally shot in the face by an Illinois sheriff's deputy after she called 911 for assistance, had reached out to emergency services at least twice in the days leading up to her death on July 6, according to newly released records.One of the calls came from her mother, Donna Massey, who expressed concern to the dispatcher, saying, “I don't want you guys to hurt her,” and explained that her daughter feared the police.She specifically requested that no officer who might be ""prejudiced"" be sent, reported AP.The Sangamon County Sheriff’s Department is currently investigating whether the deputies who responded to the call about a suspected prowler at Massey’s home were aware of her mental health history. Body-worn camera footage released last week suggests that this information was not communicated to the officers. In the video, former sheriff’s deputy Sean Grayson, who shot Massey, is heard asking dispatch two minutes after the shooting if there was any record of previous calls indicating she had mental health issues.Jeff Wilhite, spokesperson for Sheriff Jack Campbell, mentioned that while such information is passed along if known, there is no automatic mechanism to ensure it is relayed. “The dispatcher would have to know 'yes, it's the same person' and 'yes, it's the same address,'"" Wilhite explained.Another 911 call from July 4, released in response to public records requests, involved an unnamed caller reporting that someone was trying to harm them, only to disconnect after stating, “This must not be the right number.” Officials are unsure if Massey made this call.Grayson, 30, has been charged with first-degree murder, aggravated battery with a firearm, and official misconduct for the shooting death of 36-year-old Massey. He has pleaded not guilty and is being held without bond.The body-cam footage reveals that after Grayson and another deputy arrived at Massey’s home just before 1 a.m. on July 6, she appeared confused, repeatedly asking, “Please God” and “Don’t hurt me.” Inside her home, she struggled to find her ID and asked for her Bible. When she suddenly said, “I rebuke you in the name of Jesus,” while holding a pot of water, Grayson drew his gun and fired three shots, one of which struck her below the left eye.Massey’s family has stated that she had a history of mental health struggles and had recently sought treatment. Her 17-year-old son, Malachi Hill Massey, shared that his mother had checked into a 30-day inpatient treatment program in the St. Louis area at the start of July, only to return two days later.On July 4, at 9:27 p.m., a 911 caller from Massey's address reported that ""somebody's trying to hurt me."" When pressed for more information, the caller said, ""Never mind,"" and disconnected. Later that morning, Donna Massey called 911, describing her daughter's paranoid behavior and emphasizing that she was not dangerous but had become increasingly fearful and distressed.Springfield police responded to the call and found that Massey did not want to speak to medical professionals but was checked by emergency medical technicians. Massey herself later called to report a neighbor hitting her with a brick, leading a sheriff's deputy to meet her at a hospital. The deputy noted that she appeared to be experiencing mental health issues and was seeking treatment for minor injuries. Massey mentioned she had recently been released from a mental health facility and claimed police had tried to run her off the road earlier that day.Twelve hours after this incident, Grayson and another deputy responded to the July 6 call, where body-cam footage shows them noticing the broken windows on Massey’s SUV. Grayson questioned her about the vehicle, and when she denied owning it, he asked if she was “doing all right mentally,” to which she replied, “Yes, I took my medicine.”Minutes later, after the shooting, Grayson radioed in to ask if there was any call history indicating Massey had mental health issues. The response is not heard, but Grayson is later heard saying, “That would explain a lot.”","Sonya Massey, 36, was fatally shot in the face by an Illinois sheriff's deputy after she called 911 for assistance.

Khaled Meshaal poised to lead Hamas after assassination of Ismail Haniyeh: What does his return mean?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/khaled-meshaal-poised-to-lead-hamas-after-assassination-of-ismail-haniyeh-what-does-his-return-mean/articleshow/112181240.cms,"Khaled Meshaal , a figure with a storied history in the Palestinian militant group Hamas, is being considered to take over leadership following the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Iran. Meshaal, who survived an Israeli assassination attempt in 1997, has been a prominent leader within Hamas for decades, navigating the group through periods of intense conflict and diplomatic challenges.In 1997, Meshaal became internationally known when Israeli agents, under the orders of then-Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, attempted to assassinate him by injecting poison into his ear on the streets of Amman, Jordan. The botched operation led to a diplomatic crisis, with Jordan's King Hussein threatening to nullify the peace treaty with Israel unless an antidote was provided. Israel complied, and the incident not only saved Meshaal's life but also elevated his status within the Palestinian resistance.Meshaal, 68, led Hamas from exile for many years, representing the group in international diplomatic circles, a role that allowed him to avoid the travel restrictions that confined many other Hamas officials. His leadership was marked by his ability to navigate the complexities of regional politics, including strained relations with Iran following his support for the Sunni Muslim-led uprising against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in 2011.The recent assassination of Haniyeh, which Hamas and Tehran have blamed on Israel, has brought Meshaal back into the spotlight as the likely candidate to assume leadership. His potential return comes at a critical juncture, as Hamas faces both internal and external pressures amid an ongoing and brutal conflict with Israel.Since its founding during the first Palestinian uprising in 1987, Hamas has been targeted by Israel, which has assassinated or attempted to assassinate several of its leaders. Meshaal's survival of the 1997 assassination attempt was a turning point that solidified his position within the group. After the deaths of Hamas founders Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and Abdel-Aziz Al-Rantissi in 2004, Meshaal assumed the overall leadership of Hamas.While Meshaal has maintained a hardline stance against Israel, rejecting the idea of a permanent peace deal, he has also signaled a willingness to accept a Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders as a temporary solution, coupled with a long-term ceasefire. This nuanced position has sometimes put him at odds with other Hamas leaders, particularly those based in Gaza who favor more militant approaches.The October 7, 2023, attack by Hamas militants on Israel, which resulted in significant casualties and the kidnapping of over 250 people, underscored the group's continued commitment to armed resistance. Israel's subsequent retaliation has devastated Gaza, killing tens of thousands and leaving much of the territory in ruins. Amid this chaos, Meshaal has called for broader Arab and Muslim participation in the conflict against Israel, asserting that Palestinians will decide Gaza's future governance without external influence.Meshaal's early involvement with Hamas began after he joined the Muslim Brotherhood at the age of 15 while living in Kuwait. Over the years, he transitioned from a schoolteacher to a key fundraiser and eventually a leading political figure within Hamas, operating from various Middle Eastern capitals including Doha, Cairo, and previously Damascus.Despite his past, Meshaal's potential return to leadership reflects the ongoing influence of long-time Hamas figures in shaping the group's future direction. As Hamas navigates its current leadership crisis, Meshaal's experience and historical significance within the movement could guide the group through the next phase of its struggle. Whether his leadership will bring a shift in strategy or reinforce Hamas's existing policies remains to be seen.","Khaled Meshaal survived an Israeli assassination attempt in 1997.

'See my assessment below on the 13 Keys Tracker on where The Keys stand NOW.'Harris filed her nomination on July 27 officially and declared her candidature for President race.Harris has an upper hand in this election because of the several key factors like she faced no primary challenger, there has been minimal threat from third-party candidates, and the economy remains strong both in the short and long term.With the transition from Biden to Harris, the White House has avoided major policy changes, and Harris is not contending with any scandals or significant social unrest.Lichtman observed that with Biden’s shift to Harris as the presumptive nominee, the Democrats have lost the incumbency advantage. As Harris and Republican candidate Donald Trump prepare to face off, Lichtman considers the race essentially open, reported The Daily Mail.However, Lichtman also pointed out that the Democrats have managed to mitigate potential fallout from this transition.

"Death by firing squad is a legal punishment, South Carolina’s top court rules",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/death-by-firing-squad-is-a-legal-punishment-south-carolinas-top-court-rules/articleshow/112181242.cms,"The South Carolina Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that death by electrocution , firing squad or lethal injection are all legal forms of execution in the state, finding that none could be considered a cruel or unusual punishment because inmates can choose the option they consider the least painful.The decision came after the state passed a law in 2021 that made death by electric chair or by firing squad legal options for people on death row.The bill, which made electrocution the default method of execution, was proposed because South Carolina could not procure drugs for lethal injection, which remains the most widely used method in other states.Inmates sued, arguing that electrocutions and firing squads could cause extreme pain, and were cruel, corporal or unusual punishments prohibited by the South Carolina Constitution.But their arguments were largely rejected by the court’s five justices, a majority of whom are conservatives. The ruling is expected to allow executions to restart, with all three methods available. There are 32 inmates on death row in South Carolina.Associate Justice John Cannon Few wrote in the majority opinion that the methods “cannot be considered cruel because the condemned inmate may elect to have the state employ the method he and his lawyers believe will cause him the least pain.”The law passed by the Republican-controlled state Legislature, Few wrote, was not “an effort to inflict pain” but rather a “sincere effort to make the death penalty less inhumane while enabling the state to carry out its laws.”He added that “the inescapable reality that an execution by any method may not go as planned — that it will be ‘botched’ — does not render the method ‘cruel’ under the constitution.”“The main effect that this will have is that regardless of whether lethal injection is available, or whether the state can get its hands on lethal injection drugs, executions will resume,” said Madalyn K. Wasilczuk, a professor of law at the University of South Carolina. There are four prisoners on death row who have run out of appeals and are eligible for execution.Opponents of the death penalty condemned the ruling. Jace Woodrum, the director of the American Civil Liberties Union of South Carolina, said that resuming executions “not only fails to make us safer but raises the possibility of the state killing innocent people in our name.”","The South Carolina Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that death by electrocution, firing squad or lethal injection are all legal forms of execution in the state.

Is Democratic strategy of labeling Trump and Vance as 'Weird' a game-changer?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-elections-is-democratic-kamala-harris-strategy-of-labeling-trump-and-vance-as-weird-a-game-changer/articleshow/112181127.cms,"Vice President Kamala Harris and her Democratic allies have embraced a new label to describe their Republican opponents : “weird.” This unconventional branding has sparked a flurry of responses, as the Democrats seek to turn the tables on Donald Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen JD Vance.The label, which surfaced in interviews and online exchanges, has quickly become a central theme of Harris’ campaign.The strategy targets not just the policies but also the personas of Trump and Vance, with a particular focus on their controversial comments. Vance's previous suggestion that childless leaders ""don’t really have a direct stake"" in the country, and Trump's odd references to the fictional serial killer Hannibal Lecter during speeches, have both been used to underscore the “weird” narrative.David Karpf, a strategic communication professor at George Washington University, praised the tactic as a concise and resonant message. “It’s a clever way to encapsulate what many feel about Trump and Vance’s rhetoric,” Karpf said. “It forces their campaign to respond in a way that only amplifies the critique.”The effectiveness of this approach is evident in the scramble it has caused within the Trump-Vance camp. So far, their attempts to counter the narrative have struggled to gain traction. Republicans have attempted to deflect by highlighting what they consider "" weird "" aspects of Harris’ persona and policy ideas, but the Democratic campaign has managed to keep the focus on their opponents.Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a Democrat and Harris ally, has been one of the most vocal proponents of this new messaging. His repeated characterizations of Trump and Vance as ""just weird"" have gained significant media attention and online traction. The Democratic Governors Association, which Walz chairs, has seized on the phrase, amplifying it across platforms like X (formerly known as Twitter).Even in official communications, the Harris campaign is leaning into the label. In a recent news release following Trump's appearance on Fox News, the campaign included a pointed line in its summary: “Trump is old and quite weird?” This framing, subtle yet biting, encapsulates the Democrats’ approach of turning Republicans’ own tactics against them.Senators Brian Schatz of Hawaii and Chris Murphy of Connecticut have also joined in, sharing a video on X where they critique Vance’s past comments on childless Americans as ""a super weird idea."" This online reinforcement has helped solidify the label in the public consciousness.Harris herself has embraced the term during public appearances, directly calling out Trump’s “wild lies” and some of the remarks made by Vance. ""It’s just plain weird,"" she remarked at a recent fundraiser, a line that has since been echoed by her supporters.The “weird” narrative appears to draw from a broader strategy of flipping the script on Republican rhetoric. For years, Republicans have tried to paint Harris and other Democrats as out-of-touch or awkward. Now, Democrats are turning that same critique on its head, using the label to question the judgment and relatability of their opponents.Political analysts suggest that this approach may serve a dual purpose: it not only puts Trump and Vance on the defensive but also works to insulate Harris from similar attacks. Jacob Neiheisel, a political communication professor at the University at Buffalo, likened it to past efforts by candidates to undermine their opponents’ credibility by casting them as unserious or out of step with voters.As the campaign progresses, it remains to be seen whether this strategy will have lasting effects. For now, however, the Democrats' decision to label their opponents as ""weird"" has injected a new dynamic into the race, one that has the potential to reshape the narrative as the election season heats up.","Kamala Harris and her Democratic allies have embraced a new label to describe their Republican opponents : “weird.” This unconventional branding has sparked a flurry of responses, as the Democrats seek to turn the tables on Donald Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen JD Vance.

Trump's pattern of racially charged criticism

Trump's disputed claims about immigration and the economy

Response to Trump's remarks

In a recent appearance before the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) in Chicago, former President Donald Trump made misleading remarks about Vice President Kamala Harris , questioning her racial identity and heritage . Trump claimed that Harris had only recently started identifying as Black, suggesting that she previously promoted only her Indian heritage.These statements are factually incorrect and ignore well-documented aspects of Harris's background and public life.Kamala Harris is the daughter of a Jamaican father and an Indian mother, both of whom were immigrants to the United States. Throughout her political career, Harris has openly embraced both aspects of her heritage. As an undergraduate, she attended Howard University, a historically Black college, and was a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha, a historically Black sorority. Her political career also includes active participation in the Congressional Black Caucus, and she has consistently supported legislation benefiting the Black community.This incident is not the first time Trump has questioned the identity or qualifications of a political opponent who is a person of color. His comments at the NABJ event follow a history of racially charged attacks, including the promotion of the ""birther"" conspiracy against President Barack Obama and derogatory remarks about various women of color, including former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley.During the event, Trump also repeated his unfounded assertion that immigrants in the country illegally are taking jobs from Black Americans, a claim that has been widely debunked by economists and fact-checkers. He further drew controversial comparisons between the January 6th Capitol riot and other protests, which sparked criticism from the audience and journalists alike.The event was marked by tension, with Trump's interview turning hostile as he accused ABC News journalist Rachel Scott of being ""nasty"" and criticized the network for its coverage. Michael Tyler, communications director for Harris's campaign, condemned Trump's comments as divisive and out of touch with the realities of Black Americans.","Kamala Harris is the daughter of a Jamaican father and an Indian mother, both of whom were immigrants to the United States.

The official announcement of the agreements is scheduled for Thursday, with the guilty plea proceedings set to occur during the week of August 5.Daniel D'Allara, who lost his twin brother John, an NYPD officer, in the 9/11 attacks, expressed his deep disappointment and frustration with the government's handling of the case. He told The Post, ""I am very disappointed. We waited patiently for a long time. I wanted the death penalty — the government has failed us.""Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, an engineer educated in the US, reportedly introduced the concept of using airplanes as weapons to al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden.

But above everything, Barron was an enigma as he never took part in any activity -- not in sports, never attended parties or ate meals with his friends.It was Melania's request that Barron Trump's name should not appear on any social media post regarding the school and he was the only student who was never mentioned in the yearbook.'Barron was very funny and sociable.

Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro is a popular politician and has seen high approval ratings since he was elected in 2022. As a candidate for attorney general, he was one of few Democrats to win statewide in 2016, and he got more votes than President Joe Biden in 2020. He would be the first Jewish vice-president it he is chosen and if the Democratic ticket proves victorious. On Israel war, he has taken a strong stand and criticized the students protests on campuses in his state, Josh Shapiro's wife Lori was his high school sweetheart. Lori previously worked in the White House during the Clinton administration as an analyst in the Office of Science and Technology Policy. They are parents to four kids. Josh Shapiro can make Democrats win Pennsylvania that they badly want to win -- because of his popularity. Republicans reportedly see Shapiro as a threat.

51-year-old Josh Shapiro is leading the race to be Kamala Harris' VP pick -- the name will be announced soon. It has been reported that Harris will hold her first rally with her VP pick in Philadelphia. Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg are also in the race. Harris reportedly is interviewing potential VP candidates.But Shapiro said he had snot spoken to Harris since July 21.More than two dozen public education advocacy groups wrote a letter asking Harris not to select Shapiro over his support for private school vouchers. School vouchers, which provide parents with state funding to send children to private schools, are an issue on which Shapiro has agreed to compromise with Republicans since becoming governor.A recent video of a strong and confident Josh Shapiro asking Donald Trump to stop sh** talking about America has gone viral. ""You ever see this guy? He kind of meanders over, can't really walk well, and he goes over to the flag and hugs the flag. I love the flag, but it’s a weird thing he does.

According to the government’s home and tribal affairs department there are currently eight major conflicts underway in Kurram and several of them date back to the pre-Partition era.The latest clashes erupted last week between two families — one Shia and another Sunni — over ownership of a property and the hostility swiftly spread to several villages and settlements before engulfing the entire district.Among the dead, authorities said, 34 were from Shia tribes and eight belonged to Sunni tribes. Firing between Shia and Sunni tribes continued through Sunday night and Monday morning in Maqbal and Teri Mangal areas of upper Kurram, near the Afghan border; Para Chamkani in central Kurram; and Balish Khel in lower Kurram. According to locals, Sunni tribes in the area were getting support from across the border since the same families live on both sides of the Durand Line, a disputed border between Pakistan and Afghanistan.Most of the villages in the area faced a shortage of food and lifesaving medicines due to clashes and closure of roads by authorities to contain the unrest as the warring sides pounded each other with small and heavy weapons.",At least 43 people have been killed and more than 200 injured after a land dispute turned into a wider sectarian conflict.
