Utah Valley University locked down







Charlie Kirk, a 31-year-old conservative political activist and a close ally of US President Donald Trump, was shot dead while speaking at Utah Valley University on Thursday.Kirk was addressing students under a tent decorated with slogans reading “The American Comeback” and “Prove Me Wrong” when a single gunshot was fired, striking him in the neck.Disturbing video footage from the scene shows him clutching his wound as students screamed and fled the area.Trump confirmed Kirk’s death shortly after the incident and announced that American flags would be flown at half-mast until Sunday as a mark of respect.Authorities have not yet released details on the shooter or the motive behind the attack.FBI Director Kash Patel said that the suspect, who was detained, has been released after interrogation.He had announced the arrest of a person from the scene, praising law enforcement’s quick action. “The subject for the horrific shooting today that took the life of Charlie Kirk is now in custody,” Patel had written on X.Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said officials believe only one “person involved” in the shooting death of Charlie Kirk on a Utah college campus. “No information suggests a second person,” he stated Wednesday.However, investigators are still seeking anyone with more details. A person of interest is currently in custody and being interviewed, according to the governor.President Trump, who counted Kirk as a key political ally, paid tribute to him both on Truth Social and in an interview with the New York Post.“No one understood or had the heart of the youth in the United States better than Charlie,” Trump wrote online. “He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me.”Trump ordered American flags flown at half-mast until Sunday evening after the assassination of political activist Charlie Kirk. On Truth Social, @Trump shared that the ""Legendary"" debater had been killed, expressing condolences to his wife Erika and young family. He has been closely monitoring the situation as it develops and acknowledged Kirk's impactful legacy.Trump described Kirk as “a very, very good friend” and “a tremendous person,” urging supporters: “We must all pray for Charlie Kirk.”Former Utah congressman Jason Chaffetz, who was present at the event, said Kirk had just taken a question from the audience when the shot rang out.“As soon as I saw Charlie go back, you realise that it was a shot,” Chaffetz told Fox News. “It wasn’t as if there was a whole bunch of gunfire. It was one shot.”He added that security at the event appeared light, with only a small police presence.Videos posted to social media show panic erupting as the shot was fired. Students screamed, ducked for cover, and rushed across a nearby fountain to escape the courtyard.Some in the crowd attempted to rush to Kirk’s aid as security hustled him away. A woman in a red “MAGA” hat was seen in tears, while others were filmed praying near the scene.Images circulating online showed an older white man being led away by police, with one officer reportedly heard saying, “He said he shot him, but I don’t know.”However, law enforcement later clarified that this individual was not the suspect. Confusion remains over whether the gunman fled the campus or is still in hiding.Politicians from across the spectrum denounced the shooting. Vice President JD Vance wrote: “Dear God, protect Charlie in his darkest hour.” Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said disputes should be resolved “through debate, not violence.”Democratic leaders also expressed support. California Governor Gavin Newsom called the attack “disgusting, vile, and reprehensible,” while former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said: “Political violence has absolutely no place in our nation.”UVU, Utah’s largest public university with nearly 47,000 students, was closed after the attack. Administrators confirmed the campus would remain under tight security while the search for the shooter continued.The event had already been controversial: a petition calling on the university to bar Kirk from speaking attracted nearly 1,000 signatures. Officials defended the appearance as an exercise in free speech and debate.","Charlie Kirk, a 31-year-old conservative political activist and a close ally of US President Donald Trump, was shot dead while speaking at Utah Valley University on Thursday.

Police are trying to piece together how the gunshots were fired and what led to the shooting as the two students were considered ""inseparable"" by friends.The incident occurred around 10.30am at RCI Vidya Vihar hostel in Knowledge Park-III. The two students - Deepak Kumar (22) from Andhra Pradesh and Devansh Chauhan (23) from Agra - were both enrolled in the PGDM programme at Birla Institute of Management Technology (Bimtech). They were, however, not roommates. It was in Kumar's room where the shots were fired. Chauhan is in Kailash hospital. His condition is critical.Both bullets came from the same licensed revolver, which was fully loaded and belonged to Chauhan's father Surender Singh Chauhan, who retired as a circle officer in UP STF on Aug 31. Chauhan, who went home last Saturday to attend his father's farewell party, is believed to have sneaked the gun out when he left for his hostel on Tuesday morning itself.Chauhan had reached the hostel barely a couple of hours before the incident.""He had come home on Saturday to attend our father's retirement party. On Tuesday morning, he returned to college. He left home around 5.30am and reached his hostel by 9am. It was around noon that we received a call from the college authorities about the firing incident,"" said Shivang Chaurasia, Chauhan's brother who lives in Gurgaon.Surender Chauhan told TOI he kept the gun in a cupboard in his room. ""It was only a few hours since Chauhan left home. I didn't realise that the gun was missing too.""At Vidya Vihar hostel, it was a guard who first sensed something amiss after hearing faint groans from the locked room. Unable to get any response, he alerted the hostel warden. After repeated attempts to open the door failed, some staff members climbed to the rear balcony with a ladder and peered inside. What they saw was shocking. Inside, Kumar lay dead. Chauhan was groaning in pain.According to the chief medical officer of Kailash hospital, the bullet lodged in Kumar's head was fired from the right side. ""The boy suffered brain death,"" he said.In Chauhan's case too, the bullet was fired from the right. ""The revolver had six bullets. Two were used, four remain. No official complaint has been filed yet,"" the investigating officer said.A police team arrived at the hostel around 11.30am and secured the area. Forensic experts recovered the revolver, four live cartridges, and two bullet shells. They also seized the students' mobile phones, laptops, and other personal belongings from the room.While the exact sequence of events is unclear, police are examining the possibility of a confrontation between the two students.Bimtech did not respond to requests for a comment.",Deepak Kumar (22) from Andhra Pradesh and Devansh Chauhan (23) from Agra were both enrolled in the PGDM programme at Birla Institute of Management Technology (Bimtech) It was in Kumar's room where the shots were fired.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has always stuck to the cardinal constitutional principle of separation of powers, a five-judge bench led by CJI B R Gavai said Thursday, following the Centre's emphasis on the executive, legislature and judiciary sticking to their domains. ""Judicial activism"" should not become ""judicial terrorism"", the CJI said.The bench of CJI Gavai and Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar said, ""We believe in the separation of powers between the executive, legislature and judiciary. However, if one wing ...fails to discharge its duties, Supreme Court as custodians of the Constitution and protector of rights, cannot remain a mute spectator.""This response from SC came after solicitor general Tushar Mehta repeatedly pleaded with bench that SC fixing timelines for the President and governors to act on bills, not specified in Articles 200 and 201 of the Constitution, would amount to judiciary amending the provisions, a task exclusively reserved for Parliament.Before reserving its opinion on the Presidential Reference which sought SC's opinion on 14 questions relatable to an unprecedented April 8 decision of a two-judge SC bench fixing timelines for the President and governors, the CJI B R Gavai said, ""I am a strong believer in separation of powers.I have been declaring in public that judicial activism should not turn into judicial terrorism.""Interestingly, the bench said it disagreed with an argument of opposition-led states that SC, in its jurisdiction to render opinion to the President under Article 143, cannot reverse the two-judge bench's April 8 judgment, which apart from fixing timelines for the President and governors, had granted deemed assent to 10 bills pending for a long time with the Tamil Nadu governor.The bench said, ""We will answer the President's queries and will declare the law, which will hold the field for future. We will not decide the facts of the case and the correctness of the decision of the two-judge bench. But the interpretation of Articles 200 and 201 by the two-judge bench is a view which is not binding on the five-judge bench.""Mehta said the President is not questioning the correctness of the April 8 judgment and is only seeking opinion of the apex court on the correctness of the law laid down by the two-judge bench on timelines and whether the judiciary can grant deemed assent to bills which is the sole prerogative and discretion of governors and the President.Both attorney general R Venkataramani and Mehta acknowledged that governors cannot sit idle on a bill indefinitely. However, they argued that in certain situations, a governor is entitled to use his discretionary power to withhold assent to a bill if, in his view, it could subvert or undermine the Constitution, erode democracy, have national implications, or trigger a dispute with other states.Venkataramani said the constitutional mechanism under Articles 200 and 201 has worked smoothly for over 75 years in which more than 94% of bills have been assented to by governors or the President. Why would the court disturb the settled mechanism which has worked well because of some stray instances of delay by governors, he asked.The AG argued that if because of certain instances of delay or withholding of assent SC enters the Parliament's domain to snip or add words to these two provisions, it would lead to a 'Procrustean bed' phenomenon (originating from Greek mythology in which a bandit used to force travellers to fit the length of the bed by either amputating their limbs or stretching them), which would encourage states to rush to SC for moulding of constitutional provisions for every small aberration in future.","Supreme Court has always stuck to the cardinal constitutional principle of separation of powers, a five-judge bench led by CJI B R Gavai said.

NEW DELHI: Reminding police personnel that they have to forgo their personal bias relating to religion, race or caste after donning the uniform, Supreme Court on Thursday came down heavily on Maharashtra police for not holding a probe into the statement of an eyewitness in the communal riots in Akola in May 2023, reports Amit Anand Choudhary.The eyewitness, Mohammad Afzal, claimed he could identify one of the assailants who assaulted him and killed an auto driver. Afzal said the driver was killed as he was mistaken for a Muslim.The court sought an SIT to be set up comprising senior police officers of Hindu and Muslim communities.The riot was triggered by an objectionable social media post resulting in the death of one person, Vilas Mahadevrao Gaikwad. The same people had attacked the eyewitness, Mohammad Afzal , who was then 17. Though the police recorded his statement in the hospital, it did not conduct any probe into the allegation that the deceased was murdered under the impression that he belonged to the Muslim community. He alleged that the deceased was killed as he was plying an auto rickshaw of a Muslim, which bore a sticker with the name 'Garib Nawaz'.Taking strong exception to state police inaction, a bench of Justices Sanjay Kumar and Satish Chandra Sharma said it was ""total dereliction"" of duty on the part of officials, including superintendent of police of Akola.""Needless to state, when members of the police force don their uniforms, they are required to shed their personal predilections and biases, be they religious, racial, casteist or otherwise. They must be true to the call of duty attached to their office and their uniform with absolute and total integrity. Unfortunately, in the case on hand, this did not happen,"" SC said. It directed the state's home secretary to constitute a special investigation team comprising senior police officers of both Hindu and Muslim communities, to undertake an investigation into allegations made by Afzal by registering an FIR in connection with the assault upon him and take appropriate action. The SIT has been directed to file a probe report in court within three months. It also directed the secretary to initiate appropriate disciplinary action against all erring police officers and take measures to sensitise the force. The court also raised questions on Bombay HC which had disbelieved Afzal's allegation and found fault with his relatives for not trying to lodge a report with police immediately.""Though the affidavits filed by the police inspector of the Old City Police Station, Akola, tried to attribute motives to the appellant and the same was willingly accepted and acted upon by the high court, we are not persuaded to agree at this stage. It was for the police to investigate the truth or otherwise of the specific allegations made by the appellant, a 17-year-old boy, who asserted that he was an eyewitness to the murder of Vilas Mahadevrao Gaikwad and was himself assaulted by the very same assailants. If, in fact, the deceased was really murdered under the impression that he belonged to Muslim community and the assailants were not of that community, that was a fact that had to be ascertained after thorough and proper investigation. When the appellant claimed that he could identify one of the four assailants, that claim also required to be followed up with detailed investigation by ascertaining the location of the person so identified at the relevant time through mobile phone location, call data records, etc,"" the court said.SC said neither the police inspector nor the high court were correct in their assumption and understanding that it was for Afzal or his relatives to pursue the police to take necessary steps in that regard and that the police were not required to take any steps, despite their knowledge of the commission of a cognisable offence. ""What is even more distressing to note is that the appellant made a written complaint to the SP of Akola on June 1, 2023, through his father, but to no avail. .. There is no explanation forthcoming as to whether he even undertook an inquiry to satisfy himself about the truth or otherwise of the information received, as mandated by the provision. This conduct on the part of a superior police officer...is indeed a cause for great concern,"" the court said.The apex court also expressed surprise that a police inspector filed a reply on behalf of the govt in the case. ""It is surprising that, in a matter involving the State, represented by the chief secretary, and its home ministry, wherein a serious issue has been raised before the highest court in the country, no senior official chose to file an affidavit before this court and left it to an inspector of the local police station to do the needful. More so, as serious allegations were made against a superintendent of Police, who was impleaded by name,"" it said.",Supreme Court came down heavily on Maharashtra police for not holding a probe into the statement of an eyewitness in the communal riots in Akola in May 2023.

JAMMU/SRINAGAR: J&K continues to be on the edge over the detention of AAP legislator from Doda, Mehraj Malik, under the Public Safety Act (PSA). While a low-intensity blast on Thursday morning triggered panic in Jammu’s Doda town, which already remains tense, high drama unfolded in Srinagar when police locked the circuit house gates to prevent AAP’s Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh from holding a protest against Malik’s detention, and refused to allow NC president Farooq Abdullah to meet him.Singh, who reached Srinagar on Wednesday evening with other AAP functionaries, was scheduled to hold a press conference and a protest at Lal Chowk. However, police locked the gates of the circuit house and barred him and others from stepping out.NC president Farooq Abdullah, who arrived to offer support to Singh, was stopped at the main gate. The AAP MP climbed on a plastic chair and tried to converse with him. Alleging that he had been placed under “house arrest”, Singh said the govt guesthouse had been turned into a “police camp” and the authorities refused to disclose the grounds for confining him inside.Both the leaders argued with security personnel for not allowing them to meet, and lashed out at LG Manoj Sinha, accusing him of abusing his authority. An upset Farooq said “an elected govt is in power in J&K, but the LG has become a king”.The NC leader finally left, bidding Singh “khuda hafiz” from outside the gate. The AAP MP later shared video clips on X and said: “If this is not dictatorship, then what is it?”CM Omar Abdullah, too, termed it “illegal detention” and slammed the “highhandedness” of the LG administration.“They claim everything is fine in J&K; that the atmosphere is good, people are happy, and ‘naya Kashmir’ is emerging. The reality is they do nothing except use force,” he said while talking to reporters. “They have used force against us, invoked wrong laws to arrest Mehraj Malik… And now they have illegally detained a Rajya Sabha member. Under which law? Did they serve any notice to him? This is not good for the democracy of J&K and it sends the wrong message,” Omar added.Earlier, panic gripped locals following the explosion in a house in Dumri-Thukar Mohalla of Doda town, although no injuries were reported, officials said. Two individuals were detained for questioning.Doda remained calm but tense on Thursday and prohibitory orders remained in force for the third consecutive day across the district following protests over the slapping of PSA against Malik.The Doda MLA’s father, Shamas Udin Malik, made a fervent appeal for release of his son and apologised on his behalf for using “unparliamentary” language against deputy commissioner Harvinder Singh, even as he accused the DC of “personal vendetta”. . “I apologise for the words he has used… I have full faith that LG sahib and Modi sahib will definitely do justice with us. We humbly urge the Prime Minister and the LG to release him and reunite our family,” he said.","J&K continues to be on the edge over the detention of AAP legislator from Doda, Mehraj Malik, under the Public Safety Act (PSA) A low-intensity blast on Thursday morning triggered panic in Jammu’s Doda town, which already remains tense. High drama unfolded in Srinagar when police locked the circuit house gates to prevent AAP's Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh from holding a protest.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123838286,imgsize-102002,width-400,resizemode-4/aap39s-protest.jpg"

Glitch Fuels Speculation: Trump Posted 'Fake' Video After Charlie Kirk’s Death?

The conspiracy theories

The pushback

The investigation continues





The fatal shooting of conservative youth leader Charles “Charlie” Kirk at a Utah university on Thursday has now taken a dramatic turn online, where thousands are dissecting every frame of video footage for hidden clues.In videos viewed millions of times on X, two men standing behind Kirk just moments before the bullet struck are under the scanner. One, wearing a white T-shirt and cap, can be seen fiddling with his hat, brushing his ear, and shifting his phone forward. A second man, believed by many to be Kirk’s longtime security guard, appears to adjust his shirt sleeve and make a subtle gesture with his hand.Mere seconds later, the crack of a rifle echoed through the packed tent of nearly 3,000 people. Kirk collapsed, hit in the neck, as panic tore through the crowd.The timing of the gestures has led some users to suggest the two men were signaling the shooter. “Good catch,” one user posted. Another wrote, “Real people already finding out more info than MSM.” Others even tagged FBI Director Kash Patel, demanding an investigation.Adding fuel to the frenzy, additional video angles show the man in the white cap instantly dropping to the ground as shots rang out before fleeing behind the tent with others.For some, that quick reaction looked rehearsed.But not everyone is convinced. Many called the theories reckless and disrespectful. “The guy in the black has been Charlie’s security guard for as long as I can remember,” one person wrote. Another argued simply: “These two are in the line of fire tho?”For now, federal investigators remain focused on hard evidence. The FBI has confirmed recovery of a high-powered bolt-action rifle believed to have been used in the attack but has not addressed the online claims of signaling. No arrests have been made.The divide is clear: while America mourns, parts of the internet are locked in a frenzied hunt for meaning in every gesture, whether coincidence or conspiracy.","The fatal shooting of conservative youth leader Charles “Charlie’ Kirk at a Utah university on Thursday has now taken a dramatic turn online.

According to a report by The New York Times, within minutes of the shooting on Wednesday (September 10), videos were posted on Elon Musk 's X and were viewed over 11 million times within two hours. The graphic footage also spread to Meta-owned platforms like Instagram and Threads, as well as YouTube and Telegram, accumulating millions of views.The viral spread of the video has forced major platforms to respond, with varying approaches. Musk-owned X’s official policy prohibits “excessively gory” content but allows it to be posted with a warning label.The company posted online that it “will continue to stand against violence and censorship, ensuring this platform amplifies truth and open dialogue for everyone.”Google-owned YouTube said that the platform is removing some graphic content and applying age restrictions to other videos to prevent them from being seen by users under 18.“Our hearts are with Charlie Kirk’s family following his tragic death. We are closely monitoring our platform and prominently elevating news content on the homepage, in search and in recommendations to help people stay informed,” the spokesman was quoted as saying.Meta – the parent company of Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp and Threads – declined to comment but some clips on its platforms were found to have been marked as sensitive, while others were not, the report said.Experts say this event continues a long-standing and troubling trend, adding that the proliferation of violent content has become a grim fixture of the internet.“This is the first time such a widely recognised figure has been murdered in such a public way and spread this way on social media,” said Emerson Brooking, director of strategy at the Digital Forensic Research Lab of the Atlantic Council.","Graphic videos of the incident quickly went viral across major social media platforms, sparking renewed scrutiny over content moderation policies.

Trump ally and conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was fatally shot Thursday during a college event, had previously compared abortion to the Holocaust.In a resurfaced video, Kirk stated, ""We allow the massacre of a million and a half babies a year under the guise of women's reproductive health. We are allowing babies to be taken away and discarded every single year, just saying they are not humans. """"You are using dehumanizing language, saying ‘oh, it’s an embryo’; no, that's a baby, made in the image of God, deserving protection.

In fact, it is worse. It's worse.""In another exchange that has drawn attention online, Kirk was asked how he would respond if his 10-year-old daughter were raped and became pregnant. He answered, ""The answer is yes, the baby would be delivered.""Just days before his death, during an appearance on Laura Ingraham’s Fox News show, Kirk claimed that young women do not value having children.

Poll What is the most important change Nepal needs right now? Strong anti-corruption measures Political stability and peace

Gen Z protest, government overthrow

The protests were led mainly by Nepali youth aged 13 to 28, collectively known as Generation Z, mobilising through social media channels such as TikTok, Instagram, and Telegram.

Demonstrators opposed what they considered systemic corruption, restrictions on freedoms, and the elite's lavish lifestyles epitomised by ""Nepo Kids"" — children of established politicians flaunting wealth openly.

The demonstrations escalated violently over days, leading to clashes with security forces, destruction of government property including Parliament, and the loss of at least 29 lives.

Despite calls from many original activists to maintain peaceful protests, opportunistic elements infiltrated and intensified violence and chaos during the unrest.

Oli's resignation

Amid mounting pressure and escalating violence, PM Oli resigned on September 9, citing the extraordinary situation in the country and the need to facilitate a political resolution.

Oli's resignation was followed by nationwide curfews enforced by the Nepal army, which took control of security to restore order.

The resignation has created a political vacuum and initiated a search for an interim government to steer Nepal until fresh elections.

Sushila Karki & Balen Shah

Former Chief Justice Sushila Karki, known for her firm anti-corruption stance, was reportedly chosen by the Gen Z movement initially to lead an interim government.

Karki, who has expressed admiration for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and pledged to strengthen Nepal-India relations, accepted the Gen Z mandate to serve in this role.

However, her role as leader faced challenges from other contenders and evolving political dynamics.

Kathmandu mayor Balen Shah was also touted as a possible contender. He backed Karki for the role

Kulman Ghising: The new front-runner

54-year-old Kulman Ghising, former managing director of the Nepal Electricity Authority, has emerged as the strongest candidate for Nepal’s interim Prime Minister.

Ghising is widely respected for his successful work in ending Nepal’s longstanding nationwide electricity load-shedding crisis, earning him a reputation as a clean and capable technocratic leader.

Unlike traditional politicians, Ghising is seen as apolitical and pragmatic, which resonates with the Gen Z protesters' demand for a government free from corruption and political nepotism.

After Sushila Karki and Kathmandu Mayor Balendra Shah stepped aside, the Gen Z movement formally backed Ghising to lead the interim council.

Kulman Ghising was born on November 25, 1970, in Bethan village, Ramechhap District, Nepal, and comes from a humble rural background, which shaped his grounded and persevering nature.

He holds a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from the Regional Institute of Technology in Jamshedpur, India, a Master's in Power Systems from Pulchowk Engineering College, Kathmandu, and an MBA from Pokhara University, equipping him with strong technical and managerial expertise.

Ghising joined the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) in 1994 as an electrical engineer and held various technical and administrative positions over two decades, including project chief of the Rahughat Hydroelectricity Project and managing director of the Chilime Hydropower Company.

Appointed Managing Director of NEA in September 2016, he took charge when Nepal was enduring up to 18 hours of daily load-shedding (power cuts), which affected the economy and quality of life nationwide.

Under his tenure, NEA became profitable for the first time, and Nepal effectively ended load-shedding in urban areas by early 2017, a monumental achievement that restored electricity 24/7 to major cities and significantly reduced outages nationwide.

What lies ahead

The Nepal army remains key in maintaining peace and overseeing the transition.

Gen Z protesters continue to demand immediate political reforms including new constitutional provisions to prevent political entrenchment and corruption.

The interim government led by Ghising, if appointed, will be tasked with guiding Nepal through this turbulent transition to new elections and democratic renewal.

What Nepal citizens are saying

""I feel there should be an election soonest and new leaders who are able to work for the country should be elected,” said Sanu Bohara, a shop owner. “After all this what we need is peace. I feel there should not have been so much destruction, but that has already happed.”

Anup Keshar Thapa, a retired government officer who was looking at the charred official residences of ministers, said it was not clear who would lead the country and if people would actually listen to them. “If the protests had gone in an organized way, it would be clear who was leading,"" he said.





Nepal is witnessing the aftermath of a dramatic political upheaval triggered by a Gen Z-led mass protest movement that recently forced the resignation of prime minister KP Sharma Oli.The protests began primarily as a reaction to Oli's government's ban on several social media platforms but quickly evolved into a broader anti-corruption and political reform uprising.When the protests prompted Oli to resign, the country’s ceremonial president Ram Chandra Poudel asked him to lead a transitional government until a new one could be put in place.But Oli fled from his official residence, and his whereabouts were not clear.Here are 10 key points to understand the current situation and Kulman Ghising's emerging role as a front-runner to lead Nepal's next government.","Prime Minister Oli resigned on September 9, citing the extraordinary situation in the country and the need to facilitate a political resolution.

Musk expressed his shock and grief in a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter). “The shot looked real bad, but I sure hope Charlie makes it somehow,” the tech billionaire wrote as the news broke out.A couple of X users pointed out that posts on Bluesky are “celebrating the assassination”. The Tesla CEO responded saying “shows what we’re dealing with.

US President Donald Trump on Thursday sharply criticized Brazil’s Supreme Court for sentencing former President Jair Bolsonaro to 27 years and three months in prison for attempting to overturn the country’s 2022 election results. He called the ruling “very surprising” and made vague references to his own legal battles in the United States.“I watched that trial. I know him pretty well — foreign leader. I thought he was a good president of Brazil. And it’s very surprising that that could happen,” Trump told reporters at the White House, while addressing possibility of further sanctions over the sentencing. “That’s very much like they tried to do with me, but they didn’t get away with it at all. But I can always say this: I knew him as president of Brazil. He was a good man, and I don't see that happening. ""Trump went further, saying, “Jair Bolsonaro was an outstanding leader. Now, it’s a terrible thing for Brazil.” He stopped short of confirming whether Washington would impose new penalties on Brazil, saying only that he was “very unhappy” with the verdict.Trump has been openly supportive of Bolsonaro since the early stages of the trial, even going ahead on imposing tariffs on Brazil for the current government's action against the former president.US earlier this year imposed a 50 per cent tariff on Brazilian goods.Trump had also spoke nagainst the Brazil government and the judiciary over the trial. He sanctioned Brazilian supreme court Justice Alexandre de Moraes in July, alleging a politically motivated trial.The conviction — a historic first for a former Brazilian head of state — followed a trial in which four of five justices found Bolsonaro guilty of five charges, including plotting to abolish the rule of law, belonging to an armed criminal organization, and inciting violence. Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who oversaw the case, branded Bolsonaro the leader of a “criminal coup plot,” while Justice Cármen Lúcia said evidence showed he “orchestrated every possible move to maintain or seize power. ”Bolsonaro, who has denied wrongdoing, remains under house arrest in Brasília and can appeal, though legal experts say such challenges rarely succeed. The court has 60 days to publish its ruling, after which his legal team will have five days to file motions for clarification.The White House response marks an escalation in already tense US-Brazil relations. Secretary of State Marco Rubio condemned the verdict as a “witch hunt” on X, vowing the administration would “respond accordingly.”Inside Brazil, the ruling has deepened political rifts. Supporters of the far-right leader rallied in major cities, denouncing what they called political persecution. His eldest son, Sen. Flávio Bolsonaro, described the decision as “supreme persecution,” insisting that “history would vindicate his father.”President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who defeated Bolsonaro in 2022, defended the verdict, saying “hundreds of pieces of evidence” proved that Bolsonaro attempted a coup against Brazil’s democracy.Bolsonaro, already barred from holding office until 2030 in a separate case, is expected to remain a powerful political figure. Observers say he will likely back an ally to challenge Lula in Brazil’s next election, even as the country navigates the turbulence of his conviction and the prospect of international fallout.",Jair Bolsonaro was sentenced to 27 years and three months in prison for attempting to overturn the country’s 2022 election results.

Charlie Kirk, one of Donald Trump ’s most loyal allies and the co-founder of conservative youth group Turning Point USA, was fatally shot on Wednesday while addressing students at Utah Valley University.The 31-year-old political activist, who was known as a top podcaster and a leading culture warrior, was speaking about gun violence when he was killed. The attack has shocked American politics, bringing fresh focus on security around political figures.Authorities shared images of a person in a hat, sunglasses and black long-sleeve shirt with a backpack, seen fleeing the scene. Investigators are appealing for public help to track this suspect.US vice president JD Vance accompanied Kirk’s flag-draped casket aboard Air Force Two to Arizona. His wife Usha Vance walked hand-in-hand with Kirk’s widow Erika, who the couple’s two children joined. On arrival, Phoenix air traffic control broadcast, “Welcome home, Charlie. You didn’t deserve it… May God bless your family.”In the aftermath of the brutal incident, additional security was arranged around Donald Trump.A Pentagon 9/11 ceremony was moved indoors, and extra measures were added for his visit to Yankee Stadium. Asked if he feared for his safety, Trump said, “not really.”Investigators are offering up to $100,000 for information leading to the suspect’s arrest. A bolt-action rifle believed to have been used in the attack was recovered nearby, along with spent and live rounds. The weapon is under analysis at a federal lab.Authorities revealed the shooter left behind footprints and a palm print while fleeing across the campus roof and into the woods. The rifle was also found wrapped in a towel, providing investigators with critical evidence.FBI Director Kash Patel initially said a suspect in Charlie Kirk’s shooting was “in custody,” but the person was later released. Critics called the statement premature and unprofessional. Patel stressed the investigation is ongoing, with a reward offered and images of a person of interest released. “We have people all over the country trying to bring this perpetrator to justice,” he said, noting the FBI has received over 7,000 leads and tips.Secretary of War Pete Hegseth paid tribute, saying, “We lost an incredible American today.” He offered prayers in front of a platoon of soldiers.The shooting occurred during the first stop of Kirk’s “American Comeback Tour” at the Sorensen Centre. The event had sparked petitions and debate, but the university defended its decision to host him on free speech grounds.Donald Trump led tributes after Charlie Kirk’s fatal shooting, calling him “a great guy from top to bottom. GOD BLESS HIM!” and ordering flags to be flown at half-staff. Former President Barack Obama also condemned the violence, saying it had “no place in our democracy” while sending prayers to Kirk’s family. California governor Gavin Newsom, who had once hosted Kirk on his podcast, described the killing as “sick, disgusting and reprehensible,” urging the need for civil discourse even amid political divides.Other senior figures across the spectrum also expressed shock. Former vice-president Kamala Harris said she and her husband were “deeply disturbed” and stressed that political violence should have no place in America. Senator Elizabeth Warren called the shooting “nothing short of horrific,” offering sympathy to Kirk’s family and students present at the event.Kirk’s organisation released a video montage of his life captioned: “A Life of Faith, A Legacy That Endures: Remembering Charlie Kirk.” Founded in 2012, TPUSA has been a strong force in shaping right-wing youth activism in the US.","Charlie Kirk, 31, was fatally shot on Wednesday while addressing students at Utah Valley University.

A 50-year-old Indian-origin man, Chandramouli Nagamallaiah, was brutally beheaded in front of his wife and son during a violent dispute at a Dallas motel in US, police said.The attack took place on the morning of September 10 at the Downtown Suites motel on Samuell Boulevard, east of Downtown Dallas.According to Police, the suspect, 37-year-old Yordanis Cobos-Martinez, beheaded Nagamallaiah in front of his wife and son during a violent confrontation. Cobos-Martinez, who also worked at the motel, has been arrested and charged with capital murder.According to an arrest affidavit released Thursday, the attack stemmed from an argument over the use of a broken washing machine.Nagamallaiah had reportedly told Cobos-Martinez and a female colleague not to use it while they were cleaning a motel room, CBS news reported.The affidavit notes Cobos-Martinez became upset because the victim relayed the message through the female colleague, who acted as a translator, rather than addressing him directly.According to CBS news, video evidence cited in the affidavit shows Cobos-Martinez leaving the room, pulling a machete “from his person,” and attacking Nagamallaiah.A witness, another motel employee, told police, “He chased him from 108 all the way to the office.The man was trying to get into the office to tell his family.”Nagamallaiah ran screaming toward the motel office where his wife and son were present. They tried to intervene multiple times, but police said Cobos-Martinez pushed them aside and continued the assault.Investigators said the suspect then removed Nagamallaiah’s cell phone and key card before resuming the attack until the victim’s head “was removed from his body.”The affidavit adds that Cobos-Martinez kicked the victim’s head twice into the parking lot before picking it up, carrying it to a dumpster, and placing it inside.Images from the scene showed crime scene tape surrounding the motel and a partition near a body on the sidewalk.Dallas Fire-Rescue crews arriving at the scene spotted Cobos-Martinez still carrying the machete and covered in blood. They followed him until police arrived and arrested him.During interrogation, police said Cobos-Martinez admitted to the crime. He is now being held at Dallas County Jail on a capital murder charge, with records also showing an immigration hold.According to records, Cobos-Martinez has a criminal history, including arrests for auto theft in Florida, as well as charges of assault and indecency with a child in Houston.","Chandramouli Nagamallaiah, 50, was brutally beheaded in front of his wife and son during a violent dispute at a Dallas motel in US, police said.

Charlie Kirk 'ASSASSIN' On Cam: FBI Releases Photos Of Shooting Suspect | BREAKING NEWS





Members of the European Parliament rejected a request on Thursday to hold a moment of silence for Charlie Kirk, the 31-year-old conservative activist who was shot dead Wednesday while speaking at Utah Valley University.Swedish MEP Charlie Weimers, from the European Conservatives and Reformists group, asked the chamber to pause proceedings to “declare that our right to freedom of speech cannot be extinguished,” quoted Euro News.The request was supported by lawmakers from Germany’s AfD and France’s Identity Liberties movement.However, European Parliament president Roberta Metsola denied the request, citing procedural rules that require tributes to be formally submitted at the opening of a plenary session. Since Monday’s session had already passed, she said a tribute could be scheduled in October.When Weimers gave up his remaining speaking time to call for a moment of silence, Vice president Katarina Barley interrupted him, prompting protests from right-wing MEPs.Barley said, “We have discussed this, and you know the president said no to a minute of silence,” while centrist and left-leaning members clapped.Outside the chamber, Hungarian MEP András László criticised the parliament, noting it had previously honoured George Floyd but refused Kirk.Some lawmakers also shared “I am Charlie” posts online, echoing the slogan from the 2015 Charlie Hebdo attack.Metsola further defended the decision as following parliamentary rules and offered condolences. “Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife and young children, who were the bedrock of his life,” she said.","Members of the European Parliament rejected a request on Thursday to hold a moment of silence for Charlie Kirk.

Trump Announces 'Medal Of Freedom' Award For Charlie Kirk As JD Vance Meets Family After Shooting





US vice president JD Vance on Wednesday posted a heartfelt tribute to Charlie Kirk on social media, calling him “a true friend” and a major influence in his rise in national politics.Kirk, the conservative activist who was shot dead Wednesday at Utah Valley University, helped shape Vance’s path from a MAGA outsider to the vice presidency.“Charlie was fascinated by ideas and always willing to learn and change his mind,” Vance wrote.“Like me, he was skeptical of Donald Trump in 2016. Like me, he came to see president Trump as the only figure capable of moving American politics away from the globalism that had dominated for our entire lives. When others were right, he learned from them. When he was right — as he usually was — he was generous.”Vance said Kirk was crucial to his 2022 Senate campaign in Ohio, helping with strategy, fundraising and grassroots connections.“He introduced me to some of the people who would run my campaign and also to Donald Trump Jr, who took a call from me because Charlie asked,” Vance wrote.Kirk also remained deeply involved with Vance’s family. “Our kids, especially our oldest, struggled with the attention and the constant presence of the protective detail. I felt this acute sense of guilt, that I had conscripted my kids into this life without getting their permission.And Charlie was constantly calling and texting, checking on our family and offering guidance and prayers.”Vance recalled learning about Kirk’s shooting through group messages with friends and government officials. “God didn’t answer those prayers, and that’s ok. He had other plans. And now that Charlie is in heaven, I’ll ask him to talk to (the) big man directly on behalf of his family, his friends, and the country he loved so dearly.”Vance and his wife Usha accompanied the conservative activist on his final flight home.

Legal implications and future outlook





A 23-year-old British law student from Merseyside has been sentenced to 25 years in Dubai’s Central Prison after being convicted of drug trafficking. Caught with 50 grams of cocaine, Mia O’Brien now faces a future behind bars in one of the region’s most notorious prisons, as her family back home scrambles for support.Mia O’Brien, a law student from Liverpool University and resident of Huyton, Merseyside, was arrested in October after authorities allegedly discovered 50 grams of cocaine in her Dubai apartment. The drugs were found in a single large lump, and local officials charged her with drug dealing — a serious offence under the United Arab Emirates’ strict narcotics laws.O’Brien was arrested alongside a female friend and the friend’s boyfriend. All three faced similar drug charges. Despite pleading not guilty, Mia was convicted during a swift one-day court hearing on July 25. The judge sentenced her to 25 years in prison — often classified under UAE law as a life sentence — and imposed a fine of £100,000.According to estimates, the street value of the seized cocaine would be around £2,500 in the UK.Following her sentencing, Mia was transferred to Dubai Central Prison, a facility widely known for its harsh and often brutal conditions.Reports from previous years describe a system plagued by overcrowding, abuse, and systemic violence.According to her mother, Danielle McKenna, Mia is currently held in a cramped cell with six other inmates, most of whom are Nigerian nationals. She described her daughter’s emotional state as “absolutely devastated,” noting that Mia had always dreamed of becoming a lawyer or solicitor before this incident drastically altered her life path.Communication with Mia has been limited and closely monitored. “I speak to her but she can't say too much on the phone,” her mother said. Conditions inside the prison are reported to be extreme — with torture used to extract confessions and frequent accounts of rape and violence, both from inmates and prison staff.In an effort to bring her daughter home or improve her legal situation, Danielle McKenna launched a fundraising campaign on GoFundMe. However, the platform removed the page on Friday, citing violations of its Terms of Service.A GoFundMe spokesperson explained the takedown, referencing Term 9 of their Prohibited Conduct policy: “It was removed because it violates Term 9 of the Prohibited Conduct section in our Terms of Service. Term 9 prohibits raising funds on GoFundMe for the legal defense of certain alleged crimes.”In response, Danielle turned to social media to continue seeking help. She shared her personal bank details on Facebook, urging people to send donations directly. Explaining her move, she wrote: “I am going to set up my own, as they [GoFundMe] are nitpicking at everything.” She also noted that direct contributions would avoid platform fees: “This way I get to keep everything.”Despite the setback, she thanked those who had shown support: “I would just like to thank everyone.”On the original GoFundMe page, she had described Mia as a bright and well-meaning young woman who had fallen in with the wrong crowd:“Mia is only 23 years old and has never done a bad thing in her life. This is a young girl, who went to university to do law, and unfortunately got mixed up in the wrong so-called friends and made a very stupid mistake and is now paying the price.”Under UAE law, drug trafficking carries extremely severe penalties, including life imprisonment or, in rare cases, the death penalty. While Mia’s 25-year sentence is considered a “life sentence” under Emirati legal definitions, her family still hopes to reduce or overturn the decision through appeal or intervention.As of now, no official UK government statement has been made regarding diplomatic efforts in Mia’s case. However, past instances have seen British consular support offered in cases involving citizens jailed abroad.The case serves as a stark reminder of the strict anti-drug laws in the Middle East and the life-altering consequences that can arise from even a single misstep.","Mia O’Brien, a 23-year-old law student from Merseyside, was arrested in October.

US condemns decision, warns of response



Divided Brazil, inflamed politics



Bolsonaro’s future







Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro was sentenced to 27 years and three months in prison on Thursday after the country’s Supreme Court convicted him of attempting a coup to remain in power following his 2022 electoral defeat to President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.The unprecedented ruling handed down by a panel of five justices, four of whom voted to convict, makes Bolsonaro the first former Brazilian leader found guilty of trying to overturn a democratic election. He was convicted on five counts, including plotting to abolish the rule of law, belonging to an armed criminal organisation, and inciting violence.Bolsonaro, who has consistently denied wrongdoing, remains under house arrest in Brasilia. He can still appeal the decision. The court now has 60 days to publish the ruling, after which his lawyers will have five days to file motions for clarification. Legal experts say such appeals rarely change outcomes.The ruling immediately sparked international backlash, most notably from Washington. US President Donald Trump said he was “very unhappy” with the conviction, calling Bolsonaro “outstanding.”Secretary of state Marco Rubio denounced the ruling as a “witch hunt” in a post on X, vowing the Trump administration would “respond accordingly.”The United States had already slapped a 50 per cent tariff on Brazilian goods earlier this year, citing the case against Bolsonaro — a move analysts say foreshadowed further sanctions.In Brazil, the trial has inflamed political tensions. Supporters of the far-right leader have taken to the streets, claiming the case is political persecution. His eldest son, Sen. Flávio Bolsonaro, called the verdict a “supreme persecution,” insisting history would vindicate his father.Justice Cármen Lúcia, siding with the majority, said she was persuaded by evidence from the Attorney General’s Office. “He is the instigator, the leader of an organisation that orchestrated every possible move to maintain or seize power,” she said. Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who oversaw the case, branded Bolsonaro the head of a criminal coup plot.President Lula said Thursday that “hundreds of pieces of evidence” showed Bolsonaro attempted a coup against Brazil’s democracy.Bolsonaro is already barred from running for office until 2030 in a separate case, but he remains an influential figure in Brazilian politics. Observers expect him to back a political heir to challenge Lula in the next election.Despite Thursday’s ruling, Bolsonaro will not immediately go to prison. But with appeals unlikely to succeed and diplomatic tensions rising, Brazil now faces a volatile period of political and international fallout.","Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro sentenced to 27 years and three months in prison.
