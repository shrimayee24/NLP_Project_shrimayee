Hidma's death may help forces end Naxalism by Amit Shah deadline,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hidmas-death-may-help-forces-end-naxalism-by-amit-shah-deadline/articleshow/125423773.cms,"The Ghost Of Bastar Falls: What Madvi Hidma’s Death Means For India’s War Against Maoist Insurgency

Was he ready to surrender when he was shot?

NEW DELHI: The neutralisation of Madvi Hidma, the youngest CPI (Maoist) central committee member and yet its most dreaded military commander, came 12 days ahead of the Nov 30, 2025 deadline set by home minister Amit Shah for the counter-Naxal forces to end his terror run. Hidma's exit may have brought the security establishment realistically close to achieving the March 31, 2026 goal set by home minister Amit Shah for eliminating left-wing extremist violence from the country.As on date, the CPI (Maoist) central committee's strength stands eroded to seven, including the three politburo members Thippiri Tirupathi alias Devji, Muppalla Laxman Rao alias Ganpathy and Misir Besra. Ganapathy is in his seventies and Misir Besra confined to a small area in Jharkhand with little cadre strength. The remaining four 'active' CC members are Ganesh Uikey, Anal Da, Malla Raji Reddy alias Sangram and Ramder.Sources told TOI that after Shah declared last year that Naxalism shall be uprooted by March 31, 2026, he has been giving the security forces mini-goals or milestones to be achieved along the way. These milestones could be freeing a certain area from Maoists' hold or tackling the top CPI (Maoist) leadership by getting them to surrender or, where unwilling, neutralising them in intelligence-based operations. Sources said Shah, while chairing recent reviews on left-wing extremism, had directed the forces to neutralise Hidma latest by Nov 30.Hidma, who had commanded the dreaded Battalion No 1 of the Peoples' Liberation Guerrilla Army (PLGA) before passing on the baton to Barse Deva, was the only Bastar tribal to be anointed to CC.The forces had been on his trail for years but Hidma remained elusive. Though Chhattisgarh deputy CM Vijay Sharma had on Nov 10 approached Hidma's mother to appeal to him to surrender, he did not respond.The killing of Hidma, given how crucial he was to CPI (Maoist)'s operational capabilities, ""is a historic milestone in the fight against left wing extremism,"" IG, Bastar Range Sundarraj P told TOI. He said the remaining Maoist leaders of concern are Devji, Sangram, Ganesh Uikey, Ramder as well as Barse Deva and Pappa Rao. The assessment is that no more than 100-150 uniformed, armed, full-time Maoist cadres may be active, possibly in the National Park area, Gariyaband or inter-state borders of Chhattisgarh-Telangana and Andhra-Odisha. ""Some may surrender after Hidma's killing. But those who don't, shall be confronted by the security forces,"" he said.The year 2025 has dealt a debilitating blow to the Maoists, with many top leaders killed or having surrendered. The most prominent PB leader to be eliminated was general secretary Nambala Keshav Rao, while Mallujola Venugopal Rao alias Sonu surrendered. The CC members neutralised this year include Kadari Satyanarayan Reddy, Katta Ramchandra Reddy, Chalapati, Gajrala Ravi, Vivek Chandri Yadav and Thentu Laxmi. Other CC members who surrendered are Sujata, Chandranna and Rupesh.Telangana cops said Hidma had dropped enough hints about a possible surrender and they were working on it. Chhattisgarh deputy CM Vijay Sharma had met his mother, after which she strongly urged Hidma to give up arms. A Bastar journalist said Hidma wrote to him last week that he was considering surrender and sought help to negotiate with the govt.","Madvi Hidma was the youngest CPI (Maoist) central committee member and yet its most dreaded military commander.

President Donald Trump has confirmed that the United States will sell advanced F-35 stealth fighter jets to Saudi Arabia, marking a major policy shift that has raised alarm among Israeli and Indian officials over regional security implications.“I will say that we will be doing that, we’ll be selling F-35s,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on November 17, one day before hosting Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House. The announcement came despite concerns from Pentagon intelligence officials and key regional allies about the potential consequences of the sale.Saudi Arabia has requested to purchase as many as 48 F-35 fighters in what would be a multibillion-dollar deal with Lockheed Martin, making it the first Arab military to acquire the fifth-generation stealth aircraft.Until now, Israel has been the only country in the Middle East operating F-35s.The Israeli Defense Forces delivered a formal position paper to political leadership on November 17 objecting to the sale, warning it could undermine Israel’s qualitative military edge in the region. The document stated that Israel’s air superiority depends on maintaining exclusive access to fifth-generation stealth aircraft, with long-range covert operations relying on that exclusivity.“Israel’s air superiority in the Middle East depends on maintaining exclusive access to fifth-generation stealth aircraft,” according to the IDF assessment obtained by Ynet. The military also warned that Saudi F-35 purchases could occupy production lines and delay Israeli orders for additional squadrons.Under US law, Israel is guaranteed weapons needed to maintain its qualitative military edge over Arab nations, though Trump administration officials have indicated they can provide assurances without specifying what additional capabilities would be offered to Israel.A Defense Intelligence Agency report warned that China could acquire the F-35's advanced technology if the sale proceeds, citing Beijing's defense ties with Riyadh. China is now Saudi Arabia's largest trading partner, and the two countries conducted joint naval exercises in recent years.India has also expressed concern about the potential transfer, particularly given a recent defense pact between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan stipulating that an attack on either nation would be considered an attack on both. Analysts warn the deal could enable Pakistan to gain indirect access to advanced US military equipment through Saudi Arabia.One Indian defense analyst told media outlets, “A Saudi F-35 fleet would strengthen Saudi Arabia’s air dominance, compelling regional rivals and other near-neighbors, including India, to reassess air and missile defense postures”. The introduction of such technology could trigger a fresh arms race across the Middle East and South Asia.",Saudi Arabia has requested to purchase as many as 48 F-35 fighters in what would be a multibillion-dollar deal with Lockheed Martin.

‘Nitish Still X-Factor’ Pavan Verma Decodes Why Jan Suraaj Couldn’t Break Through in Bihar Polls

NEW DELHI: Jan Suraaj supremo Prashant Kishor on Tuesday said he takes '100 per cent responsibility' for his party’s poor performance in the 2025 Bihar Assembly elections. This was his first reaction after the poll verdict.Interacting with reporters in Patna, Kishor admitted: “We made an honest effort, but it was completely unsuccessful. There’s no harm in admitting this. Forget about systemic change; we couldn’t even bring about a change in power. But we certainly played some role in changing Bihar’s politics… There must have been some mistake in our efforts, in our thinking, in the way we explained that the public had not elected us. If the public did not show faith in us, then the responsibility for that is completely mine. I take that responsibility 100% on myself, that I could not win the faith of the people of Bihar.”Kishor has also vowed to observe a ‘maun upvas’ (vow of silence) for “failing to change the government”. As an act of atonement, he announced that he will undertake a day-long silent fast at the Gandhi Bhitiharwa Ashram on November 20.""I will work twice as hard as you've seen me work over the past three years and put in all my energy. There's no question of backing down. There's no turning back until I fulfil my resolve to make Bihar better. I failed to explain to the people of Bihar the basis on which they should vote and why they should create a new system. Therefore, as atonement, I will observe a day-long silent fast at the Gandhi Bhitiharwa Ashram on November 20th,"" Kishor said.The Jan Suraaj Party got 0 seats in the election, a stunning outcome for a new entrant once pitched as the “third force” in the bitterly contested battle between the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which secured 202 seats and the Mahagathbandhan (MGB), which won 35.Responding to questions on whether he would resign after the defeat, Kishor dismissed the idea. The Jan Suraaj chief said that he was not holding any official post to step down from.“What position am I holding that I should resign? I had said that if (JDU) gets more than 25 seats, I will retire. From which position should I resign? I did not say that I will leave Bihar. I have left politics. I do not do politics, but I did not say that I will stop speaking for the people of Bihar,” he said.Kishor also vowed to continue his campaign in Bihar with greater determination despite the setback. He said he would intensify his efforts on the ground and not retreat from his mission to reform the state.""I will work twice as hard as you've seen me work over the past three years and put in all my energy. There's no question of backing down. There's no turning back until I fulfil my resolve to make Bihar better,” he said.He further acknowledged shortcomings in communicating his message to voters and said he would atone for it with a symbolic gesture.“I failed to explain to the people of Bihar the basis on which they should vote and why they should create a new system. Therefore, as atonement, I will observe a day-long silent fast at the Gandhi Bhitiharwa Ashram on November 20th... We may have made mistakes, but we have not committed any crime. We have not committed the crime of spreading caste-based poison in society. We have not played Hindu-Muslim politics in Bihar. We have not committed the crime of dividing people in the name of religion. We have not committed the crime of giving money to the poor, innocent people of Bihar and buying their votes,"" Kishor added.For years, Prashant Kishor was regarded as one of India’s most successful political strategists and was known as the man behind a string of high-profile electoral wins.But his most anticipated venture, Jan Suraaj, has turned into a spectacular failure. Launched after an extended “padyatra” in Bihar, the party fielded 236 candidates, drawing heavily on social-media outreach and promising a new brand of politics focused on meritocracy, youth migration, jobs and improved governance.Despite the high-profile campaign, the party lost its deposit in 236 of the 238 seats it contested. While Jan Suraaj had staked much on converting social-media traction into votes, the strategy evidently faltered in a state where caste affiliation, local networks and long-standing alliances retain deep influence.The Bihar Assembly elections were conducted in two phases on November 6 and November 11, with the results declared on November 14.","Prashant Kishor says he takes '100 per cent responsibility' for his party's poor performance in the 2025 Bihar Assembly elections.

NEW DELHI: Janshakti Janta Dal founder Tej Pratap Yadav on Tuesday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah to investigate allegations of “mental and physical pressure” on his parents, RJD patriarch Lalu Prasad and former chief minister Rabri Devi.Calling it an attack on the ""very soul"" of RJD, Tej Pratap alleged that ""certain traitors"" are destroying both the ""family and the organisation"" in an apparent reference to Sanjay Yadav, Rameez Nemat Khan, both aides of Tejashwi Yadav.""It is being said that some people, Jaichands, are making attempts to keep my parents Lalu Prasad ji and my mother under mental and physical pressure.

She claimed she had been “driven out” of her parents’ home by associates of Tejashwi Yadav following the RJD’s poor showing in the Bihar assembly polls.Rohini, who donated a kidney to Lalu Prasad a few years ago and unsuccessfully contested the Saran Lok Sabha seat last year, expressed anguish over being accused of exploiting her medical sacrifice. In an emotional post, she said she had acted “without caring for the approval of my husband and my in-laws or for the well-being of my three children”.","Janshakti Janta Dal founder Tej Pratap Yadav on Tuesday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah to investigate allegations of ""mental and physical pressure"" on his parents.

Calm And Radical: Dr Umar’s Pre-Blast Video Exposes Educated New Face Of Terror Behind Delhi Attack

NEW DELHI: BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla on Tuesday launched a sharp attack on the Congress after its MP Imran Masood referred to suicide bomber Umar Un Nabi as a “misguided youth”.Accusing the Opposition party of prioritising “vote bank niti over rashtra niti”, he said the Congress had repeatedly attempted to soften the perception of terror acts for political gain.Reacting to Congress leader's remarks, Poonawalla wrote on X: ""On a day that a chilling new video of suicide bomber Umar Nabi has emerged where he is seen justifying his act of terror before carrying out the attack near Delhi's Red Fort, Congress MP Imran Masood calls him “bhatka hua yuva” (misguided youth).""The Congress MP has described suicide bomber Umar Un Nabi as a “misguided youth”, stressing that his actions were against both Islam and the nation.“The video that has come (of accused Umar Ul Nabi), I do not agree with that video at all. Suicide is not permissible in Islam under any circumstances. By killing innocent people along with yourself, you are acting against the country. These are misguided people whose words cannot present the picture of Islam,” he said speaking to reporters.Investigators recovered the footage during the probe, in which Umar Un Nabi is seen calmly defending what he calls a “martyrdom operation,” an attempt to justify the suicide blast he would later execute near the Red Fort.In the undated video, he argues that suicide attacks are “misunderstood” and claims such operations are carried out with absolute certainty of death as an act of religious duty.Sitting alone in a room, he speaks without hesitation, insisting that the act he is preparing for should not be viewed as suicide, but as a form of martyrdom. Officials believe the video was created to brainwash others and radicalise more educated youth into joining the terror module.Poonawalla also alleged that other Opposition leaders had done the same in the past by downplaying terror and defending those involved in such acts.“Earlier Hussain Dalwai, Chidambaram, Mehbooba Mufti, Tariq Anwar, Abu Azmi of SP labelled the terrorists as innocent or justified their acts by saying ‘circumstances’ were responsible,” Poonwalla further wrote in his post.Poonawalla alleged that the Congress has a long history of downplaying terror for political gain and pointed to past instances to support his charge.He further wrote on X: “This is nothing but keeping Votebank Niti above Rashtra Niti. Congress has become Muslim League Maowadi Congress. From defending Afzal & Yakub & Batla terrorists to shielding Naxals and justifying Umar’s actions.”Last week, former home minister P Chidambaram had questioned the Centre over what he called the rising threat of “homegrown terrorism” following the arrests linked to the blast.Similarly, PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti had alleged that the government was projecting “false normalcy” in Jammu & Kashmir and claimed the national security situation had worsened, citing the Red Fort incident as an example.The Red Fort blast on November 10 killed 15 people and injured several others.

J&K Police Confirm 9 Killed in Nowgam Blast After Explosives Recovered From Faridabad Blows Up

SRINAGAR: A thunderclap of fire, concrete, and smoke tore through Nowgam police station in Srinagar’s upscale Sheikhpora neighbourhood close to 11.30pm on Nov 14. While sirens lagged behind, a hospital guard and a cook were already on the move.Ulfat Dar, a young guard at Ujala Cygnus Hospital nearly a km away, saw the orange flare crest the skyline after the explosion. He thought it was a cylinder blast. He still ran. “Drive,” he told Waseem, a hospital cook. They swung an ambulance towards the station.“They were among the first to reach,” Ujala Cygnus manager Dr Parvez Sofi said Tuesday. In their first dash they hauled eight wounded policemen out of debris and flame. More followed in two additional runs. On the last, they pried free a trapped officer whose legs were pinned under a slab. He lived.Sofi rushed from his Hyderpora home, 10km away. When he arrived, Ulfat and Waseem had already crowded the emergency floor with casualties. “Blood everywhere. Screams,” he said. He triggered internal WhatsApp alerts. CT technicians, trauma teams, emergency physicians — everyone surged in.Doctors treated lacerations, fractures, splinter wounds, and multiple head traumas. One officer arrived with massive brain bleed. Four went to ICU. Others were stabilised. Psychologists and psychiatrists were later pressed into service as several officers sat mute for hours, some suffering ear injuries from pressure waves.Senior officers visited and offered backup beds in govt hospitals. “We told them we could handle it,” Sofi said. By dawn, the count stood at 23 patients. Most are expected to be discharged in coming days.Sofi has worked mass-casualty wards before — he recalls 2008 at Govt Bone and Joint Hospital in Srinagar — but said nothing equalled the force of Friday night. “I’m used to trauma,” he said. “This was horrifying.”Ujala Cygnus has stepped into crises before. In April, when a CRPF bus skidded near Doodhpathri in Budgam, the hospital received every injured trooper and referred none. On Tuesday, J&K CM Omar Abdullah stopped by to meet the wounded policemen.What Sofi remembers most this time is not the rubble, or the blood, or the screams. It’s the scene that came before all that: a guard and a cook steering an ambulance straight towards a blast.","A powerful explosion rocked Nowgam police station in Srinagar, prompting an immediate response from a hospital guard and cook who rushed wounded officers to Ujala Cygnus Hospital.

Why did it happen? The investigation has begun. I hope people will get answers, because this should not have happened.”The police station had recently probed alleged Jaish-e-Mohammed posters in Nowgam’s Bonpora locality on Oct 19, a case that exposed an alleged interstate terrorist module involving doctors and others. That network is linked to the Nov 10 New Delhi car blast.Omar pressed for clarity on the explosives. “How was such a large quantity brought here? Under what circumstances was it brought? In what conditions was it kept? Under what circumstances was it being handled? Slowly, we will get answers,” he said.The blast levelled the station, killing a special investigation agency officer, three forensic science laboratory personnel, two revenue officials, and a tailor attached to the premises. Thirty others — 27 policemen, two revenue staffers, and three civilians — were wounded.Omar also visited families of those killed. “This tragedy has taken away people who served with sincerity and courage. Their loss is a loss for all of Jammu & Kashmir,” he said. He promised full support to the families “in this hour of unimaginable pain.”On Monday, LG Manoj Sinha ruled out any alleged terrorist plot or outside interference. Sinha praised J&K police for dismantling what he called “a pan-India terrorist module” and said their work had “saved countless lives by preventing a series of planned attacks across the country”.He expressed “profound grief” over the Nowgam deaths. “Tragically, we lost brave J&K police personnel and officials. I extend heartfelt solidarity to the bereaved families.”","J&K CM Omar Abdullah says he is hopeful an ongoing probe would explain how a late-night blast tore through Srinagar’s Nowgam police station Friday, killing nine and wounding 30.

He said that despite several offers from the erstwhile rulers, the Guru refused to bow before tyranny and chose the path of martyrdom to defend freedom of religion.Kejriwal said Guru Tegh Bahadur is remembered across the world as the first martyr who sacrificed his life for the protection of human rights.CM Mann said Guru Tegh Bahadur's sacrifice for the protection of faith and righteousness transformed the course of India's history.He said that on this occasion, homage and deep respect are paid to Pandit Kirpa Ram, who had unwavering faith in the Sikh faith.Mann said Pandit Kirpa Ram was a resident of the town of Mattan, located about 65 kilometres from Srinagar. Kashmiri Pandits sought refuge with Guru Tegh Bahadur under Pandit Ram's leadership to protect their religion.The chief minister said it is a matter of immense pride and satisfaction that Kashmiri Pandits will also participate in the 'Nagar Kirtan' (religious procession) being organised from Srinagar, a beautiful reflection of communal harmony and brotherhood.He said the sacrifices of Guru Tegh Bahadur were not for personal gain but for the welfare of all and for truth and justice.Mann said the Khalsa was born on the sacred land of Sri Anandpur Sahib in 1699 -- 24 years after Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji's martyrdom.The chief minister said the tenth Guru, Guru Gobind Singh, sacrificed his entire family for the honour of the faith, an unparalleled example in world history.The objective of commemorating this great occasion is to spread the philosophy of Guru Tegh Bahadur throughout the world so that ideals of peace, harmony and secularism for which the Guru sacrificed himself may be preserved.Mann said those who take inspiration from their past and walk in the light of martyrdom can find rays of hope even in darkness.","Kejriwal exhorted the people to follow Guru Ji's universal message of love, secularism, religious tolerance, freedom of faith and peaceful co-existence.

Candace Owens Makes Shocking Egyptian Planes Claim In Charlie Kirk Case

Candace Owens says flight signals, rental cars, and timing raise new questions

Operation Mocking-Plane: The Charlie Kirk Plot Thickens. | Candace Ep 266





Candace Owens says she has many serious questions about the killing of Charlie Kirk. She talked about this again in her podcast on November 17. She said she found new details that made her even more worried. Candace Owens said two Egyptian planes showed up many times near Erika Kirk, Charlie Kirk’s wife. She said these planes showed up at places where Erika Kirk was 73 times from 2022 to September 2025. She said she found these numbers after checking the work of a woman online, whom she called a “pregnant mommy sleuth.”She said the woman was right. Candace Owens said 29 of those overlaps also had Charlie Kirk in the same place. She said both planes were also at the Provo airport on September 10, the day Charlie Kirk was shot near Utah Valley University. She said one plane took off, and the other stayed on the ground with its power on.Candace Owens said the two planes were the yellow SU-BTT and the blue SU-BND. She said these flights mostly matched Erika Kirk’s movements inside five U.S. states but also matched her travel overseas. She said one plane at the Provo airport sent out a signal from 9:05 a.m.until 10:34 a.m. on September 10. She said its signal turned on again 17 minutes after Charlie Kirk was shot at 12:40 p.m., and stayed on until 1:29 p.m.Candace Owens said she believed this signal came from data on ADS-B Exchange. She also said the flight was “transponding” at Duncan Aviation. She said she saw claims online from MJTruthUltra that Duncan Aviation gave rental cars to people linked to the Egyptian planes. She even read out car details and asked if anyone had seen them.Candace Owens said the plane could have been doing normal maintenance. She also said the plane might have tools to make private satellite calls.

A rebel with leverage





The Republican Party once tried to wash Donald Trump off like tear gas. In the days after 6 January 2021, senior Republicans queued up to say the quiet thing out loud. Kevin McCarthy, then House Minority Leader, admitted that the president “bears responsibility” for the mob that stormed Congress. Mitch McConnell went further and said there was “no question, none” that Trump was “practically and morally responsible” for provoking the events of that day and guilty of a “disgraceful dereliction of duty.” For a brief, trembling moment, it looked as if the party had decided to choose constitutional memory over cult loyalty. There was talk of a post-Trump Republican reboot, the donor class flirted with other names, and the commentariat rehearsed phrases like “turning the page” and “moving on.”Three years, one impeachment, and two Trump primary victories later, that righteous fury has mostly evaporated. Trump retook control of the party, the never-Trump Republicans either retired, lost primaries, or fell silent, and a long line of senators and governors who once hinted that “it is time for new leadership” found themselves back on stage, red cap in hand, mumbling that the base had spoken. Whatever the leadership might have wished on 7 January, rank-and-file Republican voters never actually left him.Inside that carefully reconstructed amnesia, Thomas Massie stands out as an oddity.He is not Liz Cheney, who converted resistance to Trump into a full-time vocation. He is not Mitt Romney, who gave a valedictory speech and left Washington shaking his head. Massie is something more awkward and therefore more interesting: a Republican who will accept Trump’s endorsement and still publicly defy him; a man who will pose for a Christmas card with his family holding assault rifles and then, in the next breath, launch a bureaucratic insurgency to force the president into a corner on one of the darkest scandals of the age.This is the story of how a solar-powered engineer from rural Kentucky became the Republican who took on Donald Trump from the right.Thomas Massie arrived in Congress in 2012 on the libertarian edge of the Tea Party wave. An MIT-trained engineer, he had made money on a tech invention, moved back home, and built the kind of off-grid, solar-powered house that makes lifestyle influencers on YouTube sound less committed than they think they are.From the start, Massie was a problem for leadership. He hated omnibus bills, continuing resolutions, and anything that looked like a blank cheque for the executive branch. He voted against foreign wars, against warrantless surveillance, against the steady fattening of the national security state. If there was a red button marked “no,” he pressed it so often that colleagues joked it must have an impression of his thumb.The defining early clash with Trump came in March 2020. As Covid ripped through the United States, Congress rushed through a two-trillion-dollar rescue package. Everyone wanted plausible deniability. The quickest way to get it was to wave the bill through on a voice vote, which would allow members to say they “supported relief” without ever having to defend a specific line item.Massie refused to play along. He insisted that a bill of that size should not pass without a recorded vote. He drove back to Washington, forced members to show up during a pandemic, and demanded that everyone either own their support or go on record as opposing it.Trump reacted like a man whose cinematic finale had been interrupted by an electrician switching the lights on. On social media, he called Massie a “third rate Grandstander,” urged Republicans to “throw Massie out of the Republican Party,” and accused him of risking lives “for publicity.” He wanted him primaried, shamed, erased.Massie survived. His deeply conservative district in northern Kentucky sent him back anyway. The attempted excommunication failed, and something important crystallised around his persona. He was now, in the eyes of both admirers and critics, the man who would walk into the chamber, ignore the party mood and the television cameras, and press the red button if he thought the state was spending money it did not have or grabbing power it did not deserve.That stubbornness would later bring him back into Trump’s orbit. After initially backing Ron DeSantis in the 2024 primaries, Massie eventually endorsed Trump, lured in part by Trump’s public promise to commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht, the imprisoned creator of the Silk Road marketplace.For Massie, who sees criminal-justice overreach and the drug war as core civil liberties questions, this was not just a favour to the base, it was a test of principle: if you are serious about reform, prove it on a case that actually offends the security establishment.To MAGA world, that reconciliation looked like a neat narrative arc. The rebel had been brought back into the fold. To Massie, it was something more transactional: he had not converted to Trumpism so much as found a specific, leverageable overlap between his libertarian priorities and Trump’s appetite for spectacle.Part of what makes Massie such an awkward fit in Trump’s Republican Party is that his weirdness pre-dates Trump.He is an engineer who treats politics like a badly designed machine. He sees institutions as systems with inputs and outputs, failure modes and unintended consequences. He is as likely to talk about load-bearing debt and feedback loops as he is to mention Ronald Reagan.Culturally, he is steeped in gun rights and rural identity. He pushes out family Christmas photos where everyone is holding a firearm, and he is an enthusiastic supporter of the Second Amendment. Ideologically, he is far closer to the old Ron Paul libertarians than to the television-friendly culture warriors who now dominate the House Republican conference. He hates surveillance programmes, opposes foreign interventions, and rants about the Federal Reserve.That combination makes him simultaneously a mascot and a migraine for leadership. He cannot be easily bribed with a subcommittee gavel and cannot be easily threatened by taking one away. His brand with his voters is precisely that he is willing to be the awkward “no” in a sea of party discipline.Which is why, when the Epstein story curved back into Washington in 2025, it was almost inevitable that Massie would end up at the centre of the storm.By late 2025, the Epstein saga was less a story and more a pressure cooker. Years after Jeffrey Epstein died in a jail cell, thousands of pages of material from his estate were slowly being prised open by courts and congressional committees. Newly released emails and records pulled in an ever growing cast of presidents, bankers, academics and celebrities.For Trump’s base, Epstein had become the symbol that held together half a decade of suspicion about “the elites.” If there was ever going to be proof that the global establishment operated by a different set of rules, it would be here, in the flight logs, correspondence and investigative files surrounding a convicted sex offender with a Rolodex that ran from Palm Beach to Buckingham Palace.The expectation was simple: if anyone was going to blow the whole thing open, it would be Trump. He had campaigned on draining the swamp, promised to take on the “deep state,” and spent years hinting that he knew things about Epstein and his friends that would shock the world.In office, the tune changed. Trump’s Justice Department did not throw open the files. His allies began warning that there were sensitive national-security considerations. What had been sold as a crusade for transparency began to look more like a negotiated truce among people who frequented the same elite social circles.Massie decided to test how serious anyone really was about full disclosure.He co-sponsored the Epstein Files Transparency Act, a bill that would require the Justice Department to make public virtually all files, communications and investigative materials related to Epstein and his long-time associate Ghislaine Maxwell within a fixed deadline. The bill allowed redactions to protect victims and ongoing investigations, but explicitly ruled out the usual bureaucratic escape hatches of “embarrassment” or “reputational harm” as reasons to keep things hidden.Under normal circumstances, such a bill would never see daylight. House leadership, sensitive to both Trump and the donor class, would simply keep it bottled up in committee. No messy floor debate, no awkward roll call.Massie and Democrat Ro Khanna decided to bypass that blockade. They reached for one of the dustiest tools in the House rulebook: the discharge petition. If you can persuade 218 members of the House to sign a petition demanding a vote on a bill that leadership has buried, you can drag it, kicking and screaming, onto the floor.For weeks, the petition crawled. Members liked the sound of transparency in theory, but they could see the minefield ahead. Signing meant risking the wrath of the White House, the Speaker, and whichever powerful people might find their names or emails in the files.The turning point came when a newly sworn-in Democrat from Arizona walked off the ceremonial platform, added her name, and took the tally to 218. At that moment, the mechanism locked. No one could withdraw their signature. The bill was now guaranteed a vote, no matter how loudly leadership complained.In the background, the pressure campaign went into overdrive. Republican signatories were leaned on by party leaders and White House officials. One was summoned to the Situation Room to hear about the supposed security implications of forcing disclosure.Massie did not blink.Publicly, Trump railed against what he portrayed as a partisan effort. Privately, he and his team urged Republican members to avoid the bill. For all his talk about Epstein and Democrats, he clearly did not want a law on the books that would yank open the government’s entire Epstein archive on a fixed timetable.Massie’s explanation for that gap was blunt. He has repeatedly said he does not believe the files contain a hidden smoking gun implicating Trump in Epstein’s crimes. He insists his effort is not about incriminating the president. What he does believe is that Trump is running cover for his own social world, for friends and donors in Palm Beach and New York who crossed paths with Epstein and would rather not see every email and calendar entry held up for inspection.In other words, the issue is not criminal liability, it is embarrassment.This is what makes Massie’s challenge so dangerous for Trump. He is not attacking from the centre, like Cheney, or from an institutional altar, like Romney. He is attacking from inside the original promise of Trumpism.If the whole point of sending Trump to Washington was to end the two-tiered justice system, then refusing to release the Epstein files looks less like strategic caution and more like outright betrayal. The people who most care about Epstein are the same people who still wear “drain the swamp” T-shirts to rallies. Telling them that the files must remain secret to protect unnamed interests is not going to land well.Massie has leaned into that contradiction. He points out that many Trump voters genuinely believed they were dispatching him to the capital to smash exactly this kind of elite omertà. Watching the White House try to kill a transparency bill on Epstein, he suggests, feels to them like discovering that the avenger in your favourite thriller has quietly joined the board of the villain’s company.The remarkable thing is that Massie has done all of this without doing the usual break-up ritual. He has not branded himself a “Never Trumper.” He has not gone on an endless cable-news tour. He still shares parts of Trump’s agenda, still cares about immigration, trade, and the culture war, still wants Ross Ulbricht freed.What he refuses to do is treat Trump as someone whose instincts automatically trump his own principles.In the short term, the Epstein Files Transparency Act remains a long shot. Even if it passes the House, it has to survive the Senate. Even if it clears both chambers, the president would be under enormous pressure to veto it. Yet, as with so many fights in Washington, the immediate legislative outcome is only part of the story. The other part is the signal it sends.Massie has just demonstrated that there is still a narrow procedural route to force uncomfortable issues onto the floor, even when both the Speaker and the President are opposed. He has shown that a Republican can survive the combined glare of leadership, the White House and the party media ecosystem, so long as he is willing to endure the noise and trusts his own voters more than the donor WhatsApp groups.He openly says that if he can get something done with the Speaker against him, the President against him, the Vice President against him and the FBI director against him, then he can use that same leverage on his older obsessions: cutting spending, shrinking the deficit, dragging the national debt back onto the agenda.In a party that has spent the past four years painstakingly teaching itself to forget what it said on 7 January 2021, Thomas Massie has chosen a different vocation. He is not particularly interested in rewriting the Trump chapter. He is interested in enforcing the terms that were written on the cover. If you promised to drain the swamp, he will hold you to that. If you swore there would be one law for everyone, he will send your allies a discharge petition and dare them to sign.In an age of very loud Republicans who ultimately fold at the hint of presidential disapproval, Massie has become something rarer and more unsettling: a quiet rebel who does his best work when the cameras are not looking, and who treats Donald Trump not as a king, but as one more politician to be brought to heel by the rules he once claimed to love.","Thomas Massie arrived in Congress in 2012 on the libertarian edge of the Tea Party wave.

'Painful': MBS on Khashoggi



Trump says Saudi crown prince 'incredible in terms of human rights'







US President Donald Trump snapped at a reporter in the Oval Office after being pressed on his family’s business interests and the Saudi Crown Prince’s alleged role in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, sharply retorting, “You don’t have to embarrass our guest. ”The exchange came as Trump rolled out one of the most lavish welcomes of his presidency for the de facto Saudi ruler, who is making his first trip to Washington since Khashoggi’s killing in 2018.The confrontation unfolded in the Oval Office after a reporter pressed Trump on whether it was “appropriate… for your family to be doing business in Saudi Arabia while you're President,” adding that “US Intelligence concluded that you orchestrated the brutal murder of a journalist,” in a question to the Crown Prince.The 47th POTUS immediately cut in, asking, “Now, who are you with?” When the journalist replied he was from ABC News, Trump shot back, “One of the worst. One of the worst in the business.”Trump then insisted he had stepped away from his private empire. “I have nothing to do with the family business… I’ve devoted 100% of my energy,” he said, adding that his family had “done very little with Saudi Arabia” and that anything they had pursued was “very good.”He went on to praise the Crown Prince directly. “He’s done a phenomenal job… He knew nothing about” the Khashoggi murder, Trump said. “You don’t have to embarrass our guests by asking a question like that.”MBS, however, opted to answer. “I feel painful about, you know, families of 911 in America,” he said, but argued critics were “helping Osama bin Laden's purpose of destroying this relation.”On Khashoggi, the Crown Prince said the killing was “painful,” a “huge mistake.""""It's really painful to hear, you know, anyone that been losing his life for, you know, no real purpose or not in a legal way. And it's been painful for us in Saudi Arabia,"" he said.""We've did all the right steps of investigation, et cetera, in Saudi Arabia. And we've improved our system to be sure that nothing happened like that. And it's painful, and it's a huge mistake, and we are doing our best that this doesn't happen again,"" he added.Trump also hailed Saudi Arabia's human rights record calling the Crown Prince's work 'incredible'. “I’m very proud of the job he’s done. What he’s accomplished is incredible — in human rights and in other areas,” Trump added.The flashpoint came on a day of extraordinary pageantry. Trump greeted the Crown Prince with a military flyover, cannon fire, a horse parade and celebrations on the South Lawn, presenting the visit as a reset after years of tension. “We appreciate it very much,” Trump said as he touted Saudi investment, insisting Riyadh would put “$600bn” into the US economy. “That number could go up a little bit higher… We have a lot of jobs. ”The red-carpet reception highlighted Trump’s determination to deepen ties with the Kingdom despite accusations from US intelligence that the Crown Prince approved the operation that killed Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. For MBS, the trip marks an attempt to re-establish himself on the global stage, as he pushes ahead with efforts to diversify the Saudi economy and build strategic partnerships in technology, defence and nuclear cooperation.Alongside meetings in the Oval Office and a gala dinner hosted by First Lady Melania Trump, the two governments are preparing to announce major defence and commercial agreements, including F-35 fighter jets and a “multi-billion dollar investment” in US AI infrastructure.","Trump says Saudi crown prince 'incredible in terms of human rights' 'Painful' killing of Jamal Khashoggi 'has been painful for us in Saudi Arabia', MBS says.

Epstein files: US House passes bill to declassify secret files; awaits Senate's nod,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/epstein-files-us-house-passes-bill-to-declassify-secret-files-awaits-senates-nod/articleshow/125421169.cms,"‘Emotional’ Epstein Survivor Bashes Trump Before Crucial House Vote | Watch





The US House on Tuesday passed a bill compelling the justice department to release the classified files linked to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The bill has now been sent to Senate.The bill passed 427-1, with the only no vote coming from Rep. Clay Higgins, a Louisiana Republican who is a fervent supporter of Trump. He also chairs a subcommittee that initiated a subpoena on the Justice Department for the Epstein files.This comes after President Donald Trump walked back months of opposition to opening a case file tied to one of the country's most notorious scandals.A separate investigation conducted by the House Oversight Committee has released thousands of pages of emails and other documents from Epstein's estate, showing his connections to global leaders, Wall Street powerbrokers, influential political figures and Trump himself. In the United Kingdom, King Charles III stripped his disgraced brother Prince Andrew of his remaining titles and evicted him from his royal residence after pressure to act over his relationship with Epstein.Pushing for more accountability, the survivors of Epstein's abuse cast the current effort in Congress as a step towards accountability for Epstein's crimes after years of government failure under multiple presidential administrations.Meanwhile, Donald Trump had urged Republican lawmakers to vote to release files, saying that he and his party have nothing to hide.While talking to reporters, Trump on Monday said that Epstein was connected to more Democrats and that he didn't want the Epstein files to “detract from the great success of the Republican Party.”Still, many in the Republican base have continued to demand the release of the files. Adding to that pressure, several survivors of Epstein's abuse rallied outside the Capitol Tuesday morning. Bundled in jackets against the November chill and holding photos of themselves as teenagers, they recounted their stories of abuse.Trump was close to Epstein and they were photographed together on several occasions.

Who is Jilani?

AHMEDABAD: Tension flared inside Sabarmati Central Jail on Tuesday when a terror accused, Syed Ahmed Mohiuddin Abdul Qader Jilani, 40, was assaulted by three fellow inmates.The attack occurred barely a day after Jilani, who is accused in the high-profile castor seeds ricin terror plot investigated by the Gujarat Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS), along with two others, was transferred to the Ahmedabad facility under judicial custody.Sources said the victim, a native of Hyderabad in Telangana, sustained facial injuries after being punched in the eyes and nose by Nilesh Sharma, an Amraiwadi resident who is lodged for a theft offence, and two others, who are still unidentified.Sharma, allegedly, attacked Jilani in an attempt to ""flaunt their patriotism"", a senior jail officer told TOI. Other inmates quickly intervened, stopping the assault and rescuing Jilani, who received treatment at the jail dispensary.This incident has immediately raised questions about security and possible complicity within the jail.""How did the three men pick Syed out of all the prisoners here? Were they guided or did someone from the jail inform them about Syed's alleged offence? We are looking into these issues,"" said a senior police officer, pointing to possible collusion or lapses in prisoner management.The city crime branch has launched an investigation into Sharma's to determine if the assault was premeditated or a spontaneous act.Following preliminary statements from other inmates confirming the role of the three men in the attack, the Ranip police registered an FIR. While Ranip inspector Ketan Vyas confirmed the lodging of the FIR, the victim, Jilani, reportedly failed to identify his attackers. DGP Prisons, K L N Rao, was unavailable for comment on the matter.Jilani and two accomplices were arrested by the Gujarat ATS last week for allegedly plotting terror attacks using ricin, a highly lethal toxin extracted from castor seeds. The trio was nabbed after months of surveillance and intelligence inputs, marking a significant breakthrough in anti-terror operations. Investigators said the accused allegedly procured castor seeds and were researching methods to extract ricin for use in targeted attacks.","Ricin plot accused attacked by 3 inmates at Sabarmati Centra Jail.

Umar doesn't stare into camera... doesn't want to make video look scripted, say psychologists

NEW DELHI: A chilling video of Delhi's car bomber Umar Un Nabi surfaced on Tuesday, attempting to justify suicide attacks by calling them as ""martyrdom operations"".Sources said the video was found in Umar's phone, which he had left back home in Pulwama.Umar's brother, who had earlier tried to dispose of the handset initially in a pond because of fear of getting involved, handed over the phone to agencies. The video was shot close to the day of the Delhi blast.Intelligence officials pointed out that this was a typical page from ISI's playbook to alleviate the dilemma faced by several recruits who consider suicide as forbidden. Notorious terror recruiter and Hafiz Saeed's aide, Abdul Rehman Makki, had even written a book on this topic.Dr Rajiv Mehta, senior consultant psychiatrist at Sir Ganga Ram hospital, said the man's manner of speech indicated he was brainwashed.Delhi bomber Umar, who drove the explosive-laden i20 that blew up near Delhi's Red Fort on Nov 10, is heard on video differentiating between fidayeen operations and suicide attacks. The terrorist is seen talking - appears to be explaining to someone on video - about how one of the very misunderstood concepts was the notion of what has been labelled as suicide bombing.""It's a martyrdom operation and it is...known in Islam,"" he said.Speaking in broken English but with an accent, Umar talked about ""dieing (sic) at a particular place..at a particular time"", corroborating a line of investigation that he was waiting to blow up the IED after Maghrib and Isha namaz in the evening.""There are multiple contraindications (sic).... There are multiple arguments that have been brought against it. Martyrdom operation is when a person presumes that he is going to surely die at a particular place, at a particular time...,"" he was heard saying in video.""He goes against the presumption that a particular person is going to die in a particular situation,"" he said.He went on to say that the core problem with suicide attacks is that when someone becomes convinced they will die at a particular time and particular place, they slip into a dangerous state of mind. They begin to believe that death is their only destination.""The biggest mistake people make is failing to understand what the idea of suicide bombing - truly is..,"" he added in the video.Psychologists agreed that the video sheds light on Umar's hardline jihadi ideology, shows that he was ready for a ""suicide attack"". He did not stare into the camera, talked while pretending to think - didn't want to make it look scripted, they noted.Dr Rajiv Mehta, senior consultant psychiatrist at Sir Ganga Ram hospital, said the individual's body language in the video suggested a high degree of confidence. The man appeared to be certain that he would be praised for what he was doing.He seemed to be attempting to inspire others by portraying his actions as necessary steps taken for a specific cause.","Video of Delhi's car bomber Umar Un Nabi surfaced on Tuesday.

Police sources said both of them are HIV positive. ""We are trying to find who else was in contact with them,"" a police officer said.Based on specific intelligence, police arrested the Syrian man, who is from Jableh on the Mediterranean coast. Investigators said he was carrying three Syrian passports but couldn't produce a valid visa. His student visa expired on March 14, 2020, while the visa renewed online was valid only until July 5, 2023.Inspector K K Gohil of Devbhumi Dwarka local crime branch said, ""He got admission to a private university in Rajkot through a govt of India scholarship in 2018 and arrived in 2019. He graduated in computer science.""Police said that after his visa lapsed, he tried to pursue a master's degree at Chittorgarh in Rajasthan, but was denied admission due to his incomplete documentation.Instead of returning to Syria to get a fresh visa, he moved to Khambhalia.According to officers, the Syrian man said he met the Khambhalia resident through a dating app while studying in Rajkot and developed a relationship. The Khambhalia man, who runs a school, later gave him accommodation. The Syrian man also helped with the school's clerical work. Officers said he produced a UNHCR refugee card during the check, which prompted further scrutiny.Superintendent of police Jayrajsinh Vala said, ""When his visa expired, he had no shelter. He developed a relationship with the Khambhalia man through a social media app. We will now begin an investigation and check his bank transactions and mobile records to learn more about his illegal stay.""Police sources said during the preliminary inquiry, the accused said he did not want to return to Syria because same-sex relationships are not accepted there, and because he had found a companion in India.The Syrian man was detained on Saturday and an entry was recorded at Khambhalia police station. After a joint interrogation by various agencies, a case was filed under Sections 14(A) and 14(C) of the Foreigners Act.

Cops question Prabhakar

BENGALURU: A 34-year-old software engineer, missing from Attibele since Oct 27, has been found buried inside a house in Kuppam, in Chittoor district of neighbouring Andhra Pradesh.The body was exhumed from a house on the outskirts of Kuppam on Nov 16.Police said the victim, Shrinath K, a software engineer and an Andhra native, was murdered by his cousin Prabhakar, 39.Police have arrested Prabhakar and his associate Jagadish, 35, both residents of Kuppam and known history-sheeters.Shrinath, along with his wife and child, lived in Smilee Celestial Layout of Neraluru village in Bengaluru.On Nov 1, Shrinath's wife Neha MP approached Attibele police and filed a missing person complaint, suspecting Prabhakar's role behind her husband's disappearance. Shrinath had apparently gone to meet Prabhakar at Kuppam on Oct 27, before he went missing, Neha told police.Investigation revealed that earlier, when Prabhakar met Shrinath at the latter's housewarming ceremony, he had suggested that Shrinath invest Rs 40 lakh in his business, promising to double the amount in return. Shrinath borrowed the amount and went ahead with the plan.Based on Neha's complaint, when police summoned Prabhakar, he claimed he had not met Shrinath and was unaware that he had gone to Kuppam.Prabhakar further claimed he was in Bengaluru meeting another relative the same day. He even produced some ""evidence"" in support of his claim. Subsequently, police let him go, ruling out his involvement in the crime.However, Neha kept insisting that Prabhakar must have had a major role in her husband's disappearance. She told police about Prabhakar's money-doubling offer, and that Shrinath had given him around Rs 40 lakh.Senior police officers directed the Attibele police inspector to launch an investigation based on Neha's claims, and the missing person case was turned into a case of kidnapping. On Nov 13, police arrested Prabhakar.During interrogation, when Prabhakar directly accused Neha of murdering Shrinath, police were convinced of foul play because until then, no one had raised a murder angle. More intense grilling followed, before Prabhakar cracked and confessed to killing Shrinath.He said he met Shrinath at a govt housing colony in Kuppam, killed him by smashing his head with a hammer, and then buried the body in one of the unoccupied buildings there with Jagadish's help.Prabhakar claimed Shrinath had given him only Rs 10 lakh, of which, he had returned Rs 5 lakh. But when Shrinath started pestering him to return the remaining amount, Prabhakar resolved to murder him.","Shrinath K, a software engineer and an Andhra native, was murdered by his cousin Prabhakar, 39.

"NIA cracks deeper layer of Red Fort suicide bombing: Jaish-e-Mohammed module was building mini-rockets, weaponised drones",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/inside-jaishs-hidden-arsenal-rockets-in-the-making-were-indian-cities-in-crosshairs/articleshow/125400127.cms,"NEW DELHI: Intensifying its probe into the November 10 Red Fort suicide bombing, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) has revealed that the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) module was actively developing small rockets for a series of planned blasts, in addition to plotting Hamas-style attacks using drones. The module’s sinister plans were foiled following multiple arrests and raids by the agency.On Monday, NIA arrested Jasir Bilal Wani, also known as Danish, a resident of Qazigund in Anantnag district, Jammu & Kashmir. Wani was identified as a key associate of suicide bomber Umar Un Nabi. He was taken into custody from Srinagar while the NIA team was conducting investigations in the Valley.According to officials, Wani had provided technical support for the terror attacks, including modifying drones and attempting to make rockets intended to trigger blasts at crowded locations.The drones were reportedly to be equipped with cameras, batteries, and small but powerful bombs, replicating attack patterns carried out by terror groups such as Hamas and ISIS in Syria, Iraq, Israel, and Afghanistan.The NIA is also probing a ‘shoe bomber’ angle in connection with the Red Fort blast. Investigators recovered a shoe from beneath the driving seat near the right front tyre of the i20 used in the attack.Forensic teams found a metallic substance inside the shoe and traces of TATP (triacetone triperoxide) on both the tyre and the shoe, which are now being examined to determine if it acted as a trigger mechanism. Explosive traces were also discovered beneath the car’s rear seat, suggesting multiple components may have been involved in the blast plan.Wani’s involvement as an ‘active co-conspirator’ came to light during the interrogation of previously arrested doctors linked to the module. The political science graduate revealed that he first met the doctor module last October at a mosque in Kulgam and had been asked by Umar to travel to Faridabad to participate in the terror plot.Earlier, the NIA had also arrested Amir Rashid Ali, a resident of Pampore, Jammu & Kashmir, in whose name the i20 car used in the attack was registered.A senior NIA officer stated, “Several teams are pursuing multiple leads and conducting searches across states to identify every person involved in the attack.

MEERUT: Two sub-inspectors in Bulandshahr were suspended after a 28-year-old gang-rape survivor alleged that the officers raped her for two days and extorted Rs 50,000 by claiming the money was needed to take action against her assaulters.The woman filed a complaint last week through the Integrated Grievance Redressal System (IGRS) portal, prompting senior police officers to order an inquiry into the conduct of the officers in the Khurja area, where she had earlier lodged her gang-rape complaint.Bulandshahr SSP Dinesh Kumar, told TOI that the woman had first approached police with a gang-rape complaint against four men, after which one accused was arrested.He said, ""The fresh allegations against the two officers were serious and both were suspended with immediate effect. The woman has changed her version multiple times and is now unwilling to file a formal complaint specifically naming the officers, which has made internal proceedings more complex although the suspension remains in force.""In her detailed submission, the woman said she was kidnapped in Nov last year by four men, drugged, and held captive for 48 days across Aligarh and other locations, during which she was raped repeatedly and forcibly converted.She said one of the accused had first contacted her on Instagram and later connected her with the other men involved.She added that after she managed to escape and reported the matter to the police, a sub-inspector allegedly summoned her to a private residence and raped her multiple times over two days, while another officer took Rs 50,000 from her after telling her the money was necessary to secure the arrest of the accused.She also alleged that her husband was detained at the police station and threatened with a false case to force her into complying with the officers' demands.She added she was recently attacked by two unidentified bike-borne men, though no FIR has been registered in that matter yet. She has also claimed that police delayed her initial FIR and that some of the accused, who she said were influential, threatened her family and attempted to silence her.Kumar said the investigation into the original gang-rape case established the involvement of only one accused, the man who had contacted her on Instagram.He said police verified the call detail records and mobile phone locations of the three other men she named and did not find evidence placing them at the locations she mentioned.

Al-Majd representative: 'Helping people to live'

Cooperation with Israel authorities

Times of Israel

Emigration a sensitive subject





It wasn't the first such flight out of Israel, but it was the first to get so much attention. Late last week, 153 Palestinians from Gaza arrived in South Africa on a charter flight from the Israeli airport of Ramon but they arrived without the correct documentation. Given how tightly Israel controls its borders — and those of the Palestinian territory that the passengers had to cross to make it to the Israeli airport — South African authorities couldn't work out how the plane had even managed to leave.Later on, it seemed to be because the Palestinians' travel had been arranged by an organization called Al-Majd Europe.On its website, the organization says it arranges ""humanitarian evacuation."" But activists have been raising concerns about flights organized by Al-Majd Europe since summer.Al-Majd claims it was founded in Germany in 2010 and is now located in Jerusalem. However no such company or charity exists in German registries and Israeli researchers say the same is true thereAl-Majd's website uses pictures of individuals from other crisis situations and claims them as its own. The website's IP address, and therefore its real location, is hidden by privacy software.The ""donate"" button on the website doesn't work and DW's own research shows Al-Majd has only ever received $106 worth of cryptocurrency via the Bitcoin account it lists — despite the fact it says it works with donations to assist the needy.The Palestinian passengers who traveled with Al-Majd to South Africa told journalists they paid between $1,500 (€1,200) and $2,000 (€1,720) but this was sent to personal accounts.This week, an investigation by Israeli newspaper,found more anomalies, including that Al-Majd is connected to Tomer Jamar Lind, an individual with dual Israeli-Estonian citizenship who's based in London.The air charter companies — Fly Yo,based in Romania, and Kibris Turkish Airline, based in Cyprus — that took the Palestinians to South Africa are both Israeli owned.Because of all of this, activists, South African politicians and media raised concerns that Al-Majd could well be part of a plan to transfer Palestinians out of Gaza.""The reports about people being flown to sometimes unknown destinations by Al-Majd are deeply troubling,"" says Tania Hary, executive director at Gisha, an Israeli non-profit advocating for Palestinian freedom of movement. ""It appears that this questionable private entity is taking advantage of people's desperation and beginning to quietly fulfil Israel's vision for transfer of Palestinians.""In February 2025 US President Donald Trump spoke about his ""Gaza Riviera"" plan, which would require moving locals out of Gaza to third countries. The same month, Al-Majd started advertising its services to Palestinians on social media. In March, the Israeli government announced it would create a ""directorate of voluntary emigration"" within its Ministry of Defense.Rights groups in Israel raised the alarm back then and say they still don't have much information about the directorate now. Hari says that a policy of ""voluntary emigration"" from Gaza is supported by senior Israeli politicians, and that Israeli intelligence agencies previously sent text messages to Gaza residents ""inviting them to explore departure options.""DW asked the Israeli Ministry of Defense about any connections to Al-Majd Europe but did not receive a reply by the time of publication Tuesday night.DW was able to contact a man named Omar, whose number is listed on Al-Majd's website. In an interview via WhatsApp, he said he was a Palestinian living in Jerusalem, but wouldn't give further details, including his last name, for security reasons.He told DW that speculation about Al-Majd's connections to the Israeli government is being spread by the militant Hamas group, which used to govern Gaza and is classified by multiple countries as a terrorist organization, and the Palestinian Authority, which governs the occupied Palestinian West Bank territory. He implied these two groups don't want people to leave Gaza.Omar also said that, in order to get people out of Gaza and to the airport in Israel, Al-Majd had to be in touch with Israel's Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, or COGAT, which runs Israel's official business in Gaza. COGAT is also part of Israel's defense ministry.""I'm helping my people in Gaza and this isn't emigration,"" Omar insisted. ""I'm helping people who want to live, not die inside Gaza.""But Omar refused to answer more challenging questions, for example about connections to Lind, how he got in touch with international, Israeli-owned charter companies and why the links on Al-Majd's website don't work. Nor would he explain Al-Majd's finances, and he said he ""couldn't remember"" how many Palestinians had left Gaza with Al Majd.So it remains unclear whether Al-Majd is connected to the Israeli government, whether it could be a private citizens' initiative in support of the government's policies, or whether it is simply a money-making venture.What is certain though is that Israeli security forces would have had to cooperate with the charter flights that left the country.Israel has restricted Palestinians' freedom of movement since 1967, when it occupied the Palestinian Territories. Those restrictions have evolved depending on the level of tensions between Israel and Palestinian militant groups. Before the current conflict, travel out of Gaza was allowed for work, for medical treatment or in ""exceptional humanitarian cases,"" such as the wedding or funeral of a first-degree relative.Today, with Israel's blockade of Gaza, since the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, it's even harder to leave the coastal enclave — although since the announcement of the directorate of voluntary emigration, Israeli media reports suggest it has become easier.There are no official numbers on how many Palestinians have left Gaza.The World Health Organization has organized 2,589 medical evacuations this year , with 5,000 companions. It's also thought that in early 2024 more than 100,000 Palestinains made their way to Egypt. But since then, as thereported in May this year, there haven't been as many departures.The issue of Palestinians leaving Gaza, even now, is politically fraught.""Under international law, every person has the right to live in their country in safety and dignity, to leave for their own security or any other reason, and to return to it,"" explains Omar Shakir, Israel and Palestine director at Human Rights Watch. ""The challenge in the Israeli-Palestinian context is that the Israeli government has a decades-long track record of blocking Palestinian refugees from their right to return home. ""In May, a survey by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research found that around half of Palestinians in the occupied territories would be willing to apply to emigrate. And beneath Al-Majd Europe's posts on TikTok, you'll see hundreds of comments from desperate Palestinians.""Under today's devastating conditions in Gaza, any such 'encouragement' cannot amount to free choice,"" argues Gisha director Hary. ""All the more so as Israel refuses to guarantee that people who leave will be allowed to return.

Melania’s Solo Glow-Up? Body Language Expert DECODES First Lady’s ‘Boosted’ Confidence Without Trump





Are ties between Donald Trump and Elon Musk warming again? The question resurfaced on Tuesday when tech billionaire Elon Musk appeared at the White House alongside the US President and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman -- their second public sighting together since a bitter feud earlier this year.Musk's presence signalled what many see as an effort at repairing a rocky relationship between the world’s richest man and the US president.The Tesla chief attended a candlelit dinner hosted by Trump for the visiting Saudi crown prince, just months after publicly calling for Trump’s impeachment and hinting that the president was linked to the scandal involving sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Before the fallout, Musk had been one of Trump's biggest backers. He funded Trump's presidential bid last year and later emerged as a key adviser, heading the Department of Government Efficiency and driving major cuts to federal spending and jobs.But the partnership quickly soured. Musk slammed Trump's sweeping tax-and-spending bill as irresponsible and said he intended to launch a new political party. Trump hit back, threatening to cut federal subsidies that support Musk’s companies.The feud -- combined with Musk’s increasingly hard-right political rhetoric -- dented Tesla’s brand image, sales, and stock performance, according to analysts.The two have rarely been seen together since. Their last public interaction was a brief handshake at a memorial event for conservative activist Charlie Kirk in September.Trump is hosting the Saudi crown prince as Riyadh works to rebuild its global image and strengthen ties with Washington. Also present at the high-profile dinner were Portugal football star Cristiano Ronaldo and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.",Elon Musk attended a candlelit dinner hosted by Donald Trump for the visiting Saudi crown prince.

A solid gold toilet — the satirical Maurizio Cattelan artwork once offered to US President Donald Trump — became the talk of the art world again on Tuesday when it sold for $12.1 million at Sotheby’s New York.The 18-karat, fully functional sculpture, titled America, weighs more than 220 pounds and opened bidding at $10 million. The auction took place during what Sotheby’s described as a “soft patch” for top-tier art sales, Forbes reported.Created by Italian conceptual artist Maurizio Cattelan, America has a history as striking as its materials. The work first drew widespread attention in 2016 when it was installed in a public bathroom at the Guggenheim Museum in New York, attracting nearly 100,000 visitors. The toilet also became a pop-culture curiosity when the Guggenheim, after the Trump White House requested a Van Gogh painting, offered the gold toilet instead, an overtly satirical counteroffer that went unanswered.Sotheby’s describes the piece as an “incisive commentary on the collision of artistic production and commodity value.” Cattelan himself has said the work mocks extreme wealth, noting: “Whether you eat a $200 lunch or a $2 hot dog, the results are the same, toilet-wise,” CNN reported.Another edition of the gold toilet was stolen in 2019 in a dramatic heist at Blenheim Palace, Winston Churchill’s birthplace. Thieves used sledgehammers to detach it from its plumbing. Although two men were eventually convicted, the sculpture was never recovered and is believed to have been melted down.Cattelan has previously said he created more than one edition of the piece.Tuesday’s auction also included major works from the late cosmetics billionaire Leonard Lauder’s collection. Gustav Klimt’s Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer sold for $236.3 million, while Blumenwiese and Waldabhang bei Unterach am Attersee fetched $86 million and $70.6 million respectively, according to Forbes.A day earlier, a Mark Rothko abstract from the collection of the late Weis Market chairman Robert F Weis and his wife Patricia sold for $62.1 million, bringing the total for that collection to $218 million.","The 18-karat, fully functional sculpture, titled America, weighs more than 220 pounds and opened bidding at $10 million.

This agreement aims to strengthen the Mahayuti alliance and prevent discord. While some Sena ministers were absent from a cabinet meet, citing local polls, others admitted to disgruntlement over BJP's recruitment tactics.

Ex-corporators shift was tipping point

MUMBAI: BJP will henceforth not take any Shiv Sena party worker and Sena will not take any BJP party worker, Dy CM Eknath Shinde said after meeting CM Devendra Fadnavis over functionaries from the two allies switching sides.The latest induction of three Sena ex-corporators, on Tuesday, was done by BJP state chief Ravindra Chavan, who is MLA from Dombivli. The ex-corporators were considered close to Shinde's son Shrikant, who is Lok Sabha MP from Kalyan.Sources said that when Shinde along with his cabinet colleagues met Fadnavis to discuss the issue after the cabinet meet, Fadnavis said it was the Sena which first started taking BJP workers into its fold. Sources said Shinde immediately stepped in to remind Fadnavis about how the poaching started. Sena leaders said trouble had started when BJP started poaching their workers first in Palghar and then in Kalyan-Dombivli and Ambernath. Finally, the Sena took BJP workers from Ulhasnagar, they said.Dy CM Shinde said after the meeting with the CM, ""We agreed both parties must maintain principles of an alliance and will follow a code of conduct.Henceforth, BJP will not take any Shiv Sena party worker and Sena will not take any BJP party worker.""He added, ""Office-bearers of both parties will not do anything that will lead to a discord. We want to make the Mahayuti strong. We are going in as an alliance, so leaders have to take care... We both agreed we would take responsibility for our respective parties.""Shinde further said, ""I have always said PM Modi is the leader of NDA and the Centre is also helping us. Our objective is to make Mahayuti strong. Our agenda is not of chair but of development."" On the likelihood of BJP going it alone in civic elections in the MMR except BMC, Shinde said, ""The CM has assured me that in most places, there will be an alliance and only where there is an aberration there will be a friendly fight.""BJP minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule called on Shinde in his office at Mantralaya to discuss the issue and later told the media there would be a coordination meet in the next two days.Sena minister Uday Samant denied there was any ""boycott"" of the cabinet meet and said ministers were away in their constituencies. ""I had gone for a health check-up, so I was not present. It was a coincidence that the other ministers were absent. Such coincidences will happen many times in the future... We have told the CM what was on our mind."" Bawankule too claimed ministers were in their areas due to local body polls.Dy CM Ajit Pawar, who heads NCP, was quoted by PTI as saying he did not sense any disgruntlement during the cabinet meet. Ajit Pawar said he was under the impression that the absence of Sena ministers was due to the scrutiny of nomination papers for the Dec 2 municipal council polls.""Makrand Patil from NCP was absent. Even our Hasan Mushrif left early. Had I had known about Shiv Sena ministers being upset, I would have asked Eknath Shinde about it. But I did not sense any disgruntlement,"" he said.Sena minister Pratap Sarnaik however admitted there was disgruntlement over inductions made by BJP.The Sena is miffed with Chavan, who has been welcoming workers into the BJP fold ever since he took over as state BJP president earlier this year. On his initiatives on inducting Sena workers, sources in Sena said, ""When Bawankule was state BJP president, there were no rifts in Mahayuti. Two ministers from each of the alliance partners met regularly to ensure coordination.""The sources described Ravindra Chavan as a ""pakshapravesh pradeshadhyaksha (party-entry state president).""In a post on X, Sena (UBT)'s Aaditya Thackeray claimed the Shinde-led party was upset as BJP was trying to split it, and there were issues regarding seat allocation for polls. ""But boycotting a cabinet meeting for their selfish interests is an insult to Maharashtra and its people!"" he stated.","Deputy CM Eknath Shinde announced BJP and Shiv Sena will cease inducting each other's workers.

Boost For Saudi Airpower; Trump Says U.S. Will Sell F-35 Aircraft To Riyadh Despite Israeli Concerns





US President Donald Trump on Tuesday announced that Saudi Arabia will be designated a major non-Nato ally as he hosted Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House.“Tonight, I'm pleased to announce that we're taking our military cooperation to even greater heights by formally designating Saudi Arabia as a major non-Nato ally, which is something that is very important to them,” he said. “And I'm just telling you now for the first time, because they wanted to keep a little secret for tonight,” news agency AFP quoted him saying.The move marks a significant elevation in defence ties between Washington and Riyadh and places Saudi Arabia among a select group of countries that enjoy privileged security cooperation with the United States.CBS News said the designation could pave the way for deeper joint military initiatives and greater interoperability between the two nations. It is also seen as a symbolic gesture underscoring closer strategic alignment, with US President Trump saying it would take “our military cooperation to even greater heights.”Saudi Arabia would join 20 other nations that currently hold major non-Nato ally status, including regional players such as Israel, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, Egypt, Tunisia and Jordan.This follows soon after US signed a sweeping set of agreements with Saudi Arabia covering civil nuclear cooperation, artificial intelligence and defence, including the long-anticipated sale of F-35 fighter jets on Tuesday.In a statement, the White House said both sides had signed a Joint Declaration on the Completion of Negotiations on Civil Nuclear Energy Cooperation, establishing the legal basis for a “decades-long, multi-billion-dollar partnership built on strong non-proliferation standards.” US had also approved a “major defence sale package” that includes future deliveries of advanced F-35 aircraft, despite long-standing Israeli concerns.

Bill that could imprison people who get abortions stalls; lawmakers split — what’s in it?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/bill-that-could-imprison-people-who-get-abortions-stalls-lawmakers-split-whats-in-it/articleshow/125424745.cms,"Screen grab (Source:X/@ABC)







A controversial South Carolina proposal seeking to impose severe criminal penalties on women who undergo abortions and potentially curtail the use of IUDs and in vitro fertilisation has stalled after failing to clear a key legislative subcommittee on Tuesday.Four of the six Republican members on the panel declined to vote, allowing the three Democrats to block the bill from advancing. The measure, which would prohibit all abortions except when a woman’s life is at risk, also carried some of the toughest punitive provisions seen in the US since the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade in 2022, reported news agency AP.Republican Senator Jeff Zell, explaining why he refused to vote, said he aimed to curb abortions but believed the bill went far beyond what most residents supported. “Say what you want. Play your politics. I’m not interested in that. What I’m interested in is speaking on behalf of South Carolinians and they’re not interested in this bill right now,” he said.Lawmakers had earlier rejected attempts to soften or remove provisions that would impose up to 30 years in prison on women seeking abortions and anyone assisting them. Efforts to strike language criminalising guidance on where an abortion could be legally obtained also failed.The bill’s wording suggested a ban on contraceptives that prevent implantation of a fertilised egg, raising concerns over IUDs and possibly constraining IVF procedures. Doctors warned that even offering information about out-of-state abortion services could be deemed illegal.Senator Richard Cash, the bill’s sponsor and a vocal anti-abortion figure, insisted the criminal penalties remained necessary. He argued that overturning Roe v. Wade had forced lawmakers to confront issues long overlooked. “We never even thought about it. And now we do,” he said.Anti-abortion groups themselves remain split. South Carolina Citizens for Life said it could not back the bill, arguing women are “victims too”. Equal Protection South Carolina took the opposite stance, with founder Mark Corral declaring, “Abortion is murder and should be treated as such.”Democratic Senator Brad Hutto welcomed the bill’s stalled progress but predicted the fight would resurface. “I say, if it’s January, there’s an abortion bill,” he remarked, signalling more legislative battles when the Assembly reconvenes in 2026.Advocacy groups such as WREN said the measure is “quite literally, the most extreme piece of legislation… ever in this country,” with CEO Amalia Luxardo warning it contains no exceptions of any kind and could have sweeping consequences for reproductive care.ABC news quoted Nimra Chowdhry of the Center for Reproductive Rights who cautioned that the bill could set a template for similar legislation in other conservative states, saying restrictive proposals often “gain momentum” once they advance.South Carolina currently enforces a six-week abortion ban, enacted in May 2023, with narrow exceptions for rape and incest up to 12 weeks, certain fatal fetal anomalies and when the pregnant person’s life is at risk.","Four of the six Republican members on the panel declined to vote, allowing the three Democrats to block the bill from advancing.

‘Desperate’ For Saudi-Israel Ties, Trump 'IGNORES' Pentagon's China Threat; Okays 48 F-35 Jets Deal





US President Donald Trump said on Monday that his administration would move ahead with the long-anticipated sale of F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia, despite internal concerns that the deal could expose sensitive American technology to China.When asked whether he would approve the sale, Trump said, “I will say that we will be doing that. We’ll be selling F-35s.”The announcement came a day before Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s expected arrival in Washington, his first US visit in over seven years. The F-35 deal is among several major agreements the two countries are likely to unveil during the visit, according to AP.The crown prince is expected to seek formal US assurances on military protection for the kingdom and the purchase of the F-35, one of the world’s most advanced fighter jets.The timing of the announcement also reflects Trump’s push to secure a normalisation deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel. He has promoted an expansion of the Abraham Accords as key to long-term regional stability while the fragile Gaza ceasefire holds. “I hope that Saudi Arabia will be going into the Abraham Accords very shortly,” he told reporters on Air Force One on Friday.However, Saudi Arabia has maintained that any deal must include a guaranteed pathway to a Palestinian state, a position Israel firmly rejects.Officials say Riyadh is unlikely to join the accords immediately, though there is guarded optimism about a possible agreement by the end of Trump’s second term.The New York Times reported that a Pentagon intelligence assessment raised fresh concerns that China could gain access to sensitive F-35 technology if the sale proceeds. Sources familiar with the Defence Intelligence Agency’s findings said US officials fear potential Chinese espionage and Beijing’s growing security cooperation with Riyadh. Washington has also been evaluating whether the sale would affect Israel’s qualitative military edge, given Israel is the only Middle Eastern country operating F-35s and has used them in strikes in Iran in October 2024 and June 2025.Bradley Bowman of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies said Congress may now seek clarity on what assurances Riyadh has offered regarding its ties with China.

Trump 'knew about the underage girls'?











Mark Epstein, the brother of the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein , has tried to shut down a viral rumour about the newly released Epstein emails. He said that the name “Bubba” mentioned in a 2018 exchange between the brothers was not a reference to former President Bill Clinton.The clarification came after a March 2018 email between Jeffrey and Mark Epstein was released this week by Democrats, which stirred a row. In the message, Mark asked Jeffrey, who had said he was with Steve Bannon, to “ask him if Putin has the photos of Trump b*****g Bubba.” Because Clinton was long known by the nickname “Bubba”, the reference was speculated by many as Trump having oral intercourse with Clinton.Mark Epstein pushed back in a statement to The Advocate, saying the message was being misread. “They were simply part of a humorous private exchange between two brothers and were never meant for public release or to be interpreted as serious remarks,” he wrote. He added, “For the avoidance of doubt, the reference to ‘Bubba’ in this correspondence is not, in any way, a reference to former President Bill Clinton.”Mark's spokesperson, Ali Clark, said in an email that Bubba is “a private individual who is not a public figure.”Mark said that attaching political motives to a nickname distracts from “the serious questions that remain unanswered.”The wider set of emails points to far more serious claims about Jeffrey Epstein’s political ties with the MAGA chief. In a 2019 message to author Michael Wolff, Epstein wrote that Trump “knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine to stop.” Another email from 2011, sent to Ghislaine Maxwell, claimed that Trump spent hours at Epstein’s home with one of his sex-trafficking victims.California Representative Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said the documents raise “serious new questions” about Trump’s ties to Epstein and accused the Justice Department of obstructing the inquiry. “There’s a massive cover-up at the White House and the DOJ right now over the files.”The White House has dismissed the emails, with press secretary Karoline Leavitt rejecting any suggestion of Trump being involved in the Epstein scandal.Meanwhile, Trump also claimed that Bill Clinton spent significant time on Epstein’s island and threatened to launch an FBI and DOJ probe into various high-profile figures, including JPMorgan and Chase.The row intensified on Friday when Trump launched a Truth Social rant attacking Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene after she backed a bipartisan move to force the release of all unclassified Epstein files.","Mark Epstein, the brother of the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, has tried to shut down a viral rumour about the newly released Epstein emails.

On Cam: Dem Lawmaker’s ‘Texts’ With Epstein Inside U.S. Cong Sparks Fury; Explosive Plaskett Link





Former Harvard University president and US treasury secretary Larry Summers has said he will step back from several public roles following the release of documents detailing years of personal correspondence with convicted sex offender and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.In a statement issued by him on Monday night, quoted by The Washington Post, Summers said he was “deeply ashamed” of maintaining contact with Epstein and accepted full responsibility for what he called a “misguided” decision. He said he would continue his teaching duties but would retreat from other commitments as part of an effort to rebuild trust and mend ties with people close to him.“I am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognize the pain they have caused,” Summers said. “I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr. Epstein. While continuing to fulfill my teaching obligations, I will be stepping back from public commitments as one part of my broader effort to rebuild trust and repair relationships with the people closest to me”, he added.His announcement comes in the wake of the House Oversight Committee’s release of a fresh set of documents detailing Epstein’s extensive interactions with political leaders, influential figures and long-time associates.While much public attention focused on Epstein’s comments about Donald Trump, the material also shed light on his communications with Summers.According to a report by The Guardian, emails exchanged between the two from 2013 to early 2019 show Epstein and Summers discussing politics, personal matters and Summers’s own relationships. In several of the exchanges, Epstein offered advice on Summers’s attempts to pursue a woman. The final messages were sent only months before Epstein’s arrest.The Centre for American Progress said Summers was no longer a fellow and confirmed that the planned launch of an economic working group he was to help lead had been put on hold as Summers continued to remain under public scrutiny. The Yale Budget Lab said he had withdrawn from its advisory group. Other organisations with which he is affiliated, including economic think tanks, did not immediately issue public comments.Summers, who served as Harvard University president from 2001 to 2006 and continues as a professor, faced renewed calls for the university to distance itself. Senator Elizabeth Warren, herself an emerita Harvard professor, told CNN that the institution should sever ties. Harvard did not respond to requests for comment.Epstein donated more than $9 million to Harvard and its affiliated programmes between 1998 and 2008 and briefly held a visiting fellowship that the university later found he was unqualified for.Summers has previously acknowledged regretting his dealings with Epstein.

Deposed Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina was Monday sentenced to death in absentia for the violent 2024 student crackdown by a special tribunal in a verdict that she described as a foregone conclusion. Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus hailed the verdict saying no one is above the law.Hasina had called the tribunal a kangaroo court and, as she told ToI before the verdict, one that was controlled by her political adversaries looking to deflect attention from their governance failures.India responded to Hasina’s sentencing with caution as it said in a statement that it had taken note of the verdict by the ""International Crimes Tribunal of Bangladesh” and, as a close neighbour, remained committed to the best interests of the people of Bangladesh, including in peace, democracy, inclusion and stability in that country.“We will always engage constructively with all stakeholders to that end,’’ said the external affairs ministry in a statement, giving nothing away on Dhaka’s renewal of its demand immediately after the sentencing for the extradition of the deposed PM who remains in India.The government has so far only acknowledged the interim government’s call for her extradition, while remaining non-committal on what it proposes to do about it.That has been its position since December last year, when Dhaka officially sought her extradition, and it’s unlikely to comply with any such request in haste now as Hasina’s dramatic death sentencing does little to change the situation on the ground as far as India is concerned.The 2013 extradition treaty with Dhaka in any case may provide immunity to Hasina from any political witch hunt. Article 6 of the treaty states that extradition can be refused if the offence for which it is requested is of a political character. While Dhaka will argue that the same article excludes murder from the list of such offences, Article 8 also states that a person may not be extradited if he can convince the requested state that the accusations against him were not made in good faith “in the interests of justice”.In short, extradition would be a complex and long-drawn-out process and, for India, entail both legal commitments and geopolitical considerations. The sentencing will likely only add another layer of complexity to Hasina’s case. As an aspiring great power, India would not like to be seen as giving up on a longtime ally who remained attuned to India’s economic and security interests, not least by keeping in check radical Islamists. Abandoning Hasina would also not just demoralise Hasina’s party Awami League, which is facing a ban from participating in the upcoming elections, but also energize radical anti-India forces.The unelected interim government has also done little to assuage India’s concerns about increasing radicalisation and safety and security of minority communities. India also knows that Dhaka’s ongoing efforts to revive the relationship with Pakistan can act as real conundrum for India soon, even as it engages the interim government by hosting the Bangladesh NSA for a security conclave this week.More than the fate of Hasina perhaps, India will be concerned about what the verdict might mean for Awami League as it seeks free, fair and inclusive polls in the country. Hasina told ToI last week that the ban came from an unelected cadre that seized power and now wanted to take its political opponents out of the game.“It was the Awami League that introduced key reforms to ensure transparency and fairness, including- the use of photo-based voter lists, see-through ballot boxes, and the establishment of an independent election commission. There is an irony that the only party which ensured free elections is now barred from participating,” she said. For India too, it’s imperative that Awami League be allowed to contest elections that are genuinely fair and inclusive.","Deposed Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina was Monday sentenced to death in absentia for the violent 2024 student crackdown.

EPSTEIN FILES: Ugly Clash In U.S. House; Mike Johnson Drops Truth Bomb On Dems | FULL





Donald Trump on Tuesday escalated his confrontations with women journalists, days after he called a Bloomberg reporter “piggy” when she questioned him about releasing files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The earlier exchange, which took place aboard Air Force One, resurfaced on social media on Tuesday and drew sharp criticism.The fresh controversy unfolded at the White House during Trump’s meeting with Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. ABC News correspondent Mary Bruce questioned Trump on potential conflicts of interest involving his family business and later asked the Saudi leader about the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Trump interrupted her, saying: “ABC fake news. One of the worst in the business.”Trump insisted he had “nothing to do” with the Trump Organization, now run by his two eldest sons. He also backed the crown prince’s denial of involvement in Khashoggi’s killing. “You don’t have to embarrass our guest by asking a question like that,” he told Bruce.Tensions rose further when Bruce raised the issue of Epstein after Congress voted overwhelmingly to release files linked to the disgraced financier, who died in 2019.Trump retorted: “It’s not the question that I mind. It’s your attitude. I think you are a terrible reporter.” He added he had “nothing to do” with Epstein and called the scandal a “hoax”, before telling her, “your crappy company is one of the perpetrators. ” He concluded the exchange by saying: “No more questions from you.” Trump also urged the US broadcast regulator to “look at” revoking ABC’s licence.The White House clash came to light just hours after the resurfaced Air Force One footage showed Bloomberg’s Catherine Lucey asking Trump why he would not release Epstein-related files “if there's nothing incriminating in the files.” Trump pointed at her and replied: “Quiet. Quiet, piggy.” CNN anchor Jake Tapper called the remark “disgusting and completely unacceptable.”The back-to-back incidents have renewed criticism of Trump’s treatment of journalists, especially women, as he faces renewed scrutiny over transparency and accountability.","Donald Trump escalated his confrontations with women journalists.

Engaging in terrorism

Not designated as terrorist organization by the federal government





Governor Greg Abbott designated the Muslim Brotherhood and the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim civil rights group, as ""foreign terrorist"" and ""transnational criminal"" organizations. The governor announced that this designation bans them from buying or acquiring land in Texas and also authroizes Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton to sue the organizations to shut them down.Abbott accused the Muslim Brotherhood of ""engaging in terrorism or attempting to destabilize countries"" and calls CAIR its ""successor organization."" The Muslim Brotherhood, founded in Egypt in 1928, is a transnational Islamist group with offshoots including Hamas.CAIR, founded in 1994, is the largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization in the U.S. It denies having any relations with the Muslim Brotherhood and states it has never been ""an affiliate, offshoot, chapter, or agent of any foreign movement, organization, political party or government.""Earlier, Abbott signed bill banning banning so-called Sharia compounds — targeting a development in North Texas — and tightening restrictions on land ownership by foreign or criminally affiliated entities.Neither Muslim Brotherhood nor CAIR has been designated as a terrorist organization by the federal government. Earlier this year, Sens. Ted Cruz and John Cornyn co-sponsored a bill that would require President Trump to designate the Muslim Brotherhood as a foreign terrorist organization. The bill claimed the organization was trying to undermine American allies in the Middle East but didn't elaborate on the organization's activities within the US. The bill hasn't advanced in the Senate.“Although we are flattered by Greg Abott’s obsession with our civil rights organization, his publicity stunt masquerading as a proclamation has no basis in fact or law,” CAIR stated. “By defaming a prominent American Muslim institution with debunked conspiracy theories and made-up quotes, Mr. Abbott has once again shown that his top priority is advancing anti-Muslim bigotry, not serving the people of Texas.”","Governor Greg Abbott designated the Muslim Brotherhood and the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim civil rights group, as ""foreign terrorist"" and ""transnational criminal"" organizations.

'No Talent In U.S.': Trump BURNS MAGA Base For India Reset? What It Means For Indian Workers





A video of long queues of wheelchair-bound people, visibly Indians, at some airport has triggered a massive social media controversy with Indians getting hate from all corners because of what social media users are calling ""new scam"". The viral post claimed Air India said 30% of passengers on India-US flights ask for wheelchairs and most of them are able-bodied travelers ""scamming the priority boarding system"" while those who really need a wheelchair don't get it.The same X account, claiming to be from Canada, posted another video of Indians ""taking all the wheelchairs at airports"". ""If they are doing this at airports, do you think our elderly are being scammed by them in our healthcare system too?"" the post read.""If they do that to board, imagine what theyll scam once theyre here,"" one wrote.Indian entrepreneur Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw reacted to the viral video and suggested that wheelchair at airport should come at a cost. ""They should charge an additional Rs 5000 per airport n then they will see how many genuine passengers there are!"" Shaw wrote.Shaw received flak for amplifying India-hatred on X and her suggestion was called inconvenient for people who are not faking their disability. Also, many users pointed out that there is no evidence to prove that they were all faking it. One user claimed that it is not about walking at the airport but the process because of which Indians get wheelchairs for their parents as they don't know English. ""It is not about walking it is about the process. Most indian parents don't know english and dont know where to go so their children book wheelchair so they can go to security clearance, terminal change and baggage collection area without tension,"" one wrote.","A video of long queues of wheelchair-bound people, visibly Indians, at some airport has triggered a massive social media controversy.
