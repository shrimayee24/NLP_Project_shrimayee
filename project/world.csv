A viral video showing a senior female professor and a first-year student performing a Hindu wedding ritual in the classroom has sparked outrage.The footage, which went viral, is from Maulana Abul Kalam Azad University of Technology (MAKAUT) in West Bengal. It showed the professor—dressed as a bride—and the student exchanging garlands and applying sindoor (vermilion), key customs of a traditional Hindu wedding.As the videos circulated on social media, outrage grew, with many questioning the appropriateness of such an act inside a university. According to PTI, the university administration quickly stepped in, forming a three-member inquiry panel to investigate the matter. Officials confirmed that the professor had been asked to go on leave until the probe was completed. The student involved has also been advised to stay away from classes for now.The professor, in her defence, told university authorities that the act was part of a psycho-drama demonstration for her class. She insisted there was no misconduct or immoral intent behind it. According to her, the videos were meant for internal documentation but were leaked to tarnish the reputation of the Psychology Department.PTI quoted MAKAUT’s officiating vice-chancellor Tapas Chakraborty acknowledging the professor’s explanation but said that, given the public reaction, the university had to take action. ""She has clarified that it was an academic project and not meant for external circulation,"" he said. ""However, since the videos have gone viral and created a controversy, we have asked her to proceed on leave until the committee submits its report.""The inquiry committee consists of three female faculty members from different departments.

In the early hours of Wednesday, as thousands of pilgrims gathered at Triveni Sangam in Prayagraj for a sacred bath, a surge of young men tore through the crowd, trampling sleeping devotees and those huddled near the ghat, recounted survivors and eyewitnesses. When the dust settled, 30 lay dead - most of them women.It began around 1am. Barricades gave way under the force of the crowd, and in the mad rush towards the river, those who had been waiting patiently for dawn were crushed underfoot, reports Arvind Chauhan. ""The crowd came like a tornado,"" said Maul Devi, a survivor from eastern UP. ""Most of them were young men running towards Sangam. There was no control, only mayhem. I fell twice with my sister, holding onto her hand as tightly as I could. But then the weight of the falling men broke us apart. She was crushed to death in front of my eyes."" Further down, people jostled and pushed each other for every inch after midnight. But a different warning had sparked panic.Police, perhaps fearing overcrowding, ordered pilgrims to take their dip immediately instead of waiting for dawn. ""Around midnight, we were resting a few hundred metres from Sangam. Suddenly, cops asked us to take a dip immediately,"" said Laxmi, who came from Chhatrapur in MP with her family. ""We were preparing when a wave of people came running towards us, and everyone was trampled. After that, police were missing. I lost my sister-in-law,"" she said.The bottleneck of movement only made things worse. Gudiya Pandey from Auraiya in UP described how a single open lane forced pilgrims into a narrow, choking space. ""I was pulled from a pile of bodies by some boys who helped me and others escape,"" she said.For some, the horror went beyond loss. A family from Maharashtra spoke of how their women were caught in the stampede. ""When my mother was rescued, her clothes were gone. She had just stepped out of the water when the crowd fell on her,"" a survivor said. Others, lucky to escape with their lives, abandoned their pilgrimage altogether.

A promising future broken by a risky tradition

A celebratory event for a Philadelphia Eagles fan turned into a catastrophic one. 18-year-old Tyler Sabapathy , like every enthusiastic Eagles fan, was present at 15th and Market Street, Center City, on Sunday to celebrate the Philadelphia Eagles' 55-23 win over the Washington Commanders and entry into the Super Bowl LI against the Kansas City Chiefs.Being an accomplished gymnast with over 120 medals, Tyler climbed up a pole to celebrate with more vigor, enthusiasm, and craze. Little did he know his celebration would cost him a heavy blunder.There were two more people with Tyler on the pole. Witnesses from the ground who captured the viral video of Tyler Sabapathy falling from the pole say, 'Tyler lost his grip and balance, fell backward from the pole, and hit his head on the concrete sidewalk.'Witnesses said police quickly came to his aid and took him to a hospital. Students of Temple University said Tyler sustained critical injuries to the brain over the weekend, and he succumbed to death Tuesday afternoon.The letter read:""The loss of a promising 18-year-old man like Tyler is both tragic and traumatic.

As an accomplished gymnast with more than 120 medals in provincial, regional and international competitions, Tyler was fascinated with injury prevention, and this ultimately led him to pursue the major that he did.

What is the divorce and Barack-Jennifer Aniston dating rumour?

Amid speculations over an impending divorce of Barack Obama and Michelle Obama triggered by Barack dating Hollywood actor Jennifer Aniston, a Vanity Fair report claimed that everything is false and the MAGA world is spreading all these rumors. Citing an anonymous person with knowledge of the situation, the report said that these ""rumors are categorically untrue"". ""And a course close to Aniston also characterized the affair rumors to VF as ""beyond absurd"","" the report said.The Vanity Fair report traced back the source of the salacious gossip to In Touch magazine which last year did a cover story on Obama and Jen to which Aniston reacted on the Jimmy Kimmel show. Calling the magazine a MAGAzine, the report tracked how the gossip was picked up and spread without any confirmation only through MAGA people.The report said Michelle Obama made it amply clear that she hates politics and hence her staying away from both Jimmy Carter's funeral and Donald Trump's inauguration was driven by her hatred towards politics and also Donald Trump -- not necessarily Barack Obama.Equating these speculations with those around Taylor Swift's rumored wedding, or Kate Middleton's health gossips, the reports said that everyone who lent a voice to the ongoing gossip is MAGA -- starting from Jessica Reed Kraus who wrote about it on Substack to Meghan McCain and then Megyn Kelly. They all repeated what others said only spreading the rumor without adding any input on their own and any value to it.The rumor is that Barack Obama and Michelle Obama do not live together and Michelle has checked out of DC life long back.

""We have her phone. It is locked,"" he told Reuters. ""We are probing all aspects, including honour killing.""According to the authorities, Anwarul-Haq had moved to the United States with his wife and children several years ago.However, on January 15, he returned to Pakistan with Hira, while his wife and two other daughters remained in the US Police confirmed that the murder was premeditated, with both men confessing to the crime.The case has now been transferred to the serious crime investigation wing for further inquiry.Meanwhile, TikTok remains unavailable on Apple and Google app stores in the United States.

Something needs to change,"" Musk posted on X.On April 19, Musk reiterated his stance, saying, ""In my opinion, TikTok should not be banned in the USA, even though such a ban may benefit the X platform.

US President Donald Trump has reportedly ordered a sweeping law enforcement crackdown on anti-semitism on college campuses, including the deportation of pro-Hamas activists on student visas.According to a report from Fox News, Trump's directive mandates that all federal agencies identify within 60 days the civil and criminal authorities available to combat anti-semitism, ensuring that any anti-Jewish activists who violate the law face prosecution or removal.""It shall be the policy of the United States to combat anti-semitism vigorously, using all available and appropriate legal tools, to prosecute, remove, or otherwise hold to account the perpetrators of unlawful anti-semitic harassment and violence,"" the order states.A White House fact sheet obtained by Fox News indicates that the department of justice will take immediate action to investigate and penalise anti-Jewish discrimination, particularly at what it describes as ""leftist, anti-American colleges and universities.""The announcement comes amid rising tensions on US campuses, where anti-Israel demonstrations intensified after the Oct 7, 2023, Hamas-led attacks on Israel. Recent Republican reports have accused the Biden administration of failing to address anti-semitism at these institutions and of withholding data on visa holders among anti-Israel protestors.In addition to the crackdown on campus anti-semitism, Trump has signed two education-related executive orders. One order will strip federal funding from K-12 schools that teach critical race theory or radical gender ideology, while another supports school choice initiatives.Trump also signed an executive order establishing the White House Task Force on Celebrating America’s 250th Anniversary. The group will plan the US semiquincentennial celebrations set for July 4, 2026.The executive order also reinstates a measure Trump originally signed in June 2020 to protect American monuments and memorials from vandalism and criminal violence. Citing recent incidents of pro-Hamas-related vandalism, the order references attacks on Washington, DC, landmarks, including the treasury department building and Lafayette Square, as well as the Columbus Memorial Fountain and Freedom Bell at Union Station.","US President Donald Trump has reportedly ordered a sweeping law enforcement crackdown on anti-semitism on college campuses.

Sanctuary city under scrutiny

A top Department of Justice (DOJ) official was in Chicago over the weekend as federal authorities carried out large-scale deportation raids, monitoring for any interference from city officials, reported The New York Post quoting a DOJ source.Acting deputy attorney general Emil Bove travelled to Chicago after warning that the DOJ could investigate and prosecute sanctuary city leaders who obstruct Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations.The crackdown resulted in 100 arrests in pre-dawn raids on Sunday, conducted by ICE alongside the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and other federal agencies.Chicago’s sanctuary policies prohibit local police from assisting federal immigration enforcement in most cases. According to The New York Post, ICE notified the Chicago police department of the general locations of its raids but withheld specifics.Bove recently launched the Sanctuary Cities Working Group, a DOJ initiative tasked with gathering evidence of potential federal law violations by sanctuary cities. The group is also investigating federal funding allocated to such jurisdictions.Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has remained defiant, vowing to uphold the city’s long-standing sanctuary status. “Regardless of who is in the White House, Chicago is a city that opens its arms to people from around the globe,” Johnson said Tuesday. He reaffirmed that the city would continue protecting immigrants under its “Welcoming City Ordinance.”Adding further, Johnson said, “The Welcoming City Ordinance is a law, and it is the law of the land here in Chicago. We will uphold it, along with the complementary Illinois Trust Act to ensure that our immigrant communities are safe”.The raids come amid heightened tensions between federal authorities and sanctuary city leaders. Tom Homan, former acting ICE director and Trump’s “border czar,” criticised Chicago for what he described as a “well-educated” illegal migrant population.“They’ve been educated on how to defy ICE, how to hide from ICE,” Homan said in an interview with CNN, adding that aid organizations provide pamphlets guiding migrants on how to avoid arrest. “They call it ‘Know Your Rights.’ I call it ‘how to escape arrest,’” he said.As per The New York Post, the House Oversight Committee is also investigating Johnson and other mayors for implementing policies that allegedly obstruct ICE operations.","Acting deputy attorney general Emil Bove travelled to Chicago after warning that the DOJ could investigate and prosecute sanctuary city leaders.

It was often a perverse scene of despair and violence.”She praised Kennedy Jr . for “pulling himself out of illness and disease” but lamented the “siblings and cousins who Bobby encouraged down the path of substance abuse suffered addiction, illness, and death while Bobby has gone on to misrepresent, lie, and cheat his way through life.”“I have never wanted to speak publicly about my family members and their challenges,” she wrote.Robert F.

The Trump administration struggled to clarify which programmes would be affected by the spending pause.Sources speaking anonymously about internal communications confirmed that the OMB cancelled the order through a brief two-sentence notification to government agencies and departments on Wednesday.Officials in the administration explained that the temporary suspension of loans and grants was intended to verify compliance with Trump's recent executive orders. Agencies were required to respond to specific yes-no questions about each federal programme by February 7, including queries about gender ideology promotion and abortion support.The unclear language in the memorandum, coupled with incomplete White House clarifications throughout the day, left government officials, legislators and citizens uncertain about which programmes would face funding interruptions. Even brief funding disruptions could potentially result in job losses or delays in public service delivery.The implementation of the freeze, originally set for 5 pm Tuesday, was temporarily halted by a federal judge until at least Monday, following an emergency session requested by grant-receiving nonprofit organisations. A separate legal challenge from Democratic state attorneys general remained unresolved.Officials from the Trump administration confirmed that direct assistance programmes, including Medicare , Social Security, student loans and food stamps, would continue uninterrupted. However, they faced difficulties in providing precise details.Initially, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was uncertain about Medicaid's exemption status, though the administration later confirmed its exclusion from the freeze.The impact of Trump's funding pause initiative extended beyond Washington, despite his campaign promises.

According to Jackson, Melania should have worn a blazer or blouse in the official photo -- but she said it was better than her 2017 photo.“Trump looked more like she was guest starring on an episode of ‘The Apprentice’ than assuming the role of first lady of the United States,” she wrote, referring to the black Dolce & Gabbana tuxedo jacket, white button-up and Ralph Lauren cummerbund Melania wore for the photo taken by Belgian photographer Régine Mahaux.“The choice to wear a tuxedo — as opposed to a blazer or blouse — made Trump look more like a freelance magician than a public servant.”The writer said Melania perhaps refused to ""abandon theatrics"" for the portrait since she lived in a ""gold-encrusted penthouse"" and her fame is ""so intertwined with a reality-television empire"".“This time, while the portrait remains more subdued, the Trumps are displaying wealth not through diamond rings but through the coterie of tech CEOs who sat in the front row at the 2025 inauguration, whose combined net worth was over a trillion dollars.”The black and white photo of Melania drew flak as many social media users called it ""heavily photoshopped"" but Vogue's harsh criticism of Melania has a context. Vogue did not make a cover on Melania during her first stint as the First Lady ditching a long-running tradition which they again reversed for Jill Biden as Jill was featured on Vogue cover months before the election.Melania Trump had earlier reacted to Vogue's snub to her not featuring her on the cover. “They’re biased and they have likes and dislikes, and it’s so obvious,” she had said. “And I think American people and everyone sees it. It was their decision, and I have much more important things to do—and I did in the White House—than being on the cover of Vogue.”On Vogue's X post, users called the magazine petty. ""She’s stunning and rarely misses when it comes to fashion…your opinions are trash and based purely on politics. Pathetic,"" one wrote. One shared the photo of writer Hannah Jackson and asked whether she should be giving out fashion advice to anyone.

Ramaswamy reacts to Selena Gomez's sobbing over deportation: 'It didn't strike me as real'



Days after announcing his exit from the Department of Government Efficiency and before he announces formally his Ohio Governor election run, Vivek Ramaswamy finds himself at different interviews talking about everything including his controversial exit from DOGE and whether he was fired by Elon Musk.The latest has been Vivek Ramaswamy's chat with popular streamer Adin Ross where he was asked about his pronouns. ""I go by they/him,"" Adin Ross said. With a laugh, Vivek Ramaswamy said, ""My pronouns are win/win"". And then he also said there are two genders: male and female.A poll by a pro-Ramaswamy outside group has revealed that Ramaswamy is over 50 per cent among Republican primary voters and leads his nearest competitor by 34 points. The poll by Fabrizio, Lee & Associates ""makes it clear that Vivek is the unquestioned favorite to not only win this primary, but to dominate it,"" Axios reported citing a source. ""Since news about his run began leaking, there's been an avalanche of interest from donors wanting to raise money for his run, and big-name political figures offering to endorse,"" it said.Ramaswamy has now given several interviews clarifying that there was no clash between him and Elon Musk and DOGE turned into more of a tech product and hence Elon Musk is the best person to handle it.

Secret recordings reveal that RFK Jr cheated 'because he was being abused at home',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/secret-recordings-reveals-that-rfk-jr-cheated-because-he-was-being-abused-at-home/articleshow/117699073.cms,"New York Post

Robert F Kennedy Jr reportedly told his wife Mary Richardson Kennedy that it was her own fault he’d cheated on her with dozens of women, according to an American magazine citing secret recordings he made of their conversations during their bitter divorce.“I want to be in a monogamous relationship. I don’t want to be in a polygamous relationship. I think that’s wrong,” he told her in a June 2011 recording accessed by Mother Jones magazine.“But then why have you done it for 10 years?” asked Richardson, who had found a diary listing 37 of her husband’s infidelities.“I did it because I was being abused at home,” Kennedy replied.It was just one of more than 60 conversations that President Donald Trump’s nominee for secretary of health and human services secretly recorded, according to Mother Jones. At least one recording appeared to have been made when Kennedy was in California, a state that requires both parties to consent to a recording, the site reported.He apparently used the recordings to compile a 60-page affidavit accusing Richardson of violent outbursts, excessive drinking, physical abuse, and threatening suicide in front of their children.Richardson in turn prepared a previously unreported point-by-point rebuttal, saying Kennedy “has been stealthily tape-recording phone conversations in my home,” according to Mother Jones. She died by suicide in May 2012, without ever filing the rebuttal in court.In the document, Richardson admitted she had once lost her temper and hit Kennedy, but she denied many of his allegations—including that she had ever talked about killing herself in front of their kids. Her husband was waging a “scorched earth” campaign against her, she said.She also alleged Kennedy had physically abused her, was abusing prescription medicine, had lied to her about the extent of his infidelity, and was a bad father. She also called him a “sexual deviant” and a sex addict, and said she had texts and photos from his phone related to his affairs.“I have witnessed Bobby’s obsessive-compulsive need to not only beat but annihilate someone he perceives as an adversary. He re-jiggers the facts, or makes them up, and rushes to tell as many people as he can so that is the version of reality that gets distributed in people’s minds—classic gaslighting,” she wrote.In September 2013, Kennedy’s 2001 “sex diary” was leaked to the. In the back of a nearly 400-page red notebook, he listed 37 women and, using a scale of 1 to 10, noted which sex acts they’d done.Sixteen of the women were marked as 10s; on one day he recorded a “triple play” with three separate encounters listed as 10, 3 and 2.The diary highlights Kennedy’s struggles with his “lust demons,” and on days he’d managed to resist a sexual temptation, he wrote, “Victory.”“Despite the terrible things happening in the world, my life is… great. So I’ve been looking for ways to screw it up. I’m like Adam and live in Eden, and I can have everything but the fruit. But the fruit is all I want,” he wrote in November 2001. In an earlier entry he wrote, “It’s not ­misogyny. It’s the opposite! I love them too much.”","Robert F Kennedy Jr. secretly recorded his wife, Mary Richardson Kennedy, according to Mother Jones magazine.

LONDON: Baloch leader Hyrbyair Marri brought attention to the ongoing horrors that the Pashtun and Baloch communities endure under Pakistan 's repressive control in a stirring statement to the Pashtun National Council (Jirga). Marri brought attention to the Pakiststate's systematic exploitation, enforced disappearances, and violence against various ethnic communities.""The sufferings of the Baloch and Pashtun under Pakistan's occupation are countless and unending,"" Marri stated, emphasizing the urgent need for unity between the two nations to resist colonial oppression.He recalled previous instances of solidarity, such as the treaty of kalat in 1758, in which Afghan and Baloch leaders promised to respect and support one another. He asked both groups to rekindle this spirit in their struggle for independence.Marri compared British imperialism to the colonial strategies that Pakistan acquired. He denounced Pakistan's continuous military actions in Balochistan , pointing to unlawful executions, torture, and enforced disappearances as means of quelling dissent. The Baloch leader cited the targeted profiling of Pashtuns and killings like the 1948 Barbra event in Charsadda, claiming that these practices were continuations of the British heritage of divide and conquer.Recalling how Pashtun tribes were utilized as frontline combatants in 1948 while Punjabi elites remained behind, he also denounced Pakistan's abuse of Baloch and Pashtun youth. He also drew attention to the fact that thousands of Baloch youths were forcibly drafted into the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s and sent to die under pretences of religious salvation.Marri condemned Pakistan's racial profiling of Afghan refugees, primarily Pashtuns, and their forced deportation as a pressure tactic against Afghanistan. ""These people have lived here for generations, yet they are treated as disposable,"" he said.Calling for a renewed alliance between the Baloch and Pashtun nations, Marri declared, ""Our unity is the path to freedom.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan criminalised online disinformation on Tuesday, passing legislation that enshrines punishments of up to three years in prison, a decision journalists say is designed to crack down on dissent.The law targets anyone who ""intentionally disseminates"" information online that they have ""reason to believe to be false or fake and likely to cause or create a sense of fear, panic or disorder or unrest"".The law was rushed through the national assembly with little warning last week before being approved by the senate on Tuesday as journalists walked out of the gallery in protest.Senior journalist Asif Bashir Chaudhry, a member of the Pakistan federal union of journalists , told AFP the government had assured reporters they would be consulted but said they were ""betrayed and backstabbed"".""We genuinely wanted a law against misinformation, but if it's not being done through open discussion but rather through fear and coercion, we will challenge it on every available platform,"" Chaudhry said.""Even under dictatorships, legislation was not forcefully rammed through parliament the way this government is doing now.""The bill will now be passed to the president to be rubber-stamped.Analysts say the government is struggling with legitimacy after an election plagued with rigging allegations and with Pakistan's most popular politician, former prime minister Imran Khan , in jail on a slew of corruption charges his party says are politically motivated.Khan's supporters and senior leaders have also faced a severe crackdown, with thousands rounded up.Social media site X has been shut down in the wake of elections last February, as posts alleging vote tampering spread on the platform.Khan's name is censored from television and editors have reported increasing monitoring of their programming.Senator Syed Shibli Faraz, a member of Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, called the new law ""highly undemocratic"" and said it would ""fuel the political victimisation"" of their activists.However, government minister Tanveer Hussain said that the bill would focus on policing social media.""I am sure that in the future, the anarchy caused in society through social media will be controlled,"" he said.There has been a proliferation of ""disinformation"" laws, including criminal legislation, worldwide in the past decade enabling governments to control speech online and police ""fake news"", according to human rights organisation Article 19 .Such laws can impede journalism, according to the group, which promotes freedom of expression and information globally.","Law targets anyone who ""intentionally disseminates"" information online that they have ""reason to believe to be false or fake"" Law rushed through national assembly with little warning before being approved by the senate.

He sentenced the four men to death and also fined them 4.6 million Pakistani rupees (approximately $16,000). They were identified as Rana Usman, Ashfaque Ali, Salman Sajjad, and Wajid Ali.According to the court order, dated Jan 24, the four individuals were sentenced to death by hanging for using derogatory remarks against the Holy Prophet. They were also sentenced to life in prison for defiling the Holy Quran and to 10 years’ imprisonment for deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs. “All the sentences shall run concurrently,” the order read.The prosecution lawyer said the case was supported by forensic evidence from the devices used. The men’s lawyer, Manzoor Rahmani, criticised the court’s order, saying doubts and uncertainties that arise in such cases are ignored by the courts, likely due to fear of a religious backlash and potential mob violence against the judge if the accused is acquitted.“We are preparing our appeals against the decision and will go to the high court,” Rahmani said. A member of a support group formed by the families of the accused was quoted by media as saying the pattern of arrests and prosecutions in this case was consistent with previous ones.“We urge the government to establish a commission to investigate the rise in these cases before these young individuals spend the best years of their lives behind bars,” said the support group member.Critics say blasphemy accusations, whether true or false, often lead to lengthy prison sentences on death row and solitary confinement. The laws, according to them, are often abused to settle scores or used to target members of Pakistan’s religious minorities.Hundreds of people have been accused of blasphemy since the draconian laws were introduced by former dictator Gen Zia-ul-Haq in the 1980s.

A Pakistani court on Monday awarded death penalty to four men for ""online blasphemy"" against the Prophet Mohammed and the Islamic holy book Quran.The four were charged with spreading blasphemous content online against Prophet Mohammed and the Islamic holy book.""They were sentenced to death... on Friday for spreading blasphemous content online against the Prophet Mohammed and the Quran,"" Rao Abdur Raheem, a lawyer from the legal commission on blasphemy Pakistan, a private group which brought the case to court, told news agency AFP.""Our case was supported by forensic evidence from the devices used in this heinous act,"" he added.The four men were sentenced in Rawalpindi, the garrison city that neighbours the capital Islamabad.A member of a support group formed by the families, however, said to AFP that they would challenge the conviction.""The pattern of arrests and prosecutions in this case is consistent with previous ones,"" said the support group member, who spoke on condition of anonymity told the news agency.""We urge the government to establish a commission to investigate the rise in these cases before these young individuals spend the best years of their lives behind bars,"" the member added.Blasphemy laws in Pakistan are among the strictest in the world, carrying severe punishments, including the death penalty, for offences against Islam.These laws, primarily enshrined in Sections 295-298 of the Pakistan Penal Code, criminalise acts such as insulting the Prophet Muhammad, desecrating the Quran, or offending religious sentiments.These laws have often been criticised for being misused to target minorities, settle personal disputes, and incite mob violence. The lack of safeguards against false accusations has led to numerous cases where individuals face imprisonment, violence, or even extrajudicial killings without substantial evidence.The blasphemy laws have sparked national and international debates about human rights and freedom of expression in Pakistan.Activists argue that these laws suppress religious minorities, limit free speech, and create a climate of fear, while conservative groups strongly defend them as essential to protecting Islam.High-profile cases, such as those of Asia Bibi and Salman Taseer, have highlighted the deep divisions in Pakistani society regarding these laws. Successive governments have been reluctant to amend or repeal the legislation due to the risk of backlash from religious hardliners. As a result, blasphemy remains a highly sensitive issue, with calls for legal reforms often met with strong resistance.","Pakistani court awards death penalty to four men for ""online blasphemy"" against the Prophet Mohammed and the Islamic holy book Quran.
