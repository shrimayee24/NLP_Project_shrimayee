In a remark that could provide fresh ammunition to the opposition, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis's wife Amruta Fadnavis on Wednesday said Hindi should be taught in schools, as it helps connect with people across the country.Her statement came three days after the BJP-led government withdrew a government resolution (GR) which introduced Hindi as a third language from Classes 1 to 5.""Marathi is number one (language) for Maharashtra, no doubt about it. To communicate at the global level, English is useful. But for connecting with people across the country, from North to South and East to West, I personally feel Hindi could be included in the curriculum,"" Amruta Fadnavis told reporters here.Students should have the freedom to choose from available language options, she said, adding, ""It will help in promoting inclusivity. Students should get options to learn (languages) and they can choose,"" she added.The Fadnavis government had initially announced in April that Hindi would be introduced as a third language from Class 1, triggering criticism from opposition parties who accused the BJP of trying to `impose' Hindi at the cost of Marathi.The government then said it was putting the decision on hold, but a fresh GR clarified that Hindi could still be taught as an optional third language.The move drew even stronger backlash, and opposition parties and groups such as the Marathi Abhyas Kendra mounted pressure on the government, forcing it to withdraw the two GRs and announce the formation of a committee to review the policy.",Amruta Fadnavis said Hindi should be taught in schools as it helps connect with people across the country.

Jaishankar Reveals US Role in India-Pak Ceasefire During Op Sindoor, Debunks Trump Trade Deal Claim

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Wednesday called out the West for not backing New Delhi's stance on terror, and reiterated that the ceasefire between India and Pakistan was negotiated between the DGMOs of the two countries.At a press conference in Washington DC, Jaishankar said there are often countries that do not take a position when some other countries are victims of terrorism.""It is a fact that often countries do not take a position when some other countries are victims of terrorism, which they would do when they themselves are. In that respect honestly, we have been much more consistent and principled. When terror attacks happen elsewhere outside India, we have largely followed the same position that we have taken when they have happened in India,"" said the EAM.He further said that countries are not backing each other ""sufficiently enough"" and part of diplomacy is to ""exhort them, encourage them, persuade them, motivate them to do that, and which is why it's important to speak up, and which is why it's important to carry them with us to the best possibility"".Asked about the recent ceasefire between India & Pakistan after the Operation Sindoor and role of the US in mediation, the EAM said: ""The record of what happened at that time was very clear and the ceasefire was something which was negotiated between the DGMOs of the two countries...""he said, refuting US President Donald Trump's repeated claim that he brokered the ceasefire between India and Pakistan.Jaishankar, who is in the US for 3-day trip for the Quad foreign ministers meeting, had also met Indian-origin FBI Director Kash Patel ,US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard.They held a discuss on various topics ranging from cooperation between India and the US in countering organised crime, drug trafficking and terrorism to the global situation and bilateral cooperation.",S Jaishankar said there are often countries that do not take a position when some other countries are victims of terrorism.

Buddhists from across world wrote to Dalai over continuation of institution

KULLU: Ahead of his 90th birthday, the Dalai Lama on Wednesday said the institution of the Dalai Lama would continue, and that Gaden Phodrang Trust, founded by him, has the sole authority to recognise the future reincarnation.In a message to China, which has been insisting that it would choose the successor, the 14th Dalai Lama said ""no one else has any such authority to interfere in this matter"".""When the time comes, His Holiness will reincarnate, and any adult or a person from any gender can be recognised as his reincarnation,"" said Samdhong Rinpoche, a member of the Trust, at a press conference in McLeodganj. ""It's not necessary that the next Dalai Lama will be from Tibet,"" Rinpoche said.A PTI report from Beijing quoted the Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman rejecting this succession plan. At a media briefing, Mao Ning insisted any future heir to the Dalai Lama ""must follow the principles of domestic (Chinese) recognition - the 'Golden Urn' process - and approval by the central govt (Beijing) in line with Chinese religious traditions and laws"".In a recorded video statement shown on Wednesday, the first day of the three-day 15th Tibetan Religious Conference that started in McLeodganj, the 14th Dalai Lama said responsibility for choosing his successor rests exclusively with the members of the Gaden Phodrang Trust, a non-profit foundation established by him in 2015.Gaden Phodrang members should carry out the search for his successor in accordance with tradition, he said.""They (the members) should consult the various heads of Tibetan Buddhist traditions and the reliable oath-bound Dharma Protectors who are linked inseparably to the lineage of the Dalai Lamas. The members should carry out the procedures of search and recognition in accordance with past tradition,"" said the Dalai Lama.The Dalai Lama recalled that he had asked, during a meeting with the heads of Tibetan spiritual traditions on Sept 24, 2011, whether the institution of the Dalai Lama should continue, and mentioned then that as far back as 1969 he had made it clear that the ""people concerned should decide whether the Dalai Lama's reincarnations should continue in the future"".""I also said during the meeting in 2011 that when I am about 90, I will consult the high lamas of the Tibetan Buddhist traditions, Tibetan public, and other concerned people who follow Tibetan Buddhism, to re-evaluate whether the institution of the Dalai Lama should continue,"" he said.The Dalai Lama also said that he has had no public discussions on this issue in the last 14 years. However, members of the Tibetan parliament-in-exile, members of the Central Tibetan Administration, NGOs, Buddhists from the Himalayan region, Mongolia, Buddhist republics of the Russian Federation, and Buddhists in Asia, including from mainland China, have written to him with reasons, earnestly requesting that the institution of the Dalai Lama should continue.""In accordance with all these requests, I am affirming that the institution of the Dalai Lama will continue,"" said the Dalai Lama.Trust member Rinpoche said there wouldn't be any other message from the Dalai Lama regarding his successor in the coming days. ""Whatever instructions he will give now will be meant for the Gaden Phodrang Trust only.""It's not necessary that the Dalai Lama's reincarnation would be from Tibet only, he remarked. ""There are no restrictions or limitations of geographical boundaries when it comes to the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama. In the past, the Dalai Lamas have taken birth in different countries,"" he said.In response to a question on the future of the Tibetan freedom movement, Penpa Tsering, head of the Tibetan govt-in-exile, said Tibetans would continue to follow the ""middle way policy"". ""It was proposed by the Dalai Lama and approved by a majority of Tibetans in 1996, and unanimously adopted by the Tibetan govt-in-exile. This policy cannot be changed by one person and will continue in future as well. There will have to be a referendum to change our policy,"" said Tsering.","The 14th Dalai Lama says responsibility for choosing his successor rests exclusively with the members of the Gaden Phodrang Trust.

He even offered her the post of the college union's general secretary - supposedly his ""final bait"" - before planning the alleged assault inside the campus security guard's room on June 25 with law students Zaib and Pramit.""Zaib and Pramit said that at least two days before the crime, Monojit informed them that the survivor would be on campus to submit an exam form.

He and Zaib also called several college seniors, some with political links, pleading for help.

""He had been roaming free despite police filing chargesheets in each of the 11 FIRs filed against him since 2013 and was confident he would get away this time as well,"" a source said.Investigators said Monojit allegedly also intended to abuse his target a second time a few days after the crime by blackmailing her with a video of the sexual assault on campus, which Zaib and Pramit recorded on a mobile phone. ""We urge other women who may have faced similar harassment and molestation to step forward and lodge complaints,"" a police officer said.All 17 students who were on campus on June 25 are being questioned as part of the probe into what might be a larger conspiracy behind the gang rape.","Co-accused Zaib Ahmed and Pramit Mukherjee say prime suspect Monojit Mishra would obsess over the survivor in conversations with his inner circle.

A convoy of 310 vehicles carried the devotees toward the sacred Amarnath cave shrine in south Kashmir.“Undeterred by recent terrorist activities, devotees of Lord Shiva are arriving in huge numbers, demonstrating their immense faith,” said Sinha. “I hope this year’s yatra will be even more historic than previous years.”The pilgrimage, running from July 3 to Aug 9, is taking place amid heightened security following the April 22 terrorist attack in Pahalgam that killed 26, mostly tourists.

BENGALURU: Swapnil Nagesh Mali, the 30-year-old senior associate consultant at Infosys who was arrested, and later released on bail, for secretly filming one of his female colleagues inside their office washroom, has confessed to the police that he had secretly recorded at least one more woman in the company restroom.During interrogation, Swapnil said he derived ""satisfaction"" from watching such videos and had more than 50 such downloaded clips on his phone.Swapnil, a BE from Ram Nagar in Maharashtra's Sangli district, is the son of a farmer. Police said his parents were shocked and deeply disturbed when informed about his arrest.According to the victim's complaint, around 11 am on June 30, she went to the washroom. While using the toilet, she noticed a reflection on the cubicle door and saw someone attempting to pull something from the adjacent stall.She quickly stepped out and saw another woman exiting one of the other cubicles. To verify what exactly was the matter, she returned to the same stall that she had been to, climbed onto the commode and saw a man standing on the commode in the neighbouring cubicle and recording her. His trousers were off.As soon as she confronted him, the accused began apologising repeatedly. The victim then ran out and alerted her colleagues about the intruder in the women's washroom. Swapnil, who was trying to flee, was cornered and caught by housekeeping staff.According to the police, the victim and another female employee from the company's HR department checked Swapnil's phone, and found the victim's video clip in it. They took a screenshot of the clip as evidence and deleted it from the accused's phone to make sure it wasn't shared.However, according to a senior police officer, the videos were still on the phone as those had not been deleted permanently. ""Once we confirmed that the videos were still thereon his phone, a woman police sub-inspector was told to check those,"" the officer said.""After informing her company HR, the victim returned home and informed her husband about the incident, who advised her to file a police complaint so that legal action could be initiated,"" police said.Subsequently, the victim lodged a police complaint on July 1.When Electronics City police produced the accused in court, the magistrate noted that the sections invoked are punishable with less than seven years' imprisonment and directed police to follow proper arrest procedures and grant station bail.The magistrate also reminded the cops that even minor lapses could lead to the accused being acquitted.","Swapnil Nagesh Mali, 30, a senior associate consultant at Infosys, was arrested for secretly filming one of his female colleagues inside their office washroom.

In response to the unjust and unilateral decisions taken by some officials—forcing private unaided schools to admit RTE 12.1.c applicants without due verification, harassing school administration with show cause notices, and threatening to cancel recognition—all private unaided schools in the state will remain closed on Thursday, July 3, expressing our resentment, with a request to the govt to kindly address the concerns and safeguard our rights.

ST PAUL: The man charged with killing former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, and wounding a state senator and his wife, is due back in federal court Thursday for a hearing that was put on hold after his lawyer said his client had been unable to sleep while on suicide watch.The hearing is expected to address whether Vance Boelter should remain in custody without bail and affirm that there is probable cause to proceed with the case. He's not expected to enter a plea. Prosecutors need to secure a grand jury indictment first, before his arraignment, which is when a plea is normally entered.An unshaven Boelter, 57, of Green Isle, was wearing a green padded suicide prevention suit and orange slippers when he was brought into court last Friday. Federal defender Manny Atwal then asked Magistrate Judge Douglas Micko to continue the hearing. She said Boelter had been sleep deprived due to harsh conditions in the Sherburne County Jail, making it difficult for them to communicate.""Your honour, I haven't really slept in about 12 to 14 days,"" Boelter told the judge then. And he denied being suicidal. ""I've never been suicidal and I am not suicidal now.""Sherburne County Sheriff Joel Brott, whose jail houses both county and federal prisoners, rejected Boelter's claims of poor conditions as absurd.""He is not in a hotel. He's in jail, where a person belongs when they commit the heinous crimes he is accused of committing,"" Brott said in a statement Friday.Boelter faces separate cases in federal and state court on charges of murder and attempted murder for what the state's chief federal prosecutor, Acting U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson, has called ""a political assassination"" and ""a chilling attack on our democracy."" The feds are going first.Authorities say Hortman and her husband, Mark, were shot to death in their home in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Park in the early hours of June 14 by a man disguised as a police officer who was driving a fake squad car.Boelter also allegedly shot and seriously wounded state Sen John Hoffman, and his wife, Yvette, earlier that morning at their home in nearby Champlin. The Hoffmans are recovering, but Hortman's golden retriever, Gilbert, was seriously injured and had to be euthanized.Boelter surrendered near his home the night of June 15 after what authorities called the largest search in Minnesota history, a hunt of around 40 hours.Atwal told the court last week that Boelter had been kept in what's known as a ""Gumby suit,"" without undergarments, ever since his first court appearance June 16. She said the lights were on in his area 24 hours a day, doors slammed frequently, the inmate in the next cell would spread feces on the walls, and the smell would drift to Boelter's cell.The attorney said transferring him to segregation instead, and giving him a normal jail uniform, would let him get some sleep, restore some dignity, and let him communicate better. The judge granted the delay.Boelter's lawyers have declined to comment on the charges themselves, which could carry the federal death penalty. Thompson has said no decision has been made whether to seek it. Minnesota abolished its death penalty in 1911. But Attorney General Pam Bondi has said from the start that the Trump administration will be more aggressive in seeking capital punishment.Prosecutors allege Boelter also stopped at the homes of two other Democratic lawmakers. They also say he listed dozens of other Democrats as potential targets, including officials in other states. Friends described Boelter as an evangelical Christian with politically conservative views. But prosecutors have declined so far to speculate on a motive.Former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris joined the mourners at the Hortmans' funeral last Saturday. Gov Tim Walz, Harris's running mate on the 2024 Democratic presidential ticket, eulogized Hortman as ""the most consequential speaker in Minnesota history.""Hortman served as speaker from 2019 until January. She then yielded the post to a Republican in a power-sharing deal after the House became tied in the 2024 elections, and became speaker emerita.",Vance Boelter is due back in federal court Thursday for a hearing that was put on hold after his lawyer said his client had been unable to sleep. The hearing is expected to address whether he should remain in custody without bail and affirm that there is probable cause to proceed with the case. He's not expected to enter a plea.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122218397,imgsize-976797,width-400,resizemode-4/122218397.jpg"
2 constables attached with Mira Bhayandar Vasai Virar arrested for abetting suicide of Nalasopara builder,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thane/2-constables-with-mbvv-arrested-for-abetting-suicide-of-nalasopara-builder/articleshow/122218179.cms,"



VASAI: Two constables attached with the Mira Bhayandar Vasai Virar (MBVV) commissionerate were arrested by the Achole cops (Nalasopara) on Wednesday early morning under charges of abetment of suicide and criminal intimidation.They were sent to five days of police remand after they were produced in the Vasai court on Wednesday afternoon. They were allegedly pressuring a Nalasopara developer to vacate a project he was working on, in which the cops had financed him.In the FIR, daughter of the deceased, mentioned that her father, Jayprakash Chauhan who was a developer by profession, was developing a property Om Shree Ji Cooperative Housing Society since 2015 in Nalasopara east and had constructed six floors and the work was not going ahead due to funds crunch. Hence, Chauhan took finance from these two cops in January of around four to five lakhs and then in April of around 20 - 25 lakhs. She claimed that the finance taken was around 33 lakhs from these constables Rajesh Mahajan and Shyam Shinde.In the second week of June, while having food with the family Chauhan mentioned that Mahajan and Shinde were pressuring him and had threatened him to leave the project as they have already decided who will continue this project and he was tensed.Again after a week he revealed that these cops had threatened him to book him in a false case and apply a series of BNS sections which will force him to rot in the jail. He also mentioned that these two cops were promised a couple of flats against their finance of 33 lakhs but now wanted the whole project. Post this, Chauhan switched off his cell phone due to fear and left his home and started living at a different flat.It was on the night of June 30 around 9:30 that things went out of hand when a broker, Lala Lajpat, who is the third accused in this case, reached his house, threatened him, and told him to leave the project.Next day when he wasn't reachable , the family went to the flat he was staying, and found him hanging from the ceiling. He was taken to the hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival.This is when the family went to take Chauhans Aadhaar card from his car, that they found his suicide note mentioning names of Mahajan and Shyam Shinde. The Achole cops didn't wait for a moment and first filed an accidental death report (ADR) on Tuesday late night and then filed the FIR at 5 in the morning and arrested both the cops by taking them into custody.

In May, India received 1.96 million barrels of oil per day from Russia. This change in import strategy led to Russian oil rising from under 1 per cent to about 40–44 per cent of India’s total crude imports in a short span.","Jaishankar expressed ""concerns"" over the US threat to impose a 500 per cent tariff on countries buying products from Russia.

Trump's immigration crackdown: DOJ memo outlines plans for 'prioritizing denaturalization’; Who will face denaturalization in the US ?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-immigration-crackdown-doj-memo-outlines-plans-for-prioritizing-denaturalization-who-will-face-denaturalizationintheus/articleshow/122196341.cms,"What is denaturalization?

Is ‘good moral character’ a condition for retaining US citizenship?

Who can be denaturalized?





A memo issued by the US Department of Justice(DOJ) has directed federal attorneys to actively pursue denaturalization cases, aligning with the Trump administration's immigration enforcement objectives.The memo dated June 11 instructed DOJ’s civil division to “prioritize and maximally pursue denaturalization proceedings in all cases permitted by law and supported by the evidence” to ""advance the Administration's policy objectives"".The concept of naturalization typically concerns the grant of citizenship to a person who has lived in the United States for a specified time period and meets certain other requirements. So the concept of denaturalization refers to the revocation of citizenship from a naturalized US citizen.In the United States, when an individual is denaturalized, they revert to their prior status before obtaining citizenship. For instance, if someone was once a permanent resident, they will be regarded as such again, potentially leading to deportation actions.The memo states that US attorneys were given significant authority to begin actions against naturalized citizens, especially those considered to have a deficiency in ""good moral character.""Officials were required to prove that an individual did not possess ""good moral character,"" a term that is broadly interpreted and not clearly defined.The recent memo outlines various categories of individuals who may have their naturalized citizenship revoked, offering clearer criteria for determining who is deemed lacking in ""moral character."" This includes individuals connected to terrorism, espionage, war criminals, and those who have been found to have provided false information during their naturalization process.While attorneys are urged to prioritize cases involving individuals who ""pose a potential danger to national security,"" the memo also states that they can seek out ""any other cases referred to the Civil Division that the Division determines to be sufficiently important to pursue.""Denaturalization is among the DOJ’s top five enforcement priorities for the civil division, which also lists “Combatting Discriminatory Practices and Policies,” “Ending Antisemitism,” “Protecting Women and Children,” and “Ending Sanctuary Jurisdictions”.","A memo issued by the US Department of Justice has directed federal attorneys to actively pursue denaturalization cases.

Recall of probe report 'abnormal'







The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) blocked probe into the allegations of Chinese Communist Party meddling into the 2020 US presidential elections to benefit Joe Biden , aiming to shield then-FBI Director Christopher Wray as it would ""contradict"" his congressional testimony, Fox News Digital reported citing newly declassified FBI documents.The documents, containing exchanges between FBI officials prior to the 2020 election, were recently declassified by FBI director Kash Patel and sent to senate judiciary committee chair Chuck Grassley of Iowa.According to the report, Chinese government created “a large amount” of fake US driver’s licenses, generated using data from millions of TikTok users, “tens of thousands of Chinese students and immigrants sympathetic to the Chinese Communist Party to vote for US Presidential Candidate Joe Biden, despite not being eligible to vote in the United States,” the New York Post reported.Moreover, the FBI’s Albany field office reported the plot from a credible source, but FBI headquarters ""suppressed"" the report, partly because it would ""contradict"" director Wray’s congressional testimony claiming no coordinated national voter fraud.Internal communications showed Albany staff protested the suppression, warning that political motives were influencing intelligence handling and that the suppression prevented other agencies from vetting the information.Details of the alleged meddling were shared in an FBI Intelligence Information Report (IIR) on September 25, 2020, just a day after Wray told Congress the bureau had no knowledge of any “coordinated national voter fraud effort”. The report, however, was withdrawn within minutes of being released.Calling the move ""abnormal"", FBI assistant director Marshall Yates, in a letter to Chuck Grassley earlier this year said, “Based on conversations with key individuals involved, it was conveyed that the recall of the IIR was abnormal.”Yates had said that the probe report had ""prompted significant attention throughout FBI Headquarters"" and ""the recall was issued to 'reinterview' the source.""""The rationale provided to Albany staff for the recall was that Headquarters deemed the report not 'authoritative,' but this characterization was met with disagreement by those in the Albany office. Internal emails reflect that Albany staff had concerns that suppressing the IIR would be 'dangerous if we cite potential political implications as reasons for not putting out our information,' emphasizing that it was not the role of analysts to align intelligence with public testimony,"" he wrote in the letter.","Recall of probe report 'abnormal' says FBI assistant director Marshall Yates.

Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska made a critical call on Tuesday, casting a vote for President Donald Trump’s massive tax-and-spending bill.For much of the all‑night session, Senate Minority Whip John Thune was uncertain whether he could secure Murkowski’s support. The Alaska senator spent hours in public and private discussions, pressing colleagues to soften provisions she said would burden her state’s most vulnerable residents.Murkowski at the end provided the 50th Republican “yea”, paving the way for Vice‑President JD Vance to break the tie and pass the measure 51‑50.Three Republicans—Susan Collins of Maine, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Rand Paul of Kentucky—joined all Democrats in opposing the bill.“I advocated for my state’s interests, and I will make no excuses for doing that,” Murkowski told reporters just after the vote. “Do I like this bill? No. But I tried to take care of Alaska’s interests.”Her support was unsure after the Senate parliamentarian struck down two attempts to boost Medicaid payments for Alaska and Hawaii, ruling they violated reconciliation rules. A further bid to increase Alaska’s Medicaid funding was also rejected early Tuesday, dealing another blow to Thune’s efforts.“I held my head up and made sure that the people of Trump’s ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ could cost thousands of lives, say University researchersAlaska are not forgotten in this,” Murkowski said. “I think there is more that needs to be done, and I’m not done.

Diddy trial verdict: Rapper convicted on prostitution charges; cleared on sex trafficking counts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/diddy-trial-verdict-hip-hop-mogul-cleared-of-sex-trafficking-charges-guilty-of-soliciting-prostitution-full-judgement/articleshow/122208725.cms,"Court Turns Circus Before Diddy Verdict: Half-Naked Woman Sparks Outrage

Disturbing allegations, mixed outcome

Inside the case: What Diddy was accused of





In a mixed verdict, the court found Sean ""Diddy"" Combs not guilty of racketeering conspiracy and not guilty of sex trafficking allegations involving both Cassie Ventura and a woman referred to as ""Jane. "" However, he was found guilty of transporting Ventura, Jane, and others across state lines for the purpose of prostitution. The outcome reflects a partial conviction, clearing him of the most severe trafficking charges while holding him accountable for facilitating illegal transport.The verdict, delivered by a Manhattan jury after three days of deliberations, means the 55-year-old hip-hop mogul avoids a life sentence but still faces the possibility of up to 10 years in prison. He was found guilty of violating the federal Mann Act by transporting individuals — including ex-girlfriends and paid male sex workers — across state lines for prostitution.Combs showed visible relief as the jury returned its decision. He smiled, nodded, and clasped his hands together in a prayer-like gesture towards the jury, before hugging his lead defence lawyer, Teny Geragos. Moments later, he thanked the panel of eight men and four women, who had earlier struggled to reach consensus on the most serious racketeering charge.The acquittal on the racketeering and sex trafficking charges — both of which could have resulted in life imprisonment — marks a significant legal victory for Combs. But the felony conviction under the Mann Act still puts his freedom and career in serious jeopardy.Prosecutors had painted Combs as the architect of a two-decade criminal enterprise, using his fame, wealth and staff to intimidate, coerce and control his victims. Central to the case were accusations from singer Cassie Ventura and another woman known only as ""Jane"", both of whom alleged years of psychological and sexual abuse.The women testified that Combs forced them into drug-fuelled sex marathons involving hired male sex workers — events referred to in court as “freak-offs.” Jurors heard disturbing claims of beatings, blackmail, and threats of revenge porn. One hotel assault caught on camera showed Combs dragging and kicking Ventura — footage that circulated widely.At the heart of the federal trial were disturbing allegations that Combs used his wealth, power and influence to force women into sexually abusive situations. Prosecutors accused him of orchestrating drug-fuelled sex marathons involving male sex workers, using blackmail, violence and coercion to maintain control over victims.Central to the case was testimony from R&B singer Cassie Ventura, Combs’ former long-term partner, and another woman known only as Jane. Both described being trapped in abusive relationships where they were allegedly threatened, assaulted, and pressured into performing sexual acts at Combs’ direction.Prosecutors argued that Combs operated like a mob boss, using a network of employees, bodyguards and assistants to commit or cover up crimes including bribery, arson, kidnapping and witness tampering. They pursued the racketeering charge under the federal RICO statute — a legal tool historically used to dismantle organised crime.Combs’ legal team rejected the charges as an overreach, describing the trial as an attempt to criminalise his consensual sexual lifestyle. They acknowledged elements of domestic violence but insisted there was no basis for federal sex trafficking charges.","The verdict means the 55-year-old hip-hop mogul avoids a life sentence but still faces the possibility of up to 10 years in prison.

Sean ""Diddy"" Combs was denied bail on Wednesday after a jury convicted him of federal prostitution charges, though he was acquitted of more serious allegations involving sex trafficking and racketeering.Judge Arun Subramanian ruled that Combs would remain in custody while awaiting sentencing on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. Each count carries a potential sentence of up to 10 years in prison.Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo urged the judge to release Combs before sentencing, stating, “He’s not going to flee. He’s been given his life back.” But Judge Subramanian refused to reconsider, pointing to the seriousness of the evidence presented during the trial.“For present purposes, the defendant is unable to meet his burden” to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he does not pose a threat to any person or the community, the judge said. He also highlighted that “at trial, the defense conceded the defendant’s violence in his personal relationships,” adding that the evidence showed Combs had a “yearslong pattern of violence.”Prosecutor Maurene Comey argued against bail, stating, “The only thing that’s exceptional about Combs is his wealth, his violence and his brazenness” and “his continued criminality and his willingness to violate the law.”Agnifilo pushed back with a pointed remark: “Listening to Ms. Comey makes me appreciate that we have juries.”Combs, 55, was found guilty of two prostitution-related offenses that carry a maximum sentence of 10 years each. However, the jury acquitted him of sex trafficking and racketeering charges that could have led to a life sentence. He has been in custody since his arrest in September.","Sean ""Diddy"" Combs was convicted of federal prostitution charges. He was acquitted of more serious allegations involving sex trafficking and racketeering. Judge Arun Subramanian ruled that Combs would remain in custody while awaiting sentencing.

‘Malfeasance’: Donald Trump’s housing chief urges Congress to probe Fed’s Jerome Powell; cites 'deceptive' testimony,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/malfeasance-donald-trumps-housing-chief-urges-congress-to-probe-feds-jerome-powell-cites-deceptive-testimony/articleshow/122213900.cms,"Jerome Powell (AP)





US President Donald Trump's top housing regulator is intensifying his clash with federal reserve chair Jerome Powell, urging Congress to launch an investigation into the central bank leader.Federal housing finance agency director Bill Pulte, who has voiced growing concerns that high borrowing rates are harming the housing market, urged lawmakers on Wednesday to investigate Powell for alleged “political bias” and for his recent Senate testimony regarding renovations at the Fed’s headquarters.Pulte accused Powell of lying to Congress last week about the condition of the nearly 100-year-old building, which Powell described as requiring “serious renovation.”“This is nothing short of malfeasance and warrants ‘for cause’ removal,” Pulte said in the statement posted on X. “Chairman Powell must be investigated by Congress immediately.”Pulte’s criticism mirrors that of President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly attacked Fed Chair, recently dubbing him “too late” for not cutting interest rates sooner. Earlier this week, Trump sent Powell a handwritten note claiming, “you have cost the USA a fortune, and continue to do so,” pointing out that US interest rates are still higher than those in many other major economies.The attack over the Fed building renovations marks a new angle in the administration’s criticism of Powell. During a hearing, senate banking chair Tim Scott questioned the Fed chief about the project, referencing a New York Post article that likened the renovations to the “Palace of Versailles.”","US President Donald Trump's top housing regulator is intensifying his clash with federal reserve chair Jerome Powell.

University of Idaho stabbings: Bryan Kohberger pleads guilty to murdering four college students; families divided over plea deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/university-of-idaho-stabbings-bryan-kohberger-pleads-guilty-to-murdering-four-college-students-families-divided-over-plea-deal/articleshow/122213191.cms,"Bryan Kohberger (AP)





A 30-year-old man accused of fatally stabbing four Idaho college students in 2022 pleaded guilty on Wednesday as part of a plea deal to avoid the death penalty, admitting to the quadruple murder in the small college town.Bryan Kohberger, a PhD criminology student, had been scheduled to stand trial in August for the brutal killings that shocked the US.At a courtroom in Boise, Idaho, he pleaded guilty to all charges, accepted four consecutive life sentences, and waived his right to appeal. During the hearing, Judge Steven Hippler detailed the terms of the plea deal and chose not to reject the agreement, despite it being a source of division among the victims’ families.Kohberger remained motionless and showed no emotion as the court read the victims’ names. The judge asked him whether he had carried out the murders “willfully, unlawfully, deliberately, with premeditation and malice aforethought.”He responded, “yes”.Judge Hippler said he will formally be sentenced on 23 July.The plea agreement guarantees that Kohberger will not face trial, originally scheduled for August, and removes the possibility of a death sentence for the murders of Madison Mogen, 21; Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Ethan Chapin, 20.The gruesome nature of the killings, the young age of the victims, and the suspect’s criminology background drew widespread public attention to the case.The four University of Idaho students were discovered fatally stabbed in their off-campus rental home on November 13, 2022. Kohberger, who was studying criminal justice at a nearby university at the time, was arrested weeks later in Pennsylvania, where his family resides.The plea agreement has caused division among the victims’ families.Outside the courtroom, Kaylee Goncalves’ father, Steve, said he felt “pretty let down,” adding that the state “made a deal with the devil,” according to newsagency Reuters.His family had hoped for a full confession, including information about where the murder weapon was hidden and confirmation that the defendant acted alone. The family claimed that prosecutors rushed into the plea deal without consulting the victims' families.""After more than two years, this is how it concludes with a secretive deal and a hurried effort to close the case without any input from the victims’ families on the plea’s details,"" the family said.However, Madison Mogen's father, Ben, told CBS that he felt relieved by the outcome and welcomed the deal because it enables his family to move forward with their lives and avoid a trial that would require revisiting the entire case in detail.“We can actually put this behind us and not have these future dates and future things ... that have to do with this terrible person,” he said. “We get to just think about the rest of lives and have to try and figure out how to do it without Maddie and the rest of the kids,” he added.Kohberger, a student at nearby Washington State University, was charged in January 2023. Until now, he had maintained his innocence, and prosecutors have not disclosed a motive. It is believed that he did not know the victims personally.","Bryan Kohberger, 30, pleads guilty to killing four University of Idaho students in 2022.
