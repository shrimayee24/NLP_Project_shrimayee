Poll Do you think India should focus more on high-tech solutions for national security today? Yes, technology is key for modern defense No, traditional strategies still matter

Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar: Lieutenant General Vinod G Khandare (retired), who was the principal advisor to the Ministry of Defence during Operation Sindoor , on Sunday said further escalating the recent Indo-Pak conflict by occupying the PoK would have given birth to a ""new monster' for India.""The ceasefire was announced by India after a request from Pakistan DGMO. The war is not a cheap solution, as it comes with heavy expenditure and creates a financial burden. We have to decide where we have to take our country, especially when we are dreaming of becoming a developed nation by 2047,"" he said, adding that we must consider what we are handing over to the next generation.While addressing a public event organised by NGO Gyanyajnah Foundation at Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, Khandare termed Pakistan a ""nonsensical"" country, to whom he said a befitting lesson was taught as per the principles of war. Khandare, who is the recipient of the Param Vishisht Seva Medal and Ati Vishisht Seva Medal among other honours, termed Pakistan a police state that often witnesses military rules and political anarchy.Calling Operation Sindoor a convergence between political desire and military action, Khandare lauded affordable, modern innovation in the country's warfare during the May Indo-Pak conflict.""We can adopt high-tech solutions where common sense is added.India fought a high-tech war during Operation Sindoor. Many people are unhappy with us and imposing tariffs,"" he said, in an indirect reference to US President Donald Trump's tariff on India.Referring to doubts cast by Pakistan over India's success during Operation Sindoor, Khandare said, ""We are not worried by their accusations, but feel pain when ‘champions' from our country raise suspicions.""Speaking on the occasion, former DRDO scientist Pralhada Ramarao said India must advance in modern warfare tactics, and steps to achieve it are being taken.""The development of modern warfare will also be beneficial for our industrial and economic growth.

Stricter laws and enforcement Awareness and community support

NEW DELHI: A 13-year-old girl from north-west Delhi's Bharat Nagar, who left home following a dispute with her father, was rescued nearly a month later after being trafficked and forcibly married off in Uttar Pradesh.She boarded a train that took her to Meerut, where two men lured her with false promises and took her to Shamli.There, she was illegally married to a 40-year-old man. A fake Aadhaar card was used to show her age as 19 years.The girl's missed call to her grandmother eventually led to her rescue. Police have arrested three men in connection with the case.Police sources said the force got a complaint about a missing girl on July 22. Despite continuous effort by the family and the police, she could not be traced at first. A case was registered under Section 137 (kidnapping) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS).""While we were searching for the girl, her family informed us that they had received a missed call from an unknown number. When they called back, a woman answered and said her daughter-in-law might have made the call, then abruptly disconnected it.The number provided by the family had one incorrect digit, and when a police team followed that lead to Mathura, it turned out to be false, a police source said. Later, after obtaining the correct phone number, the team traced the location to Shamli and rescued the girl from a home.Police later learned that the girl had left her home and taken a bus to a railway station and randomly boarded a train that led her to Meerut.While she was wandering in the station, she encountered a 20-year-old man, who promised to help her settle down. However, it was a trap. The man from Hapur, along with a 55-year-old associate from Meerut, took the girl to Shamli, where they forced her to marry a 40-year-old man on July 24 in exchange for Rs 15,000-20,000. They made a fake Aadhaar card to falsify her age as 19 years.Four days after the forced marriage, the girl was allegedly sexually assaulted by the 40-year-old man at his residence. Police are now investigating whether other minor girls — often from impoverished backgrounds — were similarly trafficked and forcibly married to older men.The duo, and the man who married the girl, have been booked under multiple sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), including charges of human trafficking , exploitation of a trafficked person, and forgery of official documents.Additionally, provisions under Sections 6 and 21 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act as well as Sections 9 and 10 of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, have been invoked against the trio.The arrests were carried out by a team from the Bharat Nagar police station. When contacted, DCP (northwest) Bhisham Singh said that the investigation was on.","A 13-year-old girl from north-west Delhi's Bharat Nagar left home following a dispute with her father.

Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority said that the total weight of the train rose to around 109 metric tonnes, which exceeded its designed capacity of 104 metric tonnes.

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Tuesday called for a mass campaign to highlight that Jawaharlal Nehru , India's first PM, had compromised the interests of the country and its farmers to make big concessions to Pakistan over Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), without taking either his Cabinet or Parliament into confidence, only to ""burnish his image"".At the NDA parliamentary party meeting for the felicitation of the alliance's VP candidate, CP Radhakrishnan, the PM told MPs to awaken the masses about the ""betrayal"" of India's interests by Nehru and how his govt had kept the treaty in abeyance.Modi, according to sources, said that India's first PM had allowed over 80% of the river's waters to be used by Pakistan, betraying the interests of Indian farmers, and it was only later that he admitted his mistake in agreeing to terms that brought no benefit to India.""Nehru partitioned the country once, and then again. Under Indus Waters Treaty, 80% of the water was given to Pakistan. Later, through his secretary, Nehru admitted his mistake, saying that it brought no benefit,"" sources quoted PM as saying at the NDA meeting.This was in contrast to Nehru's earlier defence of IWT, when he had responded to the criticism of the treaty in a parliamentary debate by, among others, BJP veteran Atal Behari Vajpayee, by saying that so much hue and cry was being raised over a few ""buckets"" of water"", Modi said, recalling that it was on a par with how the first PM laughed off the annexation of Aksai Chin by China with his remark that ""not a blade of grass grows there"".Nehru later admitted to his colleague that he had believed Indus Waters Treaty would help resolve other issues with Pakistan, but that did not happen, Modi is said to have noted at the meeting.On Aug 14, India rejected the recent award issued by the Hague-based Court of Arbitration under IWT, citing the court's lack of jurisdiction, legitimacy, and competence.Following the Pahalgam terror attack on April 22, in which 26 people were killed, India had, in an exercise of its rights as a sovereign nation under international law, placed IWT in abeyance until Pakistan credibly and irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism.IWT was signed in 1960, following nine years of negotiations between India and Pakistan, with assistance of World Bank, which was also a signatory. The treaty allocated the western rivers (Indus, Jhelum, Chenab) to Pakistan and the eastern rivers (Ravi, Beas, Sutlej) to India.","PM Narendra Modi called for a mass campaign to highlight that Jawaharlal Nehru had compromised the interests of the country and its farmers to make big concessions to Pakistan over Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) Modi said Nehru allowed over 80% of the river's waters to be used by Pakistan, betraying Indian farmers.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123397177,imgsize-875773,width-400,resizemode-4/123397177.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The recent Sino-Indian detente seemed set for a significant step forward with PM Narendra Modi saying Tuesday that bilateral ties have made ""positive and steady"" progress guided by respect for each other's interests and sensitivities, and accepting President Xi Jinping's official invitation to visit China for the SCO summit.The invitation along with a message from Xi was delivered to Modi by Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi, who called on the PM after his meeting with NSA Ajit Doval for the Special Representatives' talks on the boundary question. Recalling his meeting with Xi in Kazan in Oct, which opened the doors for normalisation of the relationship after an intense military standoff, Modi said he was looking forward to meeting the Chinese president on the margins of Eurasian bl-oc summit in Tianjin on Sept 1.""Stable, predictable, constructive ties between India and China will contribute significantly to regional as well as global peace and prosperity,"" said Modi in a post on X after the meeting with Wang.According to an Indian readout, Modi also emphasised the importance of maintaining peace on the border, and reiterated India's commitment to a fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable resolution of the boundary question.This was underlined by Doval in his meeting with Wang in which they discussed issues related to de-escalation, delimitation and boundary affairs. Wang also shared with the PM his positive assessment about his meetings with both Doval and external affairs minister S Jaishankar, saying there was ""new consensus"" on border management, maintenance of peace and on starting boundary delimitation talks. .Doval and Jaishankar strongly raised the need to fight terrorism in all its forms, underscoring that it was one of the original objectives of SCO. According to MEA, Wang, who will visit Pakistan this week, concurred that countering terrorism should be given highest priority.""The PM welcomed the steady and positive progress in bilateral ties since his meeting with President Xi in Kazan last year, guided by mutual respect, mutual interest and mutual sensitivity, including the resumption of the Kailash Manasarovar Yatra,"" said the Indian govt, adding Modi thanked Xi for the invitation and expressed support for China's presidency of the SCO Summit.Modi will arrive in Tianjin on Aug 31 for what will be his first visit to China in over seven years. He had last visited China in 2018, again for the SCO summit. SCO has been an important forum for India to assert its strategic autonomy but his visit on this occasion has evoked more than just a cursory interest, as it comes in the middle of what many see as the worst phase in India's ties with the US in decades.While the Trump administration seems to have made peace with Moscow, it continues to target India for its energy imports from Russia, accusing the Indian govt of funding Vladimir Putin's war. Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro accused India of ""now cozying up"" to both China and Russia, as he made his point about the risks involved in transferring cutting-edge US military technology to India.In his meeting with Wang, Doval hailed new energy and momentum in ties, saying with tranquillity in border areas, there had been more substantive engagement. Wang too said this year, the border situation had remained stable and was improving.","PM Narendra Modi says bilateral ties have made ""positive and steady"" progress.

Benin’s citizenship program seeks to heal history and strengthen ties with the Black diaspora

From memorial tourism to a personal journey of heritage

Russell Wilson's wife and Grammy-winning singer Ciara has made history as one of the first high-profile individuals to receive citizenship from Benin through a groundbreaking initiative aimed at reconnecting descendants of enslaved Africans with their ancestral homeland. The ceremony took place on July 26 in Cotonou, marking a symbolic moment for both the artist and the West African nation.Justice Minister Yvon Détchénou described the program as a step toward repairing deep historical wounds. “By legally recognizing these children of Africa, Benin is healing a historical wound. It is an act of justice, but also one of belonging and hope,” he said during the event.In September, Benin passed a law granting citizenship to people over 18 who can prove their lineage to victims of the transatlantic slave trade from sub-Saharan Africa, provided they do not already hold citizenship from another African nation. Applicants can submit DNA reports, authenticated testimonies, or historical family records.To streamline the process, the government launched a digital platform, My Afro Origins, allowing descendants worldwide to apply. While other African nations have opened similar pathways, Benin’s efforts carry profound weight due to its significant role in the slave trade. An estimated 1.5 million people were taken from the Bight of Benin region—modern-day Benin, Togo, and parts of Nigeria—by European traders, often with the involvement of local kingdoms.Benin has openly acknowledged its part in the slave trade, hosting conferences since the 1990s and issuing formal apologies. Today, the country invests heavily in “memorial tourism,” with historical sites like the Slave Route and the haunting Door of No Return in Ouidah serving as powerful reminders of the past.After receiving her citizenship, Ciara walked these historic paths, reflecting on their significance. “Between emotion, reflection and heritage, I experienced a profound return to what truly matters,” she shared.Benin’s coastline, once part of the historic “Slave Coast,” was a major hub in the transatlantic slave trade. From 1580 to 1727, the Kingdom of Whydah, located along today’s Benin coast, exported over a million enslaved Africans to the Americas, including the U.S., the Caribbean, and Brazil.Also Read: “Rhyme with betrayal”: Blake Lively fears friendship fallout with Taylor Swift could go public as Travis Kelce gets dragged into the drama Best known for hits like “Goodies” and “Level Up”, Ciara’s journey is more than a personal milestone—it’s a symbol of reconnection between Africa and its diaspora, inspiring others to explore their roots while acknowledging the complex history that shaped them.Russell Wilson's wife Ciara has also been credited with elevating the standard of dance, choreography, and visual art in her respective generation, and is regarded as an icon within the fields of dance, entertainment, and R&B for her contributions.On the other side, Wilson was named the Walter Payton Man of the Year in 2020 and was the recipient of the Bart Starr Award in 2022. Wilson is also part owner of the Seattle Sounders FC of Major League Soccer (MLS). After he purchased his minority stake, the Sounders won MLS Cup 2019 and the 2022 CONCACAF Champions League.Russell Wilson and Ciara exchanged vows during a secret, secluded wedding ceremony at Peckforton Castle in Cheshire, England on July 6, 2016. Attendees consisted of their closest family and friends, including Kelly Rowland, Jennifer Hudson, and La La Anthony. Both Ciara and Russell Wilson know just how to keep the love alive.The power couple, Russell Wilson and Ciara has been married for nearly a decade now, but they have some rules and traditions that keep their relationship going strong.","Russell Wilson's wife and Grammy-winning singer Ciara has made history as one of the first high-profile individuals to receive citizenship from Benin.

Full justice will be ensured in this matter,"" Saini posted on X in Hindi.Earlier, the Haryana govt on Tuesday ordered the suspension of mobile internet, bulk SMS and dongle services in Bhiwani and Charkhi Dadri districts for 48 hours from 11 am Tuesday amid public outrage over the death of the teacher.Manisha's body was found in a field in Bhiwani on August 13. She had gone missing on August 11 after leaving the school, purportedly to enquire about admission at a nursing college.

Survivors Testimony against Sean Gardner

Sean Gardner in Court

How Gardner’s Case is a Reckoning for Gymnastics

The gymnastics world is facing another devastating scandal afterwas arrested in August 2025 on federal child pornography charges. His arrest comes more than three years after he was first suspended for alleged sexual misconduct with athletes, reigniting concerns about athlete safety in a sport still reeling from past abuse cases.Sean Gardner began his coaching career at Chow’s Gymnastics and Dance Institute in West Des Moines, Iowa, a program known for producing Olympic champions like Shawn Johnson and Gabby Douglas. Joining the staff in 2018, he quickly moved up, working with junior Olympic teams and coordinating large competitions that brought in over 1,000 gymnasts each year. Gardner often described the role as his dream job, saying he wanted to inspire young athletes.But by March 2022, troubling reports emerged. A gymnast accused Gardner of using “inappropriate spotting techniques,” touching her between the legs and on private areas. She also claimed he made sexual remarks and asked minors about their sex lives. Other athletes backed up these accounts, alleging similar conduct.SafeSport, the body established to oversee athlete protection in U.S. sports after the Larry Nassar scandal, suspended Gardner in mid-2022.Despite that, he found work as a surgical technologist while the investigation into his conduct dragged on.The case escalated in May 2025 when federal agents searched Gardner’s home. Investigators uncovered evidence that painted a chilling picture:• Hundreds of pornographic images of children, some as young as six.• Hidden cameras placed inside gym bathrooms in both Iowa and Mississippi.• Electronic devices filled with thousands of images and dozens of videos.• Footage directly showing Gardner tampering with one of the hidden cameras.• Secret recordings of an adult woman, believed to be his former girlfriend, filmed without her consent.Several gymnasts later came forward with their own stories, alleging years of inappropriate touching, forced stretches that exposed them, and sexual comments during practice. Some believed Gardner had secretly recorded them with his phone.Survivors described lasting trauma, including anxiety and a deep mistrust of authority figures. Their testimonies reignited anger over whether SafeSport and other institutions are doing enough to protect athletes, especially after the high-profile cases of Larry Nassar and John Geddert.Sean Gardner, 38, appeared in federal court in Des Moines on August 15, 2025. He faces charges of producing visual depictions of minors in sexually explicit conduct, a crime that carries a possible 30-year prison sentence. He is currently being held while awaiting extradition to Mississippi for additional charges.Authorities believe more victims may come forward as the investigation expands. Advocacy groups are urging survivors of abuse in sports to seek help and use available support systems.While Gardner’s arrest is a deeply troubling development, it also serves as a stark reminder of the resilience of survivors who chose to speak out despite fear and stigma. Their voices pushed this case forward, even as the system lagged behind.The scandal highlights a broader cultural problem in gymnastics - one where prestige and reputation too often outweigh athlete safety. It echoes a troubling pattern: no matter how well-known the coach or respected the gym, silence can be broken and justice pursued, even if it takes years.If you or someone you know has been affected by sexual abuse, help is available through the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 1-800-656-HOPE.","Sean Gardner began his coaching career at Chow’s Gymnastics and Dance Institute in West Des Moines, Iowa.

Florida: Inmate executed for 1982 murder as victim’s husband looks on; state records 10th execution this year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/florida-inmate-executed-for-1982-murder-as-victims-husband-looks-on-state-records-10th-execution-this-year/articleshow/123398815.cms,"File photo: Kayle Barrington Bates and Janet Renee White (Picture credit: AP, X)





Florida on Tuesday carried out its record 10th execution of the year, putting to death Kayle Barrington Bates, who was convicted of abducting and murdering insurance worker Janet Renee White in 1982.Bates, 67, received a lethal injection at Florida State Prison near Starke and was pronounced dead at 6:17 pm (local time), according to the state’s department of corrections.Governor Ron DeSantis had signed the death warrant last month. Witnesses said Bates declined to make a final statement and refused a last meal. As per news agency AP, he was strapped to a gurney, and the execution began at 6:01 pm (local time). He was unresponsive within minutes and declared dead shortly after.White’s husband, Randy White, who witnessed the execution, described it as long-awaited justice. “I made a promise to her right after it happened that I would be there for every trial, every hearing, every appeal, and that as long as I was living, I would seek justice for her,” he was quoted as saying by USA Today. “I feel a relief that I can mentally let Renee know that justice has finally been served for her, and that’s mentally what I need.It’s always been for her.”Court records show Bates abducted White from her State Farm office in Lynn Haven, dragged her into nearby woods, attempted to sexually assault her, stabbed her to death and stole her wedding ring. He was arrested shortly afterwards, covered in blood, with the ring in his pocket.Bates’ lawyers had filed last-minute appeals, including claims of organic brain damage and racial bias in Florida’s use of the death penalty, but the Florida Supreme Court and the US Supreme Court rejected them.A federal lawsuit accusing DeSantis of discrimination in signing death warrants was also dismissed.Veterans’ groups had urged the governor to spare Bates because of his service in the Florida National Guard, but DeSantis maintained he was signing warrants for “the worst of the worst.” A spokeswoman said the execution was based solely on his crimes, not his military status.Since the US Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976, Florida’s highest previous annual total was eight executions in 2014. With Tuesday’s execution, the state has now surpassed that record, and two more executions are scheduled: Curtis Windom on 28 August and David Pittman on 17 September.Nationwide, Bates’ execution marked the 29th this year, the highest in a decade.At least nine more are scheduled before the end of 2025, according to AP.","Kayle Barrington Bates was convicted of abducting and murdering insurance worker Janet Renee White in 1982.

The White House is considering Budapest as the potential venue for a high-stakes trilateral meeting between US President Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, according to a Trump administration official and a person familiar with the discussions.According to Politico, the US Secret Service has begun preparations in Hungary, led by Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, a long-time ally of Trump. However, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt declined to confirm details, saying, “I’m not going to confirm or deny locations.”While Moscow has pushed for the talks to take place in Russia and French President Emmanuel Macron has suggested Geneva, Budapest has emerged as the frontrunner, Politico noted.Switzerland also offered itself as a host, with its foreign minister promising “immunity” to Putin despite an outstanding war crimes warrant.Hungary’s selection would be sensitive for Kyiv, recalling the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, under which the US, UK and Russia guaranteed Ukraine’s sovereignty in exchange for it giving up nuclear weapons, a pledge undermined by Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea.Despite ongoing uncertainty, momentum has built following Trump’s recent Alaska meeting with Putin.German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said a bilateral between Putin and Zelenskyy could happen within weeks, with Trump later announcing he would join them in a trilateral format as a “final step.”Russian officials, however, are said to be slowing progress. Foreign minister Sergey Lavrov told state television Moscow favoured talks that proceed “step by step, gradually.”At Tuesday’s briefing, Leavitt confirmed that “President Trump spoke with President Putin by phone, and he agreed to begin the next phase of the peace process, a meeting between President Putin and President Zelenskyy, which would be followed, if necessary, by a trilateral meeting between President Putin, President Zelenskyy and President Trump.”As per Fox News, she added that Vice President JD Vance, secretary of state Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff were coordinating efforts to make the bilateral happen “as soon as possible.”The update came a day after Zelenskyy and several European leaders met Trump at the White House to discuss next steps. Leaders praised Trump’s role, with Finnish President Alexander Stubb remarking, “In the past two weeks, we’ve probably had more progress in ending this war than we have in the past three-and-a-half years.”UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer echoed the view, saying that for years “nobody has been able to bring it to this point.” Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte added, “Without President Trump, this deadlock with Putin would not have been broken.”According to Politico, Nato defence chiefs and senior military leaders from the US, UK, Germany, France, Finland and Italy are holding parallel talks in Washington on possible security guarantees for Ukraine, including discussions over a peacekeeping mission and additional American arms.Putin, meanwhile, used his joint press conference with Trump in Alaska to endorse Trump’s long-standing claim about the origins of the war, saying, “I can confirm that” Russia would not have invaded Ukraine if Trump had been re-elected in 2020.As questions continue about long-term security guarantees for Ukraine beyond Trump’s current term, Leavitt said the president “understands the need” and is discussing future commitments with Nato and European partners.","The White House is considering Budapest as the potential venue for a high-stakes trilateral meeting between US President Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Over 50 people killed, including 17 children, in western Afghanistan after a bus carrying refugees collided with a truck and motorcycle and caught fire, according to provincial government spokesman Ahmadullah Muttaqi and local police.According to a news report from Al Jazeera, police said that the accident occurred due to the excessive speed and negligence of the bus. The bus route to Kabul was carrying refugees who were recently deported from Iran, according to provincial official Mohammad Yousuf Saeedi.They were part of a massive wave of Afghans who were deported from Iran recently.Earlier, Iranian minister of interior Eskandar Momeni announced that around 800,000 people would be deported by March.Saeedi said that all the passengers boarded the bus at a border crossing point, Islam Qala.Three passengers survived the accident after the bus collided with a motorcycle first and then hit the truck, which was carrying fuel. The collision was so strong that it led to the eruption of fire.Two people in the truck and another two on the motorcycle were among the deceased.","A bus carrying refugees collided with a truck and motorcycle and caught fire.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Tuesday asserted that US President Donald Trump is the only American leader this century to have “held Russia in check and ensured peace in Europe,” while strongly defending his recent efforts to broker an end to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict.Speaking after Trump’s meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Leavitt said history showed a pattern of Russian aggression under past administrations.“Just look at what took place during the last four administrations. Under George W. Bush, Russia invaded Georgia. Under Barack Obama, Russia took Crimea. Under Joe Biden, Russia invaded Ukraine. But under President Trump, Russia did not invade or take anything,” she said.Trump has frequently criticised his predecessors, including Barack Obama’s handling of Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. Leavitt reiterated that the current war “never would have started” had Trump been in office in 2022, adding that Russian President Vladimir Putin himself confirmed this point during their recent talks in Anchorage, Alaska.According to news agency ANI, Leavitt said the Alaska meeting was “very productive” and opened the way for “phase two” discussions at the White House within 48 hours.She credited Trump’s “relentless pursuit of peace” in his second term with breaking years of “deadly gridlock” in the conflict. “Thanks to President Trump’s efforts, we finally have movement after years of deadly gridlock,” she said.European leaders and Nato officials also backed Trump’s role, Leavitt claimed. Quoting Finnish President Alexander Stub, she said, “In the past two weeks, we’ve probably had more progress in ending this war than in the past three and a half years.”Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte was also cited as saying, “Without President Trump, this deadlock with Putin would not have been broken. He is the only one who could do this.”Leavitt announced that following discussions, Putin had agreed to a meeting with Zelenskyy, potentially followed by a trilateral summit involving Trump himself.Meanwhile, Vice President JD Vance publicly praised Leavitt for “lighting the American media up for lying about our negotiations with Russia and Ukraine” in a post on X.The press secretary accused sections of the media of “actively rooting against the president of the United States in the pursuit of peace.”She criticised coverage of Trump’s August 15 talks with Putin, saying the media wrongly portrayed them as a “defeat.”“The so-called experts in the foreign policy establishment, whose record is nothing but endless wars, trillions of wasted taxpayer dollars, and dead Americans, have the nerve to lecture President Trump,” she said, noting his record of peace deals, including the Abraham Accords.Leavitt concluded by contrasting Trump’s approach with previous administrations. “While previous presidents travelled halfway around the world to apologise for America, President Trump stands up for America, and he has firmly restored America’s status as the undisputed leader of the free world,” she said.","White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said history showed a pattern of Russian aggression under past administrations.

US President Donald Trump on Monday announced that he would lead a movement to abolish mail-in ballots and voting machines before the 2026 midterm elections, saying they fueled “massive voter fraud” and undermined confidence in the electoral process.In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said he planned to sign an executive order aimed at eliminating what he described as “highly inaccurate” and “controversial” voting machines, while pushing for traditional paper ballots with watermarks.According to Trump, paper ballots were faster, more reliable, and left “no doubt” about election results. “I am going to lead a movement to get rid of MAIL-IN BALLOTS, and also, while we’re at it, Highly ‘Inaccurate,’ Very Expensive, and Seriously Controversial VOTING MACHINES, which cost Ten Times more than accurate and sophisticated Watermark Paper,” he posted.He added that the effort, which he expected Democrats to oppose, would help bring “honesty” to the 2026 midterm elections. “We are now the only Country in the World that uses Mail-In Voting. All others gave it up because of the MASSIVE VOTER FRAUD ENCOUNTERED,” Trump wrote.Trump argued that states were merely “agents” of the federal government in counting and tabulating votes and insisted they must follow presidential directives “for the good of the country.”He accused Democrats of relying on mail-in voting to remain competitive due to their “radical left” policies. “With their HORRIBLE Radical Left policies, like Open Borders, Men Playing in Women’s Sports, Transgender and ‘WOKE’ for everyone, and so much more, Democrats are virtually Unelectable without using this completely disproven Mail-In SCAM,” Trump said.“Elections can never be honest with mail-in ballots or voting machines, and everybody knows it, especially the Democrats,” he added.Trump’s comments came days after his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Following the meeting, Trump said Putin agreed with him on ending mail-in balloting.""Vladimir Putin, smart guy, said you can't have an honest election with mail-in voting,"" Trump told Fox News after Friday's Alaska summit.Mail-in voting allows eligible voters to cast ballots through the postal system. It includes absentee ballots, used when voters cannot reach polling stations due to illness, travel, or other valid reasons, and mail-in ballots, which can be requested by any eligible voter in many states.A mail-in ballot refers to the actual ballot paper that voters complete and return by mail under this system.Although mail-in voting has long been part of the US election process, Trump has repeatedly attacked it since the 2020 presidential election, claiming it enabled widespread fraud.However, election officials and courts have found no evidence of large-scale fraud linked to mail-in ballots.Despite Trump’s opposition, several Republican-led states, including Florida, have embraced mail-in voting as a secure and convenient method of expanding voter participation. Trump himself voted by mail in previous elections and had encouraged his supporters to do the same for the 2024 presidential election.Mail-in ballots reached record highs in 2020, when states expanded options amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Usage declined in 2024, according to the US Election Assistance Commission.In the 2024 general election, more than two-thirds of voters cast ballots in person, while about three in 10 voted by mail. Every US state offers some form of absentee or mail-in ballot option, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.","US President Donald Trump announced he would lead a movement to abolish mail-in ballots and voting machines before the 2026 midterm elections.

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Monday said he would deploy 4.5 million members of the country’s militia in response to what he described as renewed threats from the United States, after Washington raised the bounty for his arrest and launched anti-drug operations in the Caribbean.""This week, I will activate a special plan with more than 4.5 million militiamen to ensure coverage of the entire national territory -- militias that are prepared, activated and armed,"" Maduro announced on state television.The militia, created by Maduro’s predecessor Hugo Chavez, is officially said to number about five million, though the real figure is believed to be lower. Venezuela’s overall population is around 30 million.Maduro denounced what he called ""the renewal of extravagant, bizarre, and outlandish threats"" from Washington.Earlier this month, the administration of US President Donald Trump doubled its reward to $50 million for Maduro’s capture. He faces US drug trafficking charges, with Washington accusing him of leading the Cartel de los Soles, a network it blames for large-scale cocaine smuggling. The Trump administration also announced sanctions against the group and the Venezuelan government last month.The US military has reportedly dispatched several vessels to the southern Caribbean as part of Trump’s campaign against Latin American drug cartels. ""We are also deployed throughout the Caribbean... in our sea, our property, Venezuelan territory,"" Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said.Though he did not directly reference the recent US actions, Maduro thanked allies for supporting Venezuela against what he called a ""rotten refrain"" of threats. He also urged the expansion of worker and peasant militias across all industries.""Rifles and missiles for the peasant force! To defend the territory, sovereignty, and peace of Venezuela,"" declared Maduro.","Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro says he will deploy 4.5 million members of the country’s militia in response to what he described as renewed threats from the United States.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Tuesday said President Donald Trump had directed that the US-Mexico border wall be painted black, arguing that the dark surface would make it too hot for migrants to climb.Speaking at a press conference in Santa Teresa, New Mexico, Noem said, ""that is specifically at the request of the president, who understands that in the hot temperatures down here, when something is painted black, it gets even warmer, and it will make it even harder for people to climb.”“Now, if you look at the structure that’s behind me, it’s tall, which makes it very, very difficult to climb, almost impossible. It also goes deep into the ground, which would make it very difficult, if not impossible, to dig under. And today, we are also going to be painting it black"", she added.Trump had signed what he called a “big, beautiful bill” last month, allocating $165 billion to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The bulk of the funds were earmarked for strengthening the southern border and deporting migrants who were in the country illegally. Of this, $46.5 billion was dedicated to the construction of the new border wall, work on which had begun during Trump’s first term in the White House.Noem said the wall would also undergo a technological upgrade with the addition of “technology, cameras, sensors.”Reports of Trump’s plans to paint the border wall black had first surfaced during his earlier administration in 2020, when officials confirmed they were testing a black coating along certain sections.","Trump administration pushes for US-Mexico border makeover; paint walls black to deter migrants.

Rescuers in Pakistan are struggling to recover bodies after flash floods triggered by relentless monsoon rains killed at least 321 people in the past 48 hours, officials told AFP on Saturday. Most casualties were reported in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where 307 people died as rivers burst their banks and houses collapsed.A video shared by RT.com showed the scale of destruction as torrents swept through towns and villages, leaving entire neighbourhoods in ruins. The floods, described by residents as “doomsday”, have left many communities cut off with relief efforts hampered by washed-out roads and ongoing rainfall.Authorities said around 2,000 rescue workers are engaged in operations across nine districts, but access remains severely restricted.“Heavy rainfall, landslides in several areas, and washed-out roads are causing significant challenges in delivering aid, particularly in transporting heavy machinery and ambulances,” Bilal Ahmed Faizi, spokesman for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s rescue agency, told AFP.“Due to road closures in most areas, rescue workers are travelling on foot to conduct operations in remote regions,” he added.Buner district has been hardest hit, recording at least 184 deaths. Other badly affected areas include Shangla, Mansehra, Swat, Bajaur and Battagram. The provincial government has declared these mountainous districts as disaster zones.Survivors have described terrifying scenes as torrents tore through homes without warning.“I heard a loud noise as if the mountain was sliding. I rushed outside and saw the entire area shaking, like it was the end of the world,” Azizullah told AFP. “The ground was trembling due to the force of the water, and it felt like death was staring me in the face.”Mass funerals were held across affected districts on Friday, with mourners grieving in front of rows of bodies covered by blankets. Local schoolteacher Saifullah Khan said: “We still have no clear idea who in this small village is alive and who is dead. I help retrieve the bodies of the children I taught, I keep wondering what kind of trial nature has imposed on these kids.”Officials warned the death toll is likely to rise further as dozens remain missing. Pakistan’s meteorological department has issued more rain alerts, warning that the intensity of the monsoon will worsen over the next two weeks.","Floods triggered by relentless monsoon rains have killed at least 321 people in Pakistan.

"Electric shocks, gang rapes & more: What happens inside Myanmar's detention centers? UN investigators reveal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/electric-shocks-gang-rapes-more-what-happens-inside-myanmars-detention-centers-un-investigators-reveal/articleshow/123256389.cms,"



A United Nations-backed investigator has revealed disturbing evidence of “systemic torture” inside Myanmar’s detention centres, describing electric shocks, strangulations, gang rape and the burning of sexual body parts among the abuses that were documented over the past year.Nicholas Koumjian, head of the international independent team investigating atrocities in the country, spoke as the group released its latest annual report on Tuesday, covering the 12 months to 30 June.The country has been in turmoil since February 2021, ever since the army overthrew Aung San Suu Kyi’s elected government, sparking a civil war. As peaceful protests were crushed with lethal force, those opposing military rule took up arms.Since then, conflict has engulfed large parts of Myanmar.The investigative team, as quoted by AP, said that it had made progress in identifying security personnel involved in detention operations, as well as “perpetrators who have summarily executed captured combatants or civilians accused of being informers.”These perpetrators included members of the security forces, affiliated militias and opposition armed groups.The report details the ""documented torture in Myanmar’s detention facilities which includes beatings, electric shocks, strangulations, gang rape, burning of sexual body parts and other forms of sexual violence,"" according to a summary of the findings.“Our report highlights a continued increase in the frequency and brutality of atrocities committed in Myanmar,” Koumjian said. “We are working towards the day when the perpetrators will have to answer for their actions in a court of law.”“We have uncovered significant evidence, including eyewitness testimony, showing systematic torture in Myanmar detention facilities,” he further added.The team also launched new investigations into atrocities committed in Rakhine state, where the military and the Arakan Army, an opposition force, are battling for control.Rakhine has long been the scene of grave abuses. More than 700,000 people from the Rohingya minority fled to neighbouring Bangladesh in 2017 to escape persecution. About 70,000 more crossed the border last year after the Arakan Army effectively seized control of the territory.The Independent Investigative Mechanism on Myanmar has been operating since 2018 under a mandate from the UN-backed Human Rights Council to document human rights abuses and violations in the country.It has already shared evidence with authorities pursuing cases involving the Rohingya at the International Criminal Court and the UN’s International Court of Justice.","U.N.-backed team releases annual report covering the 12 months to 30 June.

South Asia tensions: 3 Thai soldiers injured in landmine blast; Cambodia denies responsibility,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/south-asia-tensions-3-thai-soldiers-injured-in-landmine-blast-cambodia-denies-responsibility/articleshow/123206527.cms,".





Three Thai soldiers were injured in a landmine explosion on Saturday while patrolling near the Cambodian border, just days after the two countries agreed to extend a fragile ceasefire following their deadliest clashes in decades.The blast took place in Sisaket province at around 10 AM local time (0300 GMT), the Royal Thai Military said in a statement. One soldier sustained a severe leg injury, another suffered wounds to his back and arm, while the third experienced serious ear damage from the blast’s pressure.Tensions have been high since last month’s five-day conflict over disputed ancient temples along the 800-kilometre (500-mile) border, which left at least 43 people dead and forced more than 300,000 residents from their homes. The fighting, which involved jets, artillery, rockets and infantry, ended on 29 July after mediation by US President Donald Trump.On Thursday, Thai and Cambodian defence officials met in Kuala Lumpur and agreed to extend the truce. However, Saturday’s incident has cast doubt over the ceasefire’s stability.Thailand’s foreign ministry accused Cambodia of laying new landmines in violation of the agreement and said it would file an official protest. However the country’s Mine Action and Victim Assistance Authority denied the allegation, insisting no new mines had been planted.Acting PM Phumtham Wechayachai, who was in neighbouring Surin province at the time, has ordered the military to ensure the injured soldiers receive full treatment.","One soldier sustained a severe leg injury, another suffered wounds to his back and arm, while the third experienced serious ear damage.
