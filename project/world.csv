'Pakistan trying same tactic as Hamas': Former Pentagon official on Pahalgam terror attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-trying-same-tactic-as-hamas-former-pentagon-official-on-pahalgam-terror-attack/articleshow/120570167.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former US Pentagon official Michael Rubin on Thursday said that the recent attack in Jammu and Kashmir 's Pahalgam was akin to the October 7 attacks in Israel by militant outfit Hamas .Rubin claimed that Pakistanis were trying the same tactic as Hamas to attack a specific religion and specifically ""the most liberal"" amongst them.""That is exactly what went on when the October 7th, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel. It was directed specifically against Jews, and not only against Jews, but among the most liberal Jews who were most prone to wanting peace and normalcy with the Gaza Strip,"" Rubin said.""Targeting a vacation resort, middle-class Hindus, it is evident that the Pakistanis are trying the same tactic now. It should be no more successful for Pakistan than it was for Hamas,"" he added.Rubin also called upon India to plan an Israel-style retaliation against Pakistan and wipe out the leadership of the ISI.""And frankly, it's now the duty of India to do to Pakistan and to Pakistan's ISI what Israel did to Hamas. It's time to wipe out the leadership of the ISI, to treat them as a designated terror group, and demand that every country that is an ally of India, every country that is an ally of the world's largest democracy, do the same,"" the former Pentagon official said.Earlier, former Jammu and Kashmir Police chief Shesh Paul Vaid also claimed that the recent terrorist attack in Pahalgam was a ""Pulwama 2.0 moment"" and said that India must respond back with something like how Israel reacts to Hamas' salvos.While talking to news agency ANI, Vaid said that the terrorist attack at the picnic spot in Pahalgam was similar to the October 7 attack carried out by Palestine's terror outfit Hamas in Israel.""This was a Hamas-style attack on 7 October on Israel. It's not a coincidence that Asim Munir (Pakistan Army chief) uttered illogical words two days back, and then such an attack takes place where the religion of the tourists was asked,"" the former DGP said.""Our response should be appropriate, something like how Israel responded,"" he added.Intelligence sources have also pointed to multiple visits by senior Hamas functionaries to Pakistan over the past year.A Hamas team recently visited Jaish-e-Muhammed’s headquarters in Bahawalpur besides a Pakistani Army facility, which houses their combat simulation centre, inaugurated by Army chief Asim Munir last month. The area hosts the Bahawalpur Corps, a Pakistani military formation tasked with border defence and rapid deployment due to its strategic proximity to Rajasthan.At least 28 people were killed after terrorists opened fire on a group of tourists in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam. The gruesome terror attack in Pahalgam is one of the biggest terror attacks after the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019.According to survivors, six foreign terrorists dressed in Army fatigues identified their victims by faith, asking them to tell their names and recite Islamic verses before spraying bullets on them from close range.Gunmen struck around 1:30 pm in Baisaran meadow — about 7 km from Pahalgam and reachable either by foot or by horses — as scores of tourists were enjoying a regular afternoon, surrounded by snow-capped peaks and pine forests. Pahalgam's meadow is a top sightseeing spot that draws hundreds of visitors daily. Heavy security presence, including checkpoints and armed patrols, provided a sense of security.","Former US Pentagon official Michael Rubin on Thursday said that the recent attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam was akin to the October 7 attacks in Israel by militant outfit Hamas.

Cultural ‘invasion’ remarks of some J&K politicians now come under spotlight,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cultural-invasion-remarks-of-some-jk-politicians-now-come-under-spotlight/articleshow/120567835.cms,"The Pahalgam attack came amid statements by senior J&K netas terming the growing arrivals of non-locals, including tourists, in the UT as a demographic and cultural “invasion.""For instance, PDP neta and Pulwama MLA Waheed Parra in a recent interview highlighted the growing fears of demographic changes in Kashmir , citing the issuance of over 83,742 domicile certificates to non-natives in the last two years. He described this as a deliberate attempt to alter the region’s identity and marginalise its indigenous population. “After abrogation of Articles 370 and 35A (in 2019), there is a gripping fear among the people of J&K about possible demographic change, about being unnumbered, and about outside people being added without their knowledge. It is about us, our land.”National Conference MP Ruhullah Mehdi recently objected to non-local tourists thronging J&K. “The tourism that is now happening... I won’t call it tourism... in my eyes, it is a cultural invasion, by purpose and by design,” he had said. Mehdi had warned that just like the anger of Kashmiris against their autonomy being taken away in 1953 led to the birth of militancy 40 years later, the events of 2019 are bound to result in an angry outburst at some point of time. “We have created a wound that will someday lead to a retaliatory outburst.”Both Parra and Mehdi were, however, quick to condemn the Pahalgam attack, saying that they stand united against terror.","Senior J&K netas have described the growing arrivals of non-locals, including tourists, in the UT as a demographic and cultural “invasion” National Conference MP Ruhullah Mehdi recently objected to non-local tourists thronging J &K.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120567826,imgsize-1949705,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"
J&K terror attack: India summons Pakistan's top diplomat; hands over expulsion note,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jk-terror-attack-india-summons-pakistans-top-diplomat-hands-over-expulsion-note/articleshow/120567206.cms,"NEW DELHI: India on Wednesday summoned Pakistan's top diplomat Saad Ahmad Warraich and handed over the formal Persona non grata note for its military diplomats following the Pahalgam terror attack that claimed 28 innocent lives, including 26 Indians and two foreign tourists, news agency ANI reported citing sources.This comes after India noted evidence of cross-border linkages in the attack and said the attack came “in the wake of the successful holding of elections in the Union Territory and its steady progress towards economic growth and development.”As part of its response, India suspended the 1960 Indus Water Treaty, shut the Integrated Check Post at Attari with immediate effect, and halted Pakistani access to travel under the SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme (SVES). Any such visas issued earlier have been cancelled, and Pakistani nationals under SVES have 48 hours to leave.Additionally, the overall strength of both countries’ diplomatic missions will be capped at 30 personnel by May 1, down from 55. The Resistance Front (TRF), a proxy outfit of the banned Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba, has claimed responsibility for the Pahalgam attack, in which most of the victims were civilians. Asif said Thursday’s National Security Committee meeting reflects the gravity of the moment, noting that such sessions are held “when issues related to national security are to be discussed.”India had last downgraded diplomatic ties in 2020 by reducing the mission strength to half of what it was earlier.Earlier, Defence minister Rajnath Singh had assured the nation of a ""loud and clear"" response to the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 28 people, mostly tourists.Rajnth Singh said that the government would hunt down not only the perpetrators who carried out the ghastly attack, but also those behind the scenes.In what is being described as the deadliest assault since the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019, at least 28 tourists were killed and many others injured on Tuesday.The attack occurred in Baisaran meadow, a scenic area approximately 7 km from the resort town of Pahalgam, popular among tourists for its natural beauty and serene environment.According to survivors, six foreign terrorists dressed in Army's fatigue uniform targeted their victims based on religion. The assailants reportedly asked individuals to identify themselves by name and recite Islamic verses before opening fire at point-blank range.The attack occurred around 1:30 pm as tourists relaxed in the picturesque meadow, surrounded by snow-capped mountains and pine forests. Despite a strong security presence in the region, including multiple checkpoints and armed patrols, the attackers managed to breach defenses and unleash chaos in what should have been a peaceful tourist haven.Security forces have carried out a major manhunt, combing the area to track down the terrorists responsible. ""The search operation is currently in progress, with all efforts focused on bringing the attackers to justice,"" the Indian army's Chinar Corps said in a statement overnight.Meanwhile, the security forces also foiled an infiltration bid along the Line of Control in Baramulla.According to the Indian Army, terrorists tried to infiltrate through the general area Sarjeevan at Baramulla's Uri Nala. ""On 23 Apr 2025, approximately 2-3 UI terrorists tried to infiltrate through the general area Sarjeevan at Uri Nala, Baramulla (in north Kashmir),"" Chinar Corps said in a post on X.The alert troops on the LoC challenged and intercepted the infiltrators, resulting in a firefight, the army said.

PAHALGAM: A buzzing hill station turned into a ghost town overnight as forlorn business owners and their staff huddled in silence outside shuttered shops on Wednesday, bracing for worse.Umar Majid stood in front of his Dana Rasoli restaurant at Yanner rafting point, the entry point to Pahalgam, and spoke of how Tuesday’s carnage may have changed everything for the worse.“We are devastated by what happened,” said Umar, an arts graduate who opened his restaurant last year.“I was used to serving hundreds of customers every day. Business was so hectic that I would often miss lunch,” he said.Tuesday saw a rush of a different kind. Terrified faces filled Umar’s restaurant and other eateries nearby as soon as news arrived of the terrorist attack in Baisaran meadow. “We were as shocked as they were. We tried to console them and served free food,” he recalled.By evening, as the scale of the tragedy became clear, hotels in Pahalgam had almost emptied out.The hill station had witnessed a construction boom in recent years, with rows of hotels and inns coming up in the vicinity of the Lidder river.A police officer said around 200 private vehicles ferried tourists out of Pahalgam early Wednesday, with most heading towards Jammu through Mughal Road, which connects Shopian district of the valley with Poonch. The Srinagar-Jammu highway was temporarily closed after landslides over the weekend.A group of 15 friends braved the gloom to stay put in their resort along the Lidder. “While we mourn the deaths in the terrorist attack, we also feel sorry for the Kashmiri people,” said Sandana Silvam (42), an engineer based in the UAE.“We make a trip together every year, and we chose Kashmir this time.

NEW DELHI: The Resistance Front (TRF), proxy outfit of Pakistani terrorist Hafiz Saeed 's Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), on Tuesday claimed responsibility for the ghastly attack on tourists in J&K's Pahalgam, which claimed 26 lives.""More than 85,000 domiciles have been issued to non-locals, creating a pathway for demographic change in Indian-occupied Jammu & Kashmir (IIOJK). These non-locals arrive posing as tourists, obtain domiciles, and then being to act as if they own the land. Consequently, violence will be directed toward those attempting to settle illegally,"" the TRF said.The TRF, which was banned by the government last year, has been involved in recruiting youth through the online medium for the furtherance of terrorist activities, recruitment of terrorists, infiltration of terrorists and smuggling of weapons and narcotics from Pakistan into J&K.The group came into existence in 2019 as a proxy of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba, which was involved in numerous terror acts, including the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks.Sheikh Sajjad Gul is a commander of The Resistance Front and has been designated as a terrorist under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act 1967.TRF has been responsible for numerous attacks targeting civilians, security forces, and political figures in Jammu and Kashmir. Its operations are believed to be supported by Pakistani state mechanisms, including the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), aiming to sustain unrest in the region.In January 2023, the Indian government designated TRF as a terrorist organisation under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), and Sheikh Sajjad Gul was officially labelled a terrorist. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has since placed a bounty on Gul, reflecting the group's significant threat to regional stability.Union home minister Amit Shah arrived in Srinagar on Tuesday evening to assess the security situation in Kashmir following a deadly terrorist attack in Pahalgam that left 26 people dead.After landing, Shah headed straight to Raj Bhavan from the airport and is set to chair a high-level meeting with top security officials. He is also expected to visit Pahalgam on Wednesday.The attack, which took place in the picturesque Baisaran Valley—often referred to as “mini Switzerland”—is the deadliest targeting civilians in Kashmir since the 2019 Pulwama strike. Terrorists opened fire on tourists gathered in the popular meadow near Pahalgam, killing 26, including two foreigners and two local residents, according to a senior official.Located around six kilometers from Pahalgam town, Baisaran is a scenic meadow surrounded by dense pine forests and mountains.

NEW DELHI: In the winter of 2023, four soldiers were killed in action in J&K's Poonch and an unknown outfit named People's Anti-Fascist Front (PAFF) claimed responsibility for the attack. Months later, it claimed responsibility for another attack in Gulmarg that had resulted in four deaths, including two soldiers from Rashtriya Rifles.In the summer of 2020, a fierce gunbattle broke out in Keran, leading to multiple casualties on both sides, and the terrorists claimed to be from The Resistance Front (TRF).Both outfits had not been heard of before, but their emergence failed to fool too many. It did not take long for Indian agencies to figure out they were offshoots of notorious outfits Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), which had sought to camouflage their jihadi orientation by slipping into new sloughs.The tactical sleight of hand and rebranding of the outfits - LeT became TRF and JeM became PAFF - was prompted by the changed political landscape in J&K following abrogation of Article 370 in 2019.Rebadging has been an old practice with terrorist outfits but the switch this time to non-Islamist nomenclatures was prompted to curry favour with influential human rights groups in the West, which have been enamoured with claims of ""freedom struggle"", ""self-determination"" and ""resistance"" - in short ruses that terrorist groups employ to woo public opinion in foreign capitals.""With these seemingly innocuous monikers, groups like LeT and JeM cloaked their jihadist ideology and intensified terrorist activities in Kashmir, exploiting the rhetoric of resistance and rights to further their agenda and fuel violence, while also helping their chief backer Pakistan peddle their alibi about terrorism in J&K being a homegrown affair,"" said an officer from the security establishment.In this case, the additional motivation came from the blows that Indian security forces had inflicted on LeT and JeM while also squeezing their overground supporters, and as the two needed to rally their cadre.""By adopting monikers, both groups aimed at creating confusion among the people so that their support on the ground remained intact. This tactic, they assumed, would allow their new Mujahideens to maintain a low profile and help Pakistan avoid sanctions, and continue their nefarious activities without arousing suspicion,"" a senior intelligence officer said. Moreover, rebranding enabled them to reinvent their image, potentially appealing to new recruits and sympathisers who were deterred by their previous notoriety.The rebranding was also an attempt to evade global sanctions and dodge the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which had designated LeT as a terrorist organisation. International pressure also prompted Pakistan to pretend to take action against terrorist groups, and it had resorted to putting terrorist leaders under house arrest or imprisoning them.","In the winter of 2023, four soldiers were killed in action in J&K's Poonch.

A career cut short by family tragedy

NEW DELHI: In a shocking twist to the death of former Karnataka DGP Om Prakash, Bengaluru Police have detained his wife, Pallavi, after she allegedly threw chilli powder in his face and stabbed him to death in their HSR Layout residence.Their daughter, Kriti, has also been detained for questioning as investigators dig deeper into what appears to be a domestic dispute turned deadly.The development comes following a formal complaint filed by the deceased officer’s son, who alleged that both women had a role in the killing.According to police sources, the 68-year-old retired IPS officer was killed following a heated argument with Pallavi, who reportedly lost control and attacked him with a knife after blinding him with chilli powder, reported PTI.The murder is said to have occurred on the ground floor of their three-storeyed home on Sunday, where Prakash was found lying in a pool of blood.What makes the case more chilling is what followed: PTI sources say Pallavi made a video call to a friend immediately after the incident and declared, “I have killed the monster.”Prakash's son Kartikesh has come forward with a damning accusation that his mother Pallavi had been threatening to kill his father for a week, and that his sister Kriti pressured him to return home just two days before his death.“Due to these threats, my father had gone to stay at his sister’s house,” Kartikesh said in his police complaint. “My younger sister Kriti went there and brought him back against his will.”According to the complaint, the fatal incident came to light around 5 pm on Sunday when a neighbor alerted Kartikesh while he was at the Karnataka Golf Association. “I rushed home and found police and others already there. My father was lying in a pool of blood with injuries on his head and body. A broken bottle and a knife were found near his body,” he said, adding that his father was taken to St John’s Hospital.“My mother Pallavi and sister Kriti used to fight with my father often. I strongly suspect they are involved in his murder,” he added, urging police to take legal action.Investigators believe the murder was the result of long-standing tensions in the family, including a property dispute over land in Dandeli, Karnataka. Sources said the couple had frequent confrontations, and Pallavi had even visited the HSR Layout police station months ago to file a complaint. When her grievance wasn't taken seriously, she allegedly staged a dharna outside the police station.Pallavi is also reportedly undergoing treatment for schizophrenia and has been on medication, police sources revealed.Om Prakash, a 1981-batch IPS officer from Champaran, Bihar, had an illustrious career in the Karnataka police force. He held a Master’s degree in Geology and rose through the ranks to serve as Director General and Inspector General of Police from March 1, 2015, until his retirement in March 2017.He began his service in Ballari district as Additional Superintendent of Police and held key roles in Shivamogga, Uttara Kannada, Chikkamagaluru, the Lokayukta, and the Fire and Emergency Services.The case has sparked massive interest in Karnataka and beyond, with police sources earlier confirming the use of a weapon and visible signs of physical assault. An autopsy report is awaited, and further investigation is underway.","Former Karnataka DGP Om Prakash, 68, was found dead in his home on Sunday.

NFL and Dolphins face backlash for staying silent on Tyreek Hill’s alleged abuse and child custody controversy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/nfl-and-dolphins-face-backlash-for-staying-silent-on-tyreek-hills-alleged-abuse-and-child-custody-controversy/articleshow/120534380.cms,"Tyreek Hill accused of taking baby and kicking out wife amid explosive divorce battle (Image via LAPRESSE)

Tyreek Hill faces renewed criticism amid ongoing history of legal issues and off-field incidents

The Miami Dolphins and the NFL are currently under intense scrutiny for their silence following a recent domestic dispute involving star wide receiver Tyreek Hill. The incident, which occurred on April 7, 2025, at Hill’s residence in Sunny Isles Beach, Florida, has sparked outrage in the media and among fans.Police were called to the scene where Hill allegedly threw a laptop and took his daughter toward a balcony during a heated argument with his wife, Keeta Hill, and her mother. Although both parties insisted the situation didn’t turn physical, officers observed a bruise on Keeta’s chest, which she claimed happened accidentally. No charges were filed, and Hill was escorted out of the home by police.This is not the first time Hill has been linked to off-field controversies. In 2015, he pleaded guilty to domestic assault and battery by strangulation during his time at Oklahoma State University. In 2019, he was investigated for battery related to injuries his son sustained, though the case was closed without charges. Hill was again in the spotlight in 2023 after allegedly striking a man at a Florida marina, a case which was also dropped.More recently, in September 2024, he was detained by police during a traffic violation, which led to an internal investigation within the Miami-Dade police department. These repeated incidents have raised concerns about a pattern of behavior that continues to go unchecked.Reporter Armando Salguero of OutKick criticized the NFL and Dolphins for staying silent on Tyreek Hill's domestic violence allegations, saying it harms “the public image of the Dolphins and the NFL.” He compared it to the league's quick response to Harrison Butker's speech, noting, “The NFL was quick to distance itself from Butker, but remains silent on serious allegations involving Hill.”Salguero added that while the Dolphins have had “private discussions” with Hill, they still support him publicly. He also questioned the lack of advocacy group backlash: “The Dolphins haven’t been inundated by any advocacy organizations asking them to fire Hill.”Finally, he called out diversity officer Jonathan Beane: “Beane was quick to distance the league from Butker, but is silent about the danger Vaccaro Hill says she and her baby are in.”Despite Hill’s growing list of off-field issues, both the Dolphins and the NFL have remained noticeably quiet. The team acknowledged the most recent incident but declined to comment further, while the league has not released any statement or indicated any disciplinary action. This silence has only fueled media outrage and fan criticism, as many believe that failing to address such behavior sends the wrong message about accountability and values within professional sports.Fans and analysts have started calling for the Dolphins to part ways with Hill, arguing that his actions off the field are becoming a liability that overshadows his contributions on the field. Critics suggest that the organization’s failure to take a firm stance reflects poorly on their leadership and priorities. As the 2025 NFL Draft approaches, pressure is mounting on the Dolphins to make a decision regarding Hill’s future with the team.Also Read: Miami Dolphins ready to ditch Tyreek Hill amid off-field scandal and wife abuse accusations In the broader context, the NFL’s handling of player misconduct is once again under the microscope.

Poll How do you feel about the current state of security in Jammu and Kashmir? Very Insecure Somewhat Insecure Somewhat Secure Very Secure

NEW DELHI: Pakistan’s former cricketer Mohammad Hafeez expressed deep sorrow over the tragic terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, by posting on X (formerly Twitter): “Sad & heartbroken #PahalgamTerroristAttack.”His message, though brief, resonated widely, underlining the immense human cost of such violence and the collective grief it triggers across borders.The heinous attack, described as one of the deadliest in the region since the 2019 Pulwama bombing, claimed the lives of at least 28 civilians and left more than 20 others injured. It has shocked the nation and reignited urgent calls for united efforts to eliminate terrorism.In the wake of the tragedy, the Indian Army, Jammu and Kashmir Police, and central security agencies have launched an intensive manhunt to bring the perpetrators to justice. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah have strongly condemned the attack. Shah, in particular, delivered a powerful statement asserting the nation's unwavering resolve against terrorism.“Bharat will not bend to terror. The culprits of this dastardly terror attack will not be spared,” Shah said after laying wreaths on the bodies of the victims.Posting on X, he shared, “With a heavy heart, paid last respects to the deceased of the Pahalgam terror attack .”In another message, Shah added, “Every Indian feels the pain of those who lost their loved ones in the terrorist attack and... words cannot express this sadness.” He assured the nation: “These terrorists killing innocent people will not be spared.”As grief grips the nation, such messages serve as powerful reminders of resilience, empathy, and unity in the face of terror.","Pakistan’s former cricketer Mohammad Hafeez expressed deep sorrow over the tragic terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir.

The Pope was a staunch critic of the Donald Trump administration, its deportation, but JD Vance made it a point to pay a visit to the Pope. JD Vance wore a yellow tie for his meeting, which apparently is believed to be a symbol of optimism, indicating that JD Vance went to the Pope with an open heart, putting their past disagreements behind.Vance was not accompanied by his wife or children. “I know you have not been feeling great but it’s good to see you in better health,” these were the last words that Vance told the Pope. “Thank you for seeing me.”“I pray for you every day,” Vance said as he bid Francis farewell. “God bless you.” Vance's motorcade was on Vatican territory for 17 minutes. The vice president later joined his family for Easter Mass at St. Paul Outside the Walls, one of the four pontifical basilicas in Rome.Vance who converted to Catholicism in 2019 was at the receiving end after the Vatican announced the Pope's death. Some attacks were just for fun, while some came from those who really believe Vance to be anti-Christian. Some pointed out how Vance lied about seeing Pope in 'better health' and hours after that, the Pope died. Social media users commented that he was not supposed to say so out of courtesy when he met the Pope.Right-wing writer Ann Coulter congratulated JD Vance and wrote 'Good work, JD' soon after Pope's death providing no explanation for her message.

Tanzania opposition leader due in court on treason charge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/tanzania-opposition-leader-due-in-court-on-treason-charge/articleshow/120570644.cms,"Tanzanian opposition leader Tundu Lissu (Image: AP)

Optimism denied:

DAR ES SALAAM: Tanzania's opposition leader Tundu Lissu was set to appear in court on Thursday to face a charge of treason, which carries a potential death penalty, weeks after his party was disqualified from upcoming elections.Authorities in the east African nation have increasingly cracked down on the opposition Chadema party ahead of the presidential and parliamentary polls in October. Chadema accuses President Samia Suluhu Hassan of returning to the repressive tactics of her predecessor John Magufuli.Amnesty International has called for Lissu's immediate and unconditional release, while his deputy, John Heche, who was also briefly detained this week, has urged protests. Lissu, 57, was due at a court in Tanzania's business capital, Dar es Salaam, early Thursday.He has not been seen since a brief court appearance on April 10 when he was charged with treason, which has no option of bail, and ""publication of false information"". At the time, a defiant Lissu told supporters: ""The treason case is a path to liberation.""He has been arrested several times in the past, but this is the first time he has faced such a serious offence. The pugnacious leader has led a forceful charge against the government, promising that his party would not participate in polls without significant electoral reforms.Chadema's refusal to sign an electoral ""code of conduct"" prompted its disqualification, but the party has said the rules were designed to ""ensure that the ruling party remains in power"" and that its ban was unconstitutional.The president's party, Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), won an overwhelming victory in local elections last year but Chadema says the vote was not free or fair since many of its candidates were arbitrarily disqualified.Chadema has demanded voting reforms, including a more independent Electoral Commission and clearer rules to ensure candidates are not removed from ballots. Lissu warned last year that Chadema would ""block the elections through confrontation"" unless the system was improved.The opposition's demands have been long ignored by the ruling party. A lawyer by training, Lissu entered parliament in 2010 and ran for president in 2020. He was shot 16 times in a 2017 attack that he believes was ordered by his political opponents.After losing the 2020 election to Magufuli, he fled the country but returned in 2023 on a wave of optimism as Hassan moved to relax some of her predecessor's restrictions on the opposition and the media. Those hopes proved short-lived, with rights groups and Western governments increasingly critical of renewed repression, including the arrests of Chadema politicians as well as abductions and murders of opposition figures.In a statement following the detention of Lissu, Amnesty described a ""campaign of repression"" by authorities, criticising the ""heavy-handed tactics to silence critics"".","Tundu Lissu, 57, was due at a court in Tanzania's business capital, Dar es Salaam, early Thursday.

TOKYO: Two US marines in Japan's Okinawa are under investigation for alleged rapes, police said Thursday, the latest in a string of assault cases that have angered residents.The United States has around 54,000 military personnel stationed in Japan -- mostly on the subtropical southern island of Okinawa, to the east of Taiwan.""A US marine in his 20s is suspected of raping a Japanese woman at an American military base in March, and is also suspected of injuring another woman,"" a local police official told AFP.The second marine, also in his 20s, is suspected of raping a Japanese woman at a US base in January, the official said.Police have referred the two cases to prosecutors.Washington will cooperate ""fully"" with Japanese authorities in the investigations, said US ambassador George Glass.""We deeply value the ties of trust and friendship we have built over many decades with our Japanese hosts, and I am committed to doing everything I can to prevent actions that may jeopardise these bonds,"" he said in a statement.On Friday, US service members joined Japanese officials and residents in Okinawa for a one-off joint nighttime patrol along a downtown street dotted with bars.The patrol, the first such joint operation since 1973, followed other sexual assault cases in Okinawa involving American servicemen.A 21-year-old marine was charged with rape in June last year, just months after prosecutors charged a 25-year-old US soldier for allegedly assaulting a girl under 16.Okinawa governor Denny Tamaki called the latest cases ""deplorable"" and said authorities would urge the US military to prevent similar incidents, Japanese media reported.Japan's top government spokesman Yoshimasa Hayashi declined to comment on the cases at a regular briefing Thursday, but said crimes by US troops were ""unacceptable"".The alleged rape in March took place in a restroom, and the woman injured was trying to stop the assault on the other woman, Japanese media said, citing police sources.Relations have long been fraught between Okinawans and the US bases.Last year, a total of 80 people connected to the US military were charged in Okinawa for various crimes, police said.The 1995 gang rape of a 12-year-old girl by three US soldiers in Okinawa prompted a major backlash, with calls for a rethink of the 1960 pact allowing the United States to station troops in Japan.","Two US marines in Japan's Okinawa are under investigation for alleged rapes.

‘Elon was shouting and rambling’: Musk-Bessent clash over IRS turns heated at White House,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elon-was-shouting-and-rambling-musk-bessent-clash-over-irs-turns-heated-at-white-house/articleshow/120568942.cms,"AFP photos

A heated confrontation between Elon Musk and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reportedly unfolded last week in the White House over IRS reform . The disagreement took place in the halls of the White House and reportedly became so intense that both men were face to face and shouting, with president Trump nearby.The core of the dispute, first reported by Axios, was the fundamentally different approach each man brings to government reform. “Elon was shouting and rambling and Scott just wasn’t putting up with it,” one source told. Another added, “Bessent has two mandates: reform and stabilise. Elon has one: break things in the process of reform.”Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick was also present and, according to one source, sided with Musk during the exchange.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt responded to the incident by saying, “Disagreements are a normal part of any healthy policy process. Ultimately, everyone knows they serve at the pleasure of President Trump.”According to a New York Times report, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent believes that Elon Musk, head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), went around him to get Gary Shapley appointed as the interim head of the IRS — even though the IRS falls under Bessent’s direct authority. Trump replaced Shapley with Michael Faulkende following a reported complaint from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to the president.Musk has had previous public disputes with senior members of the administration. In November, he openly pushed for Lutnick to become Treasury Secretary over Bessent, calling Bessent a “business-as-usual” pick. He also attacked senior trade adviser Peter Navarro on X, calling him a “moron” over comments about Tesla’s manufacturing.Musk’s role as a special government employee is set to conclude at the end of May. He told Tesla shareholders he may still contribute to DOGE matters one or two days a week.","Elon Musk and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reportedly clashed over IRS reform.

A 16-year-old Virginia high school student was hospitalized with life-threatening injuries after being stabbed at school by a 15-year-old fellow student.In a press conference held after the West Potomac High School incident in Alexandria, officials with the Fairfax County Police Department confirmed that the victim is now in stable condition, People reported.Because both students are minors, their identities were not made public.“Three students got into a physical fight inside the school and one 16-year-old victim was stabbed,” Fairfax County Police Maj. Elizabeth Melendez was quoted as saying. Melendez added that a school resource officer “was with the victim within seconds, and additional officers were on the scene within minutes.”The suspect was taken into custody, and no other individuals were believed to be involved in the stabbing at the time of the press conference.“He will be charged with malicious wounding,” Melendez said of the 15-year-old.Detectives remained at West Potomac High School to investigate after the victim was transported to a local hospital.Police Chief Kevin Davis stated that the knife had been recovered from the “very active criminal investigation.” He added that school staff “acted with a sense of relentless urgency” in the moments following the stabbing to protect the students.The two teens “are known to each other,” the chief confirmed.Classes remained in session after the 15-year-old was taken off campus and the situation was contained.The county schools superintendent, Michelle Reid, said at the news briefing that lunch was on a modified schedule as staff monitored the students. She added that grief counselors were also available to students and staff.“While there’s a sense, obviously a shock, that this would happen... I’m very proud of the response of our staff to this incident,” Reid said. “They responded quickly and admirably and may have saved a life today.”When asked by a reporter why the students had to continue with classes the same day of the stabbing, Reid explained, “At this time, because of the seriousness of the incident, we want to make sure students have access to counseling services, and are not going out in the community in perhaps unsupervised settings.”One parent who did not appear on-camera in the police department's livestream seemed audibly upset at Reid’s response and the school’s “lockdown” protocol, which prohibited them from picking up his daughter who was “freaking out in there.”Davis also confirmed that a video of the fight has been posted on social media.“We have the video, just like you have the video, but the video doesn’t tell the entire story,” the police chief told reporters.","A 16-year-old Virginia high school student was hospitalized with life- threatening injuries after being stabbed at school.

Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has expressed deep sorrow and outrage over the deadly terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, that killed at least 26 people on Tuesday. Most of the victims were tourists.Taking to X, Sunak wrote, “The barbaric attack in Pahalgam has stolen the lives of newlyweds, children, and families simply seeking joy. Our hearts break for them. To those mourning – know that the UK stands with you in sorrow and solidarity. Terror will never win. We grieve with India.”The Resistance Front (TRF), a group linked to the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba, claimed responsibility for the attack. Gunmen opened fire near a popular tourist meadow close to Pahalgam town, in what has become the worst attack in the region since the 2019 Pulwama bombing.Global leaders including US president Donald Trump have voiced their condemnation and support for India. Trump called the attack “deeply disturbing” and said the United States stood firmly with India in its fight against terrorism.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who returned early from a visit to Saudi Arabia, chaired a high-level security meeting in Delhi. India has since suspended the Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan as part of its response.Earlier, Defence minister Rajnath Singh assured the nation of a ""loud and clear"" response to the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 28 people, mostly tourists.Rajanth Singh said that the government would hunt down not only the perpetrators who carried out the ghastly attack, but also those behind the scenes.","Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has expressed deep sorrow and outrage over the deadly terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, that killed at least 26 people on Tuesday.

Trump Believes He's Reached A Deal With Russia

,

US president Donald Trump said on Wednesday that he believed Russia was ready to strike a peace deal to end the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, but blamed Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy for holding up progress.Speaking from the Oval Office, Trump said, “I think we have a deal with Russia. We have to get a deal with Zelensky. I thought it might be easier to deal with Zelensky. So far it’s been harder,” news agency AFP quoted him as saying.Earlier the same day, Trump took to Truth Social to criticise Zelenskyy for rejecting any agreement that legitimises Russia’s annexation of Crimea, which occurred in 2014. Trump called this stance “very harmful” to peace efforts and accused Zelenskyy of making “inflammatory statements” that have stalled negotiations.Zelenskyy, however, has remained firm. Speaking at a press event on Tuesday, he reiterated that Ukraine’s constitution does not allow for the surrender of its territory. “There’s nothing to talk about here,” he said, referring to Crimea.Relations between the two leaders worsened after a heated Oval Office meeting in February. Trump reportedly raised his voice and accused Zelenskyy of risking global conflict. In response, Trump paused military aid to Ukraine, including intelligence sharing.Meanwhile, efforts to broker peace through high-level diplomatic meetings have faltered. US officials Marco Rubio and Steve Witkoff withdrew from scheduled talks in London, weakening the prospects of a near-term agreement. Despite this, Ukrainian officials, including presidential chief of staff Andriy Yermak, continued to meet with Western allies in the UK.Zelenskyy later acknowledged that “emotions have run high” but stressed the importance of dialogue. “Each side contributed meaningfully,” he posted online. “It is this joint work that can lead to lasting peace.”",US president Donald Trump said he believes Russia is ready to strike a peace deal to end the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.

Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro reopened his official home to the public for an Easter egg hunt on Tuesday, barely a week after a fire , started by an alleged arsonist, destroyed one of the wings at the residence.“I'm not going to live in fear,” Shapiro told reporters on the west lawn of the residence, along the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania's capital Harrisburg.He further said ""the smell of smoke is gone from the living quarters,"" adding that he hoped the fire-damaged rooms would have been ""restored by mid-summer."" However, the 51-year-old Democrat declined to detail the security improvements which have been made or would be made.The fire broke out in the early hours of April 3 as Shapiro, his wife, their children, extended family members and dogs slept upstairs, just hours after having celebrated the Jewish holiday of Passover with members of Harrisburg's Jewish community.Shapiro, 51, is the first-term governor of Pennsylvania, America's fifth-most populous state.Cody Balmer, 38, allegedly scaled the nearly 7-foot iron security gate, crossed the grounds and smashed windows with a hammer, ignited two glass bottles filled with gasoline, crawled inside, and finally slipped off into the dark minutes later. The rooms he allegedly lit ablaze were where the Shapiro family had held the Passover Seder just hours earlier.The suspected arson attack caused damage worth millions of dollars, according to fire officials, and there were no injuries. State troopers roused the governor and his family and evacuated them to safety.Balmer has been in jail since turning himself in, on charges which include attempted homicide, arson, assault and burglary. A preliminary hearing was scheduled for May 28 to determine whether the case would go to trial. He has not entered a plea.Balmer's family says he suffers from mental illness , though he denied this in court. As per officials, Balmer expressed ""hatred"" for Shapiro, and say they are investigating whether ""religious or political bias"" could explain why he ""hated"" the politician.According to police affidavits, the accused was asked what he could have done had he encountered Shapiro. He replied he would have ""hit"" the Pennsylvania governor with a sledgehammer.State police have hired a former state police commissioner, Jeffrey Miller, to conduct a security review of the governor's residence.","Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro reopened his official home to the public for an Easter egg hunt on Tuesday.

However, the Biden-era initiative to freeze territorial lines and allow Russia to retain occupied areas has met with resistance in Kyiv.Meanwhile, Trump continues to criticise Zelenskyy personally, telling reporters, “The man with ‘no cards to play’ should now, finally, GET IT DONE.” He also hinted at potential meetings with global leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, though no meetings are confirmed.Vice President JD Vance called the US proposal “very fair,” and said it’s now up to both Ukraine and Russia to accept or walk away. “It’s time for them to either say ‘yes’ or for the United States to walk away from this process.”","US president claims Zelenskyy's refusal to compromise is jeopardising peace efforts.

Twelve states sue Donald Trump administration in trade court over ‘chaotic and illegal’ tariff policy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/twelve-states-sue-trump-administration-over-chaotic-and-illegal-tariff-policy/articleshow/120566080.cms,"A coalition of 12 US states filed a lawsuit on Wednesday in the US Court of International Trade in New York, seeking to overturn President Donald Trump’s tariff policy, which they say is unlawful and has disrupted the national economy.The legal challenge accuses Trump of abusing emergency powers under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to unilaterally impose tariffs without Congressional approval. The plaintiffs argue that only Congress has the authority to levy tariffs and that the president can only invoke IEEPA in response to “unusual and extraordinary threats” from abroad — not to enact sweeping changes to trade policy.“By claiming the authority to impose immense and ever-changing tariffs on whatever goods entering the United States he chooses, for whatever reason he finds convenient to declare an emergency, the President has upended the constitutional order and brought chaos to the American economy,” the lawsuit states.The 12 states listed as plaintiffs include Oregon, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York and Vermont. They are asking the court to declare Trump’s tariffs illegal and to bar federal agencies and officials from enforcing them.Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes condemned the tariff approach in a statement. “President Trump’s insane tariff scheme is not only economically reckless — it is illegal,” she said. “No matter what the White House claims, tariffs are a tax that will be passed on to Arizona consumers.”The Justice Department has not yet responded to the suit.The multistate filing comes on the heels of a separate lawsuit filed last week by California Governor Gavin Newsom, who warned that his state — the largest importer in the US — could lose billions in revenue due to the tariffs. Newsom called the policy “the worst own-goal in the history of this country.”Responding to Newsom’s challenge, White House spokesperson Kush Desai defended the administration’s stance: “The Trump administration remains committed to addressing this national emergency that’s decimating America’s industries and leaving our workers behind with every tool at our disposal, from tariffs to negotiations.”Trump, who has imposed aggressive tariffs on China — including an additional 145% on certain imports — and threatened more on other trade partners, insists the measures are key to revitalising US manufacturing. However, the states argue that the strategy lacks legal grounding and is harming the American economy.","A coalition of 12 US states filed a lawsuit on Wednesday in the US Court of International Trade in New York, seeking to overturn President Donald Trump’s tariff policy.

Emotions have run high today: Zelenskyy's reply



The United States has dropped enough hints that it does not want to drag on with the Russia-Ukraine war and now President Donald Trump delivered the massive blow on Wednesday as he slammed Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskyy's statement on Crimea.""The situation for Ukraine is dire — He can have Peace or, he can fight for another three years before losing the whole Country.

Nobody is asking Zelenskyy to recognize Crimea as Russian Territory but, if he wants Crimea, why didn’t they fight for it eleven years ago when it was handed over to Russia without a shot being fired? The area also houses, for many years before “the Obama handover,” major Russian submarine bases. It’s inflammatory statements like Zelenskyy’s that makes it so difficult to settle this War. He has nothing to boast about!"" Trump wrote.Trump's comments came a few hours after a meeting in London aimed at bringing about an end to Russia’s war in Ukraine had been downgraded after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he wouldn’t attend.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt denied that Trump has given an ultimatum to Zelensky to accept a standing peace offer “by the end of the day,” or risk the US walking away from peace talks. “Not by the end of the day today,” Leavitt told CNN’s Jeff Zeleny, contradicting some media reports.Leavitt maintained that Trump is growing more frustrated and “he needs to see this thing come to an end.” She added that the Ukrainian president is moving in “the wrong direction” when it comes to peace talks and that Zelensky “has been trying to litigate this peace negotiation in the press, and that’s unacceptable to the president.” “His patience is running very thin,” the press secretary addedZelenskyy said that “emotions have run high today” after talks on the ongoing war in his country were held in London.Representatives from Ukraine, the United Kingdom, France, Germany and the United States met for the talks.“The sides expressed their views and respectfully received each other’s positions. It’s important that each side was not just a participant but contributed meaningfully,” Zelensky said on X, noting that “the American side shared its vision” alongside Ukraine and the other European nations.In what seemed to be an indirect response to US President Donald Trump’s criticism of Zelensky being unwilling to recognize Russian control of Crimea, Zelensky vowed Ukraine would abide by its constitution. He also shared a screenshot of former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s 2018 Crimea Declaration which rejected Russia’s occupation of the peninsula.“Ukraine will always act in accordance with its Constitution and we are absolutely sure that our partners — in particular the USA — will act in line with its strong decisions,” he said.",US President Donald Trump slammed Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskyy's statement on Crimea.

"Students SEVIS Record Restored: All 133 international students, including many Indians, win lawsuit",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/all-133-international-students-including-many-indians-who-filed-a-lawsuit-get-their-sevis-records-restored/articleshow/120562167.cms,"File photo

The Trump administration has followed the orders of the US district court (northern district of Georgia) and reinstated the SEVIS records of all 133 students who had filed this lawsuit.As reported by TOI on April 20, the court had issued issued a temporary restraining order, requiring department of homeland Security (DHS) to reinstate plaintiffs’ SEVIS records retroactive to March 31, 2025. US govt agencies were ordered to file a notice of compliance of the reinstatement by Tuesday evening.Charles Kuck, who represented the students, many of them Indians, said: “All students are now reinstated.” They can now continue to study or work under the optional practical training (OPT) programme. The next hearing is slated in the coming days.In some, but not all of the 133 cases, the state department has revoked the student’s visa. The revocation of an F-1 visa (which is granted for duration of status) does not necessarily impact the person’s lawful presence in the country. As such, plaintiffs contended it is the SEVIS registration termination that has rendered them vulnerable to devastating immigration outcomes such as detention and deportation.Increasingly, in the courts, the US agencies are taking a stand that SEVIS termination does not result in irreparable harm. Based solely on their latest contention, if a SEVIS record is terminated a student can continue with studies in the US. However, SEVIS termination notices received by students from their designated school officials ask them to self deport at the earliest as there is no grace period following a SEVIS termination. Further, it automatically terminates the work authorisation granted for an OPT programme .In a press conference American Immigration Lawyers Association 's President-Elect Jeff Joseph said, “We believe SEVIS termination does impact the status of international students. Thus, most of the lawsuits being filed are not challenging the actual visa revocation, but SEVIS termination.” He said US agencies are increasingly pointing out in court that SEVIS termination is just a credential revocation, it has no underlying impact on legal status. But this is directly contrary to their own outward facing guidance on their website, in response to inquiries as well as their own policy-guidance and training materials for DSOs.“It is our hope that if govt takes the position SEVIS termination has no impact on status, they revise their guidance... so that the kids can go back to school, to work and do what they intended to do, which is to come here and educate themselves and use that education to benefit all of us here in the US,” he added.","The Trump administration has reinstated the SEVIS records of all 133 students who had filed this lawsuit.

JD Vance Pope: Why won't JD Vance attend Pope Francis's funeral? Here's what he said,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-wont-jd-vance-attend-pope-franciss-funeral-heres-what-he-said/articleshow/120562192.cms,"JD Vance has spoken up about being one of the last few visitors Pope met hours before his death.

Why JD Vance is being trolled for a coincidence?



Vice President JD Vance was one of the last visitors of Pope Francis on Easter morning on Sunday, hours before his death on Monday. Given the antithetical relationship between the Donald Trump administration and the late Pope, JD Vance has literally been blamed for Pope's death, albeit some of it was part of internet fun. On Wednesday, as the vice president was in Agra, India, he commented on how he reflected on his meeting with the Pope hours before the Pope passed away and said it was 'pretty crazy'.On being asked as to whether he's planning to attend the funeral of the Pope, Vance said he is neither planning to attend the funeral nor planning not to attend it. He said it was not yet decided who from the government would attend the funeral.The White House, however, announced that President Trump would be attending the funeral. He would leave Washington on Friday morning to fly to Rome and return Saturday evening.JD Vance's chance meeting with the Pope hours before Pope's death is a coincidence but Vance is being mercilessly trolled for this. Right-wing American author Ann Coulter even congratulated JD Vance while commentators, comedians are not letting this opportunity to mock Vance go. JD Vance is the Internet's favorite meme and hence Vance trolling is back.“I know you’ve not been feeling great, but it’s good see you in better health,” Vance told the Pope during his brief meeting. Social media users wondered how fateful Vance's words were that the Pope died soon after.A priest serving as a translator spoke for the pope during their brief conversation.“These are for your children,” the priest said as someone presented Vance with chocolate eggs. Next came a tray of additional gifts, including rosaries and a Vatican tie.“Thank you,” Vance said as he held the dark tie. “So beautiful.”They posed for a photo, Vance standing to the pope’s right before bidding him farewell. “I pray for you every day,” Vance said. “God bless you.”Jimmy Kimmel commented that now everyone knows that JD Vance is bad at praying too.JD Vance said he thought about the chance meeting a lot. ""It’s pretty crazy, actually,” he said. “Obviously, when I saw him, I didn’t know that he had less than 24 hours still on this Earth,” Vance added. “I think it was a great blessing. But, you know, he saw a lot of people. I think he affected a lot of lives. And I try to just remember that I was lucky I got to shake his hand.”","JD Vance was one of the last visitors of Pope Francis on Easter morning on Sunday, hours before his death.

Indian student killed in Canada: Cops say Harsimrat Randhawa had just left the gym when she was shot; two vehicles recovered,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/indian-student-killed-in-canada-cops-say-harsimrat-randhawa-just-left-the-gym-when-she-was-shot-two-vehicles-recovered/articleshow/120561825.cms,"Two vehicles involved in the killing of India's Harsimrat Randhawa in Canada have been recovered, the Hamilton Police said.

The Hamilton Police on Wednesday provided an update in the Aril 17 shooting death of Harsimrat Randhawa , an Indian student, and said that they have recovered two vehicles involved in the shooting.Acting Det.-Sgt Daryl Reid told reporters at a Wednesday morning news conference that the white Hyundai Elantra was recovered on Sunday in a residential area in northwestern Toronto. It has since been towed back to Hamilton for forensic analysis, he said.On Monday, Hamilton police executed a search warrant at a central Hamilton residence and recovered the black Mercedes SUV, Reid said. The White Hyundai, police said, was probably the target vehicle towards which the shots were fired. Randhawa lost her life as she was caught in the crossfire and a stray bullet struck her chest. The shots also hit two houses in the area but no one was injured. Randhawa was taken to a hospital, where she died.Police said the 21-year-old international student who was going into her second year studying occupational physiotherapy at Mohawk College had no time to react to the bullet that immediately killed her. She had just left the gym when she was shot. ""She had taken a city bus to that location and had been waiting to cross the street. This was when she was struck by a stray bullet,"" Reid said.Randhawa had zero capability of avoiding what was about to unfold in front of her. She had just stepped off of the city bus, was waiting to cross the street, from my understanding, and everything unfolded so quickly she had no time at all to react.""""We know from watching that video that there were numerous cars that just passed through at that very moment. Many of those people have come forward and I thank those people for coming forward to assist us,"" he said.""But we know there are more people out there that might have even the smallest piece of information that could help us, and putting all of those little pieces together is what we need to do. So, we continue to encourage those people to come forward.""","Harsimrat Randhawa, an Indian student, was shot dead in Hamilton, Canada.

The United States on Wednesday launched a fresh attack on China’s economic approach, calling its export driven model “unsustainable,” which harms not only China but also the rest of the world.Speaking at the IIF Global Outlook Forum in Washington, US treasury secretary Scott Bessent stressed rising concerns around trade imbalances that US President Donald Trump hopes to address through his sweeping tariff policies.Still, Bessent insisted that, “America First does not mean America alone.”He also defended Trump administration ’s moves, labeling them as a measure to encourage ""deeper collaboration and mutual respect among trade partners,"" while fixing ""intentional policy choices"" by other nations that have weakened US manufacturing and put its security ""at risk.""Taking aim at the “status quo” of persistent global trade imbalances, warning, ""it is not sustainable for the United States, and ultimately, it is not sustainable for other economies.""His comments came amid ongoing trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies. Trump has repeatedly called out China for its trade practices and imposed sweeping tariffs in an attempt to rebalance the scales.He also called for major changes to the IMF and World Bank, saying both have strayed from their original missions.The IMF, he said “has no obligation to lend to countries that fail to implement reforms,” and said that the marker for the institution’s success should be economic stability and growth rather than money it lends out.Bessent added that the World Bank should also “no longer expect blank checks for vapid, buzzword-centric marketing accompanied by half-hearted commitments to reform.”","US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent spoke at the IIF Global Outlook Forum in Washington.
