Poll Do you believe that prison security measures are adequate to prevent jailbreaks? Yes No





KANNUR: Govindachamy alias Charley Thomas, convicted of rape and murder of a 23-year-old woman in 2011, escaped from the high-security block of the Kannur Central Prison early on Friday. The 41-year-old life convict, whose left hand is amputated, was apprehended by police within hours. He was found hiding inside a well on the premises of National Sample Survey Office at Thalap, police said.Kannur city police commissioner P Nithin Raj said the jailbreak occurred between 4.15 and 6.30am. Jail authorities discovered his absence during a morning inspection, after assistant prison officer trainees, who were out training, found clothes hanging from the prison wall along the national highway.Govindachamy had cut through the iron bars of his cell using a bar cutter and fashioned a rope out of cloth and bedsheets, police said.Jail officials are clueless on how he managed to scale the prison wall without assistance. The six-metre wall of the prison is topped with an electric fence, which is believed to have been non-functional at the time. Three prison officers on duty at the time have been suspended following a preliminary inquiry that found lapses on their part.Police launched a statewide manhunt soon after, and apprehended Govindachamy following a tip-off from a local resident, Vinoj, who spotted him in Thalap in the morning. ""I was riding my two-wheeler when I noticed a man walking slowly on the left side of the road. He looked like a beggar, and we exchanged glances briefly. I had already heard about Govindachamy's escape from prison, and something about the man I saw made me suspicious. .. When I called out his name, he immediately bolted into a narrow lane and jumped over the compound wall of an under-construction building,"" Vinoj said.Police later confirmed his identity after reviewing CCTV footage from the area. Based on this, a large contingent of officers, along with residents, intensified the search. A dog squad was also deployed. M Unnikrishnan, a NSSO staffer, spotted the convict in the well while inspecting the premises. Police, assisted by residents, apprehended Govindachamy.He was then taken to the Kannur town station and, after a medical examination, brought to the central prison for evidence collection. He was produced before the Kannur judicial first class magistrate court and remanded in custody for 14 days. He is likely to be shifted to the Viyyur high-security prison in Thrissur.Govindachamy is a native of Virudhachalam in Tamil Nadu. The 2011 case had shocked the nation and sparked a debate over women's safety on public transport. The victim, who was travelling alone on a passenger train from Ernakulam to Shoranur, was pushed out of the moving train and raped on the railway track. She later succumbed to her injuries at a hospital.","Jail officials are clueless on how he managed to scale the prison wall without assistance.

While I was trying to protect myself the machete just went through my wrist.

Political fallout and historical tensions





A deadly border conflict between Cambodia and Thailand has entered its fourth consecutive day, with both nations exchanging heavy artillery fire and reporting mounting civilian and military casualties.The hostilities, the worst in over a decade, have prompted international concern and intervention from US President Donald Trump , who urged both sides to agree to a ceasefire.The clashes, sparked by a long-running dispute over ancient temple sites and aggravated by political tensions, have already killed at least 33 people and displaced more than 150,000 along the heavily contested 800-kilometre border.Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet said on Sunday that his government was open to discussing a ceasefire and welcomed US efforts to mediate.“Just spoke to the Prime Minister of Cambodia relative to stopping the War with Thailand. I am calling the Acting Prime Minister of Thailand, right now, to likewise request a Ceasefire, and END to the War, which is currently raging,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.Hun Manet confirmed that Cambodia’s foreign minister would coordinate directly with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and work with Thailand to pursue dialogue, according to AFP.However, he also warned Bangkok against backtracking on any agreement.Thailand, meanwhile, said late Saturday that it “agrees in principle” to a ceasefire and the start of “bilateral dialogue” aimed at ending the violence. “Thailand agrees in principle to have a ceasefire in place,” the foreign ministry stated in a post on X.The Thai foreign ministry also confirmed the phone call between Trump and Acting Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai, adding: “Thailand would like to see sincere intention from the Cambodian side.”Fighting spreads to coastline as casualties mountIt further said Phumtham requested Trump to “convey to the Cambodian side that Thailand wants to convene a bilateral dialogue as soon as possible to bring forth measures and procedures for the ceasefire and the eventual peaceful resolution of the conflict.”Despite growing calls for peace, hostilities have continued. Early Saturday, fighting erupted along the countries’ coastal regions near the Gulf of Thailand, approximately 250 kilometres southwest of the main conflict zone.Cambodia’s defence ministry reported that 13 people- including eight civilians and five soldiers- had been killed on their side, with 71 injured. Thai officials said 13 civilians and seven soldiers had died in their territory.AFP journalists stationed in Samraong, a Cambodian town 20 kilometres from the conflict zone, reported hearing the consistent sound of artillery since dawn on Sunday.The conflict has forced more than 138,000 people to flee Thailand’s border regions and displaced over 35,000 inside Cambodia.“It feels like I'm escaping a war zone,” said 76-year-old Samlee Sornchai, sheltering at a temple in the Thai town of Kanthararom after fleeing his farm near the frontline, told AFP.Each side has blamed the other for escalating the violence. Cambodia accused Thailand of firing “five heavy artillery shells” into Pursat province, while Thailand alleged that Cambodia targeted civilian infrastructure, including a hospital. Cambodia has also claimed Thai forces used cluster munitions, a charge Thailand denies.Following an emergency session of the UN Security Council on Friday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged both countries to immediately cease hostilities.“The Secretary-General condemns the tragic and unnecessary loss of lives, injuries to civilians and the damage to homes and infrastructure on both sides,” said his deputy spokesman Farhan Haq.He added that Guterres remained “deeply concerned” and urged both governments to hold talks for a peaceful solution.The fighting has revived long-simmering disputes over territory and ancient temples along the rugged, jungle-covered border. A UN court ruling in 2013 settled the issue temporarily, but tensions flared again in May after a Cambodian soldier was killed in a skirmish, followed by two Thai soldiers losing limbs in landmine blasts in July.Tensions quickly escalated, reviving a century-old dispute over the 11th-century Preah Vihear temple, which both nations claim. Though the International Court of Justice ruled in 1962- and reaffirmed in 2013- that the temple and surrounding land belong to Cambodia, Thailand continues to contest a 4.6 sq km area around it, making the site a persistent flashpoint.","Cambodia open to ceasefire talks as Trump steps in too.

Hulk Hogan's travel schedule could have led to his sudden death

Hulk Hogan Dead at 71 - Bubba the Love Sponge® Show | 7/25/25

Hulk Hogan's funeral details are yet to be made public

Terry Bollea, known to the whole wide world as Hulk Hogan , was one of the biggest stars in the world of wrestling. Unfortunately, at the age of 71, he suddenly passed away after a cardiac arrest. The veteran star had quite a few surgeries on his neck and back recently, and overall, had more than 25 surgeries in his lifetime.But all the health issues did not stop him from traveling around the country and the world to meet fans and show up at events. But now, it is being said that his hectic travel schedule could be the reason behind his sudden passing, especially after his recent surgeries.Back in May, after Hulk Hogan was reportedly admitted to the hospital for neck and back issues, and had to undergo more than one surgery, it led to a few complications. So much so that rumors were afloat about him being in a coma, and his once-close friend, podcast show host, Bubba, claimed that he was on his deathbed and might not make it.Now, after Hogan's death, Bubba revealed on the latest episode of his show that it could be his hectic travel schedule that could have led to more complications for him health-wise, and ultimately became the reason for his sudden demise . He said that the doctors had suggested that the Hulkster take rest after his surgeries, but he didn't heed any advice, and was continuously on the road to promote his business and attend various events all over the country.“Had he slowed down and not thought he had to be, you know, at three or four or five different cities a week—promoting his beer, in New York promoting his new wrestling federation, in New York promoting his new sports bar, at Hogan’s Hangout every Monday night for karaoke, supposed to be at Pigeon Valley, Tennessee for the opening of the new Hogan Surf Shop... Had he slowed down and rested—the only thing that was going to repair his esophagus and the complications they had—was rest. ”If Hulk Hogan had taken the time to rest up and given his body the time it needed to heal, maybe it would not have ended in such a tragedy all of a sudden.Amid all the speculation about what led to his death, another topic of discussion among the media is about Hulk Hogan 's funeral. Fans are also trying to theorise when and where it will take place, and if he will get a state funeral, given his close ties to POTUS Donald Trump . Hulk has always been regarded as an American Hero, and many of his fans are urging for the wrestling legend to be honored with a state funeral.Hulk Hogan allegedly had a “weak heart” and was ""suffering from shortness of breath, got tired easily, had lost a lot of weight, and was on oxygen"" at the end. All the health issues definitely added to his decline, and his sudden passing after a cardiac arrest. While no revelations have been made on the details of his funeral, fans are already theorizing on when it could be and what it could entail.Also Read: Hulk Hogan's widow Sky Daily, accused of locking down his estate after his death, could inherit millions after his sudden passing","Hulk Hogan passed away at the age of 71 after a cardiac arrest.

""We were all expecting it to be the case, but when the reality of it set in, we were shocked and angry... it was very hard to listen to,"" she shared. ""I was so disappointed... we drove home in silence.""In her view, these deliverances are unjust and will have broader implications, particularly for CKSACC clients considering pressing charges.

""We have to persevere, we have to continue -- there won't be any changes in the legal or justice system unless women fight for what's right,"" she cited.""We're still going to do our campaigns and awareness and accompany women to the courthouse -- we're here to support them and they can't just give up because of this particular outcome.""

Epstein files row: House panel seeks DOJ records; aims to arrange deposition with ex-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell in August,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/epstein-files-row-house-panel-seeks-doj-records-aims-to-arrange-deposition-with-ex-girlfriend-ghislaine-maxwell-in-august/articleshow/122930943.cms,"



A key US House committee is investigating the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking case, seeking access to files from President Donald Trump 's Department of Justice and aiming to arrange a deposition with Epstein's former associate, Ghislaine Maxwell The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, under Republican leadership, launched its inquiry just as House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., adjourned the session for a month-long recess, according to the Associated Press. The move comes amid mounting calls for transparency in a case that Trump has repeatedly urged his supporters to disregard. However, this marks only the beginning of what could become a prolonged investigative process.As part of the probe, Democrats, joined by three Republicans, successfully pushed for a subcommittee to issue subpoenas. The subcommittee has pledged to protect the identities of victims while demanding broad access to “un-redacted Epstein files.”Democratic members have requested that the Department of Justice comply within 30 days of serving Attorney General Pam Bondi. The requested materials include documentation of prosecutorial decisions regarding Epstein, records related to his death, and any presidential or executive communications about the matter.Committee Chairman Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., said he had spoken with the Speaker about increased Republican efforts toward transparency concerning the Epstein files, calling it a matter of public interest.Comer expects congressional staff to conduct a sworn interview with Ghislaine Maxwell on August 11 near the Florida prison where she is incarcerated. Subjects of congressional depositions typically have legal representation present. Maxwell has already participated in interviews with the Justice Department earlier this week.Committee Republicans have also issued subpoenas for several individuals, including former President Bill Clinton, former Senator Hillary Clinton, and former attorneys general dating back to Alberto Gonzales.The Department of Justice maintains the authority to negotiate the terms of subpoenas and to argue against the disclosure of specific information. The outcome will likely depend on the administration’s willingness to engage in the traditional accommodation process with the House.","The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, under Republican leadership, launched its inquiry just as House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., adjourned the session for a month-long recess.

What does the rule say?







The Customs and Border Police Saturday issued a reminder to people traveling to the US that they are required to declare meats, fruits, vegetables, plants, seeds, soil, animal as well as plant and animal products they are carrying to the country. This is not a new rule but recently there have been several cases where non-declaration of these items got travelers penalized.The post drew attention as the social media reminder was accompanied by a photo of a CBP detection dog inspecting a cooked pig's head wrapped in aluminum foil.According to CBP rules, all travelers entering the United States are required to declare meats, fruits, vegetables, plants, seeds, soil, animals, as well as plant and animal products (including soup or soup products) they may be carrying. The declaration must cover all items carried in checked baggage, carry-on luggage, or in a vehicle.Upon examination of plants, animal products, and associated items, the CBP agriculture specialists at the ports of entry will determine if these items meet the entry requirements of the United States.If these prohibited items are bot declared by passengers, they are confiscated and disposed of by CBP. Penalties may range up to $1,000 per first-time offense for non-commercial quantities.In March, a US TikToker who was coming back home after traveling from Signapore narrated his ordeal at the JFK Airport, He declared nothing at customs but when he went to get his Uber, border agents and a sniffer dog stopped him to take a look at his bag. The dog smelled something in his bag and it was a banana about which the TikToker said he completely forgot. The CBP warned him of a possible $500 fine for bringing in an undeclared agricultural item. ""I was rightfully flabbergasted. I know what can and can’t be brought across borders — I’ve traveled my entire life, visited over 20 countries, and explored all 50 states thoroughly.

Trump is shown lying in bed with Satan arguing wth Canadian PM







The White House's first reaction to Wednesday night's South Park premiere attacking President Donald Trump is here. Trump's White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers told Rolling Stone: ""The Left's hypocrisy truly has no end — for years they have come after South Park for what they labeled as 'offense' [sic] content, but suddenly they are praising the show.""Just like the creators of South Park, the Left has no authentic or original content, which is why their popularity continues to hit record lows. This show hasn't been relevant for over 20 years and is hanging on by a thread with uninspired ideas in a desperate attempt for attention. President Trump has delivered on more promises in just six months than any other president in our country's history — and no fourth-rate show can derail President Trump's hot streak. ""After a gap of almost two and a half years, South Park kicked off its 27th season after creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone reached a $1.5 billion streaming deal with Paramount. Paramount is the parent company of Comedy Central, where South Park airs, and CBS—which has received widespread criticism over its decision to cancel The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.During the premiere episode, titled ""Sermon on the 'Mount,"" Trump is shown lying in bed with Satan, arguing with the Canadian prime minister and complaining about the size of his penis.Trump insinuates that he wants to have sex with Satan, but the devil turns him down.

'I'm all in': Alina Habba appointed acting US attorney in New Jersey; Justice Department overrules federal judges' choice,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/im-all-in-alina-habba-appointed-acting-us-attorney-in-new-jersey-justice-department-overrules-federal-judges-choice/articleshow/122897456.cms,"



Alina Habba is appointed as New Jersey’s acting US attorney, a day before her tenure as interim US attorney was set to expire on Friday.Habba made the announcement via social media that she would remain at the helm. The announcement follows the Trump administration’s decision to withdraw her nomination for the permanent role, a legal technicality that now allows her to serve as acting US attorney for up to 210 more days.A spokesperson for the Justice Department confirmed the move, while the White House reiterated President Trump’s full backing for Habba. ""President Trump continues to have full confidence in Alina Habba and her commitment to serve the people of New Jersey,"" said White House spokesperson Harrison Fields.The decision ends a tense standoff between Washington officials and federal judges in New Jersey, which had raised confusion within the office about who was legally in charge. Earlier this week, the judges had selected their own candidate, experienced federal prosecutor Desiree Leigh Grace. But shortly after, the justice department fired Grace, accusing the judges of acting politically and reaffirming support for Habba.Grace, widely respected within the justice department, had posted her willingness to serve, calling it the “greatest honor” to be chosen on merit. However, Habba’s statement the next day left little doubt about who would lead the office.“I don’t cower to pressure. I don’t answer to politics. This is a fight for justice. And I’m all in,” Habba wrote on Thursday.She followed up with a message to staff, “There has been enough noise the past four months.”“Let’s keep our focus and get back to the important work ahead for the District of New Jersey,” the New York Times cited Habba.Habba, a former personal lawyer to Donald Trump , has no prior prosecutorial experience. Since taking the role in March, she has drawn national attention for launching investigations into prominent Democrats and declaring her ambition to help ""turn New Jersey red,"" a stance that has raised eyebrows given the traditionally nonpartisan nature of the post.In a further twist, a Justice Department spokesperson confirmed that Habba resigned briefly on Thursday from the interim role and was reclassified as first assistant, a position that previously belonged to Grace, whom Habba herself had appointed as deputy earlier this year.Grace, a Republican and the first in her family to attend university, made her name as a federal prosecutor tackling gang violence. Her work, including high-profile MS-13 convictions, earned her recognition within the Justice Department. Legal peers, such as Robert Scrivo, praised her dedication and effectiveness. “I don't know that anyone did it at a higher level,” Scrivo said, as quoted by New York Times.Despite recent events, Habba had publicly acknowledged Grace’s contributions, telling colleagues in May that appointing her deputy had been the best decision of her tenure, a comment met with applause.",Alina Habba is appointed as New Jersey's acting US attorney.

'Murderers, Rapists Welcomed': Trump Ally Ted Cruz Torches Dems, Biden Over 'Criminal Aliens'





Former President Joe Biden has secured a deal with Little, Brown & Co. to pen a memoir about his White House tenure. Industry executives revealed that the untitled book, acquired through an auction by the Hachette imprint, garnered a £10 million advance, as initially reported by The Wall Street Journal.President Biden hinted that his memoir will cover his four years as President, according to NY Post.Diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer in May, the 82-year-old Biden has discussed the project at various public gatherings, expressing urgency to complete it amidst his health challenges. At a San Diego event, he stated that he was ""working like hell with a publisher"" to research and expedite a memoir focusing on his presidential period.While former presidents traditionally publish accounts of their time in office, Biden's memoir offers an opportunity to address concerns about his physical and mental capabilities, alongside presenting his presidential narrative.At an event earlier this month, Biden said that he was “working my tail off” to write a memoir. He was represented by Creative Artists Agency, which sold the worldwide rights for the book to Hachette.The agency also represented Biden for his 2017 memoir “Promise Me, Dad: A Year of Hope, Hardship and Purpose,” which chronicled his final year with his eldest son, Beau, who died from brain cancer in 2015.Having achieved his long-held presidential ambition, Biden became the oldest incumbent upon his January 2020 inauguration. He later withdrew from the 2024 electoral race amid growing concerns about his capacity to serve.Subsequently, discussions have centred on whether his close associates and party overlooked his apparent decline.Also read: Hillary Clinton flagged concerns on Biden's 'viability' before re-election bid; ex-NSA Jake Sullivan also approached Ron Klain Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson's ""Original Sin"", a significant non-fiction release this year, examines how Biden's protective inner circle disregarded his fragility, potentially compromising Democratic electoral prospects. The book achieved considerable success, with nearly 100,000 print copies sold according to Circana BookScan. Conservative publishers have responded with publications focusing on controversies surrounding his son Hunter.Presidential memoirs typically command eight-figure advances, valued for prestige as much as sales potential. Biden's memoir, however, is considerably valued lower than his peers. Barack and Michelle Obama notably secured approximately £60 million from Penguin Random House in 2017.Both Obama books achieved remarkable success: ""A Promised Land"" exceeded 2.8 million hardcover sales, while ""Becoming"" surpassed 5 million print copies, per Circana BookScan. Bill Clinton's 2004 ""My Life"" and George W. Bush's ""Decision Points"" also achieved significant commercial success with substantial advances.However, the political non-fiction market has evolved, becoming increasingly divided. Recent publications analysing the 2024 election have struggled to attract broad readership.Biden's 2017 publication ""Promise Me, Dad"", chronicling his son Beau's death from brain cancer, balanced political content with personal loss and achieved bestseller status. Other Biden family members, including his sister Valerie Biden Owens and son Hunter, have published memoirs. Jill Biden authored a 2019 memoir about their family life and several children's books.","Former President Joe Biden has secured a deal with Little, Brown & Co. to pen a memoir about his White House tenure.

In yet another jab at former US President Barack Obama, Donald Trump turned to the one thing the internet never forgets - memes - but it was JD Vance who ended up stealing the show.Trump, without any direct commentary, reposted an altered image originally shared by his son, Donald Trump Jr, spoofing the infamous 1994 OJ Simpson police chase.What was meant to be a dig at Obama quickly turned into another viral moment for the “long-haired JD Vance” meme, which has repeatedly resurfaced since Vance’s rise to national prominence.In the meme, Obama sits in the white Ford Bronco as a fugitive, with Trump pursuing in a police cruiser. But the scene-stealer? Vice president Vance, depicted as his long-haired, baby-faced college self, trailing behind in a second squad car.Earlier, Trump shared an AI-generated deepfake video showing Obama being arrested in the Oval Office by FBI agents, while Trump watched and smiled. The video, posted on Truth Social, quickly went viral.These memes and videos are coming at a time when director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard claimed that she has “overwhelming” evidence that top Obama officials fabricated the Trump-Russia collusion narrative after the 2016 election to block Trump’s presidency. She said over ""100 documents"" point to Obama directing the effort and plans to hand them over to the DOJ and FBI.","Donald Trump reposted altered image of OJ Simpson police chase.

All eyes were on the much-touted return of Kamala Harris to politics as she was named as a speaker at a youth voters event Friday in Washington, DC, but she spoke only for a few minutes and that too not in person.

"Two years on, Imran Khan's sons step in as protest call rattles Islamabad",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/two-years-on-imran-khans-sons-step-in-as-protest-call-rattles-islamabad/articleshow/122911552.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: As jailed former PM Imran Khan completes two years in prison, his sons – Sulaiman and Qasim – have stepped into the political spotlight, launching an aggressive lobbying campaign in the United States to press for their father’s release just days before Khan’s call for a nationwide protest on Aug 5, which has put the state on edge.Khan, arrested on Aug 5, 2023, remains behind bars despite some convictions being overturned. He is currently serving time in three major cases that his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), claims are part of a broader effort to keep him out of politics.He was convicted in the Toshakhana case, involving the illegal sale of state gifts received during his premiership. He was sentenced in the cipher case, accused of leaking classified diplomatic correspondence for political gain. And in the Al-Qadir Trust case, Khan and his wife were held liable for controversial land deals linked to a charitable trust.PTI has consistently maintained that the charges are politically motivated, aimed at “eliminating the most popular leader” in the country.Now, with most of PTI’s senior leadership jailed, exiled, or forced to resign, Khan’s sons have taken the international route. Based in the UK, the brothers have held meetings in Washington DC with US lawmakers, policy groups and human rights organisations, and are reportedly preparing to testify before congressional panels.Their message: Imran Khan is being held in solitary confinement in inhumane conditions, denied light, medical access, and family contact.The campaign has triggered speculation about whether the two sons might return to Pakistan, possibly to appear at the planned protest. While PTI has not confirmed this, party insiders say their presence could act as a powerful morale boost for the party’s dispersed support base.Meanwhile, the state has moved swiftly to neutralise any protest momentum. On July 22, an anti-terror court in Lahore sentenced eight senior PTI leaders, including Dr Yasmin Rashid, to 10 years in prison for their alleged role in the May 9 riots, when military installations were targeted after Khan’s initial arrest. Observers see the convictions as a tactical strike to undercut mobilisation ahead of the Aug 5 protest. The verdicts have raised concerns among legal experts about the selective use of terrorism laws against political opponents.From prison, Khan has issued a call for unity among PTI ranks, urging supporters to “shun differences” and prepare for what he called a decisive moment for Pakistan’s democracy. But the party remains fractured and leaderless, with ongoing rifts between loyalists and factions seen as open to negotiations with the establishment.At the heart of the political storm is the army chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir, who was controversially elevated to five-star rank in May. PTI blames him, along with PML-N and PPP leaders, for orchestrating what it calls a civil-military clampdown to sideline Khan and crush dissent.In a recent prison note, Khan mocked Munir as the “King of the Jungle”, accusing him of ruling the country through “fear, not law”.","Sulaiman and Qasim Khan have launched an aggressive lobbying campaign in the United States to press for their father’s release.

These falsified materials were used to meet UK immigration criteria.One such forged application, including a bogus employment letter from a non-existent hospital riddled with grammatical errors, was successfully used to secure a UK work visa, it said.UK-based immigration lawyer Harjap Bhangal blamed the nation's ""broken system"" which was ""easy to manipulate"".“If you claim asylum before that visa runs out, you can still work.

They have found their market. [It’s] quite a sophisticated scam.”Last year, Pakistanis filed 10,542 asylum applications in the UK, the highest from any single nationality and an 80% surge from the previous year, the report said citing government data.

TOI correspondent from Washington:

Asim Munir for President? Pakistan Defence Minister Denies Amid Buzz Of Asif Ali Zardari Quitting





A political and diplomatic dogfight is underway over a prospective visit to Pakistan by US President Donald Trump en route to the Quad summit in India in September amid a gradual recalibration of ties in the region.Pakistani business leaders and influencers are working overtime to convince the White House of a Trump visit after pulling off a coup by arranging a luncheon meeting last month for the country's army chief Asim Munir with the US President.Munir charmed Trump by endorsing him for a Nobel Peace Prize, playing up to his craving for one, and the Pakistanis are now promising the US President more honors and trade access if he visits, despite having thrown itself at China's feet for survival.Although the White House has not confirmed Trump's Quad attendance given New Delhi is yet to nail the dates -- which also depends on the leaders of Japan and Australia -- Pakistan's excitable media broadcast that the US President would visit Pakistan on September 18, before retracting the report because Trump will be on a state visit to the UK from September 17-19.There are indications though that Trump may stopover in Pakistan whenever he heads out to the Quad summit.This could be as late as November given the MAGA supremo's obsession with trade deals over strategic alignments. He has just delivered a tariff shock to Japan and also riled up Australia, while India has proved to be a tough negotiator, frustrating his trade boffins attempts to strong-arm New Delhi into a quick deal.In fact, Trump's fetish for tariffs and his fixation on trade deals puts a question mark over the strategic salience of the Quad even as long-time allies and partners adjust to his mercurial approach.According to some diplomats, India itself may have to reassess its approach to Trump-era Washington after a rosy-eyed view of long-term strategic ties with the US. They acknowledge that Trump’s response during his second term to the Pakistani outreach – driven more by opportunism than any strategic vision – clearly caught India off guard. New Delhi resents the re-hyphenation that would be implicit in such a two-fer, but has no way of thwarting it.If Trump does visit Pakistan, it will be the first US Presidential trip to the country in nearly two decades after George W Bush layover in 2006. Bush stopped by in Islamabad for a few hours under a tight security blanket on his way back from a three-day visit to New Delhi, talking up counter-terrorism cooperation with Pakistan while rejecting its pleas for a nuclear deal similar to the one he forged with India.Presidents Obama and Biden both disdained even a stopover while Trump himself trashed Pakistan during his first term, accusing it of ""nothing but lies & deceit"" and providing ""safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan.""Pakistan is now promising to turn itself into a safe haven for US businesses promoted by Trump associates -- including transforming Islamabad into the ""crypto capital of South Asia"" and a ""global leader in the digital finance revolution,’ -- to land a Presidential visit.During his first term, Trump is famously said to have complained about landing in Iraq and Afghanistan with the lights on Air Force One turned off (as a security measure), despite the US having spent billions on the countries. If the Pakistan stopover comes through, he may well insist on landing in full sight – to soak up the fanfare and flattery.","Pakistani business leaders and influencers are working overtime to convince the White House of a Trump visit.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan said on Monday it was creating a national paramilitary force, prompting concern among opposition parties and human rights groups that it could be used as a tool of political repression.The move turns an existing paramilitary force deployed on Pakistan’s northwestern border with Afghanistan into a national security force that will be called the Federal Constabulary, state minister for the interior Talal Chaudhry told a press conference in the eastern city of Faisalabad. Its new duties will include internal security, riot control and counter-terrorism, according to a copy of the amended law reported by the local Dunya News TV.The announcement came after Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party of former jailed PM Imran Khan said it would stage nationwide protests starting on Aug 5, the second anniversary of his arrest. Several such protests since his Aug 2023 arrest have turned violent, in some cases paralysing the capital Islamabad for days.“This will be a new force. This will be a stronger force. We need this force for internal security,” Chaudhry said, adding that President Asif Ali Zardari had already approved amendments in the law introducing changes in the paramilitary force.The new force replaces the Frontier Constabulary (FC), whose cadres were previously recruited only from tribes in the northwestern province, Chaudhry said.Training of the new force will bring it into line with other national law enforcement agencies, he added. Khan’s party spokesperson Zulfikar Bukhari said the changes should be subject to parliamentary discussion.The new force “should not be used as a gimmick to silence political opponents, as has been previously witnessed when the government applied such laws against a large number of the PTI leadership and supporters,” he said. His concern was echoed by Haris Khalique, secretary of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, an independent body. “We are alarmed by the changes being made to the security and law enforcement structure of the country without any debate in parliament,” Khalique said.REUTERS","The move turns an existing paramilitary force deployed on Pakistan’s northwestern border with Afghanistan into a national security force.
