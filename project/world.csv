India skips vote on Ukraine resolutions as US faces setback in UNGA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-skips-vote-on-ukraine-resolutions-as-us-faces-setback-in-unga/articleshow/118539238.cms,"The UN Security Council votes on Feb 24, 2025, at the United Nations headquarters.

Europe-backed resolution seeks withdrawal of Russian troops

Amid high drama at the UN over the 2 resolutions that were brought in the UN General Assembly on the third anniversary of the Russia-Ukraine war – one by the US and other by Ukraine and Europe – India abstained from voting on both. Both resolutions were adopted with 93 votes in favour, as EU members seemed to prevail over the Americans in mustering support from the 193-member body for comprehensive peace and for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.The voting for the US effort, which sought a swift end to the conflict, was more dramatic as the US itself abstained from voting on a resolution it had sponsored.This was because the European countries managed to successfully introduce amendments in the text. India, which maintains that it is not neutral but on the side of peace, was expected to vote in favour but the amendments meant that Indian too had to abstain.India was also among the 65 countries that abstained from voting on the Europe-backed resolution that called for just and lasting peace, and also immediate withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine. This was in line with its earlier abstentions in the Assembly on resolutions condemning Russia.India officially continues to maintain that it wants both parties involved to restart the dialogue and diplomacy process to resolve the conflict. The Trump administration has been engaging directly with Russia to end the war, keeping both EU and Ukraine out.While the defeat in the General Assembly is a setback for the US, it will look to make up for it in the Security Council, hoping that France and UK will not veto it. Both countries have not used their veto power for decades. The voting was expected to take place later in the day. With effectively just one paragraph, the US resolution seeks lasting, and not just and lasting, peace and calls for a swift end to the conflict between the 2 countries. If approved, it will be the first real resolution to be adopted by the Council on the issue since the beginning of the war. The only 1 adopted so far was days after the Russian invasion of Ukraine for a special emergency session in the Assembly on Ukraine.EU member states had sought 3 amendments in the US draft resolution, including replacing “Russia-Ukraine conflict” with “the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation”.It also called for reaffirming the UN’s commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders, including its territorial waters. The third was a mention of “just, lasting and comprehensive” peace and not just lasting peace. Russia’s amendment for addressing the “root causes” of the conflict was rejected.","India abstained from voting on the 2 resolutions brought in the UN General Assembly on the third anniversary of the Russia-Ukraine war.

Row over praise for rivals: Should Congress be wary of Shashi Tharoor?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/row-over-praise-for-rivals-should-congress-be-wary-of-shashi-tharoor/articleshow/118537166.cms,"Shashi Tharoor

NEW DELHI: Shashi Tharoor is no pushover in politics. And the Congress knows that. In October 2022, the former UN dilpomat-turned politician surprised many in the Congress when he announced to contest elections for the post of Congress president against Mallikarjun Kharge - who was the ""nominee"" of the Gandhis. Tharoor fought the elections against all odds with little support from any one in the party and managed to get 1,072 votes against Kharge's 7,897.Tharoor, who then already had the rebel tag around him as a member of G-23 (group of Congress leaders who had written a letter to Sonia Gandhi seeking reforms in the party), braved the risk of being labeled an open dissident to put forth his views on reviving the Congress - which had been on a constant decline since its shocking defeat in 2014. He batted for decentralising authority and empowering the grassroots office-bearers of the party.The former UN diplomat-turned-politician, who has won four consecutive Lok Sabha elections from Thiruvananthapuram, has once again challenged the Congress leadership with his praise for party's political rivals - both at the national and the state level.The Congress MP, who has never been afraid to speak his mind, was once again under fire for his comments praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the United States and his thumbs up to entrepreneurial growth in Kerala under the LDF government.As expected, the Congress pushback was strong and immediate. But Tharoor, in keeping with his combative style, instead of taking a step back took digs at the party leadership with a cryptic social media which said ""it is a folly to be wise."" The message was loud and clear - the Thiruvananthapuram MP was once again ready to fight the battle within the party.Tharoor, who was reportedly unhappy over being sidelined in the party - both at the national and the state level, had a one-to-one closed-door meeting with Rahul Gandhi and later claimed that the conversation was ""very good"" though he did not divulge any details.The Kerala Congress leader however remained defiant about his article praising the Left Front government and said he was happy that it had ‘done some good' as it had opened a scope for discussion on the issue.According to reports, Tharoor in a yet to be telecast podcast has said that he is ready to explore other options if the Congress did not need his services.What may worry the Congress that this time around there are some voices of support for the embattled leader. Echoing the sentiments of Tharoor, another senior party leader Rashid Alvi, said there was a need to bring senior and ground-connected politicians into Congress mainstream.""Congress party has many senior, seasoned, and ground-connected politicians. We should bring them into the mainstream of the party. This will make Congress stronger. If we do not bring these experienced individuals into the mainstream, it will harm the party,"" Alvi said.This is not the first time that Alvi has given a message to the party leadership. Recently when Congress contested the Delhi elections with full vengeance against Arvind Kejriwal and played a key role in AAP's defeat, Alvi had then spoken against the leadership decision to divide votes and help the BJP in process.And while Alvi was diplomatic in his attack, Sanjay Jha, former Congress spokesperson, who was pushed out of the party following airing his differences, was more direct in his attack. Sanjay Jha wrote an open post on X addressed to Rahul Gandhi explaining why he needed to bell the cat.""I am writing to you publicly here because no one within the Congress is probably going to tell you this. So as usual, let me bell the cat. Leadership ( corporate or political or any other) is about having difficult conversations. It is about trouble-shooting.

Chatterjee, a resident of Chandernagore in Bengal, was traveling to Gaya in Bihar for work when the accident occurred around 12.30am. While Chatterjee, seated in the front passenger seat, bled to death, at least two of her colleagues suffered injuries.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: In a grisly pre-planned murder spree Monday evening, a 23-year-old youth killed his girlfriend, brother, grandmother, uncle and aunt, and also attempted to hack his mother to death with a machete and a hammer, at three different places at Venjaramoodu in Thiruvananthapuram, before surrendering to police.The accused, Affan, told cops that he had killed six family members as they were reluctant to clear off the huge debts he had incurred after suffering losses in his business in a Gulf country. However, police have doubts over his version and are digging deeper to unearth more details. The mobile phone and call details of the accused are being checked to ascertain if he is addicted to drugs.Affan's mother Shemi (47), a cancer patient, is in ICU and remains critical. Affan, too, was admitted to the hospital as he claimed to have consumed rat poison to end his life. During the medical examination, however, doctors could not confirm the presence of any poison in his body. Police said the accused first murdered his grandmother Salma Beevi (88) at her Pangode home at about 3pm. He then reached the house of his paternal uncle Abdul Latheef (58) at SN Puram near Koonanvenga, some 16 km from Pangode, and murdered him and his wife Shahida Beevi (54).Affan then returned home at Perumala near Pullampara, and attacked his mother, brother Afzan (14) and girlfriend Farshana (19). After committing the crime, he went straight to the Venjaramoodu police station in an autorickshaw and surrendered.

The DMK demands the total withdrawal of this Bill and appeals to the Union govt to respect the autonomy of the legal profession,” Stalin said in the post.Stalin’s attack on Centre comes in the backdrop of a political slugfest between DMK and the BJP-led Union govt over New Education Policy (NEP). Stalin has been alleging that NEP will not be implemented in TN as it imposes Hindi and intrudes into the state's education policy.Scaling up the attack on the BJP, Stalin said the Advocates Amendment Bill was also against Tamil.“The BJP’s aversion to Tamil is evident in this Bill, as it wants to rename the Bar Council of TamilNadu and Puducherry as the Bar Council of Madras. TN is not just a name; it is our identity,” Stalin said.He said the BJP govt has been systematically undermining the independence of the judiciary since 2014 when it came to power. This was done first by trying to hijack judicial appointments through the National Judicial Appointments Commission and then by ignoring the collegium's recommendations for judicial appointments and transfers, he said.“Now, by seeking control over bar councils, it aims to weaken judicial independence ,” he added.Earlier, Stalin said Tamil Nadu is losing out to other states in the delimitation exercise due to population control. Speaking at a marriage function of a DMK functionary here, Stalin said that TN was in a disadvantageous position due to its efficient implementation of population control measures as less population means fewer parliamentary seats in the delimitation exercise. Nevertheless, he urged people to limit the number of their children.He also reiterated that TN will not adopt the three language policy even if it means losing out ₹10,000 crore.",Stalin’s attack on Centre comes in the backdrop of a political slugfest between DMK and the BJP-led Union govt.

Taylor Swift has been sacked from Instagram after being booed at the Super Bowl

Taylor Swift has been facing backlash from Instagram after being booed at the Super Bowl, according to SportsMillions. Conservative fans, including Alexis Winters of Queens, believe the drop in followers and booing signals Swift should focus on music and avoid politics.Travis Kelce, boyfriend of Taylor Swift, has gained over 12,370 followers on Instagram following his Super Bowl loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, according to SportsMillions, which used Social Blade to track their social media stats.Taylor Swift's Instagram following has plummeted to over 144,200 followings following the Super Bowl LIX controversy , according to SportsMillions data, causing speculation about the reasons behind the backlash.Swift's presence at the Super Bowl, where she supported her boyfriend, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, was met with mixed reactions. Some fans were excited to see her, while others expressed frustration, particularly those who disagree with her political stances. Some speculate it stems from her growing political influence.Alexis Winters, a member of the New York Young Republican Club, attributed the decrease in followers to a broader sentiment among certain conservative fans. ""We are tired of celebrities calling down to us from their ivory towers, giving their two cents on policies that will never impact them,"" Winters stated.She further added, ""Taylor Swift is simply the best example of this, and her loss of hundreds of thousands of Instagram followers represents the hundreds of thousands of Americans who chose their president over the woke Hollywood mob.""While Taylor Swift's Instagram followers declined, Kelce gained over 12,370 followers after the Super Bowl, according to Social Blade tracking. Some fans argue that Swift's criticism is unfair, especially when compared to Kelce's reception. ""I mostly think it's equally maddening and unsurprising how people seem more eager to celebrate the man dating a successful woman than the actual woman herself,"" said Sara Koger, 32, of Buckeye, Arizona.Jenna Piwowarczyk, a leader of the ""Swifties for Trump"" movement, expressed disappointment over Swift's treatment during the game. ""When Travis made an appearance on the Eras Tour, Swifties were excited to see him and cheered him on. When Taylor was shown on the Jumbotron, she was booed,"" Piwowarczyk noted. ""I understand the demographic of the Super Bowl attendees are not fans of Taylor Swift, but the generalized hatred towards her for simply supporting her boyfriend is uncalled for and gross.""Also read: Travis Kelce’s ex Kayla Nicole stuns in a viral Fenty ad, blending seduction and empowerment that could make Taylor Swift nervous Taylor Swift's influence remains strong, with her Eras Tour becoming the highest-grossing concert tour of all time.

New York City is terminating a $220m deal with the Pakistan-owned Roosevelt Hotel to house a migrant shelter following a prolonged MAGA meltdown over use of American taxpayer money to facilitate immigration to the US.Under pressure from the federal government and MAGA hardliners, Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat who gravitated to the Trump orbit after facing corruption charges from the Biden administration, announced closure of the site that is said to have housed tens of thousands of migrants in its 1025 rooms at $ 200 a night.The site opened in May 2023 to serve as both a new arrivals center and shelter for asylum seekers under a three-year $ 220 million deal with government-run Pakistan International Airlines, which owns the hotel, having bought out a Saudi stake in it for $ 36.4million in 2005.At peak traffic in 2023 when around 4000 migrants were arriving in the city each week, the sight of asylum seekers camping outside the hotel waiting to be processed triggered MAGA hardliners and even some New Yorkers, as Trump and his supporters complained about Democrats housing ""illegal immigrants"" in ""luxury hotels"" at the expense of US taxpayers.""A taxpayer-funded hotel for illegal migrants is owned by the Pakistani government, which means NYC taxpayers are effectively paying a foreign government to house illegals in our own country. This is nuts,"" Trump acolyte and MAGA major Vivel Ramaswamy had raged.Trump himself, lately exercised over a $ 21 million USAID allocation for a voter turnout program in India, had highlighted the purported scam saying the Biden administration had paid $ 59 million to an unspecified hotel in New York City to house illegal immigrants. Standing beside him, Musk had added that the city was paying double the normal rate for the room.Following the Trump victory, his new administration cited concerns about criminal activity at the hotel for freezing $80 million in FEMA funds to the city, by which time Pakistan had already raked in tens of millions of dollars.""FEMA was funding the Roosevelt Hotel that serves as a Tren de Aragua base of operations and was used to house Laken Riley's killer.

Trump, GOP will 'collapse' in 30 days, predicts James Carville

Veteran Democratic strategist James Carville has forecasted that Donald Trump’s administration will experience a “massive collapse” within 30 days, citing a decline in public approval and internal instability .Speaking to Mediaite’s Dan Abrams, Carville argued that Trump’s leadership is already “in the midst of a collapse” and advised Democrats to stay out of the way while it unfolds.Carville urged Democrats to avoid direct confrontation, suggesting they “play possum” and allow the administration to self-destruct. “It’s going to be easy pickings here in six weeks. Just lay back. We’re in the midst of a collapse. It’s over,” he said. He argued that progressive advocacy groups pushing for aggressive opposition are “worse than useless” and that Democrats should “just let it go”.Despite Carville’s claims, recent polling does not indicate a dramatic collapse. A JL Partners/DailyMail.com poll showed Trump’s approval rating at 53%, his highest since the election, while an Emerson College poll found it had dipped slightly to 48%.A CNN/SSR poll recorded a 47% approval rating, as per The Daily Mail.Carville, however, insisted the administration was facing its lowest approval ratings for any president at a comparable time. He also predicted Republicans would struggle to pass legislation due to their slim House majority and potential resistance from Democrats.The US is just a month away from a possible government shutdown . If Congress fails to pass a spending package, federal programs—including military pay, disaster relief, and aid for low-income Americans—could be halted.Carville suggested Republicans might be forced to negotiate with Democrats to keep the government functioning, reported The Mirror.Trump has made several controversial foreign policy statements, including comments blaming Ukraine for its war with Russia and suggesting Gaza could be turned into the “Riviera”.Meanwhile, his administration has aggressively pursued spending cuts through Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). This has led to mass layoffs of federal workers and resistance from some agencies over transparency demands.Carville remains certain that Trump’s administration is on the verge of failure. “I think they know exactly what they’re doing and they know exactly what’s going to happen,” he said, adding, “I’ve never been mistaken”.However, given that he previously predicted Kamala Harris would win the presidency, his forecasts should be taken with caution.",Veteran Democratic strategist James Carville predicts Donald Trump's administration will collapse within 30 days.

AI to decide mission-critical roles

Second email warning

Trump calls the plan ‘genius’

'Against the law'

The department of government efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk , plans to use artificial intelligence (AI) to analyse responses from federal employees who were instructed to justify their jobs via email. The AI system will determine whether their work is considered essential, according to sources quoted by NBC News.This initiative by the tech billionaire is part of a broader effort to reduce federal spending, remove inactive staff, and implement job cuts, allegedly to 'fire' those who do not respond before the given deadline. Federal employees were instructed to email five accomplishments from the past week, with failure to comply resulting in resignation.The responses, which were solicited through an email from the US Office of Personnel Management (OPM) over the weekend, will be fed into a Large Language Model (LLM). This advanced AI system will process the information and assess whether an employee’s role is deemed necessary.Federal workers received the email on Saturday, just after Musk posted on X that “all federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week. Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.”The OPM message itself, however, did not mention resignation. Instead, it asked workers to reply with “approximately five bullets of what you accomplished last week” and to copy their manager. Employees were instructed not to include classified information, links, or attachments—something sources say was necessary to facilitate AI processing.On Monday, the justice department informed its employees that responding to the email was voluntary. An internal email stated that, during a meeting with the Chief Human Capital Officers Council, OPM clarified that not replying to the request would not be considered a resignation—contrary to Musk’s original post.Despite this, Musk doubled down on his criticism of federal workers on X, writing:""The email request was utterly trivial, as the standard for passing the test was to type some words and press send! Yet so many failed even that inane test, urged on in some cases by their managers. Have you ever witnessed such INCOMPETENCE and CONTEMPT for how YOUR TAXES are being spent?""Later, he suggested that employees who failed to respond might receive a second email, warning:""Subject to the discretion of the President, they will be given another chance. Failure to respond a second time will result in termination.""US President Donald Trump backed the effort on Monday, calling it a “great” move during a press event with French President Emmanuel Macron.“We have people that don’t show up to work and nobody even knows if they work for the government. So by asking the question ‘tell us what you did this week,’ what he's doing is saying are you actually working,” Trump said.He claimed that many employees were not responding because “they don’t even exist.”The move has sparked legal challenges. A coalition of unions and advocacy groups, already fighting the administration’s large-scale layoffs of probationary workers, has amended its lawsuit against OPM. The lawsuit argues that the directive was issued unlawfully and should be blocked.Lawyer Norm Eisen, representing the plaintiffs, criticised the policy: “The mass firings ordered by OPM are illegal and betray the trust of countless federal employees. The patronising demand that federal workers still on the job have to justify themselves by enumerating five accomplishments just adds insult to injury. That too is against the law.”Some government agencies, including those led by Trump allies, have advised employees to ignore the directive.At the justice department, assistant attorney general for Administration Jolene Ann Lauria sent an internal message instructing employees that they did not need to comply, citing the “confidential and sensitive nature” of the department’s work.“If you have already responded to this email, no further action is needed,” Lauria’s email said.","Federal employees were instructed to email five accomplishments from the past week, with failure to comply resulting in resignation.

‘Outrageous’ arrest

Foreigners held by Taliban

Taliban authorities have detained two British nationals, a Chinese-American citizen, and their Afghan translator, Afghanistan’s interior ministry confirmed Monday night, after the daughter of the British couple urged the UK government to intervene for their release.Ministry spokesperson Abdul Mateen Qani told news outlet AFP that the individuals were detained “based on certain considerations” and that efforts were ongoing to resolve the matter.However, he did not disclose details about their condition or the reasons for their detention, adding only that “details will be released shortly.”The confirmation follows Sarah Entwistle, urged the British government to do “everything in their power” to secure the release of her parents, Peter and Barbie Reynolds , during an interview with the British media. The couple, who have lived in Afghanistan for decades, were allegedly arrested on 1 February in Bamiyan province, home to the giant Buddhas that were destroyed by the Taliban in 2001.Entwistle revealed that she and her three brothers initially refrained from contacting UK authorities, “hoping to hear directly from the Taliban about why they'd arrested our parents,"" she told Times Radio.“Our parents have always sought to honour the Taliban, so we wanted to give them the opportunity to explain their reasons for this detention.”“However, after more than three weeks of silence, we can no longer wait. We're now urgently calling on the British consulate to put as much pressure as possible on the Taliban for their release,” she added.The couple, who married in Kabul in 1970, chose to remain in Afghanistan even after the Taliban came to power in 2021, despite the withdrawal of British embassy staff.According to The Sunday Times, the couple’s detention may be linked to their work teaching parenting skills to mothers over 30.“My mother is 75, and my father is almost 80. He needs his heart medication after suffering a mini-stroke,” Entwistle told the newspaper.""They were just trying to help the country they loved. The idea they are being held because they were teaching mothers with children is outrageous.""The couple were reportedly arrested while returning to their home in Bamiyan.In an open letter to Taliban authorities quoted by the Sunday Times, their children pleaded for their release, “We do not understand the reasons behind their arrest,” adding “Our parents have consistently expressed their commitment to Afghanistan.”Last month, former Canadian soldier David Lavery was released after two months in captivity following negotiations brokered by Qatar.Before that, two Americans—Ryan Corbett and William McKenty—were freed in exchange for an Afghan fighter convicted of narco-terrorism in the US. However, two other Americans, George Glezmann and Mahmood Habibi, remain in Taliban custody.Since retaking control of Afghanistan in 2021, the Taliban have imposed strict Islamic laws, rolling back freedoms, particularly for women and girls. Girls are banned from education beyond age 12, and women face severe restrictions in the workplace and public life—policies the United Nations has described as “gender apartheid.”","Two British nationals, a Chinese-American citizen, and their Afghan translator have been detained by the Taliban.

United Nations - LIVE

In a break from its European allies, the United States aligned with Russia at the United Nations , voting against a resolution condemning Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine on Monday.The move, under newly elected US President Donald Trump , has strained US-Europe ties and raised doubts about Washington’s shifting stance on the Russia-Ukraine war.The UN general assembly vote saw the US and Russia opposing a Europe-backed Ukrainian resolution that directly accused Moscow of aggression and demanded an immediate withdrawal of Russian troops. The resolution was passed with 93 votes in favour, 18 against, and 65 abstentions.The US then abstained from voting on its competing resolution after European nations, led by France, successfully amended it to blame Russia explicitly. Trump’s administration had initially proposed a resolution that called for peace but notably omitted any reference to Russian aggression. After the European amendments were added, the US backed away from its own draft, abstaining from the final vote, while Russia opposed it. The revised resolution still passed with 93 votes in favour, 8 against, and 73 abstentions.The US later pushed for a vote on its original draft in the UN security council , where resolutions are legally binding. The 15-member council approved it 10-0, but five European nations abstained.The two resolutions exposed tensions between the US, Ukraine, and European leaders. Trump’s choice to negotiate directly with Moscow, leaving out Ukraine and European allies, has shaken the transatlantic alliance.The shift was further underscored by Trump’s rhetoric. He recently called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a ""dictator,"" falsely accused Ukraine of starting the war, and warned that Zelenskyy “better move fast” to negotiate peace or risk not having a country to lead. Zelenskyy hit back, saying Trump was living in a Russian-made ""disinformation space.""Trump hosted French President Emmanuel Macron in Washington on Monday, with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer expected to visit later this week. Just weeks ago, these key US allies were united on Ukraine, but now find themselves at odds with Washington’s evolving position.US deputy ambassador Dorothy Shea defended Washington’s approach, arguing that previous UN resolutions condemning Russia had failed to stop the war. “What we need is a resolution marking the commitment from all UN member states to bring a durable end to the war,” she said.Furthermore, Ukrainian deputy foreign minister Mariana Betsa insisted that Ukraine was exercising its “inherent right to self-defence” and urged nations to take the “side of the Charter, the side of humanity and the side of just and lasting peace, peace through strength.”The general assembly has taken on a central role in addressing the war, as the security council remains paralyzed by Russia’s veto power. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the general assembly has passed multiple resolutions condemning Moscow and demanding an immediate troop withdrawal.The Ukrainian-backed resolution adopted on Monday reaffirmed these demands, insisting that no territorial gains made through aggression should be recognised as legal. It also called for an urgent end to hostilities this year.Russia’s UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia described the US-drafted resolution as ""a good move"" before the European amendments were added. Moscow also proposed its own amendment calling for the ""root causes"" of the conflict to be addressed, but this was not included in the final text.","The US and Russia opposed a Europe-backed Ukrainian resolution that directly accused Moscow of aggression.

However, the region has a history of cross-border tensions, including frequent livestock raids. While Kenya has deployed additional police reservists to maintain order, attackers often retreat into Ethiopian territory, making security operations difficult.In response to the latest violence, Murkomen announced plans to set up a formal border post, where all individuals crossing into Kenya will undergo security checks.","Violence allegedly broke out on Saturday near the Omo river, between Ethiopian and Kenyan fishermen.

French President Emmanuel Macron directly challenged US President Donald Trump during their meeting at the White House, pushing back against Trump's assertion that European nations were merely loaning money to Ukraine rather than providing substantial financial aid. During the meeting, Macron forcefully corrected Trump’s claim that European nations would eventually be reimbursed for their contributions.“No, in fact, to be frank, we paid,” Macron insisted. “We paid 60% of the total efforts, and it was through grants, not loans. We provided real money.” He emphasised that Europe had frozen Russian assets worth approximately $230 billion, clarifying that these were not being used as collateral but could eventually be part of a settlement with Russia.Trump, who appeared undeterred, responded, “It's okay with me, but they get their money back. We don’t, and now we do.”The exchange highlighted broader disagreements between Trump and European leaders over the approach to Ukraine. While Trump has indicated he wants a quick resolution to the war, Macron has been firm that any peace deal must not come at the cost of Ukrainian sovereignty.“This peace must not mean a surrender of Ukraine,” Macron said at a joint press conference. “It must not mean a ceasefire without guarantees.”Trump, meanwhile, claimed he was making progress in securing a deal that would see Ukraine grant the US access to its critical minerals, an arrangement he argued would help repay some of the $180 billion in American aid provided since the war began. He also suggested that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy might visit Washington soon to finalise the agreement.European leaders have been wary of Trump’s foreign policy approach, particularly his reluctance to explicitly blame Russia for the invasion. At the United Nations, the US abstained from voting on a resolution condemning Russia after European nations pushed to name Moscow as the aggressor. Macron, speaking ahead of his meeting with Trump, warned against any signs of weakness towards Russian President Vladimir Putin.“It’s in the joint interest of Americans and Europeans not to be weak in the face of President Putin,” he said. “How can you then be credible in the face of China if you’re weak in the face of Putin?”Trump, however, has been vocal about his belief that Putin is open to negotiating a resolution. “I really believe he wants to make a deal,” Trump said. “I may be wrong, but I believe he wants to make a deal.”","French President Emmanuel Macron challenged US President Donald Trump during their meeting at the White House.

US Secret Service agent Clint Hill who leapt into action to shield former US President John F. Kennedy and first lady Jacqueline Kennedy during the assassination in Dallas on November 22, 1963, has died at the age of 93.Hill's family announced on Monday that he passed away peacefully at home.Clint Hill's quick actions running to the presidential limousine and climbing aboard to shield the first couple became one of the most unforgettable moments of that tragic day. He protected Jackie Kennedy, but the thought that he could have done more to save the president stayed with him.Hill was born in Larimore, North Dakota and served in the Secret Service under five US presidents: Dwight Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, and Gerald Ford. He was initially disappointed when assigned to the first lady’s detail in 1960, considering it a demotion. However, that role placed him at the centre of history three years later.On the day of JFK's assassination in Dallas, Hill was on the running board of the car behind the president’s limousine. When he heard the first gunshot, he reacted instantly, sprinting towards the vehicle. Before he could reach Kennedy, two more bullets struck the president. As seen in Abraham Zapruder’s 26-second film, Hill climbed onto the moving limousine, shielding Jacqueline as she reached toward the back of the car. He then guided her back to her seat and covered both her and the mortally wounded president with his body as the motorcade rushed to Parkland Hospital.At the hospital, Jacqueline was reluctant to let go of her husband's body until Hill removed his suit jacket and used it to cover the president’s gruesome head wound. He later helped arrange a casket and accompanied Jacqueline and the president’s body aboard Air Force One for the journey back to Washington.Though widely praised for his bravery, Hill struggled for years with guilt, believing he could have done more. In a 1976 interview with CBS' 60 Minutes, he broke down in tears, saying, “If I had reacted just a little bit quicker… I'll live with that to my grave.” Journalist Mike Wallace later described him as “the most stricken and tormented man” he had ever interviewed.For decades, Hill battled depression, nightmares, and alcoholism, and was eventually forced to retire at 43 due to post-traumatic stress disorder. In 1990, he revisited Dealey Plaza, the site of the assassination, to confront his demons. “I did everything I could that day,” he later said, “but I still had that sense of guilt and responsibility.”Hill continued to serve as a Secret Service agent after Kennedy’s assassination, protecting Jackie Kennedy for a year before being reassigned to President Johnson. He later worked under US vice president Spiro Agnew before retiring in 1975.With his wife, journalist Lisa McCubbin Hill, he co-authored four books about his experiences: Five Presidents: My Extraordinary Journey With Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon and Ford, Mrs. Kennedy and Me, Five Days in November, and My Travels with Mrs. Kennedy.In a statement, the US Secret Service honoured his legacy, calling him “a worldwide symbol of courage” and praising his “unwavering dedication and exceptional service.”Hill is survived by his wife, sons, and grandchildren. His career spanned some of the most pivotal moments in American history, including the Cold War, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Vietnam War, the civil rights movement, and Watergate.Tributes poured in from across the nation, honouring Hill’s bravery and dedication. Top officials and celebrities took to X to express their condolences and pay respects. Among them were Donald Trump's border czar Tom Homan, British media personality Piers Morgan, White House Correspondents' Association President Kelly O'Donnell, and journalist James Rosen, all recognising Hill’s remarkable service.","Clint Hill was on the running board of the car behind the president’s limousine.

Second smoke-related incident in days

Toronto crash-landing leaves eight injured

A Delta Air Lines flight was forced to return to Atlanta on Monday morning after a smoky haze filled the cabin, prompting an emergency evacuation on the runway, reports New York Post.The Boeing 717, operating as Delta Flight 876, was en route to South Carolina with 99 passengers and crew on board when the pilot turned the aircraft back to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport around 8.30 am.As the plane landed, all passengers were evacuated via emergency slides. No injuries were reported.“We are being evacuated off the plane,” a passenger said in a video shared by 11Alive News. “I recorded the whole time. I recorded the evacuation, smoke and all.”Footage taken before landing showed passengers covering their noses inside the hazy cabin.Another passenger told CNN that haze began to fill the plane five to 10 minutes after taking off from Atlanta.“A few of us passengers started to question why or what was going on. People started screaming ‘smoke, smoke, smoke,’” the passenger said. “We were in the air for about 20 minutes, and it seemed to take a while before we landed.”A Delta spokesperson confirmed the incident, saying, “The flight crew followed procedures to return to Atlanta when haze inside the aircraft was observed after departure. Nothing is more important than the safety of our customers and people, and we apologise to our customers for the experience.”The federal aviation administration (FAA) has launched an investigation into the incident.Monday’s emergency landing came just two days after another Delta flight, bound for Australia, was forced to return to Los Angeles due to smoke in the galley.Flight DL43 had taken off from Los Angeles International Airport for Sydney before the crew detected smoke and decided to turn back. The Airbus A350-900, carrying 162 passengers, landed safely.“Nothing is more important than the safety of our customers and people,” a Delta spokesperson said at the time. “That’s why the flight crew followed established procedures to return to Los Angeles (LAX) after smoke was detected in the galley. We apologise to our customers for the delay in their travels.”The aircraft landed without incident and taxied to the gate normally.Last week, another Delta aircraft flipped upside-down and caught fire after landing at Toronto Pearson International Airport.Delta Flight 4819, which had departed from Minneapolis, crash-landed on a snowy runway, leaving eight people injured. Images and videos from the scene showed the plane upside-down with passengers and crew evacuating the wreckage.Everyone on board survived the crash. Delta later offered each passenger $30,000 in compensation, but the airline now faces legal trouble as the first lawsuits from the accident have already been filed.",Delta Flight 876 was en route to South Carolina with 99 passengers and crew on board when the pilot turned the aircraft back to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport around 8.30 am.

Delta Plane Crash Toronto Pilot: Who is Kendal Swanson?

In a shocking incident, a Delta Airlines flight turned upside down after crashing on the runway at Toronto Pearson International Airport on Monday becoming the latest in a series of aviation mishaps. There was no fatality as all 80 people including the crew managed to crawl out of an upside-down plane. 21 of them were taken to hospital with injuries and by Thursday morning all of them were released.As the harrowing incident is under investigation, Delta reportedly announced a payoff of $30,000 to each of the passengers which raised suspicion as to whether the airlines want to silence the passengers. But reports claimed that taking the money will have no strings attached and the passengers can still sue the airlines for the life-threatening crash-landing.Speculations are rife on social media that the airlines has not revealed the identity of the pilots to safeguard their DEI (diversity, equity and inclusivity) hiring policies. Many viral posts indulged in a gender blame game claiming that all pilots were female -- though the gender had no link to the mishap and Delta did not release any details about the pilots -- neither their names nor gender.Kendal Swanson is the only name doing rounds on X. It has been claimed that she was the pilot of the plane but there were other pilots and the captain -- and these claims are not verified.One viral post with a photo of Kendal Swanson claimed that she was not experienced enough for the landing while the runway was covered in snow. The post said she was an instructor pilot for a small propellor aircraft a year ago and she recently received her licence. Others countered the claims and many questioned who the captain of the flight was as it was the captain's fault to give the landing to an inexperienced pilot, if the claims were true at all.According to the screenshot attached to the viral post, the PIC (pilot in command) was James and the FO (First Officer) was Kendal and the flight attendants were Hollie and Rebecca. Social media users asked if James was the captain, then it was not Kendal's fault. Delta said the pilots on that flight were very experienced.","A Delta Airlines flight turned upside down after crashing on the runway at Toronto Pearson International Airport on Monday.

Leanne Lucas, a yoga teacher who was repeatedly stabbed during the Southport attack , spoke to BBC about how she managed to save several children despite her injuries.The attack, which took place during a Taylor Swift-themed class, left three young girls dead and several others injured. The attacker, Axel Rudakubana, was sentenced to a minimum of 52 years in prison.Lucas recalled the moment the attacker entered. “He opened the door and grabbed a child. I didn’t understand what was happening at first,” she said. “Then he grabbed another, and another. That’s when I shouted, ‘Who is that?’” She said she struggled to remember the next moments clearly because the attacker then came towards her. “I felt something in my back, and my brain just said: He’s got me. Then he stabbed me again.”Despite being seriously injured, Lucas and her friend, dance teacher Heidi Liddle, managed to help some children escape. Lucas suffered multiple stab wounds to her spine, head, ribs, lung, and shoulder blade. “He was bigger than me, and I knew I needed help. We started shouting, ‘Run!’ and I called 999 from the landing,” she said. “All I could think about was getting the children out.”Even while bleeding and in pain, Lucas kept trying to get help. “I just kept repeating, ‘There are children inside. There are children inside,’” she said. “My mind was racing, but my body wasn’t keeping up. People were asking me questions, but I just kept saying, ‘Go and get the children.’” She added, “The police later told us that if Heidi and I hadn’t acted, we would all be dead.""Lucas spoke about how difficult life has been since the attack. “I found out he pleaded guilty from the news. It made me angry. We all knew he did it, and he waited until the trial to say ‘guilty'.""Despite everything, Lucas said she is determined to keep going. “The only reason to survive is because I got out. I’m alive. The girls aren’t, so I have to stay alive for them. Otherwise, what’s the point?” She described the young victims as full of life and happiness. “These children represented goodness. Pure goodness. Their love of life, their energy—that’s how I remember them.”","Leanne Lucas, a yoga teacher who was repeatedly stabbed during the Southport attack, spoke to BBC about how she managed to save several children despite her injuries.

Tensions rise as federal agencies tell employees to ignore Elon Musk ultimatum,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tensions-rise-as-federal-agencies-tell-employees-to-ignore-elon-musk-ultimatum/articleshow/118535573.cms,"File photo: Members of the American Federation of Government Employees rally to protest the Trump administration's widespread government workforce reductions, outside the US Capitol building in Washington. (Samuel Corum/The New York Times)

Why it matters

This marks the most significant internal resistance yet to Musk’s government overhaul, revealing fractures within the Trump administration.

Musk’s directive was initially backed by Trump, who has long sought to slash the size of the federal government.

But even some of Trump’s closest allies, including newly confirmed FBI director Kash Patel and top officials at the Pentagon, are questioning its legality and practicality.

and top officials at the Pentagon, are questioning its legality and practicality. Federal workers' unions have slammed Musk’s move as “plainly unlawful” and are threatening legal action.

The big picture

Musk’s aggressive efforts to shrink the federal workforce have already led to the firing of tens of thousands of employees and voluntary resignations of thousands more. But this latest ultimatum is testing how far his authority really extends.

FBI director Kash Patel: Ordered bureau employees to ignore Musk’s demand, stating that performance reviews would be conducted under existing FBI procedures.

Ordered bureau employees to ignore Musk’s demand, stating that performance reviews would be conducted under existing FBI procedures. Pentagon leadership: Told employees to pause any response to the email, emphasizing that personnel reviews would be handled internally.

Told employees to pause any response to the email, emphasizing that personnel reviews would be handled internally. State department: Acting undersecretary Tibor Nagy assured employees that department leadership—not individual workers—would respond to Musk’s mandate.

Acting undersecretary Tibor Nagy assured employees that department leadership—not individual workers—would respond to Musk’s mandate. Department of health & human services(HHS) flip-flop: Initially told employees to comply, then reversed course, directing them to pause responses pending further guidance.

The conflicting guidance is creating chaos among the federal workforce, leaving employees unsure whether they will face consequences for noncompliance.

What they’re saying

The backlash is not just coming from Democrats—some Republicans are also expressing concerns about Musk’s approach.

Senator John Curtis (R-Utah): “If I could say one thing to Elon Musk, it’s like, please put a dose of compassion in this. These are real people. These are real lives. These are mortgages. It’s a false narrative to say we have to cut and be cruel about it.”

Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md): “The actions he’s taking are illegal.”

Trump’s response? Instead of addressing the controversy directly, the president posted a meme mocking federal workers on his social media platform, depicting their supposed accomplishments as “Cried about Trump,” “Cried about Elon,” and “Read some emails.”

Meanwhile, unions representing federal workers are preparing for a legal battle.

Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), called Musk’s order “unelected and unhinged,” adding: “Employees have no obligation to respond to this plainly unlawful email.”

The AFGE has demanded that OPM rescind the request and issue an apology by the end of the day.

Between the lines

The uproar highlights the broader tensions between Musk’s “move fast and break things” mentality and the bureaucratic structure of the federal government.

Unlike his private companies—where he swiftly slashed staff at X (formerly Twitter) and imposed strict work requirements—Musk is running into legal and institutional barriers in Washington.

Under federal law, most civil servants cannot be fired without due process, making it unclear whether Musk’s “failure to respond = resignation” policy is even enforceable.

Some federal employees worry that responding could violate security protocols, particularly in intelligence and law enforcement agencies.

Zoom in: The legal question

Musk has provided no clear legal justification for his mandate, and experts say it likely violates federal employment protections.

Mark Maxin, a former federal labor attorney: “Musk has no authority. He’s not in the chain of command for these employees, so issuing a direct order under the threat of termination is a clear overreach.”

Michael Fallings, federal employment lawyer: “This wouldn’t hold up in court. The federal workforce isn’t Twitter—these workers have rights and protections Musk doesn’t seem to understand.”

While Musk’s order was sent through OPM, the HR arm of the federal government, some agencies are questioning whether OPM even has the authority to issue such a directive.

The fallout: Federal workers caught in the middle

Millions of government employees are heading into the workweek unsure whether to comply with Musk’s demand.

An IRS worker told Reuters: “I really wonder when someone is going to say enough.”

A CDC official called the email “unprofessional and just plain creepy.”

Veterans Affairs medical staff are scrambling to figure out how to respond, given that their work is patient-driven and not easily summarized in bullet points.

Even intelligence agencies received the email—despite their work often being classified.

Tulsi Gabbard, Trump’s director of national intelligence, ordered intelligence officials not to respond, citing national security concerns.

What’s next

With the Monday night deadline looming, tensions are escalating behind the scenes.

The White House has yet to clarify whether Musk’s order is legally binding.

If agencies continue to resist, it could set up a broader power struggle between Trump’s appointees and Musk’s cost-cutting efforts.

If federal employees refuse to respond, will Musk follow through on his threat to fire them? And if he does, will the courts intervene?

Meanwhile, Trump has remained largely silent, beyond cheering on Musk’s aggressive tactics on social media.

The bottom line

A growing number of federal agencies—including the FBI, state department, and Pentagon—are telling their employees to ignore Elon Musk ’s latest directive: Submit a list of five work accomplishments from the past week or risk termination.The resistance comes after Musk, appointed by President Donald Trump to lead the newly created department of government efficiency ( DOGE ), issued a sweeping mandate via email on Saturday night.The message, sent from an office of personnel management (OPM) address, instructed federal workers to respond by 11:59pm Monday with their achievements. Musk later posted on X that “failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.”The order has sparked confusion and pushback across the federal workforce, with some agencies instructing employees to comply, while others—led by Trump appointees—are refusing to enforce it.What started as a simple request for work reports has spiraled into a high-stakes battle over government authority, labor rights, and Musk’s unchecked power.Federal agencies are resisting, unions are preparing lawsuits, and legal experts say Musk’s order won’t hold up in court.But for thousands of federal workers, the uncertainty is real—and the fate of their jobs could hinge on a billionaire’s tweet.(With inputs from agencies)",Musk’s aggressive efforts to shrink the federal workforce have already led to the firing of tens of thousands of employees and voluntary resignations.

Tennessee suspect in dozens of rapes gets 95 years for child sex abuse images and escape convictions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tennessee-suspect-in-dozens-of-rapes-gets-95-years-for-child-sex-abuse-images-and-escape-convictions/articleshow/118543286.cms,"(AP photo)

NASHVILLE: A Tennessee man accused in lawsuits of drugging and sexually assaulting dozens of women received a 95-year prison sentence Monday for other types of offenses: the production of child sex abuse images and an escape from an inmate transport van.Judge J. Ronnie Greer in Greeneville called Sean Williams an unrepentant ""organized, methodical sexual predator of women and children,"" according to the Johnson City Press. Prosecutors said Williams, who was already in prison, had razor blades in his shoes on his way to court.Williams, 53, congratulated a prosecutor for a ""dramatic performance"" during Monday's hearing in federal court and implied the images were faked or doctored. Williams laughed, shook his head and retorted when the judge said the only thing worse he could imagine would be being a serial killer.Earlier this month, Johnson City officials voted to pay $28 million to settle a lawsuit filed by women under ""Jane Doe"" pseudonyms against the city and individual police officers that claimed police deliberately botched investigations over sexual assault allegations against Williams from 2018 to 2021.Williams has not yet been criminally charged as a result of the women's allegations in the lawsuits.The city and the officers have long denied corruption allegations, including a claim in the women's lawsuit that Williams paid police to obstruct investigations into sexual assault allegations against him. The settlement broadly includes up to 400 women, including minors, who lodged any report of sexual abuse or trafficking to Johnson City Police from 2018 through December 2022, due to accusations of gender discrimination. The settlement still requires court approval.A campus police officer at Western Carolina University in Cullowhee, North Carolina, found Williams asleep in his car in 2023 while he was fleeing a federal felon-possessing-ammunition charge in April 2021.His vehicle contained cocaine, methamphetamine, about $100,000 and digital storage devices with more than 5,000 images of child sexual abuse. Williams was also in possession of photos and videos showing him sexually assaulting at least 52 women at his Johnson City apartment while they were in an ""obvious state of unconsciousness,"" police wrote.At least half a dozen names on folders containing videos of women were consistent with first names on a list labeled ""Raped"" that Johnson City officers had previously found in his apartment, a police affidavit said.After being charged in connection with the child sexual abuse images , Williams in October 2023 escaped from a van taking him from a Kentucky detention center to a hearing in Tennessee. Authorities caught him in Florida more than a month later.He was convicted in July of the van escape and in November of the child sex abuse images of a 9-month-old boy, a 4-year-old girl and a 7-year-old girl. Prosecutors said Williams also raped the children's mothers while they were unconscious and that there were images and videos of them as well. Williams took the sexually explicit photos of one child in 2008 and the other two on separate occasions in 2020, all in his apartment, prosecutors said.In Tennessee state court, Williams faces additional charges involving minors. In a North Carolina federal court, he's charged with possessing child sexual abuse images and illegal drugs.Two other federal lawsuits against Johnson City and individual police officers are still pending over the investigation of sexual assault reports against Williams.","Judge J.

Putin mocks Zelenskyy, calls him ‘toxic’



Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday backed a suggestion by US counterpart Donald Trump that Russia, the United States, and China should all cut their defence budgets in half, saying it was a ""good proposal"" and that Russia was ""ready for a discussion.""""I think it's a good idea. The US would cut by 50 percent and we would cut by 50 percent and then China would join if it wanted,"" Putin said in a televised interview.Russia has significantly increased military spending since launching its offensive in Ukraine in 2022, fuelling economic growth but also inflation.

""We could come to an agreement with the US (on cutting spending), we're not against it,"" he said. ""We think it's a good proposal and we are ready for a discussion about this.""Putin also addressed the role of European nations in potential peace negotiations for Ukraine, saying their participation was ""in demand,"" despite past reluctance.""I see nothing wrong with this,"" Putin said when asked about European involvement in talks. ""Well, probably no one can demand anything here. Especially not from Russia.""

He framed the discussions as an effort to ""improve the level of trust"" between Moscow and Washington.""Both in his recent phone conversation with Trump and at the meeting in Riyadh, problems related to the Ukrainian crisis were touched on,"" Putin said. ""But it was not discussed in essence.

He suggested that Zelenskyy was losing credibility among Ukraine's military for giving ""ridiculous orders"" and had become ""toxic in society as a whole.""The Russian leader contrasted Zelenskyy with Ukraine’s former military commander-in-chief Valery Zaluzhny, who was recently appointed Kyiv’s ambassador to London.

'Macron's a smart customer': Trump

Trumps praises Macron speaking French

First handshake occurred in Brussels

French President Emmanuel Macron and US President Donald Trump revived their famously tactile diplomacy on Thursday, exchanging hugs, handshakes, and backslaps during their meeting. However, despite the warm gestures, the two leaders did not see eye to eye on every issue—particularly when it came to discussions on Ukraine.The longstanding public camaraderie between the two leaders, evident since Trump's initial presidency, continued as Macron arrived for another meeting, though with underlying complexities.During their Oval Office discussion, disagreements emerged regarding Trump's changed stance on Russia and Ukraine, despite Macron's attempt to maintain cordiality through physical gestures.In an unprecedented move for an Oval Office visitor, the French leader halted his 78-year-old counterpart mid-speech when Trump incorrectly stated that Europe was merely extending loans to Ukraine.""No, in fact, to be frank"" said Macron, touching his US counterpart's arm to stop him mid-sentence, ""we paid 60 percent of the total effort and it was -- like the US -- loans, guarantees, grants.""Trump responded with a smirk, stating: ""If you believe that, it's ok with me.""Despite their divergent views on Ukraine, their personal rapport remained evident throughout the meeting.""He's a smart customer,"" Trump remarked, tapping the 47-year-old's upper arm whilst recounting an incident in Paris where he discovered discrepancies between what the French leader had communicated in French about a trade agreement and what had been conveyed to him.Macron responded by holding Trump's hand as they shared laughter, with Macron appearing to wipe away tears of amusement. Their arrival at the West Wing was marked by an embrace and a firm handshake.Trump also responded to Macron speaking in French by praising the language, saying, “That is the most beautiful language… I have no idea what he said, but it is the most elegant, beautiful language.”During their joint press conference, they paused after opening remarks to share another handshake and photo opportunity, whilst exchanging mutual admiration.Macron spoke of their ""friendship from your first term"" as Trump praised the Frenchman's efforts in restoring the fire-damaged Notre-Dame cathedral. Trump concluded the press conference by sending regards to Macron's wife.While diplomatic relations typically involve symbolic gestures, Macron and Trump have been particularly obvious in their use of physical interactions to establish presence.At their joint media briefing after discussions, Macron emphasised that European countries need to strengthen their continental defence capabilities. However, he cautioned against yielding to Russian demands.""This peace must not mean a surrender of Ukraine,"" Macron said. ""It must not mean a ceasefire without guarantees. This peace must allow for Ukrainian sovereignty,"" he added.From their initial meeting, Macron has consistently challenged Trump's tendency to use dominating handshakes as a means of unsettling other world leaders.Their most notable handshake occurred during their first encounter in Brussels in 2017, when both began their presidential terms. The younger Macron, visibly straining, held Trump's hand firmly until the US president had to release his grip twice, reported new agency AFP.The intensity of Macron's grip left visible white marks on Trump's hands. Their theatrical displays continued into 2018, when Trump led Macron into the Oval Office whilst holding his hand.However, Macron's diplomatic efforts failed to convince Trump to maintain commitments to the Paris climate agreement and Iran nuclear deal.Their relationship diminished during Trump's absence, but Macron quickly re-engaged following his re-election in November 2024.Trump welcomed the invitation to attend Notre-Dame cathedral's reopening in December, marking his early return to international events. They shared another forceful handshake lasting 17 seconds.","French President Emmanuel Macron and US President Donald Trump exchanged hugs, handshakes, and backslaps during their meeting.

"No passengers, no planes: China-funded $240m Gwadar airport sits idle",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/no-passengers-no-planes-china-funded-240m-gwadar-airport-sits-idle/articleshow/118512631.cms,"Gwadar airport in Pakistan (Pic credit: AP)

With no passengers and no planes, Pakistan's newest and most expensive airport is a bit of a mystery. Entirely financed by China to the tune of $240 million, it's anyone's guess when New Gwadar International Airport will open for business. Located in the coastal city of Gwadar and completed in Oct 2024, its a stark contrast to the impoverished, restive southwestern Balochistan province around it.For the past decade, China has poured money into Balochistan and Gwadar as part of a multibillion dollar project that connects its western Xinjiang province with Arabian Sea, called the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor or CPEC.Authorities have hailed it as transformational but there's scant evidence of change in Gwadar. The city isn't connected to the national grid - electricity comes from Iran or solar panels - and there isn't enough clean water. An airport with a 400,000 passenger capacity isn't a priority for the city's 90,000 people.""This airport is not for Pakistan or Gwadar,"" said Azeem Khalid, an international relations expert who specialises in Pakistan-China ties. ""It is for China, so they can have secure access for their citizens to Gwadar and Balochistan.""CPEC has catalysed a decadeslong insurgency in resource-rich and strategically located Balochistan. Separatists, aggrieved by what they say is state exploitation at the expense of locals, are fighting for independence - targeting Pakistani troops and Chinese workers in the province and elsewhere. Members of Pakistan's ethnic Baloch minority say they face discrimination by govt and are denied opportunities available elsewhere in the country, charges govt denies.Pakistan, keen to protect China's investments, has stepped up its military footprint in Gwadar to combat dissent. The city is a jumble of checkpoints, barbed wire, troops, barricades, and watchtowers. Roads close at any given time, several days a week, to permit the safe passage of Chinese workers and Pakistani VIPs.Intelligence officers monitor journalists visiting Gwadar. Its fish market is deemed too sensitive for coverage.Many locals are frazzled. ""Nobody used to ask where we are going, what we are doing, and what is your name,"" said Khuda Bakhsh Hashim, 76. ""We used to enjoy all-night picnics in the mountains or rural areas. We are residents. Those who ask should identify themselves as to who they are.""Hashim recalled when Gwadar was part of Oman, not Pakistan, and was a stop for passenger ships heading to Mumbai. People didn't go hungry and found work easily, he said.But Gwadar's water has dried up because of drought and unchecked exploitation. So has the work. Govt says CPEC has created some 2,000 local jobs but it's not clear whom they mean by ""local"" - Baloch residents or Pakistanis from elsewhere in the country. Authorities did not elaborate.There is a perception Gwadar is dangerous or difficult to visit - only one commercial route operates out of its domestic airport, three times a week to Karachi, Pakistan's largest city. There are no direct flights to Balochistan's provincial capital of Quetta, or national capital of Islamabad.Security concerns delayed the inauguration of the international airport. There were fears the area's mountains - and their proximity to the airport - could be the ideal launchpad for an attack. Instead, PM Shehbaz Sharif and his Chinese counterpart Li Qiang hosted a virtual ceremony. The inaugural flight was off limits to media and public.","Gwadar is Pakistan's newest and most expensive airport. Entirely financed by China to the tune of $240 million.

ISLAMABAD: A mob enraged by a local’s murder over a trivial parking dispute snatched the suspect, a watchman, from police and lynched him in the mountainous Galiyat region of Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Sunday. Several police officers were wounded in the violence in a neighbourhood under the jurisdiction of Changla Gali police station, around 80km from Islamabad.Police said Imran Abbasi, a local, had parked his car in the designated area of a housing society and left for home. When he returned the next day, he got into a fight with the watchman, Khan Zaman, who allegedly stabbed him to death and wounded his brother.As word spread about the murder, a mob milled in the area and burned down five houses in the residential society.Police apprehended the culprit, who was hiding in the basement of a building, and were about to take him away when the mob swooped on him and beat him to death with sticks and stones.Lynchings are common in Pakistan and several instances of mob violence have taken place in the past decade. Many people have been lynched for alleged blasphemy, while mobs have also murdered suspects in street crimes.In June 2024, a suspected robber was lynched by a mob in the southern port city of Karachi. The suspect, armed with a pistol, had attempted to rob a citizen, who put up resistance and was joined by others standing nearby. The mob got hold of the suspect and hit him with blunt weapons, resulting in his death on the spot.In May 2024, another mob lynched a suspected robber in Karachi's Orangi town while police saved his accomplice from being killed.The same month, police rescued a Christian man from angry people, who wanted to lynch him and attacked the homes of other minority members in Punjab’s Sargodha district on charges of alleged blasphemy. Workers at a Sialkot garment factory tortured and burned to death their Sri Lankan general manager in 2023 for alleged blasphemy.","Imran Abbasi, a local, had parked his car in the designated area of a housing society and left for home.

Militancy in Balochistan



Airport inauguration delayed due to security concerns



Pakistan’s newest airport in Gwadar, fully funded by China at a cost of $240 million, remains unused months after its completion in October 2024.Spread over 4,300 acres of land. the airport is Pakistan's largest international airport and was officially opened on January 20 this year. Work started on Gwadar airport in 2019.The Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) PK 503 aircraft was the first commercial flight to arrive at the new airport after its inauguration carrying commercial passengers and high-ranking officials.However, the airport, designed to handle 400,000 passengers annually, has no scheduled flights.The New Gwadar International Airport is part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ), a multi-billion dollar project aimed at linking China’s Xinjiang province with the Arabian Sea. While officials have called it a major development, many in Gwadar say they see little benefit.Gwadar, located in Pakistan's Balochistan province , lacks basic infrastructure such as a stable electricity supply and clean water.""This airport is not for Pakistan or Gwadar,"" Azeem Khalid, an expert in Pakistan-China relations was quoted as saying by the news agency Associated Press (AP). ""It is for China, so they can have secure access for their citizens to Gwadar and Balochistan.""The airport’s construction comes amid ongoing security challenges in Balochistan. Separatist groups in the province oppose what they call exploitation of local resources, targeting both Pakistani security forces and Chinese workers.Pakistan has increased its military presence in Gwadar to protect Chinese investments, leading to more checkpoints and restrictions on movement. Roads are often closed to ensure the safety of Chinese workers and high-ranking officials.""Nobody used to ask where we are going, what we are doing, and what is your name,"" 76-year-old Gwadar resident Khuda Bakhsh Hashim was quoted as saying by the AP. ""We are asked to prove our identity, who we are, where we have come from. We are residents. Those who ask should identify themselves as to who they are.""Authorities claim CPEC has created 2,000 jobs, but there is no clarity on whether these positions were given to local Baloch residents or people from other parts of Pakistan.Gwadar remains largely disconnected, with only one commercial flight route operating three times a week to Karachi. There are no direct flights to Quetta, the provincial capital, or Islamabad.Militancy in Balochistan has increased in recent years, with attacks rising after 2021. Groups such as the Baloch Liberation Army have carried out multiple attacks, particularly after the Pakistani Taliban ended a ceasefire in 2022.Earlier, the airport’s opening was postponed due to security risks. Authorities feared that nearby mountains could be used to launch attacks. Instead, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chinese Premier Li Qiang held a virtual inauguration. The first flight landed without media or public presence.Abdul Ghafoor Hoth, a local leader from the Balochistan Awami Party, said no local residents were hired to work at the airport.""Not a single resident of Gwadar was hired to work at the airport, not even as a watchman,"" he was quoted by AP.Hoth had led protests in December demanding better living conditions in Gwadar. The demonstrations lasted 47 days before authorities promised to address local concerns, including improved access to water and electricity. Since then, no progress has been made on these commitments.","Gwadar airport is Pakistan's largest international airport and was officially opened on January 20 this year.

Two police personnel and four militants were killed in an attack on a police check post in Pakistan’s southwestern Balochistan province on Friday.The attack came two days after the separatist Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed the killing of seven passengers, who hailed from Pakistan’s Punjab province, on a highway in the restive province.In the latest incident, police said that armed men stormed a police check post in Shaban area, some 35 km from the provincial capital Quetta, early on Friday morning, “killing two policemen and injuring two others”, local police station in-charge Munir Khan said.“The police force retaliated and killed four attackers,” Khan said, adding, “Search and clearance operations continued in the area as some terrorists fled to the nearby mountains.”Pakistan has been struggling to quell separatist attacks in Balochistan, which shares a porous border with Iran and Afghanistan.According to official figures, around 40 attacks against police in Balochistan in 2024 killed at least 25 police officers and injured 61 others. Last month, dozens of fighters of the separatist outfit wrested control of a small town in Khuzdar from paramilitary forces. Pakistani authorities regained the town after hours of effort.The separatists accuse Pakistan’s federal govt and military authorities of exploiting the natural resources of mineral-rich Balochistan for development elsewhere in the country, while neglecting the local population. The province has been the site of an insurgency for the last two decades, with separatists frequently attacking police, security forces, and civilians they see as “outsiders” in the region.
