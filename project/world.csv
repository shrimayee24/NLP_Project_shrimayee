AGRA: A court in Mainpuri Wednesday sentenced a 60-year-old woman to life imprisonment for killing her daughter-in-law by setting her on fire over additional dowry demands in 2022.

You both must make an effort to restore ties: SC to couple

NEW DELHI: In a joint family, a man giving more importance to his mother than his wife is often a trigger for discord. But for amicable resolution of disputes, the apex court Friday advised one such man to hear out his wife's view and respect her sentiments too.Though the couple in question, now living separately, hinted that there was no possibility of their living together, a bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and K V Viswanathan asked them to sort out their differences through mediation and give a fresh try to their relationship for the sake of their two children - a minor son living with his mother and an elder daughter living with her grandmother as the father is in the US.""Take back your wife and children. Be a responsible father. Both of you must make an effort to restore your relationship,"" the bench told the couple, both of whom were present in court through video conferencing.As the woman and her husband kept blaming each other - the man alleging that a false criminal case was lodged against him and the woman claiming that she was not being taken care of - the bench said they should focus on the interests of the children instead of fighting it out.When the man kept referring to his mother during the hearing, Justice Nagarathna hinted that many family disputes arose when the wife is not given her due importance.""Mother's words are considered weightier than wife's and that creates a problem. Grow up. We are not telling you to keep your mother aside but talk to your wife also,"" the bench told the manAs the husband submitted that he had not seen his son even once since the child was living with his mom, the court immediately asked her to bring the child in front of the camera but she said that he had gone to school. The court then directed her to show the child to his father during mediation. ""Imagine a child who had not seen his father and sister. Do not do this.

KOTA/JAIPUR: Seven children were killed and at least 21 injured when a classroom ceiling collapsed on them at Piplodi Govt Upper Primary School in Rajasthan's Jhalawar district on Friday morning, moments after a teacher who had been alerted to ""falling brick pieces"" allegedly asked them to ""sit quietly"". Ten of the injured students were hospitalised in a critical condition, officials said.Principal Meena Garg and four teachers were suspended for alleged negligence pending a high-level probe while school education minister Madan Dilawar owned moral responsibility for the tragedy.""I won't engage in a blame game. Being the education minister, I am responsible for this... We will conduct a fair investigation and strict action will be taken against those found guilty. We allocated funds for the maintenance of 2,000 dilapidated govt schools in phases,"" Dilawar said.He announced Rs 10 lakh in ex gratia and a contractual govt job for one family member of each of the victims.Outrage over the ceiling collapse triggered violence in Jhalawar later in the day, prompting police to baton charge groups of protesters blocking roads and pelting them with stones at Guradi Circle and outside SRG Hospital.The victims, between 10 and 15, were among 31 students of different classes inside the classroom when cracks in the ceiling suspected to have been caused by rainwater seepage purportedly opened up before their eyes. ""We told sir that pieces of the ceiling were falling on us but he ignored it,"" said a teary-eyed girl.Within seconds, screams of children drowned in the noise of brick and mortar coming down in a heap. Villagers who had sprinted towards the school compound on seeing clouds of dust spiralling into the air were the first rescuers, sources said.Witnesses said parents frantically searched for their children in the mounds of debris. ""At least 13 kids were pulled out within 20 minutes of the ceiling collapse,"" said village sarpanch Ram Prasad Lodha, who drove his payloader to the site to assist in the rescue.Lodha alleged that an ambulance reached the village 45 minutes after being informed of the accident. Most of the injured students were taken to hospital on motorcycles, he said.While the education minister's office said 21 students were injured, Jhalawar district education officer Narso Meena's official report mentions injuries to 24 people.Preliminary reports suggested the students had been made to wait in their classrooms instead of going to the ground for morning prayers, as usual, because it was raining at the time. The classroom's rear wall collapsed first, causing the roof to fall on the students.The classroom whose ceiling collapsed was one of two built in 1994 with funds from the gram panchayat. ""Funds were released recently for repairs. We aren't sure if the rooms built by the gram panchayat were renovated or not,"" said an official.Collector Rathore said district administration recently instructed education department to draw up a list of dilapidated school buildings. Piplodi Govt Upper Primary School, whose building is three decades old, didn't figure in that list, he said.Education secretary Krishna Kunal said the school's roof had been repaired in 2023. ""If a little caution were exercised, such a tragedy wouldn't have occurred. We are appealing not only to teachers but also to parents and village representatives that children should not be sent to schools with dilapidated rooms.""","Rains had forced kids to remain indoors at Piplodi Govt Upper Primary School in Rajasthan's Jhalawar district.

PM Modi is expected to speak in both the Houses.

3. Did Joy Taylor comment directly on Donald Trump?



Just days after her departure from Fox Sports, Joy Taylor stirred public debate by weighing in on reports linking Donald Trump to Jeffrey Epstein ’s files. Her pointed social media post signaled a bold return to the spotlight, suggesting she’s no longer holding back when it comes to political commentary.On July 24, Joy Taylor reposted a story from Complex on her Instagram Stories revealing that Donald Trump had reportedly been notified by the Justice Department that his name appears in documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, the late convicted sex offender. Alongside the post, Taylor wrote a biting caption: “Water is wet.”The cryptic remark quickly caught fire online, with many interpreting it as a sarcastic confirmation that Trump’s name showing up in such files was unsurprising — or perhaps long suspected. While Taylor didn’t expand on her message, her decision to comment so soon after her Fox Sports departure suggests she’s no longer interested in playing it safe in the public sphere.Taylor’s social media moment arrives amid lingering questions surrounding her firing from FS1, where she co-hosted Speak with Keyshawn Johnson and Paul Pierce. Her name was recently included in a January sexual misconduct and discrimination lawsuit filed by former FS1 hairstylist Noushin Faraji.The suit also named Skip Bayless and former executive Charlie Dixon, accusing Taylor of downplaying a groping allegation and mocking PTSD symptoms.Taylor has denied the accusations outright, calling them “meritless and attention-seeking.” However, internal reviews reportedly uncovered additional concerns behind the scenes. Former FS1 host Cris Carter commented on the matter during a podcast appearance, saying, “They had to tear all those shows down… That thing was ugly… Had to happen.”Meanwhile, the Trump-Epstein connection continues to make headlines. A report from The Wall Street Journal claims that Attorney General Pam Bondi informed Trump during a May briefing that his name had surfaced in DOJ files related to Epstein. The White House has dismissed the reports as “fake news,” insisting that appearing in documents does not imply wrongdoing.Still, Joy Taylor’s post suggests public figures are no longer willing to stay quiet — especially when they feel uncensored.Also Read: Joy Taylor’s FOX Sports scandal: Everything about the backstage drama, show cancellations, and lawsuit that led to her exit She posted a controversial reaction to reports linking Donald Trump to Jeffrey Epstein, sparking political backlash.Taylor was named in a sexual misconduct and discrimination lawsuit, prompting a major shakeup at FS1.Yes, she shared a cryptic post seemingly mocking the resurfaced Epstein allegations involving Trump.","Joy Taylor shared a cryptic post seemingly mocking the resurfaced Epstein allegations involving Donald Trump.

KANNUR: Govindachamy alias Charley Thomas, convicted of rape and murder of a 23-year-old woman in 2011, escaped from the high-security block of the Kannur Central Prison early on Friday. The 41-year-old life convict, whose left hand is amputated, was apprehended by police within hours. He was found hiding inside a well on the premises of National Sample Survey Office at Thalap, police said.Kannur city police commissioner P Nithin Raj said the jailbreak occurred between 4.15 and 6.30am. Jail authorities discovered his absence during a morning inspection, after assistant prison officer trainees, who were out training, found clothes hanging from the prison wall along the national highway.Govindachamy had cut through the iron bars of his cell using a bar cutter and fashioned a rope out of cloth and bedsheets, police said.Jail officials are clueless on how he managed to scale the prison wall without assistance. The six-metre wall of the prison is topped with an electric fence, which is believed to have been non-functional at the time. Three prison officers on duty at the time have been suspended following a preliminary inquiry that found lapses on their part.Police launched a statewide manhunt soon after, and apprehended Govindachamy following a tip-off from a local resident, Vinoj, who spotted him in Thalap in the morning. ""I was riding my two-wheeler when I noticed a man walking slowly on the left side of the road. He looked like a beggar, and we exchanged glances briefly. I had already heard about Govindachamy's escape from prison, and something about the man I saw made me suspicious. .. When I called out his name, he immediately bolted into a narrow lane and jumped over the compound wall of an under-construction building,"" Vinoj said.Police later confirmed his identity after reviewing CCTV footage from the area. Based on this, a large contingent of officers, along with residents, intensified the search. A dog squad was also deployed. M Unnikrishnan, a NSSO staffer, spotted the convict in the well while inspecting the premises. Police, assisted by residents, apprehended Govindachamy.He was then taken to the Kannur town station and, after a medical examination, brought to the central prison for evidence collection. He was produced before the Kannur judicial first class magistrate court and remanded in custody for 14 days. He is likely to be shifted to the Viyyur high-security prison in Thrissur.Govindachamy is a native of Virudhachalam in Tamil Nadu. The 2011 case had shocked the nation and sparked a debate over women's safety on public transport. The victim, who was travelling alone on a passenger train from Ernakulam to Shoranur, was pushed out of the moving train and raped on the railway track. She later succumbed to her injuries at a hospital.","Govindachamy, 41, was found hiding inside a well on the premises of National Sample Survey Office at Thalap.

Taylor Swift reportedly “cut” Blake Lively from Selena Gomez’s birthday guest list

Travis Kelce stands by Taylor Swift as her inner circle gets smaller — and more curated

FAQs

1. Why was Blake Lively absent from Selena Gomez’s birthday party?

2. What caused the tension between Taylor Swift and Blake Lively?

3. Was Travis Kelce involved in the situation?

In the ever-evolving web of celebrity friendships, Taylor Swift appears to be making bold choices about who gets to stay in her close circle — and who doesn’t. The latest drama? According to a report from #ShuterScoop, Swift may have been behind Blake Lively’s noticeable absence from Selena Gomez’s glitter-filled birthday party. And while the alleged fallout continues to spark headlines, Swift’s boyfriend, Travis Kelce, reportedly stood by her side during the festivities.A source told #ShuterScoop that Blake Lively was “deliberately cut from the guest list” for Gomez’s 33rd birthday bash — and the reason points directly to Taylor Swift. The insider added that Lively’s ongoing legal drama with her It Ends With Us co-star Justin Baldoni may have become too toxic for Swift to tolerate. The source claimed Gomez simply wanted “love, light, and platform boots” — not “subpoenas and side-eyes” — at her party.That legal entanglement seems to have chilled what was once a beloved Hollywood friendship. While Swift and Lively were often seen together in past years — including red carpets, Met Galas, and girls' nights out — they haven’t been publicly photographed together in months. Lively’s notable absence from the party, and now from Swift’s inner circle, only adds fuel to the speculation.Amid all the noise, Travis Kelce was reportedly enjoying the celebration alongside Swift. While not confirmed by photos, insiders claim the NFL star is very much in the singer’s corner as she redefines her inner circle. Kelce has remained largely silent on Swift’s public feuds, but those close to him say he’s “fully supportive” of her choices — including who she decides to keep close.As Selena Gomez shared joyful, disco-themed photos with Taylor Swift and others from the bash, one face was clearly missing: Blake Lively’s.

JAIPUR: A day after he was detained for allegedly killing his 1.8-year-old son, Jaipur (Rural) police Friday arrested Lalit Saini (35), after the toddler's body was recovered from a 200-foot-deep dry borewell in Dipola ki Dhani village under Jamwa Ramgarh police station limits.Police said Saini initially misled them, claiming the child was sent to a relative's home for treatment. However, after prolonged questioning, he confessed to dumping the boy into an open borewell near his farmland late Wednesday night. To hide the act, he covered the borewell with plastic and soil.A senior officer told TOI the recovery was made with the help of teams from SDRF, NDRF, and Civil Defence after a multi-hour rescue operation. The body was sent for post-mortem to determine whether the child was alive at the time of being thrown into the borewell.The investigation began late Wednesday night after the police control room received a complaint from the child's maternal grandfather, Harphool Saini, a resident of Dausa.

$100 million missing?

US President Donald Trump has launched a scathing attack on California’s wildfire relief efforts, branding the high-profile FireAid benefit concert a “total disaster” and accusing Democrats of planning and running a scam.“‘FIREAID’ IS A TOTAL DISASTER. LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER DEMOCRAT INSPIRED SCAM. 100 MILLION DOLLARS IS MISSING. WAS SUPPOSED TO TO GO TO THE LOS ANGELES FIRE VICTIMS, FIRES THAT, WITH PROPER MANAGEMENT, WOULD NEVER HAVE EVEN HAPPENED,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.He also blamed Democrat California governor Gavin Newsom for refusing to release vital water reserves during the crisis.“GOVERNOR NEWSCUM REFUSED TO RELEASE BILLIONS OF GALLONS OF WATER FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, AND THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST. WHAT A DIFFERENCE IT WOULD HAVE MADE! I HAVE SINCE OVERRULED HIM, AND IT IS NOW RELEASED. All FEDERAL HOUSING PERMITS HAVE ALSO BEEN APPROVED, THE CITY IS YEARS LATE. GET THE FIRE VICTIMS THEIR APPROVALS TO REBUILD, AND DO IT NOW!”Trump’s remarks come amid growing scrutiny over the distribution of funds raised during the FireAid concert, which was staged across two major venues: SoFi Stadium and the Forum, in January.The event, organised by Los Angeles Clippers owner Steve Ballmer and featuring major artists such as Olivia Rodrigo, Billie Eilish, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers, brought in $100 million after Ballmer and his wife Connie matched all public donations, as per CBS news.Although many organisations praised the swift distribution of FireAid benefit funds, concerns began circulating online and on social media alleging that the donations were not reaching wildfire victims.In response to these claims, Representative Kevin Kiley (R-Rocklin) penned a letter urging the Department of Justice to investigate the matter.However, several recipient organisations have publicly defended FireAid, citing rapid distribution and tangible impact.“We received $250,000,” said Kevin McManus, spokesperson for Pasadena Humane Society. “We were able to save a lot of animals' lives in part because of that donation.”Michael Flood, CEO of the LA Regional Food Bank, said FireAid came at a crucial time when demand for food assistance surged by 30% due to the devastation caused by wildfires in the Pacific Palisades and Altadena.“It was especially high in January through March as so many people were displaced and lost power and water,” Flood told Los Angeles Times.“People had to move in with family and friends around the county. We did a food bank in Inglewood in February and we saw just how many had been displaced by both fires.”On the other hand, many individuals said that they received no funds from the event.""I have not seen any benefit from the FireAid money, and I am very involved here and neither have my neighbors,"" said David Howard, who lost two homes in Pacific Palisades told Fox news.According to the FireAid website, the concert raised an estimated $100 million intended for “direct relief.” During the event, host and actor Miles Teller assured viewers that “all the money raised will go directly to people who need it now and long-term efforts to build it back.”However, last week, the charity said that it was not possible to make direct payments.""FireAid does not have the capability to make direct payments to individuals and that was never the plan.

“It is not the critic who counts…” With those opening words from former US President Theodore Roosevelt, the White House on Friday (local time) framed Donald Trump as a battle-worn leader confronting his critics head-on. In a post on X, it quoted the former president’s famous 1910 “Man in the Arena” speech, a message often reserved for those who act decisively in the face of adversity.Shared alongside a dramatic image portraying Trump in a Roman-style arena, the quote frames him as “the man in the arena”, a leader who acts despite obstacles and criticism.The quote, taken from Roosevelt’s 1910 speech “Citizenship in a Republic” delivered at the Sorbonne in Paris, is often used to praise those who take bold decisions and face public scrutiny. The timing and tone of the post signal an effort to reframe Trump’s embattled presidency as a test of resilience, determination, and leadership under pressure.The quote, shared with an image of Trump, continues, ""The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.The quote was shared with an image of Trump walking alone through a Roman-style coliseum, a symbolic representation of the “arena.” Surrounded by towering stands, a darkened sky, and the ruins of a grand structure, Trump is shown striding forward, past a worn American flag, facing the crowd and whatever lies ahead. The imagery appeared to underline the message that the 47th president of the United States is standing firm in the midst of turmoil, criticism, and political opposition.Trump is facing a mountain of controversies, more recently of being mentioned in Epstein’s file. However, he has denied the allegations as a hoax.Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has claimed significant achievements in the first six months of his second term. Donald Trump, “who spends himself in a worthy cause,” has claimed that the first six months of his presidency have delivered significant achievements. Since returning to the White House in January as the 47th president, his second term has already brought major shifts in both domestic and foreign policy.

"New directive: Israel makes Arabic, Islam studies compulsory for all intelligence officials; here's why",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/new-directive-israel-makes-arabic-islam-studies-compulsory-for-all-intelligence-officials-heres-why/articleshow/122916012.cms,"



In a major shift, Israeli military has announced sweeping reforms to its intelligence training, making Arabic language and Islamic cultural studies compulsory for all intelligence personnel, reports Jerusalem Post.The move comes in response to the intelligence lapses that preceded the October 7, 2023, Hamas attacks.The Israel defence forces (IDF) confirmed that the changes are being led by major general Shlomi Binder, head of the IDF intelligence directorate, also known as Aman.For the first time, soldiers in technological and cyber roles will undergo training in Arabic and Islamic studies.The goal is to ensure that future commanders are fluent in Arabic and get familiar with Islamic culture.All Aman soldiers will be trained in Islamic studies by the end of next year, and half will receive Arabic language instruction, according to Jewish News Syndicate (JNS). These figures represent a significant jump from previous years.“This is part of a fundamental cultural shift within Israeli intelligence,” Israeli army radio’s Doron Kadosh reported. He said a new department will soon be created within Aman to teach Arabic and Islamic studies.Special focus will also be given to regional dialects, including those spoken in Iraq and by the Houthis in Yemen.One challenge the IDF has faced is understanding Houthi communications. According to sources cited by the Jerusalem Post, the use of qat, a mild narcotic commonly chewed in Yemen, has made speech unclear and difficult to decode. In June, an Israeli strike on a Houthi leader reportedly failed because he was attending a qat-chewing gathering.To address such issues, Aman is introducing targeted courses to train language analysts in region-specific dialects. Instructors from relevant communities have been recruited to help provide more authentic instruction.The reforms will also see the reopening of TELEM, a department that once promoted Arabic and Middle Eastern studies in Israeli schools. TELEM was shut down six years ago due to budget cuts, which led to a decline in Arabic education among students.“Until now, we haven’t been good enough in the areas of culture, language, and Islam,” a senior Aman officer told army radio. “We won’t turn our intelligence officers and soldiers into Arab kids who grew up in a village, but through language and cultural studies, we can instil in them doubt and deep observation.”","Israeli military has announced sweeping reforms to its intelligence training.

The White House's first reaction to Wednesday night's South Park premiere attacking President Donald Trump is here. Trump's White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers told Rolling Stone: ""The Left's hypocrisy truly has no end — for years they have come after South Park for what they labeled as 'offense' [sic] content, but suddenly they are praising the show.""Just like the creators of South Park, the Left has no authentic or original content, which is why their popularity continues to hit record lows. This show hasn't been relevant for over 20 years and is hanging on by a thread with uninspired ideas in a desperate attempt for attention. President Trump has delivered on more promises in just six months than any other president in our country's history — and no fourth-rate show can derail President Trump's hot streak. ""After a gap of almost two and a half years, South Park kicked off its 27th season after creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone reached a $1.5 billion streaming deal with Paramount.

'I'm all in': Alina Habba appointed acting US attorney in New Jersey; Justice Department overrules federal judges' choice,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/im-all-in-alina-habba-appointed-acting-us-attorney-in-new-jersey-justice-department-overrules-federal-judges-choice/articleshow/122897456.cms,"



Alina Habba is appointed as New Jersey’s acting US attorney, a day before her tenure as interim US attorney was set to expire on Friday.Habba made the announcement via social media that she would remain at the helm. The announcement follows the Trump administration’s decision to withdraw her nomination for the permanent role, a legal technicality that now allows her to serve as acting US attorney for up to 210 more days.A spokesperson for the Justice Department confirmed the move, while the White House reiterated President Trump’s full backing for Habba. ""President Trump continues to have full confidence in Alina Habba and her commitment to serve the people of New Jersey,"" said White House spokesperson Harrison Fields.The decision ends a tense standoff between Washington officials and federal judges in New Jersey, which had raised confusion within the office about who was legally in charge. Earlier this week, the judges had selected their own candidate, experienced federal prosecutor Desiree Leigh Grace. But shortly after, the justice department fired Grace, accusing the judges of acting politically and reaffirming support for Habba.Grace, widely respected within the justice department, had posted her willingness to serve, calling it the “greatest honor” to be chosen on merit. However, Habba’s statement the next day left little doubt about who would lead the office.“I don’t cower to pressure. I don’t answer to politics. This is a fight for justice. And I’m all in,” Habba wrote on Thursday.She followed up with a message to staff, “There has been enough noise the past four months.”“Let’s keep our focus and get back to the important work ahead for the District of New Jersey,” the New York Times cited Habba.Habba, a former personal lawyer to Donald Trump , has no prior prosecutorial experience. Since taking the role in March, she has drawn national attention for launching investigations into prominent Democrats and declaring her ambition to help ""turn New Jersey red,"" a stance that has raised eyebrows given the traditionally nonpartisan nature of the post.In a further twist, a Justice Department spokesperson confirmed that Habba resigned briefly on Thursday from the interim role and was reclassified as first assistant, a position that previously belonged to Grace, whom Habba herself had appointed as deputy earlier this year.Grace, a Republican and the first in her family to attend university, made her name as a federal prosecutor tackling gang violence. Her work, including high-profile MS-13 convictions, earned her recognition within the Justice Department. Legal peers, such as Robert Scrivo, praised her dedication and effectiveness. “I don't know that anyone did it at a higher level,” Scrivo said, as quoted by New York Times.Despite recent events, Habba had publicly acknowledged Grace’s contributions, telling colleagues in May that appointing her deputy had been the best decision of her tenure, a comment met with applause.",Alina Habba is appointed as New Jersey's acting US attorney. Habba's tenure as interim US attorney was set to expire on Friday. The White House reiterated President Trump's full backing for Habba.

'Murderers, Rapists Welcomed': Trump Ally Ted Cruz Torches Dems, Biden Over 'Criminal Aliens'





Former President Joe Biden has secured a deal with Little, Brown & Co. to pen a memoir about his White House tenure. Industry executives revealed that the untitled book, acquired through an auction by the Hachette imprint, garnered a £10 million advance, as initially reported by The Wall Street Journal.President Biden hinted that his memoir will cover his four years as President, according to NY Post.Diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer in May, the 82-year-old Biden has discussed the project at various public gatherings, expressing urgency to complete it amidst his health challenges. At a San Diego event, he stated that he was ""working like hell with a publisher"" to research and expedite a memoir focusing on his presidential period.While former presidents traditionally publish accounts of their time in office, Biden's memoir offers an opportunity to address concerns about his physical and mental capabilities, alongside presenting his presidential narrative.At an event earlier this month, Biden said that he was “working my tail off” to write a memoir. He was represented by Creative Artists Agency, which sold the worldwide rights for the book to Hachette.The agency also represented Biden for his 2017 memoir “Promise Me, Dad: A Year of Hope, Hardship and Purpose,” which chronicled his final year with his eldest son, Beau, who died from brain cancer in 2015.Having achieved his long-held presidential ambition, Biden became the oldest incumbent upon his January 2020 inauguration. He later withdrew from the 2024 electoral race amid growing concerns about his capacity to serve.Subsequently, discussions have centred on whether his close associates and party overlooked his apparent decline.Also read: Hillary Clinton flagged concerns on Biden's 'viability' before re-election bid; ex-NSA Jake Sullivan also approached Ron Klain Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson's ""Original Sin"", a significant non-fiction release this year, examines how Biden's protective inner circle disregarded his fragility, potentially compromising Democratic electoral prospects. The book achieved considerable success, with nearly 100,000 print copies sold according to Circana BookScan. Conservative publishers have responded with publications focusing on controversies surrounding his son Hunter.Presidential memoirs typically command eight-figure advances, valued for prestige as much as sales potential. Biden's memoir, however, is considerably valued lower than his peers. Barack and Michelle Obama notably secured approximately £60 million from Penguin Random House in 2017.Both Obama books achieved remarkable success: ""A Promised Land"" exceeded 2.8 million hardcover sales, while ""Becoming"" surpassed 5 million print copies, per Circana BookScan. Bill Clinton's 2004 ""My Life"" and George W. Bush's ""Decision Points"" also achieved significant commercial success with substantial advances.However, the political non-fiction market has evolved, becoming increasingly divided. Recent publications analysing the 2024 election have struggled to attract broad readership.Biden's 2017 publication ""Promise Me, Dad"", chronicling his son Beau's death from brain cancer, balanced political content with personal loss and achieved bestseller status. Other Biden family members, including his sister Valerie Biden Owens and son Hunter, have published memoirs. Jill Biden authored a 2019 memoir about their family life and several children's books.","Former President Joe Biden has secured a deal with Little, Brown & Co. to pen a memoir about his White House tenure.

Epstein case: Ex-girlfriend Maxwell allegedly granted limited immunity; grilled by top DOJ official,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/epstein-case-ex-girlfriend-maxwell-allegedly-granted-limited-immunity-grilled-by-top-doj-official/articleshow/122915380.cms,"Will Trump Free Ghislaine Maxwell? His Cryptic Response Sparks Frenzy | WATCH





Ghislaine Maxwell was granted a limited form of immunity, during her 9 hour interrogation lasting two days, by deputy attorney general Todd Blanche, as per sources cited by ABC news.The immunity deal, known as proffer immunity, meant Maxwell could answer questions without the risk of her responses being used against her later, according to the sources. This type of immunity is typically offered to individuals prosecutors may want to turn into cooperators in ongoing criminal investigations.Maxwell, former girlfriend of infamous Jeffery Epstein, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for trafficking underage girls, has already been tried, convicted and sentenced.The first meeting, which took place on Thursday at the federal courthouse in Tallahassee, Florida, lasted six hours. A second meeting the next day ran for about three hours. Her attorney, David Markus, confirmed to ABC News that Maxwell had initiated the meetings with the DOJ and was questioned about “maybe 100 different people”.“She didn’t hold anything back,” Markus told ABC news. “There have been no asks and no promises.”Markus declined to name the individuals Maxwell was questioned about or confirm whether she provided information about others who may have committed crimes. “We haven’t asked for anything. This is not a situation where we are asking for anything in return for testimony or anything like that,” he added on Friday. “Of course, everybody knows Ms Maxwell would welcome any relief.”Blanche did not address reporters upon arrival at the courthouse, but stated on social media that he would disclose what he learned from Maxwell “at the appropriate time.”Maxwell is currently appealing her conviction in relation to her involvement with the deceased financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein . Markus said of the initial Thursday session, “We don’t want to get into the substance of the questions.”“There were a lot of questions and we went all day and she answered every one of them. She never said ‘I’m not going to answer,’ never declined.”It is rare for someone convicted of sex trafficking to meet with a justice department official of Blanche’s rank. Blanche, notably, once served as President Donald Trump’s lead criminal defence attorney.When ABC White House Correspondent Mary Bruce asked Trump on Friday whether clemency for Maxwell was being considered, he replied, “I can’t talk about that now because, you know, it’s a very sensitive interview going on.” Trump went on to describe Blanche as a “great attorney” and said, “I don’t know exactly what’s happening. But I certainly can’t talk about pardons.”Asked whether Maxwell could be trusted to tell the truth in her DOJ interviews, Trump said, “Well, he’s a professional lawyer. He’s been through things like this before,” referring to Blanche.Annie Farmer, one of the women who testified against Maxwell at trial, expressed disappointment over the meetings. “It’s very disappointing that these things are happening behind closed doors without any input from the people that the government asked to come forward and speak against her in order to put her away,” she said. “There were so many young girls and women that were harmed by her.”Maxwell’s lawyer said she had been treated poorly over the past five years and welcomed the chance to speak with Blanche as she continues to appeal her conviction.Blanche’s meetings with Maxwell come as the justice department faces increasing pressure from Senate Republicans to release more details about Epstein’s activities and his connections with high-profile figures.","Ghislaine Maxwell was granted a limited form of immunity, during her 9 hour interrogation lasting two days, by deputy attorney general Todd Blanche.

BREAKING: Trump Blasts Reporters To Their Faces For 'Making A Very Big Thing' About Epstein Files





US president Donald Trump on Friday said he was never informed that his name appeared in files related to Jeffrey Epstein , the late sex offender.Speaking to reporters in Scotland, Trump denied a report by The Wall Street Journal which claimed that the attorney general had briefed him in May. “No, I was never, never briefed, no,” he said.When asked about Ghislaine Maxwell ’s recent interview, Trump avoided details. “I have nothing to say about it. She is being talked to by a really smart man. I don’t know anything about the conversation,” he said. On the subject of a possible pardon for Maxwell, Trump dismissed it. “A lot of people have been asking about pardon. This is not the time to be talking about pardon,” he said.Trump reiterated what he told reporters before flying to Scotland. “You’re making a very big thing about something that’s not a big thing. You should be talking about former president Bill Clinton, former Harvard president, hedge fund guys, not talking about Trump,” he added. He earlier told reporters, ""I'll give you the list. These guys lived with Jeffrey.”The WSJ report claimed Bondi and her deputy Todd Blanche conveyed to Trump that he was mentioned several times on the documents.Bondi and Blanche issued a joint statement after Journal's report and said they routinely briefed Trumpo about the findings.The Wall Street Journal report came after Trump sued Rupert Murdoch and WSJ after it claimed that Trump wrote a birthday letter to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and that note was not in good taste.

From predator to victim: Major backlash as Trump admin engages with Maxwell

After two days of questioning led by deputy attorney general Todd Blanche, it was revealed that Ghislaine Maxwell , the aide of Jeffrey Epstein , answered all questions of the Justice Department and gave information about 100 different people linked to the late pedophile. Maxwell's lawyer David Oscar said that she was asked about every possible thing.“This was the first opportunity she’s ever been given to answer questions about what happened,” Markus added. “The truth will come out about what happened with Mr. Epstein and she’s the person who’s answering those questions.”A major backlash started as Trump sent his lawyer to speak to Maxwell as it seems pretty evident now that Trump will pardon Maxwell. Social media users pointed out that the narrative has already changed and Ghislaine who was no less evil than Epstein, according to their victims, is now being portrayed as a victim herself.As Trump was asked about whether he would pardon Maxwell, he said he has the right to do that but he did not give it a thought. “It’s something I haven’t thought about. I’m allowed to do it, but I haven’t thought about it.”“I don’t want to talk about that,"" he said.In his latest statement on Epstein, Trump said he never went to Epstein's island but Bill Clinton visited the island 28 times.Virginia Giuffre, one of the victims of Epstein's sex trafficking, who died earlier this year, said Maxwell's crimes were even worse because she used to gain the girls' confidence to drag them into the trafficking. Giuffre said Maxwell gained her confidence by promising that she would help her fulfil her dream of becoming a massage therapist if she worked for Epstein.","Ghislaine Maxwell gave information about 100 people associated with Epstein to the DOJ in two-day interview.

A grieving couple from Philadelphia has filed a lawsuit against two funeral homes, one in Pennsylvania and another in Georgia alleging they say they were handed their son’s brain in a leaking, unmarked box.Their son, 56-year-old Timothy Garlington, died in Georgia on 15 November 2023. Though he was from Philadelphia, he had been living in Georgia at the time. The Butlers hired both funeral homes to handle his final arrangements.According to the lawsuit, Garlington’s body was moved to Nix & Nix Funeral Homes in Philadelphia five days later. When the Butlers later collected their son’s belongings, they were handed a white, unmarked box. In the car, the box began to smell and leak fluid. Inside, they say, was their son’s brain.“It was and it is still in my heart,” Lawrence Butler said tearfully during a press briefing. “I smelled death in my car. I had to get rid of that car.

Chuck E. Cheese mascot arrested in full costume for credit card fraud





A Chuck E Cheese mascot in Florida was arrested mid-shift for allegedly using a stolen credit card, stunning customers who witnessed the unusual scene unfold.Jermel Jones, 41, was in full mouse costume entertaining families at the Tallahassee outlet on Sharer Road on Wednesday evening when police walked in and addressed him by character name. “Chuck E, come with me,” Officer Jarrett Cruz recalled saying in his report. Jones resisted briefly but was eventually handcuffed with “minor physical effort,” police said, according to NBC news.The case began weeks earlier when Michelle Allen visited the restaurant for her child’s birthday party on 28 June. She later found multiple suspicious transactions on her credit card at stores she didn’t recognise. Allen retrieved CCTV footage from one of those stores and spotted the same Chuck E. Cheese employee using her card.When Officer Cruz returned to the restaurant to investigate, he couldn’t find Jones in the staff area. But the mouse mascot had appeared on the floor and a colleague quietly confirmed Jones was inside the costume.Despite insisting, “I don’t use nobody’s cards but my own,” police said they found Allen’s Visa card in Jones’ pocket, along with a smoke shop receipt tied to a fraudulent charge. He was arrested for larceny, unlawful possession of ID, and fraudulent card use.Jones posted a $6,500 bond and was released from Leon County Jail on Thursday. Chuck E.

ISLAMABAD: As jailed former PM Imran Khan completes two years in prison, his sons – Sulaiman and Qasim – have stepped into the political spotlight, launching an aggressive lobbying campaign in the United States to press for their father’s release just days before Khan’s call for a nationwide protest on Aug 5, which has put the state on edge.Khan, arrested on Aug 5, 2023, remains behind bars despite some convictions being overturned. He is currently serving time in three major cases that his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), claims are part of a broader effort to keep him out of politics.He was convicted in the Toshakhana case, involving the illegal sale of state gifts received during his premiership. He was sentenced in the cipher case, accused of leaking classified diplomatic correspondence for political gain. And in the Al-Qadir Trust case, Khan and his wife were held liable for controversial land deals linked to a charitable trust.PTI has consistently maintained that the charges are politically motivated, aimed at “eliminating the most popular leader” in the country.Now, with most of PTI’s senior leadership jailed, exiled, or forced to resign, Khan’s sons have taken the international route. Based in the UK, the brothers have held meetings in Washington DC with US lawmakers, policy groups and human rights organisations, and are reportedly preparing to testify before congressional panels.Their message: Imran Khan is being held in solitary confinement in inhumane conditions, denied light, medical access, and family contact.The campaign has triggered speculation about whether the two sons might return to Pakistan, possibly to appear at the planned protest. While PTI has not confirmed this, party insiders say their presence could act as a powerful morale boost for the party’s dispersed support base.Meanwhile, the state has moved swiftly to neutralise any protest momentum. On July 22, an anti-terror court in Lahore sentenced eight senior PTI leaders, including Dr Yasmin Rashid, to 10 years in prison for their alleged role in the May 9 riots, when military installations were targeted after Khan’s initial arrest. Observers see the convictions as a tactical strike to undercut mobilisation ahead of the Aug 5 protest. The verdicts have raised concerns among legal experts about the selective use of terrorism laws against political opponents.From prison, Khan has issued a call for unity among PTI ranks, urging supporters to “shun differences” and prepare for what he called a decisive moment for Pakistan’s democracy. But the party remains fractured and leaderless, with ongoing rifts between loyalists and factions seen as open to negotiations with the establishment.At the heart of the political storm is the army chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir, who was controversially elevated to five-star rank in May. PTI blames him, along with PML-N and PPP leaders, for orchestrating what it calls a civil-military clampdown to sideline Khan and crush dissent.In a recent prison note, Khan mocked Munir as the “King of the Jungle”, accusing him of ruling the country through “fear, not law”.","Sulaiman and Qasim Khan have launched an aggressive lobbying campaign in the United States to press for their father’s release.

'Broken system, easy to manipulate'







A visa fraud network is being run by some Pakistani consultants who are exploiting loopholes in the UK immigration system, with one firm claiming a “98% success” rate for entry, according to a report by The Telegraph.The investigation found that forged documents, including fake CVs, employment letters, and bank statements, were being sold for up to £50,000 to secure work and student visas. These materials, riddled with basic errors, were being waved through by the UK home office, enabling illegal but technically “legal” entry into Britain.The report revealed that a widespread visa fraud operation targeting Britain’s immigration system, orchestrated by Pakistani consultants, with one guarantying entry into the UK with ""98% success"".""Syed Kamran Haider, the chief executive of Mirpur Visa Consultant (MVC) in the Pakistan-administered region of Kashmir, was found to be operating openly online, where he advertises loopholes in the UK asylum system, which experts described as 'easy to manipulate',"" the report said.MVC was charging thousands of pounds to fabricate documents such as fake CVs and bank statements for visa applicants. These falsified materials were used to meet UK immigration criteria.One such forged application, including a bogus employment letter from a non-existent hospital riddled with grammatical errors, was successfully used to secure a UK work visa, it said.UK-based immigration lawyer Harjap Bhangal blamed the nation's ""broken system"" which was ""easy to manipulate"".“If you claim asylum before that visa runs out, you can still work. The Home Office is a broken institution... They are not realising where the loopholes are [and] what is being done, what migrants are doing,” The Telegraph quoted him as saying.“These visa ‘consultants’ are “selling them a dream,” he said, adding: “[They are] selling a product essentially to people who don’t want to come back [home]. They have found their market.

TOI correspondent from Washington:

Asim Munir for President? Pakistan Defence Minister Denies Amid Buzz Of Asif Ali Zardari Quitting





A political and diplomatic dogfight is underway over a prospective visit to Pakistan by US President Donald Trump en route to the Quad summit in India in September amid a gradual recalibration of ties in the region.Pakistani business leaders and influencers are working overtime to convince the White House of a Trump visit after pulling off a coup by arranging a luncheon meeting last month for the country's army chief Asim Munir with the US President.Munir charmed Trump by endorsing him for a Nobel Peace Prize, playing up to his craving for one, and the Pakistanis are now promising the US President more honors and trade access if he visits, despite having thrown itself at China's feet for survival.Although the White House has not confirmed Trump's Quad attendance given New Delhi is yet to nail the dates -- which also depends on the leaders of Japan and Australia -- Pakistan's excitable media broadcast that the US President would visit Pakistan on September 18, before retracting the report because Trump will be on a state visit to the UK from September 17-19.There are indications though that Trump may stopover in Pakistan whenever he heads out to the Quad summit.This could be as late as November given the MAGA supremo's obsession with trade deals over strategic alignments. He has just delivered a tariff shock to Japan and also riled up Australia, while India has proved to be a tough negotiator, frustrating his trade boffins attempts to strong-arm New Delhi into a quick deal.In fact, Trump's fetish for tariffs and his fixation on trade deals puts a question mark over the strategic salience of the Quad even as long-time allies and partners adjust to his mercurial approach.According to some diplomats, India itself may have to reassess its approach to Trump-era Washington after a rosy-eyed view of long-term strategic ties with the US. They acknowledge that Trump’s response during his second term to the Pakistani outreach – driven more by opportunism than any strategic vision – clearly caught India off guard. New Delhi resents the re-hyphenation that would be implicit in such a two-fer, but has no way of thwarting it.If Trump does visit Pakistan, it will be the first US Presidential trip to the country in nearly two decades after George W Bush layover in 2006. Bush stopped by in Islamabad for a few hours under a tight security blanket on his way back from a three-day visit to New Delhi, talking up counter-terrorism cooperation with Pakistan while rejecting its pleas for a nuclear deal similar to the one he forged with India.Presidents Obama and Biden both disdained even a stopover while Trump himself trashed Pakistan during his first term, accusing it of ""nothing but lies & deceit"" and providing ""safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan.""Pakistan is now promising to turn itself into a safe haven for US businesses promoted by Trump associates -- including transforming Islamabad into the ""crypto capital of South Asia"" and a ""global leader in the digital finance revolution,’ -- to land a Presidential visit.During his first term, Trump is famously said to have complained about landing in Iraq and Afghanistan with the lights on Air Force One turned off (as a security measure), despite the US having spent billions on the countries. If the Pakistan stopover comes through, he may well insist on landing in full sight – to soak up the fanfare and flattery.","Pakistani business leaders and influencers are working overtime to convince the White House of a Trump visit. Pakistanis are now promising the US President more honors and trade access if he visits. If Trump does visit Pakistan, it will be the first US Presidential trip to the country in nearly two decades.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122657417,width-400,resizemode-4/122657417.jpg"
