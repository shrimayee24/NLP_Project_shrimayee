NEW DELHI: The NHRC has sent a notice to the Dehradun district magistrate and the SSP over the allegedly racially charged killing of a student from Tripura in the Uttarakhand capital.The national human rights commission has directed the Dehradun authorities to investigate the allegations and has sought an action taken report within seven days.The commission has asked for a copy of the case proceedings to be sent to the Uttarakhand chief secretary and the director general of police.""Additionally, the authorities are directed to ensure safety of the students of North Eastern region in the entire state,"" it says.Anjel Chakma, 24, a final-year MBA student at a private university in Dehradun, was allegedly attacked by some youngsters with a knife and a bracelet on December 9.

‘We Will Win In The End’: Kuldeep Sengar’s Daughter Speaks After SC order On Unnao Rape Sentence

'Public servant'

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday stayed a week-old Delhi high court order granting bail to former BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar, convicted of raping a minor in Uttar Pradesh's Unnao, during pendency of his appeal against conviction and ensured that he is not released from prison.Departing from the general practice of the apex court not interfering with HC orders granting bail, a bench of CJI Surya Kant, and Justices J K Maheshwari and A G Masih said the case against Sengar and the way the HC granted him bail raises several questions of law requiring deeper consideration.""Keeping in mind these peculiar circumstances, we deem it appropriate to stay the operation of the impugned order dated Dec 23 passed by HC. Consequently, the respondent (Sengar) shall not be released from custody..."" the bench said.One of the issues raised by CBI through solicitor general Tushar Mehta was that the HC failed to appreciate that Sengar, a public servant being an MLA, was in a dominant position and hence his offence of raping a minor girl must be construed as an aggravated form of sexual assault under IPC and Pocso Act Such an act under Pocso warrants stringent punishment, which under IPC shall not be less than 10 years imprisonment and could extend up to the entire natural life of the convict.When Sengar's counsels, senior advocates N Hariharan and Sidharth Dave, questioned the CBI contention about Sengar being a public servant, CJI Kant-led bench said, ""We are worried that if the proposition advanced by the convict is accepted then a patwari will be considered a public servant but not MPs and MLAs."" The bench sought Sengar's response to CBI's appeal and posted the matter for further consideration on Jan 20.Mehta said, ""A person may not be a 'public servant' for the purpose of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, but may still be a 'public servant' within the meaning of the Pocso Act if he is in such a dominant position as contemplated in other categories of Section 5.""""Considering the intent, object and purpose of the POCSO Act, an elected representative who wields enormous power and is in a position of dominance over children will have to be treated as a 'public servant' for the purposes of the Act, particularly when the Respondent Accused (Sengar) was an MLA of the same constituency where the victim/survivor resided,"" he said.""We are conscious of the fact that ordinarily when a convict/under-trial has been released on bail pursuant to an order passed by the trial court or the high court, such order shall not be stayed by this Court without hearing such person,"" the SC bench said. ""However, the instant matter revolves around certain unique facts and circumstances, wherein the respondent-convict is also separately convicted and sentenced in a case under Section 304 Part II of the IPC and is consequently still in custody. We are informed that in such proceedings also, the respondent-convict has applied for bail, and after hearing the arguments, the order is said to have been reserved by the concerned court.""The bench said the rape survivor had a statutory right to file a separate appeal against the HC order and required no SC permission. ""In case she needs any free legal aid, the Supreme Court Legal Services Committee is directed to provide such services to her. However, she may, if so advised, file her appeal through counsel of her own choice,"" it said.Hariharan pointed out innuendoes being hurled at the judges of HC bench which granted bail to Sengar and said some allegations going viral on social media were contemptuous. Mehta said the judges in HC division bench were among the finest in the country with unimpeachable integrity and condemned the personal attack unleashed against them.""There are always some elements who attempt to browbeat honest judges. Such devious forces must not be encouraged. The opinion of party (CBI) which lost before the bench of these two honest and brilliant judges must put an end to this controversy generated by some unscrupulous vested interests,"" he said.The bench agreed and said it is not uncommon that even the most brilliant and honest judges commit an error. ""These two HC judges are among the finest. But we (judges) are all prone to committing errors,"" CJI Kant said.","Former BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar was convicted of raping a minor in Uttar Pradesh's Unnao.

Peace deal ‘90% agreed’

Trump’s deadline: Weeks, not days

Optimism tempered by war on the ground





US President Donald Trump hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, even as Russia intensified its attacks on Kyiv. Both leaders struck an optimistic tone, repeatedly suggesting that a peace deal was closer than at any previous point, yet they also acknowledged that several issues particularly territory, security guarantees and the future of occupied infrastructure remain unresolved.“I think we’re getting a lot closer, maybe very close,” Trump said after the meeting. Zelenskyy, thanking Trump for a “great meeting”, said Ukraine was “ready for peace” and that talks had yielded “significant results”, even if final decisions were still pending.The talks came just hours after the 47th POTUS held a lengthy phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin , and against the backdrop of fresh Russian missile and drone strikes on Ukrainian cities.Zelenskyy’s visit followed what Trump described as an “excellent” phone call with Putin earlier the same day. The Kremlin later said the call was “friendly, benevolent and businesslike”, adding that Trump and Putin agreed to speak again promptly after Trump’s talks with the Ukrainian leader.Trump insisted Putin still wants peace, despite Russia launching new attacks on Ukraine as Zelenskyy travelled to the US.“Russia wants to see Ukraine succeed,” Trump said, adding that Putin had been “very generous in his feelings toward Ukraine succeeding”.That framing has alarmed some of Ukraine’s supporters, who note a pattern in which Trump speaks to Putin before meeting Zelenskyy. However, unlike previous encounters, this sequence did not lead to an openly tense exchange between the US and Ukrainian presidents.At the centre of the talks was a revised 20-point peace framework that US and Ukrainian teams have been refining for weeks. Zelenskyy said the plan was “90% agreed”, while Trump said he did not like using percentages but suggested the deal was nearly complete.“We discussed all aspects of the peace framework,” Zelenskyy later wrote. “We agreed that security guarantees are a key milestone in achieving lasting peace.”The two sides also agreed that their teams would meet again as early as next week to finalise remaining details, and that Trump would host Ukrainian and European leaders in Washington in January.Both leaders acknowledged that the fate of the eastern Donbas region remains unresolved. Trump described it as “a very tough issue”, though he said it was getting closer to resolution. Zelenskyy was blunt about the divide. “Our attitude is very clear,” he said, adding that Ukraine and Russia hold fundamentally different positions.Trump suggested that making territorial concessions sooner rather than later could be pragmatic. “Some of that land has been taken,” he said. “And are you better off making a deal now?”Zelenskyy has shown new flexibility, saying any territorial settlement would require either a referendum or parliamentary approval, but only after a ceasefire, something Moscow has so far rejected.Security guarantees emerged as the clearest area of convergence. Zelenskyy said US-Ukraine security guarantees were “100% agreed”, calling them essential to preventing future Russian aggression. Trump was more cautious, saying the talks were about “95% done” and stressing that European countries would need to shoulder much of the responsibility with US backing.During recent negotiations, Washington has floated Nato-like guarantees for Ukraine, even as Zelenskyy signalled he could drop Kyiv’s bid to formally join the alliance if equivalent protections were provided. Russia, however, has repeatedly rejected any Nato role and warned it would view allied troops as legitimate targets.Another unresolved issue is the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, which has been under Russian control since early in the war. Trump said the plant was discussed “at length” and suggested Putin was open to cooperation. “President Putin is actually working with Ukraine on getting it open,” he said.Under US proposals, the plant could be jointly run by the US, Russia and Ukraine, with shared profits. Zelenskyy is known to oppose any Russian commercial role, making this a potential flashpoint as talks continue.After their meeting, Trump and Zelenskyy spoke jointly by phone with a broad group of European leaders, including European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and the leaders of the UK, France, Germany, Poland and Finland.Von der Leyen later said progress was “good” but stressed that “ironclad security guarantees from day one” would be essential. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s office said leaders underlined the urgency of ending the war and commended Trump for driving talks forward.Trump repeatedly warned that negotiations could still collapse. “In a few weeks, we will know one way or the other,” he said. “It’s possible it doesn’t happen.”The US president, who once claimed he could end the war in a day, now openly acknowledges its complexity. “This is not a one-day process deal,” he said. “This is very complicated stuff.”Even as diplomacy intensifies, fighting continues. Russia launched major attacks on Kyiv and other regions ahead of the talks, knocking out power and heating for hundreds of thousands. Ukrainian officials described the strikes as evidence of Moscow’s true intentions.Still, both Trump and Zelenskyy emerged keen to project momentum. “I do think we’re getting a lot closer,” Trump said. Zelenskyy echoed that sentiment, thanking Trump and his team and reiterating: “Ukraine is ready for peace.”","US President Donald Trump hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.

Digvijaya Singh's Modi-RSS Praise Draws Jibes From BJP Amid CWC Meet

NEW DELHI: Amid the ongoing controversy over Digvijaya Singh 's remarks praising the RSS’s organisational strength, Andhra Pradesh chief minister Revanth Reddy hailed Sonia Gandhi 's role in Congress leadership, citing examples of elevation of Manmohan Singh and P V Narasimha Rao to the post of Prime Minister.In a social media post on X, Reddy, on the 140th foundation day of the Congress, said that the party “has shaped every defining chapter of modern India.”“Congress: a force for the people of India was born 140 years ago on this day. The story of the Indian National Congress is the story of Indian democracy in motion. When one reflects on the leadership of Smt Sonia Gandhi Ji, we find service, commitment, ethics and values,” Reddy said.“Under Smt Sonia Gandhi Ji’s leadership, it became possible for Shri P V Narasimha Rao garu, who started his public career from a remote village in Telangana, to rise to become Prime Minister of the country. Smt Sonia Gandhi Ji also made an economist like Dr Manmohan Singh Ji the Prime Minister. From leading India’s freedom struggle to framing the Constitution, from building democratic institutions to uniting a diverse nation, the Indian National Congress has shaped every defining chapter of modern India,” he added.This comes after Digvijaya Singh stirred a controversy by sharing a black-and-white photograph of Prime Minister Narendra Modi sitting on the floor near senior BJP leader L K Advani in Gujarat.Singh commented on the ability of grassroots workers to ascend through the ranks to become chief minister and eventually Prime Minister, attributing it to the “power of organisation.”He tagged several senior Congress leaders, including party president Mallikarjun Kharge, MPs Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Jairam Ramesh, Prime Minister Modi, and the official Congress handles.Reportedly, the former Madhya Pradesh chief minister rued “over-centralisation” in the Congress and pushed for decentralisation in the presence of top leadership at the CWC meeting held on Saturday.He also complained that district and state chiefs were appointed by the AICC and questioned why decisions taken at the Udaipur Chintan Shivir, including setting up an election management department, had not been implemented.Last week, Singh had also praised Rahul Gandhi for his stance on socio-economic issues, giving him “full marks,” while calling for internal reforms within the Congress. Drawing a parallel with Rahul Gandhi’s push for Election Commission reforms, Singh argued that the party itself needed similar changes.In another post on X, he wrote, “Rahul ji, you are absolutely ‘bang on’ in matters of socio-economic issues. Full marks. But now please look at Congress also. Like the Election Commission needs reforms, so does the Indian National Congress. You have started with ‘Sangathan Srijan’, but we need more pragmatic, decentralised functioning.”He added, “I am sure you would do it because I know you can do it. The only problem is that it is not easy to ‘convince’ you!!”","Andhra Pradesh chief minister Revanth Reddy hailed Sonia Gandhi's role in Congress leadership.

Cracks in MVA?

How the feud began

What the split led to

NEW DELHI: Are the senior and junior Pawars on the same side again? For the upcoming civic polls, the answer is yes. The Ajit Pawar-led NCP has announced that it will contest the Pimpri-Chinchwad and Pune local body elections together with the NCP ( Sharad Pawar faction).Announcing the tie-up, Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said the alliance is restricted to the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) elections, stressing that it is a local arrangement.“For the sake of the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation elections, the ‘clock’ and the ‘tutari’ (trumpet) have united. The parivar has come together,” deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said while announcing the alliance.""We are the ones who work for development. We will edge out those who tried to put this municipal corporation in debt,"" he added.Claiming the upcoming polls to be the ""fight of the workers"", NCP(SP) MLA Rohit Pawar said that the decision was taken listening to the views of party workers.""After speaking with all the party workers, Supriya Sule herself also interacted with the workers from Pune. Subsequently, discussions were held with workers from Pimpri-Chinchwad.This is a fight of the workers and their election. Therefore, after listening to their views and understanding their concerns, it was decided that both NCP factions will contest the polls together in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad. However, both parties will contest on their respective symbols. "" NCP (SP) MLA Rohit Pawar said.""This decision has been taken only for Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad, and that too after listening to the local workers and with their consent. Pawar Saheb is not involved in this entire decision-making process. Such senior leaders have never directly participated in municipal corporation elections. He only said that the views of those who fought for us should be heard and understood, and that decisions should be taken in accordance with what the workers decide. Therefore, this alliance has been formed in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad,"" he added.Meanwhile, the announcement also brought ripples in the Mahaviakas Aghadi Dal alliance partners seeking answers from Sharad Pawar.""This issue is limited to Pimpri-Chinchwad. As far as I think, they will not be in an alliance in Pune. Sharad Pawar needs to answer this, as he has always opposed the BJP, but now they are going with them. Pawar Saheb and Amit Shah need to respond to this,"" Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut said during a media briefing.Earlier, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Shirsat also hinted that there is a possibility of NCP (SP) joining the BJP-led NDA government.“Both the NCPs are coming together by forming an alliance for the upcoming municipal corporation elections,” he said, adding that such local-level adjustments could be a precursor to a broader political understanding.This comes two years after Ajit Pawar, along with a group of senior leaders, parted ways with his uncle Sharad Pawar and joined hands with BJP and Eknath Shinde's Shiv Sena in Maharashtra. He had raised objection over Sharad Pawar continuing to lead the party, despite old age.Ajit was sworn in as deputy chief minister under this new alliance. He favoured aligning with the ruling coalition, while Sharad Pawar's faction insisted on remaining with the opposition.The Election Commission later recognised Ajit's faction as the legitimate NCP, retaining the ‘clock' symbol. Meanwhile, Sharad Pawar's faction (NCP-SP) adopted the ‘tutari' (curved trumpet) symbol.Both factions contested elections separately. After the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, where his faction faced setbacks, Ajit Pawar acknowledged that turning his back on family had been a “mistake”.Ajit had justified his decision by saying that he joined hands with NDA to ""ensure stability and progress in Maharashtra.""""We are in alliance with the BJP and Shiv Sena, and many people ask me why I took the step of separating from the (undivided) NCP and why I accepted the strain on family and personal relationships. I want to tell you that I did this not for power or position, but to ensure stability and progress in Maharashtra.""""In other parties, leaders retire after an age. In the BJP, leaders retire at 75, when are you going to stop? You should also give new people a chance. If we make mistakes, tell us. Your age is 83, will you ever stop or not? You give us blessings,"" he added.In the Maharashtra assembly elections in 2024, Ajit Pawar’s NCP upped its score from a mere six Assembly segment leads in the Lok Sabha results to a tally of 41 MLAs, in the process beating the senior Pawar’s nominees in 27 head-to-head clashes; the latter won seven of those contests.The 2024 Maharashtra assembly elections saw the BJP-led Mahayuti alliance win 235 seats, including 132 for the BJP, 57 for the Shiv Sena, and 41 for the NCP (Ajit Pawar faction). The Maha Vikas Aghadi was reduced to 20 seats for Shiv Sena (UBT), 16 for the Congress, and 10 for the NCP (Sharad Pawar faction).","The NCP has announced that it will contest the Pimpri-Chinchwad and Pune local body elections together with the NCP ( Sharad Pawar faction) This comes two years after Ajit Pawar, along with a group of senior leaders, parted ways with his uncle Sharad.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126230609,imgsize-560805,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

The 'public servant' interpretation



Why it matters



Survivor welcomes SC intervention



(With agency inputs)

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday stepped in to stay the Delhi high court order that suspended the former BJP leader Kuldeep Singh Sengar’s life sentence in the 2017 Unnao rape case. On the Central Investigation Bureau's plea challenging the HC order, Supreme Court bench flagged serious legal concerns over the interpretation of the law and the implications it could have for accountability of elected representatives.A three-judge vacation bench led by Chief Justice Surya Kant, along with Justices JK Maheshwari and Augustine George Masih, stayed the execution of the high court’s December 23 order that had suspended Sengar’s life sentence under the POCSO Act Supreme Court made it clear that Sengar would not be released from jail, noting that he continues to remain in custody in another case related to the custodial death of the rape survivor’s father.While acknowledging that sentence suspensions are not usually stayed without hearing the convict, the bench said the ""peculiar facts"" of the case warranted immediate intervention.""Issue notice. We have heard solicitor general Tushar Mehta for CBI and senior advocate for the convict... Counter will be filed in four weeks. We are conscious of the fact that when a convict or an undertrial has been released, such orders are not ordinarily stayed by this court without hearing such persons.But in view of peculiar facts where the convict is convicted for a separate offence, we stay the operation of the Delhi high court order dated December 23, and thus the respondent shall not be released pursuant to the said order,"" the bench ordered.At the heart of the CBI plea is whether an MLA can be treated as a ""public servant"" for the purpose of aggravated offences under the POCSO Act.Appearing for the CBI, solicitor general Tushar Mehta argued that Sengar, who was a powerful MLA at the time of the crime, exercised dominance over the minor survivor and squarely fell within the scope of aggravated sexual assault under the law.Sengar’s counsel, senior advocates Siddharth Dave and N Hariharan, countered this by arguing that an MLA could not automatically be treated as a public servant under POCSO.The Supreme Court, however, expressed unease with the high court’s reasoning, warning that such an interpretation could lead to lawmakers being exempted from stricter punishment.""We are worried that a constable or patwari will be a public servant under the Act, but an MLA or MP will not be and get exempted,"" the bench observed.Section 5 of the POCSO Act treats sexual assault as ""aggravated"" if committed by a public servant or a person in a position of authority, attracting a minimum punishment of 20 years that can extend to life imprisonment.In 2019, a Delhi trial court had held that Sengar qualified as a public servant and sentenced him to imprisonment for the remainder of his natural life. The high court’s suspension of that sentence had triggered sharp criticism, with the CBI arguing that it diluted the intent of the law.The Supreme Court has now issued notice to Sengar and will examine whether the high court erred in excluding legislators from the definition of ""public servant"" under POCSO Act.Meanwhile, the Unnao rape survivor welcomed the Supreme Court’s order, saying she had full faith in the justice system and felt reassured by the apex court’s intervention.""I am very happy. I had faith in the Supreme Court. I will ensure that he is given a death sentence,"" she said speaking to the reporters.The survivor's mother has asked for security for her family and advocate saying, ""My family needs security. Our advocates need security.

'Called Chinki, Chinese, Momo': Tripura Student’s Killing In Dehradun Triggers Protests Across State

Shiv Sena (UBT) J&K unit chief Manish Sahni on Monday demanded a public apology from PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti for terming India “lynchistan” over the killing of a labourer from Bengal in Odisha’s Sambalpur and a tribal MBA student in Uttarakhand.“Mehbooba has no right to abuse the country,” Sahni said, questioning her silence on the carnage of Hindus in Bangladesh and the continued persecution of Hindus and other minorities in Pakistan.The PDP chief on Sunday alleged that the India of Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru had been turned into a “lynchistan”.Sahni said abusing one’s own country because of a handful of mischievous elements is like biting the hand that feeds you.

Unnao Rape Case: Activists Protest Outside Delhi High Court Over Sengar Bail

Aishwarya Sengar's big charge after SC order in Unnao case

NEW DELHI: Ishita Sengar, daughter of former BJP MLA and Unnao rape case convict Kuldeep Singh Sengar, penned an open letter on Monday saying that she is “exhausted, frightened and slowly losing faith”.Her statement came after the Supreme Court stayed a Delhi high court order that had suspended her father’s life sentence.In her letter, Ishita wrote: “I am writing this letter as a daughter who is exhausted, frightened, and slowly losing faith, but still holding on to hope because there is nowhere else left to go.”The Supreme Court stayed the operation of the December 23 Delhi high court order and directed that Kuldeep Singh Sengar shall not be released from prison in connection with the 2017 Unnao rape case.A three-judge vacation bench comprising Chief Justice of India Surya Kant and Justices JK Maheshwari and AG Masih passed the order while hearing a plea filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The bench observed that although courts usually do not stay bail orders once a convict is released, the present case involved “peculiar facts” as Sengar remains in jail in another criminal case.“We are conscious of the fact that when a convict or an undertrial has been released, such orders are not ordinarily stayed by this court.But in view of the peculiar facts where the convict is convicted for a separate offence, we stay the operation of the Delhi High Court order,” the bench said.Also read: 'Will ensure Kuldeep Sengar is given death sentence- Unnao rape survivor hails SC decision; what she said Kuldeep Singh Sengar, an expelled BJP MLA from Unnao, was sentenced to life imprisonment in December 2019 for the rape of a minor under the Indian Penal Code and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. He is also serving a separate 10-year sentence in a CBI case related to the custodial death of the rape survivor’s father.In her letter addressed to the “Hon’ble Authorities of the Republic of India,” Ishita Sengar said her family had waited silently for eight years, trusting the legal system.Explaining why the family chose not to protest publicly, she wrote: “We chose silence not because we were powerful, but because we believed in institutions. We waited because we believed that truth does not need spectacle.”She alleged that despite being labelled “powerful” because of her father’s political identity, her family remained unheard.“People call us ‘powerful.’ I ask you what kind of power leaves a family voiceless for eight years?” she said. Ishita added that her family had been “drained financially, emotionally, and physically” while seeking justice.Also read: SC stays Delhi HC order granting bail to Kuldeep Sengar; ex-BJP MLA to remain in jail Ishita also claimed she had received rape and death threats on social media over the years, which eventually silenced her.“Over these years, I have been told countless times that I should be raped, killed, or punished simply for existing,” she wrote, describing the abuse as “daily” and “relentless.”She further expressed concern that fear and public outrage were beginning to overshadow facts and due process.“If pressure and public frenzy begin to overshadow evidence and due process, what protection does an ordinary citizen truly have?” she asked.Clarifying her intent, Ishita said the letter was not written to seek sympathy or special treatment.“We are not asking for a favour. We are asking for justice because we are human,” she wrote, urging that the law be allowed to function “without fear” and evidence be examined “without pressure.”During the Supreme Court hearing, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the CBI, described the case as a “very horrific” instance of child rape and argued that Sengar, being an MLA at the time, occupied a dominant position over the victim, attracting stricter punishment under the POCSO Act.The bench also expressed concern that excluding lawmakers from the definition of “public servant” under POCSO could create legal immunity for MPs and MLAs.Meanwhile, the rape survivor’s mother welcomed the Supreme Court’s order, saying it gave her hope that her daughter would finally get justice.The Supreme Court has issued notice to Sengar and sought his response within four weeks. The matter is scheduled to be heard again in the last week of January.Following the apex court’s decision, Kuldeep's daughter Aishwarya Sengar alleged that her family was not given an opportunity to present its arguments on the merits of the case and claimed that key facts were being overlooked.“We couldn’t even start arguing on the merits of the case today, that she has changed her statement several times, changed the timing thrice, starting from 2 pm, 6 pm and then finally 8 pm. There’s a finding of the AIIMS medical board that she was more than 18. I’ve been fighting for justice for the past eight years, but maybe the sorrows of me and my family mean nothing. We have been stripped of our dignity, our peace, and even our fundamental right to be heard. Still hope for justice. I request that the media not spread any misinformation,” Aishwarya said.","Ishita Sengar penned an open letter on Monday saying that she is “exhausted, frightened and slowly losing faith” Her statement came after the Supreme Court stayed a Delhi high court order that had suspended her father’s life sentence.

Indian Army Displays Turkish Yiiha Drone Used By Pakistan During Operation Sindoor

Cops seized Monday an unidentified drone abandoned in a field near the Pakistan border in J&K’s Poonch district, while seven rounds of magazines for an AK-series rifle were found strewn in Udhampur district, over 270 km away.Officials clarified that the drone was not a defence equipment but among many such devices often used for taking photos at weddings and other social gatherings. Still, the discovery sparked fears of espionage as the site is near the Mendhar sector of the border.“Special Operations Group (SOG) of J&K police received an input about the drone abandoned in a field belonging to one Mohd Shafiq in Gohled village. After the information, SOG rushed and seized the drone,” an official said.The magazines were found in an open field at Sudhmahadev village in Udhampur’s Chenani area during a search by security forces, officials said. A probe is on. No one has been arrested so far.In Jammu’s Pragwal area, forces seized an aircraft shaped-balloon bearing the mark “PIA” -- short for Pakistan International Airlines -- from the border village Gurah Manhasa, the officials said.At Barmini on Jammu city’s outskirts, a man travelling in a Scorpio was arrested during checks, allegedly with an illegal 12-bore gun and two cartridges.

"On the roof of the world, feral dogs hunt down Ladakh’s rare species",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ladkah-on-the-roof-of-the-world-feral-dogs-hunt-down-ladakhs-rare-species/articleshow/126218554.cms,"Lean, feral dogs move with predatory intensity across a snow-dusted desert, Ladakh's stark peaks looming behind.

SRINAGAR: It’s bloody murder on the roof of the world.A new predator has quietly grown to dangerous numbers. Feral dogs roam the cold desert of Ladakh, preying, often in packs, on endangered wildlife and attacking people. Conservationists warn that they outnumber native predators in the region.What began as a byproduct of increased tourism, military deployment, and unmanaged waste in the cold desert moonscape of Ladakh has grown into a full-blown crisis. And it’s manmade.Scientists and wildlife officials warn that these free-ranging canines — estimated by the WCBCL at nearly 45,000, far in excess of what the region’s ecology can sustain — are preying on some of Ladakh’s rarest high-altitude species. They threaten snow leopards, wolves and foxes, and prey on rare species like Pallas’s cat, the Eurasian lynx, Tibetan gazelle, blue sheep, ibex, and Himalayan marmots, said Lobzang Visuddha, chairman of the Wildlife Conservation and Birds Club of Ladakh (WCBCL), a community-based voluntary initiative by young people.The killing of a Pallas’s cat, one of the rarest and least-studied species, by feral dogs in Anley last year has alarmed conservationists like Visuddha. “In fact, there are records of killing two Pallas’s cats and Eurasian lynxes by feral dogs,” he saidThe dogs also threaten ground-nesting birds, with packs frequently chasing black-necked cranes, the UT’s state bird, and attacking ruddy shelduck chicks when they move from rocky nesting sites to nearby water bodies, Visuddha said.Advocate Tashi Gyalson, who headed the local government in Leh as chairman of the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council from Nov 2020 to Nov 2025, said the issue hasn't been arisen all of a sudden. “We have to admit that this situation has actually been created by humans over a long period of time,” he said.Gyalson said these dogs have been part of the ecosystem and community but rapid urbanisation meant they lost their use as hunting dogs, shepherd dogs, watchdogs and companion animals. “This, multiplied by the abundant carrying capacity of the environment, caused their rapid multiplication, and eventually caused the current situation,” he said.Experts say the worst hit is eastern Ladakh, the region with the highest concentration of wildlife, where poor waste management are subsidising the dog population.“The main concern is the availability of excess kitchen waste in areas occupied by the Army and areas where there is tourism,” Gyalson said.The stretch from Kargyan Chibra to Tsokar, in eastern Ladakh, has become a hotspot for feral dog activity due to unsustainable waste “Feral dogs are by far the most serious threat as far as the wildlife of Ladakh is concerned. I have myself seen how stray dogs in Hanle and Tso Moriri actually raided the nests of the black-necked crane, and preyed upon the eggs and young ones,” said Intesar Suhail, who was wildlife warden of Ladakh in 2013-14.“I have even seen them chasing animals as big as the Tibetan wild ass. The active ground nests of waterbirds, particularly the black-necked crane and bar-headed goose, are more vulnerable as they are located in marshy areas, surrounded by shallow waters easily accessible to dogs,” he said.A strong sense of smell and pack behaviour give feral dogs a lethal advantage over wildlife that evolved without such human-introduced predators, Visuddha said.“Though these species face natural threats in the wild, feral dogs are not one of them, they are a problem introduced by humans,” said the WCBCL founder.Ladakh has also reported at least five fatal attacks on humans, mostly on women and children, by feral dogs, which was unheard of in the region until recently, he said.Phuntsog Wangail, president of the Chamba Animal Welfare Society, which runs Ladakh’s largest animal care facility, said Ladakh was facing growing fears of long-term ecological imbalance due to feral dogs.They survive largely on food waste from tourist camps, hotels, roadside dhabas and temporary settlements. When these facilities close or relocate, particularly during winter, the canines are left without reliable food sources and begin roaming over long distances.“This seasonal movement pushes dogs into wildlife habitats, increases territorial conflicts, and accelerates breeding, placing Ladakh’s fragile ecosystem under severe pressure,” Wangail said.Visuddha said the feral dog threat to wildlife of Ladakh was next only to human activity.The rapid infrastructure expansion, including road building, power lines and mobile towers, has already fragmented habitats, while the expansion of camps, resorts, guest houses and hotels has intensified pressure on wildlife, he said.In winter, when tourism grinds to a halt and food becomes scarce, the dogs roam extensively, leading to a rise in dog-bite cases, road accidents and formation of aggressive packs. “At the same time, winter offers the best window for sterilisation, as dogs tend to remain closer to human settlements.”Data from the Animal Husbandry Department in Leh shows that 32,887 dogs were sterilised between 2015 and 2024, yet officials and conservationists say the population remains dangerously high.Wangial said Ladakh should carry out mass sterilisation over the next two years, with a special focus on female dogs and puppies, while calling for strict enforcement of animal welfare laws, including heavy penalties for dog dislocation, abandonment and cruelty.He called for the replication of successful models from the Netherlands and Bhutan, where mass sterilisation, strict enforcement of animal welfare laws and strong community participation have led to significant reductions in stray populations.While Visuddha said govt appears unconcerned about the issue, Gyalson offered a contrasting view. He said that after Ladakh became a Union Territory in 2019, a mission-mode campaign was launched to control the dog population. “The impact of the programme is visible as there are far fewer street puppies, especially in Leh city,” he said.However, Gyalson said several challenges continue to hinder effective population control, including Ladakh’s vast and rugged terrain, extreme climate, dispersed dog population, difficulties in capturing animals, and the absence of an accurate census.","Scientists and wildlife officials warn that these free-ranging canines — estimated by the WCBCL at nearly 45,000 — are preying on some of Ladakh’s rarest high-altitude species.

""I saw my child in a critical condition; his left arm and leg were paralysed because he had been stabbed twice in the back. Blood was gushing from his head,"" he said.He said that the case was registered only when he reached Dehradun.""I went to the police to report the incident, and they reviewed the CCTV footage from the scene.

We will ensure the culprits receive the harshest punishment,"" ANI quoted Dhami saying.""We are with you in this hour of need. We'll provide whatever help we can,"" he added.According to a police complaint, Anjel and his brother Michael Chakma (21) were stopped by a group of six men who allegedly abused them with racial slurs, including “Chinki,” “Chinese,” and “Momo.”The case was registered on December 12, based on Michael Chakma’s complaint, under provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita relating to voluntarily causing hurt, the use of dangerous weapons, and criminal intimidation. On December 14, after doctors assessed the gravity of the injuries, police invoked additional charges of attempted murder and criminal conspiracy.Five of the six accused, including two juveniles, were arrested on December 14, while the prime accused, Yagya Awasthi, remains at large. Police said Awasthi is believed to have fled to Nepal. Officials said a police team has been dispatched to Nepal to track down the prime accused.","Tripura student Anjel Chakma died in a fatal racial attack in Dehradun, Uttarakhand.

Supreme Court Halts Bail For Ex-BJP MLA Kuldeep Sengar In Unnao Rape Case, Signals Tough Stand

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday noted that some individuals are attempting to gain ""political advantage"" after lawyers for expelled BJP leader Kuldeep Singh Sengar claimed that allegations had been made against the Delhi high court judges who had suspended his life sentence in the Unnao rape case.""We understand it. We are not sitting in ivory towers. We understand that people are trying to take political advantage and there are people who are trying to take advantage,"" said CJI Surya Kant, who was heading a three-judge vacation bench.Senior advocate N Hariharan, representing Sengar, highlighted that certain individuals were making allegations against the high court judges who handled the case.He urged such persons to refrain from making statements or accusations against the judges, noting that a circulating video containing these allegations was a matter of concern.""They are doing that on national television,"" Hariharan said, as cited by PTI.Another lawyer representing Sengar said that photographs of the high court judges were also being circulated. The bench noted that such actions overlook the fact that Sengar was convicted by the judiciary itself.“Very frankly, these judges are one of the finest we have,” said the bench, also comprising Justices J K Maheshwari and Augustine George Masih, during the hearing.Later, when asked about the allegations against the judges, solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the CBI, stated unequivocally that both the high court judges are ""brilliant judges with unimpeachable integrity,” adding that any attempt to malign them must be strongly condemned, as cited by PTI.The Supreme Court stayed a Delhi high court order that had suspended Kuldeep Singh Sengar’s life sentence and granted him bail in the 2017 Unnao rape case. The apex court also issued a notice to Sengar, directing him to respond within four weeks to the CBI’s plea challenging the high court order.The high court had suspended Sengar’s sentence pending the outcome of his appeal against the 2019 trial court verdict in the rape case. However, he will remain in jail, as he is also serving a 10-year sentence in the custodial death case of the victim’s father and has not been granted bail in that matter.The survivor on Monday vowed to pursue the death penalty for Sengar and welcomed the Supreme Court’s decision to stay the Delhi High Court’s suspension of his life sentence.""I am very happy. I had faith in the Supreme Court. I will ensure that he is given a death sentence,"" she said while speaking to reporters.The Unnao rape survivor, who was a minor in 2017, was allegedly abducted and sexually assaulted by Kuldeep Singh Sengar between June 11 and 20, and was later sold before being rescued from the Maakhi police station.","Supreme Court Halts Bail For Ex-BJP MLA Kuldeep Sengar In Unnao Rape Case, Signals Tough Stand.

Live-fire war games: China launches drills around Taiwan; Taipei mobilises forces,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/live-fire-war-games-china-launches-drills-around-taiwan-taipei-mobilises-forces/articleshow/126227109.cms,"ON CAM: Chinese Warships, Fighter Jets & Troops Encircle Taiwan; PLA Moves In For Invasion?

China on Monday launched large-scale live-fire military drills around Taiwan, deploying warships, fighter jets, bombers and unmanned aerial vehicles in what Beijing described as a stern warning to supporters of Taiwanese independence and foreign powers, as the island placed its forces on high alert and vowed to defend its democracy.Taiwan’s defence ministry said that as of 3 pm, it had detected 89 Chinese military aircraft and drones, with 67 entering Taiwan’s response area.China’s People’s Liberation Army said the exercises, code-named “Justice Mission 2025”, included live-fire training on maritime targets to the north and southwest of Taiwan. The PLA Eastern Theatre Command said the drills involved destroyers, frigates, aircraft and rocket forces and would continue into Tuesday, including simulated strikes and exercises aimed at blockading key ports.“This (the drills) serves as a serious warning to ‘Taiwan Independence’ separatist forces and external interference forces,” said Shi Yi, spokesperson for the Eastern Theatre Command.Taiwan’s military said it had activated its response mechanisms and deployed forces in reaction to the drills. “A response centre has been established, and appropriate forces have been deployed,” the military said, adding that its armed forces had carried out a rapid response exercise.A senior Taiwan security official told Reuters that dozens of Chinese military aircraft and vessels were operating around the island, with some “deliberately closing in” on Taiwan’s contiguous zone, defined as 24 nautical miles from its coast.Taiwan’s defence ministry said Chinese aircraft and ships had been detected operating around the island over the past 24 hours and that the military remained on high alert. “All members of our armed forces will remain highly vigilant and fully on guard, taking concrete action to defend the values of democracy and freedom,” the ministry said.Taiwan’s government condemned the exercises, while the defence ministry posted a video on Facebook showcasing weapons including US-made HIMARS rocket systems, which could strike coastal targets in China’s Fujian province in the event of a conflict.The coast guard said it had dispatched large vessels to respond to Chinese coast guard activity near Taiwan’s waters and was coordinating with the military to minimise disruption to shipping lanes and fishing areas. Taiwan’s aviation authority said China had designated a temporary danger zone in Taipei’s airspace for live-fire drills scheduled for Tuesday and that alternative flight routes were being assessed.The drills mark China’s sixth major round of war games around Taiwan since 2022 and come 11 days after the United States announced $11.1 billion in arms sales to the island. Beijing had protested the package and warned it would “take forceful measures” in response.Analysts say China’s exercises are increasingly blurring the line between routine training and preparations that could be used to mask an actual attack, reducing warning time for Taiwan and its allies.China’s state media said the drills would focus on sealing off key ports including Keelung in the north and Kaohsiung in the south. The PLA released posters depicting targets locked across the island, accompanied by slogans such as “Shields of Justice: Smashing Illusions” and “Arrows of Justice: Control and Denial”.“Any foreign interference that touches the shield (of justice) shall perish!” one poster read. “Any separatist scoundrels who encounter the shield shall be destroyed!”The exercises follow rising tensions between Beijing and Tokyo after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi suggested that a Chinese attack on Taiwan could warrant a military response from Japan. Beijing summoned Japan’s ambassador and warned its citizens against travelling to the country.China claims Taiwan as part of its sovereign territory and has not ruled out using force to bring the self-governed island under its control. Taiwan rejects Beijing’s claims, insisting that only its people can decide the island’s future.“I think these drills are just meant to scare us,” said Lin Wei-ming, a 31-year-old teacher in Taipei. “Similar drills have happened before ... the political side of things can only be handled by Taiwan's current government and how they choose to respond.”Taiwan’s stock markets were largely unaffected by the drills, rising 0.8% to a record high in morning trading.","China launches large-scale live-fire military drills around Taiwan.

CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu police have detained four 17-year-old school dropouts for hacking a 20-year-old migrant worker from Odisha with sickles near abandoned railway quarters in Tiruttani, a temple town on Chennai's northwestern fringe, after filming the assault to post as a social media reel.The victim, K Suraj, recently arrived in Chennai following a family dispute and had been surviving on menial jobs, police said Monday.The attack unfolded Saturday evening aboard a Chennai-Tiruttani EMU local train. At Thiruvalangadu station, about 70km northwest of Chennai, the four juveniles boarded Suraj's compartment, allegedly drunk & carrying two sickles concealed in bags. Investigators said they planned to use the weapons while recording content for social media.A brief exchange in Hindi escalated into an argument that continued until the train reached Tiruttani station, around 90km from Chennai. After disembarking, the youths allegedly forced Suraj towards the railway quarters near the tracks. Three attacked him with sickles, with one flashing a ""victory sign"", while a fourth recorded the assault on a mobile phone, police said.Suraj suffered deep cut wounds. Bleeding heavily, he staggered to a nearby road, where passers-by alerted railway police. He was taken to Tiruttani govt hospital and later referred to Tiruvallur Govt Medical College Hospital, where doctors said his condition was stable. Police traced the suspects using the video uploaded to Instagram, locating them later that night near Gangai Amman temple along the Tiruttani-Arakkonam bypass, a highway stretch on the town's outskirts, where they were allegedly drinking.Produced before the Juvenile Justice Board, three were sent to a govt observation home. The fourth, described as differently abled, was released to his parents with a warning.","Four 17-year-old school dropouts detained for hacking migrant worker with sickles.

'Called Minor Matter, Refused FIR': Tripura Student Angel Chakma's Father Blasts Uttarakhand Police

NEW DELHI: Amidst outrage over the murder of Anjel Chakma, 24, from Tripura allegedly on racial grounds, a petition has been filed in Supreme Court seeking its intervention to protect people from north-eastern states from hate and racial abuse in other parts of the country.The petition, filed by advocate Anoop Prakash Awasthi, said that people from northeast are subjected to racial abuse across the country and they are targeted as if they are not citizens of the country. He said the repeated humiliation of north-eastern citizens by being called ""Chinese"" or ""chinky"" is not merely a matter of individual prejudice but it represents a fundamental misunderstanding of India itself and its civilisational and constitutional vision.Referring to TOI's report on the last words spoken by the deceased that he was also an Indian while appealing to the attackers not to target him, the petition said it's a failure of constitutional governance if a citizen has to assert nationality as a defence against violence.""What renders this incident constitutionally searing are the victim's reported last words, spoken in a moment of existential desperation: ""I am Indian...What certificate should we show?"" These words are not merely an expression of personal anguish; they constitute an indictment of the Republic's failure to make citizenship experientially real for all its people. When an Indian citizen, in the moments before death, feels compelled to assert nationality as a defence against violence, the promise of equality before law stands profoundly compromised,"" the petition said.It said the question raised by Chakma ""what certificate should we show"" exposes the informal but pervasive demand placed within our society upon racially distinct Indians to explain their citizenship which is unfortunate as Indianness flows from the Constitution, not from public perception or ethnic conformity.""The killing of Anjel Chakma must therefore be understood as the culmination of a social process rather than an aberration. It demonstrates how racial othering, when left unaddressed, travels a continuum, from verbal abuse to physical assault, and ultimately to homicide. The law's failure to interrupt this continuum at earlier stages amounts to a failure of constitutional governance. The vulnerability of citizens from the north-eastern States is not an unforeseen or emergent phenomenon. It stands formally acknowledged on the floor of Parliament itself. Centre, through replies given to questions raised in the Lok Sabha in March 2017, placed on record both the prevalence of racial attacks and the absence of any dedicated institutional mechanism to address them. These replies, read together, constitute clear executive admissions of knowledge coupled with inaction,"" the petition said.The petitioner said that a young student from Tripura being compelled to utter the words ""I am Indian...What certificate should we show?"" to avoid death was not merely a personal tragedy but a a civilisational indictment.""The incident was preceded by racial slurs questioning the victim's nationality and identity, reflecting a deeply entrenched social trope that citizens from the north-eastern states are ""outsiders"" within their own country, a trope which, when normalised by silence and institutional indifference, escalates from verbal abuse to lethal violence,"" the petition said, pleading the SC in intervene to frame guidelines as there was vacuum in policy.""The informal and pervasive demand placed upon north-eastern citizens to ""prove"" their nationality through appearance, language, or conduct is inherently unconstitutional, arbitrary, and discriminatory, and no such burden is imposed upon citizens whose physical features conform to socially constructed norms,"" the petition said.",Petition has been filed in Supreme Court seeking intervention to protect people from north-eastern states from hate and racial abuse in other parts of the country.

'Called Minor Matter, Refused FIR': Tripura Student Angel Chakma's Father Blasts Uttarakhand Police

Dehradun: Anjel Chakma, 24, a native of Tripura, had grown up across several states as his father served as a BSF head constable, moving from one posting to another. Family members said the frequent relocations shaped his childhood and made him adaptable, grounded, and aware of life's uncertainties from an early age. He was known to be calm, friendly, and non-confrontational, rarely getting into arguments or disputes.Earlier this month, Anjel was assaulted in Dehradun in what police have described as an alleged racist attack. He was attacked by a group of six individuals and sustained critical injuries, following which he died. Police arrested five of the accused, including two juveniles, while one accused remained absconding at the time. The incident triggered outrage among students and people from the northeastern states, who said the attack highlighted concerns over racial targeting and safety of youths from the region living and studying outside their home states.About a month ago, Anjel crossed a milestone the family had long waited for. After securing his first job through a campus placement at a French MNC, he returned home with plans already forming.Soon after sharing the news, he told his father that it was time to rest. ""You've done enough for us,"" he said, asking him to opt for the voluntary retirement scheme after years of service and constant movement.With his first salary in sight, Anjel began planning a more settled future for the family. He spoke about seeking a posting in Guwahati or Kolkata so he could remain closer to Tripura and asked his mother to be ready to move in with him once he settled. Relatives said he wanted to take on responsibility at home and had told them he would support the family financially, including funding his younger brother Michael's higher studies to ease the burden on his father.Anjel's maternal uncle, Momen Chakma, who had watched him grow up, said the young man's experiences across different states had made him mature beyond his years. ""He understood life's challenges very well and always wanted to support the family,"" he said. ""He never got into fights or brawls and preferred travelling and visiting new places whenever he got time.""It was that interest in travel and the outdoors that drew Anjel to Uttarakhand. He admired the state's hill terrain and spoke often about trekking routes and mountain trails. He persuaded Michael, 21, to pursue higher studies from Dehradun and encouraged him to explore the region beyond classrooms and hostels.The brothers had planned a Chandrashila trek on Dec 22, after Michael's examinations were to end. Anjel had discussed the route, checked the weather, and ordered new trekking shoes for the trip, looking forward to spending time together in the mountains he admired. The trekking shoes arrived at his house a day after he was attacked. They still remain unpacked.","Anjel Chakma, 24, a native of Tripura, had grown up across several states as his father served as a BSF head constable.

Gaza ceasefire: Phase two still elusive

Praise-heavy optics, divisions beneath

Trump’s assertion on Netanyahu’s pardon

Clear red lines from Washington for Iran

Broader regional focus





US President Donald Trump on Monday met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at Mar-a-Lago, Florida, over the Gaza peace plan but steered clear of announcing any progress on the next phase of the ceasefire.The two leaders held a private lunch at Trump’s Florida residence, with the US President saying ahead of the meeting that he planned to discuss “five major subjects,” including Gaza, the occupied West Bank and Iran.While Trump later suggested that several issues were quickly narrowed, no concrete decisions were unveiled after more than an hour of talks.Also read: ‘We will knock them down’ — Trump draws red line on Iran’s missile programme; Tehran fires back with warning A central focus of the meeting was the stalled second phase of the US-brokered Gaza truce, which is meant to pave the way for an interim Palestinian administration, an international stabilization force and reconstruction of the region which is in shambles after over two-years of current war.Trump played down the lack of visible progress, saying he was “not concerned about anything that Israel’s doing” and asserting that Israel had “lived up” to its commitments.He placed responsibility squarely on Hamas, warning: “If they don’t disarm as they agreed to do, then there will be hell to pay for them. They have to disarm in a fairly short period of time.”Hamas’s armed wing reiterated on Monday that it would not surrender its weapons.Trump nevertheless insisted, “Israel’s lived up to the plan 100 per cent,” adding, “They’re strong. They’re solid,” reported CNN.The talks at Mar-a-Lago were dominated by mutual praise.“We’ve never had a friend like President Trump in the White House. It’s not even close,” Netanyahu said on arrival. Trump returned the compliment, calling their ties “extraordinary” and remarking, “If you had a weak man, you wouldn’t have Israel right now. Israel, with most other leaders, would not exist today.”Netanyahu announced that Israel would award Trump its highest civilian honour, marking the first time it would go to a non-Israeli.“President Trump has broken so many conventions to surprise people, so we decided to break a convention or create a new one,” Netanyahu said.Trump said the recognition was “really surprising and very much appreciated,” and described Netanyahu as a “wartime” leader.However, Trump acknowledged lingering differences, particularly over the West Bank. “We’ve had a discussion, big discussion, for a long time on the West Bank, and I wouldn’t say we agree on the West Bank 100 per cent,” he told CNN, reiterating his opposition to annexation.Trump also weighed in on Netanyahu’s ongoing corruption trial, saying a pardon was imminent. “How do you not give a pardon? He is a wartime prime minister who is a hero,” Trump said. “I spoke with President Isaac Herzog. He tells me it is on its way,” as he talked about his lobbying attempt to secure Netanyahu a Presidential pardon.However, Israel president quickly disputed the claim. In a clarification cited by CNN, Israeli President Isaac Herzog’s office said, “There has been no conversation between President Herzog and President Trump since the pardon request was submitted,” adding that any decision would follow standard legal procedures.Netanyahu is Israel’s first sitting prime minister to face criminal charges. He is on trial in three cases filed in 2019 alleging bribery, fraud and breach of trust, which he denies.On November 30, he formally sought clemency, arguing that court proceedings hamper his ability to govern. While Israel’s president has the power to grant pardons, there is no precedent for doing so while a trial is ongoing.Trump’s most aggressive remarks were reserved for Iran, amid Israeli concerns that Tehran is rebuilding its ballistic missile capabilities following US and Israeli strikes earlier this year on its nuclear facility.“I hear that Iran is trying to build up again, and if they are, we’re going to have to knock them down,” Trump said, adding, “We’ll knock the hell out of them.”He warned of “very powerful” consequences if Iran pursued new nuclear or missile sites, though he said he still believed Tehran might be open to a deal. Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons.A senior adviser to Iran’s supreme leader responded that any aggression would face an “immediate harsh response,” AFP reported.Beyond Gaza and Iran, the talks touched on Syria and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Trump said he hoped Netanyahu could “get along” with Syria’s new president, who came to power after the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad last year.Netanyahu’s visit capped a busy diplomatic stretch for Trump at Mar-a-Lago, following talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Despite repeated references to reconstruction and future governance in Gaza, Trump offered few specifics, leaving the path ahead - in Gaza and across the region - uncertain.","US President Donald Trump met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at Mar- a-Lago, Florida, over the Gaza peace plan.

His comments became part of a larger conversation about public grief, leadership, and public image.During the podcast, Tim Dillon spoke directly about what he saw happening. He said:“Erika Kirk, God bless, tragic. I am sorry for what happened, but nobody knows why she’s out there in a glittering pant suit in a recreated tent that her husband tragically was murdered in throwing merch out. She’s out there talking to Nicki Minaj. People are confused. What’s going on? Those are the three words that sum up this whole entire mess.”Dillon was referring to Erika Kirk hosting a public conversation with Nicki Minaj during the 2025 America Fest. The appearance came weeks after Minaj publicly voiced support for Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance.On stage, Minaj praised both leaders and made a slip of the tongue while speaking about Vance. Erika Kirk calmly responded, saying:“Trust me, there’s nothing new under the sun that I have not heard.So you’re fine. I love you. You have to laugh about it, truly.”Erika Kirk also reassured Nicki Minaj later, adding:“I love this woman. She has a soul and a heart for the Lord, and words are words. I know her heart.”After her husband’s reported death at a Utah Valley University event, Erika Kirk stepped into a leadership role at Turning Point USA. She has said she plans to continue the work and tours started by Charlie Kirk.Nicki Minaj, who once criticized Donald Trump’s immigration policies in 2018, has since shifted her public stance.

'Very angry': Trump on alleged Ukrainian drone attack on Putin's residence; Zelenskyy calls it 'lies',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/ukraine-attacked-vladimir-putins-residence-russias-big-charge-against-kyiv/articleshow/126235219.cms,"Donald Trump, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Vladimir Putin (AP)

'Very angry': Donald Trump on 'drone attack'





Russia on Monday claimed that Ukraine fired drones at Vladimir Putin's residence between Moscow and Saint Petersburg, Reuters reported citing foreign minister Sergey Lavrov.Lavrov added that the Kremlin would ""revise"" its negotiating position on ending the Ukraine war after the ""terrorist attack"". Lavrov further said that Russia had chosen targets in Ukraine for ""retaliation strikes"" and that Moscow's ""negotiating position will be revised"". As per the report, Lavrov said that Ukraine targeted the Russian president’s state residence in the Novgorod region on December 28–29, with 91 long-range drones, all of which were intercepted and destroyed by Russian air defences.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy dismissed the accusation as ""lies"", saying Moscow was laying the groundwork for attacks on government buildings in Kyiv.""This alleged 'residence strike' story is a complete fabrication intended to justify additional attacks against Ukraine, including Kyiv, as well as Russia’s own refusal to take necessary steps to end the war. Typical Russian lies. Furthermore, the Russians have already targeted Kyiv in the past, including the Cabinet of Ministers building,"" he said.""Ukraine does not take steps that can undermine diplomacy. To the contrary, Russia always takes such steps. This is one of many differences between us. It is critical that the world doesn’t stay silent now. We cannot allow Russia to undermine the work on achieving a lasting peace,"" he added.This comes after Putin claimed that Russia was making progress in its plans of ""liberating the Donbas, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions"".""The goal of liberating the Donbas, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions is being carried out in stages, in accordance with the plan of the special military operation ... The troops are confidently advancing,"" AFP quoted Putin saying.Zelenskyy said that Russia’s attacks on Ukraine and Putin’s messaging to the domestic audience contradicted the “peaceful rhetoric” he has used in conversations with US leader Donald Trump.""On the one hand, he tells the president of the United States that he wants to end the war and that this is his desire,"" Zelenskyy said.""And on the other hand, he openly communicates in the media all his messages about being ready and wanting to continue the war -- he strikes us with missiles, openly talks about it, celebrates the destruction of civilian infrastructure, gives instructions to his generals about where to advance and what to seize, and so on,"" he added.Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump criticised the alleged Ukrainian drone attack, saying he was informed by Putin during their conversation regarding Ukraine, which the White House described as a ""positive"" one.""President Trump has concluded a positive call with President Putin concerning Ukraine,"" Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on X.""You know who told me about it? President Putin, early in the morning, he said he was attacked. It's no good. I'm very angry,"" Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida, according to AFP.""It's a delicate period of time. This is not the right time. It's one thing to be offensive because they're offensive. It's another thing to attack his house. It's not the right time to do any of that,"" he added.","Russia claims Ukraine fired 91 long-range drones at Vladimir Putin's residence between Moscow and Saint Petersburg.

A video of a Texas woman expressing anguish over how Texas cities have been taken over by Indians has gone viral.

""My old apartment in Irving, Texas, had a Gandhi statue right across the street in the middle of the park. You can't go into Costco or HEB without feeling like you're in a foreign country.

The video was made around three weeks ago.The video went viral as social media users added the names of the US cities which are experiencing a similar situation.Some users said they are not bothered by the increasing Indian population in Texas as they are not committing crime. ""Many of those “Indians” are probably engineers, doctors or scientists that add a lot to Friscos economy. You’re probably just a stupid streamer who adds little to Friscos economy,"" one wrote.""This is a fact. The globalists are specifically targeting Texas and flooding it with third-worlders to destroy it from within. Texas is beginning to look like California, it's disgusting,"" Texas Republican leader Alexander Duncan said.

Badaun’s panic refuses to ease: Buffalo’s dog bite becomes village scare; villagers line up for anti-rabies shots,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/buffalo-dies-of-dog-bite-over-200-up-villagers-whohad-raita-made-from-its-milk-rush-for-rabies-shot/articleshow/126235229.cms,"Panic gripped Pipraul village after over 200 residents sought anti-rabies vaccines due to speculation that yogurt served at a funeral feast was made from a buffalo that died from rabies. The buffalo reportedly died three days after being bitten by a 'mad' dog, fueling anxiety as the dog and the exact cause of death remain unknown.

BAREILLY: More than 200 residents of Pipraul village in Badaun district suddenly queued up in large groups at a local health centre for precautionary anti-rabies vaccines after widespread speculation that 'raita', a side dish made up of yogurt, served at a funeral feast was from a buffalo which had died due to rabies after being bitten by a 'mad' dog.The feast was held on Dec 23 in memory of late Oran Sahu, a resident of Pipraul -- a village with a population of around 1,800 people, as per official records. Locals said villagers from nearby settlements also attended the 'tehravi' ceremony. One of them said that the buffalo belonged to Sahu's cousin who used its milk to prepare the 'raita' dish. Three days later, the buffalo died, sparking panic in and around the village.""People are anxious because no one knows much about rabies, and there is more hearsay than facts spreading here... Nearly 250 residents have taken the anti-rabies vaccine already, and others are lining up to do the same.Most of them have left all their work to get this done first,"" said Deepak Kumar, husband of village pradhan Renu Devi. He added villagers were particularly worried since the dog -- believed to have bitten the cattle -- could not be traced.Also, the buffalo was buried soon after its death without a postmortem, leaving health officials without a clue regarding the exact cause, Kumar said.A medical team has since been stationed in the village to monitor the situation and counsel residents. Health authorities said that they are vaccinating anyone seeking ""precautionary protection"".Budaun's chief medical officer, Dr Rameshwar Mishra, said, ""In two days, 247 residents from Pipraul came to our facility for vaccinations en masse. On Monday alone, 110 people got the shots. Counselling is also underway, and villagers are being advised not to panic.""Experts, meanwhile, said that current evidence does not support the widespread belief that rabies can be transmitted through milk.Dr Abhijeet Pawde, principal scientist and in-charge of IVRI (Indian Veterinary Research Institute) Polyclinic, told TOI, ""Studies so far do not conclusively show milk consumption as a mode of rabies transmission. No scientific literature confirms that rabies passes into milk in such cases. Transmission risk is higher via direct exposure to saliva or tissue.""","More than 200 residents of Pipraul village in Badaun district queue up for precautionary anti-rabies vaccines.

‘We will knock them down’: Trump draws red line on Iran’s missile programme; Tehran fires back with warning,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/we-will-knock-them-down-trump-draws-red-line-on-irans-missile-programme-tehran-fires-back-with-warning/articleshow/126243009.cms,"Trump Threatens To Bomb Iran Again If It Dares To Rebuild Nuclear Programme | ‘Full-Scale War…’

‘Any aggression will face an immediate harsh response’





US President Donald Trump on Monday said that Iran will have to face “very powerful” consequences if it tries to rebuild its missile programme.This comes after reports that Tehran may be attempting to rebuild its ballistic missile programme at sites different from those targeted by US strikes earlier this year. However, this development is yet to be confirmed.Speaking to reporters after his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump said, “Now I hear that Iran is trying to build up again. And if they are, we're going to have to knock them down. We'll knock them down. We'll knock the hell out of them. But hopefully that's not happening.”“I don't want to say it, but Iran may have been behaving badly. It hasn't been confirmed yet, but if it is, they know the consequences. The consequences will be powerful, maybe more powerful than last time. Iran should have made a deal last time. I had given them an option,” he added.The US President also said that he has been reading reports suggesting Iran could be rebuilding weapons infrastructure, but not at the locations previously hit by US forces.“I hope Iran is not trying to build up, as I've been reading, that they're building up weapons and other things,” he said.“If they are, they're not using the sites that we obliterated, but they're using possibly different sites.”Meanwhile, a top political adviser to Iran's Supreme Leader said that any aggression against the country would be met with an “immediate harsh response”, after Trump threatened to “eradicate” any attempt by Tehran to rebuild its nuclear programme.“Iran’s missile capability and defence are not containable or permission-based. Any aggression will face an immediate harsh response beyond its planners' imagination,” Ali Shamkhani wrote on X.Earlier this year, the US bombed three nuclear facilities in Iran in an operation Trump has repeatedly described as a major success that “obliterated” Iran's nuclear programme.The strike on Fordow, a heavily fortified underground facility, reportedly involved the use of six 30,000-pound “bunker buster” bombs — weapons deployable only by the US Air Force’s B-2 stealth bombers.However, Netanyahu has recently warned that Iran is again expanding its ballistic missile activities and is expected to press for tougher action during talks with Trump.","US President Donald Trump said that Iran will have to face “very powerful” consequences if it tries to rebuild its missile programme.

'Limited military operation': Saudi Arabia bombs Yemeni port; targets alleged weapon shipment that arrived from UAE,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/limited-military-operation-saudi-arabia-bombs-yemeni-port-targets-alleged-weapon-shipment-that-arrived-from-uae/articleshow/126242885.cms,"(Picture from X)

Saudi Fighter Jets 'Bombard' UAE-Backed Separatist Fighters In Yemen In Huge Escalation Over South





Saudi Arabia early Tuesday bombed the Yemeni port city of Mukalla, saying it was targeting a shipment of weapons that had arrived from the United Arab Emirates for a separatist group. The strike marked a sharp rise in tensions between Saudi Arabia and the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council (STC).It also added strain to the already uneasy relationship between Riyadh and Abu Dhabi, who have supported different sides in Yemen’s long war against the Iran-backed Houthi rebels.Saudi Arabia’s state news agency said the airstrikes were launched after two ships from Fujairah, a port in the UAE, arrived in Mukalla. The statement said the weapons unloaded from the ships posed a threat to security and stability, prompting a “limited military operation” to destroy them.The UAE has not yet commented on the strike.Mukalla lies in Yemen’s Hadramout region, which the STC recently captured. The city is about 480 kilometers northeast of Aden, the base of anti-Houthi forces since the rebels took over the capital, Sanaa, in 2014.Tuesday’s attack follows Saudi airstrikes last Friday that analysts saw as a warning to the STC to stop its advances and withdraw from Hadramout and Mahra.The STC had earlier pushed out the Saudi-backed National Shield Forces from those areas.STC supporters have been increasingly raising the old South Yemen flag. South Yemen existed as a separate country between 1967 and 1990, and recent demonstrations have called for restoring that independence.These moves by the separatists have increased friction between Saudi Arabia and the UAE. While both countries maintain close ties and work together in OPEC, they have been competing for influence and business in the region.At the same time, violence has also escalated in Sudan, another Red Sea country, where the two Gulf powers back rival sides in the ongoing conflict.","Saudi Arabia bombed the Yemeni port city of Mukalla, saying it was targeting a shipment of weapons that had arrived from the United Arab Emirates.

HIGH ALERT In US: 58,000,000 Under Winter Storm Warnings, 4000 More Flights 'Grounded' | Watch

Travellers faced flight disruptions

What is a bomb cyclone?

Blizzard conditions and power outages

Warnings remain as storm shifts east





A powerful winter storm rapidly intensified into a “bomb cyclone” across large parts of the United States on Monday, triggering widespread travel disruptions as the holiday season nears. The system grounded thousands of flights and brought blizzard conditions, strong winds and power outages from the Midwest to the East Coast.The storm, named Winter Storm Ezra, struck during one of the busiest travel periods of the year, leaving passengers stranded on Monday as airlines struggled to recover amid worsening weather conditions ahead of the New Year holiday. Visuals of the massive storm went viral across social media.Air travel faced severe disruption across the country. Nearly 6,000 flights were delayed and more than 750 cancelled by Monday afternoon, according to FlightAware. Since Friday, weather-related disruptions have led to over 3,600 cancellations and more than 30,000 delays nationwide, news agency AP reported.Major airports including Washington Dulles, Boston, Newark and Detroit imposed ground stops or delays due to high winds and poor visibility.Detroit Metropolitan Airport temporarily halted Delta Air Lines flights, adding to operational challenges. Airlines including American, United, Delta and JetBlue waived change fees for affected passengers.Road travel was also impacted as icy surfaces, blowing snow and near-zero visibility caused multi-vehicle pileups in several states. Authorities in parts of the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes urged residents to avoid non-essential travel, while the Federal Emergency Management Agency warned of dangerous driving conditions.A bomb cyclone is a rapidly intensifying storm that forms when atmospheric pressure drops sharply within 24 hours. This rapid strengthening fuels hurricane-force winds, heavy snow, ice and flooding rain.Meteorologists said the storm intensified as frigid Arctic air clashed with lingering warmth across southern parts of the US. The sharp cold front caused dramatic temperature swings, with parts of the central US experiencing drops of nearly 50 degrees Fahrenheit overnight. In Philadelphia, temperatures fell from near 60°F on Monday to the low 20s at night.The storm brought blizzard conditions to parts of the Plains, Midwest and Great Lakes, with dangerous wind chills plunging to minus 30°F in North Dakota and Minnesota. Snowfall reached up to two feet in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, while strong winds created whiteout conditions in several regions, Reuters reported.More than 350,000 customers were without power nationwide by Monday afternoon, with Michigan accounting for a significant share. In upstate New York, over 57,000 power outages were reported as freezing rain and high winds strained trees and power lines.Severe conditions extended to the Great Lakes, where waves on Lake Superior rose to nearly 20 feet, forcing most cargo ships to seek shelter. Along Lake Erie, strong winds caused water levels to surge on the eastern shoreline near Buffalo, raising concerns of lakeshore flooding.Forecasters warned that hazardous conditions, including snow, ice, flooding rain and strong winds, could persist into early Tuesday as the storm moves eastward. Parts of the Northeast faced freezing rain, while additional lake-effect snow and possible whiteouts were forecast in New York.Authorities urged travellers to stay updated on weather alerts and flight advisories as the powerful storm continues to impact large parts of the country.","Winter Storm Ezra brought blizzard conditions, strong winds and power outages from the Midwest to the East Coast.

From First Woman PM To Fierce Rivalry: Khaleda Zia’s Three Terms That Redefined Bangladesh Politics

Leaders worldwide offers condolences after the death of former PM





Former Bangladesh prime minister and Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chairperson Khaleda Zia died early Tuesday at the age of 80, party officials confirmed. She had been undergoing treatment at Evercare Hospital in Dhaka. According to her party, Zia died around 6.00 am, shortly after Fajr prayers, after remaining in critical condition for months.A dominant figure in Bangladesh’s politics for decades, Khaleda Zia was the country’s first woman prime minister and the long-time political rival of Sheikh Hasina. She had been suffering from multiple serious health complications, including heart, lung, liver and kidney ailments, diabetes and pneumonia. Zia had been under intensive medical care since November.Her death comes just days after her elder son and BNP’s acting chairperson Tarique Rahman returned to Bangladesh from London, ending 17 years of self-imposed exile as the country moves toward crucial national elections.Khaleda Zia was born in 1945 in Jalpaiguri and grew up in Dinajpur. She married Ziaur Rahman in 1960, who later became Bangladesh’s president after seizing power as a military chief in 1977.Following his assassination in a military coup in 1981, Khaleda, who had never been involved in politics, entered public life and took charge of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) in 1984.She emerged as a key leader in the mass movement against military ruler HM Ershad, earning a reputation as an uncompromising figure in the struggle to restore democracy. In 1991, she led the BNP to victory and became Bangladesh’s first elected woman prime minister, introducing the parliamentary system of government and later playing a role in establishing the caretaker government system for elections.Khaleda Zia served as prime minister two times from 1991 to 1996 and again from 2001 to 2006. Her political career was defined by a fierce rivalry with Sheikh Hasina, a contestant who shaped Bangladesh’s politics for more than three decades.In later years, Zia faced multiple corruption cases, which her party described as politically motivated. She was jailed in 2018 and remained largely confined due to illness after being granted temporary release in 2020. In January 2025, the Supreme Court acquitted her in the final corruption case against her, effectively clearing her name.Following Hasina’s ouster in a mass uprising in 2024, an interim government led by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus allowed Zia to travel abroad for advanced treatment. She returned from London in May but remained seriously ill and withdrew from active politics, though she continued as BNP chairperson until her death.Khaleda Zia is survived by her elder son Tarique Rahman, while her younger son, Arafat Rahman Koko died in 2015. Despite years of illness and imprisonment, she remains one of the most influential and polarising figures in Bangladesh’s political history.Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered his 'sincere condolences' after the death of Khaleda Zia and recalled his meeting with former PM in Dhaka in 2015.In a post on X, he wrote: ""Deeply saddened to learn about the passing away of former Prime Minister and BNP Chairperson Begum Khaleda Zia in Dhaka. Our sincerest condolences to her family and all the people of Bangladesh. May the Almighty grant her family the fortitude to bear this tragic loss. """"As the first woman Prime Minister of Bangladesh, her important contributions towards the development of Bangladesh, as well as India-Bangladesh relations, will always be remembered. I recall my warm meeting with her in Dhaka in 2015. We hope that her vision and legacy will continue to guide our partnership. May her soul rest in peace,"" PM Modi further wrote.Muhammad Yunus also expressed his profound grief over the death of former BNP chief and described her as a ""great guardian"" of the nation and a towering figure in Bangladesh's democratic history.""Begum Khaleda Zia was not merely the leader of a political party; she represented an important chapter in the history of Bangladesh,"" Yunus wrote in his message. The BNP has declared seven days of official mourning following her death.","Former Bangladesh PM Khaleda Zia has died at the age of 80. Zia was the country's first woman prime minister and long-time political rival of Sheikh Hasina. She had been suffering from multiple serious health complications, including heart, lung, liver and kidney ailments, diabetes and pneumonia.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126242736,imgsize-347459,width-400,resizemode-4/khaleda-zia.jpg"
