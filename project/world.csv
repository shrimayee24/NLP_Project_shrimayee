Kalamba jail known for poor safety

KOLHAPUR: Five inmates of Kolhapur’s Kalamba Central Jail attacked and killed another 59-year-old inmate convicted in the 1993 Bombay serial blasts case on Sunday morning.Munna — whose known aliases included Mohammad Alikhan and Manojkumar Bhawarlal Gupta — was beaten up with the concrete and metal cover of the drainage chamber near the prison ’s bathing well at 7.55am.CBI had registered a case against Munna at STF police station in Mumbai under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act. He was brought to the Kalamba Central Jail in 2013. Before that, he was lodged in Mumbai’s Arthur Road Jail.The attackers have been identified as Bablu (alias Sandip Shankar Chavan), Pratik (alias Pilya Suresh Patil), Ruturaj (alias Degya Vinayak Inamdar), Sourabh Vikas Sidh and Dipak Netaji Khot. While Bablu, Pratik and Ruturaj have been arrested under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA), Sourabh and Dipak are in judicial custody. On Sunday morning, the five men approached Munna, who had come to the bathing well, and attacked him. Munna suffered deep cuts and started bleeding profusely. One prison worker tried to intervene, but he was also attacked.Swati Sathe, the deputy inspector general (prisons) said: “We are yet to ascertain the motive behind the attack, but the safety of the inmates is our prime concern. There are four convicts of the Bombay serial blast case currently lodged in the Kalamba. For their safety, we will separate them from the regular inmates. If required, we will shift them to other prisons. We will also increase CCTV coverage in the prison.”A case under IPC sections 302 (murder), 353 (assault on public servant), 323 (causing hurt voluntarily), 143 (unlawful assembly), 147 (rioting), 148 (armed rioting), 149 (common object to commit offence) has been registered against the five attackers at the Juna Rajwada police station.The primary investigation has revealed that some animosity had been brewing between the attackers and the deceased for along time.Sanjeevkumar Zade, the inspector of the Juna Rajwada police station, told TOI: “We are going to seek permission from the court to get the attackers’ custody. The motive behind the murder can be known after an investigation.”The Kalamba Central Jail has been mired in controversies over the past couple of years. The authorities have recovered banned narcotic substances such as ganja, mobile phones and SIM cards from inside the prison. Recently, more than 200 cellphones were reco vered from the jail. Amitabh Gupta, director-general (prisons), had dismissed 11 staffers, including two officials, for neglecting safety in the prison.Munna was a habitual absconder and a criminal who had escorted Tiger Memon, the prime accused in the serial blasts, in a four-wheeler from Mumbai to Raigad for the Shekhadi landing of a huge cache of arms, ammunition, hand grenades and RDX before the 1993 blasts. He also helped in its transportation back to Mumbai. He had completed his original 14-year sentence and was out of prison since 2007, when the SC enhanced it to a life term.",Five inmates of Kolhapur’s Kalamba Central Jail attacked and killed another 59-year-old inmate convicted in the 1993 Bombay serial blasts case on Sunday morning.

Donald Trump says Americans could reach 'breaking point' if he is jailed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-says-americans-could-reach-breaking-point-if-he-is-jailed/articleshow/110644251.cms,"WASHINGTON: Donald Trump said he would accept home confinement or jail time after his historic conviction by a New York jury last week but that it would be tough for the public to accept.""I'm not sure the public would stand for it,"" the Republican presidential candidate told Fox News in an interview that aired on Sunday. ""I think it'd be tough for the public to take. You know, at a certain point, there's a breaking point.""Trump did not elaborate on what he thought might happen if that point is reached. He is scheduled to be sentenced July 11, four days before Republicans gather to formally choose their presidential nominee to face Democratic President Joe Biden in November's election.Asked what Trump supporters should do if he were jailed, Republic National Committee Co-Chair Lara Trump told CNN: ""Well, they're gonna do what they've done from the beginning, which is remain calm and protest at the ballot box on November 5th. There's nothing to do other than make your voices heard loud and clear and speak out against this.""Trump has used his conviction to step up his fundraising efforts but has not otherwise sought to mobilize his supporters, in contrast to his comments protesting his 2020 loss to Biden that were followed by an attack by his supporters on January 6, 2021 on the US Capitol.The RNC and the Trump campaign raised $70 million in the 48 hours after the verdict, Lara Trump said, a figure that Reuters was not able to independently verify. Asked how much would be used to pay legal fees versus running the campaign, she declined to say.At least one Democratic lawmaker expressed concern on Sunday about the potential for Trump's supporters to respond violently to his conviction.""His base listens to him. They don't listen to Lara Trump. And this is another dangerous appeal to violence,"" Democratic US Representative Adam Schiff told CNN.But US House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Trump ally, said any response must be lawful.""We are the rule of law party - chaos is not a conservative value. We have to fight back and we will with everything in our arsenal. But we do that within the confines of the rule of law,"" Johnson told ""Fox News Sunday.""Trump has vowed to appeal his conviction by the New York jury, which found him guilty of 34 felony counts over falsifying documents to cover up a payment to silence a porn star ahead of the 2016 election.The matter is unlikely to be resolved before the November presidential election, when he will seek to take back the White House from Biden. Opinion polls show a close race between the two men and suggest that his conviction could hurt him with some Republican voters and independents.Trump attorney Will Scharf told ABC News' ""This Week"" that he does not expect Trump to ""end up being subject to any sentence whatsoever"" and planned to ultimately take the case to the Supreme Court.Trump still faces three other criminal cases, although they are not likely to come to trial before the election. He denies wrongdoing in all the cases and has called the charges a Democratic conspiracy to prevent him from competing.Biden, meanwhile, has sought to defend the nation's justice system, saying it is ""reckless"" and ""dangerous"" to call the verdict ""rigged.""

Zelenskyy in Philippines to promote peace summit he says China and Russia are trying to undermine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/zelenskyy-in-philippines-to-promote-peace-summit-he-says-china-and-russia-are-trying-to-undermine/articleshow/110650526.cms,"MANILA: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was in the Philippines on Monday in a rare Asian trip to urge regional leaders to attend a Swiss-organized global peace summit on the war in Ukraine that he accuses Russia , with China's help, of trying to undermine.Zelenskyy arrived unannounced and under heavy security in Manila late Sunday after speaking over the weekend at the Shangri-La defense forum in Singapore.He had planned but failed to meet with Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on the sidelines of that annual defense gathering and decided to fly here to personally invite Marcos to attend the summit in Switzerland , two Filipino officials told The Associated Press. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because of a lack of authority to discuss details of Zelenskyy's secretive trip to Manila.Both leaders spoke critically of China at the defense forum in Singapore, which was attended by top defense and government officials from around the world, including from Washington and Beijing. The talks were held amid the raging wars in Gaza and Ukraine as well as growing tensions and rivalry for influence between the United States and China in the Indo-Pacific region.At a news conference at the Singapore forum Sunday, Zelenskyy accused China of helping Russia to disrupt the Swiss-organized peace summit by pressuring other countries and their leaders not to attend the talks.""Russia, using Chinese influence in the region, using Chinese diplomats also, does everything to disrupt the peace summit,"" he said without elaborating. ""Regrettably, this is unfortunate that such a big independent powerful country as China is an instrument in the hands of (Russian leader Vladimir) Putin.""The Chinese Foreign Ministry did not respond immediately to a request for comment on Zelenskyy's claim.China has taken what it says is a neutral position on the war, putting it at odds with Ukraine, the U.S. and most of Europe and its trade with Russia has grown, easing the economic impact of Western sanctions. American, Ukrainian and other intelligence agencies say there is evidence that Chinese parts are winding up in Russian weaponry, even if China is not directly arming its neighbor.Switzerland had been hoping China would attend the peace conference in mid-June, but Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning signaled Friday that that was unlikely.At the security forum, Zelenskyy urged top defense officials to participate in the talks in Switzerland, expressing disappointment over the failure of some countries to commit to attending. Ukraine, he said, has proposals to make at the summit as a basis for peace, addressing nuclear security, food security, the release of prisoners of war and the return of Ukrainian children abducted by Russia.Zelenskyy said Ukraine is ""ready to hear various proposals and thoughts that lead us ... to an end of the war and a sustainable and just peace.""U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met with Zelenskyy on the sidelines of the conference and renewed U.S. commitments to Ukraine. In an address to the forum Saturday, Austin said that ""Putin's war of aggression has provided us all with a preview of a world that none of us would want.""Marcos, whose country has had escalating clashes with China over disputed islets in the South China Sea , bluntly underscored the dangers of the regional flashpoint Friday at the defense forum. He said that if ""a willful act"" should result in a Filipino dyring in one of the periodic faceoffs, ""that is, I think, very, very close to what we define as an act of war.""""That would certainly increase the level of response,"" Marcos said in response to a question.Marcos restated earlier concerns over a new law issued by China giving its coast guard license to seize foreign ships ""that illegally enter China's territorial waters"" and to detain foreign crews for up to 60 days. The same law made new reference to 2021 legislation that says China's coast guard can fire on foreign ships if necessary.""Illegal, coercive, aggressive and deceptive actions continue to violate our sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdictions,"" Marcos said, without naming China, but he added the Philippines remained committed to a peaceful resolution of the disputes.Austin said at the forum that U.S. commitment to the Philippines as a treaty ally is ""ironclad"" but reiterated the importance of dialogue with China.""There are a number of things that can happen at sea or in the air, we recognize that,"" he said. ""But our goal is to make sure that we don't allow things to spiral out of control unnecessarily.""",Zelenskyy arrived unannounced and under heavy security in Manila late Sunday.

Stormy Daniels says Trump should be jailed after conviction,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/stormy-daniels-says-trump-should-be-jailed-after-conviction/articleshow/110649410.cms,"'Intimidating'

'Vicious' atmosphere

LONDON: Stormy Daniels , the adult film actor, broke her silence after former US president Donald Trump 's conviction to say he should be jailed, in an interview published in British tabloid The Mirror at the weekend.""I think he should be sentenced to jail and some community service working for the less fortunate, or being the volunteer punching bag at a women's shelter,"" Daniels said in the interview, published late on Saturday.A jury of 12 New Yorkers on Thursday found Trump guilty on 34 counts of business fraud for trying to cover up hush money payments to Daniels on the eve of the 2016 presidential election .Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, was paid $130,000 to keep silent and prevent scandal from breaking ahead of the election, in which Trump narrowly defeated Hillary Clinton After years of exchanging insults with Trump on social media, Daniels now says she finally has been ""vindicated"", although she was ""shocked"" at how quickly the jury made a decision -- one that made Trump the first ever former US president to be convicted of a crime.Daniels also accused the White House hopeful of being ""completely and utterly out of touch with reality"" and compared him to a child at one point in the interview.The former adult film actor and director helped bring Trump down in court with her gripping testimony, which included graphic descriptions of what she says was a casual sexual encounter in 2006.""Being in court was so intimidating with the jurors looking at you,"" she said in the Mirror interview, adding that she was glad it was proved that she had been ""telling the truth the entire time"".""It's not over for me. It's never going to be over for me. Trump may be guilty, but I still have to live with the legacy.""The 45-year-old had remained uncharacteristically quiet in the days following the Thursday conviction.Daniels's husband Barrett Blade had previously told CNN that she was ""still processing"" the trial. He suggested that she could be threatened by Trump 's supporters.""You know, all the MAGA idiots are going to be coming after her,"" Blade said, referring to Trump's Make America Great Again movement.Daniels also said she would never escape death threats from Trump's supporters, the Mirror reported.""It's so vicious and threatening... from the standpoint of just the fear of what somebody might do,"" Daniels's lawyer Clark Brewster said of the atmosphere around the trial in an interview with a local ABC News channel.Daniels is a self-made woman who rose from a difficult childhood and through the challenging world of adult movies to become a successful businesswoman.But in a recent documentary, she revealed that behind her outwardly tough, humorous persona on social media, she has been hurt by the constant insults from Trump and his supporters.""Back in 2018 that was stuff like 'liar', 'slut', 'gold digger',"" she said in the film, ""Stormy"".""This time around, it is very different. It is direct threats, it is, 'I'm going to come to your house and slit your throat', 'your daughter should be euthanised'.""The trial and its revelations have added to tensions in the already bitterly divided country.On Friday, Trump launched into a stream of insults and non-factual claims, lashing out that the trial and the judge who presided over it.His campaign on Friday said that it had raised nearly $53 million in online donations after the conviction, boasting that the verdict had boosted his support ""like never before"".Trump is due for sentencing on July 11 but is expected to appeal the verdict. He potentially faces a prison sentence but is much more likely to receive probation.","Stormy Daniels says former US president Donald Trump should be jailed. Daniels says she has been ""vindicated"" by her testimony against Trump. Trump was found guilty on 34 counts of business fraud on Thursday. Daniels was paid $130,000 to keep silent about an alleged affair with Trump in 2006.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110649443,imgsize-1141630,width-400,resizemode-4/110649443.jpg"
Ceasefire or political survival? Gaza plan puts Bibi in a spot,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/ceasefire-or-political-survival-gaza-plan-puts-bibi-in-a-spot/articleshow/110649298.cms,"For months, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu has refused to offer a timeline for ending the war against Hamas in Gaza , a reticence that his critics see as a political tactic. But he has been put on the spot this weekend by US Prez Biden 's announcement outlining a proposal for a truce.Netanyahu, a conservative, has long juggled competing personal, political and national interests. He now appears to be facing a stark choice between the survival of his hardline, hawkish govt and bringing home hostages held in Gaza while setting himself and Israel on a new course away from growing global isolation.Critics of the PM say there are two Netanyahus: one who functions pragmatically in the war cabinet he formed with some centrist rivals, boosting its public legitimacy; and another who is being held hostage by the far-right members of his coalition, who oppose any concession to Hamas and who ensure his political survival.Biden on Friday outlined broad terms that he said were presented by Israel to the American, Qatari and Egyptian mediators who have been pushing for a deal to pause the fighting. Israeli officials confirmed that the terms matched a ceasefire proposal that had been greenlit by Israel's war cabinet but not yet presented to the Israeli public. Now, analysts say, it is crunchtime for Netanyahu, or Bibi, as he is popularly known. Biden ""booted Netanyahu out of the closet of ambiguity and presented Netanyahu's proposal himself,"" Ben Caspit, a longtime critic of the PM, told a Hebrew daily.Members of two far-right parties in the coalition - Bezalel Smotrich, Israel's minister of finance, and Itamar Ben-Gvir, the national security minister - have explicitly threatened to bring Netanyahu's govt down if the PM goes along with the deal outlined by Biden before Hamas is fully destroyed. Some hardline members of Netanyahu's own Likud party have said they will join them.At the same time, Benny Gantz and Gadi Eisenkot, two former military chiefs who joined the emergency govt for the duration of the war, have threatened to withdraw the support of their centrist National Unity party by June 8 if Netanyahu fails to come up with a clear path forward. And opposition parties have begun organising to try to topple the govt.The ceasefire proposal involves three phases. They would see tranches of hostages released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails; a temporary ceasefire would turn into a permanent cessation of hostilities, with the third phase involving an internationally backed bid to rehabilitate Gaza. An estimated 125 hostages, living and dead, are still held in Gaza.Ophir Falk, the chief foreign policy adviser to Netanyahu, told UK's Sunday Times that Biden's proposal was ""a deal we agreed to."" Adding that many details still had to be worked out, he said, ""It's not a good deal but we dearly want the hostages released, all of them."" Israelis were left to parse the two statements that Netanyahu's office put out: They neither forcefully endorsed the proposal nor denied that it had been presented to the mediators. Instead, they were conditional - seemingly designed to leave Netanyahu's options open.","US Prez Biden outlined broad terms that he said were presented by Israel to the American, Qatari and Egyptian mediators.

Dark plumes of smoke traveled high into the sky over the fire area comprised mostly of grassy hills.Early Sunday, the blaze appeared to be growing, fueled by hot and dry conditions in California. Cal Fire updated the size of the fire to 19.5 square miles (50.5 square kilometers), up from 17.2 square miles (44.5 square kilometers) late Saturday.The fire was 15 percent contained as of Sunday morning, the Cal Fire Santa Clara Unit said in a Facebook post that strong winds and dry grass ""have made it difficult for firefighters to contain.""Chief Baraka Carter said two fire workers were injured, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.Interstate 580, which connects the San Francisco Bay Area to San Joaquin County in central California, was closed from the Alameda County line to the Stanislaus County Line. SR 132 was also closed from I-580 to SR 33 due to the wildfire, the California Department of Transportation said in a statement.The San Joaquin County Office of Emergency Services issued an evacuation order for areas west of the California Aqueduct, south of Corral Hollow Creek, west to Alameda County and south to Stanislaus County. A temporary evacuation point was established at Larch Clover Community Center in Tracy.Sunday's high temperature for Tracy was expected to reach 85 degrees Fahrenheit (29 degrees Celsius), with no rain in the forecast, but hotter conditions are on their way.The National Weather Service said ""dangerously hot conditions"" with highs of 103 F to 108 F (39.4 C to 42.2 C) were expected later in the week for San Joaquin Valley, an area that encompasses the city of Tracy. Wind gusts of up to 45 mph (72 kph) lashed the region Saturday night, according to meteorologist Idamis Shoemaker of the NWS Sacramento.The wildfire was near the Lawrence Livermore laboratory's Site 300 southwest of Tracy, Cal Fire said in a social media post late Saturday.Lawrence Livermore is a research and development institution primarily focusing on the US nuclear weapons stockpile.

Parade for Israel in NYC focuses on solidarity this year as Gaza war casts a grim shadow,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/parade-for-israel-in-nyc-focuses-on-solidarity-this-year-as-gaza-war-casts-a-grim-shadow/articleshow/110644489.cms,"NEW YORK: An annual New York City parade for Israel that draws thousands of people kicked off Sunday with heightened security and a focus on solidarity during the war in Gaza.The parade comes almost eight months after the unprecedented Oct. 7 attack by Hamas , the deadliest in Israel's history. The parade in the past was dubbed ""Celebrate Israel,"" but organizers said the exuberant atmosphere would be paused this year given the war and Israeli hostages still being held in captivity, as well as outbursts of antisemitism worldwide.People chanted ""Bring them home now!"" and waved Israeli flags as they marched along Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. Crowds of spectators lined the route of what this year is being called ""Israel Day on Fifth.""Mark Treyger, CEO of the Jewish Community Relations Council, said earlier this week that the event would focus on solidarity, strength and resilience.""This is not a mood of confetti and music,"" Treyger said. ""This is more of a mood of unwavering, ironclad solidarity with hostages to bring them home, and also our unwavering love and pride in our Jewish identity.""The parade, which is in its 59th year, kicked off at about 11:30 a.m. Sunday and was expected to draw more than 40,000 participants, including Israeli dignitaries, celebrities and some of the hostages' families.There was never a thought of canceling the parade this year, Treyger said, despite what he termed an astronomical rise in antisemitism.""This is a moment that we have to meet,"" he said.But there was significant security.New York Police Department officials said Friday they plan to implement measures typically used for high-profile events such as New Year's Eve and July 4. That includes drones, K-9 units, bike patrols, fencing and barriers and designated entry points for spectators all along the parade route.Backpacks, large bags and coolers will be prohibited. Spectators will have to pass through metal detectors and only be allowed to line the east side of Fifth Avenue, with police blocking off the west side.City officials stressed Friday there were no specific or credible threats to either the parade or the city and any protestors have the right to demonstrate so long as its done peacefully.""We're not going to allow any unlawfulness and any disruption of any celebration of one's heritage in this city,"" New York City Mayor Eric Adams said at a security briefing.The parade represents the first large-scale Jewish event in the city since the war started, although there have been roughly 2,800 protests in the city, with about 1,300 of them related to the conflict, the Democrat said.Israel faces growing international criticism for its strategy of systematic destruction in Gaza, at a huge cost in civilian lives. Israeli bombardments and ground offensives in the besieged territory have killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians.","The parade comes almost eight months after the unprecedented Oct. 7 attack by Hamas.

NEW DELHI: Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump quickly received a million followers on TikTok within hours of joining the platform on Sunday. As president, Trump had attempted to ban the short video social media platform on national security grounds.Trump's decision to join TikTok aims to reach younger voters in his third bid for the White House. He faces a close race with Democratic incumbent Joe Biden ahead of the November 5 presidential elections.Trump posted a launch video on his account @realdonaldtrump, on Saturday night. The video shows Trump greeting fans at an Ultimate Fighting Championship event in Newark, New Jersey.Biden's campaign is already active on TikTok eventhough Biden has signed a bill that would ban the app, used by 170 million Americans, if its Chinese owner ByteDance fails to divest it.ByteDance is challenging in court the law requiring it to sell TikTok by next January or face a ban. The White House seeks to end Chinese-based ownership on national security grounds. TikTok argues it will not share US user data with the Chinese government and has taken measures to protect user privacy.Trump's 2020 attempt to ban TikTok was blocked by the courts. In March, he called the platform a national security threat but said a ban would hurt young people and strengthen Meta Platforms' Facebook, which he has criticized.Trump has a significant social media presence with over 87 million followers on X and more than 7 million followers on his platform, Truth Social.Last week, a US appeals court established a fast-track schedule to review the legal challenges against the new law. The US Court of Appeals for the district of Columbia scheduled oral arguments for September. This decision came after TikTok, ByteDance, a group of TikTok content creators, and the justice department jointly requested a fast-tracked timeline earlier this month.","Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump quickly received a million followers on TikTok.

The uploads also included pictures of Pakistan’s current civilian and military leaderships and alleged they stole the mandate of the Imran-led Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) in general elections this Feb.“Every Pakistani should study the Hamoodur Rahman Commission Report and get to know who was the true traitor, General Yahya Khan or Sheikh Mujibur Rahman,” said a quote attributed to Imran.The commission had probed Pakistan’s political-military involvement in East-Pakistan --- current-day Bangladesh --- from 1947 to 1971. The video referred to purported crimes by the Pakistani military during the civil war in East Pakistan and claimed former military dictator General Yahya was responsible.Strong backlash followed the posts, especially from government ranks who called it “alarming” and accused PTI of fuelling a narrative of “hatred and incitement” by drawing comparisons between Imran and Mujib.On Friday, Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) officials visited the prison where Imran has been kept to quiz him over the post but he refused to meet them without lawyers. FIA has sent a notice to Imran on the matter.This was followed by a meeting of army commanders, which vowed to defeat what it termed “digital terrorism” by trying to induce despondency and sowing discord by peddling “blatant lies, fake news, and propaganda”. “The nation is fully cognisant of their ugly and ulterior motives and the designs of these nefarious forces,” General Munir was quoted army’s media wing as saying.Imran’s PTI had until recently been trying to disassociate itself from the controversial posts but “owned” them on his directions. A meeting of PTI’s core committee was held on Friday. “Hamoodur Rehman Commission Report must be made public to avoid 1971 like grave challenges, learn a lesson from the past and apprise the people about what exactly happened in 1971,” PTI said in a statement after the meeting.The statement then sought to draw a parallel between 1970 and the current situation in Pakistan. “In 1971 debacle, the most important aspect was rejection of the people’s mandate, which is also presently prevailing in the country,” PTI said.",The posts were uploaded by Imran’s social media team last week on his X account.

NEW DELHI: A Pakistan government lawyer admitted before Islamabad high court that Pakistan-Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK) is not a part of their country. His statements were made in the case of poet and journalist Ahmed Farhad Shah, who the lawyer said cannot be brought to the federal capital for court proceedings from PoJK, as he was in 'foreign territory' that does not come under the country's jurisdiction.During the session, additional attorney general Munawar Iqbal Duggal said that Farhad faced charges in PoK and was in custody until June 2. Duggal mentioned that Farhad's family had met him, suggesting that the habeas corpus petition should be dismissed.Presiding over the proceedings, Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani considered the plea filed by Arooj Zainab, Farhad's spouse, as reported by Dunya News.Petitioner's counsel Imaan Mazari emphasised that her client sought not only her husband's return but also action against those responsible for his enforced disappearance.The HC emphasised that the case would only conclude upon Farhad's appearance in court.AAG Duggal argued that PoJK, with its own constitution and courts, was considered foreign territory. Judgments from Pakistani courts were treated akin to those from foreign courts, as per Dunya News.The petitioner's attorney informed the court that Farhad's family had traveled from Islamabad to the Dhirkot police station but were told upon arrival that he had been moved to Muzaffarabad due to terrorism-related charges. When questioned about Farhad's whereabouts before his May 29 detention, the Islamabad prosecutor general deferred to the PoK court.Justice Kayani remarked that everyone should work within the law, to which the prosecutor general maintained that he works within the law, reported Dunya News.""We have to determine the misuse of law,"" Kayani said to the petitioner's attorney's argument that the court should also consider cases involving the misuse of laws and procedures.The court adjourned the hearing of the case until June 7, rejecting the request to dispose of the petition for the recovery of poet Ahmed Farhad.","Pakistan government lawyer admitted before Islamabad high court that Pakistan- Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK) is not a part of their country.

The Financial Times reported Friday that Jon Benjamin was traveling in Sinaloa and Durango, two states in northern Mexico where drug cartels have a significant presence, when the incident occurred. The video posted on the social media platform X shows a man who looks like Benjamin seated in the front seat of a vehicle, when he picks up the supposed rifle and points it at someone in the back seat. The five-second clip was posted by an anonymous user along with the message, “In a context of daily killings in Mexico by drug dealers, he dares to joke.”

While the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office hasn't officially announced any changes at the embassy in Mexico City, the FCDO website no longer lists Benjamin as ambassador.

“We are aware of this incident and have taken appropriate action,"" the Foreign Office said in a statement released in response to questions about the reported incident. “Where internal issues do arise the FCDO has robust HR processes to address them.”
