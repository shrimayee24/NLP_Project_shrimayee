"Naim Qassem, Hezbollah's new chief",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/who-is-naim-qassem-hezbollahs-new-chief/articleshow/114738707.cms,"Naim Qassem.

Who is Naim Qassem?

Born in Beirut in 1953 to a family from the border village of Kfar Fila , Sheikh Naim Qassem began his political journey with the Lebanese Shi'ite Amal Movement, a Hezbollah ally.

He left Amal in 1979 after the Islamic revolution in Iran which was a precursor to the formation of Hezbollah three years later.

Qassem was appointed deputy chief of Hezbollah in 1991 by Abbas al-Musawi, the then-leader of Hezbollah who was killed the following year in an Israeli helicopter strike. Qassem continued in this position after Nasrallah became leader, serving as one of Hezbollah’s primary spokespersons, especially during recent escalations with Israel.

Since 1992, he has coordinated Hezbollah’s parliamentary election campaigns

He is also the author of a 2005 book providing an inside look into the group.

He was the most senior Hezbollah official to make public appearances after Nasrallah largely went into hiding following the group's 2006 war with Israel.

Qassem wears a white turban unlike Nasrallah and Safieddine, whose black turbans denoted their status as descendants of the Prophet Muhammad.

Lebanon 's Hezbollah militant group on Tuesday announced that it has elected Sheikh Naim Qassem , a long-time leader within the Iran-backed Lebanese group, as its new head. The decision to elect Naim Qassem, previously serving as deputy leader, as the group's head comes following secretary general Hassan Nasrallah 's death in an Israeli attack in southern Beirut a few weeks ago.Qassem, who has been part of Hezbollah’s senior leadership for over 30 years, gave a televised address on October 8 from an undisclosed location. In his speech, he described the conflict with Israel as a ""war about who cries first"" and affirmed that Hezbollah would not be the first to cry. He noted that, despite suffering “painful blows” from Israel, Hezbollah’s capabilities remain intact.For the first time, Qassem expressed support for efforts by Hezbollah ally and parliamentary speaker Nabih Berri to broker a ceasefire, omitting a previous condition that a Gaza truce must precede halting Hezbollah’s attacks on Israel.The 30-minute broadcast came soon after a reported Israeli strike that allegedly targeted senior Hezbollah figure Hashem Safieddine, and 11 days after the death of Hezbollah secretary general Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah in an Israeli attack. Hezbollah confirmed Safieddine’s death on October 23.","Sheikh Naim Qassem has been part of Hezbollah’s senior leadership for over 30 years.

In a candid exchange, Harris quipped, “Oh, we have microphones and listening to everything. I didn't realise that. Okay, you'll bleep my F words. We just told all the family secrets.”The vice president’s visit to the popular bar came on the first day of early in-person voting in Michigan, as over 1.4 million ballots had already been submitted.

""I want to have whatever she's having,"" Harris declared, raising her glass in a toast with Whitmer, who proudly shared the origins of the Oberon beer: “It's made right here in Kalamazoo, which many are calling Kamalazoo. Okay. Cheers.”Earlier that day, Harris had visited a doctor's office in nearby Portage, where she discussed the impacts of restrictive abortion laws with health care providers and students. “We are looking at a health care crisis in America that is affecting people of every background and gender,"" she noted, emphasising the urgent need for support in reproductive health care.The event with Harris and Obama was designed to energise the Democratic base as the party seeks to overcome challenges posed by a close race against Republican nominee Donald Trump. Despite a high-profile campaign featuring celebrities like Beyoncé and Bruce Springsteen, Harris faces the daunting task of converting star power into votes. Trump, during a rally, mocked her approach, stating, “Kamala is at a dance party with Beyoncé,” as he campaigned in Michigan.As the election season heats up, President Joe Biden, also active on the campaign trail, talked about Harris's dedication to labour rights, saying she once walked a picket line with the United Auto Workers.

Sean 'Diddy' Combs is facing a new lawsuit for sexually assaulting a 10-year-old boy in 2005, adding to the existing list of hundreds of rape allegations against him.The lawsuit is one of two filed on Monday in a Manhattan state court by attorney Tony Buzbee , who represents over 150 alleged victims of Combs and has filed at least 17 lawsuits against him.In the complaint involving the 10-year-old, a California plaintiff identified as John Doe claims he was an aspiring actor and rapper when a consultant arranged an ""audition"" with Combs at a New York hotel.According to the suit, after Doe said he would “do anything” to succeed, Combs allegedly gave him a drugged soda, pushed him down, and forced him to perform oral sex.The plaintiff said he lost consciousness, waking up sore with his pants undone. He also said that Combs threatened to harm his family if he told anyone.In Monday's second lawsuit, another male accuser said he was a 17-year-old auditioning for the reality TV show 'Making the Band' in 2008 when Combs and a bodyguard allegedly assaulted him.In this complaint, another California plaintiff identified as John Doe said that Combs forced him to perform oral sex on both himself and the bodyguard, presenting it as a ""test"" of his dedication to the music industry.According to the suit, Doe was ultimately rejected from the audition after Combs deemed him ""untrustworthy"" for expressing reservations about the assault.Combs' lawyers responded with a statement similar to those issued after previous lawsuits from Buzbee, saying, ""The attorney behind this lawsuit is more interested in media attention than in the truth. In court, the truth will prevail: Mr. Combs has never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone—man or woman, adult or minor.""Diddy has been held at Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Detention Center since his arrest on September 16. He faces charges of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking , and transportation for prostitution, involving over 120 alleged victims, including his ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura.

TOI Correspondent from Washington:

MAGA Supremo Donald Trump asserted on Monday that he is the ""opposite of a Nazi"" as reverberations from a vile and toxic rally he headlined at Madison Square Garden on Sunday continued to rattle the US political arena.""The newest line from Kamala and her campaign is that everyone who isn't voting for her is a Nazi,"" Trump told a typically raucous rally in Atlanta, fabricating an attribution to his opponent. ""I'm not a Nazi. I'm the opposite of a Nazi,"" he added, going on to accuse Harris of being a ""fascist,"" which is what some of his own former aides have called him.Trump and some of his allies were visibly rattled by the shock and revulsion Sunday's MSG rally caused across the political spectrum, with some speakers using filthy, vitriolic language to denigrate Kamala Harris and minorities. Many commentators pointed to the use of extremist symbols, idioms, and language to argue the gathering was redolent of a neo-Nazi rally.Political analysts also noted the use at the rally of the song Dixie, which is considered by many as a Confederate anthem celebrating slavery and secession, but which is cherished by some conservatives as an ode to Southern pride. The song is banned in many institutions because it is evocative of a racist America that condoned slavery.While the Trump campaign regretted the crass joke by a comedian who referred to Puerto Rico as “a floating island of garbage,” it notably made no comment on other offensive jibes about Latinos, Black Americans, Jews, and Muslims, and coarse and vulgar references to Kamala Harris.""These Latinos, they love making babies, too.....There’s no pulling out. They don’t do that. They come inside, just like they did to our country,” the comedian Peter Hinchcliffe said at the rally in a ""joke"" resonant with Trump's charge that immigrants are ""poisoning the blood of our country.""While there has been much commentary on which demographic -- women, blacks, Muslim-Americans, Jewish Americans, Indian-Americans etc -- could tilt the elections one way or the other, immediate attention is now on Latinos, particularly Puerto Ricans, who form an influential voting bloc in many states.Fortunately for the Trump campaign, nearly 50 million Americans -- about 30 per cent of the expected turnout -- have already voted in early polling. But the fiasco still leaves it vulnerable in what is being called an ""October surprise"" which could be a setback or turnaround in a presidential campaign.The Harris campaign and its liberal and moderate supporters are furiously pounding the issue as both sides wheel out polls and cherrypick surveys showing them ahead, even as they gear up for a electoral gridlock and legal challenges on November 5/6. Many political mavens fear that November 6 could be the new January 6 when Trump stormtroopers besieged the US Capitol to protest a process that formalized a Biden victory in the 2020 election.In an effort to draw a contrast with that event, Kamala Harris is holding a rally on Tuesday evening at the Ellipse, which is diametrically opposite to the Capitol, and where Trump's provocative speech on January 6 let loose his MAGA mob on the seat of US legislature. Harris aides say she will lay out in clear terms her vision for the future, warning that a second Trump presidency would be more dangerous than the first because he would be ""more unhinged and more unchecked.""","'I'm not a Nazi.

Jeff Bezos defends Washington Post’s decision as paper faces subscriber backlash: Presidential endorsements,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/presidential-endorsements-jeff-bezos-defends-washington-posts-decision-as-paper-faces-subscriber-backlash/articleshow/114737969.cms,"According to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post the media is facing a fall in credibility, and endorsing a presidential candidate will only create a perception of non-independence.

Catch up quick

The Washington Post’s announcement marked a notable shift. Historically, the editorial board has endorsed Democratic candidates, but this year, as Republican Donald Trump faces Democrat Kamala Harris , it opted for neutrality.

, it opted for neutrality. The Washington Post cited a need to reduce perceived bias as a reason for abstaining from endorsements.

The paper's decision has resulted in the cancellation of over 200,000 subscriptions, representing 8% of its total circulation.

Notable resignations followed the announcement, including three members of the editorial board and prominent columnists.

Bezos expressed regret over the timing, acknowledging the decision's proximity to the election had unintended consequences.

What They’re Saying

The decision sparked immediate backlash from journalists and subscribers. Critics argue that refraining from endorsing a candidate is itself a political statement, possibly appeasing former President Trump, who has often criticized Bezos and the Washington Post. Bezos countered that the decision wasn’t an effort to protect Amazon or other business interests, insisting it was based purely on principle.

Former editor Marty Baron denounced the decision, describing it as “cowardice, with democracy as its casualty.” Similarly, columnists Robert Kagan and Michele Norris resigned, citing disagreements with the paper’s direction.

Zoom in: Bezos’s defense

Bezos argued that the media’s role as a credible, independent voice is critical, especially in an era where misinformation on social media can drive polarization.

He noted that presidential endorsements contribute to a “perception of non-independence” that undermines public trust.

Bezos wrote: “What presidential endorsements actually do is create a perception of bias. A perception of non-independence. Ending them is a principled decision, and it’s the right one.”

He emphasized that the Washington Post, along with other news institutions, must adapt to this credibility crisis by making difficult choices to rebuild trust.

Polling and public commentary reflect a deep-rooted skepticism among Americans, who view media endorsements as less about informing the public and more about wielding influence.

Bezos highlighted the dwindling public trust in media, pointing out that journalism has often ranked at the bottom in surveys of public confidence. A recent Gallup poll even placed it below Congress, which has historically had one of the lowest trust ratings.

Bezos sees this loss of credibility as a pressing issue, likening it to a voting machine that not only needs to count votes accurately but also to be believed by voters as accurate. He believes that eliminating presidential endorsements, which can be construed as partial, is a step toward repairing this trust.

""Presidential endorsements do nothing to tip the scales of an election,” Bezos asserted. “What they actually do is create a perception of bias. A perception of non-independence. Ending them is a principled decision, and it’s the right one.”

Bezos’ “complexifier”: A wealthy media owner’s challenges

While Bezos claims that his influence on the editorial staff is minimal, he acknowledges that his vast business interests make him a “complexifier” for the Post. Amazon and Blue Origin, companies he founded and owns, have substantial dealings with the US government, raising inevitable questions about potential conflicts of interest. Bezos is aware that his presence can complicate perceptions of the Post’s neutrality, and he has publicly invited readers to examine his track record since acquiring the paper in 2013.

For Bezos, the issue of media credibility is not solely a Washington Post problem but an industry-wide crisis. In an era of fake news and misinformation, where social media can disseminate unverified information faster than traditional news outlets, the stakes are too high for maintaining public trust in established media. “Many of the finest journalists you’ll find anywhere work at The Washington Post, and they work painstakingly every day to get to the truth,” Bezos wrote, underscoring the importance of the paper’s role in providing credible news.

A broader trend across the US media

The Washington Post is not alone in rethinking its role in political endorsements. Over the years, the number of newspapers endorsing presidential candidates has steadily decreased.

In 2008, nearly all major newspapers chose between the two main candidates, but by 2020, fewer than 55 of the largest papers made such endorsements.

With readership becoming increasingly polarized, many media owners fear alienating half their audience by supporting a candidate.

It’s a stance that can shield their publications from accusations of partisanship but has also invited criticism from loyal subscribers who expect guidance on issues of national importance.

Some media analysts, like Rick Edmonds from the Poynter Institute, told AP that endorsements have become a liability in today’s environment. “They really don’t want to rattle or anger people who are not going to like their endorsement,” Edmonds said. This shift towards neutrality, however, is not universally accepted by audiences. After the Post’s announcement, former subscribers openly expressed frustration, viewing the non-endorsement as a betrayal of journalistic principles.

The big picture context on media trust

This erosion of trust is a problem that affects more than just the Washington Post. Bezos highlighted how people increasingly turn to alternative sources—unvetted social media posts, opinionated podcasts, and partisan news sites—which frequently spread misinformation. Bezos contends that these choices fragment public discourse and drive divisive narratives, a trend that threatens the role of fact-based journalism.

In his note, he reflected: “Voting machines must meet two requirements. They must count the vote accurately, and people must believe they count the vote accurately. The second requirement is distinct from and just as important as the first.” The same, he argued, applies to news organizations. For the Washington Post to succeed as a credible news source, it needs readers to trust not only its accuracy but also its independence.

According to a Gallup poll, the American public's trust in the news media has reached an all-time low, with the institution ranking at the bottom among 10 key civic and political entities that play a role in the democratic process. The legislative branch of the federal government, which includes the US Senate and House of Representatives, fares only slightly better, with a mere 34% of the population expressing trust in its abilities.

The way forward

The Washington Post’s decision to step back from endorsements is a high-stakes gamble in an industry fighting to preserve relevance and credibility. Bezos, for his part, has staked his reputation on what he believes is a principled approach to journalism. But for many readers and even Post employees, the decision feels like a retreat, a step away from the courage that has historically defined the paper.

As the fallout continues, it’s clear that Bezos’ path to restoring trust in the media will not be easy. The modern audience is more fragmented and wary than ever, and while some may applaud the Post’s neutral stance, others view it as abandonment.

When The Washington Post , one of America’s most influential newspapers, announced that it would not endorse a candidate in the upcoming presidential election , the decision was met with polarized responses. Jeff Bezos , the billionaire owner of The Washington Post, defended this decision, calling it “principled” and the “right” one.However, the Washington Post's decision to halt endorsements wasn’t isolated; it aligns with a broader trend as newspapers, including the Los Angeles Times, re-evaluate their role in the political sphere.(With inputs from agencies)","The Washington Post announced it would not endorse a presidential candidate. Jeff Bezos, who owns the paper, said the decision was based purely on principle. The decision has resulted in the cancellation of over 200,000 subscriptions, representing 8% of the paper's circulation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114738028,imgsize-12132,width-400,resizemode-4/114738028.jpg"

A 15-year-old high school student from Grand Junction , Colorado, is in the hospital with severe complications from food poisoning after consuming McDonald’s Quarter Pounder hamburgers multiple times before a deadly E. coli outbreak was detected.Kamberlyn Bowler was flown 250 miles to a hospital near Denver in mid-October. She underwent dialysis for 10 days in an attempt to save her kidneys.She is one of at least 75 people who fell ill and one of 22 hospitalized due to the outbreak, which is tentatively linked to contaminated onions used in the hamburgers. Mesa County, where Kamberlyn resides, reported 11 illnesses and one death. Federal health officials believe the slivered onions on the burgers are a likely source of the outbreak.Kamberlyn’s mother, Brittany Randall, expressed distress over her daughter’s condition and the broader implications of food safety. ""It's pretty scary to know that we put so much faith and trust that we're going to be eating something that's healthy and for it to be broken,"" she said.Randall plans to sue the fast-food chain after Kamberlyn contracted the E. coli O157:H7 bacteria confirmed in the outbreak, which can cause severe kidney disease complications. According to medical experts, the bacteria can lead to a condition known as hemolytic uremic syndrome.Randall, who works as a jail guard and has three older children, initially thought Kamberlyn had the flu. When Kamberlyn reported blood in her stool, urine, and vomiting blood, Randall realized the situation was serious.On Oct. 11, Kamberlyn visited a hospital in Grand Junction but was sent home with a likely stomach bug diagnosis and instructions to stay hydrated. By Oct. 17, her condition had worsened, and further tests indicated acute kidney failure . She was then flown to Children’s Hospital Colorado in Aurora.Randall is uncertain about her daughter’s future health and the associated medical costs. “The hospital bills are racking up,” she said. “And I'm a single mom and I just don't know that I can necessarily afford all of what's coming after all of this. And I don't know what the future looks like, either.""",Kamberlyn Bowler was flown 250 miles to a hospital near Denver in mid-October.

'Trump’s vision of fear and division not who we are': What Kamala Harris said in her 'closing argument' before election,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-vision-of-fear-and-division-not-who-we-are-what-kamala-harris-said-in-her-closing-argument-before-election/articleshow/114754581.cms,"'A new generation of leadership'

Vice President Kamala Harris delivered a speech one week before Election Day , aiming to draw a stark contrast between her vision for America and that of former President Donald Trump . Speaking from the Ellipse near the White House — the same area where Trump addressed supporters ahead of the January 6 Capitol attack — Harris warned voters about the dangers of returning to a Trump presidency, casting him as a divisive figure obsessed with power. “America, I am here tonight to say: That’s not who we are.”Reflecting on Trump’s past actions, particularly his conduct on January 6, Harris reminded voters of his role in the Capitol insurrection and his continued divisive rhetoric. “Look, we know who Donald Trump is. He is the person who stood at this very spot nearly four years ago and sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol to overturn the will of the people in a free and fair election,” she said.Harris sought to frame herself as a leader for a “new generation,” committed to turning the page on political drama, conflict, and division. “It doesn’t have to be this way,” she told the audience, advocating for a shift away from partisanship and towards unity. “We have to stop pointing fingers and start locking arms,” she added, calling for a renewed sense of national purpose that transcends political divisions.Harris said that she will prioritise practical issues that affect Americans’ daily lives, contrasting this with Trump’s focus on personal grievances. “Unlike Donald Trump, I don’t believe people who disagree with me are the enemy,” she said. “He wants to put them in jail. I’ll give them a seat at my table. And I pledge to be a president for all Americans, to always put country above party and above self.”Her speech included specific promises for her potential administration, addressing issues like economic fairness, security, and immigration. “When I am president, we will quickly remove those who arrive here unlawfully, prosecute the cartels, and give border patrol the support they need,” she promised, aiming to offer a balanced approach to immigration reform.Reflecting on Trump’s vision for America, Harris described it as one rooted in discord and hostility. “Donald Trump is unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and out for unchecked power,” she said.","Vice President Kamala Harris delivered a speech one week before Election Day.

Biden’s comments came in response to a controversial remark made at a Trump rally, where comedian Tony Hinchcliffe described Puerto Rico as a “floating island of garbage.”Biden condemned the remarks, saying, “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters. His demonisation of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American. It’s totally contrary to everything we've done, everything we’ve been.” He added that Trump “doesn’t give a damn about the Latino community,” and encouraged voters to “reject [Trump]” in the upcoming election.Biden’s strong language quickly drew a response from Republicans, including Trump himself. At a campaign stop, Trump likened Biden’s words to Hillary Clinton’s 2016 comments about Trump supporters being a “basket of deplorables,” a term that has since become a rallying cry among his base. “Remember Hillary? She said ‘deplorable’… and ‘irredeemable.’ Garbage, I think, is worse, right?” Trump said, drawing laughter from supporters.Trump's running mate JD Vance, also condemned Biden’s comments, calling them “disgusting.” He accused Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris of “attacking half of the country.”Democrats, meanwhile, faced internal pressures to distance themselves from Biden’s remarks. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro said on CNN that he “would never insult the good people of Pennsylvania or any Americans, even if they chose to support a candidate that I didn’t support.”The controversy highlighted the intensifying battle for Hispanic voters , with both parties working to shore up support among this increasingly influential demographic.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan began a nationwide vaccination campaign Monday to protect 45 million children from polio after a surge in new cases that has hampered years of efforts to stop the disease in one of the two countries where it has never been eradicated.Pakistan regularly launches such campaigns, but violence targeting the health workers and police assigned to escort them is common. Militants falsely claim the vaccination campaigns are a Western conspiracy to sterilize children.The campaign is the third this year and will continue until Sunday ""in response to the alarming increase in polio cases,"" said Ayesha Raza Farooq , the prime minister's adviser for the polio eradication program. ""We are re-energized in our efforts to combat polio,"" she said in a statement.During the door-to-door campaign, children younger than 5 will be vaccinated and given drops of Vitamin A supplements to enhance their immunity.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif recently met with front-line health workers, urging them to ensure no child was left unvaccinated by going door-to-door.Anwarul Haq, who is the coordinator of the National Emergency Operations Centre for Polio Eradication, also urged parents to fully cooperate with polio workers. ""Polio has no cure, but it can be prevented with this readily available vaccine,"" he said.Pakistan has recorded 41 cases across 71 districts so far this year, Farooq said. Most were reported from southwestern Balochistan and southern Sindh province, following by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and eastern Punjab province.The surge in cases in new locations is worrying authorities since previous cases were from the restive northwest bordering Afghanistan, where the Taliban government in September suddenly stopped a door-to-door vaccination campaign.Authorities in Pakistan say the Afghan Taliban's recent decision to stop door-to-door anti-polio campaign will have repercussions beyond the Afghan border, as people from both sides frequently travel to each other's country. The World Health Organization has confirmed 18 polio cases in Afghanistan this year.Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only two countries in the world where the spread of polio has never been stopped. It is one of the world's most infectious diseases, so it continues to spread anywhere people are not fully vaccinated.

Eight people were killed, and five others sustained injuries on Saturday when a suicide bomber triggered an explosion at a checkpoint near Mir Ali, a town situated in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, close to the Afghan border .The attacker detonated the bomb while riding on the back of a motorbike rickshaw, according to an unnamed local police officer who spoke to AFP.The casualties included four police officers, two members of a state paramilitary force and two civilians. The police officer further stated that among the five wounded, three are in critical condition and have been moved to a nearby military hospital for treatment.An unnamed local government official corroborated to AFP the reported number of fatalities and injuries resulting from the attack.This comes a day after ten police officers were killed in an attack on a check post near the Afghan border. The attack happened in the Dera Ismail Khan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. About 20 to 25 militants targeted the Frontier Constabulary post, a police assistance force. The Pakistan Taliban , also known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), claimed the attack in a statement to AFP.Since the Taliban's resurgence in Afghanistan in 2021, Pakistan has faced a surge in terrorism, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, which border Afghanistan.
