Hafiz plotting India attacks using Bangladesh as launchpad: Intel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hafiz-plotting-india-attacks-using-bangladesh-as-launchpad-intel/articleshow/125212841.cms,"Hafiz Saeed

NEW DELHI: Alarming new intelligence suggests that Pakistan-based terrorists, led by designated global terrorist Hafiz Saeed, are actively plotting to open new fronts for attacks on India, with Bangladesh being cultivated as a new launchpad.The revelation comes directly from a video recording of a rally held in Khairpur Tamewali, Pakistan, on Oct 30, where senior LeT commander Saifullah Saif made a dangerous disclosure. Saifullah explicitly said that “Hafiz Saeed was not sitting idle; he was preparing to attack India through Bangladesh”.He claimed that Laskar-e-Taiba operatives were already active in “East Pakistan (ie Bangladesh)” and were prepared to “answer India (for Operation Sindoor)”.Further information indicates that Saeed has dispatched a close associate to Bangladesh to radicalise local youth under the pretext of ‘jihad’ and provide them with terrorist training.The video also shows Saif openly instigating people to wage war against India. Disturbingly, the event was attended by children, clearly demonstrating that terrorist organisations are attempting to exploit and indoctrinate minors for the purpose of ‘jihad’ against India.The inflammatory rhetoric and visible presence of children highlight the profound threat of radicalisation being orchestrated from Pakistani soil.Adding a geopolitical dimension to his dangerous claims, Saif also falsely praised the Pakistani military, mentioning an alleged response after what he termed “India’s Operation Sindoor” on the night of May 9-10.He further claimed a shift in international alignments, saying, “Now, America is with us, and Bangladesh is also getting closer to Pakistan again.” These claims of shifting alliances appeared intended to boost morale among the attendees while confirming the concerted efforts by LeT to activate and utilise a new operational theatre right on India’s eastern border.Security agencies are now on alert regarding this new, complex threat emanating from the Bangladesh-Pakistan nexus, sources said. Surveillance has been intensified on infiltration from Bangladesh.","Alarming new intelligence suggests that Pakistan-based terrorists are actively plotting to open new fronts for attacks on India.

From Terror To Progress: Defence Minister Rajnath Singh Signals End Of Left-Wing Extremism In India

DHAKA: Bangladesh on Sunday sharply reacted to defence minister Rajnath Singh ’s remarks accusing chief adviser Muhammad Yunus of making provocative statements, saying they were “incorrect” and “not respectful of propriety and diplomatic nicety”.During an interview, Singh was asked about Yunus’s recent “provocative statements” and gifting a book to a senior Pakistani military official that showed “some areas of northeast India as part of Bangladesh”. “It is very unfortunate. He should be careful. As far as neighbours are concerned, we want to maintain ties. We do not seek tense relations with our neighbours,” Singh had said.Bangladesh foreign ministry spokesperson S M Mahbubul Alam told reporters, “We consider Singh’s comments incorrect and unhelpful and not respectful of propriety and diplomatic nicety.” He added, “Bangladesh also believes that differences in perspectives are best addressed through constructive and respectful engagement.”Hardliners here have been claiming that chunks of India’s northeastern states and West Bengal are parts of Bangladesh and have justified the illegal migration of Bangladeshis there. Yunus, who gifted the coffee table book to Pakistan joint chiefs of staff committee chairman General Sahir Shamshad Mirza, had earlier this year pitched for the “extension of the Chinese economy to encompass India’s northeast”.","Rajnath Singh accused chief adviser Muhammad Yunus of making provocative statements.

JNUSU polls: Aditi Mishra becomes JNU’s 1st woman president since 2019; ABVP draws blank as Left sweeps all posts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/left-sweeps-jnusu-polls-first-woman-prez-since-2019/articleshow/125141227.cms,"Left sweeps JNUSU polls, first woman prez since 2019

JNU Clash: Student Union President Among 28 Detained, 6 Cops Injured During Protest Against ABVP





NEW DELHI: In a decisive victory, the Left Unity panel swept all four central posts in the Jawaharlal Nehru University Students' Union (JNUSU) elections for 2025-26 on Thursday, with Aditi Mishra of AISA becoming the university's first woman president since Aishe Ghosh in 2019. The results mark a strong comeback for the Left, which had lost one post to ABVP in the delayed 2024-25 polls this April.Mishra, a PhD student from Centre for Comparative Politics and Political Theory, secured 1,937 votes, defeating ABVP's Vikas Patel, who polled 1,488 votes. The margin of 449 votes is up from 272 recorded in the April poll.The presidential candidate of Progressive Students' Association (PSA), Shinde Vijayalaxmi Vyankat Rao, who gained traction among voters with her fiery presidential speech targeting both left and right politics on the campus, took away 1,276 votes while NSUI trailed with 419 votes.In the vice-presidential race, Left's K Gopika Babu from SFI registered the highest tally across all posts, winning by a massive margin of 1,314, up from 34 in the April poll. She secured 3,101 votes while ABVP's Tanya Kumari got 1,787 and NSUI's Shaikh Shahnawaz Alam 370.For the post of general secretary, Left's Sunil Yadav from DSF won by 104 votes, a little dip from April's 114, polling 2,005 votes against ABVP's Rajeshwar Kant Dubey's 1,901.The joint secretary's post was also clinched by Left, with Danish Ali securing 2,083 votes and defeating ABVP's Anuj Damra (1,797) by a margin of 286 votes. In the previous poll, ABVP had bagged this post with a margin of 45.This year's election saw 20 candidates in the fray for the four central panel posts, including six woman candidates, reflecting an increase in women's participation in the campus politics.During the early rounds of counting, when about 4,300 votes were tallied, ABVP was leading on two seats — general secretary and joint secretary. However, once votes from School of Social Sciences and School of Languages were opened, Left secured the lead on all posts. Both these centres have historically voted overwhelmingly for Left candidates.The day-long counting unfolded amid high-decibel sloganeering, drum beats and bursts of celebration as each round was declared. Late at night, tensions briefly flared when a group of students carrying Palestine flags clashed with ABVP supporters. Students alleged that ABVP members tore a flag while ABVP denied the charge, claiming the group had raised anti-govt slogans.Observers say the results reaffirm the united Left's dominance on the campus. The outcome also signals that while new entrants like PSA have injected energy into the campus discourse, the traditional Left remains the primary force shaping student politics at JNU, they add.",The Left Unity panel swept all four central posts in the Jawaharlal Nehru University Students' Union (JNUSU) elections for 2025-26 on Thursday.

Pakistan Using Drones To Smuggle Arms Into India, Punjab Police Busts Network, Recover Huge Cache

AHMEDABAD: A 35-year-old Hyderabad doctor arrested in Gujarat with drone-smuggled weapons from Pakistan and materials to produce the deadly toxin ricin was identified Sunday as the central figure in an IS-sponsored terrorist plot to strike multiple Indian cities.Two other suspects in the conspiracy, a tailor from Uttar Pradesh's Shamli and a student from Lakhimpur Kheri, were traced to Banaskantha.Gujarat Police's Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) caught Ahmed Mohiyuddin Saiyed on Nov 8 with two Glock pistols, a Beretta, 30 live cartridges and 4 kg of castor-bean mash, from which ricin is extracted.He was on the move when investigators intercepted his silver hatchback at Adalaj toll plaza on Ahmedabad-Mehsana Road.Saiyed's call records led to the arrest of UP natives Azad Suleman Sheikh, 20, and Mohammad Suhail Mohammad Saleem Khan, 23. Both had been allegedly supplying firearms and cartridges to the doctor, who has an MBBS from China, officials said.Ricin is a highly toxic poison derived from castor beans after the oil has been extracted. The substance has no known antidote if ingested, inhaled or injected. Castor oil, which is used for skincare and in various commercial products, does not contain the toxin.ATS officers said Saiyed had been in contact with Abu Khadija, an Afghanistan-based operative linked to Islamic State-Khorasan Province. The doctor had been allegedly producing ricin in large quantities, possibly for mass poisoning, he said.The suspect conducted reconnaissance of unspecified security-sensitive sites in Lucknow, Delhi and Ahmedabad. The weapons came from Hanumangarh in Rajasthan. Saiyed and the other arrested men told interrogators that their handler used drones from Pakistan to deliver arms across the border.Deputy SP SL Chaudhary led the operation to bust the module based on initial intelligence about Saiyed's movements in Ahmedabad.An FIR was registered at the ATS police station against all three arrested men and Abu Khadija, who is on the run, under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and Arms Act. A local court gave ATS custody of Saiyed until Nov 17. The other two suspects will be produced in court separately. ATS officials said investigations were continuing to identify and arrest other operatives involved in the conspiracy.","Gujarat Police's Anti-Terrorism Squad caught Ahmed Mohiyuddin Saiyed on Nov 8 with two Glock pistols, a Beretta, 30 live cartridges and 4 kg of castor-bean mash.

INS Sahyadri docks at Guam as Quad's Malabar naval exercise kicks off today,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ins-sahyadri-docks-at-guam-as-quads-malabar-naval-exercise-kicks-off-today/articleshow/125209323.cms,"INS Sahyadri

NEW DELHI: The Quad leaders’ summit to be hosted by India may no longer be taking place this year but navies of the four countries are all set to kick off their top-notch Malabar exercise off Guam in the western Pacific Ocean from Monday.Indian guided-missile stealth frigate INS Sahyadri has now joined the American Aegis guided-missile destroyer USS Fitzgerald, Australian Anzac-class frigate HMAS Ballarat and Japanese helicopter destroyer JS Hyuga at Guam, a strategic US military base, for the intense combat manoeuvres from Nov 10 to 18.The `Cope India’ air combat exercise between India and the US that was slated in Gwalior from Monday, with Japan and Australia as observers, however, has been deferred as of now. The US was supposed to deploy F-35 fifth-generation stealth fighters and B-1 Lancer supersonic heavy bombers for the exercise. Instead, it has sent a solitary B-1 aircraft for “bomber integration sorties” with the IAF.On the maritime front, it will be the 29th edition of the Malabar exercise, which began as a bilateral endeavour between India and the US in 1992 but includes all the Quad countries now.“INS Sahyadri’s participation in the Malabar exercise reaffirms India's enduring partnership and its commitment to strengthening coordination, enhancing interoperability, and demonstrating a collective resolve to safeguard regional security,” the Indian Navy said on Sunday.The exercise, however, comes amid the Trump administration indicating that his country’s long-standing Indo-Pacific strategy to counter an aggressive and expansionist China is no longer a top priority.India, Australia and Japan, however, remain extremely concerned about China’s continuing `Grey Zone’ tactics to push its vexatious territorial claims in the Indo-Pacific, be it against its neighbours in the South and East China Seas or the 3,488-km Line of Actual Control with India.Though India and the US inked an expansive new 10-year defence framework on Oct 31, overall bilateral ties have been in atailspin since President Donald Trump imposed 50% tariffs on New Delhi,including 25% over its purchase of Russian oil, earlier this year.India, however, decided to go ahead with the Malabar exercise in the belief that the bilateral strategic partnership with the US built over the last two decades, with defence cooperation being its cornerstone, was in no danger of unravelling, as was first reported by TOI.Parallelly, India is cranking up its defence ties with the other Quad countries, Australia and Japan, as well as other regional players like South Korea and the Philippines, all of whom are deeply concerned about China’s muscle-flexing in the Indo-Pacific.The `harbour phase’ of the Malabar on Nov 10-12 will feature operational planning and discussions, alignment on communication protocols, familiarisation visits between participating nations, and sports fixtures, the Navy said.The `sea phase’ from Nov 13 to 17, in turn, will see the warships and aircraft taking part in drills focusing on joint fleet operations, anti-submarine warfare, gunnery serials and flying operations, it added.","The Quad leaders’ summit to be hosted by India may no longer be taking place this year.

Trophy-hunting syndicate of the rich & influential exposed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trophy-hunting-syndicate-of-the-rich-influential-exposed/articleshow/125208066.cms,"Probe also revealed that two members of the alleged syndicate had travelled to southern African countries to practise hunting (AI-generated image)

BHOPAL: What began as a wildlife meat seizure of blackbuck and sambar in Madhya Pradesh has exploded into one of India's most chilling wildlife crime investigations - a sprawling probe that has unearthed an alleged trophy-hunting syndicate operating across nine districts, linked to affluent clients, rifle-club insiders and even cross-border hunting circles.Nearly a year after three Mumbai-based youths were arrested, forensic specialists have cracked encrypted mobile data from seized phones, uncovering a cache of videos, GPS logs and chat records that laid bare a covert commercial game-hunting racket posing as ""sports gatherings"". A total of 60 kills of blackbuck, chinkara and sambar have been established between 2022 and 2024. The operation, investigators say, turned protected forests into private killing grounds for the wealthy.Moreover, the case has now drawn the attention of the Bishnoi community of Rajasthan, which holds blackbucks sacred. The community has filed an intervening application (IA) before MP high court's Indore bench, opposing the bail plea of one of the suspects, Salman Piyarji of Mumbai. The IA will come up for a special hearing on Tuesday.This massive antelope poaching was reportedly modelled on southern Africa-style game hunts, where wealthy participants pay to track and shoot animals for trophies or meat.Investigators said those involved had studied and replicated safari-hunting formats - complete with preselected ""targets"", night chases, and trophy photo sessions in the forests of central India.Among the decrypted files is a video purportedly showing a blackbuck being shot, then its throat being slit with a knife to drain its blood as it gasps for air. Recorded under torchlight, the footage is one of several videos showing alleged night hunts carried out by the syndicate. There are many more.Sharad Jatav, spokesperson for State Tiger Strike Force (STSF), told TOI that the forensic data has ""opened a Pandora's box"". ""They mainly targeted males, be it blackbuck, chinkara, chital or sambar. We have matched the videos with the mobile-location data of the suspects,"" Jatav said.He said males were targeted because their horns were taken as trophies. ""Whether these outsiders were being charged by the Bhopal-based group facilitating these hunts or if it was purely for sport is still under investigation. Key local suspects are yet to be arrested. Their questioning will reveal more. The rifles have been sent for a ballistic examination,"" he said.Jatav said the group first met during a religious gathering in Bhopal, and ""it is possible that more game hunters from other states travelled to Madhya Pradesh for similar expeditions"".Investigations also revealed that two members of the alleged syndicate had travelled to southern African countries to practise hunting legally for trophies and meat from antelopes.The decrypted data indicates that between 2022 and December 2024, the network orchestrated hunts that killed more than 60 protected animals across Narmadapuram, Rajgarh, Sehore, Shajapur, Raisen, Vidisha, and parts of Bhopal, Ujjain, and Indore divisions. These alleged hunts were marketed to clients as exclusive ""wildlife sport experiences"".The case first came to light in Dec 2024, when STSF, Indore forest department, and local police arrested three alleged poachers - Johar Sain, Iyaz, and Salman Piyarji - at Kishanganj forest range in Indore district. Officers seized 65kg of suspected wildlife meat, a country-made pistol, three live cartridges, and an SUV with a Maharashtra registration allegedly used for transporting carcasses. After months of forensic analysis, the fourth arrest was made on Oct 24 this year when Sabah (45), son of Salasin, was picked up from Mitra Nagar, Jogeri, Mumbai.Investigators are examining possible links between the alleged hunters and certain rifle club members suspected of supplying weapons, ammunition, and logistical support. Some are believed to have helped identify forest-edge hunting zones for the group. ""The evidence confirms a commercial operation masquerading as sport. More arrests are expected in Maharashtra and Rajasthan,"" a senior investigator said.","A total of 60 kills of blackbuck, chinkara and sambar have been established.

HYDERABAD: Girls from migrant Hindu families of Bengal are being drugged and exploited in pockets of Hyderabad's Old City on AIMIM's watch, Union junior home minister Bandi Sanjay alleged Sunday, days after slamming Asaduddin Owaisi 's party and Congress for what he claimed were attempts to ""turn Telangana into an Islamic state"".""Hindus in West Bengal have no safety cover... Now, they are facing a similar situation in the Old City of Hyderabad too,"" he said, termling these stories of alleged exploitation ""The Hyderabad Files"". Sanjay said that he had already reached out to the families of women and girls allegedly targeted by men from ""another community"".""Initially, they lured a girl from school to a Muslim classmate's house under the guise of a birthday party, where she was offered chocolates laced with drugs... She was later kidnapped and assaulted for six days,"" he said at a presser. ""When the girl's parents approached police, they were dismissed, and the case was closed without any investigation. The girl was later blackmailed with videos of the assault. She was even forced to bring her other friends. ""Sanjay said the survivor named nine other girls who suffered similar abuse. ""Hundreds of such incidents are going on right in the middle of the city without being reported.The local police are scared as they operate under pressure from AIMIM.""In one instance, the minister alleged, a minor was abducted by a gang of drug addicts. When she returned home and the family filed a police complaint, the case was ""abruptly shut"" without a proper investigation.""The girl is now battling addiction and exhibiting erratic behaviour. Despite having evidence, including CCTV footage, no action has been taken against the gang,"" he said, displaying CCTV snapshots of two men allegedly trying to abduct a girl.Sanjay said that he knew the parents of one such alleged victim attempting suicide. He urged CM Revanth Reddy to take immediate action in all cases, failing which he warned that ""Hindu protection squads"" would be set up in the Old City.The minister also asked the CM to deploy ""capable police officers"", free of political interference, to dismantle the alleged drug network. ""What is the intelligence wing doing? The CM is also the state home minister...Is he only looking out for his family members and leaving the rest to feel unsafe?"" he said.Officers at Charminar police station dismissed the minister's allegations as false. ""An investigation was conducted and the (abducted) girl was traced. But we didn't find any evidence of sexual abuse. The girl had previously gone missing twice,"" an officer said. ""In the most recent case, the girl said she willfully went with the accused. But since she is a minor, a case of abduction has been registered against the person.

Lawyer jumps from house to evade cops, breaks legs

AGRA: A 40-year-old lawyer allegedly raped a gang-rape survivor in an Agra hotel room after luring her with the promise of arranging an out-of-court settlement in a 2022 sexual assault case in which he was reportedly representing one of the accused, reports Sudeep Lavania.The 24-year-old had travelled from Auraiya to attend a hearing Thursday when Jitendra Singh alias Jitendra Dhakre took her to a hotel, served her alcohol during the car ride, and assaulted her. Police arrested him two days later after he jumped from a neighbour's rooftop during a raid and fractured his legs while trying to flee.The rape survivor had come to Agra to appear in court in connection with the gang-rape case against three men in Etmadpur. Advocate Jitendra Singh, who, she said, approached her the same day, claimed he could mediate a settlement with the other accused. He later booked a room for her at a city hotel, saying it was too late for her to return home.The woman told police that Singh initially left her in the hotel room but returned later that night with dinner and, under the pretext of discussing the case, allegedly raped her. She added that though he locked the door from inside and prevented her from leaving, she managed to slip out under the pretext of getting water and hid inside the hotel until he left.She approached police the following morning and filed a complaint, based on which an FIR was registered under BNS section 64(1) (rape).Investigators visited the hotel, collected CCTV footage and visitor records, and launched a manhunt to trace Singh. A forensic team examined the room, and officials said both digital and physical evidence were being preserved. Police also recovered entries from the hotel's visitor register and CCTV footage showing Singh and the woman entering the premises together.Agra DCP (city) Sayeed Ali Abbar said, ""During a raid at the accused's house, he jumped from a neighbour's roof and fractured both legs.

Doctors treating the two women said their PTSD grew from a single tormenting despair: no chance of conceiving again. Both women had undergone tubal ligation years earlier, choices made when their families felt complete.Binti Bai, wife of daily-wage labourer Chotulal, had opted for ligation in 2020, two years after the birth of her son Kanha. The collapse killed Kanha, 7, and her daughter Meena, 10. She withdrew into silence, refused food, and stopped sleeping.Rajubai, wife of farmer Harakchand Lodha, had undergone family planning six years earlier.Their 10-year-old son, Kartik died in the collapse, leaving her terrified the family lineage would end. She had three daughters - the youngest, Aarti, survived with a crushed leg and remains under treatment.""After Kartik's death, my wife couldn't sleep or eat,"" said Harakchand. ""Her condition deteriorated, haunted by her inability to conceive again and no boy to carry the bloodline. Now she's regaining health. Her smile is back - instilled with hope. We're praying for a son.""The belief that only sons can carry a family's lineage remains deeply embedded. Daughters are cherished but often seen as leaving the household after marriage, while sons are viewed as heirs who uphold rituals and family names. This patriarchal calculus shapes reproductive decisions - and intensifies grief when a son dies. For both families in Piplodi, the loss was not only emotional but existential, tied to fears of a lineage abruptly ending.Backed by the district administration and the psychiatry team, Rajubai underwent fallopian-tube recanalisation in late Sept at Heera Bai Kanwar women's hospital in Jhalawar. Binti Bai followed on Oct 29. Her husband Chotulal said: ""Kanha's loss is irreparable. But the operation has given fresh hope.""Jhalawar chief medical health officer Dr Sajid Khan said the sterilisation reversal procedure is undertaken only in the ""rarest of rare"" cases. ""We did it to instil hope for life in two families. Both were devastated, in deep shock and depression. Our psychologists convinced them they could regain motherhood.""District collector Ajay Singh Rathore has assured IVF access in Kota or Jaipur if needed and ordered a medical board to evaluate further treatment pathways.Hope is the only tool for revival, according psychiatrist Dr Rashid Gauri, who led counselling. ""The absence of hope for a child after tubal ligation was the core of their shattered mental status. Three months of sessions prepared them mentally and physically for the surgery.""INDIA","The July 25 collapse of the govt upper primary school in Rajasthan's Jhalawar district claimed the son and daughter of Binti Bai and the only son of Rajubai Lodha.

Ben Shapiro accuses Candace Owens of serious claims about Erika Kirk





New leaked text messages between Charlie Kirk and Candace Owens have shocked many online. The screenshots, posted by AF Post on X, show that before his death, Kirk believed Ben Shapiro was trying to “kill” both his and Owens’ careers as they got more famous. In the messages, Candace Owens sent Charlie Kirk an article titled “LEAK: Ben Shapiro’s YAF Launches Smear Campaign Against Charlie Kirk and Candace Owens – DANGEROUS.”Charlie Kirk replied with a laugh, then said Owens had become “bigger than Ben,” and that Shapiro wanted her to “punch down to him.” In another text, Kirk told Owens, “He views you as my slave. 100%. ‘Control her’ is what he was really saying when he called.” The texts do not show any date or time, so it’s unclear when the conversation took place. The messages were shared by AF Post, but their authenticity hasn’t been confirmed by any official source.While these leaked texts spread online, Ben Shapiro spoke about Candace Owens on The Megyn Kelly Show. During his talk, Shapiro said Owens had done “vile” things and that Kelly should have called her out. He then said, “If this were on the Left, and somebody was accusing Charlie Kirk’s wife of having murdered him, I assume you’d be talking about it.”When Kelly asked if Candace Owens had really accused Erika Kirk, Charlie Kirk’s widow, of killing her husband, Shapiro replied, “She’s accusing TPUSA insiders and other members of the right wing, including Seth Dillon, of being involved in the murder of Charlie Kirk.”Owens quickly reacted on X, posting Ben Shapiro’s clip and calling him a liar. She wrote that he was “lying through his teeth” and called him “completely deranged.” Candace Owens said Shapiro was trying to pressure Kelly into speaking badly about her using false claims.After Ben Shapiro’s comments, Erika Kirk appeared on Fox News with Jesse Watters and spoke about the rumors. She said people should “pray and think” before posting things online about her late husband because it could hurt their kids in the future.Also Read: YouTuber Candace Owens Fires Back At Ben Shapiro After He Claims She Accused Erika Kirk Of Killing Charlie Kirk Charlie Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA, was shot dead on September 10, 2025.

BBC director-general Tim Davie quits after 20 years amid row over misleading edit of Trump’s January 6 speech,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/bbc-director-general-tim-davie-quits-after-20-years-amid-row-over-misleading-edit-of-trumps-january-6-speech/articleshow/125206052.cms,"What was the row about?



Davie takes 'ultimate responsibility'







Tim Davie resigned as British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) director-general on Sunday as pressure mounted over a Panorama programme accused of cutting together Donald Trump’s words in a way that misled viewers, triggering one of the broadcaster’s biggest rows in years.Deborah Turness, the BBC’s CEO of News, has also resigned as anger grew inside the newsroom.The uproar began after an internal BBC dossier revealed concerns about how a Panorama documentary titled Trump: A Second Chance? edited clips from US President Donald Trump’s January 6, 2021, speech. The edits made it appear that he told supporters he would march with them to the US Capitol to ""fight like hell"". The documentary aired shortly before last year's US election. White House later accused the BBC of ""100 per cent fake news"".The document was written by former journalist Michael Prescott and circulated inside the BBC. It pointed to serious editorial failures and raised additional questions about BBC Arabic’s coverage of the Gaza conflict. The Telegraph’s reporting on the memo triggered an immediate backlash, prompting the House of Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee to demand answers from BBC chairman Samir Shah.Announcing his resignation, Davie said: ""There have been some mistakes made and as Director-General I have to take ultimate responsibility.""He added that his decision followed high pressure from the job. ""I wanted to let you know that I have decided to leave the BBC after 20 years. This is entirely my decision, and I remain very thankful to the Chair and Board for their unswerving and unanimous support throughout my entire tenure, including during recent days.""He said he would work with the Board on the timing of his departure to ensure an orderly transition, according to the Daily Mail. He said: ""In these increasingly polarised times, the BBC is of unique value and speaks to the very best of us."" He acknowledged that recent debate around BBC News had contributed to his decision.BBC Chairman Samir Shah paid tribute to Davie. ""This is a sad day for the BBC. Tim has been an outstanding Director-General for the last five years. He has propelled the BBC forward with determination, single-mindedness and foresight."" He added that he understood the pressure Davie had faced and respected his decision.","Tim Davie resigns as British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) director-general.

Turning towards Taiwan



'The ground was shaking'







MANILA: A weakening Typhoon Fung-wong departed the Philippines over the South China Sea on Monday morning, after its driving winds and heavy rain killed at least two people and forced more than a million to evacuate.Fung-wong, with a footprint that spanned nearly the entirety of the archipelago, slammed into the country's eastern seaboard Sunday evening as a ""super typhoon"" after uprooting trees and swamping towns further south.It landed just days after Typhoon Kalmaegi swept through the islands of the central Philippines, claiming at least 224 lives.Schools and government offices across swathes of main island Luzon, including Manila, were closed Monday, though predicted heavy rains had yet to materalise.In Aurora province, where Fung-wong made landfall the night before, rescue worker Geofry Parrocha said officials were only now able to assess the damage.""We're seeing many damaged houses and some of our main roads were not passable due to landslides,"" he told AFP Monday morning from Dipaculao town, where power had yet to be restored.""We couldn't mobilise last night because the rain was heavy and the volume of water was high.""Aurora Taay, mayor of the province's Dingalan town, told a Facebook Live audience that numerous houses and boats along the shoreline had been smashed amid massive waves.The state weather service said Monday that the typhoon, which saw 1.4 million people evacuated, was now expected to turn towards Taiwan as it continued to weaken.On Sunday, Samar province, one of those hammered by Typhoon Kalmaegi last week, recorded the first known death from Fung-wong.Rescuer Juniel Tagarino in Catbalogan City told AFP the body of a 64-year-old woman attempting to evacuate had been pulled out from under debris and fallen trees.""The wind was so strong and the rain was heavy... According to her family members, she might have forgotten something and went back inside her house,"" Tagarino said.The civil defence office later confirmed a second death, a person who drowned in a flash flood on Catanduanes island.Further north, in Cagayan province, people sheltering in an evacuation centre told AFP that fear of flooding had convinced them to leave their homes.""We often suffer flooding in our home, so when we were told to evacuate, we evacuated, because we would be trapped,"" said Loretta Salquina.Scientists warn that storms are becoming more powerful due to human-driven climate change. Warmer oceans allow typhoons to strengthen rapidly, and a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, meaning heavier rainfall.Catanduanes was lashed by heavy wind and rain early Sunday, with storm surges sending waves hurtling over streets and floodwaters inundating homes in some areas.""The waves started roaring around 7:00 am. When the waves hit the seawall, it felt like the ground was shaking,"" Edson Casarino, 33, a resident of Catanduanes' Virac town, told AFP.Video verified by AFP showed a church in the town surrounded by floodwaters that reached halfway up its entrance.Major flooding was also reported in southern Luzon's Bicol region.In Guinobatan, a town of about 80,000 in Bicol's Albay province, verified video showed streets transformed into raging torrents of water.Only days earlier, Typhoon Kalmaegi sent floodwaters rushing through the towns and cities of Cebu and Negros islands, sweeping away cars, riverside shanties and massive shipping containers.Search and rescue efforts in Cebu were suspended on Saturday due to safety concerns over the approaching super typhoon.","Typhoon Fung-wong leaves the Philippines over the South China Sea on Monday morning.

“We failed to do both things in this case - to keep Emiru safe and to prevent the assault from happening. We deeply regret the distress we caused for Emiru, our other creators, and the entire community.”

“PR stunt”

Fans call Twitch’s apology to Emiru “insincere” and demand real safety reforms

“Twitch doesn’t need another statement. It needs to make conventions safe for the people who built the platform.”





Twitch is facing intense criticism from fans and creators after issuing an apology to streamer Emiru for the assault she suffered during TwitchCon 2025 in San Diego. The incident, which occurred during a meet-and-greet session, involved an attendee physically assaulting Emiru in what many have described as a major security failure on Twitch’s part. Although the platform has publicly admitted its shortcomings and pledged to support nonprofits addressing sexual violence, the community remains deeply dissatisfied with its response.In a post shared on Twitch’s official social channels, the company said,The apology, however, quickly sparked outrage, with many labeling it arather than a sincere acknowledgment of wrongdoing. Users on X (formerly Twitter) accused Twitch of downplaying the severity of the incident and failing to take accountability for allegedly letting the assailant go and withholding key evidence from authorities.Online reactions have been swift and furious. Many fans and fellow streamers criticized the platform’s leadership, accusing Twitch of being dismissive and reactive instead of proactive. Across social media, users demanded structural change rather than another public apology, arguing that creators’ safety should be prioritized over corporate image. One viral comment read,Critics also highlighted Twitch’s history of mishandled safety cases at conventions, questioning whether meaningful reforms will ever take place. Fans and creators are now calling for stricter vetting processes for event attendees, increased on-site security, and immediate enforcement protocols when harassment or violence occurs. Many believe these steps are essential for rebuilding trust between Twitch and its creator community, especially after such a high-profile failure.While Twitch’s donation to nonprofits working to prevent sexual violence was seen as a step in the right direction, many feel it’s not enough to repair the damage caused. The platform now faces mounting pressure to back its apology with visible action, by implementing stronger safety measures and restoring confidence among creators. Until that happens, the backlash over its handling of the Emiru incident shows no sign of fading.Also Read: Heartwarming moment as Cinna’s dad supports her and Valkyrae for another ‘Sisathon’ stream","Twitch is facing intense criticism from fans and creators after issuing an apology to streamer Emiru for the assault she suffered during TwitchCon 2025 in San Diego.

Mamdani’s rise throws up immigrants fear vs affordability crisis debate in MAGA world,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/mamdanis-rise-throws-up-immigrants-fear-vs-affordability-crisis-debate-in-maga-world/articleshow/125167021.cms,"Zohran Mamdani (AP image)

‘CITY THAT DEVOURS MAYORS’: Zohran Mamdani Faces BRUTAL Reality Of Running NYC | EXPLAINED





WASHINGTON: From the MAGA perspective, millionaires are fleeing Manhattan, cops are quitting NYPD en masse, and the Big Apple is rotting faster than strawberries on a summer day because New York City has fallen…to Communists, Islamists and immigrants. Memes show the Statue of Liberty under a burka or niqab, hammer and sickle projected on the Empire State Building, and public transport overcrowded with immigrants in native grab among other bleak outcomes of Zohran Mamdani victory in the mayoral election. “Imagine North Korea… with a dash of Sharia,” goes one rightwing parody of Frank Sinatra’s song New York, New York.Liberals and progressives meanwhile are cockahoop with delight at the resurgence of the left, reflected in a raft of jokes, some of them self-deprecating, on late-night shows. ""Today Democrats are walking around with a spring in their step like a divorced mom in her 40s whose new haircut just got her carded at two different bars,” riffed Seth Meyers, whose late-night gig on NBC beams from the Rockefeller Center in NYC. Trump’s bete-nore Jimmy Kimmel, whose late-night show on ABC broadcasts from across the country in Hollywood, Los Angeles, joked that President’s social media post after the rout (“...ANDSO IT BEGINS!) “was either a response to Mamdani winning the mayoral race, or he just sat down on the toilet.”Toilet humor aside, the more serious commentariat agreed on one thing: Mamdani’s rise from an obscure local legislator who polled less than 1 percent when he began his campaign to a monumental victory with over 50 percent vote has electrified American politics. Although he is not eligible to run for the White House (he is not born in the U.S., a Constitutional requirement to run for President), many are already seeing him, or at least his policy prescriptions, as a challenge, and perhaps even an opportunity, for MAGA supreme Donald Trump to define him in fearful terms.“His smile is disarming, but his ideas are armed to the teeth,” the Wall Street Journal said of Mamdani’s policies, suggesting that his victory could inspire more leftist candidates to challenge moderate Democrats, allowing President Trump to drive home his message of radical left lunatics taking over America. Trump himself is said to have acknowledged that Mamdani is a “talented politician” and “slick talker,” according to one report.So despite railing against the “communist lunatic,” Trump is now showing signs of learning something from the electoral setback. Pilloried for his tone-deaf bragging about his new White House ballroom and his hosting a Gatsby-themed party at his Mar-o-Lago estate at a time of government shutdown, the President briefly embraced the term “affordability” – which Mamdani flogged during his campaign – while discussing a deal to reduce the price of certain drugs like anti-obesity medications at a White House event on Thursday. Taunted from the left that “Affordability is Trump's word of the week,” the President shrank from the word later, saying “I don’t want to hear about affordability” and insisting that inflation is under control and prices are coming down under him. “My cost are lower than the Democrats on everything, especially oil and gas! So the Democrats “affordability” issue is DEAD! STOP LYING!!!” he posted on Truth Social.But even hard-core MAGA lawmakers previously seen as rabid race-baiters are starting to put affordability issues ahead of immigrant demonisation that has been their go-to issue. “Grocery prices remain high. Energy prices are high. My electricity bills are higher…So, affordability is a problem,” Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has sounded increasingly critical of Trump, in recent weeks, said in a TV interview on Thursday, adding that she is worried about her children’s generation because “they’re having a very hard time. ”Even millionaires and billionaires, said to be decamping NYC in the face of the ""socialist surge"" seemed to acknowledge Mamdani has raised important issues. ""Congrats on the win. Now you have a big responsibility. If I can help NYC, just let me know what I can do,"" Bill Ackman, billionaire hedge fund manager and NewYorker who contributed $ 1 million to Mamdani's opponent Andrew Cuomo, posted soon after Mamdani's win.",Zohran Mamdani won the NYC mayoral election with over 50 percent of the vote.

JAIPUR: Nine days after a nine-year-old girl died after falling from a fourth-floor parapet at Neerja Modi School in Jaipur, an audio recording of her emotional plea to her mother has raised disturbing questions about the school's alleged inaction against bullying.In the one year-old recording, the child can be heard sobbing and begging her mother to not send her back to school, pleading to be enrolled elsewhere. ""I don't want to go to school. Please don't send me,"" she said through tears, a chilling echo of the ordeal her family now says was ignored for over a year.The girl died on Nov 1 after falling off a fourth-floor parapet inside the school. Since then, the police and education department have launched separate investigations, but the family alleges both are progressing at a painfully slow pace.Her uncle, Sahil Dev, told TOI Sunday that the audio was recorded in July last year. ""She was facing constant bullying for over a year. We informed her class teacher about it, but she didn't pay attention,"" he said, adding that the family even tried to move her to another school, but that didn't materialise.Dev said the family was shocked by the attitude of the investigating officials. ""One member of the education department's probe team even remarked, ‘Why did the girl celebrate Halloween?' — a completely irrelevant and insensitive comment,"" he said.He added that one of the teachers admitted to investigators that the child was bullied inside the school. ""Even after this, no action has been taken. Nine days have passed,"" Dev said. He also said the family repeatedly told school authorities that some students of her class were tormenting her, but the school chose to turn a blind eye.The family claimed they approached two class teachers in the past to raise concerns about the bullying from other students, but their pleas went unheard.","A nine-year-old girl died after falling from a fourth-floor parapet at Neerja Modi School in Jaipur.

BENGALURU: Former grocery store chain owner Ravi Prasad Reddy of Hebbagodi, arrested on charges of murdering two friends, had become a vegetable vendor after incurring a loss of around Rs 5 crore during the Covid-19 pandemic.Around 60 people to whom he lent money or with whom he had invested in chit funds, died or left the city during the pandemic, causing him a huge loss, police investigations have revealed.Reddy, 40, allegedly murdered tea shop owner R Madesh (41), who was also involved in the chit-fund business, and Balappa Reddy (61), who owned a metal fabrication factory — to rob them and demand ransom. Reddy was arrested from a bar close to his home Saturday afternoon.The accused was shot at and injured in both knees when he tried to attack police personnel near a burial ground at Bommasandra, where he was taken for a spot investigation late Saturday night.Police picked up Reddy's two associates — Dhanush and Sateesh — for questioning as they accompanied him during Balappa's abduction on Nov 6. Reddy's elder sister, Sunanda, is also on the radar as she was allegedly in the same vehicle during the abduction.Police are yet to question her.""We intensified our investigation and questioned the bereaved family members about those with whom the two victims had financial dealings. This is how we zeroed in on the suspect. Special teams of CCB and Hebbagodi police were formed to nab the suspect,"" city police commissioner Seemanth Kumar Singh told TOI.The two murdered men were Reddy's close friends and he claimed to have lent them money earlier.""But they refused to lend me money when I was in deep trouble. This made me develop hatred towards them,"" police quoted Reddy as saying. Cops are also investigating whether Reddy owed them any money.Reddy, from Srisailam in Andhra Pradesh, set up his chain of Happy Family Stores with help from his uncle. He earned good profits, lent money to others, and invested almost Rs 5 crore in chit funds, an investigating officer said.When the Covid-19 pandemic broke out, defaults by his debtors forced him to sell his house and a plot of land near Hebbagodi for Rs 2 crore. He also leased out his stores to his relatives. Despite these efforts, more financial losses compelled his wife and two children to live with his uncle, while Reddy moved to a small house rented from Balappa, one of the victims.To rebuild his life, Reddy set up a vegetable stall and brought Dhanush and Sateesh from Andhra Pradesh to help him with the business.Inspiration drawn from crime filmsAccording to Reddy, movies showing people kidnapping victims for ransom encouraged him to do so. He planned to kidnap the two men and release them after receiving ransom. He purchased an air pistol, a metal detector, and knives. Reddy told cops that he wanted to use the metal detector to find hidden treasures.""Investigations revealed that Reddy hatched his conspiracy for around three months. First, he targeted Madesh on Nov 4,"" deputy commissioner of police (Electronics City division) M Narayana told TOI.Reddy was aware that Madesh, who was constructing a house, had Rs 10 lakh in cash stashed there. ""Knowing he would be alone in the under-construction building, I entered the house and threatened Madesh at knifepoint, demanding the money. But he resisted and shouted for help before running away. I chased him and attacked him with a knife. Seeing some neighbours coming out, I sped away on my scooter,"" police quoted Reddy as saying.Reddy waited for two days and decided on his next move as nobody suspected him. This time, he drove an MUV of an advocate-friend to Balappa's factory. Saying he had a business deal to discuss, he made Balappa join him in the vehicle.""He drove the MUV in the direction of Hosur and stopped at a desolate place. Then, he demanded money from Balappa who refused. In a fit of anger, Reddy attacked Balappa with the same knife he used in killing Madesh. Then, he brought the body back to his Hebbagodi residence, shifted it to his goods autorickshaw, and returned the MUV after removing stains. Then, Balappa's body was taken to the forest area near Hosur highway and dumped on the same night,"" an investigating officer said.","Ravi Prasad Reddy, 40, allegedly murdered tea shop owner R Madesh (41), who was also involved in the chit-fund business, and Balappa Reddy (61), who owned a metal fabrication factory.

SURAT: The bodies of Surat-based teacher Jignesh Patel (52) and his teenage daughter Priyanshi (17) — who went missing during a trekking expedition in Nepal — were found buried in snow on Sunday afternoon near the Maleripa Monastery in the Manang district, officials in Nepal said.According to Armed Police Force (APF) deputy spokesperson Shailendra Thapa, the bodies were found about 100 metres above the monastery. The duo last contacted their family on Oct 21, a day after leaving for the Annapurna-3 peak.Patel, a resident of Kadod village in Bardoli taluka, left Surat on Oct 14 for the trek. After reaching Kathmandu and securing necessary permits, he and Priyanshi began their ascent from Gyalsen Hotel at Disyang on Oct 20, telling hotel staff they would visit the monastery and return the same day. However, they never came back.When the pair failed to establish contact by Oct 30, Patel's wife Jagruti raised an alarm and contacted Bardoli MP Prabhu Vasava.Following this, the Surat district authorities coordinated with the Gujarat State Emergency Operations Centre, which alerted the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) and the Indian Embassy in Nepal. Aerial and ground searches were launched using drones and trained rescue personnel.A special mountain rescue team led by DSP Hira Bahadur GC later located the bodies under a thick snow layer. Police suspect they may have ventured further uphill after visiting the monastery and got trapped due to heavy snowfall.Patel, an MA, BEd, was a teacher and tuition instructor for several years.

Now, Sarnaik has pushed the deadline for the shift to Nov 13.The villagers who live along NH48 in Sasupada, Maljipada and Naigaon, among other villages, also said they are ""badly affected"" by traffic snarls and pollution due to the ongoing white topping work on the highway.Sarnaik had assured the residents of Mira Bhayandar that the toll plaza would be shifted and give them relief from traffic issues. However, there was no alternative spot in the MBMC jurisdiction, which led to the plan to shift the toll plaza beyond the Versova bridge (Bhayander Creek bridge) into the jurisdiction of Vasai Virar City Municipal Corporation (VVCMC).On Saturday, Sarnaik visited the Dahisar toll plaza and said it was in the process of being dismantled, which would take another three to four days and thereafter it would be shifted.He also said they would visit NH48 to check for new spots.""Technically and legally speaking the toll of one district cannot be charged in another district,"" said Muzaffar Hussain, former MLC and senior vice-president of Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee. ""They should not be scouting for new places and immediately shift the toll naka to the available premises which is the Octroi Naka,"" he added.Sushant Patil, president of Bhumiputra Foundation, said, ""The transport minister visited NH48 to look for a spot for the MSRDC toll plaza on NHAI road. A lot of pending work needs to be focused on.""","Sarnaik had given a Nov 8 deadline to shift the toll plaza, but is yet to identify a spot for it.

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)





AGRA: A 40-year-old lawyer allegedly raped a 24-year-old gang-rape survivor inside a hotel room in Agra after luring her with the promise of arranging an out-of-court settlement in a 2022 sexual assault case in which he was reportedly representing one of the accused. The woman had travelled from Auraiyya to attend a court hearing on Thursday when Jitendra Singh alias Jitendra Dhakre took her to a hotel, served her alcohol during the car ride, and assaulted her that night. Police arrested him two days later after he jumped from a neighbour's rooftop during a raid at his residence and fractured both legs while trying to flee.She had come to Agra to appear in court in connection with the gang-rape case against three men in Etmadpur. Singh, who she said approached her the same day, claimed he could mediate a settlement with the other accused.Singh later booked a room for her at a city hotel, saying it was too late for her to return home. The woman told police that Singh initially left her in the room but returned later that night with dinner and, under the pretext of discussing the ongoing case, allegedly raped her. She added that though he locked the door from inside and prevented her from leaving, she managed to slip out under the pretext of getting water and hid inside the hotel until he left.She approached the police the following morning and filed a complaint, based on which an FIR was registered under BNS section 64(1) (rape).Investigators collected CCTV footage and visitor records, and launched a manhunt to trace Singh. A forensic team examined the room, and officials said both digital and physical evidence were being preserved. Police also recovered entries from the hotel’s visitor register and CCTV footage showing Singh and the woman entering the premises together.Agra DCP (city) Sayeed Ali Abbar said, “During a raid at the accused’s house, he jumped from a neighbour’s roof and fractured both legs. He was admitted to SN Medical College. On Saturday, we secured his remand and produced him before the court. He has been sent to judicial custody. The woman was sent for a medical examination.” Police confirmed that she had earlier filed a gang-rape complaint in Dec 2022 against three men, all of whom had been arrested. A chargesheet had been submitted in a local Agra court.","Jitendra Singh, 40, allegedly raped a 24-year-old gang-rape survivor inside a hotel room in Agra.

University of Pennsylvania cyber attack: Data worth million exposed





The University of Pennsylvania has confirmed that hackers gained access to several of its internal systems linked to development and alumni activities, stealing confidential data in the process, reports BleepingComputer. The breach, discovered on October 31, occurred after attackers obtained employee credentials through a social engineering scam.""Penn employs a robust information security program; however, access to these systems occurred due to a sophisticated identity impersonation commonly known as social engineering,"" the university said in a statement.The university said its staff quickly locked down the affected systems to stop further intrusions but not before an “offensive and fraudulent email” was sent to members of the Penn community.The university further revealed that it has alerted the FBI and is working with cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike to investigate the incident.According to BleepingComputer’s report, the attackers accessed Penn’s Salesforce donor database, SharePoint files, and other platforms, stealing around 1.71 GB of data. This includes sensitive personal and financial information of alumni and donors such as names, addresses, phone numbers, email IDs, and donation histories.The hackers claimed to have obtained records of roughly 1.2 million donors, including details like “gift histories, wealth ratings, and lifetime commitment amounts.” They also said they sent a mass email to nearly 700,000 people after discovering their access was revoked.The attackers told BleepingComputer that the breach wasn’t politically motivated but aimed at Penn’s “vast, wonderfully wealthy donor database.” However, their communications also included sharp criticism of the university’s diversity, equity, and inclusion policies.The university says it is now strengthening its security systems, conducting staff training on social engineering, and enhancing monitoring tools.Once the probe concludes, Penn plans to notify affected individuals. The university has also urged students, alumni, and donors to stay alert for suspicious emails or phone calls that could be phishing attempts.","University of Pennsylvania has confirmed that hackers gained access to several of its internal systems linked to development and alumni activities.

Ecuador prison clash: Violence over transfer to 'maximum-security' prison; 31 killed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/ecuador-prison-clash-violence-over-transfer-to-maximum-security-prison-31-killed/articleshow/125214310.cms,"



At least 31 inmates were killed in an armed clash at Machala Prison in Ecuador’s El Oro province, authorities confirmed on Sunday. Officials said 27 prisoners died by apparent asphyxiation “among themselves,” describing the deaths as immediate and caused by suspension.According to the initial reports, at least 33 inmates and one police officer were injured during the unrest. Forensic teams and investigators remain at the scene as authorities work to “fully clarify the facts” surrounding the deadly incident.The clash that broke out around 0800 GMT (03:00am local time) marks the latest episode of prison unrest in the South American nation. Locals reported hearing gunfire, explosions and screams coming through the prison walls. Later, a tactical unit from the national police regained control of the facility. Authorities have not yet confirmed the identities of those killed or the exact cause of the violence.The riot, as per the SNAI statement, stemmed from the “reorganisation of inmates” to a new maximum-security prison that will soon begin operating in a different province. The violent confrontation comes less than two months after 14 inmates were killed in a similar outbreak at the same prison, reportedly due to gang rivalries.Ecuador’s prison system has become one of the most violent in Latin America, plagued by overcrowding, corruption, and weakened state control. Gangs with ties to Colombian and Mexican drug cartels have expanded their influence inside facilities. Since 2021, over 500 inmates have been killed in power struggles over illegal trafficking networks. Last year, nationwide riots resulted in the brief hostage-taking of 150 prison officers.","At least 31 inmates were killed in an armed clash at Machala Prison in Ecuador’s El Oro province, authorities confirmed on Sunday.

Illinois governor JB Pritzker has accused Donald Trump's administration of racial profiling after ICE agents stopped interrogated an Indian-origin man about his immigration status and if he was ""aware"" of the Zohran Mamdani's mayoral election in New York City.Pritzker condemned the federal action, calling it an example of authorities questioning US citizens “apparently based on the colour of their skin.”I am appalled they would stop and question a state employee working hard on the job to help improve our state’s roads and infrastructure,” Pritzker said in a statement.“Our state employees should be able to go to work and do their jobs without masked agents targeting them for no legitimate reason,” he added.According to Chicago Sun Times, the employee who is Indian and a US citizen, was stopped by agents while working on the Busse Highway resurfacing project.Meanwhile, the Department of Homeland Security denied that the agents were from the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement or US Customs and Border Protection. The governor’s office did not immediately provide further details.Residents of Park Ridge grew anxious after reports of federal agents in the area prompted local schools to go into lockdown.Students and teachers in Park Ridge–Niles School District 64 were told to remain indoors, Superintendent Ben Collins confirmed, citing reports of immigration agents near several campuses.The incident follows months of intensified federal immigration activity under the Trump administration’s MAGA crackdown, fueling concerns among civil rights groups about racial and nationality-based targeting.Amid the broader enforcement drive, the GOP-led government moved to deploy the National Guard in Chicago as part of “Operation Midway Blitz.” Illinois officials challenged the decision as unconstitutional, and a federal appeals court blocked the deployment last month.","Illinois governor JB Pritzker has accused Donald Trump's administration of racial profiling.

BENGALURU: Yet another video from Bengaluru Central Prison has surfaced on social media, deepening the ongoing controversy over illegal activities inside the high-security facility.The new clip, allegedly recorded inside the Parappana Agrahara jail, shows inmates partying, dancing, and drinking liquor and consuming non-vegetarian food while using plates and mugs as makeshift musical instruments according to news agency PTI.The video which went viral on Sunday shows disposable glasses filled with alcohol arranged alongside plates of cut fruits and fried peanuts. Inmates can be seen cheering, shouting, and dancing to the clanging of utensils, turning the barrack into what appears to be a party zone.The emergence of this new footage comes close on the heels of earlier videos showing high-profile inmates, including serial rapist Umesh Reddy and Islamic State (IS) handler Juhad Hamid Shakil Manna, using mobile phones and watching television inside the same prison.Those videos — some recorded as far back as 2023 — had triggered a massive row, exposing lapses in jail surveillance and control.Reacting to the fresh video, home minister G Parameshwara said the government would take “stringent action against officials, including jail superintendents” for the repeated lapses inside Bengaluru Central Prison.""If the report is not satisfactory, I will constitute a committee to investigate the matter. We will take action against the officials concerned and implement corrective measures to prevent such incidents in the future. I will not tolerate this nonsense — enough is enough,” Parameshwara said.He added that the state government had already approved the installation of CCTVs and mobile jammers in prisons to prevent such violations, but the measures were not fully implemented.“Despite repeated incidents from Parappana Agrahara jail, the problem persists. Though mobile jammers and CCTVs have been approved for installation to prevent such violations, the prisons have failed to implement them,” he said.Officials from the prison department said ADGP (Prisons) B Dayananda has ordered a high-level probe to identify the source of the leaked videos, those responsible for smuggling phones and liquor inside, and any officials complicit in the racket. Additional inspector general of police (prisons) PV Anand Reddy also visited the jail premises to assess the situation.A senior prison officer described the incident as a “major security breach,” warning that the use of mobile phones by terror suspects could allow them to contact handlers of banned outfits or radicalise other inmates.The Bengaluru Central Prison has frequently been in the spotlight for misconduct — from actor Darshan Thoogudeepa allegedly being allowed to use phones and smoke on the lawn, to gold smuggling case accused Ranya Rao’s associate Tarun Raju being filmed with a mobile phone earlier this year.","Video emerges showing inmates partying with liquor and makeshift instruments.

'Zero tolerance — no one is above the law'

'Allegations must be verified, but truth will prevail'

The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has pledged “zero tolerance” in response to the shocking sexual harassment allegations made by national cricketer Jahanara Alam against former team selector and manager Manjurul Alam. BCB president Aminul Islam on Sunday said no one — whether a director, coach, or staff member — will be spared if found guilty after the ongoing investigation.The controversy erupted after Jahanara, speaking in an interview with journalist Riasad Azim, accused Manjurul of sexually harassing her during the 2022 ICC Women's World Cup in New Zealand. She alleged that the former selector made indecent advances and asked lewd, intrusive questions, including about her menstrual cycle. The fast bowler, who has represented Bangladesh in 135 international matches, claimed that other female cricketers had similar experiences but were afraid to speak up due to fear of professional repercussions.Following the explosive interview, several other former players voiced their own experiences, prompting the BCB to launch an official inquiry.BCB chief Aminul Islam reaffirmed that the board will act firmly once the investigation concludes.“You've asked a question, and here's my reply — zero tolerance. Thank you,” Aminul said, adding that the committee should be given time to complete its work.He clarified that no position within the board would offer immunity. “Even the Prime Minister of this country isn't exempt from such rules. We're just ordinary directors. If I go and harass someone, and it's proven to be true, then I'm just an ordinary director — not above the law,” he said.The board has constituted a three-member inquiry panel headed by retired Justice Tariq ul Hakim, with Rubaba Dowla, a newly appointed BCB director, and Barrister Sarwat Siraj Shukla, a senior advocate of the Supreme Court, as members. The committee has been given 15 working days to submit its report.Meanwhile, as per a Cricbuzz report, the BCB has placed four officials linked to women's cricket — manager S.M. Golam Faiyaz, physio Suraiya Akter, coach Mahmud Emon, and coordinator Sarfaraz Babu — on special duty (OSD) pending the inquiry.BCB facilities committee director Shanian Taneem, who sat beside Aminul during the press briefing, supported the president's statement, saying, “Whether it's an employee or a director, the investigation will cover everyone involved. If the committee recommends action, it will be implemented immediately. There will be no special treatment for anyone.”While affirming the board's zero-tolerance stance, Aminul also emphasised the need for a fair process. “If the allegations are true, they will not be tolerated. But since such investigations touch upon personal lives, it can harm those falsely accused. So they should be given five to seven days to defend themselves,” he said.The BCB's official statement echoed the same sentiment: “The BCB is committed to ensuring a safe, respectful, and professional environment for all its players and personnel. The board takes such matters with utmost seriousness and will take appropriate action based on the findings.”Manjurul, however, has denied the allegations, calling them “baseless” and “fabricated.”The case has sparked widespread debate in Bangladesh's cricketing circles, with calls for systemic reform and greater accountability in women's cricket. For now, all eyes are on the inquiry committee, whose findings could reshape the culture and governance of Bangladesh's women's cricket setup.",BCB chief Aminul Islam reaffirmed that the board will act firmly once the investigation concludes.

DHS releases full statement: What it reads







US Border Patrol agents pepper-sprayed Rafael Veraza and his one-year-old daughter Arianna in the Sam’s Club parking lot in Cicero, just outside Chicago’s Little Village neighbourhood, during Operation Midway Blitz on Saturday morning.During the Saturday clash between federal officers and people in Little Village, days after a federal judge tightened rules on how immigration enforcement agents may use force under a preliminary injunction now being appealed by the Department of Justice, ABC news reported.The Department of Homeland Security said its agents had entered the parking lot after facing gunfire and other attacks.The viral video captured the moment Veraza said he and his family were sprayed. “He started spraying from the front of the car towards the back. Basically I got sprayed all over my face,” Veraza said.Veraza, who has had asthma since childhood, said the effects were immediate. “I’m asthmatic. I’ve been with asthma since I was a little kid. So the moment that it hit me, I couldn’t breathe.” He added that his daughter, who was riding in the back of the car, also inhaled the gas and both were briefly hospitalised.“My daughter was trying to open her eyes. She was struggling to breathe.”The US Department of Homeland security is once again justifying their actions. On Sunday, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin posted on social media: “No. There was no crowd control or pepper spray deployed in a Sam’s Club parking lot. Though, over the weekend in Chicago, law enforcement was shot at, bricks thrown at them, they were rammed with vehicles and other attacks...”Homeland Security said Border Patrol agents had entered the parking lot shortly after deploying crowd-control measures on residents of Little Village. It said the actions followed gunshots fired from a black Jeep Wrangler “aimed directly at them”. “Individuals stalked and followed the convoy into the parking lot and a vehicle rammed a Border Patrol’s vehicle,” a DHS statement read in part. “After departing the parking lot, the law enforcement convoy was again attacked resulting in a broken window. ”The department released images showing damage to its vehicles but offered no explanation for why Veraza and his family, who had abandoned their shopping trip after seeing the agents’ presence, were pepper-sprayed. “I’m not even doing a thing,” Veraza said. “I’m trying to exit.”In its statement, Homeland Security continued to label protesters as “rioters”, noting that Border Patrol arrested nine people on Saturday, eight of them U.S. citizens. It remains unclear whether charges have been filed.In response to the crackdown, the Indivisible Chicago Alliance held its second Chicagoland day of action on Sunday. The group gathered in West Town to assemble ICE watch packets containing whistles, buttons and informational pamphlets, and hosted sessions on knowing one’s rights.“Yesterday around 9:30 AM, in the Chicago neighbourhood of Little Village, U.S. Border Patrol was attacked while conducting immigration enforcement operations. Border Patrol was accosted by a hostile crowd that boxed them into a street and alleyway. As they were apprehending a subject, agents came under direct gunfire when a male driving a black Jeep Wrangler fired multiple rounds. He immediately fled the scene.“Attackers then began throwing bricks and even paint cans from a roof, damaging Border Patrol vehicles. Chicago Police Department successfully helped law enforcement evacuate the area as more bricks were thrown at the law enforcements’ vehicle. Fortunately, no Border Patrol agents were injured in this attack.“After clearing the scene of the first attack, Border Patrol then encountered a vehicle that attempted to ram their convoy at the intersection of Cermak and California, but was thwarted when a Controlled Tire Deflation Device was deployed. The Border Patrol convoy then proceeded toward an FBI facility and encountered two drivers trying to impede operations. After they were warned to stop, one of the drivers attempted to ram the convoy. The driver was arrested. Border Patrol reached the FBI facility when rioters attempted to breach security there. Chicago Police responded to help secure the perimeter.“Border Patrol then left the FBI facility and then encountered protesters lying in the street near 26th and Pulaski. As the rioters refused to comply with basic instructions and began throwing objects, Border Patrol deployed crowd control measures, cleared the area, and proceeded to a Sam’s Club parking lot. Individuals stalked and followed the convoy into the parking lot and a vehicle rammed a Border Patrol’s vehicle. Three suspects were immediately arrested for assault.“After departing the parking lot, the law enforcement convoy was again attacked resulting in a broken window. The convoy became stuck at 26th and Kostner and sustained window damage along with a fourth vehicle ramming. The subject fled the scene and Border Patrol pursued. This driver remains at large.“As a result of yesterday’s multiple attacks-fuelled by sanctuary politicians and the media-Border Patrol arrested 8 U.S. citizens and one illegal alien. Thankfully, no Border Patrol agents were injured during these multiple attacks.“‘JB Pritzker and Brandon Johnson have fuelled an environment of lawlessness and assault on federal law enforcement,’ said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. ‘In less than three hours in Chicago, Border Patrol faced gunshots, violent mobs at every stop, bricks and other objects thrown at them, and four vehicle rammings. The violence in Chicago against law enforcement is unprecedented-These attacks are the consequence of vitriolic smears from sanctuary politicians and the media. Just last week, Chicago and national media falsely accused law enforcement of raiding a daycare centre. Now, they are silent when our agents come under gunfire.“‘Make no mistake: Our mission will continue despite the violence. To any Antifa terrorist in Chicago: You will not stop us. You will not slow us down. And if you lay a hand on law enforcement, you will face the consequences.’”President Donald Trump ordered in September to designate a decentralised movement known as antifa as a domestic terrorist organisation. Short for “anti-fascists,” antifa is not a single organisation but rather an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that confront or resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations.","US Border Patrol agents pepper-sprayed Rafael Veraza and his one-year-old daughter Arianna in the Sam’s Club parking lot in Cicero, just outside Chicago.

SNAP recipients will now not go without food support, as a US federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to deliver full benefit payments to states by Friday.In Rhode Island on Thursday, US District Judge John J. McConnell Jr. ordered the administration to disburse the payments through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, though it was unlikely the 42 million Americans — about one in eight — would see the money on their food debit cards so swiftly, AP news agency reported.The order followed a challenge by cities and non-profit organisations that the administration had proposed covering only 65 per cent of the maximum benefit, which might leave some recipients without any payment this month.“The defendants failed to consider the practical consequences associated with this decision to only partially fund SNAP,” McConnell said. “They knew that there would be a long delay in paying partial SNAP payments and failed to consider the harms individuals who rely on those benefits would suffer.”McConnell was one of two judges who ruled last week that the administration could not skip November’s benefits entirely because of the federal shutdown.Last week’s rulings required the govt to use an emergency reserve fund containing $4.6 billion to pay for SNAP for November but gave it leeway to tap other money to make the full payments, which cost between $8.5 billion and $9 billion each month.On Monday, the administration said it would not use additional funds, arguing that Congress must appropriate the programme’s money. The following day, President Trump appeared to threaten withholding the benefits entirely unless Congressional Democrats agreed to reopen the government. His press secretary later clarified that partial benefits would be paid for November and that future payments were at risk if the shutdown persisted.Late on Wednesday, the USDA, which administers the programme, filed in federal court in Rhode Island that further analysis had shown the maximum benefit would amount to just 65 per cent of the usual sum.After the US federal government shut down at the start of October, Congress was unable to approve additional spending, resulting in states not receiving funds to top up participants’ SNAP cards. The programme worked by issuing reloadable debit cards that people could use to buy essential grocery items at supermarkets or via Amazon for grocery delivery. Although states administered the programme themselves, they relied heavily on funding from the federal govt.",US judge orders full benefits to be paid to 42 million Americans by Friday. Order follows challenge by cities and non-profit organisations. Two judges ruled last week that the administration could not skip November’s benefits entirely because of the federal shutdown.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125147034,imgsize-88296,width-400,resizemode-4/representative-image-ap-photo.jpg"

Trump Takes One Last Jab at Pelosi, Calls Retirement “A Great Thing for the Country”

Nancy Pelosi's historic clashes with Trump









President Donald Trump said Nancy Pelosi's retirement will be a great thing for America as she was 'evil, corrupt and focused on bad things for our country'. Fox News reported Trump's reaction to Pelosi's retirement. ""She was rapidly losing control of her party and it was never coming back. I’m honored she impeached me twice and failed miserably twice. Nancy Pelosi is a highly overrated politician,"" Trump said as reported by Fox's Peter Doocy.The first and only female Speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi announced her retirement as she said she would not seek reelection. In a video, she said: ""I have truly loved serving as your voice in Congress, and I have always honored the song of St. Francis, ‘Lord make an instrument of thy peace,’ the anthem of our city.

The showdown entered public view in dramatic fashion in 2020 when, during Trump’s State of the Union address, Pelosi tore up a copy of his speech immediately after, calling it a “manifesto of mistruths.” After January 6, 2021, Pelosi condemned Trump's role in inciting the the mob, describing his subsequent visit to the Capitol as “returning to the scene of the crime. ”","President Donald Trump said Nancy Pelosi's retirement will be a great thing for America as she was 'evil, corrupt and focused on bad things for our country' The first and only female Speaker of the US House of Representatives announced her retirement as she said she would not seek reelection.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125137197,imgsize-906604,width-400,resizemode-4/donald-trump-said-it39s-great-news-for-america-that-nancy-pelosi-is-retiring.jpg"
'Eight planes shot down': Donald Trump adds one more plane in his India-Pakistan ceasefire claim; gives new details,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/eight-planes-shot-down-donald-trump-adds-one-more-plane-in-his-india-pakistan-ceasefire-claim-gives-new-details/articleshow/125128014.cms,"Eight Jets, Not Seven, Shot Down: Donald Trump Adds Fresh Twist to His India-Pak Ceasefire Claims





US President Donald Trump has once again reiterated his old claim that India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire after his intervention.Speaking at an event in Miami, Florida, on Wednesday, Trump added new details to his claims, saying that after his intervention, the next day he received a call claiming that they had made peace after he put out trade conditions.Trump claimed he had solved eight wars in the nine months he had been in office and played a key role in bringing India and Pakistan to a truce. “You know, I was in the midst of a trade deal with both of them (India and Pakistan), and then I read on the front page of a certain newspaper... I heard they were going to war,"" PTI news agency quoted Trump as saying, adding that a total of eight planes had been shot down during the military conflict.His previous claim stood at seven.“I said, this is war, and they are going at it. And they are two nuclear nations. I said, ‘I'm not going to make any trade deals with you guys unless you agree to peace,"" Trump said, adding that his statement took both India and Pakistan by shock.""The two nations said 'No way. This has nothing to do...’ I said, ‘It has everything to do. You are nuclear powers. I'm not trading with you. We're not making any deals with you if you're at war with each other'.""As per the claim made by Trump, this conversation with India and Pakistan took place on May 9. On May 10-2025, both countries announced they had come to a ceasefire understanding and would stop all fighting.""A day later, I get a call saying, 'We made peace'. They stopped. I said, 'Thank you. Let's do trade'. Isn't that great? Tariffs did that… Without tariffs, that would have never happened,"" Trump said amid applause.Trump’s tariff announcement had imposed a 25 percent levy on India in response to what he described as ""the highest tariffs on US goods"" and a 19 percent tariff on Pakistan. He later added an extra 25 percent on India, taking the total to 50 percent, as a penalty for New Delhi’s purchase of Russian oil and its participation in the BRICS bloc, which, according to Trump, fostered anti-American policies.India has repeatedly denied US involvement in the truce. During the G7 Summit in Canada earlier this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi rejected Trump’s claim.“President Trump clearly that during this period, there was no talk at any stage on subjects like India-US trade deal or US mediation between India and Pakistan,” said Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri in a press statement.The conflict between India and Pakistan escalated after New Delhi launched a tri-service strike called ‘ Operation Sindoor ’, targeting terror camps across Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. The operation followed a terror attack in April in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam, in which 26 tourists were killed.","US President Donald Trump has once again reiterated his old claim that India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire after his intervention.

'You Dispute, But...': Justice Alito Grills Dem Attorney On Trump Emergency Powers In Tariffs Case





DAYTON: Salman Rushdie was among the honorees Sunday at the Dayton Literary Peace Prize event in Ohio, receiving a lifetime achievement award after publishing his first work of fiction since being stabbed on a New York lecture stage three years ago.The prizes honour both literary merit and the writers' promotion of peace through their work, with separate awards annually for fiction, nonfiction and lifetime achievement.The Ohio city was the site of negotiations that led to the Dayton Peace Accords in 1995, ending a war in the Balkans marked by ethnic cleansing that killed more than 300,000 people, as well as the displacement of 1 million residents.The 78-year-old Rushdie is best known for his 1988 novel, ""The Satanic Verses,"" which prompted allegations of blasphemy and a 1989 call from Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini for the Indian-born writer's death, driving him into hiding.He was blinded in one eye from the 2022 attack before a stunned audience, and his assailant, who wasn't born when ""The Satanic Verses"" was published, was sentenced to 25 years in prison.Authorities said his attacker, Hadi Matar, then 24 and a US citizen, was attempting to carry out the decades-old edict calling for Rushdie's death when he travelled from his home in Fairview, New Jersey, to target Rushdie at the summer retreat of Chautauqua, New York, about 110 kilometers southwest of Buffalo.Rushdie published an acclaimed memoir about the attack, ""Knife,"" in 2024, a finalist for the National Book Award for Nonfiction. His most recent work, his 23rd, is ""The Eleventh Hour,"" which includes three novellas and two short stories.Other past recipients of the lifetime achievement award include former US President Jimmy Carter , Holocaust survivor and Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel, feminist movement icon Gloria Steinem and writers Margaret Atwood, John Irving, Barbara Kingsolver, and Studs Terkel.The lifetime achievement award, also known as the Ambassador Richard C. Holbrooke Distinguished Achievement Award, is named for the American diplomat who was an architect of the Dayton Peace Accords.Other honorees this year include Kaveh Akbar for his novel, ""Martyr!"" about a poet and son of Iranian immigrants dealing with a mysterious family past, and Sunil Amrith, for ""The Burning Earth,"" a history of how the global environment has been shaped by empires, wars and humanity's increasing freedom of movement.","Salman Rushdie is among the honorees at the Dayton Literary Peace Prize event in Ohio.

Five wounded in shooting outside San Francisco Safeway; Mayor Daniel Lurie says city ‘will never tolerate it’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/five-wounded-in-shooting-outside-san-francisco-safeway-mayor-lurie-says-city-will-never-tolerate-it/articleshow/125211827.cms,"



At least five people were wounded, one seriously, in a weekend shooting outside a Safeway supermarket in the Outer Richmond neighbourhood of San Francisco. Police are investigating.Officers responding to reports of gunfire around 9 pm Saturday found multiple victims near the store, the San Francisco Police Department said in a statement. A man with life-threatening injuries and four juveniles with non-life-threatening injuries were rushed to hospital.Police Capt. Kevin Lee told the San Francisco Chronicle at the scene that the shooting stemmed from a fight. There were no arrests and investigators did not immediately release suspect information.“A fight broke out shortly before 9 p.m. which resulted in the shooting. So far we have five victims that were transported to San Francisco General Hospital,” SFPD Capt. Kevin Lee said on the scene.“This kind of violence does not represent who we are as a city, and we will never tolerate it,” San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie said in a statement.The shooting sent bystanders scattering. Tommy Corcoran, 19, told the Chronicle that he was walking through Golden Gate Park near the beach when he heard what sounded like a car backfiring, then a flurry of gunfire, and suddenly saw everyone scattering, some running toward the Safeway.Corcoran slid behind a log and tried to hide, losing his phone in the process.“I’m gonna get home,” he said.Detectives urged witnesses or anyone with information to call the police department.","Five people were wounded, one seriously, in a weekend shooting outside a Safeway supermarket in the Outer Richmond neighbourhood of San Francisco.

US President Donald Trump on Sunday responded to the resignation of Tim Davie as Director‑General of the BBC. The MAGA chief thanked The Telegraph for ""exposing corrupt journalists. ""On his social‑media platform Truth Social, he posted: “The TOP people in the BBC, including TIM DAVIE, the BOSS, are all quitting/FIRED, because they were caught ‘doctoring’ my very good (PERFECT!) speech of January 6th. Thank you to The Telegraph for exposing these Corrupt ‘Journalists.’ These are very dishonest people who tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election. On top of everything else, they are from a Foreign Country, one that many consider our Number One Ally. What a terrible thing for Democracy!”Davie announced his departure on Sunday, effectively ending a 20‑year career at the corporation and five years in the top job. His exit comes amid a storm over a documentary broadcast by the BBC’s flagship series Panorama, which is alleged to have misled viewers by editing together different parts of Trump’s January 6, 2021 speech so it appeared he encouraged a violent march to the US Capitol.In reality the sequence omitted later remarks in which Trump called for peaceful protest.An internal memo by former BBC‑standards adviser Michael Prescott accused the broadcaster of “serious and systemic” bias, including over the Trump speech, coverage of the Gaza conflict and transgender issues. It was the leak of that memo to a major British newspaper that triggered both threats of parliamentary action and intense media backlash.In his resignation message, Davie said: “Overall the BBC is delivering well, but there have been some mistakes made and as director‑general I have to take ultimate responsibility.” His departure also involved the BBC’s News chief, Deborah Turness, who announced she would step away, saying the row had “reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC — an institution that I love.”Trump alleged the BBC sought to influence an American election and accused Britain’s public broadcaster of bias as a result.BBC will now work through a transition period under outgoing chair Samir Shah.","US President Donald Trump responded to the resignation of Tim Davie as Director‑General of the BBC.

Dr Amy Acton, the Democratic governor candidate for Ohio, said her rival Vivek Ramaswamy , is not running for the governor position. ""He's running for the presidency. Let's just be honest,"" Acton said on a podcast a few days ago, adding that Ramaswamy is hardly spending any time in Ohio. ""He's flying around in a corporate jet, from Columbus to Cincinnati. Can't go the 90 minutes on 71. And we are going around in an old Jeep,"" Acton said.This comes as MAGA has isolated Ramaswamy and is now pitching for his defeat in the Ohio election, one year away from now, only because of his Indian origin. Ramaswamy became a soft target in MAGA after he expressed his stance on H-1B and criticized American culture to explain why tech companies need high-skilled foreigners. This did not go down well with the MAGA.After socialist Zohran Mamdani's win in the New York mayor election, Ramaswamy issued a warning for the Republicans and said the defeat for the GOP shows that the party must shun identity politics, rise above race, religion, color of people and focus on issues that people are facing. Ramaswamy said though Mamdani's solutions are horrendous, he raised the issue of affordability which the GOP has the best solution.Vivek's sermonizing again upset the MAGA and they raised a demand for changing the GOP candidate for Ohio unless the party wants to lose the seat. One outlier poll also projected that Amy Acton has more favorability now than Ramaswamy, though Ramaswamy has bagged major endorsements.Trump asserted that there will be no change in the candidate and Vivek Ramaswamy will remain the GOP candidate. ""I know Vivek well, competed against him, and he is something SPECIAL. He is Young, Strong, and Smart! Vivek is also a very good person, who truly loves our country,"" said Trump. ""As your next Governor, Vivek will fight tirelessly to Grow the Economy, Cut Taxes and Regulations, Promote MADE IN THE USA, Champion American Energy DOMINANCE, Keep our now very Secure Border, SECURE, Stop Migrant Crime, Strengthen our Military/Veterans, Ensure LAW AND ORDER, Advance Election Integrity, and Protect our always under siege Second Amendment,"" Trump posted in a out-of-turn endorsement for Vivek.","Amy Acton, the Democratic governor candidate for Ohio, said her rival Vivek Ramaswamy is not running for the governor position.

"Federal agents detain and separate Latino father from toddler, leaving child with ‘dirty diaper, bruises and rash’; DHS justifies actions",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/federal-agents-detain-and-separate-latino-father-from-toddler-leaving-child-with-dirty-diaper-bruises-and-rash-dhs-justifies-actions/articleshow/125205371.cms,"



Democrats and immigrant rights activists are angry at federal agents after a Latino father in Los Angeles was arrested and separated from his toddler, who was later found with a dirty nappy, a bruise on her face and signs of a rash.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) rejected accusations of misconduct and said that the man himself endangered the child.The incident took place in a Home Depot car park in the Cypress Park area, where US Customs and Border Protection agents carried out an operation targeting undocumented immigrants. Witnesses said officers detained 32-year-old Dennis Quiñonez while his daughter remained strapped in her car seat inside the vehicle, reports the New York Times.What shocked onlookers was what happened next. After Quiñonez was taken to another vehicle, an armed agent climbed into the driver’s seat of his Chevy hatchback, and another agent got in beside him. “There’s a baby in the back!” someone shouted. Moments later, the agents drove away with the toddler still inside.The child was later picked up by her grandmother, who told reporters she found the girl distressed and uncomfortable.MSNBC correspondent Jacob Soboroff reported that the man who collected the child described her condition in blunt terms. “When I picked up my granddaughter from the federal agents, she had a dirty diaper, a bruise on her face, and was developing a rash. She was exhausted and cried… My heart aches knowing this could happen to others, to my kids, or even me, despite being U.S. citizens.”California Governor Gavin Newsom called the incident “sick” and demanded answers about how federal officers handled the toddler and why they transported her without any child welfare officials present.DHS officials hit back immediately. Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary at the agency, accused Newsom of spreading misinformation and defended the officers’ actions.She posted on X: “You’re peddling lies and glorifying a man who abandoned his own child in a vehicle to go and attack federal law enforcement, wielding a hammer and throwing rocks at law enforcement,” she said. She added that a stolen pistol was found inside his car and that he had an active warrant. “Law enforcement rightly looked over the child until they were in the safe custody of a guardian.”According to a federal affidavit, Quiñonez was charged with illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition due to a previous domestic violence conviction. DHS says he approached agents holding a hammer, threw two “rock-like” objects and created a dangerous environment for his daughter.Immigrant rights groups say the case shows agents are stretching legal boundaries. They argue that transporting a toddler in a detainee’s vehicle, without notifying child welfare services, breaks long-standing procedures used by other federal and local agencies.Quiñonez was freed on bond and is due in court on December 1. His family says the toddler is recovering, though still asking for her father.","Dennis Quiñonez, 32, was arrested in a Home Depot car park in Los Angeles.

FBI director Kash Patel was reportedly alarmed when someone who reports to DNI Tulsi Gabbard examined FBI case files on the Charlie Kirk shooting. Patel and other FBI officials believed that Joe Kent, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center was overstepping. This created a simmering tension between Patel and Tulsi Gabbard, as reported by the New York Times. But FBI sources pushed back on such claims and dismissed them as rumors.Joe Kent was reportedly looking for any information that ties Charlie Kirk's assassination to any foreign group -- like conspiracy theorist Candace Owens suggested -- or any terror groups. Kent had a meeting with Patel, who was not happy with Kent's digging, at the White House with Vice President JD Vance and DNI Tulsi Gabbard being present.The NYT report claimed that Kash Patel was troubled that Kent had gone through FBI materials regarding the case.Tyler Robinson was arrested on the charge of killing Charlie Kirk and FBI said he acted alone. The investigators produced his texts as evidence but many Conservative activists refuse to believe that Charlie Kirk's assassination was a one-man job, given Kirk's political importance.The NYT report said the tension between Patel's office and Gabbard's office was so intense that two meetings had to be held and little was achieved in the first meeting.""The FBI and the Justice Department generally keep tight control over evidence in criminal cases, particularly when they are preparing for a trial, in which government documents may have to be turned over to the defense and could be used to poke holes in the prosecution’s case,"" the NYT report said.Fox News reported that there was no feud and the report was exaggerated; both departments want justice for Charlie Kirk.Tyler Robinson, the accused of Charlie Kirk's assassination, has not pleaded guilty.

'If China Held U.S Citizen Hostage...': Justice Thomas Grills Dem Lawyer On Trump Tariff Authority





US President Donald Trump launched a strong defence of his tariff policies on Sunday, calling opponents “fools” and asserting that the measures have made the United States “the richest, most respected country in the world. ”His comments came on Truth Social as the US Supreme Court heard a crucial case earlier this week, examining whether the president overstepped his authority in imposing sweeping import duties.In a post on Truth Social, Trump said, “People that are against Tariffs are FOOLS! We are now the Richest, Most Respected Country In the World, With Almost No Inflation, and A Record Stock Market Price. 401k’s are the Highest EVER. We are taking in Trillions of Dollars and will soon begin paying down our ENORMOUS DEBT, $37 Trillion.”Claiming that tariffs had triggered a surge in domestic investment, Trump added that “businesses are pouring into the USA ONLY BECAUSE OF TARIFFS” and that the administration planned “a dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!).”He questioned the limits on presidential power in trade matters, stating, “So, let’s get this straight??? The President of the United States is allowed (and fully approved by Congress!) to stop ALL TRADE with a Foreign Country (Which is far more onerous than a Tariff!), and LICENSE a Foreign Country, but is not allowed to put a simple Tariff on a Foreign Country, even for purposes of NATIONAL SECURITY.That is NOT what our great Founders had in mind! The whole thing is ridiculous! Other Countries can Tariff us, but we can’t Tariff them??? It is their DREAM!!! Businesses are pouring into the USA ONLY BECAUSE OF TARIFFS. HAS THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT NOT BEEN TOLD THIS??? WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON??? “He added, “without tariffs, we have nothing of the following.”Trump’s remarks coincided with oral arguments before the US Supreme Court, where justices across the ideological spectrum raised doubts about the administration’s justification for the tariffs.According to a BBC report, several conservative justices questioned the White House’s broad application of levies under the international emergency economic powers act (IEEPA) - a 1977 law allowing presidents to regulate trade during a national emergency.Justice Amy Coney Barrett asked pointedly, “And so is it your contention that every country needed to be tariffed because of threats to the defense and industrial base? I mean, Spain? France?” She noted that if the administration lost, the US government could be forced to refund billions of dollars in collected tariffs, calling the process a potential “complete mess.”The case - seen as a major test of presidential authority - challenges whether Trump’s imposition of tariffs on goods from dozens of countries, ranging from India to France, went beyond what Congress authorised. The White House has argued that the power to “regulate” trade includes the ability to impose tariffs, with solicitor general John Sauer warning that striking down the policy could invite “ruthless trade retaliation” and cause “ruinous economic and national security consequences. ”Appearing later on Fox News, Trump said he thought the hearing “went well” and described the dispute as “one of the most important cases in the history of our country.”The Supreme Court’s ruling is expected to have sweeping implications for future presidents’ ability to unilaterally set trade policy.","US President Donald Trump defended his tariff policies on Sunday.
