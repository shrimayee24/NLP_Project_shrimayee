'We are proud of it': Two Himachal brothers marry same woman in tribal polyandry tradition; video viral,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/we-are-proud-of-it-two-himachal-brothers-marry-same-woman-in-tribal-polyandry-tradition-videos-go-viral/articleshow/122792576.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a rare yet culturally rooted event, two brothers from Himachal Pradesh’s Hatti tribe have married the same woman, reviving an age-old tradition of polyandry.The ceremony took place in Shillai village of Sirmaur district’s Trans-Giri area, with hundreds attending the three-day celebration that began on July 12.The bride, Sunita Chauhan from Kunhat village, married Pradeep and Kapil Negi in accordance with the tribal custom known as ""Jodidara"", which is recognised under Himachal Pradesh’s revenue laws.“I made this decision without any pressure. I respect the bond we have formed,” Sunita told PTI. Pradeep, who works in a government department, and Kapil, employed abroad, said the marriage was a joint, transparent decision. “We followed the tradition publicly as we are proud of it,” Pradeep told PTI. Meanwhile, Kapil said, “We’re ensuring support, stability and love for our wife as a united family.”Videos from the wedding, which featured local folk music and dance, have gone viral on social media, drawing attention to the once-prevalent tradition.The Hatti tribe, a close-knit community living along the Himachal-Uttarakhand border, was granted Scheduled Tribe status three years ago.Polyandry, though rare now, is still practised in parts of the region including Trans-Giri, Jaunsar Babar in Uttarakhand, and Kinnaur in Himachal Pradesh.According to village elders, such marriages continue discreetly and are accepted socially, though fewer in number due to growing literacy among women and economic development.Kundan Singh Shastri, general secretary of Kendriya Hatti Samiti, explained the tradition’s roots to PTI. “Polyandry helped prevent the division of ancestral land, encouraged brotherhood, and ensured a feeling of security in tribal life. It was also practical for managing scattered farmlands in the hills,” he said.In the Hatti tradition known as ""Jajda"", the bride arrives in a procession to the groom’s home where rituals including ""Seenj"" are performed. A local priest chants mantras, sprinkles holy water, and offers jaggery to the couple, blessing them with sweetness in their married life from the family deity.(with inputs from news agency PTI)","Two brothers from Himachal Pradesh’s Hatti tribe have married the same woman, reviving an age-old tradition of polyandry.

Five men linked to killing of murder convict Chandan Mishra in a Patna private hospital on July 17 were arrested in a guest house in Kolkata’s Anandapur late Saturday by a joint team of Bihar SIT and Bengal STF. A white sedan used to flee Patna was also seized.Four of them were seen on CCTV entering and exiting Room 209 on Paras HMRI Hospital’s second floor, where gangster Mishra, 36, from Bihar’s Buxar was shot multiple times. He was on parole for liver surgery. Their capture came more than 12 hours after five others were detained at a housing complex in Kolkata’s New Town for allegedly aiding the gang’s movement.All 10 are being questioned. Bihar Police identified the alleged gang leader as Tauseef Badshah and alerted Bengal counterparts with details of the fleeing vehicle seen on Durgapur Expressway. Tauseef reportedly made a phone call upon reaching New Town Friday, seeking shelter in Sukhobrishti but was turned away. He contacted a broker for accommodation, but was again denied.The group then moved to Anandapur. Traffic CCTV picked up their vehicle, prompting a raid. “All five had changed SIMs, but we tracked their new numbers using IMEI data,” said a policeman.

A Yamunanagar court has sentenced a man to seven years of rigorous imprisonment for sexually assaulting and intimidating a minor Hindu girl to coerce her into a relationship with a Muslim juvenile, terming the case one of “love jihad”. The court also imposed a fine of Rs 1 lakh on the convict and said such acts were “a potential threat” to the nation’s sovereignty and integrity.While acknowledging that ‘love jihad’ is not a legal term under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita or the Pocso Act , the court described it as a “purported campaign by Muslim men to convert non-Muslim women to Islam by pretending to be in love.”In Nov last year, a 14-yearold girl filed a complaint at City Yamunanagar police station, naming Shahbaj and a juvenile. She alleged the boy had stalked her on her way to school while Shahbaj pressured her to befriend him.The FIR invoked sections 61(2) (criminal conspiracy) and 351(2) (criminal intimidation) of BNS, and sections 17 (abetment), 8 (sexual assault) and 12 (sexual harassment of a child) under Pocso. The defence counsel, SS Nehra, argued that the accused was falsely implicated.However, additional sessions judge Ranjana Aggarwal, in her July 17 order, said Shahbaj systematically tried to force an interfaith relationship through “allurement and inducement.” The court awarded him four years under Pocso Section 8, two years under Section 12, and one year under BNS Section 351(2), with fines totalling Rs 1 lakh.

ED not a ‘loitering munition’ or ‘super cop’: Madras HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ed-not-a-loitering-munition-or-super-cop-madras-hc/articleshow/122789969.cms,"Madras high court

CHENNAI: Enforcement Directorate is not a “loitering munition or drone” that can strike at will, nor a “super cop” empowered to investigate every matter that comes to its notice, Madras HC has observed while quashing a Rs 901-crore fixed deposit freeze order issued by the agency.A division bench of Justices MS Ramesh and V Lakshminarayanan ruled that ED’s powers under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) can only be invoked when there is a scheduled offence — termed a “predicate offence” — and the existence of proceeds of crime arising from it. “PMLA demands the existence of a predicate offence.When there is no predicate offence, initiation of proceedings under PMLA is anonstarter,” the bench said. It likened ED’s jurisdiction to a limpet mine requiring a ship to function. “The ship is the predicate offence and proceeds of crime,” it added.The ruling came in response to a plea by RKM Powergen Pvt Ltd, which challenged ED’s January 31 order freezing its fixed deposits. The company, represented by senior advocate B Kumar, said the freeze disregarded earlier court rulings and lacked fresh material. RKMP was allocated the Fatehpur East coal block in 2006.The Supreme Court cancelled the allocation in 2014.CBI initially registered an FIR but closed the case in 2017. Despite this, ED launched a PMLA probe in 2015 and froze RKMP’s accounts, which was struck down by Madras HC earlier. Rejecting ED’s stand, HC said actions under PMLA must follow legally prescribed route and termed the freeze order “legally untenable.”",Madras HC quashes a Rs 901-crore fixed deposit freeze order issued by the agency.

'Friendship, Huglomacy': Jairam Ramesh Slams Modi Over Trump’s 'Jets-Down' Claim | Monsoon Session

BJP's reaction

Also read:

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s silence following fresh comments made by US President Donald Trump about mediating a ceasefire between India and Pakistan.This time, Trump went a step ahead and claimed that ‘five jets were shot down’ in the conflict.Sharing a video of Trump’s remarks, Gandhi posted on X: “Modi ji, what is the truth about the 5 jets? The nation has a right to know!”Rahul’s post came as Trump, in what is now his 24th such claim, said at a private Republican dinner that he helped stop a war between India and Pakistan using trade threats. Trump claimed that “planes were being shot out of the air… five, five, four or five, but I think five jets were shot down, actually.”Senior Congress leader and Rajya Sabha MP P Chidambaram also criticised the government’s silence.“After President Trump’s latest statement, what does the government of India have to say? Silence is no answer,” he wrote on X.“I would like to believe the government of India, but if the government does not state the truth — does not say anything at all on the outcomes of the 5-day war — what do we believe?”, he added.Responding sharply to Rahul Gandhi’s post, BJP’s IT cell head Amit Malviya accused the Congress leader of echoing anti-India sentiments.In a post on X, Malviya wrote, “Rahul Gandhi’s mindset is that of a traitor.” He argued that Trump never explicitly mentioned India while speaking about the downing of five jets, and questioned why Gandhi assumed the aircraft belonged to India.“Why not assume they were Pakistan’s? Does he have more sympathy for Pakistan than for his own country?” Malviya asked.Taking a direct swipe, he added, “Whenever the country’s army teaches the enemy a lesson, Congress gets riled up. Anti-India sentiment is no longer just a habit for Congress; it’s become their identity.” Malviya ended his attack by questioning Gandhi’s allegiance: “Rahul Gandhi, tell us — are you Indian or Pakistan’s spokesperson?”The Congress party earlier said PM Modi’s silence was a compromise of India’s national honour.“Trump keeps repeating this, and PM Modi remains silent. Why is the nation’s honour being bartered for trade?” the party posted.Congress MP Jairam Ramesh also weighed in and said that the PM must make a statement in Parliament. “Just two days before the Monsoon Session of Parliament begins, the Trump missile gets fired for the 24th time,” he said, highlighting Trump’s repeated claims that a potential nuclear conflict was stopped due to US pressure linked to trade talks.Ramesh also referred to PM Modi’s past closeness with Trump, including events like ‘Howdy Modi’ in 2019 and ‘Namaste Trump’ in 2020. “The Prime Minister must respond himself in Parliament. No substitute batsman will do,” he added.Trump has claimed multiple times that he used trade pressure to stop escalating tensions following the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 people.India responded with Operation Sindoor on May 7, striking nine terror camps. Pakistan retaliated with drones and missiles, which were intercepted by Indian air defences.India later targeted 11 Pakistani airbases in precision strikes.Though Trump insists his trade warnings helped prevent further escalation, India maintains that the ceasefire came after Pakistan’s director general of military operations reached out to his Indian counterpart.",Congress leader Rahul Gandhi questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s silence following fresh comments made by US President Donald Trump about mediating a ceasefire between India and Pakistan.

NEW DELHI: Demonstrating unity over the parliamentary agenda, opposition Saturday said its demand for discussion on Pahalgam terror attack-Operation Sindoor and “drift” in foreign policy is non-negotiable, and PM Narendra Modi should reply to the debate — an apparent red line that threatens a stormy monsoon session which gets under way Monday. The opposition has listed the controversial “special intensive review” of Bihar electoral rolls as another major issue for discussion.The opposition argued that US President Donald Trump has been speaking non-stop about having forced cessation of hostilities between India and Pakistan by using trade as the bait, and only PM Modi, who has allegedly been silent on the issue, can reply to him.Just how much is govt willing to accommodate the opposition’s demand — subjects of discussion, duration of debate, PM’s reply — would decide the trajectory of the monsoon session. But the govt appears to have made up its line of defence for the opposition’s charge on Pahalgam-Sindoor. Official sources said the treasury will focus on how it has shown “zero tolerance” towards terrorism and its sponsors, and didn’t hesitate to target the terror hideouts deep inside Pakistan territory. They refuted allegation that PM has been silent on Trump’s mediation claim, pointing out that in a one-on-one telephonic chat the PM had rejected Trump’s assertion that he leaned on a reluctant India to suspend Operation Sindoor , pointing out that India decided to pause fire on May 10 after Pakistan conveyed its willigness to do so through military channels.Although the expected confrontation can potentially disturb govt’s plan to get eight bills passed, it has in the recent past been able to achieve its legislative agenda by working around protests.The INDIA bloc Saturday evening brainstormed on issues of “national concern” in a virtual meeting, that saw the participation of 24 parties and included Mallikarjun Kharge, Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, K C Venugopal, Sharad Pawar, Uddhav Thackeray, Dipankar Bhattacharya (CPI-ML), N K Premachandran (RSP), Abhishek Banerjee (TMC), Tejashwi Yadav (RJD), Ramgopal Yadav (SP), Omar Abdullah (NC), Hemant Soren (JMM) and Tiruchi Siva (DMK). Rahul is learnt to have pushed for a united fight in Parliament.Aam Aadmi Party which had decided to disengage itself from the opposition grouping, did not attend the meeting.Another contentious issue in the session would be the “attack on migrants across the country”. TMC’s Banerjee, CPI (ML)’s Bhattacharya, and other netas highlighted that migrants from Bengal and other regions were being attacked. They linked it to the voters’ review. The discussion on migrants and voters rolls in the meeting suggests opposition may be unrelenting on the SIR.BJP is sure to return fire by saying that the scrutiny of voters was consistent with the Constitution which lays down that only Indian citizens have the right to vote, and by accusing the oppoosition of trying to shield infiltrators from Bangladesh as part of their “votebank politics”.Amid the differences between the govt and the opposition, a rare bipartisanship will see the Lok Sabha bring a motion to impeach Justice Yashwant Varma for alleged corruption. But even here, a fresh faultline is the pendency of the impeachment notice submitted by the opposition against Justice Shekhar Yadav of Allahahad HC for “hate speech”. While the opposition is pushing for Yadav’s sacking, the govt is reluctant to entertain it.",The opposition has listed the controversial “special intensive review’ of Bihar electoral rolls as another major issue for discussion.

There are 105 families on the island and many have opposed the move.The Lakshadweep revenue department has issued a notification, dated July 11, for a social impact assessment (SIA). It stated that the intention was to transfer the entire island to defence and strategic agencies considering its “strategic location” and “national security relevance”.Lakshadweep MP Hamdullah Sayeed alleged that the move was aimed at disrupting peace in the area and would be opposed tooth and nail.Lakshadweep MP vows to fight for Bitra islandersIn a video message, Lakshadweep MP Hamdullah Syeed asked Bitra natives not to worry or be anxious about the notification.“As your MP, we held a conference that included leaders from Bitra and Lakshadweep and discussed it in detail. We have decided to fight with the people of Bitra, politically and legally,” he said.Sayeed said the government had already acquired land required for defence purposes on several islands.Targeting Bitra, which has had an indigenous population for decades, without considering any alternative, is unacceptable. He also criticised the administration for not holding any consultation with the islanders.The notification said that a Social Impact Assessment (SIA) was needed as per provisions of the Right to Fair Compensation and Trans- parency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013. Naming the department of revenue as the project developer, it said SIA activities included consultations with all stakeholders of the proposed area, including the gram sabha.“The SIA and Consent Society, UT of Lakshadweep, will complete the survey of the proposed area under acquisition within two months from the date of the notification,” it said, adding that consent of gram sabhas and/or landowners was not mandatory.","The Lakshadweep revenue department has issued a notification, dated July 11, for a social impact assessment (SIA) The intention was to transfer the entire island to defence and strategic agencies considering its ‘strategic location’ and ‘national security relevance’ There are 105 families on the island.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122772958,imgsize-2953706,width-400,resizemode-4/122772958.jpg"

NEW DELHI: A new development came in the Balashore self-immolation case, where the victim's friend on Friday claimed that the HoD threatened to fail her if she didn't fulfil his demands and accused the principal of provoking her to reach such an extent that she killed herself.The victim, a 20-year-old second-year B.Ed student at Fakir Mohan (Autonomous) College, Balasore, died after setting herself ablaze on July 12 outside the college gate during a peaceful protest that had been ongoing since July 1, demanding action against the head of the education department.The B.Ed student's friend Koshish Das also said that the HoD has been doing this for six months with her.""All of this was going on with her for six months... On 30 June, she told us that the HoD had stooped to the extent of telling her, 'I will fail you. I will keep you in this class for six years.

She told us that she wants support to go and talk to the principal about this.

She kept waiting outside the principal's chamber, since there was a large crowd for admissions. We waited there for two hours, but then we told her, 'Let's have our lunch, and afterwards we can talk to the principal.' But before we could come back, we were told that she had lit herself on fire. By the time we got back, the college had been sealed, and I couldn't even see what condition she was in.

These students were in opposition to her (the victim), since she was in ABVP.

BHUBANESWAR/PURI: Three men on a bike waylaid a 15-year-old girl a kilometre from her home, poured kerosene over her and set her afire, in Odisha's Puri district on Saturday. The girl is fighting for her life at AIIMS Bhubaneswar. A 14-member medical team has been formed for her treatment.The attack took place around 8:30am, when the girl, a Class IX dropout, was walking to a relative's house. The accused forcibly took her to the banks of Bhargavi river, set her ablaze and fled as she screamed in pain.The girl ran towards a house and asked for help. ""I was shocked to see her on fire. I doused the flames... I enquired about her family and asked them to come immediately. Then, we called an ambulance and police. They took her to hospital,"" said a man who helped the teen first.AIIMS Bhubaneswar executive director Ashutosh Biswas said the girl's condition is critical.

PDP accuses NC govt of excluding Urdu from land records digitisation process,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pdp-accuses-nc-govt-of-excluding-urdu-from-land-records-digitisation-process/articleshow/122787091.cms,"PDP's Waheed Parra; CM Omar Abdullah

Srinagar: Urdu has become the latest political hot potato in Jammu and Kashmir. After the row over mandatory knowledge of the language for naib tehsildar recruitments, People’s Democratic Party (PDP) legislator Waheed Parra on Saturday accused Omar Abdullah-led National Conference govt of digitising the land records in English, instead of Urdu.Parra claimed the NC govt, with chief minister Omar holding the revenue portfolio, has ordered “another round of land record digitisation” across J&K. “This time, the process is being carried out exclusively in English, with Urdu, a language that has been integral to our revenue records for generations, completely removed,” he said.Earlier, long before the 2024 govt formation, the J&K administration had allegedly given “a multi-crore land digitisation contract” to one company, Parra said. “The company scanned every single land document across districts, but digitised only Srinagar and Jammu in three years. The rest were rushed by overburdened revenue staff for months,” he alleged.The PDP MLA also questioned the CM’s silence on the issue.Govt has not come up with any response on the issue so far. “We will check it,” a govt spokesperson said, when asked.Last month, a controversy erupted after J&K Services Selection Board issued a notification for naib tehsildar posts in the revenue department, making knowledge of Urdu, one of the five official languages of J&K, a mandatory requirement.BJP strongly protested the decision and termed it discriminatory.Earlier this month, the Central Administrative Tribunal’s Jammu bench stayed the mandatory Urdu clause in an interim order on a petition.PDP president and former CM Mehbooba Mufti led the charge against the order, calling it “deeply unfortunate”. In a post on X, she said: “Urdu, a recognised official language for decades, is now being unfairly communalised. Our revenue records and administrative work continue to be maintained in Urdu, and it is only logical that applicants for the post of naib tehsildar possess basic proficiency in the language. This requirement is rooted purely in administrative efficiency, not in any form of divisiveness. ”","PDP legislator Waheed Parra accused Omar Abdullah-led National Conference govt of digitising the land records in English, instead of Urdu.

Royal reaction and wider probe



Not the first scandal







Thailand’s Buddhist clergy is facing a major crisis after a sex and extortion scandal involving at least 11 monks came to light this week.The monks are accused of breaking their celibacy vows and using temple donations to pay hush money to a woman who blackmailed them.Police say the woman seduced the monks, secretly recorded their sexual acts, and then demanded millions to stay quiet. The scandal involves nearly $12 million in temple funds and is the money donated by worshippers hoping to earn spiritual merit.The case has shocked many Thais, as Buddhism plays a central role in the country’s culture. “I used to respect the monks,” said Mongkol Sudathip, a 33-year-old motorbike taxi driver. “But not anymore.”King Maha Vajiralongkorn cancelled the attendance of over 80 monks at his upcoming birthday event, calling their behaviour “inappropriate” and damaging to public trust. The National Office of Buddhism said all monks involved have been defrocked, and a full police investigation is now underway.Police chief Kitrat Panphet claimed that the scandal does not represent the whole religion, only a few individuals who broke the rules.A new task force is being formed to look deeper into misconduct within temples.In an interview, the woman at the centre of the scandal admitted she spent up to $90,000 a day while going on luxury shopping trips with monks. Monks in Thailand are supposed to live simply on alms and a monthly stipend of about $170. However, many earn extra money by performing blessings and religious ceremonies, blurring the line between religious duty and personal wealth.“I now donate to hospitals and schools,” said Mongkol. “It feels more meaningful than giving to temples.”This isn’t the first time the monkhood has faced criticism. In 2017, a former abbot was arrested for laundering $33 million. Earlier this year, another monk was accused of embezzling nearly $10 million to fund gambling.Experts say public trust is wearing thin. Scholar Danai Preechapermprasit said, “People are beginning to question where their donations go.”Despite growing doubt, many still separate their belief in Buddhism from the actions of individual monks. “You can lose trust in monks,” said Camphun Parimiphut, a 52-year-old security guard. “But the teachings still guide us.”","Monks accused of using temple donations to pay hush money to a woman who blackmailed them.

UP cops ban kanwariyas from carrying trishuls and hockey sticks during yatra,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/ban-on-tridents-hockey-sticks-on-kanwar-yatra-route-after-spate-of-violent-incidents/articleshow/122788591.cms,"



MEERUT: Uttar Pradesh police has banned kanwariyas from carrying sticks, tridents (trishuls), hockey sticks, and similar items during the kanwar yatra. The ban covers major districts along the yatra route, including Meerut, Muzaffarnagar, Shamli, Saharanpur, Bulandshahr, Hapur, and Baghpat. Authorities have also prohibited the use of motorbikes without silencers to curb noise pollution and public nuisance.The move follows several incidents of vandalism and harassment involving kanwariyas, both in UP and in Uttarakhand, where the pilgrims travel to Haridwar to collect holy Ganga water.Authorities have now made it clear that displays of weapons -- even if symbolic -- and carrying them will not be tolerated. ADG (Meerut Zone) Bhanu Bhaskar told TOI, ""The govt has issued clear directives prohibiting it. We are enforcing these strictly, and FIRs are being registered against violators.""The police action has come following numerous incidents this year along the pilgrimage route that have seen kanwariyas involved in violent altercations and skirmishes. In one recent case in Meerut's Pallavpuram, a group of kanwariyas from Delhi were filmed brandishing swords.One of them, Suraj Kumar, said, ""We carry swords for safety, especially through forested areas. This one isn't even blunt.""The same week, enraged pilgrims vandalised a school bus in Meerut after it accidentally grazed one of them. An FIR was filed against unidentified pilgrims from Ghaziabad.Later in Muzaffarnagar, members of a Hindu outfit allegedly tried to strip an eatery worker during an ""identity check"" , sparking outrage. Days after that, kanwariyas ransacked a local eatery after being served onions, damaging furniture and wrecking the kitchen.In Haridwar, a viral video showed kanwariyas assaulting a woman after her scooty brushed past a pilgrim. The video captured them abusing her, dragging her by the hair, and beating her. An FIR was filed under BNS sections for rioting, causing hurt, and assault on a woman following public outrage.Meanwhile, as part of the crackdown after the ban was announced, Muzaffarnagar police have seized 24 noisy bikes and fined 60 riders for lacking silencers. ""Only after installing proper silencers were they allowed to proceed,"" said a police officer.","Ban covers major districts along the yatra route, including Meerut, Muzaffarnagar, Shamli, Saharanpur, Bulandshahr, Hapur, and Baghpat.

JAIPUR: Two days after the decomposed bodies of 67-year-old retired army officer Gopal Verma and his 62-year-old wife Nirmala Verma were found in their locked home in Bikaner's Muktaprasad Colony, police Friday arrested three people, including a couple who once lived in the house as tenants.Police said the murder was carried out by six people, including the couple, the woman's father and brother, and two others who were hired by the father from Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh on July 13 between 9pm and 10pm.The accused strangled the elderly couple and fled with jewellery and cash, the exact amount of which is yet to be established.IG Bikaner Om Prakash said that those arrested have been identified as Arun Kumar, 28, a resident of Dharma Nagar Dwar, Naya Shahar in Bikaner; Rohit Bansal, 24, from Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh; and Priya Sisodia, 23.Police said Priya lived with Arun in a live-in relationship in Vermas' house as tenants during Dec, Jan and Feb. Her father, Karmaveer Sisodia, and brother, Priyanshu, often visited them and stayed in the house from time to time. They befriended the elderly couple, claiming they were performing occult practices to help them, and gradually gained the couple's trust.Add SP Bikaner Saurabh Tiwari said that the gang conspired to rob the couple after learning that they lived alone.""On July 13, Karmaveer Sisodia, his associate Sumit from Ghaziabad, Rohit Bansal, and others entered the house and strangled the couple before ransacking the home and escaping with valuables,"" the officer said.Three others, including Karmaveer Sisodia and Sumit, named in the FIR are still on the run. Efforts were underway to trace them.Police said suspicion first fell on the former tenants. Arun Kumar's behaviour during questioning raised doubts; he booked Priya into a hotel in Bikaner under his own identity and tried to mislead investigators. He also deleted his call records, further deepening suspicion. Mobile location data and hotel records eventually helped police connect the dots and confirm his involvement.Police teams continue to search multiple locations to recover the missing jewellery and cash. The elderly couple lived alone in their house in Sector 4/11 of Muktaprasad Colony in Bikaner. Both their sons work in different multinational companies. One of them lives in Noida, while the other lives in Canada.According to police, Gopal Verma's son, who lives in Noida, repeatedly tried to call them on July 15 but received no response. Concerned, he asked his uncle, who lives nearby, to check on them. It was then that the elderly couple's bodies were discovered.","Arun Kumar, 28, Rohit Bansal, 24, and Priya Sisodia, 23, arrested in Bikaner.

Poll Do you think it's important to investigate unexpected deaths thoroughly, even if family members don't suspect foul play? Yes No





NEW DELHI: The death of a 36-year-old man, initially believed to have been due to accidental electrocution, is now the subject of a murder investigation after Delhi Police found signs of foul play.His wife who allegedly rushed him to the hospital has been apprehended.The victim, Karan Dev, a resident of Om Vihar in west Delhi, who owned an artificial jewellery business, was brought to the hospital on July 13 by his wife, who claimed he had suffered an electric shock.He was declared brought dead by the hospital authorities and later shifted to Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital for a post-mortem.The family said they didn't suspect foul play and even expressed their wish to waive off the post-mortem.However, given the relatively young age of the deceased and the unclear circumstances of his death, police decided to proceed with the autopsy.The case took a turn on July 16 when Dev's brother, Kunal, approached the cops and told them of his suspicions about the nature of his brother's death. ""Following Kunal's statement, a preliminary inquiry was conducted. Based on the findings of the inquest proceedings and other material evidence, a case was registered, including that of murder,"" a police officer said.During the investigation, police found inconsistencies in the statements and evidence, which suggested that the electrocution might not have been accidental. Police sources disclosed the information that the wife had come to the hospital in a panic, but certain details hadn't added up when she reported the tragedy.Forensic and circumstantial analysis pointed to possible foul play. Subsequently, the cops apprehended Dev's wife and his brother-in-law. They are currently being questioned in connection with the incident. A police source suggested that the victim allegedly suspected his wife of an extramarital affair. This could be one motive for his murder, but the cops are looking at other possible motives too.","Karan Dev, 36, was brought to the hospital on July 13 by his wife, who claimed he had suffered an electric shock.

'They were best friends':Jeffrey Epstein's ex girlfriend Stacey Williams on Trump-Epstein bond; describes duo as ‘bro’ and ‘wingman’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/they-were-best-friendsjeffrey-epsteins-ex-girlfriend-stacey-williams-on-trump-epstein-bond-describes-duo-as-bro-and-wingman/articleshow/122793304.cms,"Former model Stacey Williams (Image: X/@JoshTBoswell) and US President Donald Trump (PTI image)





Stacey Williams, former girlfriend of Jeffrey Epstein has claimed that the disgraced financier and Donald Trump were “best friends” and “up to no good” during their long-standing friendship, as the US president continues to distance himself from the Epstein scandal.Williams had briefly dated Epstein for several months in the 1990s. She made these remarks in an interview with CNN aired Friday evening. “That was his bro, that was his wingman,” she said, describing Trump’s close relationship with Epstein.“The only friend that he would mention every time we saw each other or had a phone conversation was Donald,” she said. “They were very close and they were up to no good.”Her comments come as the department of justice continues to review documents related to the Epstein case and just days after the DOJ asked a court to unseal grand jury transcripts in the Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell investigations.In a previous interview with The Guardian in October, Williams publicly accused Trump of groping her in Epstein’s presence. Trump has denied the allegations. He has also threatened to sue The Wall Street Journal over its report on a letter allegedly bearing his signature in Jeffrey Epstein’s 2003 birthday album, calling the document “fake.”During the interview, CNN host Brianna Keilar read the contents of the birthday letter.Trump has dismissed the note as “fake” and claimed he never “wrote a picture” in his life, a phrase Williams mocked in her reaction. “What, are you kidding me? I know what they were up to together. It happened to me.”Williams also referenced a postcard she says Trump sent to her agent in 1993, shortly after the alleged assault. According to The Guardian, the card showed an aerial view of Mar-a-Lago and included a handwritten message: “Stacey – Your home away from home. Love Donald.”Recalling the alleged incident in Trump Tower, Williams said Epstein led her to Trump’s office, where Trump allegedly began groping her while carrying on a casual conversation with Epstein.“They were back and forth smiling and grinning and carrying on a conversation while Donald ran his hands all over me. Assistants were walking back and forth while the incident occurred"", she said.“If it happens in a dark alleyway, you defend yourself. But when it's hidden in its brazenness like that, which is Donald Trump's forte, you go into shock,” Williams told the network. “So I froze and it was over very quickly. It was a few minutes.”As she and Epstein got into an elevator to leave, she realized “Jeffrey's energy had changed.” Williams recalled: “He was, he was like seething, he was enraged. He wouldn’t make eye contact with me.”After the encounter, Williams said Epstein blamed the incident on her. She remembered: “He looked at me and he just started yelling at me saying, ‘Why did you let him do that?’”She had the same thought herself. “I remember thinking like, ‘Why did I?’ I felt like I was coming back into my body at that moment and I was confused,” she said.When she first came forward with her assault accusations, Williams said she believed the incident was “coordinated” between the two men.Trump’s friendship with Epstein began in the late 1980s and lasted through the early 2000s. His contact details, as well as those of First Lady Melania Trump were included in Epstein’s infamous leaked address books. Flight records show Trump flew on Epstein’s private jet at least seven times.Their friendship reportedly ended around 2004 over a property dispute. In 2005, the FBI began investigating Epstein for child sex trafficking. He pleaded guilty to a state charge of soliciting sex from a minor in 2008, as reported by the Independent.Trump distanced himself from his former friend after Epstein’s arrest in 2019, during his first term as president. He has denied any wrongdoing related to the case.","Former model Stacey Williams claims Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein were 'best friends' and 'up to no good' Williams dated Epstein for several months in the 1990s.

The gang, led by Pavittar Singh, wanted in India for multiple murders, targeted Indian-Americans.

8 Indian-origin suspects face life in jail without bail





JALANDHAR: Investigating the eight Indian-origin suspects arrested in San Joaquin County, California, on July 11, county authorities and FBI said the international Punjabi street gang kidnapped a local man, stripped him naked, and tortured him for hours as part of a brutal extortion racket that stretches from California'to murder plots in India.The authorities have urged Indian-Americas to report such extortion threats.Addressing a joint press conference, they revealed the gang leader, Pavittar Singh, was also wanted in India for multiple murders and firearms offences, including a killing in Batala, Punjab.FBI also cited earlier US arrests of Indian gang leaders: Gurdev 'Jassal' Singh (RPG attacks), Harpreet Singh, also known as Happy Passia, Lawrence Bishnoi's brother Anmol , linked to the murder of singer Sidhu Moose Wala, and others.Eight suspects, led by Pavittar, now face charges of kidnapping for ransom, torture and illegal weapons that carry life sentences. A multi-agency SWAT sweep on July 11 had netted machine guns, an assault rifle, and $15,000 cash stashed in a ceiling vent.Sheriff Patrick Withrow said they were tipped off on June 21 about a horrendous crime that occurred on June 19 in the Manteca area.They contacted the victim and, on July 11, their AGNET Unit — alongside SWAT teams from FBI, Stockton police, Manteca police and Stanislaus County sheriff's office — executed five coordinated search warrants across the county and arrested the suspects.Withrow said the purpose of the torture was to extract names of other potential extortion targets in the Indian-American business community.Elaborating on the federal and international angle, Sid Patel from FBISacramento field office said Pavittar was wanted in India for firearm violations, assault and multiple murders abroad. He revealed six of the eight suspects were picked up by ICE ERO for immigration proceedings, and FBI was coordinating with India and Canada on extradition after US sentences.San Joaquin County District Attorney Ron Freitas told the press conference that they filed two complaints charging the eight men with serious gang-related crimes, including kidnapping, torture, extortion, witness intimidation, and multiple weapon violations. They said the suspects faced life in prison, with no bail and no exceptions.Apart from Pavitar, other members of the gang included Dilpreet Singh, Sarbjit Singh, Gurtaj Singh, Amritpall Singh, Vishal Singh, Arshpreet Singh, and Manpreet Randhawa. According to the sheriff and FBI, the gang operations included extortion of Indian-American business owners, forced free labour, violent truck cargo hijackings along Central Valley, weapons and drug trafficking, and international political violence (RPG attacks, assassinations, grenade assaults on police stations in India).Each of the accused faces a life-in-prison baseline for kidnapping for ransom, along with firearm and gang enhancements that could push to life without parole. The sheriff even said, ""Suspects are animals with little or no regard for human life.""Announcing the setting up of an anonymous tip line specifically for this case, the sheriff urged Indian-American residents to report extortion and intimidation attempts. ""Help us hunt the rest of this gang — call us.""","8 Indian-origin suspects face life in jail without bail for kidnapping for ransom, torture and illegal weapons.

US President on Saturday backed director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard for calling out the prosecution of former President Barack Obama and senior members of his administration, accusing ""thugs"" of working together to hurt Donald Trump ’s win in the 2016 election and damage his presidency afterward.In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump praised journalists of Fox News and said that they were fantastic on prosecuting Obama and the “thugs” over election fraud.""Great job by young and talented Harrison Fields on FoxNews. The Panel was fantastic on prosecuting Obama and the “thugs” who have just been unequivocally exposed on highest level Election Fraud. Congratulations to Tulsi Gabbard. Keep it coming!!!"" Trump said.Gabbard appeared on ""Hannity"" Friday night where she asserted that former President Barack Obama's goal with the Russia collusion narrative was to ""subvert the American people's will"" in the 2016 presidential election.Gabbard declassified the report on the Obama administration's Russia hoax on Friday, revealing ""overwhelming evidence"" that demonstrates how, after President Donald Trump won the 2016 election against Hillary Clinton, then-President Barack Obama and his national security team laid the groundwork for what would be the years-long Trump–Russia collusion probe.Earlier, the DNI released a statement, said there is ""overwhelming evidence"" ""overwhelming evidence,"" showing that following Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton, Obama and his national security team ""manufactured and politicised intelligence"" to establish groundwork for what she characterised as an extended attempt to remove Trump from office.""The issue I am raising is not a partisan issue. It is one that concerns every American,"" Gabbard said. ""The information we are releasing today clearly shows there was a treasonous conspiracy in 2016 committed by officials at the highest level of our government.""Gabbard indicated that all associated documentation would be submitted to the department of justice for criminal review. She emphasised that ""no matter how powerful, every person involved in this conspiracy must be investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law"".The statement identifies senior officials, including then-DNI James Clapper, CIA director John Brennan, national security adviser Susan Rice, secretary of state John Kerry, attorney general Loretta Lynch, and FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, who attended a high-level National Security Council meeting on December 9, 2016, at the White House. Gabbard contends this meeting initiated a new Intelligence Community assessment at Obama's request to attribute election interference to Russia.According to Gabbard, intelligence assessments prior to the election had determined that Russia was ""probably not trying ... to influence the election by cyber means"". A December 7, 2016 internal memo additionally stated, ""Foreign adversaries did not use cyberattacks on election infrastructure to alter the US Presidential election outcome.""Following the White House meeting, Clapper's executive assistant instructed agencies including the CIA, FBI, NSA and DHS to prepare a new IC assessment regarding Russian interference, noting it was ""per the President's request"".Gabbard stated that Obama officials provided ""false statements"" to outlets such as The Washington Post, incorrectly asserting Russian interference in the election outcome. A January 6, 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment reportedly contradicted previous findings spanning several months.She asserted this revised assessment utilised unreliable or ""manufactured"" sources, including the subsequently discredited Steele Dossier. Gabbard indicated this led to various consequences, including the Mueller investigation, Trump's two impeachments, arrests of senior officials, and increased Russian tensions.""Their egregious abuse of power and blatant rejection of our Constitution threatens the very foundation and integrity of our democratic republic,"" Gabbard said. ""The American people's faith and trust in our democratic republic and therefore the future of our nation depends on it.""This development occurs amidst increased Republican examination of the Trump-Russia investigation's origins, following recent intelligence record releases through her office.","US President on Saturday backed director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard for calling out the prosecution of former President Barack Obama and senior members of his administration.

A Mexican national accused of decapitating a missing Illinois woman and hiding her body in a bleach-filled container was re-arrested by US immigration authorities on Saturday (local time) in Chicago, months after he was released from custody despite facing serious charges.Jose Luis Mendoza-Gonzalez, a 52-year-old resident of Waukegan, Illinois, was first arrested in April after police discovered the body of 37-year-old Megan Bos in a container in his backyard. He was charged with concealing a corpse, abusing a corpse and obstruction of justice, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).However, shortly after his first court appearance, Lake County Judge Randie Bruno released Mendoza-Gonzalez under the provisions of Illinois' Safety, Accountability, Fairness and Equity-Today (SAFE-T) Act. The decision drew sharp criticism from public officials who questioned the release of someone accused of such a heinous crime.On Saturday, Mendoza-Gonzalez was taken back into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents at a market in Chicago. He now remains in ICE detention, DHS confirmed.The body of Megan Bos, who had been reported missing on March 9, was found in April. According to her family, she was last seen in February.Investigators allege that Mendoza-Gonzalez kept Bos’s body in his basement for two days before moving it to the yard, where it remained concealed for nearly two months.DHS officials said that Bos had been decapitated and her remains were found inside a container filled with bleach.""It is absolutely repulsive this monster walked free on Illinois’ streets after allegedly committing such a heinous crime,"" a DHS spokesperson said. ""Megan Bos and her family will have justice,"" as reported by Fox News.After Mendoza-Gonzalez's release in April, Antioch Mayor Scott Gartner criticized the laws that allowed the suspect’s release.""I was shocked to find out literally the next day that the person that they had arrested for this had been released from prison under the SAFE-T Act less than, detained less, I think, than 48 hours,"" Gartner said.Gartner emphasized that there are several other serious factors in this case, including the nature of the crime, how long it was hidden, and the fact that the suspect is not a US citizen and could potentially flee the country.Mendoza-Gonzalez reportedly told authorities that Bos had overdosed at his home. Instead of calling 911, he allegedly broke her phone and kept her body in the basement for two days before moving it outside.Republican State Representative Tom Weber also expressed his concern about Mendoza-Gonzalez's release in April.""Someone that hid their body in a garbage can for 51 days after leaving it in the basement for two days, after not calling 911 [and] breaking a phone. Is this a non-detainable offense?"" Weber said.

Putin Military SHATTERS Ukrainian Defences; Russia UNLEASHES Hellfire With Record 300 Drones





Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Saturday announced that Kyiv has proposed a fresh round of peace talks with Russia next week aiming to revive efforts toward a ceasefire after previous negotiations broke down in early June. He stated that the dynamics of negotiations must improve and stressed the need to do everything possible to achieve a ceasefire.Speaking during his daily evening address, Zelenskyy said that Ukraine’s National Security and Defence Council Secretary, Rustem Umerov, has already proposed the next meeting with the Russian side for next week, as reported by CNN.“The dynamics of the negotiations must improve. We need to do everything possible to achieve a ceasefire. The Russian side must stop avoiding decisions regarding prisoner exchanges, the return of children, and the cessation of killings,” Zelenskyy said.“A meeting at the leadership level is essential to genuinely secure peace. Ukraine is ready for such a meeting,” he added.The proposal comes after two previous rounds of talks in Istanbul has failed to achieve any significant progress. While those discussions led to prisoner exchanges and returning the bodies of killed soldiers, no definite steps were taken to stop the conflict.According to Russian state media, Russia had presented strict territorial demands as a condition for a ceasefire. Ukraine has made it clear that it will not accept giving up any of its territory in return for peace.Umerov, a former defence minister of Ukraine, was appointed last week as the new head of the National Security and Defence Council. He has been assigned the responsibility of giving new momentum to the negotiation process and is expected to play an important role in future diplomatic efforts with Moscow, according to The Guardian.Russia has continued a heavy military offensive along the eastern front in Ukraine’s Donetsk region. It has repeatedly stated that it is open to a new round of talks but has not withdrawn its strict war demands.During last month’s discussions, Russia presented a list of tough conditions, including demands for Ukraine to give up more territory and to stop accepting any western military support.Kyiv rejected these demands as unacceptable and questioned the purpose of further negotiations if Moscow was not willing to make compromises.The call for renewed talks also follows recent pressure from the United States. President Donald Trump earlier this month gave Russia a 50-day deadline to reach a peace agreement with Kyiv or face severe economic consequences, including high tariffs on Russian exports and “secondary tariffs” on goods from countries that purchase Russian oil.“We’re going to be doing very severe tariffs if we don’t have a deal in 50 days,” Trump said during a meeting with Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte in the Oval Office earlier this week.“I use trade for a lot of things,” Trump added. “But it’s great for settling wars.”The US president also pledged to supply Kyiv with new military aid, sponsored by Nato allies, as its cities suffer ever-increasing Russian aerial attacks.",Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that Kyiv has proposed a fresh round of peace talks with Russia next week.

Prince Al-Waleed bin Khaled bin Talal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, widely known across Saudi Arabia and the Arab world as the “Sleeping Prince,” passed away on Saturday, July 19, at the age of 36, after nearly two decades in a coma. The Royal Court announced his death through the Saudi Press Agency, confirming the end of a long and deeply emotional chapter in the life of the Saudi royal family.Prince Al-Waleed’s story has resonated with many over the years, drawing prayers, sympathy, and attention across the region. His passing marks the conclusion of an extraordinary and tragic journey that began with a life full of promise and was later defined by unwavering hope, faith, and familial devotion.Born in April 1990, Prince Al-Waleed was the eldest son of Prince Khaled bin Talal Al Saud and the nephew of billionaire businessman Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal. As a young man, he was a military cadet studying in London, preparing for a future in service. However, in 2005, at just 15 years old, his life took a sudden and devastating turn when he suffered a car accident that left him with a severe brain hemorrhage and internal injuries.The prince was flown back to Saudi Arabia and admitted to King Abdulaziz Medical City in Riyadh, where he remained under constant medical care. Despite efforts by American and Spanish specialists, including extensive consultations with neurologists and intensive care experts, he never regained full consciousness. Over the years, Prince Al-Waleed remained in a minimally responsive coma, occasionally showing involuntary movements that offered small but fleeting signs of awareness.Throughout his condition, he was kept on a ventilator, and his vital functions were supported round-the-clock. His case drew interest and sympathy far beyond the royal court, turning his hospital room into a quiet spiritual site. Family members and visitors,including religious figures,would gather to recite Quranic verses, hoping for a miracle. Videos showing Prince Al-Waleed’s seemingly subtle reactions to Quranic recitations were shared online and often went viral, becoming symbolic of enduring hope and divine possibility.For nearly 20 years, Prince Al-Waleed's father, Prince Khaled bin Talal, remained resolute in his belief that his son would recover. His dedication was widely recognized, especially as he continually refused to end life support measures despite the long odds and medical counsel. During nightly prayers in Ramadan or during family visits on Eid, Prince Khaled would be seen praying with deep emotion, calling on Allah for his son's healing.Over the years, he used his social media presence,particularly on the platform X,to share updates, express prayers, and ask others to join in his faith and support. His words conveyed not only the pain of a father but also the strength of belief that defined their journey through the years. Even shortly before his son’s death, Prince Khaled had shared heartfelt prayers for his recovery.On Saturday, July 19, he confirmed the passing of his son with a message that reflected both his grief and his faith. He wrote on X:The announcement was echoed by the Royal Court and published through official channels, closing a chapter that many across the country had followed for nearly two decades.Following the announcement, the Royal Court provided details of the funeral prayers and mourning services. Funeral prayers for Prince Al-Waleed will be held on Sunday, July 20, after the Asr prayer at Imam Turki bin Abdullah Mosque in Riyadh.Separate condolence gatherings have been arranged for men and women,The funeral service will be held over three days, spanning three days from Sunday to Tuesday.These gatherings are expected to bring together members of the royal family, friends, dignitaries, and the many people across Saudi Arabia who had followed the story of the Sleeping Prince with empathy and prayer.A Saudi royal called the “Sleeping Prince” who stayed in a coma for nearly 20 years after a crash.A severe brain injury from a 2005 car accident left him in a coma at age 15.He remained in a coma for almost 20 years, from 2005 until his passing in 2025.No, Prince Al-Waleed stayed minimally conscious and never fully woke up.Funeral prayers will start July 20 at Imam Turki Mosque in Riyadh, with services lasting three days.","At age 15, Prince Al-Waleed suffered a severe brain injury in a 2005 car crash that caused his coma.

Trump’s Body Raising Red Flags? FIFA World Cup Photos Reveal POTUS’ ‘DISTURBING’ Condition





The White House Thursday announced that President Donald Trump has been diagnosed with a chronic but benign vein condition amid ongoing speculations over his bruised hand . The White House said the president sought a medical examination for swollen legs which came up with the new finding.""I know that many in the media have been speculating about bruising on the president's hand and also swelling in the president's legs. In the effort of transparency, the president wanted me to share a note from his physician ... all results were within normal limits,"" White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said.""Recent photos of the president have shown minor bruising on the back of his hand. This is consistent with minor soft tissue irritation from frequent hand-shaking and the use of aspirin,"" Leavitt said. Leavitt said Trump decided to share the note on his new health diagnosis with everyone. The president underwent a thorough evaluation after noticing swelling in his lower leg. The condition is benign and common among individuals over the age of 70. Leavitt announced that there is no evidence of deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease.Explaining the bruises on Trump's back of hand, Karoline explained that this is because of minor soft tissue irritation due to frequent hand shaking and the use of aspirin which Trump takes as part of standard cardiovascular prevention regimen.The clarification from the White House came as a close-up of Trump's hand became the center of online chatter as his hand looked evidently bruised. The theory of handshaking was floated earlier too but it was dismissed by many experts.Dr Neal H Patel, a doctor at Providence St Joseph Hospital, told the Daily Mail earlier this year that shaking hands is unlikely to have caused the damage. “I see a lot of patients who are businessmen, and I’ve never really seen them getting bruising from too much handshaking,” he said. “I guess it’s possible, but that would really not be on my list of ideas of what causes it.”",The White House said the president sought a medical examination for swollen legs which came up with the new finding.

He reportedly crashed the craft into a hotel swimming pool, reports the New York Post.A woman was also injured in the incident after being hit by Baumgartner as he fell to the ground. She was transported to Murri Hospital, though initial reports indicate her injuries are not serious.Baumgartner departed from Fermo, but while flying along the coast, he lost control of the powered hang glider for reasons still under investigation. Following the crash, he lost consciousness and went into cardiac arrest, reports the Daily Mail.Emergency responders called for an air ambulance to transport him to the Torrette Hospital, in Ancona but he was pronounced dead at the scene.Around two hours before the deadly crash he posted a story on his Instagram that read “too much wind.”“Our community is deeply affected by the tragic disappearance of Felix Baumgartner, a figure of global prominence, a symbol of courage and passion for extreme flight,"" said the city's mayor Massimiliano Ciarpella, through a social media post.Baumgartner’s daring jump in 2012 from a capsule over 39 kilometres (24 miles) above Earth cemented his place in the record books as an extreme adventurer. Baumgartner achieved the fastest freefall on record, reaching a top speed of 1,357.6 kilometers (843.6 miles) per hour after jumping from the capsule, reports AFP.He set a world record in 1999 for the highest parachute jump from a building by leaping off the 1,483-foot-tall Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.He also became the first person to skydive across the English Channel in 2003.""I always had the desire to be in the air,"" Austrian media quoted him saying. ""I climbed trees, I wanted to see the world from above.""","Austrian sportsman Felix Baumgartner, 56, also known as “fearless Felix” has lost his life in a paragliding accident in Italy, as per local media.

Clashes In US Senate; 'Are You Afraid Of Trump?': Lawmakers Walk Out Of 'Kangaroo Court' Hearing





• Donald Trump’s name appears seven times in Jeffrey Epstein’s flight logs from the 1990s.• The flights involved his then-wife Marla Maples, their daughter Tiffany, and staff.• There is no evidence Trump flew to Epstein’s private island or was involved in criminal activity.• Trump and Epstein were socially close in the ‘90s but reportedly fell out in the early 2000s.It’s a question that has lingered in the public consciousness ever since Jeffrey Epstein’s sordid crimes exploded into global headlines: Did Donald Trump ever fly on Epstein’s infamous “Lolita Express”?Thanks to a tranche of declassified documents released earlier this year by U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi—including the full flight logs from Epstein’s private jet—the answer is now clear. Yes, Trump was listed on at least seven flights aboard Epstein’s plane. But the logs also complicate some of the more salacious speculation that has dogged him for years.The logs tell a story—but not the whole oneAccording to flight manifests released in February 2025, Trump is recorded as a passenger on several domestic flights aboard Epstein’s plane in the early 1990s. Notably, these flights include family members: his then-wife Marla Maples, their young daughter Tiffany, and a nanny.There are no flights logged to Epstein’s notorious private island in the Virgin Islands (Little Saint James), nor are there entries connecting Trump to Epstein’s international sex trafficking operations.Still, these entries confirm what was long speculated: Trump and Epstein were socially close in the New York elite circles of the ‘90s, often appearing at the same parties and clubs. In a now-infamous 2002 quote to New York Magazine, Trump said: “I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. He’s a lot of fun to be with... even said he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.”By the mid-2000s, however, Trump reportedly severed ties with Epstein. Multiple reports, including investigative timelines from Time and The New York Times, note a falling out—reportedly over a Florida real estate dispute. Trump has since claimed he banned Epstein from Mar-a-Lago, though the circumstances remain murky.During the 2016 and 2020 election cycles, Trump was repeatedly asked about Epstein. His campaign consistently maintained that he had no knowledge of Epstein’s crimes and was “one of the few” who had distanced himself from the financier early on. In 2019, after Epstein’s arrest, Trump told reporters, “I had a falling out with him a long time ago. I wasn’t a fan.”The declassified flight logs from 2025 have reignited public scrutiny, particularly on social media. But Trump’s 2024 re-election campaign—and now his second-term White House—have aggressively pushed back on suggestions of impropriety. His spokesperson Steven Cheung dismissed the log entries as “routine travel decades ago” and said Trump “never visited Epstein’s island, never engaged in any criminal behaviour, and never flew with Epstein after discovering what he was. ”However, critics say the presence of his name on the logs—even if innocent—adds to a pattern of proximity between Trump and men later convicted or accused of sex crimes, including Bill Cosby, R. Kelly, and Ghislaine Maxwell.To date, no criminal charges or credible allegations have tied Trump to Epstein’s sex trafficking operation. The released flight logs suggest a limited social association, concentrated in the early 1990s and mostly involving domestic flights with family. There is no indication of underage passengers accompanying Trump, no evidence of him visiting Little Saint James, and no direct link to the sexual abuse cases for which Epstein was convicted.Still, in a political environment dominated by conspiracy theories and mounting distrust in institutions, the optics are potent. Trump’s second term has already been marred by public anger over the abrupt firing of Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor who worked on Epstein-linked cases, and speculation that the Trump administration is trying to control the narrative around Epstein’s death and files.Much like his presidency, Donald Trump’s connection to Jeffrey Epstein is a story with loud headlines and fine print. The records confirm they moved in the same elite circles. But as of now, the flight logs suggest association, not implication.A: Seven times, mostly in the early 1990s, including flights with Marla Maples and Tiffany Trump.A: No. There is no record of Trump flying to Little Saint James.A: Yes, they were socially close in the 1990s but reportedly fell out by the mid-2000s.A: No. He has not been charged or formally implicated in Epstein’s sex trafficking network.A: In 2025, Attorney General Pam Bondi released full Epstein flight logs as part of a broader declassification push, reigniting media interest.","Donald Trump was listed on at least seven flights aboard Jeffrey Epstein's plane.

"'Fired without reason’: Who is Maurene Comey, Manhattan prosecutor who worked on Epstein files and Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fired-without-reason-who-is-maurene-comey-manhattan-prosecutor-who-worked-on-epstein-files-and-sean-diddy-combs/articleshow/122663581.cms,"Maurene Comey (AP)

Who is Maurene Comey?





The US justice department has fired Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor in Manhattan and the daughter of the former FBI director James Comey, on Wednesday. The reason for her firing was not immediately clear.Comey had worked on several high-profile cases, including the prosecution of financier Jeffrey Epstein as well as rapper Sean “Diddy” Combs.Reacting to the firing, Maurene Comey said there was no reason behind her dismissal. “Yesterday was unexpectedly my last day in the Office. I was summarily fired via memo from Main Justice that did not give a reason for my termination,” she wrote in an email to colleagues, reported the New York Post.This comes as the administration is embroiled in a controversy after closing the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein.Maurene Comey was a seasoned attorney in the Southern District of New York, widely regarded as one of the Justice Department's most prestigious prosecutorial offices.She famously worked on the prosecution of financier Jeffrey Epstein, who died in custody in 2019, as he was awaiting trial.Comey achieved significant success in several high-profile prosecutions, most notably securing the conviction of Ghislaine Maxwell on sex trafficking charges for assisting financier Jeffrey Epstein in the abuse of underage girls.In a declaration submitted in January, Comey argued that releasing documents on the Epstein case could harm the government’s position on a potential retrial of Maxwell. She said that making the materials public might expose witnesses “to possible embarrassment and harassment” potentially discouraging them from testifying, as per the New York Times.Most recently, Comey led the prosecution of Sean “Diddy” Combs. The trial against Combs ended in a split verdict and he was convicted on prostitution related charges but acquitted of more serious charges.In recent months, Comey came under repeated attacks from Trump’s right-wing base, including Laura Loomer, a far-right political activist, who urged attorney general Pam Bondi to fire her in May.","Maurene Comey, the daughter of former FBI director James Comey, was fired on Wednesday.

New video shows Travis Decker 3 days before he allegedly killed his daughters





Newly acquired video footage from the Wenatchee police department shows Travis Decker, 32, the fugitive father, accused of killing his three young daughters, just days before their disappearance.The footage captures Decker speaking with a police officer and another individual on May 27. Decker rear-ended another vehicle at a red light, and the second person in the video was the driver of that car, reported CBS News.In the nearly 20-minute-long video, Decker and the other person were seen speaking to each other and the officer. Towards the end of the video, Decker and the other driver shook hands before returning to their respective vehicles. The audio could not be intercepted from the clip.The driver whose car Decker had hit said that he was “nervous and fidgety” and kept on asking him to “not call the police,” as per KING 5. “I could tell he was not in his full senses,” the driver added.Travis Decker has been the subject of an intense manhunt since June 2 after officials found the bodies of three of his daughters, Paityn (9), Evelyn (8), and Olivia (5), at a campground near Leavenworth, Washington State.The girls were on a “planned visitation” with Decker on May 30. Decker’s vehicle was found abandoned near the girls’ bodies and officials announced that the bloody handprints on the truck’s tailgate matched the DNA profile of Decker's.As per court records, Decker’s ex-wife raised concerns over his mental health, highlighting that he became increasingly unstable and was often living out of his truck. She also mentioned that he had been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder but was not under any medication.Decker served in the US Army from 2013 to 2021, including a deployment to Afghanistan in 2014, and received training in navigation, survival, and wilderness skills. Police stated that he is currently wanted on three counts of first-degree murder and three counts of kidnapping.A probable cause affidavit revealed that Decker fled the scene of a different crash on May 4, although the other driver declined police follow-up since their vehicle was undamaged.","New video shows Travis Decker 3 days before he allegedly killed his daughters.

Torrential rainfall on Saturday caused flash flooding across Washington DC and parts of neighbouring Maryland and Virginia, prompting multiple emergency rescue operations, officials confirmed.Some areas, including densely populated suburbs like Silver Spring, recorded more than 5 inches of rain. Several major roads in Montgomery, Prince George’s, and Anne Arundel counties in Maryland, as well as in Fairfax County, Virginia, became impassable by Saturday evening. In northwest DC, floodwaters submerged parked vehicles.Pete Piringer, spokesperson for Montgomery County Fire and Rescue Service, said crews responded to numerous calls and rescued dozens of people, including several trapped inside vehicles surrounded by rising water. “No injuries were reported,” he added.Flood sensors showed that Sligo Creek, which flows through Montgomery and Prince George’s counties and parts of the capital, rose by 10 feet in just 30 minutes.In Great Falls, Virginia, about 17 miles from DC, seven people were rescued from a vehicle caught in swift-moving water, according to Fairfax County Fire and Rescue. The New York Times reported no injuries in that incident either.By 9 pm, most of the severe weather had passed, although isolated showers remained possible. Flood warnings were still in effect late Saturday for parts of southern Montgomery County, northern Fairfax County, and sections of Washington DC.","Some areas, including densely populated suburbs like Silver Spring, recorded more than 5 inches of rain.

Trump Buried His Name in the Epstein Files? Shocking Claim by US Senator | WATCH





President Donald Trump expressed his frustration with 'troublemakers' who are asking for the release of more files in connection with Jeffrey Epstein and said nothing will be good enough for them and they will keep asking for more.""I have asked the Justice Department to release all Grand Jury testimony with respect to Jeffrey Epstein, subject only to Court Approval. With that being said, and even if the Court gave its full and unwavering approval, nothing will be good enough for the troublemakers and radical left lunatics making the request. It will always be more, more, more. MAGA!"" Trump wrote.The administration is embroiled over the Epstein issue as it is facing resistance inside and outside. While MAGA commentators are pushing for the release of more files, Trump has sued The Wall Street Journal and Rupert Murdoch over a report claiming that Trump wrote a birthday message to Epstein in 2003 in which he doodled a naked woman. “Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret,"" the message said as WSJ reported.Trump denied ever writing the letter and vowed to drag Murdoch into court to testify.Trump's statement came a day after the DOJ requested the unsealing of grand jury transcripts related to Epstein. Bondi's top deputy, Todd Blanche, submitted the motion to unseal the Epstein transcripts, as well as those in the case against convicted British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, just one day after Trump publicly directed the department to take that step.Trump was the president when Epstein, the convicted sex offender, committed suicide in 2019 in his prison cell. Once, Trump was close to Epstein as several photos revealed but Trump claimed that he had a fallout with Epstein over a real estate issue.Recently, Elon Musk triggered a major controversy when he said Donald Trump was named in the Epstein files. Within days, the DOJ and the FBI closed the Epstein case and said the disgraced financier did not have any client list and there was no foul play in his death.","'Troublemakers' are asking for the release of more files in connection with Jeffrey Epstein.

Trump claims five jets were shot down in India-Pakistan skirmish,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-claims-five-jets-were-shot-down-in-india-pakistan-skirmish/articleshow/122784581.cms,"TOI correspondent from Washington





: US President Donald Trump on Friday claimed that up to five fighter jets were shot down during the recent India-Pakistan conflict, triggering a social media dogfight between partisans over which country came up trumps in the brief war.At a White House dinner with Republican lawmakers, Trump, who is under political siege domestically over the Epstein tapes, resorted to his oft-repeated claims about being a global peacemaker, citing his role in defusing the India-Pakistan clash.""We stopped a lot of wars. And these were serious. India and Pakistan, that was going on. Planes were being shot out of there. I think four-five jets, maybe were shot down, actually, Trump said, without identifying which country lost the jets or the basis for his claims.""... they were (going) back and forth, and it was getting bigger and bigger, and we got it solved through trade. We said.. We're not making a trade deal if you're going to be throwing around weapons, and maybe nuclear weapons,"" Trump asserted in claims that have been refuted by New Delhi.Trump also gave a nuclear dimension to the conflict although most analysts say the spat came nowhere near breaching a nuclear threshold.While Pakistanis gloated under the assumption that Trump meant five Indian jets were shot down, India partisans maintained that the US President did not specify which country the fighter planes belonged to and Pakistan too had lost jets in the skirmish.However, top Indian military officials have acknowledged lately that they lost an unspecified number of jets in the initial skirmish, suggesting that they were operating below a certain political threshold before being given a free hand. This resulted in a broader response that put several Pakistani bases and airfields out of commission before the US stepped in to save it.In a recent report, the Economist, citing unnamed foreign military officials, claimed five Indian aircraft were destroyed, including at least one Rafale. The report also said Indian military officials are starting to indicate that the losses may have stemmed from Indian errors rather than technological deficiencies.""Early reports suggested that the decisive factor was the superiority of Pakistan’s Chinese-made j-10 fighters and its pl-15 air-to-air missiles. India does appear to have underestimated those. And China may have also tipped the balance by providing Pakistan with early warning and real-time targeting data,"" the report said.But given India’s success later on in the fight, the journal added, the bigger problem might have been how India used its own fighters on the first night of the brief war. It cited an Indian defense attache in Jakarta who told a seminar earlier this month that India lost some aircraft only because its political leadership had ordered its air force not to hit Pakistan’s air defences. Instead, they targeted only militant sites on the first day.“After the loss, we changed our tactics and we went for their military installations,” the attache, Captain Shiv Kumar, was quoted as saying. Most analysts now say that after adopting an initial posture of only hitting terrorist compounds in response to the Pahalgam attack, New Delhi turned it around by lifting the constraints on its military after the setback in the air.","US President Donald Trump on Friday claimed that up to five fighter jets were shot down during the recent India-Pakistan conflict.
