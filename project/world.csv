NEW DELHI: Goa Police have detained Ajay Gupta, a co-owner of the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub, after a devastating fire at the Arpora establishment killed 25 people. Gupta, who was held in Delhi on Tuesday, insisted he had no role in the day-to-day running of the club. “I am just a partner. I don’t know anything,” he said soon after being picked up, following a Lookout Circular issued against him.The arrest comes as investigators widen their search for the club’s primary owners, brothers Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, who fled to Phuket hours after the blaze. Interpol has issued a Blue Corner Notice to help trace them, and officers say this was processed unusually quickly. Goa Police are coordinating with the CBI and Interpol, and Chief Minister Pramod Sawant has said a team will be sent to Thailand to bring the accused back.Also read: Goa authorities trashed own report on violations by club The Bureau of Immigration earlier informed police that the Luthras boarded IndiGo flight 6E 1073 from Delhi to Phuket on Sunday morning. A notice seeking an explanation for why their passports should not be impounded has been issued by the regional passport office. A Blue Corner Notice has also been issued against the property owner, British national Surinder Kumar Khosla.Gupta is expected to be flown to Goa on Wednesday and placed under arrest once formalities are complete.Five others connected with the nightclub — chief general manager Rajiv Modak, general manager Vivek Singh, bar manager Rajiv Singhania, gate manager Riyanshu Thakur and employee Bharat Kohli — have already been arrested.Goa Tourism Minister Rohan Khaunte called the fire “a very tragic episode”, saying accountability must be fixed and that an inquiry should deliver a factual report. On Tuesday, the district administration also demolished part of the Romeo Lane restaurant in Vagator, owned by the Luthras, citing illegal construction.","Goa Police detain Ajay Gupta, a co-owner of the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub, after a devastating fire at the Arpora establishment killed 25 people.

NEW DELHI: The ruling BJP on Wednesday labelled Congress MP Rahul Gandhi 'Videsh Nayak' and 'leader of paryatan' ahead of his upcoming visit to Germany from December 15 to 20.BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla — a former Congress member — also highlighted that the trip will coincide with the ongoing Winter Session of Parliament, which began on December 1 and is scheduled to conclude on December 19.“Once again, Videsh Nayak is doing what he does best — going on a foreign tour! Parliament is on till 19th Dec, but Rahul Gandhi will visit Germany from Dec 15–20! Rahul is LoP — leader of paryatan. During the Bihar elections too he was abroad and then on a Jungle Safari, ” Poonawalla wrote on X.While 'Videsh Nayak' (leader of foreign visits) plays on 'Jannayak' (leader of the masses), a title the Congress uses for Gandhi, 'leader of paryatan' (tourism) is a jab at his LoP initials — leader of opposition, a post he has held since June last year - and also references what the BJP says are his frequent foreign trips The Indian Overseas Congress (IOC) announced on Monday that Gandhi will visit Germany. On December 17, the former Congress president will meet German lawmakers and members of the Indian community in Berlin, the European nation’s capital and largest city.During his overseas visits — first as an MP and now in his official capacity as leader of the opposition — the Raebareli MP has repeatedly raised concerns about what he describes as the ‘weakening’ of India’s democracy and the ‘capture’ of its institutions by the BJP and its ideological mentor, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).In September, the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), which provides him security, flagged repeated ‘lapses’ by Gandhi in following security protocols — including intentionally skipping mandatory protective measures on multiple occasions despite being a Z+ protectee with an Advance Security Liaison (ASL) team.","The Indian Overseas Congress (IOC) announced on Monday that Gandhi will visit Germany.

NEW DELHI: A portion of the Romeo Lane restaurant located at the Vagator area in Arpora was demolished on Tuesday.The property is owned by Luthra borthers (Gaurav Luthra and Saurabh Luthra) who are in the soup after a fire at their Goa nighclub killed 25 people.""We will demolish the encroachment on the beach side. The total area to be demolished is 198 square meters..."", Dhiraj Wagale, deputy director, Goa Tourism told news agency ANI.Earlier in the day, the first image of Gaurav Luthra emerged after he was spotted at Thailand's Phuket airport. Interpol has issued blue corner notice against nightclub owners Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, Goa Chief Minister's Office said in a statement.The Interpol Blue Notice is issued to collect additional information about a person's identity, location or activities in relation to a criminal investigation. The Red Notice which calls for detention of the fugitive can only be issued after a charge sheet is filed and a Non Bailable Warrant is issued against the wanted person.Chief minister Pramod Sawant had instructed the district administration to complete all formalities and carry out the demolition on Tuesday.Officials said the shack, known as 'Romeo Lane', was illegally built on government land.The shack is the third property owned by brothers Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, who fled to Thailand hours after the blaze at their 'Birch by Romeo Lane' nightclub in Arpora, which occurred around midnight on Saturday.","Officials said the shack, known as 'Romeo Lane', was illegally built on government land.

"Supreme Court allows SC certificate for girl based on caste of mom, not non-SC dad",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-allows-sc-certificate-for-girl-based-on-caste-of-mom-not-non-sc-dad/articleshow/125853399.cms,"SC had earlier held father's caste as decisive factor

NEW DELHI: In a rare decision aimed at facilitating the education of a minor girl, Supreme Court on Monday approved issuance of an SC certificate based on the 'Adi Dravida' caste of her mother, who is married to a non-SC person, even though it is yet to adjudicate a bunch of petitions challenging the norm that a child inherits their father's caste.A bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi refused to entertain a challenge to a Madras HC order directing grant of SC caste certificate to the Puducherry girl on the sole ground that her academic career may suffer without it.""We are keeping the question of law open,"" the bench said. However, what the CJI said next could lead to a big debate. He said, ""With changing times, why should a caste certificate be not issued based on the mother's caste?"" This would mean that children born of the marriage of an SC woman with an upper caste man and brought up in upper-caste family environs would also be entitled to an SC certificate.The mother had requested the tahsildar to grant SC certificates to her three children - two daughters and a son - based on her caste certificate as her husband had stayed at her parents' house since their marriage. In her application, she had contended that her parents and grandparents belonged to Hindu Adi Dravida community.The presidential notifications of Mar 5, 1964, and Feb 17, 2002, read with instructions of the Union ministry of home affairs, say that a person's eligibility to get a caste certificate is primarily based on their father's caste as well as his residential status in the state or UT's jurisdiction.In Punit Rai Vs Dinesh Chaudhary [(2003) 8 SCC 204], a case relating to reservation, SC had said that the decisive factor for determination of caste of a person will be the caste of the father as per customary Hindu Law and that in the absence of statutory law, they would inherit their caste from the father and not the mother.In the 2012 judgment in 'Rameshbhai Dabhai Naika vs Gujarat', a two-judge bench of SC ruled, ""The determination of caste of a person born of an inter-caste marriage or a marriage between a tribal and a non-tribal cannot be determined in complete disregard of attending facts of the case."" It said, ""In an inter-caste marriage or a marriage between a tribal and a non-tribal, there may be a presumption the child has the caste of the father. This presumption may be stronger in the case where in the inter-caste marriage or a marriage between tribal and non-tribal, the husband belongs to a forward caste.""""But by no means is the presumption conclusive or irrebuttable, and it is open to the child of such marriage to lead evidence to show he/she was brought up by the mother who belonged to SC/ST. By virtue of being the son of a forward caste father, he did not have any advantageous start in life but on the contrary suffered the deprivations, indignities, humiliations and handicaps like any other member of the community to which his/her mother belonged. Additionally, he was always treated as a member of the community to which her mother belonged not only by that community but by people outside the community as well,"" it said.","CJI Surya Kant said, ""With changing times, why should a caste certificate be not issued based on the mother's caste?"" This would mean that children born of the marriage of an SC woman with an upper caste man and brought up in upper-caste family environs would also be entitled to an SC certificate.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125853517,imgsize-1051879,width-400,resizemode-4/sc-had-earlier-held-fathers-caste-as-decisive-factor.jpg"

He is proudly carrying forward Indira's dictatorial baton.""BJP released a list of allegations, claiming the ""poster that rattled the Congress"" highlighted deep-rooted corruption and misgovernance in Telangana.According to the party, real estate across the state has been captured by the chief minister’s family, while weekly cash collections are being routed to the Congress high command in Delhi.It further alleged demolition of Hindu temples, a secret pact to shield KCR from prosecution, and a breakdown of law and order with goons and rowdies dominating public spaces.The BJP also accused the government of demanding a 25% commission on every file, contract and project. ""Instead of defending itself democratically and offering accountability, Congress arrested the Social Media Convener of BJP Telangana,"" they added.Earlier in Hyderabad, the Telangana BJP held a ‘Maha Dharna’, accusing the Congress government of ""betraying"" voters by not implementing the promises made before the state elections.Those who participated included Telangana BJP president N Ramchander Rao, Union minister G Kishan Reddy, MP D K Aruna, Rajya Sabha MP K Laxman, MLAs, MLCs and other senior leaders.

""Before the election, the Congress party convinced the public with six guarantees and promises. But not a single guarantee or promise has been implemented.

'Leader Is Bulldozing': Kharge, Nadda Lock Horns Over TMC MP's Speech In Rajya Sabha

NEW DELHI: As the Rajya Sabha met on Tuesday for a special discussion marking 150 years of Vande Mataram, the session quickly turned combative. Congress president and Leader of Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge used the occasion to criticise BJP ’s ideological predecessors, accusing them of “working for the Britishers,” while Congress leaders were fighting for independence.Kharge said the Congress had played a central role in turning Vande Mataram into a rallying call against British rule. “Your (BJP) history is that you were always against the freedom struggle and patriotic songs. When Mahatma Gandhi started the non-cooperation movement in 1921, lakhs of freedom fighters from the Congress went to jail chanting 'Vande Mataram'. What were you doing? You were working for the Britishers,” he said.He also alleged that PM Modi “leaves no chance to insult Jawaharlal Nehru,” adding, “Home Minister Amit Shah follows the same,"" as quoted by ANI.Earlier in the House, Shah rejected Opposition claims that the discussion was politically timed ahead of the West Bengal assembly elections. He said critics needed to “think afresh” about the legacy and significance of the national song.“Some people believe that because there are elections in Bengal, this discussion is being held. They want to link the glorification of Vande Mataram with the West Bengal elections. I think they need to reconsider their understanding,” he said. Describing the song as an “immortal creation that awakens devotion and duty toward Mother India,” he urged members to view the debate beyond electoral politics.Vande Mataram, first composed independently and later included in Bankim Chandra Chatterjee’s 1882 novel Anandamath, completed 150 years on November 7, 2025.","Congress president and Leader of Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge used the occasion to criticise BJP ’s ideological predecessors.

After Delhi Blast, Jaishankar Tells SCO Nations India Has Right To Defend Its People Against Terror

NEW DELHI: National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Tuesday arrested Dr Bilal Naseer Malla of Baramulla, Jammu and Kashmir, for allegedly destroying evidence linked to last month’s car blast near the Red Fort.His arrest in Delhi marks the eighth made in the case as investigators continue to widen their probe into the deadly attack.According to the NIA, Bilal also played a role in the larger conspiracy behind the November 10 explosion, which killed 15 people and injured several others in the busy Red Fort area. “As per NIA investigations, Bilal had knowingly harboured the deceased accused Umar Un Nabi by providing him logistical support. He is also accused of destruction of evidence related to the terrorist attack,” the agency said in a statement.The blast is being treated as a terrorist strike under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, with investigators linking it to a Jaish-e-Mohammed module involving radicalised young doctors and cross-border handlers.Several others connected to the accused have already been arrested, including a Faridabad resident who allegedly sheltered Umar Un Nabi shortly before the incident.The NIA said it is continuing to work closely with central and state agencies to trace every part of the conspiracy and identify all those involved in planning and executing the attack.","Dr Bilal Naseer Malla of Baramulla, Jammu and Kashmir, arrested for allegedly destroying evidence linked to last month’s car blast near the Red Fort.

There are experts & NGOs in court who have said that IndiGo actually runs DGCA. Are you aware of this situation?When the investigation is there, we are going to look into DGCA as well.Criminal liability, whatever is there within the act and rules, everything will be taken, keeping into account the distress that has been faced by the passengers.What will you say to those people who had to pay Rs 92,000 for a Delhi-Bengaluru flight because there was surge pricing?

Threats to BLOs during SIR unacceptable: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/threats-to-blos-during-sir-unacceptable-supreme-court/articleshow/125877162.cms,"The Supreme Court has mandated all states to provide robust security for booth-level officers during voter enumeration, warning of severe action against any threats or obstructions. The court emphasized that non-cooperation with the Election Commission's work is a serious matter, extending beyond West Bengal to all states, and stressed the need for BLOs' safety to prevent anarchy.

'BLOs Are Dying, Shut Down SIR': Manish Tewari’s Charge Triggers Showdown Over Election Reforms

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday asked all states to provide adequate security to booth-level officers engaged in special intensive revision, and warned that it would seriously view any instance of BLOs being threatened or impediments being placed in their work.The observations were made by a bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi after senior advocate V Giri, appearing for NGO Sanatani Sangsad, demanded security for BLOs, alleging that they were being intimidated and threatened during voter enumeration work in West Bengal.EC, through senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, said the commission had written a strong letter to WB govt on security of BLOs and assured the court that it had adequate powers under the Constitution to handle the situation. Dwivedi said such situations were arising because EC had no control over state police. The petitioner sought deployment of paramilitary forces in WB for safety and security of BLOs.Giving a pan-India dimension to the issue raised in the petition, the bench said, ""If EC had any grievance about non-cooperation from state officials or police regarding safety and security of BLOs, it should approach the SC. We will pass appropriate orders.It is not only about West Bengal but for all states. Non-cooperation with EC work is a serious issue. BLOs must get full security.""While seeking a response from the Centre and EC, the bench asked the poll panel to assess the situation in all states and move SC for appropriate directives, if needed. ""We will take strong action to protect BLOs. Their safety and security must be ensured, otherwise there will be anarchy,"" the CJI-led bench said and referred to its Dec-4 order directing states to allow BLOs who are stressed or face health issues to withdraw from SIR work and provide adequate replacements.When Dwivedi and senior advocate Maninder Singh said problems were arising in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and West Bengal because their state govts had made public their opposition to SIR, the bench said BLOs unwilling to carry out SIR work would have to file an application before the district electoral officer, who would inform the state.During the proceedings, Justice Bagchi questioned the material submitted by Sanatani Sangsad to allege intimidation of BLOs in West Bengal. ""Apart from a solitary FIR, there is no other credible evidence to substantiate the allegations. Based on a solitary incident, can it be said that it is done only in West Bengal and not in other states? Is it not a narrative from one side? Should police in all states be put under EC?"" he asked.EC said there had been certain incidents in West Bengal that saw electoral officers being gheraoed and threatened by the public. ""A lot of narratives are being floated by political parties. At present, a BLO is to do enumeration of a maximum of 1,200 voters in 37 days, which is roughly 35 per day. Is it too much work?"" the poll panel said.Justice Bagchi said, ""This is not a desk job where the quota of 35 is met easily. A BLO must go from house to house, verify enumeration forms and then upload it. There could be stress and physical strain. We want to ensure that SIR at ground level is done without a hitch.""EC said the narrative of BLOs being under stress was being spread by political parties. The CJI said that was why the court had directed states on Dec 4 to augment the workforce.","The Supreme Court has mandated all states to provide robust security for booth- level officers during voter enumeration.

JAMMU: Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh high court (HC) Tuesday took suo motu cognisance of a shocking lapse at Government Super Speciality Hospital (GSSH), Jammu, wherein cardiac care services reportedly remained paralysed for two days after registered vendors allegedly stopped supplying emergency cardiac devices over unpaid dues, amounting to nearly Rs 30 crore, under Ayushman Bharat scheme.HC was informed about the situation while it was hearing four PILs seeking directions for adequate medical facilities and infrastructure in capital cities and urban areas, besides regulation and monitoring of private nursing homes and medical institutes as per govt guidelines.A bench of Chief Justice Arun Palli and Justice Rajnesh Oswal noted that, as per newspaper reports placed before it, the supply of stents, pacemakers, balloons and cath lab consumables to GSSH remained suspended — on Monday and Tuesday — over the pending payments, bringing the hospital’s cath lab operations to a grinding halt.While GSSH usually performs around 25 cardiac procedures daily, not a single heart-related intervention could be carried out during this period, placing vulnerable cardiac patients at serious risk, the bench noted.HC posted the next hearing for December 29.Late Tuesday, the official spokesperson of GMC Jammu — with which GSSH is affiliated — said the health department had “directed GMC Jammu to arrange supplies from alternative vendors and other institutions, including AIIMS Vijaypur, GMC Srinagar, SKIMS and PGIMER Chandigarh and consequently, cardiac services were restored forthwith”.","Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh high court (HC) Tuesday took suo motu cognisance of a shocking lapse at Government Super Speciality Hospital (GSSH), Jammu. cardiac care services reportedly remained paralysed for two days after vendors allegedly stopped supplying emergency cardiac devices over unpaid dues.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125876430,imgsize-772681,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-17.jpg"

Interpol Blue Notice Explained: How CBI Tracks Absconding Luthra Brothers In Goa Nightclub Fire Case

NEW DELHI/PANAJI: Interpol has issued a blue corner notice against Saurabh and Gaurav , co-owners of ‘Birch by Romeo Lane' nightclub in Goa, following last week's blaze that claimed 25 lives. The owners are believed to be hiding in Phuket, Thailand.On Tuesday, Goa Police detained Ajay Gupta, a partner of the Luthra brothers, in Delhi.The regional passport office, New Delhi, has also issued a notice to the Luthra brothers seeking an explanation as to why action should not be initiated to impound their passports within seven days.A blue corner notice is typically issued to gather additional information about a person's identity, whereabouts or activities in connection with a criminal investigation. Goa Police said the notice would help trace the accused and also prevent them from migrating to any other country from their present destination.A senior Goa police officer said while a blue corner notice typically takes about a week to process, in this case, it was issued within two days of the incident with the support of central agencies.India and Thailand signed a formal extradition treaty in 2013, which came into force on June 29, 2015.Goa CM Pramod Sawant told TOI a team will be sent to Thailand to bring back the accused.On Sunday, a Goa Police team had reached Delhi with an arrest warrant for the Luthra brothers and searched their residential and office premises, but they were not found. ""Since they were unavailable, a notice under the appropriate sections of law was pasted at their residence. By the evening of Dec 7, a lookout circular was issued against both by Bureau of Immigration (BoI) at the request of Goa Police,"" a Goa Police officer said.BoI later informed investigators the brothers boarded IndiGo flight 6E 1073 to Phuket at 5.30am Sunday, just hours after the blaze.Deputy inspector general of police, Goa Police, Varsha Sharma, said a lookout notice has also been issued against the owner of the property, UK national Surinder Kumar Khosla.Goa Police, Sharma said, are coordinating with CBI and Interpol to bring back the Luthras. Cops are also probing their financial aspect, along with central agencies.","Interpol has issued a blue corner notice against Saurabh and Gaurav, co-owners of ‘Birch by Romeo Lane' nightclub in Goa.

The district administration has set up a special investigation team to probe the murder.MV-26, home to 188 families, didn’t have a single resident who stayed back as security personnel patrolled the surroundings on Tuesday.The settlers, mostly Bengali-speaking Hindus who migrated from Bangladesh decades ago and got Indian citizenship, fled after being outnumbered by the mob that stormed their village on Monday and torched more than 160 houses. Tribals allege that Lake Padiami (51), the woman whose murder triggered the backlash, was killed and decapitated by some residents of Malkangiri Village-26.“I still can’t believe this happened,” said an elderly man. “We came here from Bangladesh nearly 50 years ago and rebuilt our lives from scratch. The last thing we need is to live in fear.”Most residents spent the night scattered across neighbouring villages, seeking shelter in homes of relatives and well-wishers.A handful returned briefly Tuesday morning to survey the damage, warily walking through the razed settlement before leaving.Gouranga Karmakar, president of the Bengali Settlers’ Association in Malkangiri, described the violence as a painful reminder for a community that had long struggled to find stability.“This is the worst situation we could be in,” Karmakar said. “Some of our elders lived through trying times in Bangladesh before migrating. Many are saying this feels worse as this is the land we thought would be our home.”Karmakar said the community condemned the tribal woman’s murder and wanted the strictest punishment for whoever was responsible for the crime. “But destroying an entire village is not justice; it is a tragedy. Everything turned to ashes in a few hours.”The district administration held a “peace meeting” on Tuesday with representatives of both sides in the presence of the district collector and senior police officers. “Both sides agreed to cooperate with the administration in restoring order,” DIG Kanwar Vishal Singh said.Singh said Odisha Disaster Rapid Action Force team was searching for the decapitated victim’s head, as demanded by tribal community. “Underwater cams are being used in the search,” he added.","A tribal mob from neighbouring Rakhalguda ran riot in this pocket of Bangladeshorigin settlers over an Adivasi woman’s beheading.

Miami Mayoral Elections: Eileen Higgins becomes city’s first-ever female mayor - who is she?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/miami-elections-eileen-higgins-becomes-citys-first-ever-female-mayor-who-is-she/articleshow/125881328.cms,"AP file photo

Who is Eileen Higgins ?



Miami voters have elected Democrat Eileen Higgins as the city’s first female mayor and the first Democrat to hold the office in nearly three decades.In Tuesday’s runoff, Higgins, a former county commissioner, defeated Republican Emilio González, a former city manager backed by former President Donald Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.“Together, we turned the page on years of chaos and corruption and opened the door to a new era for our city, one defined by ethical, accountable leadership that delivers real results for the people,"" Higgins said in a statement after the voivtory, promising to lead a government “that finally earns the public’s trust,” as cited by NYT.Although Miami’s elections are officially nonpartisan, both major parties played an active role in the campaign. US President Donald Trump endorsed González, while the Democratic National Committee backed Higgins. In the days leading up to the vote, several prominent national Democrats traveled to Miami to campaign alongside her, an unusual show of support for a low-turnout, off-year local election.Higgins secured victory the victory after topping the first round of voting on November 4, where she received 35 per cent of the vote compared to González’s 19 per cent.Higgins will make history as Miami’s first female mayor and its first non-Hispanic mayor since the 1990s, breaking a three-decade dominance of Cuban American Republicans in city politics.Higgins, a trained mechanical engineer and former Peace Corps director in Belize, previously represented what she described as a Republican-leaning district on the county commission.She also holds a Master of Business Administration from Cornell University’s Johnson Graduate School of Management.On the campaign trail, she pledged to focus on addressing residents’ everyday concerns if elected, as cited by Politico.Higgins had served as a well-known county commissioner for eight years, representing a district that included Miami’s downtown. In the November 4 election, she also secured the top spot across all five of the city’s commission districts.She received a social media endorsement from former transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg, who is a former mayor and was a 2020 presidential candidate.She also led in all five of the city’s commission districts and will succeed outgoing Mayor Francis Suarez, who had briefly sought the Republican presidential nomination, as cited by the NYT.Miami, home to roughly half a million residents, is Florida’s second-largest city after Jacksonville. While the city, like the state, has trended Republican in recent election cycles, Higgins’ Democratic victory stands out as particularly notable.","Eileen Higgins, a former county commissioner, defeated Republican Emilio González in Tuesday’s runoff.

Dileep’s acquittal shocks industry as six co-accused convicted in high-profile Kerala actor assault case

A costly affair

On Dec 2, a nursing student takes a cab to SMVT railway station to board train to Ernakulam

She calls her boyfriend in Ernakulam to inform she's catching a 5.30am train

Cab reaches the station. The student and driver walk around the station and spend the night in the car

On Dec 6, student files gang-rape complaint against the driver and his friends

Driver, a father of two, gets arrested. He maintains he's innocent

Police check CCTV footage and do not find driver's friends and realise it was a consensual encounter

BENGALURU: A 22-year-old nursing student's claim of being gang-raped by a cab driver and his accomplices near Sir M Visvesvaraya Terminal has been revealed as false. Police found CCTV footage and WhatsApp chats indicating a consensual encounter. The woman, who filed the complaint on Dec 6, allegedly fabricated the story to avoid her boyfriend's questions about the scratch marks on her neck.The investigation is ongoing, and the driver, who has pleaded his innocence, remains in police custody.On the night of Dec 6, the nursing student from a private college and originally from Kerala, reported to Madiwala police station that she had been gang-raped by a cab driver and several of his friends inside the vehicle near Sir M Visvesvaraya Terminal on the night of Dec 2.In response, police quickly registered a gang-rape case and transferred it to Banaswadi police station due to jurisdictional issues. Before this transfer, senior police officers were informed of the incident, and based on the student's statement, the driver was arrested at his residence in east Bengaluru.The cab driver, a 33-year-old father of two with a homemaker wife, was in shock upon hearing the allegations against him.Throughout the process, he maintained his innocence.Meanwhile, police reviewed CCTV footage from the incident location and were surprised to see the nursing student and the cab driver together at the railway station between 11.30pm on Dec 2 and 5.30am on Dec 3.

Eventually, the woman boarded the Ernakulam train after 5.30am.Authorities also checked the cab driver's WhatsApp messages and discovered that the nursing student had sent him numerous messages from Dec 3. Some of these messages suggested a consensual interaction and indicated a good relationship between them even after the encounter. Police then summoned the woman for questioning.When pressed, she admitted to have made the false claim to avoid her boyfriend's questions about the scratch marks on her neck, which had occurred during her time in the vehicle with the cab driver. According to the cab driver, he was familiar with the student because they both were from Kerala, and he had dropped her off at the railway station that night. After getting into the cab, the nursing student had even called her boyfriend in Ernakulam to inform him that she would be catching the early-morning train.WhatsApp messages on driver's phone show student texting him from Dec 3, indicating good relationship between the twoThe complainant gets summoned.

PANAJI: Days after a devastating fire killed 25 people at Birch by Romeo Lane late Saturday night, govt on Tuesday demolished an allegedly illegal structure constructed on around 200sqm at Vagator’s Romeo Lane, a restaurant-cum-nightclub also owned by brothers Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra.This is the third time in the past six months that the illegal structure of Romeo Lane at Vagator has been demolished partially.The state tourism department had earlier demolished the same structure partially, following a 2024 direction of the Bombay high court.After having expanded Romeo Lane nightclub across the country, the Luthra brothers started Birch by Romeo Lane to cater to places where the original couldn’t open due to territorial restrictions.Deputy director of tourism Dhiraj Vagle, who was at the spot, said that the first time they demolished the structure was in July, but it was thereafter reconstructed.Vagle said that the department received a complaint from the tourism department warden that the structure resurfaced, and they demolished it again in Aug. But the structure came up yet again in Oct.Chief minister Pramod Sawant toldthat the remaining structures in CRZ areas would also be demolished.On Sunday, govt had sealed the premises of Romeo Lane, Vagator, as it didn’t implement fire safety measures.Tourism minister Rohan Khaunte said that the department has a clear mandate in areas that fall within its jurisdiction. “Enforcement actions such as this are part of our ongoing drives against illegal structures, unauthorised activities, touts, and other practices that damage Goa's tourism credibility,” said Khaunte.He further added that “these are ongoing routine governance measures aimed at ensuring that tourism operates in an orderly, lawful, and responsible manner”.Tourism director Kedar Naik stated that the department’s action was taken in full compliance with the legal framework. “Despite prior enforcement, the structure was rebuilt without authorisation,” he said.The tourism department warned that any encroachment or unauthorised activity, particularly on public land and in environmentally sensitive spaces, will attract action as per law.The demolition started at around 5.10pm, with one bulldozer and heavy police force deployment.","This is the third time in the past six months that the illegal structure of Romeo Lane at Vagator has been demolished partially.

The motive was as old as time, but the method was chillingly modern.The Delhi crime branch recently cracked a multi-city cyber threat case where the targets were the commissioners of police in Delhi and Bengaluru, and the engine driving the chaos was nothing more than jealousy over a woman.The suspect, Abhay Shee, a 22-year-old BCA student and freelance web developer from south Delhi's Saidulajab, allegedly crafted an elaborate plot to ruin his romantic rival, Mohit. Police said he spoofed email IDs, claimed association with banned organisations and sent terror-themed extortion demands to the highest levels of law enforcement — all while demanding money be deposited into Mohit's account and filing false cyber complaints of rape and murder in Mohit's name.The incident was reported on Dec 7, when the Delhi top cop received an email demanding extortion money and invoking a ""terror outfit"", an email that was also suspiciously CC'd to another account. Treating the threat seriously, Special CP Devesh Srivastava formed a team to probe the case.The investigation quickly led them to the mobile number listed in the threat, which belonged to a 23-year-old man named Mohit in Gurgaon.When cops knocked on Mohit's door, they found not a hardened cyber-criminal, but a bewildered victim who claimed he was drowning in a sea of international spam calls, unsolicited payment QR codes and threatening emails sent from accounts maliciously spoofed to look exactly like his own.Mohit revealed that the extensive online harassment campaign included the exact same terror-related email sent to the Bengaluru police commissioner on Nov 30, and even the creation of several fake cyber complaints of rape and murder filed in his name, all seemingly designed to derail his life.Quickly realising Mohit was being framed, the crime branch looked into the last piece of the puzzle: a past interaction with a girl that led to a confrontation with her ""boyfriend"", Abhay.Police then arrested Abhay and booked him under relevant sections. During questioning, he confessed to orchestrating the entire plot, creating fake IDs, using VPNs to hide his tracks and sending the threat emails to two top cops. Police also recovered the personal mobile phone used for the elaborate scheme.","The Delhi crime branch recently cracked a multi-city cyber threat case.

Vastrapur police registered an FIR of abetment to suicide against the husband and his parents.The complaint was filed with Vastrapur police by the woman's brother, Hiralal Gautam, 26, who lives with his family in Bhammariya na Chapra on Sola Road. He told police that his younger sister Reena, the deceased in this case, married Rajesh Parmar of Pagara village in Rajasthan on May 16, 2023.According to the FIR, Reena was initially treated well for about six months after the marriage. Later, her husband Rajesh, mother-in-law Manjuben, and father-in-law Baldev Parmar allegedly began taunting her for not conceiving. The complainant said the trio often quarrelled with her over small domestic issues and subjected her to verbal, physical, and mental harassment.Reena would frequently return to her parents' home in Ahmedabad in distress. Hiralal stated that the in-laws even visited their home, argued with the family, and demanded back the jewellery given at the time of marriage. Each time, the family counselled Reena and sent her back in the hope that her marital life would stabilise.As the harassment allegedly continued, Reena and Rajesh shifted to a rented room in Bhammariya na Chapra nearly two years ago. However, the FIR says Rajesh did not give her household expenses and continued quarrelling with her, while his parents taunted her over phone calls.On Sunday, around 5.30pm, Rajesh called Hiralal and informed him that Reena hanged herself in their room. Hiralal rushed to the spot and found her lying dead on the bed. Rajesh told him that the couple argued in the morning after Reena asked for money to buy a sweater. He claimed he left for work around 9.30am and found the door locked from inside when he returned in the evening.Rajesh said he peered through the window and saw Reena hanging from an iron angle, after which he forced open the door, cut the cloth she used, and laid her on the bed.Police sent the body for post-mortem examination at Sola Civil Hospital and handed it over to the family after examination.

Trump ERUPTS On Stage As Peace Prize Surprise Drops After 'Saving Millions Of Lives' | FIFA

Human rights group FairSquare has filed a formal complaint to FIFA's ethics committee, alleging that world football president Gianni Infantino violated the organisation's neutrality rules by endorsing US President Donald Trump. The controversy stems from Infantino awarding Trump FIFA's first-ever Peace Prize during the December 6 draw for the 2026 World Cup, which will be hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico.In its complaint, FairSquare argues that the award itself represents a serious ethical breach. The group says granting a peace prize to a “sitting political figure is in and of itself a clear breach” of Article 15 of FIFA's code of ethics, which prohibits officials from expressing political preferences.FairSquare also targeted the way FIFA is being run. Calling the current leadership system “absurd”, the NGO accused Infantino of undermining the organisation's integrity and acting against the interests of global football.“This complaint is about a lot more than Infantino's support for President Donald Trump's political agenda,” FairSquare programme director Nicholas McGeehan said. “This is about how FIFA's absurd governance structure has allowed Gianni Infantino to openly flout the organisation's rules and act in ways that are both dangerous and directly contrary to the interests of the world's most popular sport.”The NGO has also asked the committee to investigate how the FIFA Peace Prize was created and why Trump was selected. It highlighted Infantino's previous praise for Trump, including his public plea in October that the US President be considered for the Nobel Peace Prize, along with three other political statements favourable to him.","Human rights group FairSquare has filed a formal complaint to FIFA's ethics committee.

'TOO BUSY TO PICK HER CALLS': Trump Mocks Marjorie, Defends Foreign Trips Bringing 'Trillions To US





President Donald Trump veered into a heated attack on immigrants during a Pennsylvania speech on Wednesday lashing out at “third world” nations.Speaking to supporters at the Mount Airy Casino Resort in Mount Pocono, the US president veered sharply from a speaking on inflation to again question why the United States does not receive more immigrants from Scandinavian nations.“Why is it we only take people from s—-hole countries, right?” he told the audience. “Why can’t we have some people from Norway, Sweden? Just a few.” At another point he added: “Do you mind sending us a few people? Send us some nice people… But we always take people from Somalia. Places that are a disaster, right? Filthy, dirty, disgusting, ridden with crime.”Trump repeated that he had imposed “a permanent pause on third world migration, including from hellholes like Afghanistan, Haiti, Somalia and many other countries”. He claimed he once asked senators: “Why is it we only take people from shithole countries, right?” before insisting, “I didn’t say shit. All you did, remember?”He went on to mock Somalia directly, saying: “The only thing they’re good at is going after ships. But they don’t go after our ships… that same missile that knocks the crap out of them… we have the greatest.”The rally — held in a competitive House district that could influence next year’s midterms — was officially a White House event but carried the tone of his campaign appearances. Trump displayed charts comparing inflation under Joe Biden and under his own tenure, asserting: “I have no higher priority than making America affordable again… They caused the high prices and we’re bringing them down.”Yet many in Monroe County, which flipped to Trump last year, remain unconvinced that prices will fall. Local residents spoke of rising grocery and electricity bills, and even loyal voters questioned whether Trump could reverse the trend.Despite that, the president vowed to increase his travel ahead of the midterms, with his chief of staff Susie Wiles saying he would be “on the ballot” to boost turnout among his supporters.Trump also returned to his sweeping immigration restrictions, boasting of halting entry from countries such as Afghanistan and Haiti, and revisiting long-standing grievances about refugees and asylum seekers.While he rated the economy “A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus”, national polling continues to show weak public confidence. But Trump’s message on Tuesday suggested he is increasingly leaning on familiar themes: immigration, grievance — and an insistence that only he can fix the country’s problems.","'Why is it we only take people from s—-hole countries, right?’ he told the audience. ‘Why can’t we have some people from Norway, Sweden?

An illegal immigrant, who is identified as Oscar Gerardo Solorzano-Garcia, was taken into custody in connection with a stabbing on a light rail in Charlotte, North Carolina.While investigating the case, the police discovered that the 33-year-old suspect was actually deported twice back to his country.Solorzano-Garcia was issued a final deportation order in 2018 and was removed from the United States on March 9 of that year, DHS said. He was arrested crossing the border illegally again in 2021 and removed a second time. DHS said he apparently re-entered the US a third time at an unknown date and location.DHS Secretary Kristi Noem condemned the alleged stabbing, saying the incident “should have never happened.“This heinous stabbing by this twice removed illegal alien should have NEVER happened. ICE lodged an arrest detainer to ensure Oscar Gerardo Solorzano-Garcia is not released back into North Carolina neighborhoods. Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee the county will honor the detainer since they have a history of not cooperating with ICE,” said Secretary Noem in a press statement released by DHS.“Under President Trump, ICE is being unleashed to ensure public safety for all Americans. Make no mistake: We will not rest until every depraved criminal illegal alien is removed from our communities,"" she added.What are the charges against him?Oscar Gerardo Solorzano-Garcia has been charged with first-degree murder after allegedly attacking a male passenger with a large knife, according to DHS. ICE said Solorzano-Garcia is in the country illegally.Authorities said Solorzano-Garcia has a criminal history that includes prior arrests for aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, destroying evidence, resisting arrest and using a false ID, as well as convictions for robbery and illegal reentry.","Oscar Gerardo Solorzano-Garcia, 33, has been charged with first-degree murder after allegedly attacking a male passenger with a large knife.

Biggest ever US travel ban in the works?

The United States is planning to expand the number of countries that were covered by its travel ban - and the new list may include over 30 countries.US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, on Thursday, during an interview on Fox News’ The Ingraham Angle, when asked whether President Donald Trump’s administration would increase the number to 32, she said “I won’t be specific on the number, but it’s over 30, and the president is continuing to evaluate countries. ""In June, Trump signed a proclamation banning citizens of 12 countries from entering the United States and restricting those from seven others, saying it was needed to protect against “foreign terrorists” and other security threats, Reuters reported.The bans applied to both immigrants and non-immigrants, such as tourists, students and business travellers.Noem did not specify which countries would be added to the list. “If they don’t have a stable government there, if they don’t have a country that can sustain itself and tell us who those individuals are and help us vet them, why should we allow people from that country to come here to the United States?” she said.Reuters previously reported that the Trump administration was considering banning citizens of 36 additional countries from entering the United States, according to an internal State Department cable.An expansion of the list would mark a further escalation of migration measures the administration had taken since the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, DC, last week.Investigators said the shooting was carried out by an Afghan national who entered the US in 2021 through a resettlement programme under which Trump administration officials have argued there was insufficient vetting. Days after the shooting, Trump vowed to “permanently pause” migration from all “Third World Countries,” although he did not identify any by name or define “third-world countries.”Prior to that, officials from the Department of Homeland Security said Trump had ordered a widespread review of asylum cases approved under the administration of his predecessor, Democratic President Joe Biden, and Green Cards issued to citizens of 19 countries. Since returning to office in January, Trump has aggressively prioritised immigration enforcement, sending federal agents to major US cities and turning away asylum seekers at the US-Mexico border. His administration has frequently highlighted the deportation push, but until now it has put less emphasis on efforts to reshape legal immigration.","US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the president is 'continuing to evaluate countries' In June, President Donald Trump signed a proclamation banning citizens of 12 countries from entering the United States.

Survivors were in 'clear distress'

Survivors were trying to 'stay in the fight'

Trump says Pete 'didn't know what people were talking about'





Two people who survived the September 2nd US strike on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean were seen waving before they were killed in a second follow-up strike, sources familiar with a video shown to lawmakers revealed.One source said the gestures could be interpreted as the survivors either calling for help or surrendering to avoid another strike.The operation was the first of more than 20 US attacks on suspected drug-carrying vessels under the Trump administration. The GOP leader has defended the campaign as a necessary way to curb narcotics trafficking. However, the premise remains legally questionable. The Pentagon has reported that more than 80 people have died in these strikes, including 11 in the initial September 2 attack.Members of Congress were shown video of the strikes, including the follow-up attack that killed the two survivors, during a closed-door briefing with the operation's commander, Adm. Mitch Bradley, and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine, according to CBS News.Democratic Representative Jim Himes of Connecticut described the scene as one of the most difficult things hes ever seen in his life. He said the survivors appeared “in clear distress without any means of locomotion.”Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas defended the strikes. He said the survivors were “trying to flip a boat loaded with drugs bound for the United States back over so they could stay in the fight” and clarified that the strikes were “entirely lawful and needful.”US President Donald Trump hinted he would support releasing the video to the public, but denied knowledge of any order given to target survivors. “I don't know that that happened. And Pete said he did not want that — he didn't even know what people were talking about. We'll look into it. But no, I wouldn't have wanted that. Not a second strike,” he said.Trump has also said that Venezuela’s airspace should now be considered “closed” amid rising tensions.Defensed department officials have defended the operations as legal and necessary. Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell told The Washington Post that “ongoing operations to dismantle narcoterrorism and to protect the Homeland from deadly drugs have been a resounding success.”Defense secretary Pete Hegseth said the strikes were “lethal, kinetic strikes” aimed at stopping drug trafficking and destroying vessels affiliated with “Designated Terrorist Organisations.”Legal experts and lawmakers have expressed concern that targeting survivors could constitute a war crime.","Survivors seen waving before they were killed in a second follow-up strike.

MAGA chief Donald Trump doubled down on his attack on Democratic Representative Ilhan Omar, alleging she entered the United States by marrying her brother and saying she should be sent back to Somalia.In an interview with Politico, Trump said, “I wanna see people that contribute. I don’t wanna see Somalia. I don’t wanna see a woman that marries her brother to get in and then becomes a Congressman and does nothing but complain…Let her go back, fix her own country.”He described Somalia as “one of the worst countries in the world” and called recent events in Minnesota “horrible.”The row follows a week of Trump targeting Omar and wanting to deport her. Speaking to reporters on Air Force One, he said, “Somalia, where you have a Congressman goes around telling everybody about our Constitution, yet she supposedly came into our country by marrying her brother. Well, if that’s true, she shouldn’t be a Congressman, and we should throw her the hell out of our country.”Trump has also announced the end of Temporary Protected Status for Somalis in Minnesota, accusing the Democratic-controlled state of massive fraud.Omar and other Democrats have defended the Somali community, while rumours of her deportation have circulated online.Omar reportedly came to the United States in 1995 and became a naturalised citizen. Some reports allege she entered as a member of the ‘Omar’ family, which was not her biological family. It is claimed that she later married her genetic brother, Ahmed Nur Said Elmi, in 2009, divorcing in 2017. Omar has dismissed these allegations as false.As a naturalised US citizen, Omar cannot be deported unless the government proves in court that she deliberately lied or hid essential facts during her naturalisation process. She has not responded to the speculation much and says it would not be a major concern as she could live anywhere in the world.Similarly, ex-DOGE lead Elon Musk also targeted Ilhan of ""importing"" Somalis to enhance her voter base in Minnesota.

Was the Cinnabon worker harassed first?





An ex-Cinnabon employee in Wisconsin who was filmed hurling the N-word at a Somali Muslim couple has attempted to defend herself by insisting she cannot be racist because she once had a “coloured” son.Crystal Wilsey went viral this week for harassing a Somali couple before being fired by the franchise. However, she has raised over $120,000 in fundraiser money through the help of social media.Crystal Wilsey defended herself in a TikTok video posted after she was dismissed.“P.S., to the racism, if you look at my Facebook from 2010, you’ll see on there that I have a blended family, and my son was colored,” she said.However, netizens were not happy with this explanation since this does not give any person, especially of white race, to hurl N-word at a black person.Moreover, Wilsey also said the boy’s darker skin was not due to ethnicity but to a medical condition, according to EURweb. She told viewers her son had Addison’s disease, adding: “Addison’s disease, and he was discriminated called chocolate because he had brown skin – explanation of racism.” This explanation also didn't undo the damage of the original slur.The confrontation that led to her firing took place at a Cinnabon outlet in Wisconsin and was recorded by the woman involved.The video shows Wilsey mocking the woman’s hijab, using the N-word repeatedly and raising both middle fingers: “I am racist, and I’ll say it to the whole entire world.""The couple said they had simply asked for more caramel on their cinnamon roll. Cinnabon later described the footage as “deeply troubling” and confirmed that Wilsey had been dismissed by the owner.Wilsey’s has had a troubling personal history as well. Court records show a long list of offences spanning more than twenty years, including drug charges, domestic abuse cases and child-endangerment allegations across several states.Supporters claim Crystal was “harassed” and unfairly sacked. Some social media users claimed the Somali couple had mocked the employee first for not wearing a hijab, which in turn provoked her.Her donation page states: “No White person should lose their job for refusing to be harassed by Somalians.”Wilsey has insisted her comments were meant as sarcasm, comparing her language to “edgy comedy” and saying her diverse friendship circle proves she is not prejudiced. The woman who filmed the encounter dismissed that explanation. “Sarcasm? You smiled while saying it and flipped us off. That’s not a joke – that’s hate,” she wrote online.Furthermore, US President Donald Trump recently called Somali communities ""garbage."" This hostility only worsened the situation as federal authorities prepare an immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota targeting Somali nationals who are living unlawfully in the country.","Crystal Wilsey was filmed hurling the N-word at a Somali Muslim couple.

'Compromise With Russia Or...': U.S. Gives 2 Options To Zelensky; Trump For Ceding Land To Putin





LONDON: US President Donald Trump said in an interview published Tuesday that Europe was weak and its nations were ""decaying,"" days after the Trump administration issued a strategy paper that indicated that the US should no longer guarantee the continent's security.The president's comments, made in a wide-ranging interview with Politico, widened a dispute between Trump and his European counterparts over Europe's future and how to end Russia's war in Ukraine.Trump said that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine, who has rejected parts of a US proposal for a ceasefire, would have to ""get on the ball"" and start ""accepting things."" Zelenskyy's army is losing the war, Trump said, suggesting that it was time for him to compromise in the ceasefire talks.Trump's interview was published a day after the leaders of Britain, France and Germany met with Zelenskyy in London to show their support for Ukraine and discuss alternative ceasefire plans. Zelenskyy reiterated after that meeting that Ukraine would not budge from its long-standing opposition to handing over land to Russia, a requirement of Trump's proposed peace plan. Trump also accused Zelenskyy of not having read a new draft of the US peace plan.""It would be nice if he would read it,"" Trump said. ""You know, a lot of people are dying. So it would be really good if he'd read it.""Several elements of the US peace plan - which was published last month, prompting alarm across Europe - echoed demands made by the Kremlin.Trump suggested that a Russian victory would be inevitable, in part because the country is much larger than Ukraine. Russia, he said, has the ""upper hand. And they always did. They're much bigger. They're much stronger,"" Trump said. Even though he said he gave Ukraine a lot of credit for bravery, ""At some point, size will win.""Trump also called for elections in Ukraine, accusing the country's leadership of ""using war not to hold an election.""

Elon Musk once again weighed in on US immigration policy, accusing Democratic leaders, including Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, of using migrant communities from overseas to build their vote banks.The billionaire made the remarks on X after responding to a user who complained that Western governments were prioritising “millions of unvetted third-world immigrants.”The user wrote: “It is deeply weird that the absolute top priority for a lot of American and European politicians is bringing in millions of unvetted third-world immigrants. They could have shut down right wing populism entirely by compromising on this issue, but they refuse.”Musk attacked Ilhan Omar in the reply, accusing her of catering to Somalis in Minnesota to build her voter base: “Once you understand the incentive, the reason for the behavior becomes obvious: they are importing a left-voting bloc that depends on government handouts.” He went on to claim that “a prominent example of this in America is Ilhan Omar and her Somali voting bloc in Minnesota, an area which used to be primarily Nordic-German.Musk said that bringing in new voters is a path to a ""single-party supermajority” and claimed the same thing had happened at the state level in Blue democratic strongholds like California and New York. Musk concluded: “We stand on the precipice of disaster, an end to America.”The Tesla CEO's comments come as he has shared far-right talking points about Somali immigrants, white population decline and Democratic motives.

'Your H-1B has been prudentially revoked': What does this email from the US consulate mean?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/your-h-1b-has-been-prudentially-revoked-what-does-this-email-from-the-us-consulate-mean/articleshow/125875990.cms,"What is prudentially revoked? What should people receiving these notices do?

Can a prudential visa revocation be contested?





Amid a major immigration shake-up by the US administration, many H-1B visa holders alleged that they received emails from the consulate informing them that their H-1B visa had been prudentially revoked. The revocation notice says it's effective immediately unless the individual is present in the US, in which case the revocation will become effective immediately upon their departure from the US.US immigration attorney Emily Neumann said such visa revocation notices are being sent to people who had a past interaction with law enforcement even with no conviction. ""Many of these incidents were already disclosed and cleared in earlier visa stamps. A revocation does not affect lawful stay in the United States, but it means the issue will be reexamined at the next visa appointment. Hard to see how this is an efficient use of government resources when the incident was already previously vetted,"" Neumann said.Many Redditors shared screenshots of such notices they received, asking whether their status in the US becomes illegal now and whether they are now vulnerable to ICE arrest.A prudential visa revocation is not permanent; it is a temporary and precautionary cancellation done out of prudence or caution. If a person is present in the US when the visa is prudentially revoked, they remain in the US until the normal expiration of the visa. The visa revocation does not nullify one's permission to stay in the US as the visa revocation means the visa stamp in the passport is canceled but not the status. In such cases, they don't have to leave the US but if they leave, they can't come back even if their visa is not expired, as the stamp is now invalid.There is no appeal usually against visa revocation and the individuals have to reapply for their visa. There is no ban on reapplying but there will be scrutiny on why the visa was previously revoked. For individuals with DUI cases, they will have to make sure that they have proof that the case was disposed.","Many H-1B visa holders alleged that they received emails from the consulate informing them that their visa had been prudentially revoked.

“We’ll Strike Again If Needed”: Navy Chief Issues Stern Warning To Pakistan





Pakistan’s military spokesperson Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry has come under widespread criticism after he appeared to wink at a journalist following her question about imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan In the video, the reporter questions Chaudhry about the allegations against Khan, referring to him as a “national security threat” and “anti-state.”""How is it different from the past, or should we expect any development in the future?"" the journalist added.To this, the Chaudhary replied, ""and add a fourth point that you are missing: he is also a 'zehni mareez' (mental patient)."" Chaudhary then proceeded to smile and wink at the journalist.The video, now circulating widely on social media, has sparked widespread criticism, with users calling the gesture “shameless.”""This is how corrupt Pakistani military officers treats women... shameless!!"" a user on X said.Last week, Chaudhry criticised the imprisoned former prime minister, calling him “a mentally ill person,” “a narcissist,” and “a security risk,” while noting that it was for the government to determine how to deal with him, as cited by Dawn.During an hour-long media briefing, Chaudhry acknowledged that the military had never before taken such a clear public stance on a political leader, calling the move “unprecedented.”Chaudhry’s strongly worded press briefing came in response to Khan’s latest remarks against the military leadership, conveyed earlier this week through his sister, Uzma Khan, during a jail visit after weeks of limited access. The comments were later shared on Khan’s X account. Uzma told reporters that her brother was in good health but “very angry.”Imran Khan is currently lodged in Adiala Jail, where he was first sentenced to three years in prison in August 2023 in the Al-Qadir Trust case. Subsequent corruption convictions have extended his total jail term to 14 years, the longest imposed on him to date.Meanwhile, Pakistani government officials have dismissed rumours of Khan’s death in custody or a secret transfer from Adiala Jail, maintaining that he remains in the Rawalpindi facility and is in stable condition.","Pakistan’s military spokesperson Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry has come under widespread criticism.

Pak President Zardari Approves Asim Munir As The First Chief Of Defence Forces Amid Power Tensions





Pakistan’s defence ministry on Friday officially notified the appointment of Field Marshal Asim Munir as the country’s first Chief of Defence Forces (CDF).The ""president, on the advice of the prime minister, is pleased to appoint Field Marshal Asim Munir (NI) M as the chief of army staff, concurrently the chief of defence forces for a tenure of five years,” the notification read, news agency PTI reported citing Dawn.This comes a day after President Asif Ali Zardari approved his appointment on the advice of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.According to the notification issued under Article 243 of Pakistan’s Constitution and the amended Pakistan Army Act, Munir will serve concurrently as Chief of Army Staff and Chief of Defence Forces for a tenure of five years. The notification marks the most significant restructuring of Pakistan’s military command since the 1970s.The appointment follows the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment last month, which created the new CDF post to establish a unified command structure and enable faster decision-making in critical situations.The amendment also abolished the office of the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), which had coordinated the tri-services since 1976. The CJCSC post formally ended on November 27 following the retirement of General Sahir Shamshad Mirza.With the restructuring, operational, administrative and strategic authority of the armed forces has been consolidated into a single office headed by the CDF. The revised Article 243 provides that the president, acting on the prime minister’s advice, will appoint the army chief, who will concurrently serve as the CDF.Munir was first appointed Army Chief in November 2022 for three years. His tenure was extended to five years in 2024 after amendments to the Pakistan Army Act.He was promoted to the rank of Field Marshal days after the four-day conflict with India in May, becoming only the second officer in Pakistan’s history to hold the rank after Field Marshal Ayub Khan.Alongside Munir’s notification, the defence ministry also confirmed a two-year extension for Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu. His extended tenure as Chief of the Air Staff will begin in March 2026 and continue till March 2028.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif congratulated Munir on his “historic” appointment, saying his leadership had been pivotal in guiding Pakistan’s armed forces. He also praised the air chief for his command during recent operations. defence minister Khawaja Asif and other senior leaders also extended their congratulations, according to Dawn.Information minister Attaullah Tarar said Pakistan’s defence had strengthened with the establishment of a unified command. Dismissing speculation over the delay in the notification, he said rumours circulating on social and electronic media had proven baseless.Earlier uncertainty had followed the abolition of the CJCSC post and the end of Munir’s original three-year term in late November, leading to political speculation over upcoming four-star appointments. Government officials maintained that the delay was procedural and linked to the prime minister’s travel schedule.Explaining the significance of the new post, army spokesman Lt General Ahmad Sharif Chaudhry said the CDF headquarters would improve coordination across modern, multi-domain warfare involving land, sea, air, cyber, space and intelligence operations. He added that many countries already operate under similar unified command structures.Under the amended military laws, the five-year tenure of the first COAS-plus-CDF is deemed to begin from the date of notification, effectively resetting Munir’s term. The law also allows future reappointments or extensions of up to five years, creating the legal framework for continuity in leadership.The next major step under the new structure will be the appointment of the Commander of the National Strategic Command (NSC), a four-star position responsible for strategic assets. The NSC commander will be appointed by the prime minister on the recommendation of the CDF.Meanwhile, law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said the defence ministry is finalising a new organogram for the CDF to clearly define command flows between the CDF, the service chiefs and the newly created strategic command.Politically, the 27th Constitutional Amendment has drawn mixed reactions. While the ruling coalition hailed it as a step towards efficiency and national security, opposition leaders warned that it concentrates excessive power in the military and could weaken democratic and provincial autonomy.",Pak President Zardari Approves Asim Munir As The First Chief Of Defence Forces.
