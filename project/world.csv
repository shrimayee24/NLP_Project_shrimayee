Two schools in Delhi received bomb threats via e-mail |RK Puram | Paschim Vihar | Delhi Police

NEW DELHI: Over 40 private schools in Delhi received bomb threats via email on Sunday night at 11.38 pm. Among these, five schools that received these threats are Delhi Public School in Vasant Kunj and in R.K. Puram, G.D. Goenka School and Doon Public School in Paschim Vihar, and Brilliant's Convent School in Pitampura.An official said calls of bomb threats were received from DPS RK Puram at 7.06 am and GD Goenka Paschim Vihar at 6.15 am.A team from the Delhi Fire Services (DFS) immediately reached the spot. The police, bomb disposal squad, and dog squad, along with DFS personnel, are checking the entire premises of the school.As of now, nothing suspicious has been found, a police official said.The schools were targeted in a threatening email, which claimed that hidden bombs were planted within the premises. The email asserted that multiple bombs were strategically placed inside the building, posing a significant threat to the students and staff.The anonymous sender demanded a ransom of $30,000, warning that failure to comply would result in the detonation of the bombs. The school administration took immediate action, sending students back home who came to attend classes. Parents were asked to pick up their children as a precautionary measure.""I planted multiple bombs inside the building. The bombs are small and hidden very well. It will not cause very much damage to the building, but many people will be injured when the bombs detonate. You all deserve to suffer and lose limbs. If I do not receive $30,000 I will detonate the bombs,"" the email read.Most schools that received the threat suspended their classes and sent students back home as officials said. Further checking was underway.Earlier on November 19, the Delhi high court directed the local government and police to create a thorough action plan, including a detailed Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for handling bomb threats and similar emergencies. The authorities were given eight weeks to complete these instructions.The Court specified that the SOP should clearly outline the duties of all involved parties--law enforcement, school management, and municipal authorities--to ensure seamless coordination and implementation.Justice Sanjeev Narula's bench, responding to an application by Advocate Arpit Bhargava, instructed the Delhi Government and Police to complete a comprehensive action plan, including an SOP for managing bomb threats and related emergencies.The action plan must be developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders, including school representatives, law enforcement agencies, municipal authorities, and other state departments.Meanwhile, Delhi chief minister Atishi attacked the Central government and said that the BJP-ruled central government has failed in its only task of providing security.""After the daily incidents of ransom, murders, firing in Delhi, now threats of bombing of schools are being received. The law and order situation in Delhi has never been so bad before. The BJP-ruled central government has failed in its only task of providing security to the people of Delhi,"" Atishi posted on X.Former Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal slammed Union Home Minister Amit Shah and said that the people of Delhi have never seen such a bad state of law and order.""The people of Delhi have never seen such a bad state of law and order in Delhi before. Amit Shah ji should come and answer the people of Delhi,"" Arvind Kejriwal posted on X.","Over 40 private schools in Delhi received bomb threats via email on Sunday night at 11.38 pm.

As per their preliminary probe the toy-like balloon did not carry any device or equipment typically associated with espionage. However, it is not being taken lightly given the history of narcotics smuggling across the border.

MANDYA: Demand for non-veg food has stirred the pot at the three-day All-India Kannada Literary Conference in Mandya starting Dec 20. While organisers have announced a veg-only menu, several groups supporting inclusive and liberal causes are seeking non-veg food items, too, at the jamboree.Sources said lit fests over decades have not served non-veg food. Kannada Sahitya Parishat , the apex Kannada body which is organising the event, has lobbed the ball into the administration's court. ""All decisions on food are taken by a 32-member food committee and district administration. Parishat's role is to invite poets and writers for successful conduct of the event,"" said Parishat president Mahesh Joshi.Federation of Progressive Organisations Monday protested outside Mandya DC's office by consuming eggs and raising the slogan: ""Let there be meat with lentils, kebabs with papad, egg bhurji with kosambari, & meat with mudde.""They contended the literary event was a matter of pride for the region, but exclusion of non-vegetarian food was concerning.

PRAYAGRAJ: Justice Shekhar Kumar Yadav , the Allahabad HC judge who publicly backed the proposed Uniform Civil Code (UCC) at a VHP event during the weekend, had previously advocated making ""cow protection a fundamental right of Hindu community"".Justice Yadav was among two judges invited to the provincial convention of VHP's legal cell in Kashi, but the other guest -Justice Dinesh Pathak - did not attend Sunday's event at the HC's library hall.VHP said Monday that its legal cell was ""setting the tone for UCC, Waqf Board (Amendment) Bill, and freeing temples from govt control"" by engaging with legal fraternity in all states.""UCC's purpose is to promote social harmony, gender equality and secularism by eliminating unequal legal systems based on different religions and communities,"" Justice Yadav told the gathering in Allahabad.""The aim is to replace various personal laws that currently govern personal matters within different religious communities, ensuring uniformity of laws not only between communities but within a community.""In Sept 2021, the judge caused a stir when he called for cow to be declared India's national animal. ""When culture and faith are hurt, the country becomes weak,"" he said while hearing a case pertaining to cow slaughter.At the Allahabad event, VHP co-convener Abhishek Atrey stoked another row by invoking J&K in reference to turmoil in Bangladesh. With Justice Yadav looking on, he said, ""Bangladesh appears to be another Kashmir. We have to stay united to protect our identity.""VHP's international president Alok Kumar told TOI that the plan to engage with advocates and judges across all states by March next year was an extension of the work done by the organisation's legal cell to spread awareness about UCC and the need to amend the Waqf Act of 1995 and repeal the Mussalman Wakf Act of 1923. VHP's push for UCC is part of the right-wing pitch for a uniform set of laws governing all citizens, irrespective of religion.","Justice Shekhar Kumar Yadav was among two judges invited to the provincial convention of VHP's legal cell in Kashi.

Punjab cops don’t rule out weapon being smuggled one

CHANDIGARH: Punjab police no longer believe that the unsuccessful attempt by Khalistani sympathiser Narain Singh Chaura to assassinate SAD president and former deputy chief minister Sukhbir Singh Badal on Dec 4 was a lone wolf attack.Instead, they suspect involvement of at least two-three suspects in the attack as they investigate the source of the 9 mm pistol used by the former terrorist. Following interrogation of Chaura (68), police teams are learnt to have raided the house of Dharam Singh at Ekalgadda Khurd Cheeme village under Verowal police station in Tarn Taran district at least twice, but he could not be traced.A senior Punjab police officer said apart from Dharam Singh, the role of another person was being verified and “instead of lone wolf attack, two or three persons could be involved.” The officer, however, added that “the inquiry so far has not suggested any foreign angle as initial investigations have not suggested that Chaura was in touch with someone from abroad recently. But the police are not ruling out anything. He may be in touch with someone using some encrypted mode of communication from some other phone.”Dharam Singh, according to a police official posted in Tarn Taran, was also allegedly involved in a case in which Chaura was arrested in 2013 and a consignment of weapons was recovered by the cops following his interrogation at that time.The senior Punjab police ofﬁcer, who is privy to the ongoing investigations in the Sukhbir Badal assassination bid case, said Chaura told investigators that he had “not revealed one pistol, which he used to fire at Badal, at that time (in 2013).” The officer said Chaura claimed the pistol was “initially concealed in a heap of dry fodder.”Chaura, who was wanted in a case where 2 kg of RDX was recovered from a Maruti Suzuki near the Amritsar railway station in 2010, was arrested in 2013. Following his interrogation in the case, police had recovered arms and ammunition which reportedly included an AK-56 rifle, a pistol, five hand grenades and a number of cartridges. He was bailed out in the case in 2018.The senior Punjab police officer, who is privy to the ongoing investigations in the Sukhbir Badal assassination bid case, said that police were not ruling out the possibility of the weapon having been smuggled from across the border in some other consignment recently as “there have been a number of instances where the recoveries of arms smuggled into India from Pakistan have been made.”Another police official said, ""Police were probing the role of Dharam Singh since he had a past association with Chaura and had harboured him in the explosives recovery case of 2010.”A sitting panchayat member of Ekalgadda Khurd Cheeme village, where police have been conducting raids to apprehend Dharam Singh, told the TOI that Dharam Singh allegedly was involved in “harbouring” Chaura in an “old case” and “had also served some time in jail.”The panchayat member said Dharam Singh was around 75 years old and “lived alone” as “his wife and son had moved to America around six months ago.”Dharam Singh, who originally belonged to Kot Hayata village near Khalchian in Amritsar district, had lived in their village “since 1995-1997” and was “prahuna (son-in-law) of the village, as his wife was a village resident,” he added.The panchayat member said after the recent raids, Dharam Singh’s wife had called him to inquire why the police were conducting raids. “Police teams from Amritsar went to Dharam Singh’s house, which is located in the fields in the village, but we have no information why they are looking for him. His wife is in the US and called me to ask why the police were looking for her husband,” he said.Verowal station house officer (SHO) Gurinder Singh, when contacted, said, “The role of Dharam Singh is being verified (in the case). Another officer had gone to conduct the raid. We have learnt that he lives alone and his family lives elsewhere.”However, Tarn Taran senior superintendent of police (SSP) Abhimanyu Rana did not reveal any details and said, “Investigations are being done by the Amritsar City police. I am not privy to the status of their investigation.”Amritsar police commissioner Gurpreet Singh Bhullar was not available for comment.",Punjab police suspect involvement of at least two-three suspects in Sukhbir Badal attack.

MUMBAI: Two more people died on Tuesday, raising the death toll in the crash of a BEST bus inside a housing colony in Kurla (West) to six.On Monday evening, at approximately 9.30 pm, a BEST bus suddenly accelerated and collided with multiple vehicles, including five to six autorickshaws, several cars, and motorcycles on S G Barve Road in Kurla (W). The bus also struck about ten pedestrians before finally halting within a residential complex.Four were declared dead in Kurla Bhabha Hospital (two of these were brought dead and two died after admission to the hospital), one in Kohinoor Hospital, and one in Habib Hospital.Officials have confirmed 6 fatalities , while 43 are receiving treatment in hospital.The toll could go up due to the gravity of the accident, said the police. The driver, Sanjay More (43), who claimed it was a brake malfunction, has been arrested.Joint commissioner of police Satyanarayan Choudhary himself was present at Kurla police station to interrogate the driver. Police said the driver Sanjay More was taken to JJ Hospital for a medical test.Some locals said the accident’s impact “resembled a terror attack”, causing widespread panic. A large crowd gathered, necessitating Quick Response Team (QRT) and Rapid Action Force (RAF) deployment to control the situation.The cause of the accident is uncertain — whether it was due to mechanical failure or human error — said police sources. Cops have taken custody of the bus now and have called in RTO experts and BEST engineers to examine the vehicle. The vehicle involved was an electric AC wet lease bus operated by a driver appointed by a private contractor.BEST sources said an inquiry is being conducted to ascertain if the accident was due to reckless and negligent driving.There are prima facie reports that it occurred due to brake failure, but this was being verified by a technical expert, a BEST official from the traffic division said.RTO head Ravi Gaikwad said a team of experts has inspected the bus and will cooperate with Mumbai police in ascertaining the cause— whether any technical failure, brake failure or negligence on part of the driver.Witnesses said the BEST bus of route number 332, which operates between Kurla and Andheri railway station, was fully occupied.","Two more people died on Tuesday, raising the death toll in the crash of a BEST bus inside a housing colony in Kurla (West) to six.

According to the Committee for Peace and Development (CPD), the violence in Port-au-Prince was directed by an influential gang leader who believed practitioners of the religion were responsible for his son's illness.The UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres spoke against the ""horrific"" violence, with his spokesperson confirming at least 184 casualties, including 127 elderly individuals.The UN and CPD confirmed that the killings occurred in Cite Soleil, a western coastal area of the capital.The Haiti-based organisation in a statement said that the gang leader ""decided to cruelly punish all elderly people and voodoo practitioners who, in his imagination, would be capable of sending a bad spell on his son.""Speaking to AFP, a local resident verified the attacks and confirmed his 76-year-old father was amongst the victims. ""The bandits set fire to his body. The family cannot even organise a burial for him since we were unable to recover the body,"" he said, expressing concern for other family members' safety.""I also fear for their lives,"" he said. ""I will try to get them out,"" he added.The incident marks another instance of extreme brutality in the capital city, which is largely controlled by powerful gangs in this Caribbean nation long affected by political turmoil and natural calamities.The Committee for Peace and Development (CPD) said that ""The gang's soldiers were responsible for identifying victims in their homes to take them to the chief's stronghold to be executed.""""Reliable sources within the community report that more than a hundred people were massacred, their bodies mutilated and burned in the street,"" they added.In a Radio Magik 9 interview, Fritznel Pierre, a prominent figure in the organisation, stated that the casualty figures were incomplete due to the area's inaccessibility.According to his account, armed individuals targeted elderly residents and voodoo practitioners in Cite Soleil's Wharf Jeremie district between Friday evening and Saturday.""Motorcycle taxi drivers who tried to flee with targeted people were also executed,"" he said.Voodoo, introduced to Haiti by enslaved Africans, remains integral to the nation's cultural identity. Previously prohibited during French colonial rule, it received official recognition as a religion by Haiti's government in 2003.Haiti's longstanding instability intensified in February when armed groups initiated coordinated attacks in the capital, aiming to remove then-prime minister Ariel Henry.Armed groups now dominate 80 per cent of the city. Despite the presence of a Kenyan-led police mission supported by the United States and UN, violent incidents continue to increase.Antonio Guterres urged authorities to conduct a comprehensive investigation into the weekend attacks whilst emphasising the need for increased international assistance to support Haitian police against armed groups.The International Organization for Migration reports that Haiti has over 700,000 internally displaced individuals, with children comprising half the number, plus an additional 5,000 people displaced by the recent weekend violence.According to United Nations data, the recent casualties have increased Haiti's death toll this year to approximately 5,000 people.","More than 180 people were killed in a wave of violence in Port-au-Prince over the weekend.

They said Penny continued the chokehold after some passengers left and Neely stopped moving.Neely's legal team may appeal the verdict or pursue a civil lawsuit.Penny's defense argued Neely died from a genetic condition and drugs in his system. Defense attorney Steven Raiser told jurors Penny ""acted to save"" passengers from a ""violent and desperate"" Neely who ""scared the living daylights out of everybody."" The defense claimed self-defense.Prosecutors said Penny held Neely's neck too hard and too long.

Wednesday to Monday: How the 6-day manhunt unfolded



The killer shot Brian Thompson dead on Wednesday morning when the CEO was entering the hotel to attend an investors' summit. He fled the spot on a bike and then left NYC on a bus. Police tracked the trail of clues that he left including the surveillance footage -- from the hostel where he stayed before the murder, the street where he sprayed bullets on Brian Thompson, from the Starbucks where he stopped by just before the murder to get a cup of coffee, a bottle of water and two energy bars. The casings of the bullet that he fires to kill Brian Thompson had three words engraved on them: Deny, defend, depose -- eerily similar to a 2010 book on insurance woes and the world also refer to the tactic that insurance companies deploy to delay payment. After the initial combing, NYPD sleuths concluded that the killer was not in NYC. A backpack was found in the Central Park area similar to the one the killer was seen carrying n surveillance footage. New York City mayor Eric Adams said the sleuths probably had a name for the killer but was not disclosing it as it would help the person to flee further.

How Jordan Neely's father and other family reacted?



Protest erupts after verdict



What judge said in this?



A 26-year-old man Daniel Penny has been found not guilty of putting an unarmed homeless man Jordan Neely in a fatal chokehold, an incident that sparked nationwide discussions about issues including homelessness, mental health care, public safety, and racial relations.After five days and over 24 hours of deliberation, the jury reached their decision.Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg acknowledged the jury's thorough consideration: ""The jury carefully deliberated for four days. They requested readbacks of testimony and asked for video footage to re-watch, as well as written definitions of the law. Their lengthy deliberation – and the totality of the facts and the evidence – underscored why this case was put in front of a jury of Penny's peers.""The verdict announcement prompted mixed reactions in court. Andre Zachery, Neely's father, expressed anger and was escorted out. Some attendees shouted, while another wept openly, ABC news reported.Outside the courthouse, Zachery expressed his grief and disappointment: ""I just want to say I miss my son. My son didn't have to go through this. I didn't have to go through this either. It hurts. It really, really hurts,"" he stated alongside supporters. ""I had enough of this, the system is rigged.""The family's attorney, Donte Mills, indicated their intention to pursue civil action: ""I promised this family justice – we are still going to do that,"" he stated. ""The district attorney did a good job, but the jury in this case let us down.""Gwen Carr, mother of Eric Garner who died in a similar incident, expressed concern about the recurring nature of such events: ""No one deserves to be choked,"" she stated. ""You know, we're in that courtroom, and people are cheering for the verdict.""Penny displayed a brief smile before resuming a neutral expression. His legal team celebrated quietly at their table.The protest erupted outside the court after the verdict and chanted ""Say his name – Jordan Neely"" and ""No justice, no peace"" as authorities dispersed the gathering.In May 2023, Penny, a 25-year-old ex-Marine, restrained Neely, a 30-year-old homeless individual, in a prolonged chokehold on an uptown F train at Second Avenue. Witnesses reported that Neely was exhibiting erratic behaviour and shouting before the incident occurred.The jury deliberated on the criminally negligent homicide charge after Judge Maxwell Wiley dismissed the more serious manslaughter charge on Friday. The latter carried a maximum 15-year sentence, while the former has a four-year maximum. Neither offence has a minimum sentence requirement.Prosecutors contended that Penny caused Neely's death through a six-minute chokehold, maintaining it for 51 seconds after Neely became unresponsive. The prosecution argued Penny was aware of the potential fatal consequences but continued regardless.While the medical examiner attributed Neely's death to the chokehold, the defence suggested it resulted from a genetic condition and synthetic marijuana use. Defence lawyer Steven Raiser portrayed Penny's actions as protective measures for other passengers against what he described as Neely's threatening behaviour.The court rejected a defence motion for mistrial on Monday morning, which argued that dismissing the manslaughter charge would influence the jury's decision.","Daniel Penny, 26, found not guilty of putting unarmed homeless man Jordan Neely in fatal chokehold.

pledges action

Years of frustration and hope

The United States is accelerating its effort to find and secure the release of Austin Tice , an American journalist abducted in Syria 12 years ago.Roger Carstens , the US special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, travelled to Beirut as part of the ongoing mission to gather information on Tice’s whereabouts. State Department officials confirmed that these efforts have intensified following the recent overthrow of Bashar al-Assad's government.State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller emphasised the importance of this operation, stating, “We are ready to engage with any organisation that might have information about the whereabouts of Austin Tice.” He reiterated the US government's commitment, noting, “We will not rest until he is returned home safely to his loved ones.”Tice, a freelance photojournalist working for outlets such asand CBS, was detained at a checkpoint near Damascus on August 14, 2012.In a video released weeks later, he appeared blindfolded and surrounded by armed men, but the identity of his captors has remained unknown. Syria has consistently denied holding him.President Joe Biden underscored the urgency of the mission, saying on Sunday, “The US government believes Austin Tice is alive. We think we can get him back, but we have no direct evidence of that yet.” Biden also called for anyone with credible information to assist in the effort.Austin Tice’s parents, Marc and Debra Tice, remain hopeful. In a recent statement, they shared, “Austin Tice is alive, in Syria, and it’s time for him to come home. We are eagerly anticipating seeing Austin walk free and are asking anyone who can assist to please do so”, reported the news agency Reuters.Efforts to secure Tice’s release have been fraught with difficulty.According to Reuters, US intelligence received over the summer from a Lebanese source suggested that Tice was alive and possibly held by a group linked to Hezbollah . However, determining the accuracy of such reports has been challenging.Carstens’ visit to Lebanon aims to renew hope, as secretary of state Antony Blinken noted during a recent event, “With every party we engage, we’ll continue to seek information about Austin Tice so that we can find him and bring him home to his family and loved ones.”A $1 million FBI reward for information leading to Tice’s safe return remains active, further reflecting the US government’s commitment to resolving the case.","U.S. State Department officials confirmed that these efforts have intensified following the recent overthrow of Bashar al-Assad's government.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan ’s imprisoned ex-prime minister Imran Khan has threatened to launch a nationwide civil disobedience movement, in an apparent bid to keep his public mobilisation campaign intact and to force the country’s powerful authorities to agree to his demands.Less than two weeks after his “final call” protest in Islamabad was violently suppressed, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief has asked his supporters to converge on Dec 13 in the northwestern city of Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, to pay homage to party workers who were killed in the crackdown by security forces in Islamabad.His call for protest in Islamabad had mobilised thousands of supporters, primarily from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a province governed by his party. Imran’s party is believed to have organised the Dec 13 gathering in Peshawar keeping in mind his popularity in the region.Imran has also constituted a five-member team to discuss two key demands with govt: release of undertrial prisoners and a judicial probe into the crackdown on the Nov 26 protest march and the violence on May 9 last year. On both dates, PTI workers and Imran’s supporters held major protests, but faced a backlash from govt and security forces.“If these two demands are not accepted, a civil disobedience movement will begin on Dec 14. Govt will bear full responsibility for the consequences,” the PTI chief’s post in Urdu read.“As part of the movement, we will urge overseas Pakistanis to limit remittances and start a boycott campaign. In the second phase, we will escalate our actions further,” he added.The announcement followed Imran’s recent indictment for his involvement in an attack on military headquarters on May 9 last year, while he was also slapped with charges of terrorism for his role in protests that besieged Islamabad last month.Meanwhile, data submitted before the Islamabad high court revealed that the 72-year old cricketer-turned-politician is currently facing 188 criminal cases and inquiries. According to the data, he has been booked in 99 cases in Punjab, 76 in Islamabad and two in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.",Imran Khan has asked his supporters to converge in Peshawar on Dec 13.

Growing threat from Baloch separatists

Sectarian violence fuels instability

Border tensions and counterterrorism efforts

What lies ahead

Pakistan witnessed a sharp rise in terror attacks in November, with 61 incidents marking a 27% increase from the previous month, according to a report by the Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS). The number of fatalities also surged by 69%, climbing from 100 in October to 169, with 225 others injured.The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a banned group, carried out 12 attacks in November, including three high-impact incidents that resulted in 45 deaths. These figures surpassed the fatalities caused by the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), indicating a shift in the BLA's operational strategy. Experts suggest this escalation requires a reassessment of counterterrorism tactics.The majority of these attacks in Balochistan targeted security forces and civilians. Notable incidents included an assault on the Quetta railway station, an attack on a police van in Mastung, and a strike on a security check-post in Kalat, which collectively accounted for 91% of the province’s fatalities.Sectarian violence added another layer to the country's security challenges, particularly in the Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). Seven incidents, including two terror attacks and five sectarian clashes, claimed 115 lives and left 137 injured. The violence was triggered by an attack on passenger buses on November 21, which spiraled into broader sectarian unrest.KP remained the most affected province, with 41 terrorist attacks leading to 114 deaths and 95 injuries. The TTP, Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group, Lashkar-i-Islam, and other local factions were linked to most of these incidents.The report also highlighted six incidents of border violence along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, resulting in 25 terrorist deaths and 11 injuries. This underscores the ongoing instability in the region and the challenges posed by cross-border insurgents.Security forces conducted 19 counterterrorism operations in November, killing 53 terrorists. Most of these operations were concentrated in KP and Balochistan, the epicenters of recent violence.The PIPS report paints a grim picture of Pakistan's security landscape, with 98 conflict-related incidents causing 338 deaths and 411 injuries in November alone. Experts suggest that the evolving nature of terror threats, including the increasing lethality of BLA operations and persistent sectarian tensions, requires urgent and innovative policy responses.As Pakistan grapples with these challenges, the question remains: can the state adapt quickly enough to address the multifaceted threats destabilizing the country?","Pakistan witnessed a sharp rise in terror attacks in November, with 61 incidents marking a 27% increase from the previous month.

ISLAMABAD: A Pakistan anti-terrorism court indicted on Thursday former prime minister Imran Khan along with dozens of other Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) politicians on charges of inciting supporters to attack the country’s military installations on May 9, 2023.Following Khan’s arrest on May 9 last year, his supporters had attacked and torched several military buildings and offices to protest against what they describe as the illegal detention of their leader. At least eight people were killed in the violence that followed Khan’s arrest on alleged graft charges.Khan pleaded not guilty to the charges while the court also indicted more than 60 others, including opposition leader in the National Assembly Omar Ayub, in the same case linked to the attack on the army’s General Headquarters (GHQ) in the garrison city of Rawalpindi.

In a virtual address to a gathering of overseas Awami League supporters in London on Sunday, Hasina accused Yunus of being the ""mastermind"" behind the July-August turmoil that ousted her government and vowed to bring him and his allies to justice under Bangladeshi law.She criticized Yunus and his interim government for their alleged persecution of religious minorities in Bangladesh.""Since August 5, the attacks on minorities, places of worship of Hindus, Christians and Buddhists have been rampant. We condemn it. The Jamaat and terrorists are having a free run under the new regime,"" she said.The audio recording of Hasina's address was shared on the Facebook page of the Bangladesh Students' League and Bangladesh Awami League.Her remarks came ahead of Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri's visit to Dhaka Monday where he raised India's concerns over the safety of minorities, flagging ""regrettable incidents of attacks on cultural, religious and diplomatic properties"" in the country.There have been a spate of incidents of violence against Hindus and other minorities, as well as attacks on temples in Bangladesh in the last few weeks that triggered strong concerns in New Delhi.""Bangladesh is now under the grip of a fascist regime where people's democratic rights have been obliterated.
