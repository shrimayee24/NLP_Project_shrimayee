Expressing grief and condolences over the death of his followers, he wished for the speedy recovery of those injured.Locals, however, claimed the baba ""fled the scene"" on Tuesday afternoon when people were dying.He is now believed to be at his lavish ashram in Mainpuri along with some of his followers.

The couple has no children. After 1997, his ""spiritual journey"" gained momentum, and people started attending his discourses, seeking solutions to their problems. The baba claimed he could cure ailments just by touching people.Enticed by his ""miracles"", the number of devotees grew. He established his first ashram at his ancestral village of Bahadur Nagar. Subsequently, more ashrams came up in north India. The Mainpuri ashram was built a decade ago. ""His followers throng this place whether the baba is present or not.

"Hathras stampede: FIR names chief volunteer, but leaves out ‘Bhole Baba’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nod-for-80k-but-2-5-lakh-came-for-satsang-says-fir/articleshow/111472548.cms,":

HATHRASUP police on Wednesday registered an FIR in the Hathras stampede tragedy, naming ‘mukhya sevadar’ (chief volunteer) Devprakash Madhukar and other organisers of the religious congregation, but not mentioning the central conductor of the event, ‘Sakar Vishwa Hari Bhole Baba’, formerly known as Surajpal Singh.The FIR stated that the organisers “underreported the number of expected attendees, did not cooperate in managing traffic, and concealed evidence after the stampede, which occurred when people stopped to collect soil from the path of the baba’s vehicle.” The FIR indicated that the police and administration did everything possible with available resources.Filed at the Sikandra Rau police station, the FIR cited sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, including “culpable homicide not amounting to murder, attempt to commit culpable homicide, wrongful restraint, disobedience to a public servant’s order, and causing the disappearance of evidence.”Sub-inspector Brijesh Pandey, the complainant, said Madhukar and others organised the ‘ satsang ’ held between Fulrai and Mugalgarhi villages on G T Road in Sikandra Rau. They sought permission for about 80,000 attendees, but over 2.5 lakh people converged for the event, leading to severe traffic jams. Video clips circulating on social media platforms showed a large crowd listening to the baba seated on a throne.Eyewitnesses said that after the satsang, many devotees rushed to the exit while others moved in the opposite direction to collect soil, causing a deadly crowd build-up. “On the other side of the road, the crowd running in the field filled with ‘keechad’ (sludge) behind the baba’s car was forcibly stopped by the organising committee with sticks, increasing the pressure and resulting in people being crushed,” the FIR stated.Despite the chaos, police and administration officials managed to transport the injured to hospitals using all resources available, the FIR said, adding that the organisers and volunteers did not cooperate.When asked about potential arrests, UP chief secretary Manoj Kumar Singh said, “The ambit of the investigation is open.”“Right now, everything is a matter of investigation,” the chief secretary added. “We do not want to influence the investigation by drawing any immediate conclusion. Action will be taken based on the facts that come to light during the probe.”","FIR names Devprakash Madhukar and other organisers of religious congregation.

"Hathras stampede: Bhole Baba's villagers praises him, amid ongoing investigation",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hathras-stampede-bhole-babas-villagers-praises-him-amid-ongoing-investigation/articleshow/111465355.cms,"NEW DELHI: As gory details surfaced of the Hathras stampede that killed over 120 people, mainly women and children, the residents of self-proclaimed godman Bhole Baba 's village sprung to his defence on Wednesday, even praising him for not taking donations or 'chadhava (offerings)' from anyone.Saakar Vishwa Hari Bhole Baba, formerly known as Baba Narayan Hari, was once employed by the police department.He left his job to become a religious preacher after realizing that people were drawn to his ideas and attended his ' satsang ' (religious congregations) in large numbers.Initially, he held 'satsang' in his village Dham in Patiyali tehsil, but he discontinued them when the gatherings became too large and started damaging the crops of the poor villagers.The villagers stated that the preacher never solicited donations or ""chadhava"" from anyone. When asked about the construction of the 'Bhavya Dham', the villagers explained that it was built using the donations received from devotees, emphasizing that Baba never asked for anything from them. The women of the village spoke highly of Baba's conduct, saying that he only discussed matters related to God.Dhan Singh and Mohit Kumar, who live near the ashram, shared their experiences. Dhan Singh told PTI, ""Bahut badhiya mahaul hota tha unke satsang ka (The atmosphere in his 'satsang' used to be very nice)"". Jay Kumar, from Baba's birthplace at Bahadurnagar, mentioned that people appreciated his religious sermons and that lakhs of people attended his 'satsang', but such an incident had never occurred before.Kumar spoke highly of Baba, stating that people frequently visited his 'satsang'. Jagjivan Ram, also known as Govind, revealed that Baba had started 'satsang' from Agra, where he was posted in the police.The locals mentioned that Baba is over 60 years old and has no children. They shared an incident where Baba had adopted a girl who passed away around 16-17 years ago. Baba had kept her body at home for two days, hoping she would come back to life. The police had to intervene, and the girl was eventually cremated.Following the stampede at his 'satsang' in Hathras district, which claimed 121 lives and injured 31, Baba is said to be present at an ashram in Mainpuri. A large number of police personnel have been deployed outside the ashram, and officials remain tight-lipped about Baba's presence inside. Some police sources, however, confirmed that he is indeed inside the ashram. Access to the ashram at Bichhawan has been restricted, with police personnel from several stations deployed outside, and no one, including the media, is allowed inside.","Bhole Baba, formerly known as Baba Narayan Hari, was once employed by the police department.

AGRA: It was a catastrophe in the making at the religious event in Hathras on Tuesday as a large crowd began to surge forward in extreme hot and humid conditions to get close to preacher Bhole Baba for his blessings. Multiple eyewitness accounts revealed the event to be chaotic and ""people fell over each other in their urgency to exit"".A young woman, who was among the injured, said that several women and children fell on to the ground and couldn't get up due to the heavy rush, only to be crushed under the feet of the surging crowd, while cries of anguish filled the air.""It was a horrific scene of panic and chaos at the religious gathering,"" another witness said.The incident occurred at the conclusion of a spiritual discourse by the preacher, as the massive crowd began to disperse in haste while few devotees ran to touch feet of the storyteller (kathavachak).Locals said the scale of the gathering was unprecedented, with attendees from various states such as Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana at the tent venue.The parking area was located within a 3-km radius, and narrow exit routes were unable to accommodate the large influx of people, the locals added.Agra district resident Shyam Singh who was at the event said the main reason for the stampede was that the convoy of Bhole Baba was passing by and the crowd suddenly stopped. ""Once the satsang ended around 12.30pm, the crowd was stopped and Bhole Baba was being taken out through the back door. There was a deep pit there when some people, trying to take Baba's blessings, fell into it, and a stampede broke out. People kept passing by and trampling on each other. Many people died after falling into the pit,"" he said.

Frantic search on for the missing as Hathras stampede toll touches 121,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/frantic-search-on-for-the-missing-as-hathras-stampede-toll-touches-121/articleshow/111473338.cms,"HATHRAS: Bhoop Singh couldn't find his daughter in the slushy field that jutted away from NH 91, next to a road shiny with recently fallen rain. ""Laali, Laali,"" he screamed, wading through knee-deep water and waist-high growth, peering at bushes with trepidation. ""I've looked everywhere for her,"" he said, wiping the sweat from his face that had mixed with water and mud.As the Hathras administration and top UP govt officials put the number of those dead in the stampede on Tuesday at a self-styled godman's 'satsang' in the district's Phulrai village at 121, Singh feared his child could be one of them, or, worse, a victim yet to be accounted for.Hundreds of relatives since late Tuesday night have been involved in a heartbreaking search for their loved ones along stretches of the Delhi-Etah highway, in clearings and waterlogged plantations and fields.The hunt for the missing has now raised a question: Are there more bodies to be spotted and counted? Or, are some of the missing women and children being treated in hospitals in neighbouring districts with their relatives yet to reach them?I have no clue where she went,” said Singh. “Laali was lost in the crowd. She was not in any of the hospitals that I have scanned. She is too small. I don't know what to do.” He added, “These fields are filled with water, she could have drowned... I’m so helpless.There are many like me looking for their daughters, mothers and sisters...” Singh, a resident of Bahjoi, had come to attend the satsang of Surajpal Singh, also known as Bhole Baba and Narayan Saakar Hari, with his nine-year-old daughter.He said, “There was already a large crowd when the prayer meeting started and then it quickly began to swell. She could have been swept anywhere with the force of the crowd. Even men were unable to bear that (pressure).” Another man, Rajesh Yadav, a resident of Etah, looked around for his mother Uma Devi (65), who had come with a ‘sangat’ (group of women) to attend the satsang. “She was staying in a tent near the venue,” Yadav wept. “My mother doesn't have a phone,” he said desperately.“By around 8pm, we reached Sikandra Rau where the event was being held. Cries of death and chaos filled the air amid the sirens of ambulances and police vehicles ferrying the injured and dead. I went to a hospital and just sat down on the floor after I saw a huge pile of bodies. What should I do now?” Through the night, a TOI team saw bodies being brought in tempos and even trucks. People checked the corpses in the hope of identifying their kin.Yadav told this correspondent that he had inspected almost a hundred dead faces. “I still can’t find my mother.” Many of the victims were first brought to Sikandra Rau’s combined health centre. From there, a large group was shifted to other hospitals in Hathras, Aligarh, Etah and Kasganj.In most cases, without informing their families. Some distance away, Aligarh resident Kuldeep Kumar told TOI that his 32-year-old wife and fiveyear-old daughter are nowhere to be found. “I went to the hospital. Nothing there for me,” he said, exhausted, as others hunting for their kin in the slush and mud tried to give him confidence. At least five bodies were discovered in the bushes early on Wednesday, they said.","Hundreds of relatives have been involved in a heartbreaking search for their loved ones.

'Second American revolution if...': Right-wing think tank head says they are in the process of 'taking country back',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/second-american-revolution-if-right-wing-think-tank-head-says-they-are-in-the-process-of-taking-country-back/articleshow/111473578.cms,"Kevin Roberts , president of the right-wing think tank The Heritage Foundation , said that the recent Supreme Court decision on Presidential immunity could support a second American revolution , as outlined in the foundation's Project 2025 plan.According to a report in Newsweek, Roberts explained on Steve Bannon's War Room podcast, how the ruling might facilitate the implementation of conservative policies if Donald Trump wins the presidency in November and adopts Project 2025.According to Roberts, the Supreme Court's decision on Monday, which states that presidents are immune from prosecution for ""official acts,"" will allow them to introduce policies without having to ""triple guess, every decision they're making in their official capacity.""""In spite of all this nonsense from the left, we are going to win. We're in the process of taking this country back,"" he added.Project 2025's vision of a bloodless revolution involves dismantling what Roberts calls ""the deep state"" by removing civil service employment protections for federal employees with policy-related job titles. This would make it easier to fire and replace civil servants with Republican loyalists, Newsweek reported.""In spite of all this nonsense from the left, we are going to win. We're in the process of taking this country back,"" Roberts said.""We are in the process of the second American Revolution, which will remain bloodless, if the left allows it to be,"" he added.The project also proposes implementing several right-wing policies, such as eliminating the Department of Education, reducing the scope of social welfare programs, favoring the fossil fuel industry, limiting access to abortion pills, and removing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) hiring policies from federal programs.Notably, Project 2025 aims to consolidate executive power by reducing the independence of federal agencies and increasing presidential control over policy implementation, which aligns with the recent Supreme Court ruling. However, the proposals have faced criticism from experts like Professor Erwin Chemerinsky, who argues that Project 2025 is ""inconsistent with the structure and goals of the Constitution.""Roberts appeared on the War Room podcast during its first broadcast without host Steve Bannon, who is serving a four-month sentence for defying a congressional subpoena.Bannon is a strong supporter of Project 2025 and believes that the Make America Great Again movement will govern the United States for 50 years. During the episode, Roberts encouraged listeners, stating, ""We're in the process of taking this country back. No one in the audience should be despairing.""","Kevin Roberts, president of the right-wing think tank The Heritage Foundation, said that the recent Supreme Court decision on Presidential immunity could support a second American revolution.

Donald Trump keeps low profile while Joe Biden faces furor over candidacy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-keeps-low-profile-while-joe-biden-faces-furor-over-candidacy/articleshow/111473647.cms,"Former President Donald Trump has finally learned a key rule of politics: never interrupt your enemy when he’s making a mistake.The presumptive Republican nominee has largely disappeared from the national stage in the aftermath of President Joe Biden ’s disastrous debate performance, clearing way for Democrats’ anxieties to overwhelm the news cycle and ratchet up political pressure on his opponent.Aside from a celebratory rally last Friday, Trump has largely gone silent — even canceling a planned television interview with a Virginia network, according to local outlet 13News Now. After flirting with announcing his vice presidential pick in the days before the debate, his campaign reverted to their original plans to unveil the pick closer to the Republican convention.Trump has been rewarded by an opponent in freefall, with polls showing the Republican candidate widening his lead over the president both nationally and in swing states while Democratic lawmakers openly declare that they don’t believe their party will retain control of the White House in November.The former president and his advisers concede they don’t know how the episode will resolve itself, and that they’re not sure how Biden withdrawing from the ticket might impact the race’s dynamics. Vice President Kamala Harris , in particular, could offer voters a younger face and offset inroads Trump has made with women, independents, and voters of color.“I’m going to show up and I’m going to campaign whether it’s him or somebody else,” Trump said in an interview with Richmond, Virginia radio station WRVA.But Trump’s relative self-restraint has given Republican strategists hope that he’ll be able to avoid pitfalls of his own making through the campaign’s final four months.“Trump can be a disciplined messenger when he wants to be,” Republican strategist Doug Heye said in an interview. “By staying out of the spotlight — not announcing a veep pick, for instance — he keeps the very negative spotlight on Biden.”Democrats, by contrast, have desperately tried to bring Trump’s behavior back into the headlines — to no avail. Biden’s bid to focus attention on Trump’s conduct after the Supreme Court offered a broad interpretation of presidential immunity was quickly overwhelmed by his own political woes.Aides at Biden’s Wilmington, Delaware headquarters have said returning focus to Trump is essential as the president charts an increasingly narrow path back to competitiveness. On Wednesday, his team released a new ad arguing Trump “already led an insurrection and threatened to be a dictator.”“We must remind people of the choice in this election,” Biden’s campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez and chair Jen O’Malley Dillon said in an email to staff.Publicly, Trump has commented little on the calls for Biden to drop out of the race and the growing uncertainty within Democratic ranks, though he did express skepticism in his WRVA interview.“If he doesn’t want that to happen, then it can’t happen because he has the votes,” Trump said on Monday. “He’s got all these delegates.”Laying low has offered the former president other advantages. For one, his campaign has avoided spending money on costly rallies — helping to preserve a cash advantage over the president. It’s also allowed for some holiday-week golfing at Trump’s Bedminster club in New Jersey.Trump and his top advisers have expressed skepticism that Biden would step aside, but have ratcheted up attacks on Harris and other Democrats as the clamor for the president to exit the race has grown.In a statement Wednesday, Trump senior advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles argued Democrats have purposely hid the truth of Biden’s physical and mental state.“President Trump will beat any Democrat on November 5th because he has a proven record,” they said, going on to call Harris a “cackling copilot.”MAGA Inc, the political action committee supporting Trump’s bid, released a statement calling Harris the administration’s “invasion czar” — in reference to the vice president’s portfolio addressing the root causes of migration — and attacking her record on immigration and the economy.A post-debate CNN survey released Tuesday found that Harris was polling better than Biden in a hypothetical matchup against Trump. While the Republican candidate led Harris 47%-45%, he was favored over Biden by a 49%-43% margin.The National Republican Congressional Committee released an ad on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Wednesday that highlighted Biden’s age and reminded voters that Harris would be next in line.“This November: Vote Republican. Stop Kamala,” the ad read, while videos of Harris laughing played to the tune of ominous music.",The presumptive Republican nominee has largely disappeared from the national stage in the aftermath of President Joe Biden ’s disastrous debate performance. The former president and his advisers concede they don’t know how the episode will resolve itself. But Trump’s relative self-restraint has given Republican strategists hope that he’ll be able to avoid pitfalls of his own making.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111473783,imgsize-1808881,width-400,resizemode-4/111473783.jpg"

The fire ignited off Grubbs Road and Brollier Way in Palermo just before 4 pm (local time) on Wednesday, according to unofficial sources, including the Watch Duty App.Fire fighters lined roads and helicopters dropped water on the growing wildfire on Wednesday in Northern California , which has forced at least 26,000 people to evacuate.The state is currently experiencing extreme heat. The Grubbs fire is just one of many fire s affecting the region. The Thompson fire , which broke out before noon Tuesday about 70 miles north of Sacramento near Oroville, has grown to more than 5.5 square miles and sent up a huge plume of smoke visible from space. Despite the challenging conditions, Oroville Mayor David Pittman reported a significant drop in fire activity by Wednesday afternoon, expressing hope that some residents could soon return home.

Red flag warnings for critical fire weather conditions, including gusty winds and low humidity, were in effect when the fire erupted. The conditions have led Pacific Gas and Electric to implement targeted public safety power shutoffs in parts of some Northern California counties to prevent fire s from being ignited by downed or damaged wires.Hot conditions with potential triple-digit temperatures are expected to continue into next week. Authorities have warned of full legal consequences for any illegal use of fire works during the Fourth of July holiday.Governor Gavin Newsom announced late Tuesday that federal funding had been approved to assist with fire fighting efforts. The State Operations Center has been activated to coordinate California's response, dispatch mutual aid, and support communities as they respond to wildfire and excessive heat threats.In Southern California, Joshua Tree National Park officials closed Covington Flats on Wednesday due to extreme fire risk. The area is home to important Joshua tree populations, which are at risk due to abundant grass that has dried after spring rains. A June 2023 fire burned 1.6 square miles of Joshua trees and desert tortoise habitat.","Evacuation orders for the Grubbs fire in Palermo have been reduced to warnings, according to the county's evacuation map. The Thompson fire, which broke out before noon Tuesday about 70 miles north of Sacramento near Oroville, has grown to more than 5.5 square miles and sent up a huge plume of smoke.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111472971,imgsize-1822343,width-400,resizemode-4/111472971.jpg"

The press briefing came on the back of intense speculations over Biden option out of the race, Kamala Harris' approval rate soaring, both making a joint appearance and the White House asserting that Biden is not opting out -- all in a day.Karine was asked whether Biden was jet-lagged because his international trip was almost a week and a half ago. The press secretary said Biden already spoke about the debate in front of his supporters and he owned that the debate was not his best night. In addition to two major trips, Biden was doing his presidential duties, debate preparation and he had a cold and jet lag, the press secretary said.""The president travels six time zones forward to G7 in Italy, 9 time zones back to LA and 3 time zones forward again to DC...and on top of that he did have a cold...we certainly don't want to explain that away,"" she said.Based on reports that Biden is prone to gaffes beyond the 10-4 window, the press secretary Wednesday was asked about Biden's schedule outside that specific time period. ""Well, you heard him speak to supporters yesterday outside 4 pm. You saw the president landing in North Carolina in the middle of the night. He was greeting hundreds of supporters...so he's been pretty much out there after 4 pm and before 10 am, for sure,"" she said.""Let me be very clear about this.

The agency said it was a pep talk, stressing the stakes of the election and returning to Biden's previous post-debates comments that when he gets knocked down he gets back up and still plans to win the election.The joint appearance came as New York Times reported that Biden was mulling whether to continue in the race.The report claimed Biden has told a key ally that he knows he may not be able to salvage his candidacy if he cannot convince the public in the coming days that he is up for the job. The White House, on the other hand, dismissed the reports and said Biden was not withdrawing from the race.Meanwhile, Kamala Harris emerged with a better chance of retaining the White House, according to the latest CNN poll.Biden convened the meeting with Kamala Harris and a group of influential Democratic governors amid speculations that he may announce his decision to drop out of the re-election bid. But the meeting was like a pep talk confirming that Kamala Harris was not going to take Biden's place and Biden was not mulling to opt out either.The June 27 debate saw an escalation of things as Democrats became growingly doubtful over Biden. A Democratic congressman publicly called on the president to step aside — the first lawmaker from his party to do so — and several others publicly cast doubt on his ability to beat Trump in November. Public opinion polls published since then have shown Biden losing ground to his Republican rival. A new CBS News poll conducted after the debate and published on Wednesday showed Trump with a two-point lead over Biden nationally. The same poll gave Biden a lead a month ago. On Tuesday, a CNN poll conducted after the debate showed Biden’s approval rating had plunged to an all-time low and found that Harris polled better than him in a hypothetical match-up against Trump.As a vice president, Kamala Harris had a low approval rating but as a potential replacement for Biden, her rating gained momentum after the debate. Betting markets Wednesday turned sharp upwards in Kamal's favor.The vice president maintained a low profile since the debate and her lunch Wednesday was her first face-to-face meeting with the president after the debate.","Biden and Harris made a surprise joint appearance on a Democratic National Committee call, reiterating to staffers that they are in this fight for reelection together.

Kamala blooms as debate debacle threatens to tank Biden bid for second term,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-blooms-as-debate-debacle-threatens-to-tank-biden-bid-for-second-term/articleshow/111465590.cms,"WASHIGNTON: Mutiny has broken out in the US Democrat ranks with the first party lawmakers publicly calling for President Joe Biden to quit the 2024 race following his disastrous debate performance last week.Although Biden has virtually sealed the party nomination well before the party convention in August, Vice-president Kamala Harris is tipped to replace him if he bows to growing skepticism about his ability to win a second term.At least three Congressmen broke ranks on Tuesday asking Biden to bow out, even as his aides and supporters, including his wife Jill Biden, tried to reassure donors and party rank and file that he will bounce back from his debate debacle . While he has appeared more energetic in public rallies and appearances after the debate, Biden did himself no favors by saying he nearly fell asleep during the debate because of fatigue from international travel.“I didn’t have my best night, but the fact is that you know, I wasn’t very smart,"" Biden said at a campaign fundraiser on Monday. ""I decided to travel around the world a couple times, going through around 100 time zones ... before ... the debate.""Didn’t listen to my staff and came back and nearly fell asleep on stage. That's no excuse but it is an explanation,"" he added.The US President , at 82 the oldest to hold office, traveled to France and Italy in two separate trips in two weeks last month.He flew overnight from the Group of Seven summit in Bari, Italy, to appear at a fundraiser with former President Barack Obama in Los Angeles on June 15 before returning to Washington the following day. But he then spent six days at Camp David preparing for the June 27 debate, where he suffered brain freeze on occasions and was often incomprehensible.Although party grandees like former President Obama and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi publicly took a charitable view of the debacle, skepticism about Biden's viability for a second term is rippling through the party rank and file, with many lawmakers -- dubbed the ""bedwetting brigade"" by the President's supporters -- in a panic mode.Texas Congressman Lloyd Doggett became the first Democratic lawmaker to go public asking Biden to quit the race, saying, ""President Biden saved our democracy by delivering us from Trump in 2020. He must not deliver us to Trump in 2024.""""President Biden has continued to run substantially behind Democratic senators in key states and in most polls has trailed Donald Trump. I had hoped that the debate would provide some momentum to change that. It did not. Instead of reassuring voters, the President failed to effectively defend his many accomplishments and expose Trump's many lies,"" Doggett said.In a new effort to allay party and voter concern, Biden aides have scheduled several public events and an unscripted interview on ABC News on Friday, which will bring even greater focus on his mental acuity. Any more missteps and his candidacy may well be toast.That would bring into play, Kamala Harris, who as vice-president and his running mate in 2024, could inherit the campaign infrastructure and funds raised by Biden.Although several other prominent Democrats, including California governor Gavin Newsom and Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer are being discussed as potential replacements, Harris has the best name recognition and the advantage of being in national office.In a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday, Harris, trailed Trump by one point -- 42% to 43% -- a difference well within the poll's 3.5 per cent margin of error.But Harris herself has been cautious about writing off the man who picked her to be his running mate when her presidential campaign tanked badly in 2019.""Vice President Harris looks forward to serving a second term with President Joe Biden,"" a statement from her office said on Tuesday in a vote of confidence for Biden.Despite running Trump close in the Reuters/Ipsos poll, Harris is seen as a weak candidate, partly on account of the US never having elected a woman -- much less one of color to the White House. Her performance and profile as Biden's vice-president has also not been particularly striking.But with only 47 days to go before the Democratic Convention in Chicago starting August 19 -- and 125 days till the November 5 election -- a Biden to Harris ticket would be the most obvious and logical transition given the time, money and effort it will take for other candidates to step up.","Biden has virtually sealed the party nomination well before the party convention in August.

"Pakistan slams UN body report calling Imran’s arrest 'arbitrary, politically motivated'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-slams-un-body-report-calling-imrans-arrest-arbitrary-politically-motivated/articleshow/111440399.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Tuesday denounced a UN report that termed the detention of former prime minister Imran Khan as “arbitrary and in violation of international law”, asserting that the arrest of the cricketer-turned-politician and the cases against him were an “internal matter” of the country.Imran, the founder of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, has been in jail since August last year following his conviction in a Toshakhana case.The Election Commission of Pakistan subsequently disqualified him for five years, ahead of the national elections in Feb. He is also facing prosecution in the cipher and Iddat cases.In an opinion released on Monday, the Geneva-based UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention concluded that Imran’s detention had no legal basis, and appeared to have been intended to disqualify him from running for political office. “…From the outset, that prosecution was not grounded in law and was reportedly instrumentalised for a political purpose,” it stated, adding that Imran’s legal woes were part of a “much larger campaign of repression” against him and his party.In the run-up to the 2024 general election, the working group report stated, PTI members were arrested and tortured and their rallies were disrupted. It also alleged “widespread fraud on the election day”.The “appropriate remedy would be to release Mr Khan immediately and accord him an enforceable right to compensation and other reparations, in accordance with international law”, the UN working group said.Imran and his party have always maintained that the charges against him are politically motivated and aimed at thwarting his return to power.In recent months, courts have suspended Imran’s sentence in some cases and also overturned his conviction on charges of leaking state secrets. However, he has remained behind bars following his conviction in the Iddat case, with a trial court ruling that Imran’s 2018 marriage had violated Islamic law. Khan also faces a trial under anti-terrorism charges in connection with the violence in May last year.Responding to the UN report, Pakistan’s law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said, “As a sovereign state, the constitution and prevailing laws are enforced by courts in Pakistan. PTI founder has all rights as per the national constitution and law and international norms. He is in jail as a convicted prisoner.”In his statement, Tarar said court relief to the PTI founder in some of the cases was “a reflection of a transparent and fair trial and judicial system”. “Any demand beyond the constitution, law and international norms will be called discriminatory, biased and unfair,” he added.Last Friday, Pakistan’s parliament had denounced a US congressional resolution that called for an independent investigation into allegations that the country’s elections were rigged.",Imran Khan has been in jail since August last year following his conviction in a Toshakhana case.

This sentencing follows a severe mob attack targeting Christians in the eastern Punjab province last year.In August 2023, violence erupted in Faisalabad's Jaranwala when some local Muslims claimed to have seen a Christian, Raja Amir, and his friend tearing pages from a Quran, throwing them on the ground, and writing insulting remarks on other pages.Police chief Rizwan Khan said the alleged act angered the local Muslims, who attacked multiple churches and several Christian homes, burning furniture and other household items. Some members of the Christian community fled their homes to escape the mob.Ehsan Shan, who was not directly involved in the alleged desecration, was accused of reposting the defaced Quranic pages on his TikTok account, according to his lawyer, Khurram Shahzad. Shahzad also stated his intention to appeal the death sentence , which was handed down on Saturday by a court in Sahiwal, Punjab province.Amir Farooq, the police officer responsible for Shan's arrest, said that the man shared ""the hateful content at a sensitive time when authorities were already struggling to contain the violence.""Naveed Kashif, a local priest in Sahiwal, questioned ""why the court ordered such an extreme verdict when those linked to the attacks are yet to be punished,"" while acknowledging that he did not condone Shan's actions, AP reported.In Pakistan, a country with a Muslim majority - Blasphemy is a burning issue. Even mere claims of disrespect towards Islam and its Prophet Mohammed can incite violent and deadly responses from vigilante groups.Ever since 2011, when Punjab Governor Salmaan Taseer was assassinated by his own bodyguard for advocating the reform of blasphemy laws, since then there has been little to no deliberations over this issue.Earlier this month, 72-year-old Nazir Masih succumbed to injuries sustained during an attack by an angry mob in May, following accusations of blasphemy.","Ehsan Shan was accused of reposting the defaced Quranic pages on his TikTok account, according to his lawyer, Khurram Shahzad.

When the sentry obliged, the prisoner overpowered him, snatched his keys, and opened other barracks from where at least 19 prisoners made their way to the main gate, according to Dawn citing police.At that time, a pistol was thrown inside through the roof , which was used to break the lock from the inside.

The opposition in the Pakistan 's Punjab assembly held a session on Saturday amidst the rising tensions with the treasury, vowing to reject Maryam Nawaz as the chief minister and referring to her as ""fake Form-47,"" while the speaker took action and suspended all opposition leaders.According to the Pakistan-based Dawn the conflict between opposition lawmakers from the PTI (Sunni Ittehad Council) and ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz ( PML-N ) lawmakers intensified after 11 opposition members were suspended for 15 sittings due to ""rowdyism"" during Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz's address on Friday.The situation further intensified when the government revoked the perks and privileges of opposition leader Malik Ahmad Khan Bhachar and sealed his chamber in the assembly.As the session began on Saturday, a large contingent of police and a prisoner van were stationed outside the Punjab Assembly, with instructions to prevent the 11 suspended lawmakers from entering the premises. In a show of solidarity with the suspended lawmakers, the opposition legislators conducted their own session outside the assembly gate, making statements against Maryam Nawaz and the PML-N leadership.Ahmad Khan Bhachar said, ""The government wants to silence us through civil dictatorship, but we will never accept fake Form-47 CM Maryam Nawaz,"" while addressing the charged Members of the Provincial Assembly.At his speech, the PTI lawmakers shouted slogans like ""mandate thieves"" and accused Maryam Nawaz's father and PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif , of corruption.In addition, the PTI lawmakers initiated a privilege motion against Punjab Assembly Speaker Malik Ahmad Khan, alleging that he had succumbed to ""submitting to CM Maryam's pressure"" to suspend opposition members.
