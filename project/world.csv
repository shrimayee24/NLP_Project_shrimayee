IAF officer files rape complaint with cops against Wing Commander,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iaf-officer-files-rape-complaint-with-cops-against-wing-commander/articleshow/113239077.cms,"NEW DELHI: An IAF officer has filed a police complaint against a senior, accusing him of rape, outraging her modesty and continuous mental harassment at the Srinagar Air Force station in J&K, while also claiming that the "" internal committee "" of the force dismissed her allegations without proper consideration.The woman, a Flying Officer , has alleged that the accused, a Wing Commander, called her to his room after a new year party at the officers' mess on Dec 31 last year on the pretext of her not having received the gift being distributed at the function.On entering the room, when she asked where the Wing Commander's wife and children were, he replied they were elsewhere. She alleged he then forced her into oral sex and molested her. ""I repeatedly asked him to stop and tried to resist it. Finally, I pushed him and ran away,"" she said, in the FIR lodged at the Budgam police station on Sept 8.IAF, on being contacted by TOI, said: ""We are aware the woman officer has lodged an FIR. Budgam Police have approached the air force station (Srinagar) authorities. IAF is fully cooperating in the investigation.""""I was afraid and didn't know what to do as there were instances before also wherein, I was discouraged to report.

The IC was assembled only after two months. ""The bias of the station authorities to aid the sexual offender was very heart breaking,"" she said, alleging that a medical examination was not done till she insisted multiple times.The IC said the evidence was ""inconclusive"" because there was no eyewitness and closed the probe on May 15. ""Isn't it common sense that someone would not do sexual assault in front of a witness?"" she said.""I am forced to socialise with these people and attend events with my abuser,"" she added.","An IAF officer has filed a police complaint against a senior, accusing him of rape, outraging her modesty and continuous mental harassment at the Srinagar Air Force station in J&K.

A vote for Kamala Harris is a vote for Dick Cheney -- the architect of everything that has gone wrong in the Middle East for the last few decades,"" Tulsi Gabbard said.The former Democrat leader said mainstream media is projecting that not much can be expected of Kamala Harris as she does not have much time -- she became the candidate after Biden opted out. ""They are conveniently ignoring the fact that she's been there working in the White House alongside Joe Biden for the last 3.5 years. She's been the last one in the room, according to her, as these big decisions are being made,"" Tulsi said adding that Kamala said she was honored to have Dick Cheney's endorsement.""A lot of you must have served in the Middle East like I did.

Vice President Kamala Harris may have missed a crucial chance that could affect her path to the presidency, according to election expert Nate Silver . In his "" Silver Bulletin "" newsletter, Silver criticized Harris' decision to select Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate, instead of Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, a move he believes could cost her key swing states like Pennsylvania.Silver wrote that Harris ""blew one big opportunity to tack to the center with her selection of [Minnesota Gov.] Tim Walz rather than [Pennsylvania Gov.] Josh Shapiro."" He argued that Shapiro, whose leadership in Pennsylvania is well-regarded, would have been a more strategic choice to appeal to moderate voters, despite backlash from far-left Democrats over Shapiro’s pro-Israel stance. ""A tiny minority of progressives objected to Shapiro,"" Silver noted, adding that ""was an argument in Shapiro’s favor, if anything.""Polls reflect a broader issue for Harris, with a New York Times/Siena College poll showing 47% of likely voters viewing her as too liberal, a perception tied to her 2020 presidential campaign. Silver commented on this, saying, ""[Harris] is a more talented politician than she showed in 2019, and it’s a shame that her campaign that year was run by people who seemingly thought Elizabeth Warren was a right-winger.""Silver’s analysis also highlighted Harris' struggles with white voters without college degrees, rural voters, and older voters—key demographics in swing states like Pennsylvania. ""Harris is faring poorly among white voters without college degrees, rural voters, and older voters: the types of voters who are plentiful in Blue Wall states like Pennsylvania,"" Silver warned.As Harris prepares for her first debate against Donald Trump in Philadelphia, Silver suggested the polling results should be a wake-up call. ""She should campaign like she’s two points behind — because if the Times poll is right, she is,"" he wrote.With Pennsylvania's 19 electoral votes crucial to determining the election, Harris' missed opportunity in selecting a running mate may have significant consequences as the race unfolds.","Vice President Kamala Harris may have missed a crucial chance that could affect her path to the presidency.

Yagi's devastation: A national crisis

Storm continues to threaten

In a devastating turn of events, the Phong Chau Bridge in northern Vietnam collapsed dramatically as Super Typhoon Yagi unleashed its full force over the weekend. The catastrophic failure of the busiest bridge in the country was captured in harrowing dashcam footage, showing vehicles plunging into the Red River below as floodwaters surged.The moment of disaster was starkly witnessed when a lorry, unable to stop in time, plunged into the raging waters as the bridge decking gave way.Deputy Prime Minister Ho Duc Phoc confirmed that ten cars and two scooters had fallen into the river.Nguyen Minh Hai , who was riding his motorcycle across the bridge when it collapsed, described his terrifying experience: “I was so scared when I fell down. I felt like I’d just escaped death. I can’t swim and I thought I would have died,” he said from his hospital bed, as reported by BBC.Watch video-The collapse occurred on Monday, following the typhoon's landfall on Saturday. More than 60 lives have been lost since Yagi struck, making it one of the deadliest storms to hit Vietnam in three decades. As rescue operations continued, authorities reported that 13 people were still missing, and searches were underway to locate them.In response to the disaster, the military has been mobilized to construct a temporary pontoon bridge to span the gap left by the collapse. Meanwhile, efforts to rescue survivors from the river have so far saved at least three people.The ongoing damage assessment revealed that part of the 375-meter (1,230-foot) bridge remains intact, though it is unclear when full repairs will be completed.Typhoon Yagi, which brought winds of up to 203 km/h (126 mph), has wreaked widespread havoc across northern Vietnam. The storm left 1.5 million people without power and caused severe infrastructural damage.The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development reported that landslides and flash floods, triggered by the typhoon, resulted in at least 44 deaths, including a 68-year-old woman, a one-year-old boy, and a newborn baby.The storm's wrath extended beyond human casualties; it tore roofs from buildings, uprooted trees, and inflicted extensive damage on factories. Notably, images from Reuters depict the collapsed walls of an LG Electronics factory in Hai Phong city, illustrating the typhoon's destructive force.Though Yagi has weakened into a tropical depression, authorities have warned that it will continue to cause disruptions as it moves westward. With more than 240 people injured, and the damage continuing to unfold, the full impact of Vietnam's most powerful storm of the year is still being assessed.","The Phong Chau Bridge in northern Vietnam collapsed as Super Typhoon Yagi struck.

'No knowledge of the game'

NEW DELHI: There has been discussion regarding the intrusion of politics into sports as a result of Pakistan 's dismal recent results in international cricket. It is argued that nepotism at the top is impeding progress on the field.Last week, following a shocking 0-2 home series loss to Bangladesh, Pakistan dropped to ninth place in the Test rankings-their lowest position in almost sixty years.It was the nation's tenth consecutive home Test match without a victory, and it came after the team suffered humiliating early eliminations from the 50-over and T20 World Cups the previous year.Mohsin Naqvi , the current chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ), who also works full-time as the interior minister of a country that is experiencing an increase in terrorist attacks.Over the last 24 months, Pakistani cricket has seen four different coaches, three different board chairs, three different captains, and multiple domestic competition formats-unpredictability that analysts attribute to political whims.""This has a knock-on effect on team performance,"" said cricket journalist and former PCB media manager Ahsan Iftikhar Nagi.""When we have chaos and chronic instability within the management of the board it will reflect on-field performances,"" he told AFP.Pakistan's favorite sport is unquestionably cricket, with players hailed as national heroes, sponsored by luxury brands, and packed stadiums for big matches.With over 240 million people in the country, the sport has great cultural and political cachet because it transcends all social divisions.After leading his team to win in the 1992 ODI World Cup, former prime minister Imran Khan used his achievements as an international player to launch his political career.He was prime minister from 2018 to 2022, but he is presently incarcerated on allegations he says were made up to keep him from running in the elections earlier this year.This Monday, he released a statement from prison in which he detailed numerous grievances over his incarceration and explained how the political intrigues he claims are impeding him are to blame for the problems in cricket.""Favourites have been imposed to run a technical sport like cricket. What are Mohsin Naqvi's qualifications?"" he asked, claiming Naqvi had ""annihilated"" the team.""Nations are destroyed when corrupt and incompetent people are placed into positions of power in state institutions,"" he claimed.In Pakistan, nepotism and favoritism are pervasive. According to commentators, Khan ran on a platform of fighting corruption, but the strong military establishment helped him win the election and into office.The former superstar's tenure in government, during which he appointed his own preferred PCB chief and meddled in the local game structure, coincided with the national team's decline.Journalist Najam Sethi, who was chosen three times to lead the PCB, claimed the position had become into a ""sinecure"" meant to boost one's prestige.""Generals, judges and bureaucrats, just for a love of the game -- but no knowledge of the game -- have been appointed,"" he said.""Also, the cricketers with knowledge of the game but no managerial experience have been appointed.""The 2017 ICC Champions Trophy was Pakistan's most recent significant victory. They last prevailed in a home Test match in February 2021.They made it to the 2022 T20 World Cup final, which was their most noteworthy accomplishment. However, they lost shockingly to Ireland and the United States in the first round of the 2024 competition.Naqvi and the system that installed him have come under heightened scrutiny in parliament and the media following Bangladesh's defeat, prompting calls for his resignation.""Since 1998, hand-picked favourites of the respective ruling regimes in the country have taken turns as PCB chairmen to run the game in their own clueless manner, only to ruin it,"" the Express Tribune said.""They are busy working on their own respective agendas, which primarily relate to saving their own skin and seat, or making good money at the expense of the country's cricket.""The incongruity of Naqvi's two appointments became apparent when he presided over a press conference recently where the topics of a mass-casualty militant attack and cricket were discussed.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's close adviser Rana Sanaullah Khan seemed to be hinting this week that support for the PCB chief was eroding at the top.""It is his choice"" whether to continue, he told local news channel ARY. ""These two jobs are full-time roles.""","Pakistan dropped to ninth place in the Test rankings-their lowest position in almost sixty years.

In a notable moment during Tuesday night’s presidential debate, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump shared a handshake, marking their first face-to-face meeting in the campaign.As the debate began, both candidates took the stage for what was their initial direct encounter. Initially, Trump seemed to head towards his podium without acknowledging Harris, who was approaching the center of the stage.In a gesture of politeness, Harris altered her path to meet Trump at his podium, extending her hand.“Kamala Harris. How are you?” Harris greeted.“Nice to see you, I'm fine,” Trump responded as he shook her hand.“Let’s have a good debate,” Harris replied.The handshake signified the end of an eight-year period without handshakes on the presidential debate stage. Although there are no formal rules or stipulations requiring such gestures, this exchange added a touch of civility to the high-stakes political confrontation.Kamala Harris and Donald Trump faced off for the first time in what might be their only debate before the November presidential election, offering a dramatic glimpse into their contrasting visions for the country. The debate came after a tumultuous summer for both candidates and presented a critical opportunity to sway undecided voters.The encounter provided Americans with their clearest view yet of a campaign that has shifted significantly since the last debate in June, which saw President Joe Biden withdraw from the race. Harris immediately targeted Trump, linking him to the conservative Project 2025 agenda and GOP efforts to restrict abortion access, while also criticizing his inflammatory rhetoric.Trump countered by questioning Harris’s effectiveness as vice president and attacking her handling of illegal migration. He made several contentious claims about migrants, including an assertion that they are “taking jobs” from African Americans and Hispanics. Harris, seemingly unfazed, responded with a smirk when Trump repeated baseless accusations about immigrants.The debate took place in a small, blue-lit amphitheater turned television studio, devoid of a live audience, which minimized the typical noise of applause or jeers. The close proximity of the candidates’ lecterns highlighted the intensity of the debate.Following the June 27 debate, which led to Biden’s exit from the race, Trump survived an assassination attempt, and both sides finalized their running mates. This debate, hosted by ABC News, represents a rare instance of sustained questioning for Harris, who has given only one formal interview in the past six weeks.Early ballots for the presidential race are set to be distributed just hours after the debate, with absentee ballots beginning to go out in Alabama on Wednesday.",Kamala Harris and Donald Trump faced off for the first time in what might be their only debate before the November presidential election.

Gray was informed that a teacher had already raised concerns about Colt making references to school shootings. Despite this, the response to her warning was tragically inadequate.“The counselor said, ‘Well, I wanted to let you know that earlier this morning one of Colt’s teachers had sent me an email that said Colt had been making references to school shootings,’” Marcee Gray said.“I told them it was an extreme emergency and for them to go immediately and find Colt to check on him,” Marcee Gray later said in a text message to her sister. “I don’t understand what took them so long.”In addition to Gray’s alarming call, there were other warning signs earlier that day. Authorities revealed that an anonymous caller had warned of planned attacks on multiple schools, including Apalachee High, further escalating the day's tension. However, this warning did not prompt the level of immediate action necessary to prevent the catastrophe.The shooting began roughly 30 minutes after Gray’s call, with school resource officers mistakenly detaining a student with a similar name instead of Colt. This error allowed Colt to carry out the attack, resulting in the deaths of two teachers and two students, and injuring nine others.Marcee Gray told ABC News she hadn’t spoken to her son since the shooting.“I would tell him that I love him – that me and Jesus will love him forever and ever,” she said. “And I would tell him that ‘it’s not your fault.’ It’s not his fault.”Colt Gray was arrested after surrendering to a school security officer and now faces multiple charges, including four counts of felony murder. His father, Colin Gray , is also charged with serious offenses including involuntary manslaughter and cruelty to children. Both are being held without bail and are scheduled to appear in court on December 4.The day’s series of missed warnings and the delayed response underscore a critical need for improved communication and safety measures in schools to prevent such tragedies.","Marcee Gray made an urgent call to the school around 9:50 am on the morning of the shooting, after receiving a distressing text from her son.

Harris denounces Trump’s policies as 'immoral'

Trump defends state-level regulation and IVF

Democratic nominee Kamala Harris sharply criticized Donald Trump ’s stance on abortion rights , saying, ""Trump should not be telling a woman what to do with her body.""As the much anticipated debate unfolded, Harris used the platform to emphasize her support for reinstating Roe v. Wade , which Trump’s Supreme Court appointees overturned. She condemned the Trump-backed abortion bans currently in effect in over 20 states, describing them as draconian measures that criminalize medical care and offer life sentences for providers.These bans, Harris argued, make no exceptions for rape or incest victims, effectively stripping survivors of their autonomy.“Now, in over 20 states, there are Trump abortion bans which make it criminal for a doctor or nurse to provide health care,” Harris stated. “In one state, it provides prison for life. Trump abortion bans that make no exception, even for rape and incest, which, understand what that means—a survivor of a crime of violation to their body does not have the right to make a decision about what happens to their body.”Harris denounced these measures as “immoral” and argued that “one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government and Donald Trump certainly should not be telling a woman what to do with her body.” She reiterated her commitment to sign legislation restoring Roe v. Wade if elected, contingent on Congressional approval.Trump, who has endorsed the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, has argued that abortion should be regulated at the state level. He insisted he would not sign a national abortion ban, despite Harris’s warnings about his “Project 2025,” which she claims would lead to such a ban.In a rebuttal, Trump emphasized his support for In vitro fertilisation (IVF), countering claims that he supports banning it. He noted his push for legislation in Alabama to support the procedure following legal uncertainties.As the debate continues, the clash over abortion rights highlights the deep divide between the candidates and underscores the high stakes of the upcoming election.","Democratic nominee Kamala Harris sharply criticized Donald Trump ’s stance on abortion rights.

Impact on Haitian communities

Context of haitian immigration in the US

Former President Donald Trump has ignited controversy with claims that Haitian immigrants in Springfield , Ohio, are abducting and eating pets. During a televised debate on Tuesday with Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump echoed inflammatory rhetoric that has sparked outrage and confusion.“There’s been talk that they’re eating the dogs. They’re eating the cats. They’re eating the pets of the people that live there,” Trump said, referring to the town of Springfield, which has been at the center of these unsubstantiated claims.Despite the lack of evidence, Trump’s comments are part of a broader pattern of using anti-immigrant rhetoric to fuel fear and controversy.Vice President Kamala Harris responded by labeling Trump’s remarks as “extreme” and laughed off his accusations. Debate moderators quickly highlighted that city officials have dismissed the claims as false.Springfield city manager Bryan Heck's office reiterated that there are no credible reports of pets being harmed by the immigrant community. “There have been no credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed,” Heck stated.The false narrative began on September 6 with a social media post that alleged Haitian immigrants in Springfield were involved in disturbing activities involving pets. The post, which included an image of a Black man carrying a Canada goose, was quickly shared and amplified by political figures including Ohio Senator JD Vance and other Republicans. Vance’s office acknowledged that the rumors might be false, but the misinformation had already spread widely.Hours before the debate, Trump further fueled the controversy by posting provocative images on his social media platform, including one of himself surrounded by cats and geese, and another featuring armed cats in MAGA hats.Ohio Governor Mike DeWine declined to directly address the allegations, instead deferring to local officials. However, DeWine voiced support for Haitian immigrants, emphasizing his family's charitable work in Haiti.In contrast, an unrelated incident in Canton, Ohio, has been erroneously linked to the Springfield rumors. Last month, Canton police charged Allexis Ferrell with animal cruelty after she was accused of torturing and killing a cat. Ferrell, however, is not Haitian and has a history of legal troubles unrelated to immigration.Advocates for Haitian immigrants, such as Guerline Jozef of the Haitian Bridge Alliance, have condemned the spread of false narratives, calling them dangerous and harmful. “We are always at the receiving end of all kinds of barbaric, inhumane narratives,” Jozef said. White House national security spokesman John Kirby echoed this concern, noting the potential for such misinformation to incite violence against innocent people.Springfield, with a population of around 60,000, has seen a rise in its Haitian community. Most Haitians in the area are legally residing under a federal program allowing temporary stay due to unsafe conditions in Haiti. The Biden administration recently extended temporary legal status to approximately 300,000 Haitians in the U.S. due to ongoing violence in their home country.","Former President Donald Trump ignited controversy with claims that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, are abducting and eating pets.

US presidential debate: Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have taken the stage at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia for their highly anticipated debate. This is the first time the two candidates have met in person.As the debate commenced, Harris walked over to Trump’s podium to extend her hand, and the two engaged in a brief handshake.With this symbolic gesture, the debate officially began, marking a significant moment in this election cycle.This debate comes months after President Joe Biden announced his withdrawal from the election on July 21 and endorsed Vice President Harris.Here's who said what-Kamala Harris, facing scrutiny from the White House regarding the economy, emphasized her upbringing as a ""middle class kid"" and expressed her commitment to fostering an ""opportunity economy."" She strongly denounced President Trump's policies, arguing that they would lead to increased financial burdens for the American people. “I believe in the ambition, the aspiration, the dreams of the American people,” she said. She touted her plans to build an “opportunity economy,” including her proposals to make housing more affordable and expand the child tax credit.Kamala Harris said their administration had to “clean up Donald Trump’s mess” after his four years in the White House.She accused Trump of leaving the US with “the worst unemployment since the great depression,” “the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War,” and “the worst public health epidemic in a century.”Meanwhile, former President Trump refuted Harris's assertion that he intends to impose a ""sales tax"" on everyday items, labeling her claim as an ""incorrect statement.""Trump clarified, ""She knows that we're doing tariffs on other countries. Other countries are going to finally, after 75 years, pay us back for all that we've done for the world.""He further elaborated, ""And the tariff will be substantial in some cases. I took in billions and billions of dollars, as you know, from China. In fact, they never took the tariff off because it was so much money.""Kamala Harris criticised Trump's stance on abortion rights, asserting that he should not dictate what a woman does with her body. She expressed her support for reinstating Roe v Wade, the landmark Supreme Court decision that had previously protected abortion rights nationwide.Harris highlighted the consequences of the Trump abortion bans, which have been implemented in more than 20 states. These bans criminalize healthcare providers, such as doctors and nurses, for offering abortion services. In one state, the penalty for providing such care can result in life imprisonment. Shockingly, these bans make no exceptions, even in cases of rape or incest.""Trump abortion bans that make no exception, even for rape and incest, which, understand what that means, a survivor of a crime of violation to their body does not have the right to make a decision about what happens to their body,"" Harris said.She further condemned the bans as immoral, stating that one does not need to compromise their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree that the government, and especially Donald Trump, should not have the authority to control a woman's bodily autonomy.""Next, that is immoral, and one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government and Donald Trump certainly should not be telling a woman what to do with her body,"" Harris asserted. She pledged to sign legislation that would restore the protections provided by Roe v Wade, should Congress approve such a measure.Trump has expressed his stance on abortion, stating in an April video on his Truth Social platform that ""states will determine by vote or legislation, or perhaps both, and whatever they decide must be the law of the land."" This position aligns with the recently updated Republican National Committee platform.Notably, the platform does not include any mention of a nationwide ban on abortion, a policy that certain social conservative factions had hoped to see incorporated. However, Trump has openly declared his opposition to such a ban at the federal level, instead favoring leaving the decision to individual states.Donald Trump called Kamala Harris a “Marxist” and said that her father was also a Marxist professor. It is pertinent to mention that he was a retired Stanford University economist.“If she ever got elected, she’d change it. And it will be the end of our country. She’s a Marxist; everybody knows she’s a Marxist. Her father is a Marxist professor in economics, and he taught her well,” Trump said.Donald Trump slammed Kamala Harris and Biden administration over illegal migration into the US and claimed that she is destroying the country. ""She is destroying this country. We will become Venezuela on steroids if she becomes president,"" Donald Trump said.""You see what's happening with towns throughout the United States. You look at Springfield, Ohio. You look at Aurora in Colorado, they are taking over the towns. They're taking over buildings. They're going in violently. These are the people that she and Biden led into our country, and they're destroying our country. They're dangerous. They're at the highest level of criminality. And we have to get them out,"" he said.Meanwhile, Harris has quickly started to try to counter Trump’s attacks on her immigration record during her campaign and outlined her policies.Donald Trump again claimed that pets were being stolen from their houses by Haitian immigrants who were consuming the pets.""In Springfield they are eating dogs, cats. They are eating the pets of the people who live there. We will end up being Venezuela on steroids,"" he said. However ABC news anchor corrected him saying that they reached out to the city manager of Springfield, Ohio and he denied all reports of pets being attacked.On being asked about being regretful about the January 6 riots, Trump said that he offered to give soldiers to then White House speaker Nancy Pelosi to fight against the rioters but she refused to accept it.""I have nothing to do with that other than that they asked me to make a speech. Nancy Pelosi is fully responsible for that.""Reacting on Trump's comments on Capitol attack, the vice president said, ""I was at the Capitol on January 6. The President of the US incited a violent mob to attract our nation's capital, to desecrate our nation's capital.""“On that day, 140 law enforcement officers were injured and some died,” she said. “And understand the former president has been indicted and impeached for exactly that reason. But this is not an isolated situation.”The former president Trump again claimed that the Israel will be gone under Kamala's administration. ""She hates Israel. She didn't even meet Netanyahu when he visited Congress. She also hates the Arab population. Look at what is happening in the middle east. This would have never happened if I were president.""Refuting his claims, the vice president said, ""That's absolutely not true. I have my entire career and life supported Israel and the Israeli people.""She also said that Israel “has the right to defend itself,” adding “we would” if the United States were attacked. The vice president went on to advocate for a “two-state solution.”On being asked whether he wanted Ukraine to win the war against Russia, Trump responded, “I want the war to stop and want to save lives,” declining to take sides between Russia and Ukraine. Meanwhile, the vice president claimed that if Trump become the president, Russian President Vladimir Putin will be sitting in Ukraine.""I think why Donald Trump says this war would be over in 24 hours because he would give it up. If Trump were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now,"" Kamala said.""Putin would be sitting in Kyiv with his eyes on the rest of Europe, starting with Poland,"" Harris said, noting ""how quickly you would give up for the sake of favor and what you think is a friendship with what is known to be a dictator who would eat you for lunch.""Harris said it was an example of why America's NATO allies were thankful he was no longer in office, as she and Biden have sent tens of billions of dollars to help Kyiv fend off Russia's invasion.Trump claimed that the vice president has a plan to confiscate everybody's gun. Refuting the claims, Harris said, ""Tim Walz and I are both gun owners. We're not taking anybody's guns away so stop with the continuous lying about this stuff.""Racial divideOne of the most talked about Harris was her ethnicity, race. Earlier, in several rallies, Trump called upon Harris for being black and Asian woman.Answering to question why he had publicly questioned Harris’ dual heritage as a Black and South Asian woman, Trump said, “I don’t care what she is ... I read that she was Black. Then I read that she was not Black.”Asked to respond, Harris accused Trump of using race to divide Americans throughout his career. She cited how he and his father turned away Black renters in the 1970s and how Trump led the public outcry against five young Black and Latino men who were wrongly convicted of assaulting a jogger in New York City's Central Park in 1989.More recently, he openly questioned whether President Barack Obama was a US citizen, Harris noted.""I think it's a tragedy that we have someone who wants to be president who has, consistently, over the course of his career, attempted to use race to divide the American people,"" she said.Harris emphasised that the American people deserve better than a leader who persistently encourages citizens to point fingers at one another. ""I think the American people want better than that,"" Harris added. ""We don't want a leader who is constantly trying to have Americans point their fingers at each other.""In response to the criticism, Trump shifted the focus back to economic matters and attempted to associate Biden's economic policies with Harris, suggesting that she was trying to distance herself from Biden. ""She's trying to get away from Biden,"" he said.Seizing the opportunity presented by the attack, Harris positioned herself as a transformative leader for the nation, emphasizing her unique identity and leadership style. ""Clearly, I am not Joe Biden, and certainly not Donald Trump,"" Harris said, ""and what I do offer is a new generation of leadership for our country.""","Kamala Harris said their administration had to “clean up Donald Trump’s mess” after his four years in the White House. Trump refuted Harris's assertion that he intends to impose a ""sales tax"" on everyday items, labeling her claim as an ""incorrect statement""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113242615,imgsize-30612,width-400,resizemode-4/113242615.jpg"

The complaint accuses Alvarado-Gil of forcing her former chief of staff, Chad Condit , into performing sexually explicit acts that allegedly led to severe injuries.Marie Alvarado-Gil, born on December 24, 1973, is a prominent American educator and politician.Representing California's 4th State Senate district, she has been a notable figure in California politics since her election to the California State Senate in 2022. Initially a member of the Democratic Party , Alvarado-Gil made headlines with her switch to the Republican Party on August 8, 2024.Alvarado-Gil is known for her fiscal conservatism, frequently aligning with Republicans on labor issues while maintaining progressive stances on social issues. Her career and policy positions reflect a complex blend of ideologies that have both drawn support and sparked controversy.Alvarado-Gil has faced significant health challenges, including a diagnosis of cervical cancer and metastatic thyroid cancer in 2018. She successfully overcame these health battles by 2019. Additionally, she is the mother of two children with special needs, which has profoundly influenced her perspectives on various issues.The 39-page complaint detailed a “sex-based quid pro quo relationship,” with Condit claiming he was coerced into sexual acts during work-related travel to retain his job, according to the suit filed in Sacramento Superior Court, as reported by Sky News.The lawsuit allegeed that during one particularly harrowing encounter, Condit was forced to perform oral sex on Alvarado-Gil in a car, leading to a debilitating back injury. Court documents reveal that Condit suffered three herniated discs and a collapsed hip due to the physical strain of the act.“This was a sex-based quid pro quo relationship of unwelcome advances and sexual behaviors coupled with punishment and flexing of power,” the lawsuit stated. Condit also claims that resistance to Alvarado-Gil’s advances led to retaliation, including a disciplinary letter accusing him of inappropriate behavior and his eventual firing in December.According to the complaint, Condit met Alvarado-Gil in 2022 after losing a primary election for the California assembly. Alvarado-Gil, having been elected as state senator that year, hired Condit as her chief of staff. The lawsuit alleges that Alvarado-Gil began “grooming” Condit with intimate details about her personal life and compared him to his father, former Democratic Representative Gary Condit, who was involved in a high-profile scandal in the early 2000s, reported the Sky News.The complaint further alleges that Alvarado-Gil exerted increasing control over Condit by involving him in personal errands, such as transporting her children and caring for her dog. “This growing control and exercise of power by [Alvarado-Gil] further conditioned [Condit] into an unequal and subservient position,” the lawsuit reads. The complaint describes how Alvarado-Gil allegedly established a dominant-submissive relationship, culminating in sexual advances during a trip to Inyo County.Alvarado-Gil’s recent defection from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party has stirred additional controversy. She criticized the Democratic Party as “unrecognizable” from what she once knew, and in the lawsuit, she is portrayed as an “erratic” and “controlling” boss who exploited her position of power.Her attorney, Ognian Gavrilov, has strongly denied the allegations, calling them “fabricated” and “financially motivated.” Gavrilov argues that the claims are a desperate attempt by a disgruntled former employee to secure a financial payout.","California State Senator Marie Alvarado-Gil is facing serious allegations in a new lawsuit.

Giant plumes of smoke dot Southern California skies as crews fight several major wildfires,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/giant-plumes-of-smoke-dot-southern-california-skies-as-crews-fight-several-major-wildfires/articleshow/113242823.cms,"TRABUCO CANYON: Apocalyptic-looking plumes of smoke dotted skies over parts of Southern California on Tuesday as firefighters continued to battle at least three major wildfires that erupted amid a blistering heat wave and were threatening tens of thousands of homes and buildings.In Orange County, firefighters used bulldozers, helicopters and planes to control a rapidly spreading blaze that started Monday and spread to about 3 square miles (8 square kilometers) in only a few hours.The blaze was ignited by a spark from heavy equipment being used by public workers, officials said.By Tuesday, it had charred more than 14 square miles (36 square kilometers) and was heading over mountainous terrain into neighboring Riverside County with no containment, said Orange County Fire Authority Capt. Steve Concialdi. It burned some communications towers on top of a peak, though so far officials said they did not have reports of the damage disrupting police or fire communication signals in the area.Two firefighters who suffered heat-related injuries and a resident who suffered from smoke inhalation were treated at a hospital and released.Sherri Fankhauser, her husband and her daughter set up lawn chairs and were watching helicopters make water drops on a flaming hillside a few hundred yards away from their Trabuco Canyon home on Tuesday.They didn't evacuate even though their street had been under a mandatory evacuation order since Monday. A neighbor did help Fankhauser's 89-year-old mother-in-law evacuate, Fankhauser said. The flames died down last night but flared up again in the morning.""You can see fire coming over the ridge now,"" Fankhauser said Tuesday afternoon. ""It's getting a little scarier now.""She said she trusted the crews would get things under control and that firefighters were keeping them informed.Meanwhile, in the San Bernardino National Forest , about 65 miles (105 kilometers) east of Los Angeles, some 65,600 homes and buildings were under threat, including those under mandatory evacuations and those under evacuation warnings, nearly double the number from the previous day.Residents along the southern edge of Big Bear Lake were told to leave the area Tuesday night, according to the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department. It's unclear how many people were affected in the area, which is a popular destination for anglers, bikers and hikers.The blaze had charred about 44 square miles (114 square kilometers) of grass and brush and blanketed the area with a thick cloud of dark smoke Tuesday. The acrid air prompted several districts in the area to close schools through the end of the week because of safety concerns. Three firefighters have been injured since the blaze was reported Thursday, state fire managers said.The fire was 14% contained and was affecting small mountain towns where Southern California residents ski in the winter and mountain bike in the summer.Other major fires were burning across the West, including in Idaho, Oregon and Nevada, where about 20,000 people had to flee a blaze outside Reno.Firefighters hope to gain the upper hand as cooler weather moves into California later in the week.An excessive heat warning issued for the Los Angeles area will expire Tuesday night.Another blaze in Southern California's Angeles National Forest, north of the city of Glendora , in Los Angeles County, grew to more than 4 square miles (12 square kilometers) and wasn't contained at all as of Tuesday.The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department ordered visitors at a campground and residents of an adjacent river community to evacuate, the US Forest Service said.In Northern California, a fire measuring less than a square mile (2.6 square kilometers) that started Sunday burned at least 30 homes and commercial buildings and destroyed 40 to 50 vehicles in Clearlake City, 110 miles (117 kilometers) north of San Francisco, officials said. Roughly 4,000 people were forced to evacuate by the so-called Boyles Fire, which was about 40% contained Monday afternoon.In Nevada, the uncontained Davis Fire burning about 20 miles (32.2 kilometers) outside Reno grew to about 10 square miles (26 square kilometers) after igniting Sunday. It originated in the Davis Creek Regional Park in the Washoe Valley and was burning in heavy timber and brush, firefighters said.An emergency declaration issued for Washoe County by Gov. Joe Lombardo on Sunday noted that about 20,000 people were evacuated from neighborhoods, businesses, parks and campgrounds. Parts of south Reno remained under the evacuation notice on Monday and some homes, businesses and traffic signals in the area were without power.In Idaho, fire managers were prepared for an active day, with warm, dry and windy conditions and even more challenges on Tuesday. The Boulder and the Lava Fires are burning in western Idaho.In central Oregon, several blazes prompted evacuation warnings, including one west of Mount Bachelor in the Deschutes National Forest.","In Orange County, firefighters use bulldozers, helicopters and planes to control a rapidly spreading blaze that started Monday.

A video of California Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell reacting to viral memes of Donald Trump with cats and ducks has taken the internet by storm.

Although the theory has been debunked by local police, the memes have continued to spread, projecting Trump as a protector of animals.In the viral clip, Swalwell is seen with one of the memes, posted by Republican House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan , displayed behind him.Clearly exasperated, Swalwell exclaims, ""What in the hell is this?"" He then addressed Jordan directly, saying, ""The chairman tweets to protect our ducks and kittens in Ohio because he’s gone down some crazy rabbit hole… My god, are you okay, Mr. Chairman?""The conspiracy theory that triggered the memes had gained traction on social media but was swiftly debunked by police in Springfield, Ohio. They confirmed that there were no reports of immigrants abducting or eating pets, calling the viral claims completely false.Swalwell didn’t hold back in his critique of Jordan's recent social media activity. ""Last year, you promoted Kanye West while he was calling for genocide against the Jews, and now you're tweeting this nonsense,"" he added. ""I hope you're okay. I don’t know if the aliens eating your ducks are in the room with us right now, but Mr. Chairman, this is a serious issue.""Ohio Senator and Republican Vice Presidential candidate JD Vance also weighed in, asking what Vice President Kamala Harris , whom he dubbed ""the border czar,"" was doing about the alleged pet abductions.

Debate impact versus election reality

The anticipation for the first presidential debate between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday night is sky-high, with betting markets already identifying Harris as the likely winner of the showdown.According to the Fox News , traders on Polymarket , a popular prediction platform, gave Harris a 75% chance of dominating the debate, compared to Trump’s 25%.Similarly, BetUS favored Harris with a 68.75% chance of success, leaving Trump trailing with odds of 39.22%.While Harris is predicted to take the upper hand in the debate, there’s a twist—Trump is still favored to win the overall election. According to BetUS, Trump has a 54.55% implied probability of securing victory in the presidential race, compared to Harris' 52.38%. Polymarket echoes this sentiment, giving Trump a 52% chance of winning the election, with Harris at 45%.These forecasts create an intriguing paradox: The vice president is poised to win the debate but faces an uphill battle in the broader race. Real Clear Politics ’ average of six betting markets shows Trump leading Harris with a 51.7% chance of clinching the presidency, compared to her 46.7%. However, PredictIt offers a slightly different take, giving Harris a 53% chance of winning the election and Trump a 52% chance.Rutgers University’s Harry Crane, an expert on prediction markets, explained the apparent disconnect. He pointed out that platforms like Polymarket often rely on polling data from Ipsos/538, which tend to lean more liberal, favoring Harris in debates. However, Crane suggested debates may not drastically sway election outcomes unless they are particularly one-sided.“There are two questions going on here,” Crane said. “One is, how much do the debates matter? The other is, does the poll about who won the debate actually reflect who won the debate?”While Tuesday night’s debate may set the tone for the coming weeks, the broader battle for the presidency remains a far more unpredictable affair.","Traders on Polymarket gave Harris a 75% chance of dominating the debate, compared to Trump’s 25%.

Imran’s flock detained after protest for his release,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imrans-flock-detained-after-protest-for-his-release/articleshow/113240529.cms,"ISLAMABAD

:

Pakistani police have detained several leaders and lawmakers of Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) from parliament’s compound, days after the party held a rally and served a two-week ultimatum for the release of the jailed former PM. The detentions followed alleged violation of norms during the rally.In a separate development, Ali Amin Gandapur , chief minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) from Imran’s PTI, went missing from Islamabad for eight hours Monday and emerged in his provincial capital Peshawar Tuesday.Sources revealed Gandapur was in the custody of an intelligence agency and added that the CM of the northwestern province was quizzed for hours before his release early Tuesday.Gandapur came under fire for a tirade against the military during PTI’s protest-cum-power show Sunday in Islamabad’s suburbs. “Fix your institution, fix your generals, fix yourself. If the founder of PTI (Imran) is not legally released within one to two weeks, we will have him freed ourselves,” the CM vowed.While several PTI lawmakers apologised for Gandapur’s remarks, Imran defended him, saying he had merely expressed the nation’s sentiments. “Party members who have apologised for Gandapur’s remarks are weak and cowards. They should not remain in PTI,” Imran was quoted as saying at his prison in Rawalpindi.Last week, the federal govt passed a law to “regulate” public gatherings in Islamabad. It set three-year jail terms for participants of “illegal” assemblies, with 10 years for repeat offenders. The Islamabad administration had allowed PTI’s Sunday’s rally from 4pm till 7pm, but the gathering went on until 11pm. “They were arrested due to violation of the new law,” Islamabad police spokespersonTaqi Jawad said, referring to PTI arrests, including that of chairman Gohar Khan .Since his removal from power in April 2022, Imran and his PTI have waged an unprecedented campaign of defiance against the military.The PTI says it has faced a months-long crackdown since protesters allegedly linked to the party attacked and damaged govt and military installations on May 9, 2023, after Khan’s brief arrest that day in a land graft case. Hundreds of PTI arrests followed. Many remain behind bars. The military, which says Imran and his party were behind the attacks, has initiated army court trials of at least 103 people accused of involvement in the violence.In Feb this year, Imran and PTI were barred from the national election, which was alleged to have been rigged. Candidates aligned with the party, forced to contest independently, still won most seats in parliament but not enough to form the govt. PTI alleged that its mandate was “stolen” by PM Shebaz Sharif’s governing coalition with the all-powerful military’s backing.

Imran Khan’s party leaders arrested in Pakistan after violent protests,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imran-khans-party-leaders-arrested-in-pakistan-after-violent-protests/articleshow/113205117.cms,"What does the new law say

Several top leaders of Imran Khan ’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party were arrested on Monday in Islamabad. The arrests included barrister Gohar Khan, Sher Afzal Marwat, and advocate Shoaib Shaheen, following a violent clash between PTI supporters and police during a protest demanding Khan's release. The arrests have been widely condemned by PTI as politically motivated.PTI has vehemently opposed the arrests, calling them a ""direct attack on democracy."" In posts on X (formerly Twitter), the party criticised the government's actions, arguing that the arrests are an attempt to suppress their movement.PTI leader Zulfi Bukhari condemned the detentions as ""illegal"" and said, ""These arrests won’t change anything; they will only increase public anger against this puppet government.""Omar Ayub Khan, another senior PTI figure, also denounced the arrests and revealed that police had been forming teams to apprehend him and other top PTI members, including Zartaj Gul Wazir . ""This fascist regime has gone completely mad... We will continue raising our voices for our leader, PM Imran Khan ,"" he wrote on X.Despite the crackdown, many PTI lawmakers remained inside Parliament House to avoid arrest, and more detentions are expected in the coming days. The Islamabad high court bar association has also condemned the arrests, demanding the release of Marwat and Shaheen, both respected members of the legal community.The arrests occur amidst growing political tension in Pakistan. Imran Khan, who has been imprisoned since 2022 on corruption charges, remains a central figure in the country's political landscape. His supporters’ continued protests and the government’s aggressive response have only heightened the political discord.The arrests were made under the newly enacted Peaceful Assembly and Public Order Bill, 2024. This legislation, which came into effect just before the PTI rally, empowers authorities to regulate and ban public gatherings in Islamabad. Under this law, the district magistrate can disband any assembly deemed likely to disturb public peace, with penalties including up to three years in prison or fines. Repeat offenders face even harsher penalties, potentially extending to 10 years of imprisonment.

At least 16 more Taliban members were wounded in the clash, the second since last week along one of the 18 border crossings linking Pakistan's Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces with Afghanistan in the southwest and northwest.Confirmation of the Taliban casualties by Pakistan's state-owned media contrasted with a statement by Afghanistan that unprovoked firing and shelling from across the border caused civilian deaths and displacement.Pakistan said the fighting started after the Taliban attempted to illegally set up a checkpoint near the border. Light and heavy weapons were used by both sides, officials said.“Afghan Taliban opened unprovoked firing with heavy weapons yesterday from inside Afghanistan, targeting Pakistani checkpoints,"" Radio Pakistan reported Monday. ""Pakistani security forces responded effectively and killed eight Afghan Taliban, including commanders Khalil and Jan Muhammad .""Scores of families along the Durand Line, the 2,640km border between Afghanistan and Pakistan, have fled their homes due to repeated clashes between the Islamic Emirate forces and the Pakistani military.""We have two casualties, one of them a woman, and about 11 wounded,"" Thamin Khan , a resident of Zazi Maidan district, was quoted as saying by official Afghan media.""Bullets struck our homes and it is unclear what will happen next. This situation has caused problems for us, forcing many to migrate,"" Mohibullah, another resident of the conflict zone, said.Videos circulating on social media showed heavy gunfire in the area.Khost's deputy governor directed residents and the forces stationed along the Durand Line to respond appropriately to any attacks, while the Afghan deputy minister for borders and tribal affairs said in Kabul that the latest dispute had been resolved. Pakistan military's media wing, Inter-Services Public Relations, hadn't responded to the claim till late Monday.Clashes between Afghan Taliban and Pakistani forces have occurred frequently along the Durand Line, a disputed border, in recent years, often resulting in casualties on both sides.Of the 18 border crossings, Chaman and Torkham are the busiest. Clashes often lead to closure of these border crossings, disrupting trade and movement of people. The Torkham border has been shut for the past three days after Afghan Taliban announced they were investigating reports of Pakistani fighter jets violating Afghan airspace to patrol Nangarhar and Kunar provinces.Pakistani officials have accused the Afghan Taliban of sheltering the banned militant group Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan. Afghan authorities maintain that such security challenges are an internal issue for Islamabad.",Two Taliban commanders were among eight fighters killed in a fresh confrontation with Pakistani forces.

How costly is a cup of tea in Kabul? Ask Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/how-costly-is-a-cup-of-tea-in-kabul-ask-pakistan-terrorism-ttp-imran-khan-taliban-afghanistan/articleshow/113190988.cms,"'Missteps by Imran Khan govt'



Strategy backfires

NEW DELHI: In an unusual critique of the military establishment, Pakistan 's deputy prime minister Ishaq Dar has connected a visit by a ""three-star general to Kabul for tea in 2021"" to the recent uptick in terrorism throughout the country.In September 2021, as the Taliban regained control of Afghanistan after the sudden pullout of US troops in August, then ISI chief general Faiz Hameed had visited Kabul and was photographed enjoying tea, during which he assured a journalist that ""everything will be fine"" -- a pivotal point in Pakistan's military and intelligence strategy towards Afghanistan.""The country is paying a price for that cup of tea in Afghanistan,"" said Dar, without naming Hameed.The deputy PM further said that the decision by the general to release some militants was the reason behind increased attacks across Pakistan. ""Those released at that time are masterminding terrorism in Balochistan today,"" he said, indicating there is a widely held belief that the decisions made by military leaders during this period were not only misguided but have also contributed to the current instability in Pakistan.Dar, who also holds the foreign affairs portfolio, made the rem­a­rks during a press conference at the Pakistan High Commi­ss­i­on in London.Stating that the 2021 visit to Kabul could not have happened without the permission of former PM Imran Khan, Dar hit out at the ""mistakes"" made by the ousted leader, particularly in relation to economic and security decisions, and linked the former administration's ""missteps"" to the current rise in terrorism and economic challenges.""I find it difficult to accept that he [Hameed] could have gone without the permission of the prime minister [Imran Khan]. We are working with the security establishment on issues today, these things are not possible without the PM's approval,"" said Dar.After criticising military officials of the ""past"", Dar was quick to praise the curr­ent military establishm­ent.""They cannot be praised en­o­ugh as its members are very professional. Their agenda is Pakistan, as is ours. This is a very good omen. They are not interested in who comes in government or opposition,"" he said.The Taliban's rise to power was initially seen by some in Pakistan as a potential boon, with expectations that the group would help curb the activities of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group that has long posed a threat to the Pakistani state.However, the reality has proven to be quite different, with the TTP intensifying its attacks since the Taliban's takeover, undermining the very stability that Pakistan hoped to achieve through its support of the Taliban.The situation in Balochistan is particularly alarming. The province has witnessed a significant uptick in violence, with attacks attributed to both the TTP and other militant groups.The Pakistani military's response has included increased operations against these groups, but the effectiveness of these measures remains in question. Dar's comments suggest a recognition that past decisions, particularly those made by military leaders like Hameed, have directly contributed to the current security crisis.","Pakistan's deputy prime minister Ishaq Dar has connected a visit by a ""three- star general to Kabul for tea in 2021"" to the recent uptick in terrorism.

Imran Khan's party stage rally in Islamabad; demand his immediate release,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imran-khans-party-stage-rally-in-islamabad-demand-his-immediate-release/articleshow/113173655.cms,"Jailed former premier Imran Khan 's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf on Sunday held a power show, demanding his immediate release while slamming the government for its crackdown on the party as police fired tear gas to disperse the crowd. The rally - postponed twice in the last two months - was held near Sangjani Cattle Market in the suburbs of Islamabad after the capital administration issued a no-objection certificate (NOC).Thousands of PTI supporters attended the rally, proving that the party's power base was intact despite several hurdles it faced, including the incarceration of its 71-year-old founder.Khan was arrested on August 5 last year after his conviction in the Toshakhana corruption case filed by the Election Commission of Pakistan. Since then, he has been in jail in different cases. On Sunday, Khan completed 400 days in prison.The rally was scheduled to end at 7 pm (local time) as per the NOC. As soon as the deadline ended, the district administration directed the police to take action against the rally-goers for not complying with the NOC.The authorities stated that the organisers violated the rules and regulations by not concluding the gathering before the deadline.In response to the crackdown, PTI workers began pelting stones at police, injuring many security personnel, including Senior Superintendent of Police Shoaib Khan .""Strong turnout for PTI rally despite the state's tactics to limit numbers through roadblocks and containers, and despite the risk of violent crackdowns and arrests. Its size and popularity ensure its mobilization capabilities remain intact despite relentless attempts to curb it,"" Micheal Kugleman, a South Asian expert, said in a post on X.Several PTI leaders addressed the gathering, demanding Khan's immediate release. PTI leader in the National Assembly Omar Ayub Khan said the party would not sit until Khan was released.""We are soldiers of Imran Khan and will not sit until he is set free,"" he said, adding that soon Khan would be with his supporters.He condemned physical hurdles put on roads to restrict the movement of participants and also announced that the PTI would now hold rallies across the country.It was the first major rally by the PTI in Islamabad since the February 8 elections. The party wants to exert pressure on the government to release Khan, who languishes in jail despite the courts either acquitting him or giving him bail in all cases he was convicted.PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan said the government turned the city into a cage, but still thousands of people attended the rally. ""It shows that Imran Khan is a reality, and you will have to accept it...Imran Khan is a leader and will always be a leader,"" he said.He told the participants that Khan was their only leader who never surrendered and would never surrender. He warned that the PTI would not accept new cases against Khan.Gohar said that the PTI planned this rally for six months and followed Khan's instructions to hold the rally after getting permission from the government. He criticised the government for introducing a new law to restrict political activities.Slogans were raised during the rally demanding Khan's release from jail.He ended his speech with the promise that ""Imran Khan will be soon out of jail and with his people"".The key speech was made by Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur who came from Peshawar, leading a large number of Khan's supporters from the province.In his emotional address, he vowed to continue the struggle for the rights of people. He said those who put Khan in jail were being humiliated while ""Khan is winning in jail"".He said that the government gave permission for the rally and blocked all roads leading to the venue of the rally. ""Imran Khan you have won while all others lost,"" he said, vowing to go to any length for Khan.He also announced to hold the next rally in Lahore, irrespective of whether the government gives permission or not.Gandapur also rejected that Khan would be tried under army law, saying no one could do it.Khan has repeatedly shown a willingness to hold talks with the establishment while refusing to sit with the government. So far, all his tactics have failed to get any relief. Mass protest is an option, but his party has been facing pressure to avoid it.Today's rally was a test for both the government and the PTI as it will help them gauge the ground power swell for Khan and fine-tune their policies and tactics in the coming days.Sources told PTI that the Islamabad administration put security on high alert this morning and blocked off multiple arteries leading to the capital city. Hospitals were put on alert by the administration. The Metro bus services were stopped in the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi.Addressing the rally, former minister Hammad Azhar said the hindrance created by the rulers showed that they were afraid of Khan and his supporters.He pointed out that most of the party's Punjab leadership is in jail, paying tribute to incarcerated leaders, including Shah Mahmood Qureshi and Umar Sarfraz Cheema .Another leader Sher Afzal Marwat said they will soon hold rallies in Punjab for Khan's release and the supremacy of law and the Constitution.""We will enter Punjab with 50,000 people from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa within a week,"" he said, adding that they will even set off on foot and face the tear gas.Additional forces have been summoned to the location where the clash between the police and party workers originally started.Meanwhile, President Asif Ali Zardari signed into law the Public Order and Peaceful Assembly Bill 2024 hours before the planned rally, instituting strict measures for unauthorised gatherings.The new law introduces penalties for holding gatherings without permission in Islamabad, with violators facing up to three years in prison and fines. The repeat offenders could be sentenced to up to 10 years in jail.","Thousands of PTI supporters attended the rally, proving that the party's power base was intact.

IG Islamabad and tout government should STOP playing with people's lives. This is highly disgusting and shameful, the people sent a huge message today!"" the party added.The rally, which had faced multiple delays due to revoked permissions, finally commenced on the outskirts of Islamabad on Sunday. Despite being denied permission several times earlier, the PTI brought together supporters from across the province, as reported by Dawn.Addressing the rally, senior PTI leader Hammad Azhar said that the gathering was a stand for the rule of law and the supremacy of the Constitution in Pakistan. ""We will, God willing, secure Imran Khan's release,"" Azhar said, adding that no obstacle would deter their cause.The rally had originally been scheduled for July, then postponed to August, before being further delayed due to security concerns cited by authorities. PTI has been pushing for Imran Khan’s release since his imprisonment in August.Although Khan’s conviction in the Iddat case was recently overturned, his release was blocked by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), which arrested him in connection with a new Toshakhana case shortly after. His previous Toshakhana sentences were suspended, and he was also acquitted in the cipher case by the Islamabad high court.PTI has been trying to secure permission for a public meeting in Islamabad for several months, but the district administration has repeatedly denied their requests, citing security risks. The party even approached the Islamabad High Court (IHC) in March for approval.In July, PTI announced another protest , but the district administration revoked their non-objection certificate (NOC) at the last moment, delaying the rally until September 8. Despite preparations for the event, the capital police blocked major entry points to the city, citing intelligence reports of a ""medium-level"" terrorism threat linked to the gathering.Senior PTI leader Asad Qaiser decried the government’s preventive measures, including the placement of containers and police blockades. ""It is unfortunate that this fascist government with a stolen mandate is creating such a hostile environment,"" Qaiser said in a video message posted on X. ""They approved the NOC and the court has permitted the rally, but Rawalpindi has been closed off.""PTI Punjab spokesperson Shaukat Basra also claimed that the police in Punjab had received ""unconstitutional"" orders to block workers from joining the rally.","The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) has accused the police of opening fire on its supporters during a rally in Islamabad on Sunday.

"Former Pakistan PM Imran Khan likely to face military trial, says defence minister Khawaja Asif",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/former-pakistan-pm-imran-khan-likely-to-face-military-trial-says-defence-minister-khawaja-asif/articleshow/113166679.cms,"Pakistan's defence minister , Khawaja Asif , has indicated that former Prime Minister Imran Khan will likely face a military trial as legal challenges continue to mount against him. Speaking to a private news channel Geo News, Asif said, ""Evidence against the founder of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) points towards military trial.""Imran Khan has been embroiled in numerous legal cases, including one related to the May 9 riots, where military installations were attacked.Fearing prosecution in a military court, Khan filed a petition in the Islamabad High Court (IHC) seeking to halt the trial. However, the IHC raised concerns about the petition's validity, citing the absence of a specific first information report (FIR) or supporting documentation.Khan's petition comes amid ongoing legal debates. In December 2023, Pakistan's Supreme Court , in a 5:1 majority ruling, suspended an earlier decision that declared civilians' military trials unlawful. This ruling, tied to the May 9 riots, has left the final decision on military trials pending the court's verdict on intra-court appeals filed by the federal and provincial governments and the defence ministry.Asif also commented on former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Lieutenant General (retd) Faiz Hamid, who he claimed aspired to become Pakistan's army chief. Asif alleged that Faiz had reached out to the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) seeking support for his bid, offering loyalty in exchange. Faiz, currently facing allegations of land grabbing, was arrested by the army in August.""General (retd) Faiz wanted to become army chief, his name was on the list. He contacted the PML-N leadership in this regard and assured of his loyalty against support for his bid for army chief,"" said Asif.He further noted that Faiz's frustrations grew after the appointment of the current army chief. Asif suggested that Faiz may now try to deflect blame onto others, adding, ""He [Faiz] might say that even if he was part of the conspiracy then the objectives [of conspiracy] were of the PTI founder's and not his.""Meanwhile, Imran Khan, who is currently detained in Adiala Jail, has warned of protests if the government undermines the judiciary's independence. In a message shared on social media, Khan said, ""Pakistan's army belongs to everyone – to the whole nation – not just one political party or the army chief. They robbed the election and are now not allowing the judiciary to function independently.""Khan also criticised the treatment of Pakistan's current leadership in prison, claiming they enjoyed preferential conditions compared to him. ""I have not spent a single day at the prison hospital,"" he said, contrasting his treatment with that of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and others, who, according to him, had access to air-conditioned rooms with en-suite bathrooms during their time in custody.","Khawaja Asif says evidence against Imran Khan points towards military trial. Khan has been embroiled in numerous legal cases, including one related to the May 9 riots.
