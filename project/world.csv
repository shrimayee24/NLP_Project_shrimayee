But as govt is going for compulsory registration, it cannot be done by private people and has to be done by govt officials,"" the CM told the assembly.""Muslim marriages already registered by qazis, and those married in absence of qazis in the last six months (after qazis became irrelevant following an ordinance) will be valid for registration, but intended marriages have to be registered compulsorily,"" he added.Earlier, the House passed the Assam Repealing Bill, 2024, which abolished the colonial-era Assam Moslem Marriages and Divorces Registration Act, 1935.Assam Repealing Bill is part of govt's effort to prevent child marriage and eliminate ""Qazi"" system in Muslim marriage registration. Sarma said qazis, who are not govt officials, cannot be authorised to register marriages. The registration will instead be done by govt-appointed officials for a symbolic fee of Re 1, with special sub-registrars appointed for the purpose.With this, Sarma vowed to end child marriage in Assam by 2026. Under the new law, girls must be at least 18 years old and boys 21 years of age on date of solemnising a marriage.","Assam Repealing Bill is part of govt's effort to prevent child marriage and eliminate ""Qazi"" system in Muslim marriage registration.

"Wolf Attack in UP: 'Catch us if you can': After 7 kills, wolves dare forest officials in UP",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/catch-us-if-you-can-killer-wolves-dare-forest-officials-in-up/articleshow/112883459.cms,"Drone shots of wolves hiding in cane field in Bahraich village

BAHRAICH: Wolves are athletic and sly, and therefore catching them is no mean task. This is the reason that three killer wolves, which have unleashed terror in Sisiya village of UP's Bahraich, have remained elusive despite 25 teams of the forest department hunting for them in a non-stop search operation .The trio has already slayed seven villagers, including six children, and injured 22 persons in the past 45 days.A two-member TOI team joined the chase with the forest teams which are equipped with night-vision drones, nets, and tranquiliser guns in one of the biggest hunting operations in the state in recent years. CM Yogi Adityanath dispatched forest minister Arun Kumar Saxena to ground zero on Wednesday for an on-the spot report of the operation.After an unsuccessful non-stop 48-hour combing, the teams finally had a glimmer of hope around 9.30am on Wednesday when drones located the lethal trio in the sugarcane fields of Sisiya village near the house of one Holi Yadav.One wolf was seen limping as its left foot was injured, said a forest official.""We are approaching with caution this time. Wolves are very sly and they managed to escape when we came close to catching them in the previous two attempts. This time we have laid a trap with a goat as bait. A tranquiliser team is ready once we get the breakthrough,"" said divisional forest officer Akashdeep Badhawan who is heading the task force team.We have spread elephant dung and urine in the lanes of villages to deter the wolves. When set aflame, the dung produces an odour that mimics the presence of elephants which are known to repel predators like wolves. The idea is to create the illu sion of elephants nearby,” added Badhawan.The forest teams, clad in protective gear which have now got dyed in mud given the continuous search, are working tirelessly to lay traps and establish a human cordon around the area.As night falls and the hunt continues, the tension is palpable. The forest teams remain vigilant, their eyes scanning the darkness for any sign of the predators.Meanwhile, villagers are also hoping for a divine intervention to ward off the evil and most of them are busy chanting ‘Hanuman Chalisa’. Holi Yadav, 54, whose house is near the sugarcane field where the wolves are hiding, believes prayers and chants will drive away the wolves. “I was born in this village but never saw such an attack. Children have been told not to venture out and villagers are keeping their homes locked even in the afternoon,” said Yadav.Holi’s neighbour Babu Ram said chanting Hanuman Chalisa will ward off the omen.","Three killer wolves have unleashed terror in Sisiya village of UP's Bahraich. 25 teams of the forest department are hunting for them in a non-stop search operation.

'Malicious disinformation campaign': Cornered Mamata hits back as BJP mounts pressure over Kolkata rape-murder case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/malicious-disinformation-campaign-cornered-mamata-hits-back-as-bjp-mounts-pressure-over-kolkata-rape-murder-case/articleshow/112903620.cms,"West Bengal Congress holds protest

'Country's outrage not just about Kolkata incident'

NEW DELHI: Mamata Banerjee , who has weathered several storms in her long political career, finds herself cornered and isolated over the brutal rape and murder of a trainee doctor in Kolkata's R G Kar Hospital.While the BJP has been mounting relentless pressure on the West Bengal chief minister , her allies from the opposition INDIA bloc have been divided in their response. The Bengal unit of the Congress and the Left have taken to the streets against the Trinamool government even as other INDIA bloc partners have been cautious in their support for the embattled Trinamool chief.Mamata, who had yesterday unleashed a scathing attack at the BJP over the ongoing protests and had even targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi, seemed to have gone on the defensive today as the saffron party accused her of threatening the striking doctors.Addressing a rally organised by the Trinamool Congress Chhatra Parishad, the West Bengal chief minister had on Wednesday urged the agitating junior doctors of Bengal to urgently consider returning to duty and said she doesn't want to lodge FIRs against the striking doctors in consideration of their future careers.Agitating doctors interpreted the chief minister's remark as a ""veiled threat"" and rejected her appeal to join work.Targeted by BJP over her remarks, Mamata asserted that she did not threaten junior doctors at state-run hospitals, who have been continuing cease-work for 21 days now. She said accusations that have come from certain quarters of her threatening the agitating junior doctors are ""completely false"" and part of a “malicious disinformation campaign”.""Let me most emphatically clarify that I have not uttered a single word against the (medical etc.) students or their movements. I totally support their movement. Their movement is genuine. I never threatened them, as some people are accusing me of doing. This allegation is completely false,"" she wrote on X.However, she justified her remarks against the BJP, which has been spearheading the agitation against the case. A BJP delegation met governor CV Ananda Bose today and requested him to protect the rights of people in Bengal and take whatever measures are necessary to lift the state out of this dire situation.Mamata wrote, ""I have spoken against BJP. I have spoken against them because, with the support of the Government of India, they are threatening the democracy in our state and trying to create anarchy. With support from the Centre, they are trying to create lawlessness and I have raised my voice against them.""The chief minister also issued a clarification with respect to her “snap back” message to her supporters against “the conspirators who need to be unmasked”.“I also clarify that the phrase (""phonsh kara"") that I had used in my speech yesterday is a quote from Sri Ramakrishna Paramahansa. The legendary saint had said that occasionally there is need to raise one's voice. When there are crimes and criminal offences, voice of protest has to be raised. My speech on that point was a direct allusion to the great Ramakrishnite saying,” she posted on her social media timeline.At the rally, Mamata had said: ""The time has come to resist and protest when you are insulted and maligned with false propaganda. Although I never promote violence, when faced with such ugly attacks, do not take it lying down and snap back. How you respond is up to you.""Following the remarks, the BJP had accused her of threatening opposition parties by abandoning her previous slogan of 'badla noy, badal chai' (no revenge, only change) in response to alleged insults from the opposition.And its not just the BJP that has been mounting pressure on her. The Congress and the Left, her political rivals in the state, have also hit the streets against her government.The Congress today took out a rally led by state president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhary from College Square to Shyambazar five-point crossing in north Kolkata, close to RG Kar Hospital.Chowdhury told reporters that Mamata Banerjee is scared of the swelling public anger and mounting protests over her alleged attempt to divert the probe and shield the real culprits.“She has even tried to threaten the agitating junior doctors of RG Kar (Hospital) who are aggrieved over the incident and blatant attempts to cover up the heinous crime by the administration subsequently. But the people of Bengal, who include the agitating junior doctors, are not to be intimidated by her or her party leaders,” he said.And while the Congress at the state level is protesting, its national leadership has been guarded in its response. Rahul Gandhi did make one mention of Kolkata incident initially, which evoked a very strong Trinamool response.Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav had last week come out in support of Mamata and had accused the BJP of doing politics over the rape and murder case.""She is a woman herself, she understands the pain of a woman,"" Akhilesh had said in Mamata's defence. Attacking the BJP, he had said, ""The BJP is doing politics in this matter, which it should not. Doctors are protesting over this incident but the BJP is doing politics.'Nationalist Congress Party (Sharadchandra Pawar) MP Supriya Sule had earlier reacted cautiously to the incident and had said she believed that Mamata Banerjee will initiate quick action and the victim's family will be delivered justice.""A lot of such incidents happen across the country and we condemn all of them. We believe that Mamata Banerjee will take action quickly and the family must get justice through fast-track court. We couldn't save our daughter from this incident but such incidents must not happen again..."" Supriya Sule had said.When President Droupadi Murmu on Wednesday reacted to the Kolkata rape-murder horror and said ""enough is enough"", both AAP and Congress were quicl to point out that the President would do well in articulating the outrage for the whole country and not just one region or state.Declaring that ""enough is enough"", President Droupadi Murmu on Wednesday said it is time for India to wake up to the “perversion” of crimes against women and counter the mindset that sees women as “less powerful, less capable, less intelligent”.Reacting to the President Murmu 's remarks, Congress' media and publicity department head Pawan Khera said, ""I welcome this statement and this intervention by the President. The entire country is outraged. So it is natural that the President represents the outrage the country is feeling.""""But the country's outrage is not just about Kolkata incident, but they are also about Farrukhabad, Kolhapur, Badlapur, Pune, Ratnagiri, Jodhpur, Katni, there are so many instances. In UP, everyday you hear about one instance or the other,"" he told PTI.""The president would do well in representing and articulating the outrage of the country felt for across the country and not just one region or state,"" Khera said.AAP MP Sanjay Singh said ""With all due respect, the President's statement shows a selective approach. The Kolkata incident is shameful and saddening but it is wrong to indicate that other parts of the country are safe.""Clearly, Mamata would welcome all these statements but she would have hoped for more open support in her fight against a very aggressive BJP, which is going all out to corner the West Bengal chief minister.",West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee accused of threatening striking doctors. Trinamool Congress and the Left have taken to the streets against her government. Opposition INDIA bloc partners have been cautious in their support for the embattled chief minister.

NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Thursday alleged that there is a growing tendency among the opposition to prevent 'indigenous Hindu MLAs ' from speaking in the assembly.His remarks came during the discussion of The Assam Land and Revenue Regulation (Second Amendment) Bill, 2024. Sarma condemned the opposition for interrupting a speech by his party MLA Bhuban Pegu.""There is a new tendency in the House not to allow indigenous Hindu MLAs to speak.It's a dangerous trend. Please do not be so aggressive. After our land, now don't try to capture the assembly,"" Sarma said.Pegu's speech referenced historical assembly records about alleged migration and aggression from the then East Bengal into Assam.""You cannot stop talking about Hindu-Muslim issues. These are hard realities of life. Even the census asks us to write down our religion,"" said the chief minister.Commenting on the Bill, which was passed by the Assembly, Sarma described it as a fight for the survival of the Assamese community, which he claimed is 'about to be extinct'. ""Our land in Dhubri, Goalpara, Barpeta, Darrang, Nagaon, Morigaon have gone. Now, we are struggling to survive,"" he added.The discussion escalated further, leading Congress MLAs to stage a walkout in protest of Sarma's statement.A delegation from the United Opposition Forum, Assam (UOFA) submitted a memorandum to President Droupadi Murmu, calling for the dismissal of CM Sarma. They accused him of failing to maintain law and order and inciting division among communities with his statements. The memorandum was handed over to the President through Governor Lakshman Prasad Acharya at the Raj Bhavan. The delegation was led by Congress Lok Sabha MP Pardyut Bordoloi and UOFA general secretary Lurinjyoti Gogoi.The opposition parties claimed that over the past two years, CM Sarma has made several provocative statements, including on the floor of the assembly, targeting the Muslim community. According to them, about a year ago, Sarma incited certain youths to expel religious minorities from Guwahati, who were working as vegetable vendors, rickshaw pullers, private drivers, and construction laborers.The memorandum also mentioned an incident where the Gauhati HC reprimanded the state government for demolishing houses of Muslim families in Batadrava, Nagaon district, using bulldozers. The court ordered compensation for the affected families.""The chief minister tried to whip up communal frenzy by targeting the Muslim community, which led to the attack on some people belonging to religious minorities in Sivasagar by BJP leaders and workers,"" the opposition parties alleged.On the issue of law and order, the opposition leaders highlighted that encounter deaths by police are reportedly the highest in Assam according to a Centre's report presented in Parliament. They also claimed that incidents of killings, dacoities, rapes, and murders have become regular occurrences during Sarma's tenure.Additionally, the UOFA pointed out a significant security lapse, stating that on Independence Day this year, the United Liberation Front of Assam (Independent), or ULFA(I), planted bombs at multiple locations. The police were unaware of the threat until the outfit revealed it via an email.The memorandum also provided statistics on sexual crimes, stating that during the BJP's rule from 2016-2023, 17,657 rape cases were recorded as per government data. Furthermore, in the last seven months alone, 580 new rape cases were reported, with 15 occurrences in August this year.""It is clear from the above facts that the Chief Minister has compromised his oath of office in the name of the Constitution, grossly violated the Constitution by creating hatred and enmity among different communities by his series of provocative statements, failed to provide security to the life and property of citizens and indulged in rampant corruption.""Besides Bordoloi and Gogoi, the memorandum was signed by state Congress president Bhupen Borah, leader of the opposition in the state assembly Debabrata Saikia, Lok Sabha MP Rakibul Hussain, CPI(M)'s Isfaqur Rahman, Raijor Dal's Russel Dal, and others.","Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma alleged that there is a growing tendency among the opposition to prevent 'indigenous Hindu MLAs'from speaking in the assembly.

Maharashtra couple can meet separated child in German foster care: MP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maharashtra-couple-can-meet-separated-child-in-german-foster-care-mp/articleshow/112910635.cms,"THANE: A Thane couple employed in Germany will be able to meet their 3.6-year-old daughter-who was separated from them and assigned to a foster care by German courts in Sept 2021-once every month, said Shiv Sena MP Naresh Mhaske.Mhaske said the Indian govt is likely to communicate with their German counterparts to ensure that the girl, who hails from the Jain community, is introduced to her native language and cultural heritage by being taken for temple visits regularly while she remains in foster care in Germany.Mhaske made the announcement following communication from S Jaishankar, Union minister of external affairs (MEA), informing him about the steps being taken by govt to not only ensure the girl is exposed to her native culture, but also efforts being taken to request their German counterparts to allow her to be brought to India.It may be recalled that the custody of the then barely six-month-old girl was assigned to the Youth Welfare Authority (YWA) by German courts after local authorities suspected she was assaulted while under the care of her parents, who had shifted to the country for work.The case was heard in the lower courts that granted custody of the child to the YWA. The Berlin Court of Appeals that later heard the case upheld the custody decision in July 2024, said Mhaske, citing the MEA communication.""The family is from Mira-Bhayander and belongs to the Jain community, whose representatives have been requesting our govt and also approached me to assist them in bringing the child back... One of their major fears is the girl may lose touch with her native upbringing and get exposed to foreign culture. I raised the issue in the Lok Sabha early this month, following which the MEA interacted with their German counterparts,"" said Mhaske.Despite the custody not being assigned to the parents, the first relief came after the YWA didn't object to granting the couple access to the child, said Mhaske, who added they are now pushing for increased interaction between the parents and their child.""The MEA has told me that the girl is being taken to the temple and could also be introduced to Indian and Jain customs and festivals in addition to familiarising her with her mother tongue. The MEA has also assured me about steps being taken to bring the child back to India... I will meet the minister in the coming days and update him about how several Indian NGOs have volunteered to adopt and nurture the child if she is brought back,"" he said.",A Thane couple employed in Germany will be able to meet their 3.6-year-old daughter-who was separated from them and assigned to a foster care by German courts in Sept 2021.

Besides, Aaditya Thackeray, Vijay Wadettiwar (Congress) and Jayant Patil (NCP-SP) were also at the fort after MVA had called a bandh.Supporters of Shiv Sena (UBT) and BJP MP Narayan Rane attacked each other at the Rajkot fort on Wednesday, the day MVA had called a Malvan bandh over the collapse of a Shivaji statue.While slogans were raised by both sides, the rival sides made counter-claims on how the clash began: Rane said they were returning from the site when UBT Sena supporters attacked them, and UBT Sena alleged the scuffle began after a woman supporter carrying the party flag into the fort was assaulted.UBT Sena leaders and workers were held up by Rane’s supporters on their return, and members of the rival groups jostled and pushed each other. Besides, there were allegations ofstone-pelting .Rane supporters held the UBT Sena leaders inside the fort for over an hour during the fracas, and the Ranes were seen arguing with police; Rane later said they said they would not allow them to return as “they had started the attack, and the stones which had been pelted by the UBT supporters had fallen at the statue site”.Police and security personnel struggled to bring the situation under control, and police reinforcements were sent to prevent any untoward incident. Rane blamed the rival camp for the scuffle. He told reporters, “We did not start anything. We were returning from the site when they (UBT workers) attacked us. We don’t get involved in petty fights. If we had chosen, n obody would have made it home.” Rane was also seen telling a policeman, “Ekekala marun takin (I will finish them all).”Sindhudurg SP S K Agrawal said, “Both sides came to the site late though they were given different time slots.”Soon after the clash, following a meeting between Uddhav Thackeray, Sharad Pawar and Congress’ Nana Patole in Mumbai, MVA announced a protest morcha against the state govt over the statue collapse. It will take place from Hutatma Chowk to Gateway of India. Pawar said the state govt was responsible for the collapse and the Navy could not be blamed. “On Sept 1, a protest will be held against Mahayuti govt,” Uddhav said. On the clash, he said, “Brokers of Modi-Shah tried to block roads.”",Supporters of Shiv Sena (UBT) and BJP MP Narayan Rane attacked each other at the Rajkot fort on Wednesday.

Two men perched dangerously on the car doors and shouted abusive comments at the women.Prachi Joshi, who posted the video quoted, ""This video is shared by female from Haldwani.""""Just tonight, I was coming back with my female friend from a movie, and suddenly two cars, full of 10 men, tried to block our way...."" she, detailed that the harassment lasted for 25 minutes.According to the tweet, the black Scorpio, with a temporary registration number, was ahead of the women, while the white Nios i20 blocked their escape from behind. The men attempted to stop them by opening their car doors to prevent them from passing.Fortunately, the first time it happened, they managed to escape. However, the men pursued them and blocked them again, but a man on a scooter appeared, distracting the harassers long enough for the women to escape once more.In her post, Joshi tagged the Uttarakhand Police, criticising them for failing to ensure the safety of women in the city. She questioned the increasing ""hooliganism"" in Haldwani and urged the police to take strict action against the men involved.

The remark, which was initially posted by one of Trump’s supporters, suggested that Harris advanced her political career through sexual favors, referencing her past relationship with former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown .The reposted comment linked Harris’s career rise to her past relationship with Brown, who was Speaker of the California State Assembly during their relationship. The remark also included a derogatory reference to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , alluding to her husband’s affair with Monica Lewinsky .Trump’s repost, which featured a screenshot of the offensive comment, followed a pattern of personal and sexist attacks against Harris.The reposted image contained a comment that read, “Funny how blowjobs impacted both their careers differently…”—a reference to Bill Clinton’s impeachment and Harris’s past relationship with Brown.This remark has drawn sharp criticism for its explicit nature and the implications it carries about Harris's career achievements.This is the second time in recent weeks that Trump has shared sexually charged attacks on the vice president, reflecting his history of crass insults against political opponents.On August 18, he shared a video from the Dilley Meme Team, which included a parody of Alanis Morissette’s “Ironic” that denigrated Harris in a similar fashion. Trump’s recent posts, including over 30 reposts in a 30-minute span on Wednesday, also featured conspiracy theories and calls for the prosecution of political adversaries.Harris’s campaign has largely avoided engaging with Trump’s personal attacks, while critics argue that Trump’s rhetoric could alienate key voter groups, including women and Black voters. Harris, the first Black woman and first person of South Asian descent to be a major party's presidential nominee, has faced such attacks throughout her career, which she and her supporters have dismissed as sexist and unfounded.Trump’s history of gender-based attacks is well-documented, including during his 2016 presidential campaign against Hillary Clinton. His controversial remarks and behavior, including a recent $83.3 million judgment for defamation against writer E Jean Carroll, have sparked ongoing debates about his conduct and its impact on his political standing.","Former President Donald J Trump reposted a crude remark about Vice President Kamala Harris on Wednesday.

Kamala Harris gains ground: New poll shows shifting dynamics in 2024 US election race against Donald Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-harris-gains-ground-new-poll-shows-shifting-dynamics-in-2024-us-election-race-against-donald-trump/articleshow/112909635.cms,"Vice President Kamala Harris has surged ahead of former President Donald Trump , leading him 45% to 41% in a Reuters/Ipsos poll released Thursday. The poll, conducted over eight days ending Wednesday, marks a significant increase from Harris's previous 1-point lead in late July.Harris’s lead is bolstered by increased support from women and Hispanic voters.She is now ahead of Trump by 13 percentage points among both demographics—49% to 36%—a notable rise from her 9-point lead among women and 6-point lead among Hispanics in July. Trump continues to lead among white voters and men, but his advantage among voters without a college degree has shrunk to 7 points, down from 14 points.The shift in the race follows President Joe Biden’s withdrawal from the 2024 race on July 21 after a contentious debate performance. Since Biden’s exit, Harris has seen a boost in both national and swing state polls.In critical battleground states—Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, North Carolina, Michigan, and Nevada—Trump holds a slim 45% to 43% lead over Harris among registered voters. However, a separate Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll indicates Harris is either leading or tied with Trump in each of these states.Republican strategist Matt Wolking acknowledged the challenge Trump faces against Harris but emphasized the importance of focusing on his campaign strategy to retain voter support. Since accepting the Democratic nomination, Harris has been actively campaigning in key states, including Georgia, to solidify her support.The enthusiasm for Harris is evident: 73% of Democratic voters in the Reuters/Ipsos poll expressed increased excitement about voting in November, a significant rise from previous polls. Harris’s appeal as a forward-looking candidate contrasts with Trump’s emphasis on his past achievements, with 52% of Harris’s supporters voting to back her candidacy rather than merely opposing Trump.Trump retains support among his base, with 64% of his voters backing him due to his policies rather than solely opposing Harris. Trump is favored over Harris on economic management, but Harris holds a strong 47% to 31% advantage on abortion policy—a critical issue for many Democrats following the 2022 Supreme Court decision.The poll, which included 4,253 U.S. adults and 3,562 registered voters, reflects a dynamic shift in the presidential race. Independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who suspended his campaign on August 23, had garnered 6% support in the survey.","Harris's lead is bolstered by increased support from women and Hispanic voters.

I stayed at a friend’s house, and then came here. I thought there would be some trains but there are none,"" she said.""I’ve never experienced all the trains stopping before.""At least three people have been killed and 78 injured in storm-related incidents in recent days, according to the disaster management agency.Bringing gusts of up to 50 metres per second (180 km per hour/112 mph), strong enough to blow over moving trucks, the typhoon was near the coastal city of Kunisaki in Oita Prefecture at 8:45 a.m. (2345 GMT) and moving northeast, according to authorities.Around 125,000 households in seven prefectures were without power in Kyushu, according to Kyushu Electric Power Co.But the warm and moist air flowing around the typhoon have also brought heavy rains in areas far from the main body, which authorities say is concerning given its slower than expected movement across the country.Notices advising residents to be ready to evacuate have been issued to more than 4 million people across the country, mainly in the hard-hit Kyushu area but as far away as the capital Tokyo and nearby Yokohama. Authorities in Yokohama said there were risks of landslides in some areas due to heavy rain.But, as of Thursday, only some 30,000 had been evacuated, mainly in Kyushu, disaster management minister Yoshifumi Matsumura said.After moving from Kyushu, the storm was expected to approach the central and eastern regions, which includes Tokyo, around the weekend, the weather agency said.Toyota suspended operations in all of its domestic plants due to the storm, while other automakers Nissan and Honda, semiconductor firms Renesas and Tokyo Electron, and electonics giant Sony also temporarily halted production at some factories.Airlines , including ANA Holdings and Japan Airlines, have announced cancellations of hundreds of domestic and some international flights.

The objective is to find a way to overturn his conviction and postpone his sentencing indefinitely, which is currently set for next month.Trump's attorneys argued that the state-level prosecution infringed upon his constitutional rights and contradicted the recent Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity .They asked the US district court in Manhattan to assume control of the New York City criminal case.In May, Trump was found guilty in state court in Manhattan on 34 counts of falsifying business records. These charges were related to a payment made to suppress allegations of an affair that had the potential to overshadow his 2016 presidential campaign.Last year, a federal judge denied Trump's initial attempt to transfer the case to federal court, paving the way for his unprecedented trial in state court.According to the filing submitted on Friday, Trump's lawyers said that transferring the case to federal court following his conviction on May 30 would provide him with an ""unbiased forum, free from local hostilities"" to address the aforementioned issues.

Efforts to manage tensions

Chinese leader Xi Jinping met with US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan on Thursday as Sullivan concluded a three-day visit focused on maintaining open communication despite rising tensions.The visit included discussions with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and top military officials, emphasizing the need to prevent competition from escalating into conflict .Sullivan stressed the importance of diplomacy in managing US-China relations , saying, ""We believe that competition with China does not have to lead to conflict or confrontation. The key is responsible management through diplomacy."" This effort comes as both nations seek to stabilize relations ahead of potential changes in the US presidency in January, reported the AP.Xi Jinping echoed this sentiment, affirming China's commitment to a stable relationship with the United States. ""While great changes have taken place in the two countries and in China-US relations, China's commitment to the goal of a stable, healthy, and sustainable China-US relationship remains unchanged,"" he said.Sullivan added that President Biden is dedicated to managing this consequential relationship responsibly, ensuring that competition doesn't escalate into conflict.Plans were made for a phone call between Xi and Biden in the coming weeks, with the potential for an in-person meeting at significant international summits later this year. Sullivan noted, ""The likelihood is they'll both be there, and if they are, it would only be natural for them to have the chance to sit down with one another.""The discussions also addressed sensitive topics, including Taiwan, the South China Sea, and China’s support for Russia. On Taiwan, Gen. Zhang Youxia, one of China’s vice chairs of the Central Military Commission, emphasized, ""Reunification of Taiwan with the mainland is 'the mission and responsibility' of the military,"" demanding that the US cease military interactions with Taiwan.Sullivan acknowledged the rarity of such exchanges and underscored their importance. ""It is rare that we have the opportunity to have this kind of exchange,"" Sullivan said. The meeting resulted in an agreement for a call between military commanders in the Indo-Pacific region, which Sullivan described as a ""very positive outcome.""A White House statement recognized progress in sustaining military-to-military communications, referencing the upcoming theatre-level call. Danny Russel of the Asia Society Policy Institute highlighted the significance of Sullivan's meeting with Xi, noting that Sullivan was seen by the Chinese leadership as ""a direct extension"" of President Biden, and his messaging was viewed as ""coming straight from Biden.""Sullivan’s visit underscored the delicate balance of US-China relations as both nations navigate their competitive but interdependent relationship.","Chinese leader Xi Jinping met with US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan on Thursday.

The campaign stop , which was meant to showcase Vance’s down-to-earth charm, instead became an internet sensation for all the wrong reasons.The now-infamous video captured Vance attempting to engage in small talk with a visibly uncomfortable clerk.With 20 Secret Service agents and 15 cameras in the shop, the woman appeared more like a deer caught in headlights than a willing participant in Vance's photo op. In his recent interview, Vance tried to put a positive spin on the fiasco, attributing the awkwardness to the clerk’s nervousness rather than any campaign misstep.“I just felt terrible for that woman,” Vance confessed, reported the NBC. “We walked in, and there’s 20 Secret Service agents, and there’s 15 cameras, and she clearly had not been properly warned, and she was terrified, right? I just felt awful for her.”Vance claimed the incident prompted him to reassess his campaign strategy, suggesting that future stops would include a more considerate approach. “I like to get out there and talk to people, and we want to make sure we’re doing it, but definitely make sure that people are at least OK with being on camera,” he added.Despite Vance’s attempts to downplay the situation, the internet was far from forgiving. Memes and TikTok parodies exploded online, with users ridiculing his clumsy interaction and speculating about his campaign team's alleged sabotage. The viral backlash intensified following Minnesota Governor Tim Walz's smooth, untroubled visit to a Nebraska sandwich shop just a day earlier. Walz's effortless rapport with the staff and his confident order contrasted sharply with Vance’s blunders, fueling comparisons and adding fuel to the fire.In his interview, Vance also took a swipe at the Harris-Walz campaign, referencing their recent Sheetz gas station stop where Walz handed Harris a bag of Doritos. Vance dismissed the staged nature of such events, saying, “We don’t want to have these scripted events—I don’t want to go and do three takes of buying Doritos at a Sheetz.”While Vance’s donut shop disaster has dominated headlines and memes, it remains to be seen how this embarrassing episode will impact his campaign’s fortunes as he battles to secure his place on the national stage.","Ohio Senator JD Vance broke his silence on the cringeworthy donut shop incident that has sent shockwaves across social media.

Bryan Kohberger Murder Case: Bryan Kohberger’s defense pushes for trial in 2022 Idaho murder case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/mob-mentality-and-deeply-held-prejudgment-bryan-kohbergers-defense-pushes-for-trial-in-2022-idaho-murder-case/articleshow/112910037.cms,"Concerns about bias and safety

Prosecution’s counterarguments

Background of the case

Bryan Kohberger ’s defense team is pushing to move his trial for the 2022 murder of four University of Idaho students out of Latah County , arguing that finding an unbiased jury there is impossible, CNN reported.Kohberger, who has pleaded not guilty to four counts of first-degree murder, is scheduled to stand trial in June 2025.The defense contends that extensive media coverage and local sentiment have prejudged Kohberger, jeopardizing his right to a fair trial .The defence argues that the ""mob mentality"" in Latah County not only threatens Kohberger’s chance at a fair trial but also endangers those involved in the case. They propose relocating the trial to Ada County , more than 300 miles away, which includes Idaho’s capital, Boise. The defense believes that the small town of Moscow, where the murders occurred, holds deeply rooted prejudicial opinions.""The traumatized town of Moscow is understandably filled with deeply heldprejudgment opinions of guilt,"" the defence stated.Surveys conducted by defence experts in Latah County revealed extreme sentiments among residents. Some respondents expressed violent intentions if Kohberger were acquitted, including threats of burning down the courthouse or engaging in vigilante justice.Amani El-Alayli, a social psychology professor at Eastern Washington University, testified that finding unbiased jurors in Latah County would be nearly impossible due to the extensive media coverage. El-Alayli explained that jurors exposed to pretrial publicity are more likely to convict based on fear-inducing headlines.“I think it would be so hard to be a member of that community and be able to come in and be objective—arguably impossible,” El-Alayli said.James Todd Murphy, president of the media analysis service Truescope, supported relocating the trial, noting that media coverage in Latah County is significantly higher compared to Ada County. Murphy pointed out that the smaller jury pool in Latah County increases the chances of exposure to the case.“This type of story will remain on the mind and be of interest up to and beyond the conclusion of this case,” Murphy said.However, Murphy acknowledged that Ada County had periods of heightened media coverage from January 2023 to June 2024. Despite this, the defence insists that Kohberger deserves a trial with an impartial jury, emphasizing that Latah County’s media coverage has often been inaccurate and inflammatory.The defence conducted surveys in several Idaho counties, including Latah and Ada. The surveys showed that the more media coverage a potential juror had been exposed to, the higher the likelihood of prejudgment.Defence expert Bryan Edelman led these surveys, which revealed significant community outrage in Latah County if Kohberger were not convicted. In contrast, respondents from Ada County felt their community would ""go on with life as always"" and ""take it well.""Additionally, the defence argued that Moscow lacks the facilities to accommodate the anticipated three-month trial. They cited similar cases where trials were moved, such as the murder trials of Lori Vallow and Chad Daybell.Vallow was sentenced to life, and Daybell to death, for the murders of Vallow’s two children and Daybell’s first wife.Prosecutors maintain that a fair trial is possible in Moscow, arguing that intense media coverage extends beyond Latah County. They criticized the defence’s survey findings, suggesting that Latah County residents who have heard about the case are statistically less likely to prejudge Kohberger.Prosecutors proposed alternative strategies, such as convening a large jury pool and thoroughly screening jurors to ensure impartiality. They also pointed out that moving the trial hundreds of miles away would be inconvenient for witnesses and the victims’ families.The case centres on the brutal murders of Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen, Ethan Chapin, and Xana Kernodle, who were stabbed to death in a home near the University of Idaho on November 13, 2022.The killings and subsequent manhunt shocked Moscow, raising concerns about student safety. Kohberger, a graduate student at Washington State University, was arrested on December 30 at his parents’ home in Pennsylvania.Law enforcement linked Kohberger to the crime through a white Hyundai Elantra seen near the crime scene and a DNA match from a knife sheath found at the scene.","Bryan Kohberger is accused of stabbing four University of Idaho students to death in 2022.

Because we want more babies, to put it nicely.” IVF treatments are known for their high costs, often reaching tens of thousands of dollars per round, with no guarantee of success.This announcement comes amid ongoing criticism from Democrats over Trump’s role in appointing Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade, ending federal abortion rights . The decision has become a significant issue for Democrats and women voters, highlighted during the party’s recent national convention and Vice President Kamala Harris' acceptance speech.In response to this criticism, Trump has positioned himself as a moderate on reproductive issues . In an interview with NBC before the Michigan event, Trump suggested he might vote to repeal Florida's six-week abortion ban, saying, “I think the six weeks is too short. It has to be more time.” However, Trump did not specify his stance on the ballot measure known as Amendment 4, which proposes a broader abortion timeline.Trump's comments drew sharp reactions from anti-abortion advocates. Marjorie Dannenfelser of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America criticized Trump for not committing to how he will vote on Amendment 4. “Voting for Amendment 4 completely undermines his position,” she said, emphasizing that Trump’s past stance was against abortions after five months of pregnancy.In addition to his IVF promise, Trump said that families would be able to deduct newborn care expenses from their taxes under his administration, asserting, “We’re pro-family.”Trump's stance on abortion has varied over the years. He had previously considered supporting a 15-week nationwide abortion ban but later declared that abortion regulation should be managed at the state level.","Former US President Donald Trump announced that the government would pay for IVF treatment.

The incident occurred on Monday as Mes was defending Ukrainian airspace, one of the few pilots trained to operate the advanced jets recently supplied by NATO allies .Mes, a member of Ukraine’s elite group of combat pilots, was piloting one of the first F-16s delivered to Ukraine, a symbol of Western support in the ongoing conflict. The aircraft had successfully intercepted several Russian cruise missiles before disaster struck.According to Ukraine's military, communication with Mes's jet was suddenly lost amid the fierce battle. The wreckage was later discovered, confirming the worst: Mes had given his life in defense of his country.Ukraine's military has opened an investigation into the crash, with early reports suggesting that pilot error or mechanical failure may have been the cause, rather than enemy fire, according to the report by NYT.Mes had been part of Ukraine's air force since the early days of the conflict. His death has sent shockwaves through the country, with many seeing it as a significant blow to both the military and national morale.The F-16s, which arrived in Ukraine just weeks ago, were seen as a crucial component in the country’s defense strategy, and Mes was among the first to be trained to fly them.The crash occurred during what President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described as one of the largest Russian attacks since the invasion began.Over 200 missiles and drones were fired at Ukrainian targets, and Mes, along with his fellow pilots, was at the forefront of the defense effort. Despite the intense barrage, the F-16s had ""demonstrated their high efficiency,"" according to Ukraine’s general staff, shooting down multiple threats. But as the battle raged on, Mes’s jet went down.On Thursday, a large funeral was held in Lutsk, a city in northwestern Ukraine, where Mes was laid to rest with full military honors. The skies above the city were filled with the roar of Ukrainian air force jets performing a flyover in tribute to their fallen comrade. The funeral was attended by family, friends, fellow pilots, and citizens, all united in grief and admiration for a man who gave everything in defense of his homeland.""Oleksiy saved Ukrainians from deadly Russian missiles. Unfortunately, at the cost of his own life,"" read a poignant post from the air force's western command on social media. The post captured the deep sorrow felt across the country, as well as the profound respect for Mes’s sacrifice.The pilot’s death comes at a critical time for Ukraine, as the country faces relentless pressure from Russian forces in the east. Mes’s passing is a stark reminder of the human cost of the war and the high stakes involved as Ukraine continues its fight for survival. While the F-16s represent hope for a stronger defense, the loss of a pilot like Oleksiy Mes underscores the ongoing peril and the sacrifices being made on the front lines.As the nation mourns, Mes’s legacy as a fearless pilot and a symbol of Ukraine's resilience will continue to inspire those who carry on the fight.
