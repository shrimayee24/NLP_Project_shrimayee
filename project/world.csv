"Objectionable dialogues to be cut, producers tell HC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/objectionable-dialogues-to-be-cut-producers-tell-hc/articleshow/110807859.cms,"Producers of the film 'Hamare Baarah' told Bombay high court on Friday they will delete allegedly objectionable dialogues and exhibit the film's edited version from Saturday. Justice Kamal Khata and Rajesh Patil allowed them to delete the dialogues so that the film's release is not stalled after a panel sought time till June 12 to take a final decision on a petition that the film portrays a minority community in a poor light.

On Thursday, the high court recalled its earlier stay on the film's release after producers said it will cause them financial loss as tickets are sold.

The judges asked CBFC to set up a three-member committee, including a member of a minority community, to view the film and inform on Friday as the first show was scheduled for 10am.

Wife's affair is cruelty to husband: Chhattisgarh high court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/wifes-affair-is-cruelty-to-husband-chhattisgarh-high-court/articleshow/110807752.cms,"RAIPUR: If a woman gets into an extramarital relationship , it amounts to mental cruelty on the husband, said Chhattisgarh high court as it overturned a lower court order and granted divorce to a man.""The appellant husband's testimony and evidence presented clearly indicate that the wife committed adulterous acts , amounting to cruelty. This justifies the granting of a decree for dissolution of marriage under Section 13(1)(i-a) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955,"" a division bench of Justice Goutam Bhaduri and Justice Radhakishan Agrawal said.The husband had moved high court after a Raigarh family court dismissed his application for divorce on grounds of cruelty.The husband said his wife's behaviour suddenly changed, triggering frequent quarrels over trivial issues. On May 27, 2014, she allegedly left her matrimonial home with their three children without informing the husband or his family. He tried to locate them, but failed, and filed a missing person's report the next day at a police station in Raigarh.He later discovered that his wife and children were staying at a friend's house in a village in the same district. He also alleged that on June 7, 2017, he saw her ""in an adulterous act"" at their home. He informed his family and police but no action was taken against the man, who allegedly threatened the husband with dire consequences.The wife denied these allegations, and alleged that her husband was abusive and prevented her from meeting their children. She claimed that the divorce application was based on false grounds.After examining the evidence and hearing both parties, the division bench noted that the couple had been living apart since 2017. The court highlighted the wife's admission during cross-examination that a male friend visited her home in her husband's absence, supporting the husband's claims of adultery and cruelty.Since the couple had been living separately for over six years, it indicated an irretrievable breakdown of marriage, the court noted. Citing a Supreme Court ruling, Chhattisgarh high court emphasised that prolonged separation can lead to mental cruelty, necessitating the severance of matrimonial ties, and granted divorce.","Chhattisgarh high court overturned a lower court order and granted divorce to a man.

A ground-to-air surveillance is being set up in coordination with the intelligence agencies and the armed forces to secure central Delhi. From using advance intrusion alert systems and posture detection mechanism to covert snipers — security forces are learnt to be using every resource possible to tackle what they said was another security nightmare.South Asian heads of govt have been invited to the oath ceremony and Bangladesh and Sri Lankan leaders have already confirmed their presence. There are three primary challenges for Delhi Police — security of hotels where heads of state and dignitaries will be staying being the prime concern. Four hotels — Taj, Maurya, Leela and Oberoi — are being brought under heavy security cover.Two other key security issues are the movement of their carcade and the security of the route between the hotel and the venue. Each dignitary will be given a call sign that will be disclosed on the morning of ceremony. This will be used for coordinating the movement of the carcade and their route to the Rashtrapati Bhawan and Kartavya Path.An elaborate brainstorming session was held at the Delhi Police headquarters on Thursday afternoon to discuss the nitty-gritty of the arrangements. According to a DCP-rank officer privy to the discussions, a decision to replicate the measures adopted during G20 was taken during the meeting. “This means that there will be venue commanders of DCP rank at each hotel where the foreign heads of state will stay. They will report to the zonal/vertical commanders of special commissioner ranks,” said the officer.While the intelligence sleuths are coordinating with their foreign counterparts — who will form the immediate security cordon of their respective dignitary — Delhi Police is working on the inputs conveyed to it in making the venues and routes foolproof. The threat perception of each foreign leader is being studied individually.The intrusion alert system and the posture detection will help cops filter out suspicious movements. “The advance AI-based cameras and software will raise alarm and alert security if a man or a woman is caught scaling the wall or shows unusual bodily movement like crawling or limp walking with a bent back,” explained an officer.The vetting and background check of hotel staffers is being undertaken by special branch and security unit and the verification reports prepared during G20 is also being studied again. There would be separate set of staffers for each floor and their movement will be contained to that floor of the hotel itself at all times.The cops and security personnel will have at least two rooms to themselves which will function as control rooms. While state borders will remain sealed during the ceremony, there will be extra vigil at malls, markets, monuments and places of worship by quick response teams, commando units, and strike forces with special vehicles.","South Asian heads of govt have been invited to the oath ceremony.

Biden asks Americans to recommit to democracy in Normandy cliff speech,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-asks-americans-to-recommit-to-democracy-in-normandy-cliff-speech/articleshow/110802630.cms,"FRANCE: Near the cliff that US army rangers scaled 80 years ago on D-Day , president Joe Biden on Friday compared the threats posed by Nazi Germany to those facing the world today by dictators and authoritarianism.Biden's speech in Normandy, his second in as many days, aimed at strengthening support for Ukraine, but it is also expected to be a rebuke of the isolationist inclinations of Donald Trump , Biden's rival in the November 5 presidential election.Biden urged Americans to remember the rangers whose dramatic heroism on D-Day helped make the invasion a success.""As we gather here today, it's not just to honor those who showed such remarkable bravery that day, June 6, 1944,"" Biden said. ""It's to listen to the echo of their voices. To hear them. They're not asking us to scale these cliffs. They're asking us to stay true to what America stands for.""On June 6, 1944, the elite ranger troops scaled the 100 foot (30 meter) cliffs overlooking Omaha Beach under withering fire and seized German artillery pieces that could have fired on American troops coming ashore at Omaha and nearby Utah Beach.By setting his speech at Pointe du Hoc, Biden echoed republican predecessor Ronald Reagan, who marked D-Day's anniversary there 40 years ago. Reagan said democracy was ""worth dying for"" and emphasized an American desire for peace in what turned out to be the waning years of the Cold War.Biden's goal was to draw a ""through line"" from World War Two , connecting the Cold War, the establishment of the Nato military alliance and Russia's current war with Ukraine, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said.Biden is in the middle of a five-day trip to France, a rare excursion abroad during an election year in which he faces a tight race against former president Trump, a republican who has threatened to use a second four-year term to punish political rivals, deport immigrants and upend global alliances.Trump has criticized the cost of supporting Ukraine after Russia's invasion, proposed higher tariffs as part of an ""America First"" policy and questioned America's decades-long commitment to Nato, saying European members are not paying their fair share.On Thursday, Biden made an impassioned call for the defense of freedom and urged Western powers to stand by Ukraine in its fight with Russia.The D-Day anniversary on June 6 and surrounding events are part of Biden's presidential duties, not a campaign event. But they gave him a chance to contrast himself with Trump.Biden, at 81 the oldest to serve in the office, has sought to rebut concerns about his age by focusing on the potential impact Trump, 77, could have during a second term.The democratic incumbent has characterized Trump, whose supporters raided the US capitol after the republican declined to accept his 2020 election loss, as a threat to US democracy.Meanwhile, hard-right parties are gaining ground in Europe, and Russian president Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday he could deploy conventional missiles within striking distance of the United States and its allies if they allowed Ukraine to strike deeper into Russia with long-range Western weapons.""This will hit the core messages that Biden is wanting to highlight during his re-election campaign but also has real resonance still in Europe as well,"" said Max Bergmann, director of the Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic & International Studies.Biden met with World War Two veterans in Normandy on Thursday and plans to meet with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Friday.","Biden urges Americans to remember the rangers whose heroism on D-Day helped make the invasion a success.

PETERSBURG : President Vladimir Putin said Friday that he sees no current threat to Russia 's sovereignty that would warrant the use of nuclear weapons but again warned Moscow could send weapons to states or others to strike Western targets .Speaking at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, Putin said the use of nuclear weapons is only possible in ""exceptional cases"" and that he does not believe ""such a case has arisen.""But he repeated a warning made days earlier that Moscow ""reserves the right"" to arm Western adversaries as a response to some Nato allies allowing Ukraine to use their weapons to strike targets inside Russia.""If they supply (weapons) to the combat zone and call for using these weapons against our territory, why don't we have the right to do the same?"" Putin asked.""But I'm not ready to say that we will be doing it tomorrow, either,"" Putin added, suggesting that it might affect global stability.He didn't specify where such arms might be sent.The United States and Germany recently authorized Kyiv to hit some targets on Russian soil with the long range weapons they are supplying to Kyiv.On Wednesday, a Western official and a US senator said Ukraine has used US weapons to strike inside Russia under newly approved guidance from presidentJoe Biden that allows American arms to be used for the limited purpose of defending Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city. The official was not authorized to comment publicly on the sensitive matter and spoke on condition of anonymity.Putin made the comments during a question and answer session with a pro-Kremlin moderator at the forum, which has been used by Russia for decades as a showcase for touting the country's development and to woo investors.Earlier in a speech, he said the Russian economy is growing despite heavy international sanctions and said Moscow has growing economic ties with countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.Putin said Russia ""remains one of the key participants in world trade,"" despite the fact that the country is under sweeping sanctions that were imposed for sending troops into Ukraine and cut off much of Russia's trade with Western Europe, the US and their allies.The main driver of Russia's economic growth is the fighting in Ukraine, now as important to the Kremlin economically as it is politicallyRussians are finding a few imported staples, and most global brands have disappeared or been reincarnated as Russian equivalents. But not much else has changed economically for most people, with massive state spending for military equipment and hefty payments to volunteer soldiers giving a strong boost to the economy.","Vladimir Putin says he sees no current threat to Russia's sovereignty that would warrant the use of nuclear weapons.

Israel draws criticism after strike on UN school shelter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israel-draws-criticism-after-strike-on-un-school-shelter/articleshow/110809024.cms,"Children walk past a destroyed classroom where people were sheltering at a school run by the UNRWA (AFP photo)

Facing international criticism of its conduct of the war and its latest strike on a UN school building being used as a shelter in Nuseirat, the Israeli military offered a full-throated defence of the operation, insisting its forces had targeted a group of about 30 militants using three classrooms as a base. A military spokesman, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, said Israel had carried out ""a precise, intelligence-based strike"" against ""dozens of Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists hiding inside a UN school."" He said some of the militants had participated in the attacks against Israel on October 7.

Hagari said the operation took place after ""three days of surveillance"" and was designed to destroy three specific classrooms in the school where the Israeli military believed roughly 30 militants were staying and planning operations. Israel twice delayed the strike because it had identified civilians in the area, he said. ""The terrorists inside the school were planning more attacks against Israelis, some of them imminent,"" he said. ""We stopped a ticking time bomb."" Gazan officials say at least 40 people were killed in the strike, including women and children. To support its contention the strike was on a military target, Israel's military released the names of nine killed in the attack that it said were associated with Hamas and Islamic Jihad.

The UN human rights office said the Israeli strike in Nuseirat ""suggests a failure"" by the military to ""ensure strict compliance with international humanitarian law"". UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres described the strike as ""horrific"", while Egypt's foreign ministry condemned what he called the ""deliberate bombing of an UNRWA school"".

John Kirby, the US national security council coordinator, said Israel ""absolutely"" has a right to target Hamas and that it is known that its fighters ""shelter in civilian facilities"", but noted that this does not give Israel carte blanche. He said that the US is discussing the incident with Israel.

Keeping up the pressure

The view from Israel

How about Hamas?

WASHINGTON: In Middle East capitals, at the United Nations, from the White House and beyond, the Biden administration is making its most concentrated diplomatic push of the eight-month-old war in Gaza to persuade Israeli and Hamas leaders to take a proposed deal that would bring a cease-fire and release of more hostages. But one week into the US pressure campaign, the world still is waiting for signs that the cease-fire appeal begun May 31 by President Joe Biden was working, by moving Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas leaders toward a negotiating breakthrough.For Israel and Hamas, the US diplomatic press has become a public test of whether either side is ready to stop fighting - at least on any terms that fall short of their professed goals, whether it's the complete crushing of the militant group or the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.For Biden, who describes the proposal as Israeli, it's the latest high-profile test of US leadership in trying to convince ally Israel as well as the militant group to relent in a conflict that is killing tens of thousands of people, inflaming regional tensions and absorbing much of the administration's focus.Here's a look at the US-led push for a Gaza cease-fire and where it stands:It wasn't that the cease-fire proposal Biden outlined in a televised address from the White House a week ago was startingly new. It was that Biden laid out the terms to the world and put the full weight of the US presidency behind the appeal for both sides to take this deal.The terms that Biden described for the first of three phases sounded much like the deal that US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators and Israel and Hamas have been haggling over for months.There would be a six-week cease-fire in which Israeli forces pulled back from populated areas of Gaza. In exchange for Israel releasing hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, Hamas would release some women, older people and wounded among hostages it had seized in the October 7 attacks in Israel that set off the war.The proposal calls for a full release of remaining hostages and an Israeli withdrawal in later phases, although the terms are vague.""Everyone who wants peace now must raise their voices and let the leaders know they should take this deal,"" Biden said a week ago.But by Friday, neither Israel nor Hamas had said yes. Netanyahu says the terms of the proposal aren't as they have been described publicly and that Israel will never cease fighting until ""the destruction"" of Hamas' military and leadership.In effect, said Nimrod Novik, a former senior adviser to the late Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, Biden ""decided to out' Netanyahu and let the Israeli public know how serious the potential for bringing all hostages out.""The US aim: ""So Israel would say yes' to its own proposal,"" said Novik, now the Israel fellow at the Washington-based Israel Policy Forum.The Biden administration isn't letting up in its drive to get Hamas and Israel on board.""The US is going to do everything it can in some formulation to keep pushing this. Until there's no place to go any more,"" said Jonathan Panikoff, a former US intelligence official. He's now the director of the Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative at the Atlantic Council's Middle East program.At the UN, US diplomats are asking the Security Council to adopt a resolution demanding a permanent cease-fire between Hamas and Israel in Gaza, over Israel's objections. Biden is sending Secretary of State Antony Blinken back to the Middle East next week for his eighth visit since the war began, a lightning tour of Middle East capitals to promote the cease-fire proposal.CIA director Bill Burns and Biden Middle East adviser Brett McGurk also have traveled to the region to garner support for the deal and show key players how it could work.The Group of Seven leading global economies endorsed the proposal. So have countries with hostages held by militants in Gaza. Biden, Blinken and other US officials are working the phones to rally support among Arab governments from Egypt and Qatar to Saudi Arabia and Jordan.Many allies appear to welcome the president's initiative to get the cease-fire talks back on course after weeks of drift, Panikoff said.There's little sign - yet - that the US efforts have been enough to change the political equation in Israel. Netanyahu's far-right coalition partners have vowed to bring down the government if the Israeli prime minister accepts the proposal that Biden outlined.Trailing in opinion polls and facing an ongoing corruption trial, Netanyahu has little incentive to risk heading to another election. Although opposition leader Yair Lapid has offered to give Netanyahu backing for a hostage deal, the two men are bitter enemies and there is little reason to think any alliance would last.Benny Gantz, a centrist member of Netanyahu's war Cabinet, has called a news conference for Saturday, where he is expected to address his earlier threat to resign by this weekend if Netanyahu failed to release a plan for the war and Gaza.Netanyahu will still control a parliamentary majority if Gantz leaves. But the departure of Gantz, a former military chief and defense minister who is respected in Washington, would weaken Netanyahu's international credibility and leave him more dependent than ever on far-right coalition partners, who believe Israel should reoccupy Gaza and oppose the cease-fire proposal.Popular protests could be one of the few scenarios that sway Netanyahu toward a deal, Novik said. Alternatively, Novik contended, just the threat of a public denunciation by Biden could prod Netanyahu toward compromise, given the United States' importance as an ally.Hamas is expected to deliver a formal response in coming days to the proposal that Biden is pushing, according to what the Qataris and Egyptians, who handle the direct communications with Hamas officials in the negotiations, told US officials this week.Senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan told reporters this week in Beirut that Biden's announcement was ""positive"" but said the group couldn't accept any deal without Israel's guarantee of a permanent cease-fire, a complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, a prisoner exchange and other conditions.While the supreme leader of Hamas and other political figures are based abroad, Hamas also must relay any proposals to Yahya Sinwar - whose opinion is paramount - and other military leaders in Gaza. They inhabit tunnels up to 100 feet (30 meters) or more underground and are believed to have surrounded themselves with foreign hostages to discourage attack.","The world is waiting for signs that the cease-fire appeal begun May 31 by President Joe Biden was working. For Israel and Hamas, the US diplomatic press has become a public test of whether either side is ready to stop fighting. Neither Israel nor Hamas had said yes.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110810249,imgsize-547942,width-400,resizemode-4/110810249.jpg"

He has since repeated his criticism of the judge in the case and suggested he could seek to prosecute his political opponents if elected again. At a campaign rally in Arizona on Thursday, Trump called his trial ""rigged"" and said the charges had been ""fabricated.""Biden took on a sharper edge when asked about his political opponent's broadsides after a recent executive order allowing the suspension of asylum at the US-Mexico border. The former president called the move ""weak and pathetic.""""Is he describing himself -- weak and pathetic?"" Biden said in the interview, which took place on the sidelines of his visit to the beaches of Normandy in France to observe the 80th anniversary of D-Day.Biden added that the White House had supported a Senate bill that would have increased funding for immigration agencies and imposed major restrictions at the border, but Republicans rejected it while taking a cue from Trump, who did not want Biden to secure an election-year win.""We had a deal that was much broader than this, much better, much more accepted across the board,"" Biden said. ""And he got on the phone and told Republicans: Don't support it.""Biden was also asked about the challenge of managing the conflicts that now dominate his foreign policy agenda.The president warned last month that the United States would block certain arms transfers if Israel targeted heavily populated areas in the southern Gaza Strip city of Rafah, but Israel has moved ahead with airstrikes in the city, which borders Egypt.Even though an Israeli airstrike Thursday in central Gaza killed dozens of people at a U.N. school complex, Biden said he believed that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was still listening to him. The president said Israel was considering ""going into Rafah full-bore.""""Come into the city, take it out,"" Biden said in the interview. ""They haven't done that.""Biden reiterated that Israel had agreed to a proposal that the president publicly endorsed last week at the White House that could lead to a ""cessation of hostilities permanently.""

As the train, part of the Final Spike Steam Tour, approached Hidalgo, the woman positioned herself dangerously close to the tracks to capture a selfie.In the video, she is seen wearing an orange top, and standing near a child, who is believed to be her son. As the train neared, the child ducked down, but the woman dropped to one knee, placing herself in the path of the train.The corner of the train's engine struck her on the back of the head, causing her to fall forward. The child ran away, visibly shocked, while a nearby man rushed to drag the woman's body away from the tracks, narrowly avoiding further harm.Local media reported that the woman was with her son and a group of children from a nearby school.

A special committee of the Punjab Assembly, led by Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan , approved on Thursday amendments allowing lawmakers to address the House in Punjabi, Saraiki, Potohari, and Mewati in addition to English and Urdu, The Express Tribune newspaper reported.

Previously a member needed permission from the Speaker to use any language other than English and Urdu, which was not always granted.

The amendment in the assembly rules aimed to enhance accessibility for constituents who speak these languages, fostering a more representative and responsive legislative body, while the change reflects the multilingual nature of the province, enabling legislators to communicate and fully participate in legislative discussions effectively.

The Speaker stated that recognising and incorporating regional languages into official proceedings also demonstrates cultural respect and acknowledgement of the linguistic heritage of Punjab, thereby strengthening the connection between the Assembly and the people.

There is a controversy over whether Saraiki, Potohari, and Mewati are just dialects of Punjabi and separate languages. Those using them consider that these were separate languages but hardcore Punjabi brand them as dialects.","Lawmakers in Pakistan's Punjab Assembly would now be able to speak in at least four indigenous languages.

Putin issues dire warning to countries aiding Ukraine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/putin-issues-dire-warning-to-countries-aiding-ukraine/articleshow/110775363.cms,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has issued a stark warning to countries assisting Ukraine, signaling severe consequences for those who continue to support Kyiv in its ongoing conflict with Moscow. In a public address on Friday, Putin cautioned, ""Anyone who tries to intervene in the Ukraine war will be met with 'lightning-fast' retaliation."" This statement underscores the escalating tensions in the region as international support for Ukraine remains strong.Speaking from the Kremlin , Putin emphasized Russia 's readiness to respond decisively to any foreign involvement. ""We have all the instruments for this, ones that no one can boast of now,"" he stated. ""We will use them if we have to. I want everyone to know that."" The Russian leader's remarks were broadcast during a meeting with lawmakers in St. Petersburg, reflecting his unwavering stance on the Ukraine conflict.Putin's comments come as Ukraine continues to receive significant military and economic aid from Western nations, particularly the United States and European Union countries. This support has been crucial for Ukraine's defense efforts against the Russian invasion, which began in February 2022. Despite international sanctions and diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict, Russia's military actions have persisted, leading to widespread devastation and loss of life.The Russian president's address included a veiled reference to Russia's nuclear capabilities, although he did not explicitly mention nuclear weapons. The warning aligns with previous threats made by Russian officials, who have suggested that any significant interference could escalate to a nuclear confrontation.In response to Putin's warning, NATO and allied countries have reiterated their commitment to supporting Ukraine. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg stated, ""Our support for Ukraine remains steadfast. We will not be deterred by threats, and we continue to stand united in defense of Ukraine’s sovereignty.""The international community remains divided on how best to address the conflict. While Western nations continue to supply arms and humanitarian aid to Ukraine, Russia has condemned these actions as provocations and escalations. Putin's recent rhetoric suggests that any further support for Ukraine could trigger a severe and unpredictable reaction from Russia.The conflict in Ukraine has drawn global attention, with numerous calls for peace negotiations and ceasefires. However, diplomatic efforts have so far failed to produce a lasting resolution. The war has caused a significant humanitarian crisis, displacing millions and creating widespread instability in the region.As the situation continues to evolve, the risk of further escalation looms large. Analysts warn that Putin's latest comments could signal a new phase in the conflict, with potentially far-reaching implications for global security.""We are at a critical juncture,"" said military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer. ""The stakes are incredibly high, and any misstep could lead to a wider confrontation.""With tensions running high, the international community is watching closely for any signs of escalation or attempts at de-escalation. Putin's warning serves as a reminder of the volatile nature of the conflict and the challenges ahead in finding a path to peace.","Russian President Vladimir Putin has issued a stark warning to countries assisting Ukraine.

Gaza: Judge orders temporary halt to UC academic workers' strike over war in Gaza,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/judge-orders-temporary-halt-to-uc-academic-workers-strike-over-war-in-gaza/articleshow/110811038.cms,"SANTA ANA: Thousands of academic workers on strike at the University of California were ordered by a state judge Friday to temporarily cease their weekslong strike over the war in Gaza .Orange County Superior Court Judge Randall J. Sherman issued the emergency restraining order after UC lawyers argued that the ongoing strike would cause irreversible harm as students are nearing finals.The university system sued United Auto Workers Local 4811 on Tuesday even though both sides have competing unfair practice labor claims pending before the California Public Employment Relations Board, which declined twice to issue an emergency injunction.The union, which represents 48,000 graduate students who work as teaching assistants, tutors, researchers and other academic employees on the 10-campus UC system, started its strike May 20 in Santa Cruz. The strike has since expanded to UC campuses in Davis, Los Angeles, Irvine, Santa Barbara and San Diego.Melissa Matella, associate vice president for labor relations, expressed gratitude for the order, saying in a statement that the ongoing strike would have set back students' learning and possibly stalled critical research projects. Officials say the strike is not related to employment terms and violates the union's contract.But the union says it is protesting the treatment of its members, some of whom were arrested and forcibly ejected by police in demonstrations calling for an end to the war inGaza .Rebecca Gross, a UC Santa Cruz graduate student and union leader, said Friday they are surveying rank-and-file workers on how to proceed.""The struggle is not over,"" she said. ""It really hasn't been confirmed yet ... that what we're doing here is illegal in any way.""On May 1, police in riot gear ordered the dispersal of more than a thousand people gathered on campus to support Palestine, and warned that those who refused to leave would face arrest. The night before, police had waited to intervene as counter-protesters attacked the pro-Palestinian encampment, causing injuries.Pro-Palestinian protests have roiled campuses across the US and in Europe as students demand their universities stop doing business with Israel or companies that support its war efforts.Police arrested protesters at Stanford University after they occupied the office of the school president for several hours Wednesday. Officials said demonstrators caused extensive vandalism inside and outside the building.","UC lawyers argued that the ongoing strike would cause irreversible harm.

"US-built pier in Gaza reconnected after repairs and aid will flow soon, US central command says",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-built-pier-in-gaza-reconnected-after-repairs-and-aid-will-flow-soon-us-central-command-says/articleshow/110802396.cms,"WASHINGTON: The US military-built pier designed to carry badly needed aid into Gaza by boat has been reconnected to the beach in the besieged territory after a section broke apart in storms and rough seas, and food and other supplies will begin to flow soon, US central command announced.The section that connects to the beach in Gaza, the causeway, was rebuilt nearly two weeks after heavy storms damaged it and abruptly halted what had already been a troubled delivery route.""Earlier this morning in Gaza, US forces successfully attached the temporary pier to the Gaza beach."" vice Adm. Brad Cooper, deputy commander of US central Command, told reporters by phone. ""We expect to resume delivery of humanitarian assistance from the sea in the coming days.""Cooper said operations at the reconnected pier will be ramped up soon, with a goal to get 1 million pounds (450,000 kilograms) of food and other supplies moving through the pier into Gaza every two days.The pier was only operational for a week before a storm broke it apart, and had initially struggled to reach delivery goals. Weather was a factor, and early efforts to get aid from the pier into Gaza were disrupted as civilians desperate for food stormed the trucks that aid agencies were using to transport the food to the warehouses for distribution.However, before it broke apart, the pier had been gradually increasing aid movement each day. Cooper said that the lessons learned from that initial week of operations made him confident higher levels of aid throughout could be attained now.A large section of the causeway broke apart May 25 as heavy winds and high seas hit the area, and four army vessels operating there went aground, injuring three service members, including one who remains in critical condition. The damage was the latest stumbling block in what has been a persistent struggle to get food to starving Palestinians during the near 8-month-old Israel-Hamas war The maritime route for a limited time had been an additional way to help get more aid into Gaza because the Israeli offensive in the southern city of Rafah has made it difficult, if not impossible at times, to get anything through land routes that are far more productive. Israel's Rafah military operations and military strikes in northern Gaza had also temporarily halted U.S. airdrops of food. Cooper said the US also expects to resume those airdrops in the coming days.President Joe Biden's administration has said from the start that the pier wasn't meant to be a total solution and that any amount of aid helps.After the May 25 storm damage to the causeway, large sections were disconnected and moved to the Israeli port for repairs. In addition, two of the US Army boats that went aground during the same bad weather near Ashkelon in Israel have been freed.Two other army boats two beached onto the Gaza shoreline took on a lot of water and sand and the Israeli Navy has been helping with the repairs, Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said.Biden, a democrat, announced his plan for the US military to build a pier during his State of the Union address in early March, and the military said it would take about 60 days to get it installed and operational. The initial cost was estimated at $320 million, but Singh said earlier this week that the price had dropped to $230 million, due to contributions from Britain and because the cost of contracting trucks and other equipment was less than expected.It took a bit longer than the planned two months for installation, with the first trucks carrying aid for the Gaza Strip rolling down the pier on May 17. Just a day later, crowds overran a convoy of trucks as they headed into Gaza, stripping the cargo from 11 of the 16 vehicles before they reached a UN warehouse.The next day, as officials altered the travel routes of the convoys, aid finally began reaching people in need. More than 1,100 tons (1,000 metric tons) of aid were delivered before the causeway broke apart in the storm, Pentagon officials said.",The US military-built pier designed to carry badly needed aid into Gaza by boat has been reconnected to the beach in the besieged territory.

NEW DELHI: Several people were hospitalised due to heat exhaustion in Phoenix, Arizona while waiting in line for an event featuring former President Donald Trump , the Phoenix Fire Department responded to the event held at Dream City Church in north Phoenix and sent 11 people to the hospital as reported by The Hill citing ABC15.

The Phoenix National Weather Service recorded temperatures reaching 110 degrees Fahrenheit on Thursday for the first time this year, later tying the daily record high of 111 degrees set in 2016. The region is expected to experience the season's first heat wave following an exceptionally warm summer last year.

Videos and photos shared online depicted several people fainting and requiring medical attention due to the extreme heatwave, as reported by The Hill.

Turning Point Action, a youth-oriented conservative group, sponsored the event to increase voter turnout by promoting early and mail-in voting, a concept previously opposed by Trump. The Arizona Republic noted that this was the second time the former president visited the Dream City Church.

In June 2020, Trump held an indoor event at the church, his second public gathering since the start of the COVID-19 quarantine. The Republic reported that church officials incorrectly claimed the installation of air purification systems capable of killing ""99.9%"" of COVID-19 within 10 minutes. It was also reported that at least eight of Trump's campaign staffers tested positive after his 2020 Tulsa, Oklahoma event, which took place days before the first Dream City Church rally.

Recent polling suggests that Trump leads President Biden by 3.3 percentage points in Arizona.

Russian court begins trial of US soldier arrested on theft charges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/russian-court-begins-trial-of-us-soldier-arrested-on-theft-charges/articleshow/110788202.cms,"MOSCOW: A court in Russia's far eastern city of Vladivostok on Thursday began the trial of an American soldier arrested earlier this year on charges of stealing. Staff Sgt. Gordon Black, 34, flew to Vladivostok, a Pacific port city, to see his girlfriend and was arrested after she accused him of stealing from her, according to US officials and Russian authorities. He faces up to five years in prison if convicted.Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported from the courtroom in the Pervomaisky District Court in Vladivostok that Black agreed to testify in the trial and will respond to the accusations against him later in the proceedings. The report also cited local police as saying that Black is cooperating with the authorities.Black's arrest further complicates US relations with Russia, which have grown increasingly tense as the fighting in Ukraine continues.Russia is holding a number of Americans in its jails, including corporate security executive Paul Whelan and Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich. The US government has designated both men as wrongfully detained and has been trying to negotiate for their release.Others detained include Travis Leake, a musician who had been living in Russia for years and was arrested last year on drug-related charges; Marc Fogel, a teacher in Moscow who was sentenced to 14 years in prison, also on drug charges; and dual nationals Alsu Kurmasheva and Ksenia Khavana.The US State Department strongly advises American citizens not to go to Russia.Under Pentagon policy, service members must get clearance for any international travel from a security manager or commander.The US army said last month that Black hadn't sought clearance for the international travel and it wasn't authorized by the Defense Department. Given the hostilities in Ukraine and ongoing threats to the US and its military, it is extremely unlikely he would have been granted approval.Black was on leave and in the process of returning to his home base at Fort Cavazos, Texas, from South Korea, where he had been stationed at Camp Humphreys with the Eighth Army.

Taiwan strongly objects to China's sovereignty claims and says only the island's people can decide their future.The United States has expressed concern about Chinese military activity near Taiwan, including after the island's presidential election and the inauguration of President Lai Ching-te last month. China has warned the US should not interfere in China's affairs with Taiwan.Taiwan and the United States have no official diplomatic relationship, as Washington formally recognises Beijing but is bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself and is the island's most important international backer.The United States recognized that if China was successful in annexing Taiwan it would impact US credibility and have ""profound, and potentially irreversible effect on the perceived reliability of US alliances worldwide"", Rudd said.The United States, China and Taiwan have a common interest in avoiding open military confrontation on the future of Taiwan, said Rudd, a China scholar who was president of the Asia Society in New York until last year.""The economic costs, domestic political impacts, and unknowable geo-strategic consequences that such a war would generate would likely be of an order of magnitude that we have not seen since the Second World War,"" he said.""Whatever the outcome (an American victory, a Chinese victory, or a bloody stalemate), the world is likely to become a radically different place after such a war than it was before.""","Kevin Rudd, Australia's ambassador to the U.S., says a war over Taiwan would be as great as the impact of the Second World War.

Sharif is currently on a visit to China at the invitation of President Xi Jinping, seeking to upgrade cooperation under the multi-billion dollar China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a key part of Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative .In a statement, the Pakistan Prime Minister's Office said during the meeting, the two sides discussed the significance of Gwadar as an important pillar of the CPEC and agreed to expedite the timely completion of all related infrastructure projects to transform Gwadar in Balochistan province into a regional economic hub.""They also expressed their firm commitment to protect CPEC from its detractors and adversaries and to upgrade CPEC in the form of enhanced cooperation,"" the statement said.The two leaders reaffirmed unwavering support for each other on core issues and expressed continued commitment and support for the high-quality development of the CPEC, Geo News reported.They also emphasised the timely completion of all ongoing projects with a special focus on industrial development, agriculture modernisation, Science & Technology and the development of Special Economic Zones for mutually beneficial and socio-economic development of Pakistan.Sharif also reaffirmed Pakistan's unflinching resolve to ensure the safety and security of Chinese personnel and projects in Pakistan.Chinese investment and financial support since 2013 have been key for the South Asian nation's struggling economy, including the rolling over of loans so that Islamabad can meet external financing needs at a time when foreign reserves are critically low.China has also invested billions in various power projects and road networks in Pakistan under the USD 65 billion CPEC plan, but the implementation of various projects has slowed in recent months.The CPEC, which connects Gwadar Port in Pakistan's Balochistan with China's Xinjiang province, is the flagship project of China's ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The BRI is seen as an attempt by China to further its influence abroad with infrastructure projects funded by Chinese investments across the world.The recurring attacks on the Chinese personnel working on the CPEC projects by militant groups in Pakistan have become a major concern for China.In March, five Chinese and one Pakistani nationals were killed in a terrorist attack on their vehicle of the Dasu Hydropower Project undertaken by a Chinese company in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province.During the talks, the two leaders discussed the entire spectrum of bilateral relations and discussed regional and global developments of mutual interest.They noted that the Pakistan-China All-Weather Strategic Cooperative Partnership was characterised by mutual trust, shared principles and strategic convergence. Premier Li congratulated Prime Minister Sharif on Pakistan's election as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council.The two sides agreed to maintain high-level exchanges including strengthening institutional linkages at all tiers and in all spheres of bilateral cooperation. Pakistan and China will also continue to consult closely on issues of regional and global significance and multilateral fora, especially during the two-year tenure of Pakistan as a non-member of the UNSC.The delegation-level talks were followed by an MoU signing ceremony.

"Pakistan HC acquits Imran, Qureshi in state secrets leak case",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-hc-acquits-imran-qureshi-in-state-secrets-leak-case/articleshow/110676116.cms,"ISLAMABAD: A Pakistani high court acquitted Monday former PM Imran Khan and ex-foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi , who were serving 10-year sentences after being convicted of leaking state secrets, known as the cipher case. An Islamabad HC division bench, comprising justices Aamer Farooq and Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb, delivered a short verdict, accepting their appeals against the convictions.

“The state had badly failed in proving its case and even its prosecutors had abandoned the case. Hats off to the honourable judges. It was a case of first impression. Imran and Qureshi did not do any anti-state activity,” remarked Imran’s counsel Salman Safdar following the verdict.

Despite the acquittal, Khan will remain imprisoned to serve his sentence in the “iddat” case, related to his alleged unlawful marriage to Bushra Bibi, his third wife. Both are serving seven-year jail terms after a trial court ruled that their 2018 marriage broke the law by not completing the waiting period mandated by Islam, called “Iddat”, after Bibi divorced her previous husband.

Qureshi remains on physical remand until June 5, accused of inciting violence on May 9 last year when Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) supporters stormed military and civilian govt assets following Imran’s arrest.

The 71-year-old former cricket star has faced a series of political and legal challenges since being ousted as PM in April 2022 after losing a confidence vote in parliament. A special court, constituted under Official Secrets Act, 1923, had convicted the two PTI politicians for sharing classified communication between Washington and Islamabad, which Khan claimed was part of a US conspiracy to overthrow his govt in 2022 after he visited Moscow just before Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Washington and Pakistan’s military dismissed the allegation.

Khan’s conviction in the cipher case was one of three charges against him leading up to the Feb 8 elections this year, which he alleged were orchestrated to prevent his return to office. Last year, the same court overturned his conviction in a corruption case involving the unlawful sale of state gifts during his term from 2018 to 2022. The gifts included diamond jewellery and seven watches, six of them Rolexes — the most expensive being $304,000.","Former Pakistan PM Imran Khan sentenced to 10 years in prison. He was found guilty of leaking classified information to his ex-wife. The pair were also convicted of giving each other gifts worth more than $100,000. They were both sentenced to five years in jail.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110676153,imgsize-766298,width-400,resizemode-4/110676153.jpg"

FIA has sent a notice to Imran on the matter.This was followed by a meeting of army commanders, which vowed to defeat what it termed “digital terrorism” by trying to induce despondency and sowing discord by peddling “blatant lies, fake news, and propaganda”. “The nation is fully cognisant of their ugly and ulterior motives and the designs of these nefarious forces,” General Munir was quoted army’s media wing as saying.Imran’s PTI had until recently been trying to disassociate itself from the controversial posts but “owned” them on his directions.
