DMK MP Kanimozhi’s Reply To Question On India's National Language Wins Applause In Spain

Poll Do you believe language barriers contribute to accidents at railway crossings? Yes No

NEW DELHI: In the tragic school van collision in Tamil Nadu that claimed the lives of three students on Tuesday, a fresh political angle has emerged. The ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) has alleged that a language barrier contributed to the incident, claiming the railway gateman posted at the crossing did not understand Tamil.According to the DMK, the lack of familiarity with the local language may have led to a critical communication lapse, ultimately resulting in the fatal crash.DMK Spokesperson TKS Elangovan said, ""Already there was an accident here and the Railway authority themselves stated that it was because the person did not know Tamil language. He could not understand what was told to him. The same thing has happened now. So, it is always better in such important positions that the people who know the local language should be posted so that it will be helpful. That will at least save the people. ""The incident occurred at approximately 7:45 am when a school van carrying students attempted to cross railway level crossing Gate No. 170 between Cuddalore and Alappakkam. The van was struck by Train No. 56813 Villupuram-Mayiladuthurai passenger.The collision caused the van to be thrown away from the crossing. The train's loco pilot managed to halt the train after some distance.Television footage revealed the severely damaged yellow school vehicle.Conflicting accounts emerged regarding the gate's status. Southern Railway maintained the crossing was closed, whilst the van driver requested opening to avoid delay. However, both the driver and an injured student assert the gate was open.The incident resulted in four fatalities, including three students initially and one who later died in hospital. The driver and another student were admitted to Government Hospital, Cuddalore/JIPMER Pondicherry. The incident occurred approximately 190 km from Chennai.Southern Railway's preliminary investigation indicated the gate was closed when the van arrived. They stated the gatekeeper improperly permitted the van's crossing, violating protocols. Legal proceedings have commenced against the gatekeeper.Southern Railway noted that an underpass project awaits District Collector's approval for the past year. The injured student, Vishwesh, and driver Shankar maintain the gate was open and no train signal was heard.A bystander who assisted the victims suffered electric shock from damaged wiring and was hospitalised. Southern Railway expressed regret and announced compensation: Rs 5 Lakh for deceased families, Rs 2.5 lakh for seriously injured, and Rs 50,000 for minor injuries.Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin announced additional compensation: Rs 5 lakh for victims' families, Rs 1 lakh for serious injuries, and Rs 50,000 for minor injuries.Railway authorities deployed a relief train with medical facilities. Senior officials, including the General Manager and Divisional Railway Manager, supervised rescue operations. The incident also damaged an overhead electrical mast.Various state officials, including Governor R N Ravi, Deputy CM Udhayanidhi Stalin, Opposition Leader Edappadi K Palaniswami, and AMMK leader TTV Dhinakaran, expressed condolences.","DMK says lack of familiarity with local language may have led to a critical communication lapse, ultimately resulting in the fatal crash.

NEW DELHI: BJP on Tuesday attacked Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, accusing him of insulting President Droupadi Murmu and former President Ram Nath Kovind with ""derogatory and casteist"" remarks, and demanded an unconditional apology.Kharge allegedly made the derogatory remarks while speaking at an event in Chhattisgarh, where he referred to President Murmu as ""Murma ji"" and then went on to mispronounce the name of her predecessor Ram Nath Kovind before correcting himself. BJP said Kharge had deliberately sighted the President and Kovind. BJP also demanded that Congress remove Kharge.Congress, however, rubbished the charge with party member Pawan Khera alleging that the attack on Kharge was reflective of ""BJP's mentality"".Addressing a public rally in Raipur on Monday, Kharge also said BJP always talks big saying that it made Droupadi Murmu and Ram Nath Kovind presidents of the country, ""but did the party do all this to snatch our assets, forests, water and land?""BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia charged Congress of having an ""anti-tribal and anti-Dalit mindset"".Bhatia also alleged that Kharge mocked Kovind. He cited a reference to Kovind to allege that Kharge called the former President ""Covid"".""You call her 'Murma ji' and then call her a land mafia, alleging that she has become President to snatch away assets, forests,"" he charged.Talking to PTI, Khera dismissed BJP's charge, saying, ""This is rubbish. This is the kind of mentality that BJP has. You appoint a tribal leader as President of India but you do uncountable injustice to tribals of Chhattisgarh, Odisha and everywhere, you are literally exploiting their resources. You are cutting their trees. You are robbing their 'jal, jungle and zamin', their identity, but when we ask them a question, they'll say the President of India is a tribal.

The loco pilot was immediately alerted to ensure that both the jumbo and the calf were safe.Divisional forest officer, Ramgarh, Nitish Kumar, said: ""A forest guard informed me that a pregnant elephant is lying on the tracks in labour pain.

We have profound respect for the martyrs of that day. We will observe it, regardless of whether it is declared a public holiday or not,” party spokesperson Imran Nabi Dar said.He said July 13 represents a collective struggle of the people of Jammu and Kashmir against the Dogra rulers and should not be given any religious colour.Party chief Farooq Abdullah said, “These were the people who sacrificed their lives to free Jammu and Kashmir from monarchy.” The party on Monday held a meeting to finalize arrangements for the day.In Jan 2020, six months after the abrogation of Article 370, the state govt removed from the list of public holidays July 13 and Dec 5, National Conference founder Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah’s birth anniversary.On Monday, J&K Apni Party chief Altaf Bukhari urged the govt “to declare July 13 as a gazetted holiday in memory of the martyrs of 1931.”In March, PDP legislator Waheed Parra brought a resolution in the assembly, demanding the restoration of July 13 as a public holiday. BJP legislator Sunil Sharma objected to his resolution, claiming that the 22 Kashmiris killed by Dogra forces in 1931 were “not martyrs, but traitors.”Sharma’s remark evoked protests from National Conference, PDP, and Congress.

Surveillance aircraft aborts mission after laser incident

Poll Should international military forces face stricter rules of engagement in shared maritime zones? Yes, to prevent dangerous incidents No, current protocols are sufficient

ASPIDES mission: Civilian protection, not combat

No immediate response from Beijing

What this means for maritime security





Germany on Tuesday said a Chinese military vessel targeted a German surveillance aircraft with a laser in the Red Sea, triggering strong diplomatic protest and the summoning of the Chinese ambassador in Berlin. The aircraft was part of the EU-led ASPIDES mission, which protects civilian vessels navigating through high-risk waters threatened by Yemen’s Houthi rebels.The German foreign office called the act “entirely unacceptable” and accused the Chinese warship of endangering both personnel and operational safety. The incident has added a new layer of tension to the already volatile maritime zone.The laser was reportedly fired earlier this month by a Chinese warship that had been encountered repeatedly in the area, according to Germany’s defense ministry, AP reported. The targeted aircraft was operated by a civilian commercial provider, with German army personnel onboard. The ministry clarified that there was no prior contact or reason given for the laser targeting.""By using the laser, the warship accepted the risk of endangering people and material,"" said a defense ministry spokesperson, speaking on condition of anonymity, as quoted by AP.As a precaution, the aircraft aborted its mission and safely landed at its base in Djibouti.Fortunately, the crew was unharmed, and the aircraft has since resumed operations under the EU mission.The ASPIDES mission, under the EU’s common security and defence policy, is focused exclusively on protecting commercial and merchant vessels transiting through the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, and the Indian Ocean. It does not participate in any offensive or military strikes.The southern Red Sea is designated a high-risk zone due to the escalating threat from Houthi rebel attacks. These attacks, often targeting international shipping, have disrupted global trade and heightened tensions in the region.As of Tuesday, China had not issued any formal response to Germany’s accusations. The Chinese embassy in Berlin and China’s foreign ministry remained silent following the diplomatic summons.Meanwhile, Yemen’s Houthi rebels launched another hours-long assault on a Liberian-flagged cargo ship in the Red Sea, a day after claiming to have sunk another vessel. The continued violence underlines the volatile environment in which the EU mission is operating.The laser incident, while not causing injuries, raises serious concerns about the rules of engagement and safety protocols among military forces in shared international waters. For Berlin, the use of a laser device by a Chinese warship with no prior warning amounts to a breach of operational norms, particularly within a peacekeeping mission.With diplomatic pressure mounting and threats in the region continuing, the European Union may be forced to revisit security guidelines, especially when multiple global powers operate in close proximity within contested zones.","A Chinese warship targeted a German surveillance aircraft with a laser in the Red Sea, triggering strong diplomatic protest and the summoning of the Chinese ambassador in Berlin.

Elon Musk's America Party: Laura Loomer predicts these people may join to spite Donald Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musks-america-party-laura-loomer-predicts-these-people-may-join-to-spite-donald-trump/articleshow/122291639.cms,"ELON MUSK Forms New 'AMERICA PARTY', Declares War On Trump & Republicans | US News

Laura Loomer predicts defections to undermine Donald Trump

A bold move from Elon Musk

Cracks within the Republican base



Conservative activist Laura Loomer has reignited political tensions by claiming that several prominent conservatives may align with Elon Musk’s newly launched America Party, not necessarily out of shared ideology, but to undermine US President Donald Trump. Loomer’s remarks, shared publicly on social media, come in the wake of Musk’s official announcement of the America Party. Musk framed it as a bold alternative to the entrenched two-party system. The tech billionaire’s increasing political activity, combined with high-profile disagreements with Trump, is stirring speculation about a growing split on the American right.The timing of Loomer’s prediction is especially notable. It came just after President Trump signed off on the controversial “Big, Beautiful Bill,” a sweeping tax and spending package that drew criticism from fiscal conservatives and Musk alike. As ideological fault lines widen, Loomer’s comments reflect growing discontent within Republican ranks and hint at a possible political realignment ahead of 2026.Shortly after Musk’s announcement, Laura Loomer took to X (formerly Twitter) to make a striking prediction. She named Tucker Carlson, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (MTG), and Rep. Thomas Massie as potential defectors to Musk’s America Party, a move she believes would be aimed at undercutting Donald Trump’s influence. “I predict Tucker Carlson, MTG, and Thomas Massie will join the new ‘America Party’ to spite President Trump,” Loomer wrote.Loomer, a longtime Trump supporter known for her hardline views, has frequently called out fellow conservatives whom she believes are disloyal or politically opportunistic. Her latest comments add fuel to speculation about rising fault lines within the GOP.Elon Musk officially launched the America Party on July 4, declaring it a response to public frustration with the current political establishment. In a widely shared post, Musk wrote, ""By a factor of 2 to 1, you want a new political party and you shall have it. Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.""His decision followed a public fallout with President Trump over the “Big, Beautiful Bill.” Musk had strongly opposed the legislation, criticizing its size and scope. His move to form a new party signals an effort to reshape the political conversation, particularly among conservatives dissatisfied with Trump-era policies.Tensions between Trump and various Republican figures have been escalating, especially over issues like government spending and party direction. Rep. Thomas Massie, a libertarian-leaning Republican from Kentucky, has frequently clashed with Trump, including during the pandemic when he opposed Covid relief packages. Trump once referred to him as a “pathetic loser.”Marjorie Taylor Greene, although once a close Trump ally, has recently voiced support for some of Musk’s positions. Tucker Carlson, meanwhile, has maintained a complicated relationship with Trump and may be open to political shifts that align with his populist brand. Loomer’s naming of these figures underscores growing uncertainty about where influential conservatives will place their loyalty going forward.Whether or not Carlson, Greene, or Massie will formally align with the America Party remains to be seen. But the speculation itself is already shifting political dynamics, raising new questions about Trump’s grip on the GOP and whether Musk can truly disrupt the conservative power structure.As the 2026 elections approach, the right is poised for internal battles that may define its future. One thing is clear. Elon Musk is no longer just a disruptor in tech.

Texas flash floods have claimed at least 82 lives, with numerous other holiday visitors and campers still missing after torrential rains triggered a rapid and devastating rise in water levels. Kerr County emerged as the worst-hit region as nearly 12 inches of rain fell early Friday morning during an overnight storm, causing the Guadalupe River to surge 26 feet in just 45 minutes. The disaster unfolded over the holiday weekend, catching many off guard and overwhelming campsites, roads, and riverside communities.This tragedy underscores a stark reality: flash floods are the deadliest weather hazard in the United States, surpassing hurricanes and tornadoes in annual fatalities. The National Weather Service reports an average of over 125 flood-related deaths each year. As communities continue to reel from this latest disaster, it becomes yet another entry in a long history of devastating US floods from Hurricane Katrina to Superstorm Sandy that reveal the escalating threat of extreme weather events. Here are the 10 most disastrous flood events in the US in the last 25 years that will shake you.The Texas Hill Country flood now adds to the growing list of flood disasters that have devastated parts of the US Here’s a closer look at some of the most severe flood events in the US:O ne of the most recent deadly events, Hurricane Helene tore through Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas, Tennessee, and Virginia in September 2024. The storm caused around 250 fatalities, most of which were due to inland flooding, not wind.North Carolina alone reported 108 deaths, and entire Appalachian communities were left cut off from electricity, communications, and vital supplies. It was the deadliest hurricane since Katrina in 2005.In July 2022, relentless rainfall triggered catastrophic flooding in eastern Kentucky, killing 45 people, according to the Associated Press.Meteorologists noted that the floods destroyed entire neighborhoods, schools, water systems, and roadways. Thousands of residents lost their homes and belongings overnight, marking one of the worst natural disasters in Kentucky’s history.A staggering 17 inches of rain fell within 24 hours in Waverly, Tennessee, in August 2021. The resulting flood claimed 20 lives, including young twin babies swept from their father’s arms. The rapid rise in water levels overwhelmed communities, destroying homes, vehicles, and businesses.One of the most infamous recent disasters, Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas as a Category 4 hurricane, then stalled, releasing historic rainfall over Houston and surrounding areas. The National Hurricane Center reported 68 deaths, with the vast majority caused by freshwater flooding. Harvey resulted in over $125 billion in damages and destroyed more than 300,000 structures.A seemingly mild rainstorm turned deadly in June 2016, as flooding swept through West Virginia. The flood killed 23 people and left dozens stranded.The event exposed vulnerabilities in emergency preparedness and infrastructure across the state.Superstorm Sandy was a powerful hybrid system that struck the East Coast in October 2012. The storm caused 147 deaths, 72 of which occurred in the USMost fatalities were attributed to drowning, and massive storm surges flooded subways, damaged homes, and left millions without power, especially in New York and New Jersey.In the spring of 2011, excessive rainfall and record snowmelt caused widespread flooding across the Mississippi River Basin, resulting in 24 deaths across multiple states including Oklahoma, Missouri, and Louisiana. Communities were overwhelmed as levees were breached and emergency systems failed under pressure.Striking the Texas Gulf Coast in September 2008, Hurricane Ike produced a 20-foot storm surge in Galveston and dumped torrential rains on Houston.The storm killed over 100 people, many due to floodwaters, and severely damaged homes, roads, and vehicles.The deadliest and costliest flood disaster in US history, Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans and the Gulf Coast in 2005.When levees broke, entire neighborhoods were submerged, forcing rooftop rescues. The death toll reached nearly 1,400 people, with damages exceeding $200 billion. The event remains a stark reminder of the catastrophic consequences of flood mismanagement and climate vulnerability.In June 2001, Tropical Storm Allison stalled over Texas and Louisiana, unloading over 40 inches of rain in parts of Houston. The prolonged deluge caused 41 deaths, with extensive damage to homes, businesses, and city infrastructure. The storm left tens of thousands stranded as emergency services struggled to respond.From Texas to Kentucky and New Orleans to New Jersey, the destructive force of flash floods has reshaped communities, taken lives, and cost the nation hundreds of billions of dollars.","Flash floods are the deadliest weather hazard in the United States, surpassing hurricanes and tornadoes in annual fatalities.

DEHRADUN: An elderly woman is battling for her life after two Rottweilers owned by a neighbour leapt over a boundary wall and mauled her while she was walking to a local temple in Dehradun's Rajpur area, police said on Monday.Kaushalya Devi, 66, suffered deep lacerations to her head, hands, legs and ear, as well as fractures in two bones, and required nearly 200 stitches. The domestic help managed to bring the dogs back inside following the attack.Devi was initially treated at Shri Mahant Indresh Hospital before being referred to another facility for surgery on her hand and ear, which was almost ripped off in the attack, which occurred around 4am on Sunday.Nafees Ahmed, owner of the dogs, had left them at the house of his friend, Mohammed Zaid, from where the dogs had pounced at the woman. At the time of the incident, Zaid was not present at the house and only a domestic help was there.Ahmed has been detained by police for questioning while Zaid was charged under BNS section 291 (negligent conduct with respect to animals). A police probe is on. Sub-inspector Mukesh Negi, who is overseeing the investigation, said Devi's son, Umang Nirwal, filed a complaint at Rajpur police station.Dehradun SSP Ajai Singh said Ahmed was detained and brought to the police station for questioning. ""We found that Ahmed didn't have the required license from the Dehradun Municipal Corporation (DMC) to keep the dogs as pets. We will record Devi's statement once her health permits, and more criminal sections could be added in the case, if needed.""He added that following incidents of attacks on people by pet dogs of dangerous breeds, the department of animal husbandry and dairy under the Central govt had earlier banned the import or breeding of dogs of certain breeds deemed dangerous, including Rottweiler, Cane Corso, Kangal, Pitbull, Pitbull Terrier, Dogo Argentino and Wolfdog.""If any resident in the city is experiencing problems due to dogs of these breeds kept as pet by people in his/her neighbourhood, then they can inform police by calling the emergency number of 112, nearby police station or the DMC office for necessary action,"" added Singh.The incident has created widespread outrage in the local community.Residents and corporator Sanjay Nautiyal met Singh and mayor Saurabh Thapliyal to demand strict legal action against Ahmed and Zaid, noting that the same dogs had allegedly attacked four other people previously.Nautiyal told TOI, ""In earlier instances, Ahmed either threatened the victims or arranged settlements to avoid police complaints. This time, too, he dismissed their concerns, daring them to take action.""","Kaushalya Devi, 66, suffered deep lacerations to her head, hands, legs and ear, as well as fractures in two bones.

The FBI has opened criminal investigations into former CIA director John Brennan and former FBI director James Comey over alleged misconduct during Trump-Russia investigation, Fox News Digital reported citing justice department sources.Two DOJ sources familiar with the matter described the pair’s conduct as a “conspiracy,” and includes allegedly making false statements to Congress.The investigation into Brennan follows CIA director John Ratcliffe's recent declassification of a “lessons learned” review of the 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA), which concluded Russia interfered in the 2016 election to benefit Donald Trump.However, the review revealed that the assessment was hastily assembled, marred by “procedural anomalies,” and deviated from established intelligence protocols.The review found that including the discredited Steele Dossier in the 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment violated core intelligence standards and damaged its credibility. It also marked the first official acknowledgment by CIA career officials of political influence in the ICA’s creation, revealing that Brennan pushed for the dossier’s inclusion, despite later testifying to Congress that he opposed it.The investigation into Brennan's alleged false statements is linked to a newly declassified 2016 email from the former deputy CIA director, warning that even mentioning the Steele dossier in the ICA could compromise the credibility of the entire assessment.""Despite these objections, Brennan showed a preference for narrative consistency over analytical soundness. When confronted with specific flaws in the Dossier by the two mission center leaders – one with extensive operational experience and the other with a strong analytic background – he appeared more swayed by the Dossier's general conformity with existing theories than by legitimate tradecraft concerns,"" the new CIA review said, as per Fox News Digital.""Brennan ultimately formalized his position in writing, stating that ‘my bottomline is that I believe that the information warrants inclusion in the report',"" it added.Regarding James Comey, DOJ sources said that he was under investigation, though they declined to disclose the specific focus of the probe.","The FBI has opened criminal investigations into former CIA director John Brennan and former FBI director James Comey over alleged misconduct during the Trump- Russia investigation.

Over 160 people remain missing after the deadly flash floods hit Texas during the July Fourth weekend, killing over 100, said Governor Greg Abbott on Tuesday.The count of unaccounted people in the Texas floods has nearly tripled since last quoted on Sunday, when Governor Abbott said that 41 people were unaccounted for across the state and more could be missing. The number of missing people counted has increased since Texas officials established a hotline for families to report their missing loved ones.Most of the people reported missing are from Kerr County, who were believed to have visited the Hill Country during the holiday and had not checked into hotels or registered at camps, Abbott said during a press briefing.Search operations are underway with crews deploying heavy machinery to clear tangled trees, dislodge boulders from riverbanks, and sift through piles of debris, reported AP.Camp Mystic, an all-girls Christian summer camp, reported the saddest loss, where at least 27 campers and counselors lost their lives. Situated at Guadalupe River’s low-lying areas, home to numerous youth camps and campgrounds, was among the hardest-hit.""We have been in communication with local and state authorities who are tirelessly deploying extensive resources to search for our missing girls,"" the camp said in a statement posted on its website.Meteorologist Bob Henson from Yale Climate Connections notes that this tragedy marks the most fatal inland flooding event in the US since the Big Thompson Canyon flood in Colorado on July 31, 1976, which claimed the lives of 144 individuals during the state's centennial celebrations.Watch | Texas floods: Road disappears in minutes as water surge","Over 160 people remain missing after the deadly flash floods hit Texas during the July Fourth weekend, killing over 100.

Flash floods in mountain village of Ruidoso, New Mexico, swept away an entire home, leaving residents stranded in cars and houses. Damage reports indicate that floodwaters entered multiple homes and several roads throughout Ruidoso were submerged, Fox News reported.Emergency crews carried out at least 85 swift-water rescues in the area, helping people escape from homes and vehicles, said Danielle Silva of the New Mexico Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management.No injuries or deaths were immediately reported. However, officials said they wouldn’t know the full damage until the floodwaters went down, AP reported.As the Rio Ruidoso river rose nearly 19 feet in just minutes, officials warned residents to move to higher ground. The National Weather Service issued flood warnings for the area, which had lost much of its vegetation in recent wildfires, making it more prone to flooding.Silva confirmed that two National Guard rescue teams and several local teams were already present in the area when the flooding began. More Guard teams were on their way.The area has been especially at risk for flooding since the summer of 2024, when the South Fork and Salt fires burned dry forests and destroyed about 1,400 homes and buildings.Last summer, residents had to flee wildfires only to grapple with intense flooding afterward.Silva said Tuesday’s floodwaters seemed even higher than last summer’s, describing it as a significant amount of water flowing through the area, including some places that did not flood last year.Matt DeMaria, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Albuquerque said the storms developed over land that was burned in last year’s fires.Preliminary measurements showed the Rio Ruidoso rose to 20 feet above normal, above its ordinary level before starting to recede Tuesday evening.(This is a top Google Trends topic)","Flash floods in mountain village of Ruidoso, New Mexico, swept away an entire home, leaving residents stranded in cars and houses.

Trump says New York City, DC could face federal takeovers





US President Donald Trump on Tuesday (local time) suggested that the federal government might take control of New York City and Washington, claiming the White House holds the authority to intervene in cities if needed.Speaking at a Cabinet meeting at the White House, Trump was asked about New York City's upcoming mayoral election. He said, ""We're not going to have -- if a communist gets elected to run New York, it can never be the same. But we have tremendous power at the White House to run places when we have to.""Trump criticised Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani , who identifies as a democratic socialist, and also mentioned other candidates like Eric Adams, Andrew Cuomo, and Curtis Sliwa, though he did not endorse anyone.He also slammed New York's ranked-choice voting system and called his relationship with current Mayor Eric Adams a ""test.""""New York City will run properly,"" he told ABC news. ""We're going to bring New York back,” he added.Turning his attention to Washington DC, he cited that the federal government could take over the city because of concerns about crime. “We could run DC. We're looking at DC. We don't want crime in DC.We want the city to run well,” he said.He added that his chief of staff, Susie Wiles, was talking with Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser.Trump has long called for the federal government to take over Washington, complaining that local leaders weren't effective and arguing the city has become riddled with crime.However, the preliminary data from the Metropolitan Police Department shows that violent crime is down by 25% from last year and overall crime is down by 8%.Trump said on Tuesday that if the federal government ran Washington, it would be managed well and crime would be much lower.""We would run it so good, it would be run so proper, we'd get the best person to run it,"" Trump said.""And we know the crime would be down to a minimum, would be much less. And, you know, we're thinking about doing it, to be honest with you,"" he added.Trump said he wants the capital city to be run perfectly and believes the federal government could manage it easily. He added that his team has a good relationship with the mayor and is currently testing whether their plan will work.Washington DC has some autonomy under the 1973 Home Rule Act. It grants residents the ability to manage their affairs by electing a mayor and city council members. However, Congress has the final say over the city's laws and budget.","Trump says New York City, DC could face federal takeovers.

'Targeted women': ICC issues arrest warrants for two top Taliban leaders; Taliban calls it 'nonsense',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/targeted-women-icc-issues-arrest-warrants-for-two-top-taliban-leaders-taliban-calls-it-nonsense/articleshow/122330890.cms,"International Criminal Court (Official website image)





The International Criminal Court on Tuesday (local time) issued arrest warrants against two top Taliban leaders, accusing them of persecuting girls and women in Afghanistan, CNN reported.In a statement, ICC clarified that the two men, Taliban supreme leader Haibatullah Akhundzada and chief justice Abdul Hakim Haqqani are accused of encouraging the abuse of women, girls and others who don’t adhere with the Taliban’s policy on gender.In response, the Taliban called the arrest warrants “nonsense” and said they don’t recognize the ICC. They also accused the court of showing hatred toward Islam by calling their interpretation of Islamic law a crime.Back in January, the ICC’s chief prosecutor said the duo has been criminally responsible for carrying out gender-based persecution since at least August 15, 2021, when the Taliban took over Afghanistan.Since returning to power in 2021, the Taliban have imposed harsh restrictions on women and girls. Girls are banned from attending school beyond sixth grade. Women must cover their entire bodies and faces in public and are not allowed to speak to or look at men outside their families.The sound of women’s voices in public has also been restricted.The ICC said the Taliban have especially targeted women and girls because of their gender, taking away their basic rights and freedom.“While the Taliban have imposed certain rules and prohibitions on the population as a whole, they have specifically targeted girls and women by reason of their gender, depriving them of fundamental rights and freedoms,” the ICC said on Tuesday.“Specifically, the Taliban severely deprived, through decrees and edicts, girls and women of the rights to education, privacy and family life and the freedoms of movement, expression, thought, conscience and religion,” it continued.The regime has also targeted people who support women’s rights and LGBTQ people whose identities don’t fit the Taliban’s rules on gender.The arrest warrants were issued one day after the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution expressing deep concern about the worsening oppression of women and girls in Afghanistan. The UN called on the Taliban to quickly reverse these policies.Lisa Davis, ICC’s Special Adviser on Gender and Other Discriminatory Crimes, said this is the first time an international court has recognized LGBTQ people as victims of crimes against humanity for gender persecution, according to media reports.Human rights groups have welcomed the ICC move. Amnesty International’s Secretary General Agnes Callamard called it an important step toward holding those responsible accountable.Liz Evenson, the international justice director of Human Rights Watch said the arrest warrants could provide victims and their families with an essential pathway to justice.","Taliban supreme leader Haibatullah Akhundzada and chief justice Abdul Hakim Haqqani are accused of encouraging the abuse of women, girls and others who don’t adhere with the Taliban’s policy on gender.

LOS ANGELES: Growing up, Sage Sol Pitchenik wanted to hide.""I hated my body,"" the nonbinary 16-year-old said. ""I hated looking at it.""When therapy didn't help, Pitchenik, who uses the pronoun they, started going to the Centre for Trans youth health and development at children's hospital Los Angeles, the country's biggest public provider of gender-affirming care for children and teens. It changed their life.But in response to the Trump administration's threat to cut federal funds to places that offer gender-affirming care to minors, the centre will be closing its doors July 22. Pitchenik has been among the scores of protesters who have demonstrated regularly outside the hospital to keep it open.""Trans kids are done being quiet. Trans kids are done being polite, and trans kids are done begging for the bare minimum, begging for the chance to grow up, to have a future, to be loved by others when sometimes we can't even love ourselves,"" Pitchenik said, prompting cheers from dozens of protesters during a recent demonstration.They went to the centre for six years.""There's a lot of bigotry and just hate all around, and having somebody who is trained specifically to speak with you, because there's not a lot of people that know what it's like, it meant the world,"" they told The Associated Press.The centre's legacy In operation for three decades, the facility is among the longest-running trans youth centres in the country and has served thousands of young people on public insurance.Patients who haven't gone through puberty yet receive counselling, which continues throughout the care process. For some patients, the next step is puberty blockers; for others, it's also hormone replacement therapy. Surgeries are rarely offered to minors.""I'm one of the lucky ones,"" said Pitchenik, who received hormone blockers after a lengthy process. ""I learned how to not only survive but how to thrive in my own body because of the lifesaving health care provided to me right here at children's hospital Los Angeles.""Many families are now scrambling to find care among a patchwork of private and public providers that are already stretched thin. It's not just patient care, but research development that's ending.""It is a disappointment to see this abrupt closure disrupting the care that trans youth receive. But it's also a stain on their legacy,"" said Maria Do, community mobilization manager at the Los Angeles LGBT centre. ""I think it showcases that they're quick to abandon our most vulnerable members.""The closure comes weeks after the supreme court upheld Tennessee's ban on gender-affirming care for minors, amid other efforts by the federal government to regulate the lives of transgender people.The hospital initially backed off its plans to close after it announced them in February, spurring demonstrations, but later doubled back.The centre said in a statement that ""despite this deeply held commitment to supporting LA's gender-diverse community, the hospital has been left with no viable path forward"" to stay open.""Centre team members were heartbroken to learn of the decision from hospital leaders, who emphasized that it was not made lightly, but followed a thorough legal and financial assessment of the increasingly severe impacts of recent administrative actions and proposed policies,"" the statement said.California attorney general Rob Bonta has warned that by closing the centre, the hospital is violating state antidiscrimination laws, but his office hasn't taken any further actions. Bonta and attorney generals from 22 other states sued the Trump administration over the executive order in February.""The Trump administration's relentless assault on transgender adolescents is nothing short of an all-out war to strip away LGBTQ+ rights."" Bonta told the AP in an email. ""The administration's harmful attacks are hurting California's transgender community by seeking to scare doctors and hospitals from providing non-discriminatory healthcare. The bottom line is: This care remains legal in California.""LGBTQ+ protesters and health care workers offer visibility Still wearing scrubs, Jack Brenner, joined protesters after a long shift as a nurse in the hospital's emergency room, addressing the crowd with a megaphone while choking back tears.""Our visibility is so important for our youth,"" Brenner said, looking out at a cluster of protesters raising signs and waving trans pride flags. ""To see that there is a future, and that there is a way to grow up and to be your authentic self.""Brenner, who uses the pronoun they, didn't see people who looked like them growing up or understand what being trans meant until their mid-20s.""It's something I definitely didn't have a language for when I was a kid, and I didn't know what the source of my pain and suffering was, and now looking back, so many things are sliding into place,"" Brenner said. ""I'm realizing how much gender dysphoria was a source of my pain.""Trans children and teens are at increased risk of death by suicide, according to a 2024 study from the centres for disease control and prevention.Brenner described encountering young patients in the emergency room who are trans or otherwise on the gender-nonconforming spectrum and ""at the peak of a mental health crisis."" Brenner wears a lanyard teeming with colourful pins emblazoned with the words ""they/them"" to signal their gender identity.""I see the change in kids' eyes, little glints of recognition, that I am a trans adult and that there is a future,"" Brenner said. ""I've seen kids light up when they recognize something of themselves in me. And that is so meaningful that I can provide that.""Beth Hossfeld, a marriage and family therapist, and a grandmother to an 11- and 13-year-old who received care at the centre, called the closure ""patient abandonment.""""It's a political decision, not a medical one, and that's disturbing to me,"" she said.","The Centre for Trans youth health and development at children's hospital Los Angeles will be closing its doors July 22. It is the country's biggest public provider of gender-affirming care for children and teens. Protesters have demonstrated regularly outside the hospital to keep it open.

Donald Trump resumes weapons supply to Ukraine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-resumes-weapons-supply-to-ukraine/articleshow/122330425.cms,"File photo





President Donald Trump stepped up his criticism of President Vladimir Putin of Russia on Tuesday, accusing him of duplicity a day after saying that Ukraine needed more weapons to defend itself against Russian's invasion.""We get a lot of bullshit thrown at us by Putin, if you want to know the truth,"" Trump told reporters during a cabinet meeting. ""He's very nice to us all the time, but it turns out to be meaningless.""The harsh rhetoric was notable for Trump, who has often expressed skepticism of US aid to Ukraine and admiration for Putin's intelligence and strength. Just months ago, Trump dressed down President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine in the Oval Office, claiming he had been insufficiently grateful for America's support. But Trump has increasingly suggested that Putin has become an impediment to the peace deal he is seeking to negotiate.Trump said Monday the US was resuming munitions shipments to Ukraine to help it fend off Russia's invasion. Just last week, White House acknowledged the administration had paused delivery of some air defence interceptors and precision-guided bombs and missiles to Ukraine, citing Pentagon concerns that US weapons stockpiles were dwindling.On Tuesday, Trump refused to say whether he knew in advance about the pause on munitions shipments. While seated beside his defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, Trump was repeatedly pressed about who ordered the pause. ""I don't know,"" he said to the reporter. ""Why don't you tell me?"" Throughout his remarks, he repeatedly railed against how Russia is carrying out its war against Ukraine.""We're not happy with Putin. I'm not happy with Putin. I can tell you that much right now, because he's killing a lot of people,"" Trump said. At another point, he said Putin was ""not treating human beings right,"" adding he was ""killing too many people, so we're sending some defensive weapons to Ukraine... They have to be able to defend themselves... So many people are dying in that mess.""",President Donald Trump stepped up his criticism of President Vladimir Putin of Russia on Tuesday.

US President Donald Trump, on Tuesday, took a jab at longtime rival, New York Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer, predicting that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of the “Squad” would defeat him if she runs against him in 2028.“I saw a Palestinian senator, his name is Schumer. He’s a great Palestinian,” remarked Trump while referring to Chuck Schumer, who is actually the highest ranking Jewish official in the US governement, as reported by the New York Post.“He’s become a Palestinian, he has abandoned the Jews,” said Trump while getting sidetracked during a discussion on the deadly Texas floods. Citing that the senate minority leader was prone to blame him for crises situations, Trump remarked on the top Senate Democrat’s demands for better conditions for Palestinians and his criticism of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Speaking on Schumer and the recent devastating Texas floods Trump said, “ “This was Schumer, he goes, ‘Yeah, yeah, it’s Trump’s fault. That’s right, it’s Trump.’ “Schumer had yesterday asked a government watchdog to look more into whether the Trump government’s cuts National Weather Service had in any way affected how the disaster was handled, as reported by Times of Israel.“I actually saw that stupid guy try and blame [the Texas flooding] on me, and I said, ‘Man, that’s a tough one to take,’” said Trump referring to Schumer.“But his career is limited because I hear AOC is gonna beat him,” he added.Alexandra Ocasio Cortez, 38 as well as Chuck Schumer, 74 have not yet announced their plans for the 2028 elections. Several polls have indicated that Schumer trails behind the Democratic socialist in a potential matchup. Ocasio-Cortez is also reportedly considering a run for president, as reported by the New York Post.Discussion around Schumer’s electoral prospects has gained traction, with growing speculation about his ability to hold off potential challengers, including revolt within his own party. During the 2022 midterm election Ocasio-Cortez had refused to challenge Schumer.Schumer had been previously issued a warning over his sharp criticism of Republican lawmakers in the context of the Trump administration’s “Big Beautiful Bill”. “Our colleagues of the Republican side lack courage of their convictions to do the right thing for the American people. It’s outrageous,” he had said.","US President Donald Trump, on Tuesday, took a jab at longtime rival, New York Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer. Trump predicted that Rep.

Win for Trump: US supreme court allows for downsizing federal workforce; Thousands already out of work,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/win-for-trump-us-supreme-court-allows-for-downsizing-federal-workforce-thousands-already-out-of-work/articleshow/122328250.cms,"Donald Trump (AP)





The US Supreme Court on Tuesday gave the green light to President Donald Trump’s plan to reduce the size of the federal workforce despite concerns that it could disrupt essential government services and potentially leave thousands of federal employees unemployed.The ruling overrides lower court orders that had temporarily blocked the cuts, which have been spearheaded by the Department of Government Efficiency, as reported by AP.“This executive action promises mass employee terminations, widespread cancellation of federal programs and services, and the dismantling of much of the Federal Government as Congress has created it,"" wrote Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson and accused her colleagues of demonstrating, “enthusiasm for greenlighting this President’s legally dubious actions in an emergency posture.”In an unsigned order, the court had noted that it was not reviewing any specific job cuts but rather an executive order issued by Trump and a directive from his administration instructing to undertake job reductions.Tens of thousands of federal workers have already been laid off, either leaving their jobs through delayed resignation plans or being put on leave. At least 75,000 employees have taken deferred resignation and thousands of workers in the probation period are left unemployed.A coalition of unions, non-profit and local governments that sued to stop the administration’s mass layoffs said on Tuesday that the supreme court, ""dealt a serious blow to our democracy and puts services that the American people rely on in grave jeopardy,” as reported by Reuters.The labor unions and nonprofits that challenged the downsizing told the justices it could lead to staffing cuts of 40 to 50 percent at several agencies if allowed to proceed. Cities like Baltimore, Chicago and San Francisco were among those who sued.In recent times, the supreme court has sided with Trump’s decisions, and judges have allowed him to move forward with key elements of his efforts to renew the federal government. So far, the Supreme Court has stepped in mainly in response to emergency appeals from the Justice Department, which argues that lower-court rulings have wrongly interfered with presidential powers.Trump has consistently claimed that the voters gave him the mandate to carry out reforms and as such had appointed his former ally, Elon Musk, to lead the effort through DOGE, as reported by AP. Musk has since stepped down from his role.District Judge Susan Illston ruled that the Trump administration must obtain congressional approval to carry out major cuts to the federal workforce. A 2-1 panel decision from the US 9th Circuit Court upheld her order, warning that the proposed slashing could have wide-reaching effects, including challenges in the food safety and healthcare systems for veterans.The Justice Department stated in its filing to the Supreme Court that controlling federal agency personnel “lies at the heartland” of the president’s executive branch authority. ""The Constitution does not erect a presumption against presidential control of agency staffing, and the president does not need special permission from Congress to exercise core Article II powers,"" said the filing, as reported by Reuters.Illston had ordered multiple federal agencies to stop implementing the president’s workforce executive order, signed earlier in February, along with a follow-up memo from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and the Office of Personnel Management.The order greatly affects agencies like departments of Energy, Labour, Agriculture, the Treasury, the Interior, State, as well as Veterans Affairs. It also affects the National Science Foundation, Small Business Association, Social Security Administration, and Environmental Protection agency.","The US Supreme Court on Tuesday gave the green light to President Donald Trump’s plan to reduce the size of the federal workforce.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed a threat by New York City’s Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani to have him arrested during a future visit to the city, calling it “silly” and “folly"", and hinted at plans to visit New York city despite the social candidate’s warning, as reported by New York Post.“I am not concerned about that,” Netanyahu told reporters at the White House on Monday during his working dinner with US president Donald Trump. “There’s enough craziness in the world, but I guess it never ends. This is folly and it’s silly in many ways,” he added.Last year, Mamdani told Zeteo he would not welcome Netanyahu to New York City, citing the International Criminal Court's arrest warrants issued for both Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.“No. As mayor, New York City would arrest Benjamin Netanyahu. This is a city that our values are in line with international law. It’s time that our actions are also,” Mamdani had said last year. Mamdani has also publicly rejected recognizing Israel as a Jewish state.Netanyahu has assured that he will visit New York with Trump and responding to Mamdani’s threat while Trump has said “I’ll get him out”, as reported by Times of Israel.Netanyahu is expected to be in New York before next year as he typically speaks at the UN General Assembly’s high-level annual meeting held every September.“He’s going to be very fine. And we don’t know who the mayor is going to be yet, but this is a communist. He’s not a socialist. He’s a communist, and he’s said some really bad things about Jewish people,” Trump has stated.Referring to Mamdani, Trump has said, “He’s going through a little bit of a honeymoon right now, [and] he might [win], but it all comes through the White House. He needs the money through the White House… He’s going to behave… He better behave, otherwise he’s going to have big problems,” as reported by Times of Israel.Trump also renewed his threat to use federal aid as leverage against New York City if Mamdani challenges his administration.At the White House dinner earlier this year, Trump had proposed a relocation plan for Gaza's population while Netanyahu nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize on Monday. The US president reiterated that he played an essential role in brokering a peace deal in several countries.Zohran Mamdani 38, democratic socialist, has secured the Democratic nomination and mayoralty of New York City and is a critic of Israel and Netanyahu. The general elections are not scheduled until November.He was born to Indian-origin parents Mira Nair, a widely celebrated Indian-American filmmaker and Mahmood Mamdani an Indian-born Ugandan academician.","Netanyahu dismissed a threat by New York City’s Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani to have him arrested during a future visit to the city. “I am not concerned about that,” Netanyahu told reporters at the White House on Monday during his working dinner with US president Donald Trump.

U nited States President Donald Trump dodged the question on the ""creep"" Jeffrey Epstein case and slammed the reporter for raising this issue, saying that ""you are a waste of time. ""In a presser, when a reporter asked about the Epstein case, Trump asked how a reporter could ask such a question when the country is going through some great problems like the Texas flood and had seen success with Operation Midnight Hammer.""Are you still talking about Jeffrey Epstein? This guy we have been talking about for years. You are asking... We have Texas and other issues, and people are still talking about this creep guy that is unbelievable. You are a waste of time. I mean I can't believe you are asking a question about him and at a time like this when we are are having some of the greatest success and tragedy with what happened in Texas. It seems like a disaggregation,"" Trump asked.Recently, the Epstein case has picked up a new speed after Elon Musk's fall out with Trump last month. Musk accused the US president of being “in the Epstein files.” Trump responded by sharing a statement from former Epstein lawyer David Schoen, who said Trump wasn’t implicated in any crime.Musk later deleted his posts, admitting he “went too far.”The department of justice memo released this week confirmed there was no Epstein “black book” of clients and no credible evidence of blackmail. It also reaffirmed that Epstein died by suicide while in federal custody in 2019. But that hasn’t quelled online outrage among Trump-aligned influencers, many of whom feel betrayed by Attorney General Pam Bondi’s earlier claim that such a list existed and was on her ""desk. ”As Trump’s press secretary Karoline Leavitt fielded tough questions at the White House and far-right figures like Jack Posobiec and Elon Musk fanned the flames on social media Vance found himself at the center of the controversy.But critics argue that Trump administration is facing the backlash of its own making. Figures like Vance, Bondi, and others spent years stoking conspiracy theories about Epstein, only to now retreat from them as the lack of new evidence becomes undeniable.","US President Donald Trump dodged the question on the ""creep"" Jeffrey Epstein case and slammed the reporter for raising this issue.

The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and other federal officers involved in immigration enforcement have come under attack in at least two ambush incidents recently in Texas, as per Fox News.The US Justice Department on Monday announced charges against 10 individuals accused of shooting a police officer in the neck and firing at other correctional officers outside the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, Texas, during a Fourth of July attack.”Make no mistake, this was not a peaceful protest,” said Nancy Larson, acting US attorney for the Northern district of Texas. ""This was an ambush on federal and local law enforcement officers,” she added, as reported by NBC.In the attack, the group was dressed in all black, and reportedly started shooting fireworks at the facility which is used by the Department of Homeland Security to detain individuals engaged in immigration violations or awaiting deportation.The complaint notes that the defendants were ""dressed in black, military-style clothing,"" some were donning body armor, some were armed, and some carried two-way radios.The individuals charged are Cameron Arnold, also known as Autumn Hill; Savannah Batten; Nathan Baumann; Zachary Evetts; Joy Gibson; Bradford Morris, also known as Meagan Morris; Maricela Rueda; Seth Sikes; Elizabeth Soto; and Ines Soto. Three of the perpetrators are each charged with three counts of attempted murder of a federal officer and with three charges of firing a weapon during, in connection with and in support of a violent crime.Roughly 10 minutes after gathering at the ICE facility, one or two individuals separated from the main group and began spraying graffiti on vehicles and a guard post in the parking lot, as per the authorities. Photographs included in the criminal complaint, filed in the Northern District of Texas show messages like “ICE pig” scrawled on the vehicles. Correctional officers informed 911, prompting a response from an Alvarado police officer.As the officer got out of his vehicle, a suspect hiding in the nearby woods allegedly shot him in the neck, the complaint states Another attacker, wearing a green mask and positioned across the street then allegedly fired 20 to 30 rounds at correctional officers who were unarmed, as they came outside.The group fled the scene, and sheriff's deputies stopped seven individuals roughly 274 meters from where the officer was shot, as reported by AP.""The shooting was captured by both CCTV and the APD officer's body-worn camera,"" the complaint says, as reported by FOX news.“There was an AR-style rifle found at the scene” that was jammed, said Nancy Larson.Law enforcement also found a flag that read, “RESIST FASCISM-FIGHT OLIGARCHY” while flyers stating , ""FIGHT ICE TERROR WITH CLASS WAR!"" and ""FREE ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS,"" were also found along with spray paint and magazines with ammunition.“It was a planned ambush with the intent to kill ICE corrections officers,” said Nancy Larson, as reported by AP.The shooting happened three days before another incident on Monday, when a man with an assault rifle opened fire at federal agents and a US Border Patrol facility in McAllen, about 643 kilometers south, injuring a police officer before being shot and killed by authorities, as reported by AP.The attacker is identified as 27-year-old Ryan Louis Mosqueda.On the fourth of July, four other suspects were arrested for allegedly targeting an ICE facility in Portland Oregon. The accused are Jeremy Andrew Hummel, Andrew Lee Wyatt Marcum, Riley Freeman and Ian Joseph McCarthy.Freeman, Marcum, and McCarthy appeared in federal court on Monday and were released pending further legal proceedings, according to KATU.Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said Saturday that the Justice Department was ""closely monitoring the attacks on DHS detention facilities in Prairieland, TX, and Portland, OR, and are coordinating with the USAOs and our law enforcement partners.""Since June, nearly two dozen people have been arrested in association with protests and attacks taking place in an ICE facility in Portland. The shooting comes amid US president Donald Trump ramping up deportations, which are set to accelerate further following the passage of a major spending bill last week.","The US Justice Department on Monday announced charges against 10 individuals accused of shooting a police officer in the neck and firing at other correctional officers.

Gulzar Dost, a well-known social activist and convener of Kech Civil Society, was arrested on Monday in a wider effort by the Pakistani state to silence dissent in Balochistan.According to The Balochistan Post, Dost was taken from his home in Turbat during a raid by the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) and later charged with what The Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) says were “false and politically motivated” allegations. It has demanded his immediate release.Dost was arrested early Monday morning during a CTD raid at his residence in Turbat. He was then brought before a court and charged, though the exact nature of the charges has not been publicly detailed.In a post on X, BYC described Dost as a peaceful citizen who has always spoken up for families of forcibly disappeared persons and victims of extrajudicial killings.“His only ‘crime’ is standing with the oppressed,” BYC said. “The state cannot tolerate that.”The committee also criticised the CTD, calling it a tool of state repression used to target grassroots activists. It accused authorities of carrying out unlawful raids, filing fake cases, and using forced disappearances to suppress political voices.BYC has demanded Dost’s unconditional release and warned that the continued targeting of activists will only increase resistance in the region.“If the state thinks it can create silence in Balochistan by targeting political activists, it is gravely mistaken,” the group said.The arrest is part of what rights groups say is an increasing pattern of intimidation against Baloch activists. Just two days ago, at least five men were reportedly forcibly disappeared by Pakistani security forces during a series of raids in the Kech and Gwadar districts of Balochistan.A wave of anger has swept across Pakistan’s troubled Balochistan province after the reported abduction and killing of young Baloch activist Zeeshan Ahmed by military personnel. Zeeshan had been actively campaigning for the safe return of his father, Zaheer Ahmed, who was forcibly disappeared by the Frontier Corps back in 2015.","Gulzar Dost, a well-known social activist and convener of Kech Civil Society, was arrested on Monday.

Pakistani authorities confiscated eighteen lions kept illegally as pets in the densely populated Punjab region during a targeted operation, provincial officials said Monday.Authorities launched a crackdown after a lion escaped from a house in Lahore, the capital of Punjab province, and attacked a woman and two children. The incident, which took place last week, was captured on video.None of the people suffered life-threatening injuries, according to provincial officials. The lion, which was kept without a license in a house in Lahore, was confiscated.The lion was sent to a local safari park, according to Mubeen Elahi, director general of the provincial Wildlife and Parks Department.Police said the owner was arrested.Keeping a lion at home without following the legal requirements for ownership of big cats is an offense punishable by up to seven years in jail, Elahi told the Reuters news agency.As well as confiscating the 18 animals, the department raided 38 lion and tiger breeding farms and arrested eight people for violating the rules, he said.There are more than 500 lions and tigers in homes and breeding farms in Punjab, Elahi said, adding they would be inspected by the end of the week.Keeping exotic animals is considered a status symbol among some wealthy Pakistanis, despite the high fees associated with ownership.","Authorities launched a crackdown after a lion escaped from a house in Lahore and attacked a woman and two children.

ISLAMABAD: Swat Valley and Gilgit-Baltistan — key cradles of the Indus river — are battling deadly floods triggered by relentless monsoon rains and glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), exposing Pakistan’s weak climate governance and the fragility of its disaster response.At least 72 people have died nationwide, including 14 in Swat and 23 in Astore (Gilgit-Baltistan) where a passenger bus plunged into a swollen river. Another 25 people were rescued from the surging Indus near Shadi Khan in Punjab’s Attock district.Swat’s flash floods were triggered by a GLOF in Kalam Mitaltan area, while accelerated glacier melt in Gilgit-Baltistan has swelled rivers such as the Hunza, Kunjrab, and Shimshal Braldu. In both regions, roads, bridges, and homes have been swept away, leaving mountain communities stranded.“No early warning systems, no modern rescue equipment – Swat is left to drown, again,” said Ambreen Ali, a local activist, echoing growing public frustration.Once a prized alpine tourist destination, Swat continues to reel from its past under Taliban rule (2007–2009). Despite a military-led recovery and donor-funded rebuilding, this summer’s floods have damaged rebuilt infrastructure, including hotels in Kalam and Bahrain and the Mankial bridge, a lifeline for remote villages.In Gilgit-Baltistan, floodwaters threaten power lines and roads in Diamer, Skardu, and Astore, while downstream provinces fear the Indus’s surging flow. In Sindh, farmers worry that floods – exacerbated by dam releases upstream – will drown their fields.The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) blames a 67% rainfall deficit last winter for intensifying water stress. With only 150 cubic meters of per capita water storage, Pakistan is among the most water-insecure countries globally, retaining just 10% of its river flows.But it’s not just Pakistan that’s vulnerable.India, which shares the Himalayan watershed and the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) with Pakistan, faces similar climate pressures. The 2022 floods, which killed 1,700 in Pakistan and inundated Indian regions, underscored the shared ecological risks tied to glacial retreat and erratic monsoons.The IWT, signed in 1960, has come under renewed strain. India suspended the treaty on April 23, 2025 following a terrorist attack in Kashmir’s Pahalgam. This halted data-sharing on river flows, leaving Pakistan exposed during the monsoon season.Pakistan suspects India’s water infrastructure push – including the Shahpurkandi and Ujh dams – could further disrupt downstream flows. But India too faces its own water anxieties, including unilateral dam operations and growing glacier-related threats in its Himalayan catchments.Analysts warn that lack of coordination on flood management could have catastrophic consequences for both countries. Experts call for restoring data exchange under IWT, investing in joint watershed management, and building early warning systems. With over 3,000 glacial lakes in Pakistan alone, the risk of future GLOFs looms large.As Swat mourns its dead and Gilgit-Baltistan braces for more floods, the Indus – a lifeline for both nations – is turning into a symbol of shared peril.","At least 72 people have died nationwide, including 14 in Swat and 23 in Astore.

At least 72 people have been killed and over 130 injured in Pakistan as relentless monsoon rains and flash floods battered the country over the past ten days, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) said on Monday.Since June 26, casualties have been reported across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan provinces. The NDMA has urged local administrations to remain on high alert and advised tourists to steer clear of vulnerable areas, warning that continued rainfall could lead to further flooding and road blockages.Emergency services were already on heightened alert after a tragic incident last month in which 17 members of the same family were swept away by the Swat River.Thirteen bodies were recovered, including eight children, while four people were rescued. Footage of the family stranded on a rooftop and pleading for help sparked public outrage and criticism of the delayed rescue response.Many of the recent deaths were caused by collapsing walls and roofs, as well as sudden floods in low-lying areas.Officials are concerned that worsening weather conditions could mirror the devastating 2022 floods, which killed over 1,700 people and submerged nearly a third of the country.The NDMA has said it cannot rule out the possibility of similar large-scale disasters this year.With a population of more than 240 million, Pakistan remains one of the most climate-vulnerable nations in the world. Scientists warn that climate change is driving a rise in both the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, putting millions at risk.Rescue operations are ongoing, and authorities have called on the public to remain cautious as the monsoon season continues to intensify.",At least 72 people have been killed and over 130 injured in Pakistan as relentless monsoon rains and flash floods battered the country over the past ten days.

'Free Balochistan': Who is Tommy Robinson? Controversial far-right activist who gained support from Elon Musk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/free-balochistan-who-is-tommy-robinson-controversial-far-right-activist-who-gained-support-from-elon-musk/articleshow/122293045.cms,"Baloch Leader Declares Independence From Pak, Seeks India's Support On Global Stage

Who is Tommy Robinson?







British far-right activist Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, has drawn fresh attention online after he posted on X ""Free Balochistan"". The post, shared with his more than one million followers on X (formerly Twitter), is the latest in a series of controversial statements from the 42-year-old figure known for his inflammatory views, legal troubles, and vocal presence on social media.Tensions are running high in Balochistan following a violent crackdown by authorities on a peaceful rally in Hub Chowki. The protest, organised by the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC), was held to denounce the extrajudicial killing of Zeeshan Zaheer, a BYC member from Panjgur, allegedly targeted by a state-backed death squad.The BYC reports that a large number of women, children, and families of forcibly disappeared persons had joined the rally. Despite the peaceful nature of the protest, security forces responded with aerial firing, tear gas shelling, and mass arrests once the demonstration ended. Among those detained were four women — Sadiya, Samina, Aseela, and Mehtab — and human rights activist Abdullah Baloch. More than 20 hours later, their whereabouts remain unknown, with no legal proceedings initiated.Robinson rose to prominence in the UK as the founder of the English Defence League (EDL), a far-right, anti-Islam group notorious for staging violent protests between 2009 and 2013.His activism has long focused on immigration, Islam, and what he describes as the failure of British authorities to confront crimes like grooming gang abuse.Over the years, he has been jailed for assault (2005), mortgage fraud (2014), and previous contempt of court offences (2019), the latter for filming defendants during a grooming gang trial and potentially jeopardising judicial proceedings.Robinson portrays himself as a whistleblower silenced by the state, gaining significant online backing, including from Elon Musk earlier this year, who reinstated Robinson’s X account and has echoed his claims about establishment failures in prosecuting child sexual exploitation cases.Musk had also advocated for his release from jail in January saying, ""Why is Tommy Robinson in a solitary confinement prison for telling the truth? He should be freed and those who covered up this travesty should take his place in that cell.""","British far-right activist Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley- Lennon, has drawn fresh attention online after he posted on X ""Free Balochistan"" The post is the latest in a series of controversial statements from the 42-year- old figure known for his inflammatory views.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122293019,imgsize-10580,width-400,resizemode-4/122293019.jpg"
Pakistan's power struggle narrows to two men: Imran vs Munir,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-power-struggle-narrows-to-two-men-imran-vs-munir/articleshow/122283924.cms,"Imran Khan and Asim Munir (R)

Pakistan Offers Full Military Tribute To 'Kargil War Hero' Whose Body It Refused To Accept Earlier





ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s political battlefield has narrowed to two poles: Field Marshal Asim Munir , the army chief whose influence spans parliament, the judiciary and diplomacy, and Imran Khan , the jailed former prime minister who, despite his incarceration in Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail, remains the most potent political force in the country, commanding the street, the diaspora, and a digital army keeping his voice alive.This week, Khan issued a call for nationwide agitation after the 10th of Muharram, aiming to reignite mass mobilisation just as Field Marshal Munir stands at the peak of his institutional authority. The move comes amid growing public frustration over inflation, repression, and a system many believe has been engineered to exclude the electorate’s will.Two weeks ago, Munir met US President Donald Trump at the White House, a discreet engagement confirmed by diplomatic sources. According to insiders, Imran Khan’s fate and Pakistan’s internal political stability were among the topics discussed, particularly in light of pressure from the overseas Pakistani diaspora.Soon after, the Supreme Court awarded the PTI’s reserved seats to the ruling PML-N-PPP coalition, handing it a two-thirds supermajority in parliament — a legal outcome that critics say has effectively nullified the popular mandate from the Feb 2024 general elections.“It’s political elimination through judicial procedure,” said a senior legal analyst. “The system was rewritten to fit the result.”While Munir tours Washington, Riyadh and Beijing as Pakistan’s stabilising envoy, PTI’s political campaign has been pushed abroad, led by a vast online network of digital volunteers across the UK, North America and the Gulf. “You can erase a party from parliament, but not from memory,” said a PTI organiser in Birmingham. “We’ve made the diaspora the movement’s backbone.”PTI’s message – injustice, censorship, stolen mandate – is kept alive through platforms like YouTube, Telegram and X, forming a digital frontline that defies state control.Munir’s rising global stature – reinforced by high-profile diplomatic engagements – may yet prove to be a deceptive calm. History offers a cautionary echo: Pakistan’s military rulers from Ayub to Zia to Musharraf all basked in international legitimacy at their zeniths, only to be brought down by domestic discontent.With Khan’s post-Muharram agitation call threatening to spill onto the streets and economic despair combining with political anger, Munir’s firm grip on the state may soon face its first real stress test. What looks like consolidation could quickly unravel if the tide of public rage surpasses the system’s capacity to contain it.There is no serious civilian counterweight. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif holds office but not authority. The real contest is between Munir with unmatched institutional control, and Imran, the politician with unbroken public appeal.Field Marshal Munir may rule the state. But Imran Khan – even from a prison cell – continues to shape the struggle that could decide Pakistan’s political future.","Imran Khan remains the most potent political force in the country, commanding the street, the diaspora, and a digital army keeping his voice alive.

Pakistan building collapse: 27 dead in Karachi including 3 children; rescue efforts continue,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-building-collapse-27-dead-in-karachi-including-3-children-rescue-efforts-continue/articleshow/122281154.cms,"Pakistan Offers Full Military Tribute To 'Kargil War Hero' Whose Body It Refused To Accept Earlier





The death toll from the collapse of a five-storey residential building in Karachi’s Lyari area has risen to 27, according to officials quoted by Dawn on Sunday.Rescue teams continue to comb through the debris in search of survivors, days after the structure came crashing down near Lea Market on Fida Husain Shaikha Road.South deputy commissioner Javed Nabi Khoso said the rescue operation had continued overnight on Friday and was around 80 per cent complete by Saturday. Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan estimated that it would take another five to six hours to fully conclude the operation.Several individuals are still unaccounted for, though authorities say the exact number remains unclear as the search is ongoing.The Edhi Rescue Service confirmed that 27 bodies have been recovered so far, including nine women, 15 men and three children aged 13, 10 and one. Five people, among them three women, were also injured in the collapse. All victims were taken to Civil Hospital Karachi, and ten of the injured have since been treated and discharged.Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah said emergency teams were deployed swiftly after the incident and that the bodies have been returned to the victims’ families.He reaffirmed expectations that rescue efforts would conclude later in the day.Shah announced that a full investigation is underway, with committees already formed to examine the causes of the collapse. He revealed that over 480 buildings in Karachi’s older city areas, mostly in District South, have been declared dangerous.He also pledged government support for those displaced by the incident, promising assistance in securing alternative housing.The chief minister said the collapsed building appeared to be newly constructed and lacked the necessary approvals. He warned of strict action against those responsible for unauthorised construction and urged residents to confirm the clearance of buildings with the Building Control Authority before purchasing or renting.Acknowledging that financial struggles often force people into unsafe living conditions, Shah stressed the need for stronger enforcement and public awareness to ensure safety is not compromised.","The death toll from the collapse of a five-storey residential building in Karachi’s Lyari area has risen to 27, according to officials quoted by Dawn on Sunday.
