NEW DELHI: The West Bengal CID detained one person for his alleged involvement in the murder of Bangladesh MP Anwarul Azim Anar on Thrusday evening. Police suspect that the MP could have been ""lured' into a New Town flat by a woman and then murdered by contract killers .The detained person is a resident of an area in West Bengal near the international border with Bangladesh. The person had met one of the main suspects in the murder case, as mentioned by the officer.Further investigation is currently being conducted to determine the reason for the meeting between the two individuals and the topics they discussed. The officer mentioned that the identity of the detained person is not being disclosed.An initial investigation revealed that the Member of Parliament's close friend, who is a US citizen, had allegedly paid approximately Rs 5 crore to the individuals involved in the crime. This information was disclosed by a senior police officer.The friend of the Awami League MP owns a flat in Kolkata. He is probably in the US at present.Police mentioned that the apartment located in Kolkata's New Town area, where the Bangladeshi Member of Parliament was last observed entering, was leased to his friend by the owner, who is an employee of the excise department.""Investigation indicated that the Bangladeshi parliamentarian fell into a honey trap laid by a woman who was also close to the victim's friend. It seems that Anar was lured into the New Town flat by the woman. He said that they suspect he was murdered soon after he went to the flat.The CID is currently reviewing the CCTV footage . The footage captured Anar entering the flat accompanied by a man and a woman, as mentioned by the officer.""It was a well-planned murder. An old friend of the MP paid a huge amount of money, approximately Rs 5 crore, to the contract killers to carry out the crime. Further investigation is underway,"" he said.""In the CCTV footage, the politician was seen entering the flat with the two persons. The duo was later seen coming out and again re-entering the flat the next day but the MP was not seen again,"" the officer told PTI.Police mentioned that the pair was later observed exiting the apartment with a large trolley suitcase.Anar, who disappeared in Kolkata on May 13, was discovered dead. Bangladesh Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan mentioned on Wednesday that three individuals have been apprehended.The state CID is investigating the case. They have found blood stains inside the New Town flat. They also recovered several plastic bags, which they believe were used to dump the body parts.Circumstantial evidence suggests that the MP was strangled first, followed by his body being cut into multiple pieces according to the police.""We suspect that after killing Anar, the murderers mutilated the body, segregated the flesh from the bones and mixed those with turmeric powder to delay decomposition.""Then the body parts were probably put inside plastic bags as well as in the trolley bag and scattered at different locations. We also suspect that some parts were kept in a refrigerator and we have collected samples,"" the officer said, adding search for the body parts was underway.Messages were also sent from his mobile phone to a few of his contacts asking them ""not to contact him as he was travelling to Delhi'.""It seems these messages were sent from the MP's mobile phone to confuse his family members and friends and prevent them from launching a search for him... there is a possibility that these messages were sent after his murder,"" he said.The search for the missing MP started when Gopal Biswas, who is a resident of Baranagar in north Kolkata and knows the Bangladeshi politician, reported to the local police. The MP had arrived in Kolkata on May 12 for medical treatment.Anar stayed at the house of Biswas when he arrived.Biswas mentioned in his complaint that Anar departed from his residence in Baranagar on May 13 afternoon to see a doctor. Anar informed that he would return home for dinner.Biswas claimed that the Member of Parliament from Bangladesh has been unreachable since May 17.

It says it has no choice but to attack Rafah to root out the last battalions of Hamas fighters it believes are sheltering there.Residents and Palestinian media reported a series of strikes hitting roads and houses in the Shaboura neighbourhood in central Rafah shortly after the ICJ ruling was read out in The Hague.Israel launched its assault on Gaza following a Hamas-led attack on southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7 that killed 1,200 people and saw more than 250 hostages seized, according to Israeli tallies. Since then, Israel's incursion has killed more than 35,000 people, according to Gaza health authorities.Bodies recoveredIn northern Gaza, medics said at least five Palestinians were killed when houses were hit in Jabalia and more were believed to be trapped under rubble, but that the area could not be reached due to the intensity of the bombardment.The Israeli military said it had recovered the bodies of three hostages taken into Gaza after they were killed on Oct. 7.It said the bodies of Hanan Yablonka, Michel Nisenbaum and Orion Hernandez Radoux were recovered overnight in a joint operation by the army and the intelligence services in Jabalia.Israel says its twin goals in Gaza are bringing back the remaining hostages and destroying Hamas.""We will not stop fighting for their freedom,"" said military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari in a televised statement announcing the recovery of the three bodies. ""Every decent country would do the same.""Simultaneous Israeli assaults on the northern and southern edges of Gaza this month have caused a new exodus of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fleeing their homes, and have cut off the main access routes for aid, raising the risk of famine.Israel had said its forces cleared Jabalia, the largest of Gaza's eight historic refugee camps, months earlier in the war. But it returned there this month saying it needed to prevent Islamist militants regrouping, and the area has seen intense fighting in recent weeks.Residents said on Friday tanks had destroyed the local market and bulldozers continued to raze shops and property in Jabalia's narrow alleys. Hamas's armed wing said its fighters had engaged three tanks there.Tanks also advanced close to the nearby Kamal Adwan Hospital, where medics said Israeli fire had caused the suspension of operations at the last functioning medical facility in northern Gaza Strip.","Residents report intensifying aerial and ground bombardment in the south and centre of Rafah.

How Russia plans to counter deployment of US-made F-16s in Ukraine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/how-russia-plans-to-counter-deployment-of-us-made-f-16s-in-ukraine/articleshow/110404100.cms,"NEW DELHI: Moscow has hinted at the development of a new weapon designed to counter the deployment of F-16 fighter jets in Ukraine . The Russian media outlet Izvestia reported on May 24 that the new weapon could neutralize the effectiveness of the US-supplied jets, which have been considered a game-changer for Ukrainian forces.The specific details of the weapon remain undisclosed, but the report emphasizes Russia 's ongoing efforts to bolster its military capabilities in response to Western support for Ukraine. ""We have something to counter these aircraft,"" the report quotes an unnamed source as saying, highlighting the confidence within Russian defense circles.The announcement follows the recent decision by the United States and its allies to supply Ukraine with F-16 fighter jets, which are expected to significantly enhance Ukraine's aerial combat capabilities. The introduction of these jets has been a contentious issue, with Russia warning that it would escalate the conflict.In response to the F-16 deliveries, Russia has been intensifying its military activities and strategic planning. ""Russia has consistently demonstrated its ability to develop countermeasures to new threats,"" the report said, reflecting the country's determination to maintain its military edge.Military analysts suggest that the new weapon could be part of Russia's broader strategy to adapt to evolving battlefield dynamics. The F-16, a highly versatile multirole fighter, is known for its advanced avionics, agility, and combat effectiveness, making it a significant asset for Ukrainian forces. However, Russia's development of a countermeasure indicates its commitment to maintaining air superiority in the region.The deployment of F-16s to Ukraine marks a significant shift in the conflict, potentially altering the balance of power. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has expressed gratitude for the support, stating that the jets will play a crucial role in defending Ukrainian sovereignty. ""The arrival of F-16s will enhance our defensive and offensive capabilities,"" Zelenskyy said.However, Moscow views the delivery of these jets as a provocative act by the West. Russian officials have repeatedly warned that supplying advanced weaponry to Ukraine would lead to severe consequences. The new weapon, as teased by Russian media, is seen as a direct response to this escalation.The international response to Russia's announcement has been mixed. Some analysts believe that this move by Moscow is a strategic bluff aimed at deterring further Western intervention, while others see it as a genuine enhancement of Russia's military capabilities. NATO officials have expressed concern over the potential implications of this new development, urging for diplomatic solutions to prevent further escalation.","Russia has hinted at the development of a new weapon designed to counter the deployment of F-16 fighter jets in Ukraine.

Pat Ryder said.Austin and Dong, China's minister of national defense, are expected to meet during the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore next week, an annual meeting of defense ministers and government officials from more than 50 countries.The meeting also comes, however, as China has engaged in aggressive military drills around Taiwan, resulting in Taiwan scrambling jets and putting missile, naval and land units on alert Thursday.China launched the exercises after the island's new president, Lai Ching-te, was inaugurated and delivered a speech asking Beijing to cease its intimidation against the island but face the reality of its existence. Beijing rejected his remarks as advocating for separatism and launched the military drills.China claims Taiwan as part of its territory and vows to seize it by force if necessary to achieve unification. The US is obligated under federal law to ensure the island can defend itself.In the wake of those exercises, the US has cautioned China not to use Taiwan's political transition as a ""pretext or excuse"" for provocative or coercive measures, a defense official said. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide details that had not been made public.The two governments began to engage each other more after President Biden hosted Chinese President Xi Jinping in November in California and stressed the need to keep communications open.Dong is a former naval commander who was appointed in late December after his predecessor, Li Shangfu, was removed from office. Dong spoke with Austin by phone in April over issues including the war in Ukraine, freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, Taiwan and North Korea.Austin last met a Chinese defense minister in November 2022, when he and Wei Fenghe, then China's defense minister, were in Cambodia for a regional defense minister meeting.No US defense secretary has visited China since Jim Mattis visited in 2018.","Lloyd Austin and Admiral Dong Jun to meet at major defense conference in Singapore.

Prosecutors seek to bar Trump in classified files case from statements endangering law enforcement,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/prosecutors-seek-to-bar-trump-in-classified-files-case-from-statements-endangering-law-enforcement/articleshow/110411005.cms,"WASHINGTON: Federal prosecutors on Friday asked the judge overseeing the classified documents case against Donald Trump to bar the former president from public statements that ""pose a significant, imminent, and foreseeable danger to law enforcement agents"" participating in the prosecution.The request to US district judge Aileen Cannon follows a false claim by Trump earlier this week that the FBI agents who searched his home in August 2022 were ""authorized to shoot me"" and were ""locked & loaded ready to take me out & put my family in danger.""He was referring to the disclosure in a court document that was made public that the FBI, during the search, followed a standard use-of-force policy that prohibits the use of deadly force except when the officer conducting the search has a reasonable belief that the ""subject of such force poses an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to the officer or to another person.""The policy is routine and meant to limit the use of force during searches. Prosecutors noted that the search was intentionally conducted when Trump and his family were away and was coordinated with the Secret Service. No force was used.""The Government's request is necessary because of several intentionally false and inflammatory statements recently made by Trump that distort the circumstances under which the Federal Bureau of Investigation planned and executed the search warrant at Mar-a-Lago,"" prosecutors on special counsel Jack Smith's team wrote in asking that Cannon make a restriction on Trump's statements a condition of his release pending trial.""Those statements create a grossly misleading impression about the intentions and conduct of federal law enforcement agents - falsely suggesting that they were complicit in a plot to assassinate him - and expose those agents, some of whom will be witnesses at trial, to the risk of threats, violence, and harassment,"" they added.An attorney for Trump didn't immediately respond to a message seeking comment Friday night.Defense lawyers have objected to the government's motion, prosecutors wrote.Trump faces dozens of felony counts accusing him of illegally hoarding at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, classified documents that he took with him after he left the White House in 2021, and then obstructing the FBI's efforts to get them back. He has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.Trump faces four criminal cases as he seeks to reclaim the White House, but outside of the ongoing New York hush money prosecution, it's not clear that any of the other three will reach trial before the election.Asked Thursday at an unrelated event about the claim that the FBI intended to use force against Trump, Attorney General Merrick Garland said: ""That allegation is false, and it is extremely dangerous. The document that is being referred to in the allegation is the Justice Department's standard policy limiting the use of force. As the FBI advises, it is part of the standard operations plan for searches. And in fact, it was even used in consensual search of President Biden's home.""","Federal prosecutors ask judge to bar Donald Trump from making public statements.

The bombers, belonging to the eastern theatre command of the People's Liberation Army, formed multiple attack formations in waters east of Taiwan and conducted simulated attacks in coordination with naval vessels, Chinese state television CCTV reported.Meanwhile, Taiwan tracked numerous Chinese warplanes and navy vessels near its coast, coinciding with the second day of a significant exercise conducted by China's People's Liberation Army in response to the inauguration of Taiwan's new leadership.China has extensively advertised these maneuvers, showcasing Taiwan's encirclement by forces affiliated with the ruling Communist Party's military arm, the People's Liberation Army. A recent video presentation depicted animated Chinese forces closing in from all directions, effectively enclosing Taiwan within a circular target zone.Despite the situation, there was little evident concern among Taiwan's 23 million citizens, who have lived under the threat of Chinese invasion since the bitter and bloody civil war in 1949 led to the division between the two sides.Taiwan's parliament faced a dispute between political parties over procedural matters on Friday, yet daily activities continued as usual in the bustling capital of Taipei.According to the defense ministry, 49 warplanes, 19 navy vessels, and Chinese coast guard vessels were tracked. Of these, 35 planes crossed the median of the Taiwan Strait, the de facto boundary between the two sides, within a 24-hour period from Thursday to Friday.Marine and coast guard vessels, along with air and ground-based missile units, have been placed on high alert, particularly around the Taiwan-controlled islands of Kinmen and Matsu, situated just off the coast of China and distant from Taiwan's main island by approximately 160 kilometers (100 miles) across the Taiwan Strait.""Facing external challenges and threats, we will continue to maintain the values of freedom and democracy,"" Taiwan's new President Lai Ching-te told sailors and top security officials on Thursday as he visited a marine base in Taoyuan, just south of the capital, Taipei.Lai in his inauguration speech on Monday had called on Beijing to stop its military intimidation and said Taiwan was ""a sovereign independent nation in which sovereignty lies in the hands of the people"".China's military said that its two-day exercises around Taiwan were intended as punishment for separatist factions advocating independence.

The video has intensified calls for immediate international intervention to secure the release of the hostages and ensure their safety.According to a New York Post report, in the video, a Hamas militant is heard saying, ""Here are the girls who can get pregnant,"" a statement that underscores the degrading treatment of the captives. This quote has sparked particular outrage, with many calling it a blatant example of gender-based violence and exploitation.Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have condemned the actions of Hamas, labeling the treatment of the hostages as a gross violation of human rights. An IDF spokesperson declared, ""This inhumane treatment is unacceptable and must be met with swift and decisive action from the international community.""The release of this video comes at a time of heightened tensions and escalating violence in the region.

Ex-CIA officer accused of spying for China pleads guilty in a Honolulu courtroom,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ex-cia-officer-accused-of-spying-for-china-pleads-guilty-in-a-honolulu-courtroom/articleshow/110410639.cms,"HONOLULU: A former CIA officer and contract linguist for the FBI accused of spying for China for at least a decade pleaded guilty Friday in a federal courtroom in Honolulu.Alexander Yuk Ching Ma , 72, has been in custody since his arrest in August 2020. The U.S. Justice Department said in a court filing it amassed ""a war chest of damning evidence"" against him, including an hourlong video of Ma and an older relative - also a former CIA officer - providing classified information to intelligence officers with China's Ministry of State Security in 2001.The video shows Ma counting the $50,000 received from the Chinese agents for his service, prosecutors said.During a sting operation, he accepted thousands of dollars in cash in exchange for past espionage activities, and he told an undercover FBI agent posing as a Chinese intelligence officer that he wanted to see the ""motherland"" succeed, prosecutors said.The secrets he was accused of providing included information about CIA sources and assets, international operations, secure communication practices and operational tradecraft, charging documents said.As part of an agreement with prosecutors, Ma pleaded guilty Friday to a count of conspiracy to gather or deliver national defense information to a foreign government. The deal calls for a 10-year sentence, but a judge will have the final say at Ma's sentencing scheduled for Sept. 11. Without the deal, he faced life in prison.Ma was born in Hong Kong, moved to Honolulu in 1968 and became a U.S. citizen in 1975. He joined the CIA in 1982, was assigned overseas the following year, and resigned in 1989. He held a top secret security clearance, according to court documents.Ma lived and worked in Shanghai, China, before returning to Hawaii in 2001. He was hired as a contract linguist in the FBI's Honolulu field office in 2004, and prosecutors say that over the following six years, he regularly copied, photographed and stole classified documents. He often took them on trips to China, returning with thousands of dollars in cash and expensive gifts, such as a new set of golf clubs, prosecutors said.In court Friday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Ken Sorenson revealed that Ma's hiring as a part-time contract linguist was a ""ruse"" to monitor his contact with Chinese intelligence officers.The FBI had been aware of Ma's ties with the intelligence officers and ""made the determination to notionally hire the defendant to work at an FBI off-site location in Honolulu,"" the plea agreement said.In 2006, while Ma was living in Hawaii, Chinese intelligence officers sent him photos of people they were interested in, Sorenson said, and Ma contacted the co-conspirator relative and convinced him to reveal at least two of the identities.Ma, in pleading guilty, said everything Sorenson described is true. Ma said he had signed non-disclosure agreements that he knew would be in effect even after leaving the CIA and that he knew the information he was providing to the Chinese intelligence officials could harm the United States or help a foreign nation.In 2021, Ma's former defense attorney told a judge Ma believed he was suffering from the early stages of Alzheimer's disease and was having trouble remembering things.A defense motion noted that Ma's older brother developed Alzheimer's 10 years prior and was completely disabled by the disease. The brother is referred to as the co-conspirator in the indictment against Ma, but prosecutors didn't charge him because of his incompetency due to Alzheimer's, the motion said.The co-conspirator is now dead, Sorenson said in court Friday.Last year a judge found Ma competent and to not be suffering from a major mental disease, disorder or defect.Ma's plea agreement with prosecutors also says he will ""provide more detailed facts relating to this case during debriefings with Government representatives,"" and submit to polygraph examinations.""The defendant understands and agrees that his cooperation obligation represents a lifetime commitment by the defendant to the United States to cooperate as described in this agreement,"" the court document said.","Alexander Yuk Ching Ma, 72, has been in custody since his arrest in August 2020.

WASHINGTON: US defence secretary Lloyd Austin will undergo a medical procedure at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and will transfer power temporarily to his deputy, Pentagon press secretary Maj Gen Pat Ryder said in a statement. Austin is continuing to deal with bladder issues that arose in December following his treatment for prostate cancer , Ryder said.

The procedure he will undergo on Friday evening is elective and minimally invasive, ""is not related to his cancer diagnosis and has had no effect on his excellent cancer prognosis,"" the press secretary said.

Austin will transfer authority to Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks while he is indisposed, the Pentagon said.

Austin, 70, has had ongoing health issues since undergoing surgery to address a prostate cancer diagnosis. He spent two weeks in the hospital following complications from a prostatectomy. Austin faced criticism at the time for not immediately informing the president or Congress of either his diagnosis or hospitalization.

Austin was taken back to Walter Reed in February for a bladder issue, admitted to intensive care for a second time and underwent a non-surgical procedure under general anesthesia at the time.

The Pentagon has notified the White House and Congress, Ryder said.",US defence secretary Lloyd Austin will undergo a medical procedure at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.

Poll: Majority of Americans believe Trump is guilty in hush money trial,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/poll-majority-of-americans-believe-trump-is-guilty-in-hush-money-trial/articleshow/110405143.cms,"NEW DELHI: A CBS News poll has revealed that a majority of Americans believe former President Donald Trump is ""definitely"" or ""probably"" guilty of the crimes he is accused of in his ongoing New York trial. The trial, which has captured national attention, involves charges that have not been publicly detailed in the poll but relate to significant legal issues Trump is currently facing.According to the poll, 56% of respondents believe Trump is either definitely or probably guilty. This sentiment reflects a growing skepticism among the American public regarding Trump's legal battles and their potential outcomes. Despite these perceptions, Trump has consistently denied all allegations and maintains his innocence.In response to the poll results, Trump said, ""This is nothing more than a continuation of the witch hunt against me. They’ve been after me from day one because I stand up for the American people, and I will continue to fight these baseless charges.""The poll also highlights a partisan divide in opinions about Trump's guilt. While a substantial majority of Democrats believe Trump is guilty, Republicans are largely divided, with a significant portion standing by the former president. Among independents, a notable number also lean towards believing Trump is guilty.The trial's proceedings and the public's perception of them are likely to have significant implications for Trump's political future , particularly as he remains a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a potential candidate for the 2024 presidential election .Legal analysts suggest that the outcome of this trial, as well as the public's opinion on Trump's guilt, could influence the broader political landscape, affecting voter sentiment and party dynamics. The case continues to unfold, with both legal and public scrutiny intensifying as new developments arise.As the trial progresses, the American public remains divided on Trump's innocence or guilt, reflecting broader national divides on political and legal issues surrounding the former president.","A CBS News poll has revealed that a majority of Americans believe former President Donald Trump is ""definitely"" or ""probably"" guilty of the crimes he is accused of.

Hundreds of heatstroke cases reported in Pakistan amid intense heatwave,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/hundreds-of-heatstroke-cases-reported-in-pakistan-amid-intense-heatwave/articleshow/110381089.cms,"(With agency inputs)

NEW DELHI: Hospitals across Pakistan treated hundreds of heatstroke victims as an intense heatwave pushed temperatures above normal levels. Officials attribute the rising temperatures to climate change.Temperatures reached up to 49 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit) in Mohenjo Daro on Wednesday. The city, located in southern Sindh province, was severely impacted by climate-induced monsoon rains and floods in 2022. The heatwave is expected to persist for at least a week.Authorities have advised people to stay indoors, stay hydrated, and avoid unnecessary travel. However, many laborers say they must continue working to support their families.""Pakistan is the fifth most vulnerable country to the impact of climate change. We have witnessed above normal rains, floods,"" said Rubina Khursheed Alam, the prime minister’s coordinator on climate, during a news conference in Islamabad.Barakullah Khan, a civil defense official, advised people not to leave cooking gas cylinders in open areas and warned those living near fields about the risk of snakes and scorpions entering homes and storage spaces in search of cooler areas.Weather forecasters predicted that temperatures may rise to 55 degrees Celsius (131 degrees Fahrenheit) this month.Hospitals in the eastern city of Lahore and in the districts of Hyderabad, Larkana, and Jacobabad in Sindh province have reported treating scores of heatstroke patients.""The situation has been getting worse since yesterday, when people affected by heat started coming to hospitals in the Punjab province,"" said Ghulam Farid, a senior health official. Emergency response centers have been established at hospitals to treat heat-affected patients.The state-run ambulance service is now equipped with bottled water and ice to provide emergency treatment to heat victims.The United Nations children’s agency has called for measures to protect children from the heat. Sanjay Wijesekera, Unicef regional director for South Asia, warned that rising temperatures could put millions of children’s health at risk if they are not protected and hydrated.Heatstroke is a serious illness that occurs when body temperature rises too quickly, potentially causing unconsciousness, disability, or death.Pakistan recorded its wettest April since 1961, with more than double the usual monthly rainfall. Last month’s heavy rains caused fatalities and extensive damage to property and farmland.Daytime temperatures have soared as much as 8 degrees Celsius (46 degrees Fahrenheit) above the average May temperatures over the past 20 years, raising concerns about flooding in the northwest due to glacial melting.The 2022 floods caused significant damage in Sindh and Baluchistan provinces, resulting in 1,739 deaths nationwide.The heatwave is also affecting Pakistan's southwest and northwest regions. Schools in Punjab have been closed for a week.On Thursday, Save the Children announced that more than half of Pakistan’s school-age children, approximately 26 million, will miss a week of school due to the heatwave. The closure of schools in Punjab means 52% of the country’s students will be out of school.In Lahore, residents have been seen swimming in roadside canals to cool off. Despite contributing less than 1% to global carbon emissions, Pakistan is experiencing severe impacts of climate change.","Temperatures reached up to 49 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit) in Mohenjo Daro on Wednesday.

Subsequent interrogations led to the unraveling of the gang's illicit activities.One of the suspects, identified as Nisar, reportedly enticed children from gaming zones and transported them to the gang's hideout. There, the minors were allegedly subjected to sexual abuse and also trafficked to others.It was disclosed by the police that the gang predominantly targeted children aged between 12 to 14 years.Law enforcement authorities further elaborated that the suspects employed a strategy of wearing a helmet associated with an online motorcycle service to evade detection while transporting the children from one location to another, ARY News reported.Data collected by Sahil, an NGO dedicated to addressing child sexual abuse, reveals a disturbing trend: the majority of abusers are individuals known to the victims, such as acquaintances, neighbours, or even family members.Shockingly, religious teachers and clerics emerge as the primary perpetrators within institutional settings, surpassing even police officers, school teachers, or nuclear family members in the number of complaints filed against them, according to Dawn.Primary data remains limited and organisations rely on media reports and police complaints but the trend over the past 20 years shows the gender divide of abused girls in madrassas is slightly higher than that of boys ('Cruel Numbers').","Police in Karachi have dismantled a gang allegedly engaged in the sexual abuse of children. Three members of the gang have been apprehended, with an equal number of children recovered by law enforcement. The modus operandi involved enticing children with sums ranging from PKR 200 to PKR 300 before subjecting them to sexual exploitation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110359062,imgsize-892085,width-400,resizemode-4/110359062.jpg"
Weather forecasters warn Pakistanis to stay indoors ahead of new heat wave,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/weather-forecasters-warn-pakistanis-to-stay-indoors-ahead-of-new-heat-wave/articleshow/110317818.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Authorities in Pakistan on Tuesday urged people to stay indoors as the country is hit by an extreme heat wave that threatens to bring dangerously high temperatures and yet another round of glacial-driven floods .Pakistan's most populous province, Punjab, is shutting all schools for a week because of the heat, affecting an estimated 18 million students.""The sweltering heat will continue this month,"" said Zaheer Ahmed Babar, a senior official at the Pakistan Meteorological Department. He added that temperatures could reach up to 6 degrees Celsius (10.8 Fahrenheit) above the monthly average. This week could rise above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) in many parts of the country, Babar said.It's the latest climate-related disaster to hit the country in recent years. Melting glaciers and growing monsoons have caused devastating floods, at one point submerging a third of the country.Pakistan recorded its wettest April since 1961, with more than double the usual monthly rainfall, according to the national weather center. Last month's heavy rains killed scores of people while destroyed property and farmland, experts say the country witnessed heavier rains because of climate change .Pakistan is still trying to recover from $30 billion in losses caused by devastating climate-induced floods that killed 1,739 people in 2022.According to health officials, hospitals were instructed to set up emergency heatwave response centers so that those affected by the scorching temperatures could be quickly treated.Doctors say heatstroke is a serious illness that occurs when one's body temperature rises quickly because of sweltering heat, potentially causing some to fall unconscious. A severe heatstroke can cause disability or death.Some areas in Pakistan are also currently facing hours-long power outages.""We were without electricity for hours on Monday,"" said Ibrar Abbasi, who lives on the outskirts of Islamabad.Scientists have long warned that climate change, driven by the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation and certain agricultural practices, will lead to more frequent and prolonged bouts of extreme weather, including hotter temperatures.Babar said another intense heat wave will hit the country in June, when the temperature is likely to reach 45 degrees (113 Fahrenheit). He said people should drink a lot of water and avoid unnecessary travel. Farmers and other livestock owners should take measures to protect their animals during extreme heat, he said.However, many people, especially laborers and construction workers in the impoverished nation, ask how they can stay indoors as their families will suffer if they don't work.""I am not feeling well because of the stifling heat, but I have to work,"" said Ghulam Farid, who owns a small general store in Sheikhupra, a city in Punjab province.Construction workers were seen sitting near a road on the outskirts of the capital, Islamabad, hoping to get a job. Among them was Mohammad Khursheed, 52, who said he has noticed a change in the patterns of seasons.""I feel the heat even in the morning, but people say the temperatures will go up even further,"" he said.","Pakistan's most populous province, Punjab, is shutting all schools for a week.

NEW YORK: In perhaps the first acknowledgement of its kind on a global forum that the ""new India is a dangerous entity"", Pakistan 's Permanent Ambassador to the United Nations, Munir Akram said, invoking the alleged targeted and extra-judicial assassinations in his homeland and elsewhere.Pakistan's permanent representative at the world body also quoted from a report in a leading US daily to say the ""new India comes into your home and kills you"".Addressing the General Assembly on May 2, Akram said, ""Pakistan's foreign minister informed the Security Council, as well as the secretary general and the president of the General Assembly of India's campaign of targeted assassinations in Pakistan. This extra-territorial state terrorism is not limited to Pakistan. It has been extended to targeted killings of political opponents in Canada and attempted in the United States and probably in other countries.""""The Washington Post reported that Prime Minister Modi last week told his cheering supporters, and I quote, ""Today, even India's enemies know this is Modi. This is the new India. This new India comes into your home and kills you"". This new India is a dangerous entity, it is a net provider of insecurity, not security,"" Pakistan's permanent representative to the UN alleged.Earlier, top British daily, The Guardian, claimed in a report that the Indian government carried out assassinations of wanted individuals deep inside Pakistan as part of a ""wider strategy to eliminate terrorists living on foreign soil"".It said, citing intelligence sources, that targeted assassinations increased significantly in 2023, claiming India's involvement in the suspected deaths of about 15 people, ""most of whom were shot at close range by unknown gunmen"".Earlier, some countries in the West raised concerns over what they claimed were targeted killings on their soil at the behest of the Indian government.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused 'agents' allegedly in the employ of the Indian government of killing Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a pro-Khalistan leader and a designated terrorist by the country's elite National Investigation Agency (NIA), in 2020.However, India has dismissed the claim as 'absurd' and 'motivated'.Nijjar was shot and killed as he came out of a Gurdwara in Surrey in June last year. A purported video clip of his killing that reportedly surfaced in March, this year, showing Nijjar being shot by armed men in what was alleged to be a 'contract killing'.In a recent development in the Nijjar case, the Canadian Police arrested four Indian nationals for their alleged involvement in the killing of the separatist Khalistleader outside a gurudwara in British Columbia last June.Reacting to the arrests, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar denied receiving any evidence implicating Indian nationals' involvement in the killing in Canada of the India-designated terrorist.Responding to media queries, Jaishankar said, ""I also read that another arrest has been made. If that person is an Indian national, then usually by consular practice, you inform the government or the embassy of the country of origin. But beyond that, we have long maintained that if anything, any event in Canada, any violence in Canada, has any evidence or information which is relevant to be investigated in India, we are open to investigating it.""He emphasised that while any Indian national's arrest would usually prompt notification to the government or embassy, no specific evidence justifying investigation by Indian agencies has been received to date.""But to date, we have never received anything, which is specific and worthy of being pursued by our investigative agencies. And I'm not aware anything has changed in the last few days in that regard,"" the External Affairs Minister said at a media interaction at a seminar on Indian Capital Markets 'Roadmap for Viksit Bharat' at the National Stock Exchange (NSE) in Mumbai earlier.At a weekly media briefing, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), too, informed that Canada had not formally conveyed the arrests and India had not yet received any consular access request.On being asked about the fourth Indian arrested by Canada in connection with the Nijjar killing, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, ""We have seen reports of the fourth person being arrested. We have not been formally conveyed of it. So far, we have not received any consular access request as well.""Earlier, campaigning for the ongoing general elections in the country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a telling remark vis-a-vis its western neighbour, saying India does not send dossiers on terrorism anymore but eliminates terrorists in their own backyard.""Today, India doesn't send dossiers.(Today India strikes back at terrorists on their own turf),"" PM Modi said at a poll rally in Maharashtra's Latur.Expanding on the difference in how his government tackles terrorism as compared to previous Congress regimes at the Centre, Prime Minister Modi said the earlier approach of handing dossiers to Pakistan has been replaced by taking out the wanted terror conspirators on their own turf.At a separate rally, PM Modi doubled down on remarks made by the INDIA bloc leader Farooq Abdullah that Pakistan was not wearing bangles and was a nuclear-amed nation, saying, """" (I was told Pakistanis don't even have bangles, we will make them wear some)"".Addressing a public meeting in Muzaffarpur, PM Modi said, ""These (Congress and INDIA alliance) people are so afraid that they see Pakistan's atom bombs even in their dreams. Can such a government and leader run the country? They (INDI alliance leaders) say, ''. (i am told Pakistanis don't even have bangles...we will make them wear some. They are desperately crying out for wheat, they don't have electricity and now they don't even have bangles to wear.) Some leaders in the Opposition are even giving clean chits to the 26/11 accused.""""Some people are doubting the surgical strikes and air strikes (after the Uri and Pulwama terror attacks). These leaders want to weaken the morale of our forces and cast aspersions on our nuclear power. It seems like 'INDI alliance ne India ke khilaf supari le li hai' (INDI partners have taken out a contract against the country),"" PM Modi added.In the US, federal prosecutors earlier alleged the involvement of two Indian nationals, including a government employee, in a plot to murder Khalistani separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a Canadian also holding American citizenship, on its soil.According to the indictment of the US Justice Department, an Indian national, Nikhil Gupta, who is currently in custody, was charged with the murder-for-hire of Pannun. The US Justice Department claimed that an Indian government employee, who was not identified in the indictment filed, recruited Gupta to hire a hitman to allegedly assassinate Pannun, which was foiled by US authorities.India set up a high-level committee to probe the matter.","Pakistan's Permanent Ambassador to the United Nations, Munir Akram said, invoking the alleged targeted and extra-judicial assassinations in his homeland and elsewhere.

The upcoming election in Sri Lanka will have a major impact on the future of the island nation and human rights considerations for years to come, the global rights NGO said in a statement issued at the end of a five-day visit by its Secretary General Agnes Callamard to the country.The presidential election in Sri Lanka is scheduled to take place between mid-September and mid-October.""The visit has provided insights into many challenges that Sri Lanka is confronting 15 years after the end of the war (with the LTTE ),"" the statement said.Callamard visited the northeastern Mullaithvu district on Sunday to commemorate the fallen victims from the Tamil side to mark the 15th anniversary of the end of the final conflict.""A seemingly lack of political will, along with complacency in delivering justice prevents reconciliation,"" the statement said, calling on the international community to work with the island's authorities to secure truth and justice for all victims of the war and the ongoing human rights violations and lay the foundation for a freer and fairer Sri Lanka.Amnesty said during the visit, the focus had been centred on threats to civil society; freedom of expression; the right to peaceful protest; the use of anti-terror laws such as the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) to suppress dissent; harassment; intimidation; surveillance and obstacles to press freedom.It said the new legislation such as the Online Security Act and the proposed non-governmental organisation law are worrying evidence of the dangers faced by civil society in the country.The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) had run a military campaign for a separate Tamil homeland in the northern and eastern provinces of the island nation for nearly 30 years before its collapse in 2009.On May 18, 2009, the Sri Lankan Army declared victory with the discovery of the body of the dreaded LTTE leader Velupillai Prabakaran .Despite the passage of nearly 15 years since the end of the armed conflict and many decades since the earliest waves of enforced disappearances, Sri Lankan authorities are still failing to ensure accountability for these violations. Tamil groups claimed a large number of civilians had perished during the final battle.A report issued by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights ( OHCHR ) on Friday said the Sri Lankan government must take meaningful action to determine and disclose the fates and whereabouts of tens of thousands of people who have been subjected to enforced disappearance over the decades and hold those responsible to account.It called for renewed action by Sri Lanka at the domestic level to hold it to account through criminal justice. The report also called for the international community to be engaged with Sri Lanka for investigation and prosecutions for targeted sanctions.Sri Lanka maintains that OHCHR is not mandated by the member states to issue any such report.","There is seemingly a ""lack of political will"" in delivering justice to the many victims of Sri Lanka's three-decade-long internal armed conflict, Amnesty International says.

Why King Charles will limit his public appearances for next few weeks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/why-king-charles-will-limit-his-public-appearances-for-next-few-weeks/articleshow/110403302.cms,"NEW DELHI: King Charles III 's public appearances will be limited over the next six weeks, but not due to his ongoing cancer treatments. Following UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's announcement of an early parliamentary election on July 4, Buckingham Palace stated that the royal family would be canceling most public engagements until after the vote. This decision was made to prevent any actions that might shift focus away from the campaign.As a unifying head of state, King Charles will strive to fulfill his role during the election while adhering to the constitutional prohibition on political interference. Although the king's role in government is primarily ceremonial, it is intertwined with traditions that reflect the gradual transfer of royal powers to Parliament over the past eight centuries.The king's involvement in calling the election was limited to granting permission to dissolve Parliament early, a request made by Sunak. Technically, the king retains the power to refuse a dissolution request if he believes an election would be detrimental to the nation.However, no prime minister in modern times has been denied permission to dissolve Parliament, as ignoring this precedent ""would expose the monarch to allegations of political interference of an undemocratic nature, even if the intention of the refusal was to preserve the good functioning of democracy,"" according to the Institute for Government, an independent think tank.The current session of Parliament will be ""prorogued,"" or ended, on Friday based on an order that King Charles approved during a meeting of the Privy Council on Thursday at Buckingham Palace. The king will not attend the formal end of the session, a ceremonial affair where the speaker of the House of Commons and other members of Parliament will troop into the House of Lords to hear a speech written by the government.To ensure strict adherence to the rules barring the royal family from interfering in politics, especially during an election, the royals cannot campaign for candidates, endorse policies, or even express their political preferences. Consequently, Buckingham Palace announced that members of the royal family would postpone all engagements that ""may appear to divert attention or distract from theelection campaign ."" This led to the king canceling trips to a Bentley car factory and a community center assisting those facing financial difficulties.However, some engagements are considered above reproach, such as the king and queen's planned attendance at ceremonies marking the 80th anniversary of D-Day on June 6. Other engagements will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, according to the palace.The monarchy's primary role is to provide a unifying figurehead who is seen as above politics and can offer stability in challenging times. This is the first general election of King Charles' reign, while his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, oversaw 21 during her 70 years on the throne. As George Gross, a royal expert at King's College London, noted, elections are inherently moments of turbulence, and people look to the monarchy for continuity during these times. The head of state assumes a crucial role in maintaining stability and continuity, and the royals must refrain from any political involvement.","UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced an early parliamentary election on July 4. Buckingham Palace announced that the royal family would be canceling most public engagements. This decision was made to prevent any actions that might shift focus away from the campaign. The king's role in government is primarily ceremonial, but intertwined with traditions.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110403983,imgsize-1755636,width-400,resizemode-4/110403983.jpg"

No deportation flights to Rwanda before July 4 snap elections: UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/no-deportation-flights-to-rwanda-before-july-4-snap-elections-uk-prime-minister-rishi-sunak/articleshow/110389667.cms,"LONDON: UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said that no deportation flights to Rwanda will take place before the July 4 snap election, reported Al Jazeera.Sunak made this announcement during the first full day of campaigning on Thursday.The Labour Party which is currently maintaining a commanding 20-point lead in opinion polls, has promised to scrap the deportation plan if it comes in power.While speaking at a campaign event on Thursday, Sunak cast the policy as central to the political race, Al Jazeera reported.Earlier in April, Sunak announced that there would now, be no delay in the flights to Rwanda and has promised to start sending asylum seekers there within 10 to 12 weeks.British authorities commenced the detention of asylum seekers as part of the new initiative aimed at deporting them to Rwanda, with initial flights slated for departure as early as July.""We've started detaining people ... the flights are booked for July, airfields on standby, the escorts are ready, the caseworkers are churning through everything, so all that is happening, and if I'm re-elected as your prime minister, those flights will go to Rwanda,"" Sunak said.The deportation plan has been a flagship policy for Sunak since he took office in October 2022.He has continued to champion it even after the UK Supreme Court in November ruled the plan unlawful on the grounds that Rwanda could not be considered a safe third country, reported Al Jazeera.In response, Sunak signed a new treaty with the East African country and passed new legislation in June to circumvent the ruling. Nevertheless, more legal challenges remain possible.Earlier this month, Labour leader Keir Starmer vowed to trash the plan, which has already cost hundreds of millions of pounds, ""straight away"" upon taking office.However, the number of asylum seekers making the dangerous journey across the Channel has risen to record numbers so far in 2024.Starmer also introduced a separate plan to launch a new border enforcement unit and tap counter ""terror"" powers to reduce the number of smuggling people.Notably, immigration is expected to be one of the key issues in the election campaigns with the economy and the National Health Service's record waiting times also set to loom large, reported Al Jazeera.The UK Prime Minister's decision to call the vote months earlier than expected came as a shock to some members of his party, with 14 years of at times chaotic Conservative rule leaving many in the country disillusioned.Moreover, in opinion polls, Conservatives have lagged behind the Labour Party since Rishi Sunak replaced former Prime Minister Liz Truss following her resignation after just 44 days in office.","UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said that no deportation flights to Rwanda will take place before the July 4 snap election.
