Poll Do you agree with Jitan Ram Manjhi's plea for fairness in seat-sharing negotiations? Yes, it’s a reasonable request. No, he should demand more.

Rashmirathi

The Mahagathbandhan's not so 'dignified' proposal



What does Chirag want from NDA?



Tejashwi for CM, Tejashwi for CM not







A throwback to Nitish's flips but no flops



NEW DELHI: As Bihar gears up for another high-stakes assembly election, the political landscape is once again abuzz - not with Nitish Kumar 's next move - but with poetry, posturing, and power plays. From poetic pleas for justice to sharp rebukes over “dignity” in seat offers, alliance partners across the spectrum are flexing muscles and testing loyalties.In the NDA camp, Union minister Jitan Ram Manjhi has invoked Dinkar’s Rashmirathi to press for a fair share, while in the Mahagathbandhan, Left allies are growing restless over what they deem “insulting” proposals. Amid the flurry of negotiations, one thing is clear — in Bihar’s shifting sands of coalition politics, every seat counts, and every word carries weight.Yet, beneath the poetic appeals and fiery rejections lies a deeper churn: the absence of a clear chief ministerial face, the confusion over leadership within alliances, and the persistent tug-of-war between old guards and rising heirs.Union minister and former Bihar chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi struck a poetic yet pointed note as he expressed his seat-sharing expectations. Hinting that his party, the Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM), had once aspired to contest half of the state’s 243 constituencies, Manjhi said he was ready to settle for 15 seats in the spirit of coalition unity.Taking inspiration from Ramdhari Singh Dinkar’s, he invoked Lord Krishna’s appeal for justice before the Mahabharata war, writing on X, “Ho Nyay Aagar To Aadha Do” — a plea for fairness seemingly directed at the BJP.Continuing in the same poetic vein, Manjhi added that if full justice was not possible, HAM would be content with “15 villages” — a metaphor for 15 constituencies — and would not “raise arms against kin,” underscoring his commitment to the NDA alliance. The statement came shortly after BJP leaders Dharmendra Pradhan and Vinod Tawde visited his residence to deliberate on seat-sharing.After putting up quite a show in the last assembly elections, the CPI (Marxist-Leninist) Liberation did not find the proposal to contest on 19 seats ""dignified"" enough. In 2020, CPI (ML) won 12 seats of the 19 contested.This time, it demanded 40 seats initially, later bringing it down to 30, PTI reported citing a party source. The party has kept ""all its options open"" in case its demands are rejected.""CPI(ML) rejected the offer as it was not a dignified proposal, and we are going to make a fresh proposal to fight around 30 seats. We are reducing the number of seats by almost 25 per cent,"" the source said.In 2020, RJD contested 144 seats and won 75, while the Congress contested 70 seats and won 19.Meanwhile, Congress’ central election committee is set to meet today to finalize its candidates.Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) president Chirag Paswan has made headlines for calling out Bihar administration, ruled by ally Nitish Kumar's JDU, on rising crime levels and his recent war cry of ""Abki baari, yuva Bihari,"" as unemployment remains major poll attack agenda of the opposition this time.It had left the NDA in 2020 over disagreements with chief minister Nitish Kumar, dealing a significant blow to the JD(U), despite managing to win only one of the more than 135 seats it contested.This time, while he has explicitly ruled out any CM ambitions, his party is eyeing specific constituencies considered favorable and has requested a few assembly seats in each of the five Lok Sabha constituencies it won in 2024, PTI reported citing a party source.Whether RJD patriarch is in ""dilemma between his sons and daughters"" or not, Congress has clearly stated its stance. Tejashwi Yadav could be RJD's CM face, but not INDIA bloc's, at least not for now.""Tejashwi Yadav may be CM face for RJD but INDIA bloc's CM face will be decided collectively,"" Congress leader Udit Raj said.This came after Tejashwi posted on X, a poster which implied him as the CM face: ""When Tejashwi becomes the CM, none of our brothers and sisters in Bihar household would be unemployed.""BJP was quick to catch on to this mocking Tejashwi saying that while ""he called Rahul Gandhi PM several times but Rahul Gandhi did not call him (CM candidate).""""He is presenting himself but people of his alliance are not saying the same. He called Rahul Gandhi PM several times but Rahul Gandhi did not call him (CM candidate). Let alone the alliance, now the situation is different even within the family. Lalu Yadav is in dilemma between his sons and daughters. There is a crisis in the family,"" BJP MP Sudhanshu Trivedi said.In the 2020 Bihar elections, Nitish Kumar led the NDA to a 125-seat majority. In August 2022, he broke with the BJP to form a government with the RJD-Congress-led Mahagathbandhan and became a key figure in the INDIA bloc.However, in January 2024, ahead of the Parliamentary polls, Kumar returned to the NDA, which now includes JD(U), BJP, Chirag Paswan’s LJP (Ram Vilas), Jitin Manjhi’s Hindustan Awami Morcha, and Upendra Khushwaha’s RLSP.This time, the NDA faces the INDIA bloc, led by Tejashwi Yadav, along with Congress, Left parties, Mukesh Sahani’s VIP, and newcomer Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj.Well, there's a saying in Bihar. No matter the poll outcome, the winner is always Nitish Kumar. Let's see if it holds true this time.","In Bihar, the political landscape is abuzz with poetry, posturing, and power plays.

Ladakh Statehood Violence: BJP Blames Congress While Sonam Wangchuk Says Gen-Z Led The Protests

SRINAGAR: The Leh Bar Association on Wednesday demanded Rs 1-crore compensation each for the families of four people killed in the September 24 firing in Leh and called for an impartial judicial inquiry headed by a retired Supreme Court judge into the incident.“All four victims belonged to poor families. Three were young, and the fourth was an ex-serviceman who had fought for the country in the 1999 Kargil War. We expect the government to provide adequate compensation,” Bar president Mohammad Shafi Lassu said at a press conference in Leh.“In Ladakh’s history, this is the first such incident. The deceased belonged to underprivileged sections,” Lassu said, while seeking interim cash compensation along with a government job for one member of each of the four families.He said the Bar supports the Leh Apex Body and Kargil Democratic Alliance’s demand for a Supreme Court judge-led probe. “It would signal that the government stands for a healing touch,” he said.Lassu said arrests have continued since Sept 24. “Even today, two people were arrested. Yesterday also, two persons were taken into custody,” he said, adding that they have filed bail applications on their behalf.He said of the 39 people arrested on Sept 24, bail has been granted to 38 so far.“Subsequently, around 40 more people have been arrested, and we are pleading their cases in court.”Lassu said the Bar is appealing to the government to stop these arrests. “We are Indian nationalists. Despite that, one of our leaders, Sonam Wangchuk, was arrested and lodged in Jodhpur. It is painful for us. These arrests should stop now,” he said.On September 24, police and paramilitary forces allegedly opened fire on protesters after their demonstration turned violent, killing four people and injuring more than 70.The protesters were demanding Sixth Schedule status and statehood for Ladakh. The Sixth Schedule status, enshrined in the Indian Constitution, aims to protect the rights and distinct cultural identities of tribal populations, ensuring their self-governance through autonomous district councils (ADCs).After the violence, authorities in Leh imposed curfew-like restrictions, suspended mobile internet, and arrested more than 60 people.The protests erupted while environmental activist Sonam Wangchuk, a member of the Leh Apex Body, was on a 35-day hunger strike at Martyrs’ Park that began on September 10 to press for restoration of “democratic rights.”After the clashes turned fatal, Wangchuk called off his fast. He was taken into custody on Sept 26 under the National Security Act.While the Ladakh administration has ordered a magisterial inquiry into the violence, the Leh Apex Body and the Kargil Democratic Alliance have rejected it, reiterating their demand for a judicial probe by a retired SC judge. The two groups also withdrew from talks with the Union home ministry’s high-powered committee scheduled for October 6, seeking Wangchuk’s release and an impartial investigation.","Leh Bar Association demands Rs 1-crore compensation each for the families of four people killed in the September 24 firing in Leh.

'India wanted PoK back': Tejashwi says PM Modi yielded to Trump; asks 'why was ceasfire called',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-wanted-pok-back-tejashwi-says-pm-modi-yielded-to-trump-asks-why-was-ceasfire-called/articleshow/124387999.cms,"NEW DELHI: Hours after Prime Minister Narendra Modi called out the UPA government for staying silent after the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Tejashwi Yadav on Wednesday fired salvos at PM Modi , accusing him of agreeing to a ceasefire with Pakistan following a ""single tweet from US President Donald Trump"".Tejashwi claimed that the Prime Minister shattered public hopes by agreeing to a ceasefire with Pakistan after Operation Sindoor “We would have been really happy, and we had hopes from our security forces, to get back PoK, but I don't know why the PM agreed on a ceasefire. The ceasefire occurred after a single tweet from the US President,” Tejashwi said.“The PM is upset at this. The hopes we had from the PM have shattered,” he added.Earlier in the day, PM Modi said that Congress should clarify who prevented India’s military response after the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack.“A Congress leader, who has also been Union Home Minister, has said that a country prevented India's military retaliation post-26/11 Mumbai terror attack in 2008. The party should clarify,” PM Modi said.“This weakness of Congress strengthened terrorists. The nation has the right to know who stopped India from going ahead with a military retaliation after the Mumbai terror attack,” he added.“For us, nothing is more important than the safety and security of our nation and its citizens,” Modi said, referring to Operation Sindoor launched after the Pahalgam terror attack.This comes days after former Union home minister P Chidambaram, in an interview, recounted that he was inclined towards retaliatory action against Pakistan after the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks but was ultimately persuaded against it.Chidambaram said the decision-making process of the Manmohan Singh-led government was shaped by international diplomatic pressure, particularly from the United States.“It did cross my mind that we should do some act of retribution. I did discuss it with the Prime Minister and other people who mattered. The PM had discussed this matter when the attack was going on, I can surmise. And the conclusion was largely influenced by the MEA and the IFS that we should not physically react to the situation but employ diplomatic means,” he said.“The conclusion was reached amid pressure from the world that was descending upon Delhi to tell us not to start a war,” he added. Chidambaram specifically mentioned that then-US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice had travelled to New Delhi to meet him and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, urging India not to retaliate militarily.","Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Tejashwi Yadav accused PM Modi of agreeing to a ceasefire with Pakistan following a ""single tweet from US President Donald Trump"" Earlier in the day, PM Modi said that Congress should clarify who prevented India’s military response after the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124388030,imgsize-851007,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

Bail rejected to doctor who prescribed ‘killer’ syrup

BHOPAL: The first cases of children’s deaths in Madhya Pradesh after consuming cough syrup were reported on September 3, but it was only on September 16 that the administration recognised the severity of the situation and began a survey to check children’s health in Parasia block of Chhindwara district.The exercise gained pace two days later, after Nagpur hospitals alerted authorities about multiple child deaths due to renal failure. However, medicine samples were collected only after September 26, when a biopsy report from Nagpur’s Government Medical College and Hospital revealed “acute tubular injury” in one of the deceased children.Officials said during the initial public hearings, the administration came across several similar cases of renal failure among local children. An alert on September 18 from Metropolitan Surveillance Unit, a centralised public health facility to monitor, control and prevent disease outbreaks, further strengthened suspicion, prompting intensified screening. “At that time, the exact reason was not known, but the pattern suggested a possible toxin-induced illness,” said an official.A team from the state headquarters was sent to Parasia, and biological samples were dispatched to NIV Pune, which ruled out viral infections.The Nagpur biopsy report on September 24 confirmed that the deaths were due to renal failure, though the reason for kidney damage remained uncertain. The rapid progression of symptoms indicated chemical poisoning.Joint teams from the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation and MP Food and Drugs Administration collected syrup samples between September 26 and 29. Nineteen medicines used for the affected children were tested. Initial reports on October 1 and 3 found all samples of standard quality, but subsequent tests revealed that Coldrif cough syrup was substandard.Two more syrups — Respifresh TR and Relife — were also found below standards. Following confirmation from Tamil Nadu that Coldrif contained 48% diethylene glycol (DEG), a highly toxic chemical causing acute kidney failure, a state-wide ban was imposed on October 4.A district court in MP on Wednesday rejected bail to Dr Pravin Soni, the government pediatrician accused of prescribing contaminated cough syrup to children during his private practice.","The first cases of children’s deaths in Madhya Pradesh after consuming cough syrup were reported on September 3.

‘Evidence of CCTV footage seems a fictional creation’

NEW DELHI: Observing that courts cannot yield to public sentiment and external pressures and punish an accused merely on moral convictions or conjectures, the Supreme Court set aside on Wednesday the conviction of a man on death row for the rape and murder of a seven-year-old girl in Chennai in 2017.It said that the accused was made a scapegoat by the police.SC said the prosecution miserably failed to prove the case and the trial court as well as Madras HC glossed over patent infirmities and loopholes in the prosecution's case and wrongly convicted the man.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath, Sanjay Karol and Sandeep Mehta noted that the primary evidence of the so-called CCTV footage, in which the accused was allegedly captured, was not available on record and seems to be a fictional creation by the investigating officers to somehow trap the appellant.""It seems that the investigation officers were intentionally trying to screen the truth from being brought on record and washed their hands of the matter, by making the appellant, a scapegoat,"" the judgment said.Though the bench said that the offence was very horrible as a seven-year-old girl was raped and smothered, it said that there was no credible evidence against the accused and the court was left with no option but to let him off.""We cannot ignore or bypass the fundamental principle of criminal jurisprudence that the prosecution is duty-bound to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. The onus is heavier in a case based purely on circumstantial evidence. However, regrettably, the prosecution has miserably failed to do so in the instant case..."" the bench said.""While it is acknowledged that the acquittal of an individual involved in a heinous crime can lead to societal distress and cause grave anguish to the victim's family, the legal framework does not permit the courts to punish an accused person based merely on moral convictions or conjectures,"" it said.","SC said the prosecution miserably failed to prove the case and the trial court as well as Madras HC glossed over patent infirmities and loopholes in the prosecution's case.

Hazratbal Plaque Vandalism Row: BJP Demands Action; Omar Abdullah Questions Use Of Emblem At Dargah

SRINAGAR: PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti on Wednesday accused Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah of failing to protect land and dignity of the people by sitting idle on Land Grant Rules, 2022, which has barred the renewal of the leases of hotels and other institutions, risking their eviction and government takeover.She said her party will introduce Jammu and Kashmir Land Rights and Regularisation Bill, 2025, termed “Anti-bulldozer Bill"", in the assembly session beginning on Oct 23 to undo the effects of the 2022 rules.The proposed bill, the former CM, said, aims to regularise land holdings of individuals, families, and institutions who have been in continuous possession of the land for over 30 years, thereby granting them ownership rights, preventing arbitrary evictions, and ensuring social and economic stability across the state.“Nearly 60 hotels in Gulmarg, including heritage establishments such as Nedous and Highlands Park, have received takeover notices from Gulmarg Development Authority... The CM can take many decisions without citing interference from the LG, but he is doing nothing despite enjoying an absolute majority,” she told a presser.The PDP chief said even after completing a year in office, the Omar government has not framed a policy on lease renewal and land regularisation, creating deep uncertainty that has hurt tourism, local employment, and investor confidence in Kashmir’s hospitality sector.“Despite repeated assurances to protect the land rights of the people of Jammu and Kashmir, no concrete policy or legal stance has been taken,” Mehbooba added.In a separate presser, J&K assembly leader of opposition and BJP functionary Sunil Sharma accused the CM of talking only about restoring statehood. “Do you want statehood to become a tool to justify the killing of innocent Kashmiris?” Sharma asked.","Mehbooba Mufti accuses Omar Abdullah of failing to protect land and dignity of the people by sitting idle on Land Grant Rules, 2022.

Kumar took PSO's pistol, saying he had 'some work to do'

CHANDIGARH: Haryana ADGP Y Puran Kumar (52), known as an outspoken IPS officer who flagged irregularities, including alleged caste bias, in his own department, was found dead from a gunshot to the head at his Chandigarh residence Tuesday afternoon.The incident happened a day before he was to take up his new assignment as head of Police Training Centre, Sunaria.Police said Kumar, a 2001-batch IPS officer, shot himself with his gunman's service revolver in the soundproofed basement of his brother-in-law's house in Sector 11. According to a police release, a will and nine-page ""final note"" left by the ADG were recovered along with the weapon. Sources said the note named a few serving and retired IPS officers but didn't divulge its content.His wife, IAS officer Amneet P Kumar - civil aviation secretary and commissioner & secretary, women and child development dept in Haryana govt - was in Japan as part of a delegation.A native of Andhra, Haryana ADGP Y Puran Kumar belonged to the Scheduled Caste community. He held a BE-computer science degree and was an IIM-Ahmedabad alumnus. He repeatedly challenged his own department, not hesitating to move court, and had once complained against former Haryana DGP Manoj Yadava, accusing him of discrimination.He was last posted as IG-Rohtak Range before being transferred to the training centre on Sept 29. He went on leave and was due to join his new posting on Wednesday.Investigators are struggling to establish a timeline since the basement, which Kumar had converted into his office, was soundproof.

On October 8, Mike Florio of NBC Sports reported that New Orleans Saints defensive end Cameron Jordan was the latest high-profile victim of a home burglary last month. The incident occurred on September 14, when the Saints hosted the San Francisco 49ers at the Superdome. Two men allegedly broke into Jordan’s home and stole several expensive items. No one was at home during the invasion. On October 7, Jordan tweeted, “Yah that Sunday sucked… the most important things,my family, was and is safe,” referencing WDSU reporter Travers Mackel’s tweet.According to Travers Mackel’s WDSU report on X, Cameron Jordan’s home was burglarized on the same day the Saints played the 49ers in September. The Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office later arrested two suspects. Mackel shared this news by tagging NFL Insider Adam Schefter and linking to WDSU’s article on the incident's latest update.WDSU’s Investigative Reporter, Cassie Schirm, reported that the Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office arrested 28-year-old Donald Robinson of Stockbridge, GA, and 19-year-old Jadon Brown of Conyers, GA, in connection with the burglary.

Rapid health decline and fatal complications following cosmetic procedure



Legal battle and allegations raise concerns over cosmetic procedure oversight







Brazilian social media influencer Adair Mendes Dutra Junior, widely known as Junior Dutra, has died at the age of 31 following severe, unexpected complications from a cosmetic procedure. Known for his vibrant social media presence, creative lifestyle content, and engaging personality, Junior had gained a large, loyal following on Instagram. His untimely death has sent shockwaves through the Brazilian beauty community, social media circles, and among his over 100,000 devoted followers, many of whom expressed grief, disbelief, and heartbreak across multiple platforms.The tragedy unfolded after he underwent a popular cosmetic procedure called the “fox eyes” surgery, which aims to lift, reshape, and elongate the outer corners of the eyes for a more striking, model-like appearance. What was intended as a simple beauty enhancement turned fatal, tragically highlighting the potential risks, hidden dangers, and lack of regulation surrounding trendy cosmetic procedures increasingly sought after by influencers worldwide.Junior Dutra reportedly underwent the fox eyes procedure in March, performed by celebrity dentist Fernando Simionato Garbi. The influencer had publicly shared videos documenting the procedure, later revealing significant swelling, bruising, and redness around his eyes.Following the treatment, Junior developed a serious infection, which persisted despite dermatological care. In an interview with Brazilian outlet Feed TV, just a month before his death, he shared his deteriorating health: “I didn’t expect it to get this bad.” He described frequent hospital visits as he struggled to recover from post-procedure complications.This situation underscores a critical point: even procedures that appear minimally invasive or cosmetic can carry severe health risks if complications arise.The fox eyes or cat eyes surgery has surged in popularity in recent years, inspired by celebrities like Bella Hadid and Kendall Jenner. The procedure is designed to create an almond-shaped, lifted eye by raising the outer corners, giving a youthful and striking appearance.According to the American Board of Cosmetic Surgery (ABCS), several methods can achieve this look, including:Despite their popularity, these treatments are not risk-free. The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) warns that complications can include:The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also cautioned against the use of PDO threads for eyebrow or eyelid lifts, noting potential for permanent disfigurement, severe swelling, and long-lasting pain.Medical experts emphasise the importance of monitoring for early warning signs of complications. Post-procedure symptoms that should not be ignored include:To minimise risks, specialists recommend:Junior Dutra’s health reportedly worsened rapidly in his final days. His close friend Gean Souza told Brazilian magazine Quem that he began experiencing shortness of breath and extreme weakness. As reported by The US Sun, on October 3, Junior was rushed to a public hospital in São Paulo after severe respiratory distress. Despite emergency care, he could not be saved. His sudden passing left fans and the online beauty community in shock, illustrating how quickly post-procedure complications can escalate.Adding further complexity to the tragedy, Junior had filed a police complaint prior to his death. Legal documents obtained by Brazilian outlet Portland Leo Dias reveal that Junior accused Garbi of performing medical procedures outside his professional license and impersonating a doctor. The complaint included charges of illegal medical practice, fraud, and causing serious bodily harm. Junior had also requested an official investigation by the 15th Police District of São Paulo.Garbi, through legal representatives, denied any wrongdoing and maintained that his procedures were performed legally and safely under proper supervision. The case highlights the need for stronger regulatory oversight in cosmetic procedures, particularly those fueled by social media trends.","Adair Mendes Dutra Junior, widely known as Junior Dutra, has died at the age of 31 following severe, unexpected complications from a cosmetic procedure.

Prosecutors are awaiting toxicology results, which could be crucial in the ongoing criminal case. The incident, captured on surveillance, has led to felony charges and a civil lawsuit, potentially impacting Sanchez's broadcasting career.

Prosecutors focus on toxicology report as key evidence emerges

The violent altercation and eyewitness accounts paint a troubling scene



Former New York Jets quarterback and current FOX Sports analyst Mark Sanchez is facing mounting legal pressure following a violent incident in Indianapolis that left a 69-year-old truck driver seriously injured. What began as a chaotic early-morning confrontation has evolved into a full-blown criminal case, with prosecutors now awaiting toxicology results that could determine the next steps in Sanchez’s legal future.Marion County Prosecutor Ryan Mears told NBC News that the upcoming toxicology report could prove vital to understanding what fueled Sanchez’s behavior that night. “We’re very interested in what the toxicology reports are going to reveal,” Mears said, confirming that his office is working closely with investigators.“The good thing about this case is that there is surveillance footage all up and down that alley, so we do have a pretty clear picture of what took place,” he added. The footage reportedly shows Sanchez sprinting before his violent encounter with Tole, further raising concerns about his state of mind.Sanchez, who posted a $300 bond, has yet to make a public statement. FOX Sports, his current employer, has not commented on whether he will continue appearing on air.The altercation unfolded near a downtown Indianapolis hotel loading dock, where Sanchez reportedly approached truck driver Perry Tole, who was attempting to back up his vehicle. According to police reports, Sanchez appeared agitated and possibly under the influence when the encounter turned physical. The confrontation ended with Tole sustaining a deep facial wound and neck trauma, injuries that required immediate medical attention.Tole has since filed a civil lawsuit against both Sanchez and FOX Sports, citing “emotional distress, permanent scarring, and negligence.” Witnesses at the scene described Sanchez as “slurring his speech” and “smelling of alcohol.” Surveillance footage from multiple cameras appears to corroborate the victim’s version of events, showing Sanchez “running erratically up and down the alley” before initiating contact.Prosecutors have since upgraded the charges from a misdemeanor to a Level 5 felony for battery resulting in serious bodily injury, a charge that carries a potential prison sentence of up to six years.Also Read: Prosecutor calls Mark Sanchez stabbing incident ‘completely unnecessary’ as truck driver faces permanent scarring As both the criminal and civil cases advance, the toxicology results could determine whether Sanchez faces a lengthy legal battle or a possible fall from grace that could end his broadcasting career altogether.","Prosecutors are awaiting toxicology results, which could be crucial in the ongoing criminal case.

How it unfolded



‘Israel cannot fight the world Bibi'

What it means

Two years of Gaza war





Israel and Hamas agreed on Thursday to begin the first phase of a Gaza ceasefire aimed at ending the conflict that has caused heavy casualties, widespread destruction, and a humanitarian crisis.""I am very proud to announce that Israel and Hamas have both signed off on the first Phase of our Peace Plan,"" US President Donald Trump said on his Truth Social platform.Donald Trump was holding a roundtable event with conservative influencers about Antifa late on Wednesday when US secretary of state Marco Rubio , standing in the back corner of the White House's Blue Room, caught his eye.He had news for Trump, he said, but it would have to wait until after the media left. Then Rubio passed the president a note, news agency Associated Press reported.Nearly two hours later, Trump posted on Truth Social that a deal had been struck.While the announcement played out publicly, most of Trump’s work had taken place behind the scenes as he pressured Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and sought support from Arab leaders. Hoping to secure a Nobel Peace Prize and strengthen his legacy, Trump took a more assertive line than his earlier unconditional backing of Israel.When he hosted Netanyahu at the White House on September 29 to unveil his 20-point peace plan, Trump declared that if Hamas did not accept it, Israel would have his ""full backing to finish the job"" and destroy the group. But the plan had already been shaped through consultations with Arab and Muslim leaders at the United Nations.Netanyahu objected to parts of the proposal, especially references to a potential Palestinian state. Trump was angered by an Israeli strike in Qatar during sensitive negotiations and used Arab outrage to bring regional actors on board. He then compelled Netanyahu to call Qatar’s leader from the Oval Office to apologize, a moment captured in a White House photo showing Trump holding the phone as Netanyahu read from a note.Trump gave Hamas a deadline of October 5 to agree to the deal or face ""all hell."" Hamas responded by highlighting Trump’s promise to secure the release of all hostages in Gaza, a cause he had publicly championed. Trump claimed victory and reposted Hamas’s statement, despite the group not agreeing to all terms.He later told Axios news outlet that he had said to Netanyahu, ""'Bibi, this is your chance for victory. He's got to be fine with it. With me, you got to be fine.'""In an interview with ""Hannity"" on Fox News, Donald Trump recounted his phone call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after announcing the deal.""I spoke to Bibi Netanyahu just a little while ago,"" Trump said. ""He called. He said, ‘I can’t believe it. Everybody is liking me now,’ meaning him. I said, ‘More importantly, they are loving Israel again,’ and they really are. I said, ‘Israel cannot fight the world Bibi, they cannot fight the world.’ And he understands that very well. So it’s amazing the way it’s all come together.""Israeli Ambassador to the US Yechiel Leiter told CNN that living hostages held by Hamas would be released on Sunday or Monday — with a 72-hour clock for Hamas to make the release beginning once the Israeli Cabinet meets, Thursday afternoon or evening, to approve the list of Palestinian prisoners to be released in the agreement. “We hope it leads to a complete cessation of hostilities and a rebuilding of Gaza for the sake of the Gazans and for the sake of Israel,” he said.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would convene his government on Thursday to approve the agreement, calling it a ""great day for Israel."" He added that he would bring the hostages home ""with God's help"" and thanked Trump, without giving details.Hamas, in its statement, urged Trump and the guarantors of the agreement to ensure that Israel ""fully implement the agreement's requirements and not allow it to evade or delay.""Donald Trump made the announcement of the agreement on his Truth Social platform, saying all of the hostages held in Gaza would be released soon and Israel would withdraw troops to an agreed upon line as the first step to a ""Strong, Durable, and Everlasting Peace"".Trump said, ""This means that ALL of the Hostages will be released very soon, and Israel will withdraw their Troops to an agreed upon line as the first steps toward a Strong, Durable, and Everlasting Peace. All Parties will be treated fairly! This is a GREAT Day for the Arab and Muslim World, Israel, all surrounding Nations, and the United States of America, and we thank the mediators from Qatar, Egypt, and Turkey, who worked with us to make this Historic and Unprecedented Event happen. BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS!""According to Trump, the agreement includes the release of hostages and prisoners and will allow a large flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza.Last month, Trump unveiled a 20-point plan to end the war and free the remaining hostages.Under the first phase of the deal, Hamas will release all hostages while Israel will withdraw its forces to an agreed line. The understanding followed talks in Egypt on Trump’s 20-point peace plan.Qatar described the development as ""the first phase of the Gaza ceasefire agreement, which will lead to ending the war, the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, and the entry of aid.""A source within Hamas was quoted as saying by the news agency AFP that the group will release 20 living hostages in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners as part of the first phase. Hamas has submitted a list of prisoners it wants freed by Israel at this stage of the truce.In return, Hamas is expected to release the remaining 47 hostages, both alive and dead, who were taken during its October 7, 2023 attack on Israel that triggered the war.The exchange is expected to take place within 72 hours after the agreement is implemented, which is set to be signed on Thursday, the source said.On Tuesday, Israelis and Palestinians marked two years since the Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, which ignited the war in Gaza.About 1,200 people, most of them civilians, were killed in the October 2023 attack, and 251 others were abducted, according to Israeli authorities. More than 65,000 Palestinians have since been killed in the war in Gaza, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.Many of the people kidnapped on Oct. 7 have been freed in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails during two ceasefires, one in the early months of the war and a second earlier this year. During some exchanges, gaunt Israeli hostages were paraded by Hamas before large crowds in Gaza, and sometimes made to thank their captors, scenes that further angered many Israelis.At least eight other hostages were freed in Israeli military operations.",US President Donald Trump announced on his Truth Social platform that Israel and Hamas have signed off on the first phase of a Gaza ceasefire. Israeli Ambassador to the US Yechiel Leiter told CNN that living hostages held by Hamas would be released on Sunday or Monday. Israeli Cabinet meets Thursday afternoon or evening to approve the agreement.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124403948,imgsize-933596,width-400,resizemode-4/lkj-40.jpg"

'Strange cure attempt': 82-year-old Chinese woman swallows 8 live frogs for back pain; here is what happened next,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/strange-cure-attempt-82-year-old-chinese-woman-swallows-8-live-frogs-for-back-pain-here-is-what-happened-next/articleshow/124402885.cms,"Representative Image (AI-generated)





An 82-year-old woman in eastern China has drawn widespread attention after swallowing eight small live frogs in an attempt to cure her lower back pain, following a local folk remedy.The woman, identified only by her surname Zhang, was admitted to a hospital in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, in early September after suffering from severe abdominal pain, South China Morning Post reported citing Hangzhou Daily.“My mother ate eight live frogs. Now the sharp pain has made her unable to walk,” her son told doctors.Zhang had long been suffering from a herniated disc and believed that consuming live frogs could ease her pain. Without explaining her plan, she asked her family to catch some frogs for her.Once they did, Zhang swallowed three frogs on the first day and five the next, all smaller than the size of an adult’s palm.She initially experienced mild discomfort, but the pain worsened over the next few days. Only then did she confess to her family what she had done.Doctors at Zhejiang University No 1 Affiliated Hospital examined Zhang and ruled out the presence of a tumour.However, they discovered a high number of oxyphil cells, an indicator of potential parasitic infections or blood disorders. Further tests confirmed that Zhang had indeed contracted parasites.“Swallowing frogs has damaged the patient’s digestive system and resulted in some parasites being present in her body, including sparganum,” a hospital doctor said.Zhang was discharged after two weeks of treatment.Dr Wu Zhongwen, a senior physician at the same hospital, said similar cases are not uncommon.“We have received several similar patients in recent years. Besides swallowing frogs, some individuals consume raw snake gall or fish gall, or apply frog skin to their own skin,” he said.He explained that most of these patients are elderly and often avoid discussing their health problems with their families. They typically seek medical help only when their condition becomes serious.“For instance, putting frog skin on one’s body is rumoured to treat skin diseases. However, there is no evidence to support this remedy. On the contrary, it could allow parasites to enter the body, resulting in vision impairment, intracranial infection, and even life-threatening conditions,” Wu added.In one recent case from the same province, a six-month-old baby girl developed lead poisoning after her mother used an online “remedy” for eczema by soaking her hand in a lead acetate solution.The lead residue then transferred to the baby’s skin, doctors said.","An 82-year-old woman in eastern China has drawn widespread attention after swallowing eight small live frogs in an attempt to cure her lower back pain.

Leavitt Clashes With Reporter As She Bashes Trump’s Portland Action | Watch





The Federal Aviation Administration warned that Hollywood Burbank Airport in California will be without air traffic controllers for several hours on Monday evening, as the government shutdown leaves many airport staff working without pay.The staffing shortage was scheduled to begin at 4.15 pm and continue until approximately 10.00 pm (local time).Air traffic controllers confirmed that their responsibilities will be temporarily transferred to Southern California TRACON, an approach and departure team based in San Diego, which will communicate with pilots landing and taking off from the airport, as reported by ABC News.Officials expect minimal disruption for travelers, though the full impact remains uncertain.An FAA advisory notes that several staffing triggers have been activated, resulting in ground delays at airports in Denver, Detroit, Indianapolis, and Phoenix.Air travel delays were widely anticipated as the government shutdown extended into its sixth day on Monday following a failed Senate vote. During the shutdown, numerous airport employees, including air traffic controllers, are required to work without pay.Control towers and airport security checkpoints continue to operate, with roughly 13,200 air traffic controllers and over 61,000 TSA employees expected to remain on duty.California Governor Gavin Newsom attributed the staffing shortage at Burbank Airport to US President Donald Trump.“Thanks, @realDonaldTrump! Burbank Airport has ZERO air traffic controllers from 4.15 pm to 10.00 pm today because of YOUR government shutdown,” Newsom said through a post on X.During the 35-day government shutdown in 2019, absences among air traffic controllers and TSA officers increased as employees missed paychecks, leading to longer checkpoint wait times at some airports. Air traffic in New York was slowed as a result, putting additional pressure on lawmakers to resolve the standoff quickly.The current shutdown comes amid existing staffing shortages at both the TSA and the Federal Aviation Administration, including a deficit of roughly 3,000 air traffic controllers. If the system cannot manage the scheduled flights, the FAA may slow landings and takeoffs, leading to increased delays and cancellations for passengers, as cited by ABC News.Meanwhile, as the US government shutdown entered its sixth day on Monday, the Senate once again rejected funding proposals from both parties. The Democratic plan failed 45–55, and the Republican measure was defeated 52–42, with both falling short of the 60 votes needed for approval.","Hollywood Burbank Airport in California will be without air traffic controllers for several hours on Monday evening.

Derrick Groves, the last of 10 inmates who escaped from a New Orleans jail nearly five months ago, was captured at a residence in Atlanta on Wednesday, the US marshals service confirmed.Groves, convicted of murdering two men during Mardi Gras 2018, had been on the run since May 16 after breaking out of the Orleans justice center with nine other prisoners.Deputy US Marshal Brian Fair said Groves was located after a tip to Crimestoppers Greater New Orleans and further investigation. The arrest followed a standoff with Atlanta Police and US marshals.“It took almost three hours to locate him in the house, gas had to be deployed into the house multiple times by (the) Atlanta Police Department’s SWAT team, and he was ultimately located hiding in a crawl space,” Fair told CNN.New Orleans district attorney Jason Williams called the escape “a serious breach of public safety and a historic failure of custodial security.” He added, “his capture brings long-awaited calm to victims, their families, the witnesses who testified, the assistant district attorneys who prosecuted him and the people of New Orleans.”Groves was convicted on two counts of second-degree murder and two counts of attempted second-degree murder, crimes that carry a life sentence.The jailbreak occurred shortly after midnight on May 16, when inmates used electric hair trimmers to cut through the walls of a cell behind a toilet, which they then concealed by replacing the toilet. Before fleeing, the prisoners left a message on a wall: “To Easy LoL.”The operation to capture Groves involved collaboration among multiple agencies including the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office, New Orleans Police, Louisiana state police, Homeland security investigations, and the FBI.Louisiana attorney general Liz Murrill said Groves will face charges related to the escape and vowed to prosecute “to the full extent of the law.”",Derrick Groves was convicted of murdering two men during Mardi Gras 2018.

Ex-FBI Chief James Comey Lambasts US President’s ‘Secret’ After Being Indicted | Watch





Former FBI Director James Comey pleaded not guilty on Wednesday during his federal court arraignment on charges brought following a public campaign by US President Donald Trump to prosecute him.Comey, who was indicted last month by a federal grand jury in the Eastern District of Virginia, faces two charges: making false statements and obstruction of a congressional proceeding. The indictment followed Trump’s social media call urging attorney general Pam Bondi to charge Comey, stating, ""We can't delay any longer.""During the brief hearing, Comey’s attorney, Pat Fitzgerald, waived the reading of the indictment and requested a jury trial. Comey himself spoke only once, affirming his understanding of his rights, saying, “I do your honor, thank you very much.” A trial date was set for January 5, with an expected duration of two to three days.Comey’s legal team plans to file motions challenging the charges as a vindictive and selective prosecution, and question the appointment of Lindsey Halligan, Trump’s former personal lawyer, as the US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia.Fitzgerald described Halligan’s appointment as “unlawful” and indicated they would also raise issues of “grand jury abuse” and “outrageous government conduct.”The charges stem from allegations that Comey lied to Congress about authorizing a third party to anonymously leak information regarding an FBI investigation. Comey has consistently denied the allegations, telling the Senate in 2017 and again in 2020, “I stand by the testimony.”The prosecution’s case was unusual, with Halligan, who lacks prosecutorial experience, presenting it alone to the grand jury after Trump pressured the previous acting US attorney to resign. While Halligan sought three charges, the grand jury found probable cause for two.Comey is due to appear before US district judge Michael Nachmanoff, with additional prosecutors Nathaniel Lemons and Gabriel J Diaz from a North Carolina US attorney’s office assisting in the case.Comey’s daughter, a former federal prosecutor herself, was present in court to support her father.This case is part of a broader pattern since Trump’s return to office, where he has called for charges against several political opponents, including New York attorney general Letitia James and Senator Adam Schiff.A group of former federal judges recently warned that the prosecution poses a “grave danger” to Americans’ rights, accusing Trump of “corruptly abusing the power of his office by directing the United States department of justice and the federal bureau of investigation to target his critics and his perceived political enemies.”","Former FBI Director James Comey pleaded not guilty on Wednesday during his federal court arraignment on charges brought following a public campaign by US President Donald Trump to prosecute him.

Hamas-style Ambush Stuns Pak: 12 Soldiers FALL Into Pakistani Taliban Trap, Drones Captured | Watch





A deadly ambush by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters near the Afghan border in the early hours of Wednesday claimed the lives of at least 11 Pakistani soldiers, including two senior officers - Maj Tayyab Rahat and Lt Col Junaid Arif.The attack was reported from the Kurram district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province. TTP fighters launched heavy gunfire at a military post, catching Pak military personnel by surprise. The TTP also suffered casualties in the fierce gunbattle, which lasted for a few hours, though the exact number remains unclear, sources said.The latest attack comes amid rising tensions, with the TTP retaliating against the Pakistani military's support for terror groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), which have gained ground in KPK of late. The ideological divide between the groups - the TTP adheres to Deobandi ideology and is anti-Pakistan, whereas groups like LeT follow the Ahle Hadith ideology and are pro-Pakistan -- is only fuelling the violence.Despite Pakistan's long-standing support for the Taliban, a militant group trained in Deobandi madrasas and instrumental in the fight against Russian and American forces, as well as local ethnic groups like the Tajiks, the TTP has defied Islamabad's expectations by asserting its autonomy.This independence poses a potential challenge for Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency, particularly in its plans to establish a new base for LeT in KPK, a region considered a Taliban stronghold.The TTP has turned vocal against Pak government's directly facilitating the relocation of terror groups from POK to Khyber regions. The situation turned tense when Pakistani military launched a ""clean-up drive"" in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to neutralise TTP cadres in Lower Dir district, a move aimed at smoothening LeT operations. The drive, launched in June, has not only resulted in the death of over two dozen TTP operatives but also allowed the LeT to start constructing its new terror centre within a month of the operation.","The attack was reported from the Kurram district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province.

Nineteen terrorists of the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and 11 soldiers were killed during an intelligence-based operation in the Orakzai district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, bordering Afghanistan, the military said. The operation was conducted on the intervening night of October 7-8 following reports of the presence of militants belonging to ""Fitna al-Khawarij,"" a term used for the TTP, the military's media wing said in a statement.During intense clashes between security forces and the militants, 19 terrorists ""were sent to hell,"" the statement said reported PTI, adding that 11 Pakistani soldiers, including a Lieutenant Colonel and a Major, were also killed. A sanitisation operation is ongoing to eliminate any remaining militants in the area.Pakistan has seen a surge in militant attacks, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, after the TTP called off its ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowed to target security forces, police, and law enforcement agencies.According to the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was the worst-hit region in the third quarter of 2025, suffering nearly 71 per cent (638) of total violence-related fatalities and over 67 per cent (221) of violent incidents.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, both sharing porous borders with Afghanistan, accounted for more than 96 per cent of terrorist-related violence in the country.According to the Reuters sources, the attack targeted a convoy of paramilitary troops operating in a volatile region that has seen repeated militant assaults in recent years. Security forces have launched a search operation to track down the attackers, while the government has yet to issue an official statement.Roadside bombs hit the convoy before a large group of militants opened fire in the northwestern district of Kurram, five Pakistani security officials told Reuters.The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement to a Reuters reporter. The army’s public relations wing did not immediately respond to requests for comment.In recent months, the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which seeks to overthrow the government and impose its hardline interpretation of Islamic governance, has intensified attacks on security forces.

India Won't Hold Back in Operation Sindoor 2.0: Army Chief Dwivedi Sends Clear Message To Pakistan





ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Army on Saturday criticised the recent remarks made by the Indian military officers and political leaders, warning that a future conflict between the two countries might lead to a ""cataclysmic devastation"".In a statement, it also said that these ""irresponsible statements"" indicate a renewed attempt at ""fabricating arbitrary pretexts for aggression"" - a prospect which might ""lead to serious consequences"" for peace and stability in South Asia.A day earlier, defence minister Rajnath Singh had said India can cross any border whenever necessary to protect citizens and safeguard India's unity and integrity. Indian Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi on Friday issued a stern warning to Pakistan , saying the neighbouring country should stop sponsoring terrorism on its soil if it wants to retain its place on the world map.General Dwivedi also said the restraint shown by New Delhi during Operation Sindoor would not be repeated in case of a future military conflict and urged Indian soldiers to remain poised for action.Also, chief of air staff Air Chief Marshal A P Singh on Friday said that at least a dozen Pakistani military aircraft, including US-origin F-16 jets, were destroyed or damaged in Indian strikes during Operation Sindoor.In its statement, the Pakistan Army said that it noted with ""grave concern"" the ""delusional, provocative and jingoistic statements"" coming from the highest levels of the Indian security establishment.""In the face of highly provocative statements of the Indian Defence Minister and its Army and Air Chiefs, we caution that a future conflict might lead to cataclysmic devastation. In case a fresh round of hostilities is triggered, Pakistan shall not hold back. We shall resolutely respond, without any qualms or restraint,"" it said.The statement said that Pakistan has established a ""new normal of response"", which will be ""swift, decisive and destructive"".It added that the armed forces of Pakistan have the capability and resolve ""to take the fight to every nook and corner of the enemy's territory"".The statement also responded to the threat of ""erasing Pakistan from the map"", saying India ""must know that if a situation comes, the erasure will be mutual"".It also said that earlier this year, the Indian attack against Pakistan brought two nuclear powers to the brink of a major war. ""...India now seems to be aching for the next round of confrontation,"" it added.In response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure in territories controlled by Pakistan.The strikes triggered four days of intense clashes that ended with an understanding on stopping the military actions on May 10.On Thursday, defence minister Singh said any misadventure by Islamabad in the Sir Creek sector will invite a ""decisive response"" that could be strong enough to change both ""history and geography"".Sir Creek is a 96-km-long tidal estuary between Gujarat's Rann of Kutch and Pakistan and is considered a disputed region due to varying interpretations of maritime boundary lines by both sides.

He said the group had prepared a counter-draft to the US proposal, focusing on an immediate ceasefire, humanitarian aid, and an end to the ongoing bloodshed in Gaza.Dar also reaffirmed that Pakistan will never recognise Israel and continues to back the two-state solution based on pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al Sharif (Jerusalem) as the capital of a future Palestinian state. He stressed that Pakistan’s stance remains unchanged.Dar also confirmed that the plan envisions deploying an international peacekeeping force in Palestine, and said Pakistan’s leadership would soon decide on contributing troops.Under Donald Trump’s proposed plan, military operations in Gaza would be suspended, existing battle lines would remain in place, and a temporary “technocratic, non-political” Palestinian administration would be established. The plan also calls for creating a “Board of Peace,” chaired by Trump, with former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair reportedly serving as an adviser.On Friday, Trump said Hamas must accept the proposed Gaza peace plan by Sunday, warning that failure to do so would result in further attacks.This comes as Hamas accepted some elements of Trump's plan to end the nearly two-year war and return all the remaining hostages taken in the October 7, 2023, attack.Hamas said it was willing to release the hostages and hand over power to other Palestinians, but that other aspects of the plan require further consultations among Palestinians. Senior Hamas officials suggested there were still major disagreements that required further negotiations.","Prime minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday hailed US President's plan calling it a ""step towards ending bloodshed"" On Friday, Pakistan's foreign minister Ishaq Dar said that Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan was not endorsed by Pakistan.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124307060,imgsize-660599,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

At Least 24 Killed As Pakistan Air Force Bombs Tirah Village In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa





At least four students were injured when a bomb exploded inside a private school in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, northwestern Pakistan, authorities said on Saturday.According to the school administration, a fourth-grade student picked up a “toy bomb” on his way to school in Jamrud tehsil, Khyber district, near the Afghan border and brought it into his classroom on Friday.Local authorities explained that “toy bombs” are actually abandoned mortar shells found in the province, especially near the Afghan border, which children often mistake for toys. The bomb exploded when the student dropped it on the classroom floor.The injured students were immediately taken to a hospital in Peshawar for treatment and were later discharged, news agency PTI reported.Security forces have blocked off the area and launched a search operation to locate and defuse any remaining unexploded shells to prevent further accidents. Police have also initiated an investigation into the incident.Incidents involving abandoned mortar shells are common in the region. Last year, on December 27, four boys were killed and two critically injured when an old mortar shell exploded in Bajaur district.Such devices continue to pose serious risks to local communities, particularly children, in heavily mined tribal areas along the Afghanistan border.","At least four students were injured when a bomb exploded inside a private school in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, northwestern Pakistan.

PoJK protests at the core







Protests in Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK) continued for a sixth consecutive day on Friday, spilling into the country’s capital, triggering a shocking police raid on the Islamabad National Press Club (NPC) that left several journalists injured and equipment vandalised.The assault has sparked nationwide outrage, with journalist unions announcing a “Black Day” in protest against what they called an attack on press freedom, ANI reported.Islamabad police stormed the National Press Club on Thursday, where members of the Lawyers’ Community of PoK were holding a peaceful demonstration in solidarity with ongoing protests in the region.Visuals widely shared on social media showed baton-wielding policemen dragging journalists, smashing cameras, and assaulting media staff inside the club premises. In one video, a photojournalist could be seen with a torn shirt and a broken camera.The Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) strongly condemned the attack, calling it one of the “darkest days” in Pakistan’s history.PFUJ President Afzal Butt said black flags would be hoisted at press clubs across the country in solidarity. “This is not only the Islamabad press club's issue,” Butt said at a press conference.“Press clubs across Pakistan believe that if they ignore this worst incident, tomorrow it could be Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar or Quetta,” he added.Videos circulating on social media show Pakistani Rangers using tear gas shells and live ammunition to disperse crowds. Internet, mobile, and landline services have been shut down, cutting off residents from their families and worsening the crisis.Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the incident and ordered an inquiry into the raid. “Violence against the journalist community cannot be tolerated under any circumstances,” Naqvi said, promising disciplinary action against those responsible.However, journalist unions rejected what they termed “mere promises.” They warned that if the government continued to use police action to suppress dissent, the protests would intensify.The Islamabad incident comes amid massive protests in PoK, which have entered their sixth consecutive day.The protests, which began two years ago, were initially sparked by demands for political reforms, subsidised wheat flour, reduced electricity tariffs, free education and healthcare, and an end to privileges for government officials.The unrest intensified after at least three civilians were killed during police firing in Muzaffarabad, ANI reported.Their funeral processions drew thousands, fuelling more anger. Reports suggest that over 10 people have died in the clashes so far, with many critically injured.","Islamabad police stormed the National Press Club on Thursday.

"40 Killed, 80 injured in Myanmar: Paragliders drop bombs on Buddhist festival celebrations; children among dead",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/40-killed-80-injured-in-myanmar-paragliders-drop-bombs-on-buddhist-festival-celebrations-children-among-dead/articleshow/124378510.cms,"Thadingyut festival (PTI)

Poll Do you believe the international community is doing enough to protect civilians in Myanmar? Yes No





At least 40 people were killed and around 80 others were injured in a paramotor attack on a festival and protest in central Myanmar on Monday, a spokesperson for the exiled National Unity Government told the BBC.Hundreds had gathered in Chaung U township in central Myanmar on Monday evening for the Thadingyut full moon festival when the military dropped bombs on the crowd, according to a member of the organizing committee.The woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity for security reasons, said the gathering included both the festival and an anti-junta demonstration.""The committee alerted people and one-third of the crowd managed to flee,"" the woman was quoted as saying by AFP. ""But immediately, one motor-powered paraglider flew right over the crowd"", dropping two bombs on the centre of the gathering.""Children were completely torn apart,"" she added.She said that once another motorized paraglider flying overhead had left the area, people rushed in to assist the wounded.Locals said that the damage from Monday’s bombings made it difficult to identify the victims.""As of this morning, we were still collecting body parts from the ground -- pieces of flesh, limbs, parts of bodies that were blown apart,"" the woman added.The junta has increasingly turned to paramotors due to a shortage of aircraft and helicopters, a situation compounded by international sanctions that have made it harder for the regime to acquire military equipment, as cited by the BBC.In a statement on Tuesday, Amnesty International described the junta's use of motorized paragliders to target communities as part of a “disturbing trend” in the region.Joe Freeman, Amnesty International's Myanmar researcher, said the attack “should serve as a gruesome wake-up call that civilians in Myanmar need urgent protection.”Myanmar has been engulfed in civil conflict since the military seized power in a 2021 coup, prompting pro-democracy forces to take up arms and align with ethnic armed groups against the junta.At the candlelight vigil, participants protested military conscription and the upcoming elections while calling for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners.The country is scheduled to hold general elections in December, the first since the 2021 coup. Critics, however, argue that the vote will not be free or fair, and is likely to enable the junta to maintain unchecked control.","At least 40 people were killed and around 80 others were injured in a paramotor attack on a festival and protest in central Myanmar on Monday.

From fields to fame: Majestic water buffaloes crowned in Chonburi; crowds applaud Thailand’s unique beauty contest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/from-fields-to-fame-majestic-water-buffaloes-crowned-in-chonburi-crowds-applaud-thailands-unique-beauty-contest/articleshow/124364600.cms,"(Photo credit: AP)





Five-year-old Tod made his debut at the annual water buffalo racing and beauty festival held in Chonburi on Monday. Chonburi is a city in the province of Thailand, about an hour's drive from Bangkok.Tod, the prized stud of food vendor and farmer Thawatchai Daeng-Ngam, was one of the stars of the event, stealing the show. His bright red ears stood out against his sleek black fur.Once considered humble draft animals vital to Thai agriculture, water buffaloes have now become prized show animals. The festival, held at the end of the 11th lunar month to mark the start of the harvest season, celebrates these animals that once ploughed fields and transported heavy loads. Today, many buffaloes are raised for competitions or sold for meat.The Chonburi festival featured a parade of buffaloes adorned with flower crowns, pulling traditional wooden carriages with wheels over 2 metres tall, and carrying owners and women dressed in traditional Thai attire. The event also included a 100-metre sprint race, with jockeys riding the buffaloes at full speed.Pitun Rassamee competed with his three-year-old albino buffalo, Lookaew, which had already won several local pageants. “Although buffaloes can still work in the field, they cannot compete with machines,” said Thawatchai, whose family owns 30 buffaloes, including Tod. “Buffaloes are still important to me. It’s like what they said: ‘People raise buffaloes, and buffaloes raise people.’ They’re like family members,” he added, according to news agency AP The shift from farm labourers to show animals has come with the mechanization of farming and a decline in buffalo populations. Competitions have sparked renewed interest and a growing industry, supported by the government. Since 2017, Thailand has observed Thai Buffalo Conservation Day, and local authorities provide breeding assistance to farmers.Raising a show buffalo can be intensive. On larger farms, animals are bathed daily and fed a special diet of corn, soybeans, bran, and vitamins. At the festival, caretakers splashed water over the larger, prize-winning animals, which are judged on horn size, hoof smoothness, and overall physique.“Each year, it has become bigger and bigger,” said Papada Srisophon, assistant to a village chief near a livestock centre. “Without this activity, they won’t know what to do with their buffaloes, and they won’t be motivated to keep their buffaloes,” she told AP.For many owners, the competitions are more than just sport or show, they reflect a lifelong bond with the animals.","Chonburi is a city in the province of Thailand, about an hour's drive from Bangkok.
