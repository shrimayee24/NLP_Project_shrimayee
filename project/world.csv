US President-elect Donald Trump 's legal team filed a motion Monday to dismiss his hush money conviction, arguing it interferes with presidential duties. The filing, made public Tuesday, claims continuing the case would disrupt the presidential transition and disregard voters' ""overwhelming national mandate.""Prosecutors have until December 9 to reply and said they are open to delaying sentencing until Trump’s second term ends in 2029. Trump’s lawyers called this a ""ridiculous suggestion.""In May, Trump was found guilty of falsifying 34 counts of business records linked to a $130,000 payment made by his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, to adult film star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. Daniels claims she had a sexual encounter with Trump, which he denies. This marked the first time a US president was convicted of a criminal offence.Trump had pleaded not guilty, calling the case a politically motivated attack by Democrat prosecutor Alvin Bragg to derail his campaign. His lawyers argued that continuing the case could disrupt the government. The offence carries up to four years in prison. However, jail time is considered unlikely for a first-time offender on these charges. As this is a state case, Trump cannot pardon himself.Trump's lawyers argueManhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg ’s prosecution is politically motivated, comparing it to President Biden’s criticism of his son Hunter Biden 's prosecution. They wrote, “President Biden asserted that his son was ‘selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted,’ and ‘treated differently.’”Trump's team also contends dismissing the case would allow Trump to focus on addressing New York City's ""deteriorating conditions"" and ""protect its residents from violent crime."" They added it would allow him ""to devote all of his energy to protecting the Nation.”Judge Juan M. Merchan postponed Trump's sentencing after the election. He will now consider the dismissal motion along with a previous request from Trump to dismiss the case based on immunity. Merchan’s decision could range from upholding the verdict and proceeding to sentencing, delaying the case, or waiting for a federal appeals court ruling on a separate effort by Trump to move the case.Prosecutors argued the hush money payment was part of an effort to hide negative stories from voters. Trump’s then-lawyer Michael Cohen made the payment, which Trump later reimbursed and categorized as legal expenses. Trump maintains the payments were legitimate legal expenses.Trump’s lawyers are also using a recent Supreme Court decision about prosecuting ex-presidents for their official actions to support his case. They claim the jury was shown improper evidence, like his financial disclosures and social media posts.

Adams stands firm despite backlash

Trump administration prepares for ""largest deportation operation""

New York City Mayor Eric Adams has expressed his willingness to deport migrants charged with crimes , signalling a departure from his earlier stance of waiting for convictions.Adams also announced plans to collaborate with President-elect Donald Trump’s administration, including a meeting with incoming ""border czar"" Tom Homan, to discuss strategies for addressing criminal activities involving migrants.""My position is simple: people who commit crimes in our city have abdicated their right to remain here,"" Adams said during a Tuesday press briefing, according to the New York Post.He referred specifically to cases like that of Bernardo Castro Mata, a 19-year-old Venezuelan migrant accused of shooting two NYPD officers, saying, ""I don’t want that guy in my city, plain and simple.""The mayor emphasised the need to act against individuals who pose a threat to public safety, stating, ""Those committing crimes—robberies, shootings, or rapes—have been a harm to our country. Cancel me if you want, but I’m going to protect the people of this city.""He criticised what he described as the reluctance of progressive leaders to address such issues, asserting that his stance aligns with earlier positions held by prominent Democrats like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, who supported the deportation of criminals during their time.Adams also defended his selective approach, clarifying that law-abiding undocumented immigrants, including ""Dreamers"" like his commissioner of immigrant affairs Manuel Castro, should not face deportation. ""These are people who love our country and contribute positively,"" he said, as per Daily Caller.Tom Homan, the incoming border czar and former ICE director, has pledged to implement what he described as the ""largest deportation operation in US history.""Homan emphasised that the focus will initially be on individuals who pose a risk to public safety.In a recent interview, he warned that resistance from Democratic governors and mayors could lead to legal consequences, even jail time. ""We’re going to do the job with or without their cooperation,"" Homan told Fox News last month.New York City, a sanctuary city, faces particular challenges.According to ICE data cited by The New York Post, over 58,000 migrants in the city are either convicted felons or facing pending criminal charges. This influx, combined with rising crime rates, has strained city resources.Adams has previously criticised the Biden administration for its lack of support, stating last year that the migrant crisis ""will destroy"" New York City.Adams' willingness to cooperate with the Trump administration reflects a broader shift in immigration policy discourse, following a presidential election that highlighted border security concerns. ""The American people voted for change on immigration,"" Adams remarked, urging a collaborative approach with federal authorities.Despite his calls for deporting criminals, Adams reaffirmed his commitment to supporting law-abiding migrants.","New York City Mayor Eric Adams has expressed his willingness to deport migrants charged with crimes.

Debbie Nelson, mother of rapper Eminem, has passed away at the age of 69 from complications related to lung cancer .According to TMZ, a representative for Eminem confirmed the news that she died on December 2 in St. Joseph, Missouri. Nelson’s illness was initially revealed in September when reports suggested her condition was critical.Born in 1955 on a military base in Kansas, Nelson endured a tumultuous upbringing in a ""large dysfunctional family,"" as detailed in her 2008 memoir ‘My Son Marshall, My Son Eminem’.Following her parents’ separation before she turned 10, she became the primary caregiver for her four younger siblings. At 16, she married Marshall Bruce Mathers Jr, Eminem’s father, and welcomed her son two years later in 1972.Eminem, whose real name is Marshall Mathers, shared a complicated relationship with his mother, often referenced in his music.In tracks like ""Cleanin’ Out My Closet,"" he accused her of neglect and drug use, allegations she denied. Nelson responded by filing a $10 million defamation lawsuit against him in 1999.Although she won, the judgement awarded her just $25,000, with only $1,600 remaining after legal fees, according to ABC News.Despite their rocky past, the two appeared to mend their relationship over time.In 2013, Eminem released the song ‘Headlights’, in which he apologised for his earlier criticisms and expressed regret for airing their grievances publicly. He acknowledged her struggles, singing, “I don’t hate you ‘cause, Ma / You’re still beautiful to me.”Nelson showed public support for her son in later years, notably congratulating him on his 2022 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame . In a now-deleted video, she expressed her pride, saying, ""I knew you’d get there. It’s been a long ride. I’m very, very proud of you.""Eminem’s father, Marshall Mathers Sr, passed away in 2019 at the age of 67.

Televised address shocks the nation

'Protecting constitutional order'

Budget dispute sparks tensions

Opposition blamed for public safety chaos

Implementation of martial law unclear

Opposition condemns martial law

Division among ruling party members

Heightened tensions

Political polarization

South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol declared ""emergency martial law"" on Tuesday, accusing opposition parties of crippling governance, sympathizing with North Korea, and undermining the nation’s constitutional order.The unexpected announcement, made during a televised address, caused widespread shock. While South Korea has experienced authoritarian rule in the past, it has been considered democratic since the 1980s.""To safeguard a liberal South Korea from the threats posed by North Korea's communist forces and to eliminate anti-state elements... I hereby declare emergency martial law,"" Yoon stated. He defended the decision as necessary to protect the nation's constitutional order and freedoms.The declaration comes amid heightened disputes between Yoon's People Power Party and the opposition Democratic Party over next year’s budget. Opposition lawmakers, who hold a majority in the 300-member parliament, recently approved a downsized budget proposal, which Yoon criticized for slashing key funds.""Our National Assembly has become a haven for criminals, a den of legislative dictatorship that seeks to paralyze the judicial and administrative systems and overturn our liberal democratic order,"" Yoon said.Yoon accused the opposition of slashing budgets crucial for combating drug crimes and ensuring public safety. He warned that such actions had turned South Korea into ""a drug haven and a state of public safety chaos.""Specific measures under martial law remain undisclosed, leaving questions about its implementation. Yoon emphasized the need to ""restore the country to normalcy by getting rid of anti-state forces.""The opposition has fiercely criticized the move. Leader Lee Jae-myung warned of dire consequences in an online livestream, saying, ""Tanks, armored personnel carriers, and soldiers with guns and knives will rule the country. The economy of the Republic of Korea will collapse irretrievably."" He urged citizens to gather at the National Assembly.Korean news agency Yonhap reported that ruling party chief Han Dong-hoon opposed the declaration, calling it ""wrong"" and pledging to block it with public support. Han’s statement reflects divisions within Yoon’s own party.The strained relationship between Yoon and the opposition reached a breaking point earlier this year when Yoon became the first president since 1987 to skip the opening ceremony of a new parliamentary term. His office cited ongoing parliamentary probes and impeachment threats as the reason for his absence.Opposition lawmakers claim that Yoon had undermined democratic processes by using his veto power against parliamentary bills and appointing loyalists to key military positions, fueling speculation about his intentions.The martial law declaration has further polarized South Korea’s political landscape. Experts warn that the deepening divide could erode public trust in democratic institutions.“This confrontation has turned into a political war,” said had Choi Jin, head of the Institute for Presidential Leadership. “It’s an all-or-nothing battle that benefits no one.”Jhee Byong-kuen, a political science professor at Chosun University, had also criticized Yoon’s uncompromising leadership style, saying it exacerbates polarization and public disillusionment.","South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol declared ""emergency martial law"" on Tuesday.

The Tragic Loss of Her Father



Why Is America Searching for Hannah?



What Are Authorities Saying?



Public Response and Efforts



What’s Next?



The disappearance of 30-year-old Hannah Kobayashi has captured the attention of the nation, not only for its mysterious circumstances but also for the heartbreak surrounding her family. A promising young photographer from Hawaii, Hannah vanished after missing a connecting flight in Los Angeles in early November. What followed was a series of strange developments that deepened the intrigue and concern surrounding her case.From bizarre text messages to confirmed sightings near the U.S.-Mexico border, the search for Hannah has become a national story. Tragically, the efforts to find her have been overshadowed by the death of her father, who travelled to Los Angeles to help in the search. As the investigation continues, America is left asking: who is Hannah Kobayashi, and what led to her disappearance?Hannah Kobayashi, a Maui native, was in the early stages of her career as a photographer. After years of pursuing unpaid projects and honing her craft, she finally secured a paid photography assignment in New York City—a milestone she had been working toward for years. Excited about her trip, Hannah reportedly created a detailed itinerary of places she planned to visit, including restaurants and museums, and booked a hotel room costing thousands of dollars.Her family described her as ambitious, creative, and organised. This made her sudden disappearance all the more alarming. According to relatives, she showed no prior signs of wanting to leave her life behind, although she had expressed a desire to disconnect from modern technology. This detail has become a key consideration in understanding her actions leading up to her disappearance.Hannah landed at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) on 8 November, planning to catch a connecting flight to New York. When she missed her connection, she requested that her luggage be retrieved in Los Angeles rather than forwarded to New York. This was the first unusual step in a series of puzzling events.Between 8 and 11 November, surveillance footage captured Hannah at multiple locations across Los Angeles. On 11 November, she was last seen retrieving her luggage from LAX. Shortly afterward, her communications with family members became erratic. She sent bizarre and uncharacteristic text messages, which worried her loved ones. Then, her phone went dead.The search for Hannah took a significant turn when authorities announced they had obtained footage of her crossing the U.S.-Mexico border on foot in mid-November. Carrying her luggage, she was seen alone and appeared to have purchased a bus ticket to a border town. This led investigators to believe that her crossing was intentional and voluntary. Authorities also found no evidence of foul play or trafficking, adding to the mystery of why she left the United States.Hannah’s disappearance devastated her family, particularly her father, who flew to Los Angeles to assist in the search. For 13 days, he combed the city for any trace of his daughter. However, the strain proved too much. In late November, he was found dead, with authorities ruling his death a suicide.The Kobayashi family released a heartfelt statement expressing their immeasurable grief and urging the public to remain focused on finding Hannah. Her father’s death underscored the emotional toll the search has taken on those who knew and loved her.Hannah Kobayashi’s case has struck a chord with people across the United States for several reasons. Firstly, her disappearance raises questions about how someone can seemingly vanish in an age of constant connectivity and surveillance. Despite living in a world where most movements are trackable, Hannah’s case highlights how personal choices—such as disconnecting from technology—can create gaps in communication that complicate searches.Secondly, her story touches on the universal fear of losing a loved one without explanation. The fact that she appeared to leave voluntarily, yet in a way that concerned her family, creates a complex narrative. It forces the public to consider the balance between personal autonomy and familial responsibility, as well as the pressures young adults face in pursuing their dreams while maintaining ties to home.Lastly, the tragic death of her father has humanised the case in a deeply painful way. It serves as a reminder of how missing person cases affect not just the individuals involved but also their families and communities. The Kobayashi family’s suffering has evoked widespread sympathy and underscored the urgency of finding Hannah to bring closure to a grieving family.The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) has classified Hannah as a “voluntary” missing person. This means that, based on the evidence, they believe she chose to leave of her own accord. However, they are urging her to contact authorities or a U.S. embassy in Mexico to confirm her safety. While there is no indication of foul play, law enforcement emphasises the importance of ensuring her well-being.Nonprofit organisations have joined the Kobayashi family in their search for Hannah, distributing flyers and spreading awareness online. Social media campaigns have also played a crucial role, as people across the country share her story and photos in the hope of generating leads.The family has urged anyone who sees Hannah to contact emergency services immediately. They have also requested that members of the public try to take a photograph of her if possible and safely keep her in sight until law enforcement arrives.The search for Hannah Kobayashi continues, with authorities focusing on verifying her location and ensuring her safety. As her family waits for news, the public remains captivated by her story—a mix of mystery, tragedy, and the hope that she can be found safe.","Hannah Kobayashi, 30, vanished after missing a connecting flight in Los Angeles in early November.

Charles Kupperman, deputy national security adviser during first Trump era, warned that Patel's ideas would be anathema to FBI's mission. ""These are not reforms, they are punitive measures,"" he said.Trump has repeatedly vowed to use the justice department to ""go after"" his political adversaries in a second term. Although Patel would need a factual basis for suspecting someone of wrongdoing to open an investigation, department rules give significant discretion to FBI officials. If Patel wanted to open investigations on a flimsy basis, he would need to find subordinates willing to go along. For those targeted, such probes are highly disruptive, including paying expensive attorneys, even if they never result in charges.Patel has threatened to unleash law enforcement powers on the mainstream media, which Trump likes to call ""the enemies of the people"". Patel has also called for using the justice department more aggressively to uncover who in the govt is providing information to reporters, and said that leakers should be prosecuted. He wrote in his book that all federal staff should be forced to submit to monthly scans of their devices ""to determine who has improperly transferred classified information.""Patel rose in political circles by trying to discredit the FBI's probe into the 2016 Trump campaign's ties to Russia, and he holds deep contempt for justice department prosecutors, FBI agents and investigators, all of whom he accuses of political corruption. In a Sept 2024 podcast, he declared that he would close the FBI's Washington HQ. ""I'd shut down the FBI Hoover Building on Day 1 and reopen it the next day as a museum of the 'deep state,'"" Patel said. ""And I'd take the 7,000 employees that work in that building and send them across America to chase down criminals. Go be cops.""

Reid Hoffman: Conspiracy theory behind Reid Hoffman considering leaving US is...; Elon Musk agrees,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/conspiracy-theory-behind-reid-hoffman-considering-leaving-us-is-elon-musk-agrees/articleshow/115948018.cms,"Reid Hoffman is considering leaving the US after Donald Trump's win, an NYT report claimed.

One of the conspiracy theories behind LinkedIn co-founder Reif Hoffman's consideration about leaving the US after Donald Trump 's win is that he is ""terrified"" that Epstein's client list would be published and his name would be on that as he visited Epstein Island. Elon Musk lent his support to the theory and said it is 100 per cent the reason.New York Times reported that Hoffman supported Kamala Harris and according to reports he told his friends that he was thinking of relocating to somewhere else because he thinks Trump would use his power to seek retribution against his political enemies. Hoffman donated $10 million to a super PAC backing Kamala Harris and also helped bankroll a defamation lawsuit filed against Trump by former New York magazine writer E Jean Carroll.Wall Street Journal reported in May that Hoffman visited Epstein's private Caribbean island on at least one occasion in 2014. But the intent for the trip was never known. Hoffman did not deny his association with Epstein and said it ""gnaws at"" him that his association with Epstein ""helped his (Epstein's) reputation, and thus delayed justice for his survivors"". ""My last interaction with Epstein was in 2015. Still, by agreeing to participate in any fundraising activity where Epstein was present, I helped to repair his reputation and perpetuate injustice,"" Hoffman said in 2019. ""For this, I am deeply regretful.""Conservative commentator Charlie Kirk asked on X why Reid Hoffman would flee the country if he did nothing wrong. ""LinkedIn co-founder and Democrat mega-donor Reid Hoffman is reportedly considering fleeing the United States. Hoffman, 57, has funneled hundreds of millions of dollars into the Democrat party in recent years and funded some of the most aggressive lawfare attacks on Trump, including the E. Jean Carroll sexual assault case. Hoffman also financially backed Nikki Haley's primary campaign and invested millions of dollars into voting company Smartmatic to help finance its defamation lawsuits against Fox News and Newsmax following the 2020 election,"" Kirk wrote.Ahead of the election, Trump once said he would be inclined to release full Epstein files.","LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman is considering leaving the US after Donald Trump's win, an NYT report claimed.

Relentless bullying

Attempted suicide and hospitalisation

Seeking Justice

Community Support

A heartbreaking case in South Carolina has drawn national attention after a 12-year-old girl attempted suicide following relentless bullying, leaving her with severe brain damage.The girl, identified as Kelaia Turner , was reportedly tormented for over a year at Dr Phinnize J. Fisher Middle School in Greenville. Her family has now filed a lawsuit against the school district and nine staff members, alleging negligence in handling the bullying.As per The New York Post, Kelaia’s struggles began in 2021 when she decided to embrace her natural hair, which made her the target of cruel taunts.According to the lawsuit, students called her derogatory names such as “roach” and mocked her appearance. Shockingly, her teacher, Olivia Bennett, allegedly joined in, laughing when students referred to Kelaia as “roach.”The situation worsened over time. In one instance in May 2022, students played a racially offensive YouTube video called ‘The Black People Song’ in class, with teacher John Teer allegedly failing to intervene.Later that year, her bullies poured water on her clothes and discarded them in the trash. The harassment escalated even further, with no meaningful intervention by school officials, according to the lawsuit filed in November.On March 17, 2023, unable to cope with the torment, Kelaia hanged herself in her bedroom using a belt. Her mother, Ty Turner, discovered her daughter’s lifeless body.“She was cool to the touch, blood was coming out of her nose,” she said in an emotional statement. Paramedics were able to revive Kelaia after she had been without oxygen for eight minutes.Kelaia spent 31 days in the ICU and over 100 days in the hospital, suffering severe brain damage that has left her unable to control her body.During her hospitalisation, one of the alleged bullies managed to enter the ICU, took photos of the intubated girl, and posted them on social media to mock her, the lawsuit claims.Ty Turner says the school district failed to protect her daughter, despite numerous complaints over the year-and-a-half-long ordeal.“They used to teach us, ‘Sticks and stones will break my bones, but words will never harm me.’ Unfortunately, words do hurt,” WFY44 quoted her.The family is now seeking damages to cover Kelaia’s medical expenses, special education, and life care needs.The Greenville County Schools district has denied the allegations, stating, “We disagree with these allegations and have conducted a thorough investigation and review of each allegation at the time they were made. While we do not agree with the allegations, our hearts go out to Kelaia Tecora Turner, her mother, and their family.”A GoFundMe campaign started by Kelaia’s mother has raised over $15,000 as of Tuesday. The funds will help cover the cost of a wheelchair-accessible van, medical expenses, and home care.“We are fighting for Kelaia’s healing and well-being every day,” Ty wrote on the campaign page, urging others to show solidarity by wearing butterfly-themed items, a symbol of hope for her daughter.","Kelaia Turner, 12, was tormented for over a year at Dr Phinnize J.

Trump replied – asking, so your country can't survive unless it's ripping off the US to the tune of $100 billion? Trump then suggested to Trudeau that Canada become the 51st state, which caused the prime minister and others to laugh nervously, Fox News reported.It was meant to be a joke and Trudeau and other Canadian officials laughed nervously. But it sent across the strong stand that Trump is going to take as he assumes the office.Canada public safety minister Dominic LeBlanc, who was with Trudeau at Mar-a-Lago, said the government has prepared a list of additional measures that would be important to improve border security quickly.

PESHAWAR: The death toll from sectarian violence in Pakistan's restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province surged to 130, with at least six people killed and eight injured on Sunday, as clashes in the volatile Kurram district continued for the eleventh consecutive day.The clashes between Alizai and Bagan tribes in the district started on November 22, after an attack on a convoy of passenger vans near Parachinar in which 47 people were killed a day earlier. Several passengers who had sustained grave injuries succumbed later, raising the toll in the convoy killing to 57.Police said the situation remained tense, and violence persists despite a recent ceasefire agreement between the Sunni and Shia groups.The six new deaths reported on Sunday brought the death toll to 130, while the total number of injured rose to 186 after eight fresh injuries were reported.The 10-day truce brokered last week has been rendered ineffective by intermittent violence, which shows no signs of abating.A high-powered delegation, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Secretary Nadeem Aslam Chaudhry and IGP Akhtar Hayat Gandapur, had also negotiated a ceasefire last weekend, but violence resumed shortly afterwards.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi earlier planned to dispatch members of the grandpeace jirga (council of tribal leaders) from Kohat division to Kurram for engaging with leaders from both warring factions to negotiate peace.Addressing a gathering of political leaders and tribal elders in Kohat on Sunday, he called for strict action with public cooperation to make the region weapon-free through joint operations.He said he was ready to go to Kurram and stay there for as many days as the jirga suggested to ensure peace in the region.""No other country or province will resolve our issues.
