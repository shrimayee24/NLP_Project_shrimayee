FARIDABAD: There was no foreboding of the extraordinary day that would reduce the Mehtos from a family of six to one.Not even that morning. June 10 bore the stamp of routine. The boys took their usual morning baths before the heatwave made an oven of their room. Their mother made parathas for breakfast. Their father, Manoj Mehto, lazed, ambled around the alley, spoke to a few neighbours. Like he did on days he did not go to work, which would be twice or thrice a week.""It was a normal Tuesday morning,"" Preeti told TOI on Wednesday, alone in a house - in fact, a room- where four boys and two adults packed in, each with a few inches marked out to sleep or sit, bedroom, living room and kitchen rolled into one.The little room in Subhash Colony would allow no secrets, at least not within its confines. As people living in other such dwellings on the road put it, it's so cramped that even thoughts could get heard.And yet, the storm raging in 36-year-old Mehto's mind made no noise. Preeti has to think hard to remember if anything was amiss. Yes, it was odd of him to put on new clothes. But it had seemed in tune with what Preeti read as a jovial mood and a desire to take the boys out to a park.""You come too,"" he insisted to her, speaking of a 'family outing'.""But I wasn't feeling well and had a lot of work to do at home, so I refused. I told him to take the children out. They all left and never returned...,"" a distraught Preeti said as neighbours crowded the house with one question - why?Preeti did not have an answer.Manoj had not gone to the park. He bought chips and cola and headed for the railway tracks nearby. The five of them sat on the tracks under the Elson Chowk flyover. The boys had no inkling of what was to happen. For close to an hour, they sat there. One of the most horrifying deaths the country has seen unfolded next as a train - Golden Temple Express - ran them over. The boys, according to witnesses, struggled to be released but Mehto held on firm, making sure all five of them would be right in line when the train came. He had made his younger sons Chotu (3) and Murli (5) sit on his shoulders and held Pawan (10) and Kaaro (7) by their arms.Police have initiated an inquest and are still searching for a motive. After questioning different people, police officers said they had come to know that Manoj might have had some ""trust issues"" and was particularly peeved with a neighbour of Preeti's parents back at their home in Bihar's Lakhisarai who helped take her messages to them.""Preeti's parents did not have mobile phones, so she would call the neighbour, a man she refers to as a 'cousin', and request him to help her get in touch with them. There was nothing more to it,"" said Rajender Singh, in charge of the railway police post in Ballabgarh.The couple's neighbours in Subhash Colony said they hadn't heard any arguments between Manoj and Preeti. Preeti told police she didn't have any recent disagreement with Manoj. The two had fallen in love and got married 11 years ago.""We got married, and my sister married Manoj's brother. We shifted here (Faridabad) three years ago, and I stayed at home because he always asked me not to take a job and raise his kids well,"" Preeti said.Seema Devi, a neighbour who visited the couple's house on Wednesday, said she didn't know the family, but came to convey her condolences. ""We are all shattered by this very disturbing incident. I came to pay condolences and wanted to know what led the man to make such a decision,"" she said.A police officer said Mehto's and the boys' bodies are currently at the mortuary of BK Civil Hospital. ""Manoj's brother requested us to wait for the autopsy till he arrives in Faridabad. He will reach on Thursday, after which the post-mortem examination will be conducted,"" he said.","Manoj Mehto waited with his four sons till the train crushed them.

Houthi Revenge Hits Israel: Ballistic Missile Breaks Mid-Air, IDF Scrambles 7 Interceptors | Watch





A Houthi ballistic missile launched at Israeli civilians nearly struck a civilian plane on Tuesday evening.The missile was intercepted by Israeli air defenses, preventing a potential mass casualty event instigated by Iranian-backed terrorists, claimed the Israeli war room. ""A Houthi ballistic missile launched at Israeli civilians nearly hit a civilian plane. If not for the competence of Israeli air defenses, there could have been a mass casualty event caused by Iranian-backed terrorists,"" it said in a post on X, while sharing a video.In the video, the plane can be seen flying away just moments before the missiles were intercepted.The Israeli military stated that the missiles fired from Yemen, were intercepted after breaking into multiple fragments upon impact with an interceptor.Consequently, the Israeli Air Force deployed additional interceptors to neutralise the debris. At least seven interceptors were launched during the operation. In previous instances, partially intercepted Houthi missiles have resulted in casualties when intact warheads fell to the ground. The Houthis, an Iran-backed group, claimed responsibility for the attack, announcing the launch of two ballistic missiles targeting Ben Gurion Airport in central Israel.According to a military official quoted by The Times of Israel, the second missile either fell short or disintegrated in the air, consistent with several Houthi projectiles in recent weeks.The missile attack triggered sirens shortly before 8 pm across central Israel, the Jerusalem area, southern West Bank settlements, and selected regions in southern Israel. Two minutes prior to the sirens, an early warning was sent to residents through push notifications on their phones, alerting them to the long-range missile threat.The Israel Defence Forces issued a statement regarding the incoming attack approximately five minutes before the sirens activated. No injuries were reported from the attack. Debris from the intercepted missile and interceptors landed near Jerusalem and in the West Bank, causing no significant damage.Then on Tuesday morning, the Israeli Navy conducted its first-ever strike on Yemen by destroying infrastructure at the Hodeida port. The operation involved two guided missiles launched from advanced Sa’ar 6-class corvettes positioned hundreds of kilometres away. This action marked the 11th Israeli strike against the Houthis since the conflict began, with the previous ten strikes executed by the Air Force.The Houthis, whose slogan proclaims “Death to America, Death to Israel, [and] a Curse on the Jews,” initiated attacks on Israel and maritime traffic in November 2023, a month following the October 7 Hamas massacre. The group ceased its attacks when a ceasefire was established between Israel and Hamas in January 2025. By that time, the Houthis had launched over 40 ballistic missiles and numerous drones and cruise missiles at Israel, including one that caused civilian casualties in Tel Aviv in July, triggering Israel’s initial strike in Yemen.Since March 18, when the Israel Defence Forces resumed their offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip after a temporary ceasefire, the Houthis have launched 48 ballistic missiles and at least 11 drones at Israel, with several of the missiles failing to reach their targets.","Houthi ballistic missile launched at Israeli civilians nearly struck a civilian plane on Tuesday evening.

FBI director Kash Patel , an Indian-origin official leading the agency, announced Tuesday the extradition of Muhammad Shahzeb Khan, a Pakistani citizen residing in Canada to the United States on terrorism charges.Khan is accused of attempting to provide material support to ISIS and plotting a mass shooting at a Jewish center in Brooklyn, New York.“Major news… earlier this afternoon, Muhammad Shahzeb Khan, a Pakistani citizen residing in Canada, was extradited to the United States on charges of attempting to provide material support to ISIS and attempting to commit acts of terrorism,” Patel wrote on X.According to the FBI, Khan allegedly planned to travel from Canada to New York and carry out a mass shooting on October 7, 2024 — the anniversary of the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel — in support of ISIS. He was arrested by Canadian authorities on September 4, 2024, before the attack could be executed.“Thankfully, the great work of FBI teams and our partners exposed those plans and shut them down,” Patel said. “He has now arrived in the U.S. and will face American justice.”Calling it a reminder of the “constant threat of terrorism facing every corner of the world,” Patel also highlighted the “disturbing rise in threats against our Jewish communities.”He credited multiple FBI field offices, including in New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles, for their role in the operation.Though the announcement came from Indian-origin Patel, many in India have long remained skeptic on the United States for allegedly providing safe haven to Pakistan-backed terrorists. However, under the Trump administration, Washington’s stance appears to be shifting.Just after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the White House, President Donald Trump approved the extradition of Tahawwur Rana, a Pakistani-origin key accused in the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks, to India.Rana was handed over in April to face trial for his role in the attacks.Still, another central figure in the case, David Headley, remains imprisoned in the United States.President Trump also strongly condemned the terror attack in Pahalgam, which claimed the lives of at least 26 people. Expressing solidarity, he said, “PM Modi and the incredible people of India have our full support and deepest sympathies.”","FBI director Kash Patel announced Tuesday the extradition of Muhammad Shahzeb Khan, a Pakistani citizen residing in Canada.

How Dave Portney’s vote is a reflection of his personal beliefs

Dave Portnoy on Trump, the 'manosphere' and 'Barstool conservatism' | Morning Edition | NPR

""How Many Jews Have To DIE?"" - Barstool’s Dave Portnoy EXPLODES Over Jew Joke BACKLASH





When Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy says he cast his vote for Donald Trump in the 2024 election, it resonated far beyond a simple political preference—it signaled deeper concerns about today’s cultural landscape. Portnoy, a self-made media mogul and known pizza critic, framed his choice not as wholehearted support for Trump, but as a statement against “woke politics” and what he sees as the denigration of hard-working men. His explanation has sparked both surprise and reflection, prompting a closer look at how modern cultural battles intertwine with political expression. This article takes a fresh perspective: exploring Portnoy’s vote as a cultural outlook, rooted in identity, values, and a growing movement known as “Barstool conservatism.”Portnoy shared his political rationale in a revealing NPR interview, stating, “It’s more an indictment of, I would say, the Democrats (than an) endorsement of Trump’s politics” . He added that he’s “pro-choice,” noting people assume that isn’t “a typical bro standpoint” . His remarks reflect frustration with left-leaning “blunt talk,” overemphasis on identity issues, and what he perceives as public shaming of men.Portnoy also critiqued Democrats’ messaging, saying their moral certainty alienates many, including hard-working independent men.This candid stance places him squarely in what’s become known as Barstool conservatism, a cultural-political identity championing libertarian views, male-centric pop culture, anti-woke attitudes, and pro-Trump leanings. Portnoy’s loyal fanbase—young, outspoken, and looking for authenticity—has gravitated toward this balance of counterculture and freedom.Yet, Portnoy’s support has its limits. He didn’t shy from criticizing President Trump’s tariff decisions, admitting losses up to $20 million, calling the market turbulence “tariff city”. Still, he remains impartial on policy, valuing governmental consistency and directness.Rooted in humble beginnings, Portnoy’s rise from Swampscott to Boston entrepreneur speaks to a self-made ethos. Barstool Sports began in 2003 as a free four-page zine, evolving into a digital media empire known for brash honesty and unapologetic content.Dave Portnoy’s vote for Trump offers more than a political headline—it exposes a cultural divide, highlighting a longing for no-nonsense values, work ethic, and pride untainted by public scorn. Whether you agree with his method or not, his stance taps into a powerful sentiment: many feel talked down to and overlooked. As the lines between culture, media, and politics blur, Portnoy’s act underscores the importance of understanding why people vote for what they perceive as an outlet, not just a candidate. In our charged era, this vote reminds us of one truth: identity, respect, and voice matter. And for many, they matter more than platform alone.","Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy says he cast his vote for Donald Trump in the 2024 election.

"‘Lal Salam’ in Srinagar: CPM demands restoration of Article 370, talks with Pakistan",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lal-salam-in-srinagar-cpm-demands-restoration-of-article-370-talks-with-pakistan/articleshow/121786407.cms,"'Kashmir To Kanyakumari Now Reality': PM Modi Flags Off Vande Bharat From Katra To Srinagar | J&K

SRINAGAR: Srinagar’s Tagore Hall reverberated with chants of ‘Lal Salam’ on Wednesday as CPM held a one-day convention calling for the restoration of Article 370 and initiation of dialogue with Pakistan.The convention stood out as a rare political event in Kashmir Valley, where even most of the regional parties have largely shifted discourse to demanding the restoration of statehood rather than raising the issue of restoring J&K’s special status.Addressing party workers at the event, titled ‘Convention for the Restoration of Legitimate Constitutional Rights of the People of Jammu and Kashmir’, CPM general secretary M Alexander Baby said the abrogation of Article 370, which granted special status to J&K, amounted to betrayal. “Before adding it into the Constitution of India, Article 370 was thoroughly deliberated upon and agreed to,” Baby said.He hit out at Union home minister Amit Shah for claiming that the abrogation of Article 370 had brought peace and development to Kashmir.Baby, accompanied by several party MPs and other functionaries, also visited border areas in Uri to assess the destruction caused by Pakistani shelling during Operation Sindoor.He said the compensation offered to affected residents was inadequate. “Govt is providing only Rs 1.3 lakh for damaged houses and residential structures. That amount is meagre,” he said, adding that party MPs would raise the issue in the Lok Sabha.The CPM leader, who also met family members of Adil Shah, the ponywallah killed in Pahalgam terror attack, said Kashmiris had been fighting terrorism for years, but the current administration had marginalised elected representatives of the state. During the security review meetings, it’s the LG, a nominee of the Centre, who chaired the meeting, while the elected chief minister Omar Abdullah was excluded, Baby said, adding that “this only emboldens the terrorists”.Baby asserted that terrorism must be fought, but war was not a solution. “Military options are limited. On May 7, certain steps were taken, but we must stop there and begin negotiations,” he said, calling for bilateral talks between India and Pakistan. Rejecting any third-party intervention, he said US President Donald Trump shouldn’t have any role.CPM leader from Kashmir, M Y Tarigami, also criticised the central govt for bifurcating J&K and stripping it of statehood and special status. “This is the only region in the country where such a reversal (from state to Union Territory) has happened. Elsewhere, UTs have been upgraded to full states,” Tarigami said.","Srinagar’s Tagore Hall reverberated with chants of ‘Lal Salam’ on Wednesday as CPM held a one-day convention.

'They can't have nuclear weapon': Why US is pulling troops from parts of Middle East; Trump’s Iran strike threat in focus,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/keeping-americans-safe-both-at-home-abroad-us-orders-drawdown-of-nonessential-personnel-in-middle-east-amid-rising-tensions-with-iran/articleshow/121787587.cms,"Why US pulled out troops from Middle East?







US President Donald Trump has ordered to pull out troops from from the potentially ""dangerous"" Middle East on Wednesday as nuclear negotiations appear to stall and regional instability looms. The State Department on Wednesday ordered the departure of all nonessential staff from the US Embassy in Baghdad, citing a commitment “to keeping Americans safe, both at home and abroad.” The embassy had already been operating with limited staff.""Well they are being moved out because it could be a dangerous place. We've given notice to move out and we'll see what happens."" Trump said, adding that ""they can't have a nuclear weapon, very simple. We're not going to allow that.""Additionally, the State Department is authorising the optional departure of nonessential personnel and family members from diplomatic posts in Bahrain and Kuwait. The US military is also following suit, with Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth approving the voluntary departure of military dependents from multiple locations across the region. US Central Command said it is “monitoring the developing tension.”White House spokesperson Anna Kelly noted that the decisions came after a regular review of American personnel abroad. “This decision was made as a result of a recent review,” she said.The move comes as efforts to revive the stalled US-Iran nuclear negotiations face fresh setbacks. Talks aimed at curbing Iran’s nuclear programme in exchange for sanction relief have reportedly reached a deadlock, with the next round—originally planned for this weekend in Oman—now in doubt. Two US officials, speaking anonymously, said it was increasingly unlikely the talks would go ahead.President Donald Trump offered a pessimistic assessment in a recent interview, saying he is “getting more and more less confident about” reaching a deal. “They seem to be delaying, and I think that's a shame,” he told the New York Post podcast Pod Force One.Iran, meanwhile, rejected threats of force. “Iran is not seeking a nuclear weapon, and US militarism only fuels instability,” its mission to the UN wrote online. Defence Minister Gen. Aziz Nasirzadeh added that if war were imposed, “the opponent's casualties will certainly be more than ours,” warning the US that its regional bases “are within our reach.”Separately, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors is considering a censure resolution against Iran, which could trigger the reimposition of UN sanctions under the still-active 2015 nuclear deal. The US withdrew from that deal during Trump’s first term.Amid the growing risk of conflict, the UK’s Maritime Trade Operations Centre warned ships to exercise caution in the Persian Gulf, Strait of Hormuz, and Gulf of Oman—areas where Iran has previously seized or attacked vessels.","The State Department ordered the departure of all nonessential staff from the US Embassy in Baghdad.

What did Dr Marya post?







Dr Rupa Marya, an Indian-American professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, has sued the university for suspending her for her social media posts about Israel's war in Gaza. Marya was placed on leave in September 2024 by the university in a statement that did not name Marya but said that it condemns ""tired and racist conspiracy theory"" that ""Zionist doctors were a threat to Arab, Palestinian, South Asian, Muslim and Black patients, as well as the US healthcare system.""Marya filed a lawsuit saying that she received rape and death threats and repeated harassment and threats because of her posts. She said suspending her violated her right to free speech. ""We all need to urgently speak up against these kinds of attacks on our basic rights to advocate for justice, and we expect the court will agree with us that Dr Marya’s rights have been violated and must be remedied,"" the lawsuit said.“As a medical doctor, American citizen and as a person of south Asian descent raised in the Sikh religious tradition, Dr Marya has long been concerned about American foreign policy, including in the Middle East and the issues surrounding the conflict between Israel and Palestine,”it said.In a September 2024 post, Marya wrote that her students were concerned that a first-year student from Israel may have served in the IDF. She asked if that meant he had participated in the genocide of Palestinians and asked her colleagues what to do about it.Senator Scott Wiener posted Dr Marya's post and said that Dr Marya was creating a toxic, hostile environment at the USCF by promoting the age-old antisemitic theory that Jewish doctors are harming patients. The post was later deleted. Wiener said this wasn’t the first time Marya has been accused of posting antisemitic content and said the professor has pushed the idea that Jewish doctors harm patients. The senator said she was “targeting a first-year med student for harassment b/c he’s Israeli. ”","Dr Rupa Marya, an Indian-American professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, has sued the university for suspending her for her social media posts.

Rockland county rigged for Trump? 2024 US election results under scrutiny; NY lawsuit moves forward,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/rockland-county-rigged-for-trump-2024-us-election-results-under-scrutiny-ny-lawsuit-moves-forward/articleshow/121772808.cms,"



A legal challenge questioning the accuracy of the 2024 election results in Rockland County, New York, is moving forward, according to a report by Newsweek.The lawsuit, filed by SMART Legislation, the legal advocacy arm of nonpartisan watchdog SMART Elections, raises concerns about vote counts and statistical anomalies in both the presidential and US Senate races.In May, New York Supreme Court Judge Rachel Tanguay ruled in open court that the allegations were serious enough to proceed to the discovery phase, where evidence will be formally gathered and reviewed.While the lawsuit is unlikely to affect the overall outcome—Congress has already certified President Donald Trump’s victory—it could reignite debate over election integrity.The complaint includes affidavits from voters who claim they voted for independent US Senate candidate Diane Sare, but their votes were not reflected in the certified count by the Rockland County Board of Elections.Additionally, Newsweek reports that the suit cites multiple voting districts where hundreds of voters selected Democratic Senate candidate Kirsten Gillibrand but allegedly cast no votes for Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee. These patterns raised red flags for analysts.Max Bonamente, a physics and statistics professor at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, said the results in four out of five Rockland County towns were “statistically highly unlikely” compared to the 2020 election.“These data would require extreme sociological or political causes for their explanation, and would benefit from further assurances as to their fidelity,” he wrote.Lulu Friesdat, SMART Legislation's founder, said, “There is clear evidence that the Senate results are incorrect, and there are statistical indications that the presidential results are highly unlikely. The best way to determine if the results are correct is to examine the paper ballots in a full public, transparent hand recount.”Costas Panagopoulos, a political science professor at Northeastern University, told Newsweek that such statistical irregularities deserve investigation, though they may stem from non-malicious sources like error or miscalculation.He emphasised that the discrepancies were not significant enough to alter the outcome but said reviewing them could strengthen trust in the electoral process.A hearing in the case is scheduled for September 22.The plaintiffs are demanding a full hand recount of the presidential and Senate ballots cast in Rockland County.","Lawsuit raises concerns about vote counts and statistical anomalies in both the presidential and US Senate races.

AGARTALA: In a chilling case that has sent shockwaves across Tripura, police have arrested six people on Wednesday, including a doctor and his parents, for the alleged murder of a 24-year-old man whose body was found stuffed inside a refrigerator in Gandacherra, Dhalai district.The crime reportedly occurred on June 8 night in Agartala and the body was recovered three days later.West Tripura district SP Kiran Kumar told reporters that the murder appears to have been driven by a love triangle involving the victim and the prime accused.The deceased, Sariful Islam, an electrician associated with the Agartala Smart City Project, was allegedly lured to the residence of doctor Dibakar Saha (29) in the Indranagar locality of the city under the pretext of receiving a gift. Upon arrival, Sariful found three others present — Animesh Yadav (21), Nabanit Das (25), and Jaydeep Das (20). Investigators believe the murder was premeditated.""Initial findings suggest that Dibakar Saha was in love with a woman who happened to be his cousin. The victim, Sariful, was also in a romantic relationship with the same woman. Jealousy and rivalry appear to be the primary motives behind the crime,"" SP Kumar said.According to the police, the group strangled Sariful to death and concealed his body in a trolley bag. The body was later moved to another location. On June 9, Saha's parents — Dipak Saha (52) and Debika Saha — allegedly arrived in Agartala from Gandacherra with a vehicle to assist in disposing of the body.

LUCKNOW: In a chilling rerun of the Meghalaya honeymoon murder case , a woman in Siddharthnagar district was arrested for killing her husband with the help of her lover and disposing of his body in the Rapti river.The couple was married for 18 years and had a 12-year-old son.Police said the accused, Sangeeta Devi (35), gave her husband, Kannan Kumar (48), poisoned prasad while returning from a temple visit.Along with her lover, Anil Shukla alias Vivek (27), who was eight years younger, she pushed his unconscious body off a 25-ft-high bridge into the Rapti near Kodari in Balrampur on June 2.After killing him, Sangeeta filed a missing person complaint on June 5 at Dhebarua police station and spent the next three days travelling with Anil. Later, when questioned, she failed to give concrete answers. Surveillance checked her mobile location, which was found to be with Kannan on June 2. When confronted with this evidence, she confessed and revealed Anil's involvement.Her 12-year-old son also told police, ""Papa went out with mummy and Anil uncle, but only mummy returned."" Meanwhile, Kannan's brother, Babu Lal, who suspected foul play due to the strained relationship between the couple, also filed a complaint suspecting his brother's murder and accusing his wife, Sangeeta.The body was found as a skeleton from the river on June 10, about 1.5 km downstream, and identified based on clothing. Police arrested both Sangeeta and Anil on the complaint registered by Babu Lal.Police circle officer, Shohratgarh, Sujeet Rai, who supervised the case, said that Sangeeta reportedly met Anil five years ago during a train journey. ""Their affair deepened, and Anil began frequenting her house. Though Kannan grew suspicious and confronted his wife, she dismissed the allegations as mere friendship. However, Sangeeta and Anil eventually planned the murder to remove Kannan from the equation,"" said Rai.During interrogation, Sangeeta confessed: ""We fed him poison during a trip to Vibhuti Nath temple in Shravasti.

LUCKNOW: Accused of plotting to murder her husband during their honeymoon, Sonam is said to have agreed to marry fearing for her ailing father's life.This facet came to light during interrogation of Lalitpur native Akash Rajput, who said Sonam feared her father would die of heart attack if she did not marry as per his wish. According to Rajput's statement, Sonam's father Devi Singh suffers from a serious heart condition, and she was reportedly convinced that her refusal to marry Raja would trigger a fatal heart attack.Despite her personal reluctance and reported feelings for another man, Sonam got married just to fulfil her father's wish and, to safeguard his health thereby. Investigators believe that soon after Sonam married Raja, her lover Raj Kushwaha got agitated by the union and police allege this resentment was at the root of the plot to eliminate Raja just five days after the wedding.Police said Rajput revealed the murder plan was hatched and discussed in a café located next to Sonam's residence near Nandbagh colony in Indore. This proximity raises further questions about the extent of Sonam's knowledge, if any, regarding the plan, although current police statements point at her coerced marriage as primary motive for her actions leading to the murder.Police are now working on corroborating Akash Rajput's testimony and are interrogating Raj Kushwaha, believed to be the central figure in the murder case.","Sonam is said to have agreed to marry fearing for her ailing father's life.

A mangalsutra and ring left behind by his wife, Sonam, raised suspicion.





NEW DELHI: A mangalsutra and a ring left behind in a suitcase proved to be the first vital clue that helped police crack the sensational murder of Indore businessman Raja Raghuvanshi, who was killed during his honeymoon in Meghalaya last month, Meghalaya DGP I Nongrang said on Wednesday.Raja (29) and his wife Sonam (25) had arrived in Meghalaya via Guwahati on May 20, just days after their May 11 wedding in Indore. On May 23, the couple vanished from Sohra (Cherrapunji) in East Khasi Hills after checking out of a homestay in Nongriat village.“We recovered Sonam's mangalsutra and a ring from the suitcase they left behind at a homestay in Sohra. A married woman leaving behind such symbols of marriage raised our suspicion and gave us a reason to pursue her as a suspect,” DGP Nongrang told PTI.Raja’s decomposed body was found in a gorge near Weisawdong Falls on June 2. Police launched a multi-state chase for Sonam, who eventually surfaced on June 9 — over 1,200km away — in Uttar Pradesh’s Ghazipur, where she surrendered before police.Police have also arrested Sonam’s alleged boyfriend Raj Kushwaha and three contract killers. All five have been remanded to eight days of police custody by a court in Shillong.According to a police officer involved in the probe, the couple had walked into the Sohra homestay on May 22 without any prior booking. Since they didn’t get a room and had plans to trek over 3,000 steps to Nongriat village to see the famed double-decker root bridge, they left their suitcase at the homestay and spent the night at another homestay in Nongriat.The next morning, they trekked back to Sohra, picked up their scooter and rode to Weisawdong Falls — the site where Raja was allegedly killed by three contract killers, reportedly in front of Sonam.Earlier, PTI had reported that a local tour guide had spotted the couple with three Hindi-speaking men on the trail back to Sohra, a detail that later turned out to be crucial in identifying the accused.“The accused have admitted to the crime. With all the evidence gathered, there is little room for denial,” a senior police officer said.",Raja Raghuvanshi and his wife were on honeymoon in Meghalaya. They left their suitcase at a homestay and trekked to Weisdong Falls. They were found dead in the gorge on June 2.

- Queues -

- 'Bit of renovation' -





The queue stretches all the way down the road. Tens of thousands of people are flocking to South Korea's historic Blue House before the new president moves his office back in.Ex-president Yoon Suk Yeol spurned the elegant compound in leafy northern Seoul claiming it was too ""imperial"". He opened it to the public in 2022, and moved into a hastily converted ministry instead.But with Yoon impeached over a failed martial law bid, newly elected Lee Jae-myung plans to move the seat of power back, triggering a frenzy of last-minute visits.""I figured if I missed this chance I would never get to come here,"" said Jang Myung-hee, 65, who visited with her friends.She said it was the ""right call"" for South Korea's leaders to resettle in the Blue House as it ""befits the nation's prestige"".""I can definitely feel this place is different.""The building is named for the approximately 150,000 hand-painted blue tiles that adorn its roof. Once occupied by former colonial power Japan, the site has housed South Korea's leaders for seven decades.On the campaign trail, Lee vowed to return.""It is traditional, symbolic and optimal,"" he told local media.Official figures show visitors to the Blue House surged ahead of the June 3 snap election: around 427,000 in May -- double the number from the same month last year.In all, more than 7.8 million people -- including 800,000 foreigners -- have visited since the site's May 2022 public opening.""I have come here with my kids for educational purposes, as it might be difficult for us to visit again,"" said Son Young-ah, 49.One woman, upon leaving the main gate muttered: ""With this exit, I may never be able to set foot here again.""In early 2018, during a period of warmer ties, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's sister visited the Blue House -- the first by the isolated country's ruling Kim family.""I look forward to seeing Pyongyang and Seoul come closer in the minds of Korean people,"" Kim Yo Jong wrote in the visitors' book.The Blue House has long been the subject of public fascination, fuelled in part by a series of misfortunes that have befallen past inhabitants, including assassinations, impeachments, corruption trials and imprisonments.Yoon's relocation may have been in part an effort to escape such a fate -- which some believe is linked to the feng shui of the site. But the change in premises failed to spare his presidency: he was impeached in April after his brief martial law declaration and now faces a criminal trial.Yoon's replacement had little interest in continuing to occupy the former Defence Ministry in central Seoul.The ministry is plagued by ""security issues such as wiretapping"" and lacks the privacy and seclusion of the Blue House, Lee has said.Not all sections of the storied compound -- including its administrative offices and an underground bunker -- have been opened to tourists.As such, the site ""would only require a bit of renovation to reopen,"" Choi Gi-il, a former presidential security aid, told AFP.He added that the main blue-tiled building was primarily for ceremonial purposes and hosting foreign dignitaries, making it less vulnerable to security breaches.No date has been announced for the return to Blue House, but visitors to the site felt it was imminent.""I held off coming here because I thought I could come here anytime,"" Kim Jong-chun, 71, told AFP. But he realised it was now or never after Lee's election.""I came here today for the first time to celebrate my birthday,"" he said. ""For the symbolisms it caries, I deeply support and welcome Lee's decision to return here.""","South Koreans flock to Blue House ahead of presidential return.

Mamata Banerjee Hates Hindus: BJP Fires Fresh Salvo at Bengal CM for Not Visiting Murshidabad

NEW DELHI: Security has been heightened in Maheshtala after the area witnessed violent clashes between a mob and the West Bengal Police on Wednesday.Five police personnel, including DC (Port) Harikrishna Pai, sustained injuries, while two government vehicles were damaged and a motorcycle was torched as officers attempted to quell clashes in the Rabindranagar-Akra area. To control the situation, police carried out a lathicharge and used tear gas.Violence broke out near Rabindranagar Police Station when a crowd began to gather and suddenly turned violent, attacking the outnumbered police with stones. Reinforcements arrived, and police used lathicharge and tear gas to disperse the mob. However, the crowd regrouped near Santoshpur and clashed with Kolkata Police, injuring officers, including DC (Port) Rai. Riot police, led by senior officers, chased and dispersed the mob, eventually restoring order. Security forces conducted patrols in the area, and top police officials oversaw the operation. Four people were arrested, and the injured officers are reported to be in stable condition.The clashes erupted due to a dispute over land ownership. Locals say tensions began when a 'tulsi mancha' was hastily built at a spot where a minority community member had a shop.The trader was away for Eid, and the other group claimed the shop was illegally built on temple land. Before authorities could intervene, protests from both sides escalated into violence, roadblocks, and attacks on police.Leader of opposition in state and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Suvendu Adhikari, however, claimed that the victims were Hindus and demanded deployment of central forces in the violence-hit area.""Several police personnel were injured in the violence, and many police vehicles were torched. We demand immediate deployment of central forces in the area to save and protect people,"" he said.""I have approached the SP of Diamond Harbour Police District and DGP @WBPolice so that today, I along with one MLA can visit Maheshtala under Rabindranagar Police Station to meet and express solidarity with the victims of the Hindu families and the affected Hindu shopkeepers who came under the attack of the Jihadis yesterday.

'No remorse whatsoever': Gangster Goldy Brar's cold confession on Sidhu Moosewala murder; a rival gang angle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-remorse-whatsoever-gangster-goldy-brars-cold-confession-on-sidhu-moosewalla-murder-a-rival-gang-angle/articleshow/121777663.cms,"Poll Do you believe that gang-related violence is a major issue in India today? Yes No

N EW DELHI: Canada-based gangster Goldy Brar justified killing popular Sidhu Moosewala by claiming that the popular Punjabi singer ""had to face the consequences of his actions. ""In a BBC documentary, it was revealed that Lawrence Bishnoi and Moosewala's relationship dated back a long time, and the dreaded gangster used to call the singer from jail, telling him he liked his music.""In his arrogance, he (Moosewala) made some mistakes that could not be forgiven,"" Brar told the BBC.""We had no option but to kill him. He had to face the consequences of his actions. It was either him or us. As simple as that,"" he added.Brar, who is also a member of Lawrence Bishnoi gang, said that the ""first dispute"" between Moosewala and Bishnoi began with a match of Kabaddi in a village in Punjab.Brar said that Moosewala had promoted the tournament which was organised by Bishnoi's rivals - the Bambiha gang.""That's a village our rivals come from. He was promoting our rivals. That's when Lawrence and others were upset with him. They threatened Sidhu and said they wouldn't spare him,"" Brar said.The dispute was resolved by an associate of Bishnoi Vicky Middukhera. Later, Middukhera was himself gunned down by gangsters in Mohali in August 2021, by which point, Bishnoi's hostility towards Sidhu Moosewala reached the point of no return.The Bambiha gang claimed responsibility for killing Middukhera. The police named Moosewala's friend and sometime manager Shaganpreet Singh on the charge sheet, citing evidence that Singh had provided information and logistical support to the gunmen. Singh later fled India and is believed to be in Australia. Moosewala denied any involvement.The Punjab police told the BBC there was no evidence linking Moosewala to the killing or any gang-related crime. But Moosewala was friends with Shaganpreet Singh, and he was never able to shake off the perception that he was aligned with the Bambiha gang — a perception that may have cost him his life.""Everyone knew Sidhu's role, the police investigating knew, even the journalists who were investigating knew. Sidhu mixed with politicians and people in power. He was using political power, money, his resources to help our rivals. We wanted him to face punishment for what he'd done. He should have been booked. He should have been jailed. But nobody listened to our plea,"" Brar said.""So we took it upon ourselves. When decency falls on deaf ears, it's the gunshot that gets heard. Law. Justice. There's no such thing,"" he says. ""Only the powerful can... (obtain) justice, not ordinary people like us,"" he added.He went on to say that even Vicky Middukhera's brother, despite being in politics, has struggled to get justice through India's judicial system.""He's a clean guy. He tried hard to get justice for his brother lawfully. Please call him and ask how that's going. I did what I had to do for my brother. I have no remorse whatsoever,"" he said.Shubhdeep Singh Sidhu, popularly known as Sidhu Moosewala, was shot dead in Punjab's Mansa district on May 29. He was killed when he, along with his friend and cousin, was travelling in a jeep to Jawahar Ke village in Mansa. Six shooters waylaid and sprayed bullets at him.After the killing, Goldy Brar, who is a member of the Lawrence Bishnoi gang, claimed responsibility for the act.According to the chargesheet filed in the Moosewala murder case, Goldy coordinated with the shooters and plotters, including Bishnoi and Bhagwanpuria. He allegedly arranged weapons, cash, cars, phones, mobile SIMs and shelters for the accused.","Sidhu Moosewala, popularly known as Sidhu Sidhu, was shot dead in Punjab's Mansa district on May 29.

BENGALURU: A week after the Bengaluru stampede, injured attendees questioned the rushed planning, app glitches and poor crowd control, saying both authorities and the public shared responsibility for the chaos.Rajesh MG, 26, said, “We cannot judge or blame anyone. What was the urgency to organise the event just a day after RCB winning its first IPL trophy? That caused people to overcrowd. We went to watch the roadshow first and then learned it was cancelled.”“The govt should have taken preventive measures and planned better law-and-order measures where the crowd was concentrated more. People also misbehaved,” he added.Police sources said about 50 notices for magisterial inquiry had been sent out. However, only 10-12 victims showed up. Another round of inquiry will be held on June 13 where officials will be called for making statements. A witness, Shamili, 25, said, “I’m not holding anyone responsible. We should have realised it was crowded and avoided it.”Syed Abu Jaffer, 22, recalled how the crowd was too large even for police to control. “The event was mismanaged. You saw (this coming) how the crowd was on the streets celebrating the win the previous night.Tickets for stadium seats should have been arranged as per capacity.”“They messed up the passes. Around 3.30pm, there was an announcement about tickets, and the app crashed. The crowd went out of control — and that was the main reason,” said Jaffer. “You cannot hold one person responsible for the tragedy. The crowd, too, needs to have civic sense,” he added.","A week after the Bengaluru stampede, injured attendees questioned the rushed planning, app glitches and poor crowd control.

Denmark's Parliament on Wednesday approved a bill to allow US military bases on Danish soil, a move that comes as President Donald Trump seeks to take control of the kingdom's semi-autonomous territory of Greenland.Critics say the vote ceded Danish sovereignty to the U.S. The legislation widens a previous military agreement, made in 2023 with the Biden administration, where US troops had broad access to Danish airbases in the Scandinavian country.The new parameters follow Trump's coveting of the strategic, mineral-rich Arctic island even as the US and Denmark are NATO allies.Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen, in a response to lawmakers' questions, wrote that Denmark would be able to terminate the agreement if the US tries to annex all or part of Greenland.Ninety-four lawmakers voted for the bill, with 11 against. The legislation now goes to Danish King Frederik X for his signature.Greenland's prime minister previously said US statements about the island have been disrespectful and it ""will never, ever be a piece of property that can be bought by just anyone.""","Critics say the vote ceded Danish sovereignty to the U.S. The legislation widens a previous military agreement, made in 2023 with the Biden administration.

US President Donald Trump received a mix of boos and cheers as he arrived in a tuxedo at the Kennedy Center for the opening night of ""Les Misérables"" in Washington.It was his first visit to the venue since becoming president again and came as he works to reshape the institution in his own way.While Trump and Melania stood above the audience, the muffled boos were mixed with people shouting, ""USA!

USA!""""We want to bring it back, and we want to bring it back better than ever,"" Trump said while walking the red carpet with first lady Melania Trump.The MAGA chief has shown a particular fondness for ""Les Misérables,"" which he has described as one of his favourite musicals. The song ""Do You Hear the People Sing?"" from the show has been played at some of his past events.The evening had a strong GOP presence. Several Trump allies were seen at the event, including Kennedy Center interim head Ric Grenell, Attorney General Pam Bondi, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and Vice President JD Vance with his wife Usha.Despite the buzz, some seats in the balcony and orchestra sections were noticeably empty. Reports suggested that some ""Les Misérables"" cast members may have boycotted the performance, reports the Washington Post.Trump responded to the possibility by saying, ""I couldn't care less.""Trump's visit comes as part of a larger move to assert control over the Kennedy Center.

Ballymena riots: Fires rage as protests over alleged assault fuel anti-immigrant unrest in Northern Ireland,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/ballymena-riots-fires-rage-as-protests-over-alleged-assault-fuel-anti-immigrant-unrest-in-northern-ireland/articleshow/121787639.cms,"



More than 30 police officers have been injured in Northern Ireland after two nights of violent rioting in Ballymena, triggered by the court appearance of two 14-year-old boys charged with the attempted sexual assault of a teenage girl.The unrest, which police described as “hate-fuelled acts and mob rule,” has targeted homes, businesses and vehicles prompting fears of further escalation across the region.The violence began Monday, shortly after the accused teens appeared in court and denied the charges through a Romanian interpreter. The case has inflamed anti-immigrant sentiments in the town of about 31,000 people, amplified by far-right social media accounts that celebrated the riots and shared live footage.By Tuesday night, police in Ballymena came under “sustained attack” from rioters using petrol bombs, bricks, and fireworks. Seventeen officers were injured that night alone, while by Wednesday, the total number of injured officers had risen to 32. A pregnant woman had to be evacuated from a burning home, local politician Sian Mulholland told BBC’s Good Morning Ulster.“People are waking up today feeling genuine fear for their lives and their livelihoods,” said Assistant Chief Constable Ryan Henderson of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).“We have seen a number of calls over social media for protest activity this evening... It can be difficult to assess how much and where that will be.”Clonavon Terrace, the epicentre of the unrest, was quiet by Wednesday afternoon, but its charred remains spoke volumes: smashed windows, burned-out furniture, and flags on homes identifying the nationalities of those inside. One sign read, “British household,” a symbol of fear within immigrant communities trying to avoid becoming targets.Police have declared the attacks on four homes, believed to be racially motivated, as hate crimes. “When I watch families having their doors kicked in who happen to be from our diverse communities, I have to call that out for the racist behaviour that it is,” Henderson said.The riots quickly spread beyond Ballymena. Protesters blocked roads and clashed with police in Belfast, Newtownabbey, and Carrickfergus. In response, officers in riot gear deployed water cannon and fired non-lethal rounds known as attenuated energy projectiles. Cars were set alight, bins torched, and masonry hurled at officers. Police are now requesting reinforcements from mainland Britain to cope with the unrest.Northern Ireland First Minister Michelle O’Neill called the attacks “abhorrent,” adding, “No one, now or ever, should feel the need to place a sticker on their door to identify their ethnicity just to avoid being targeted.”The British and Irish governments also condemned the violence. “This appalling violence and vandalism must cease immediately,” said UK Northern Ireland Minister Hilary Benn, warning that those responsible would face justice.","More than 30 police officers injured in two nights of violent rioting in Ballymena, Northern Ireland.

Arrest and detention

Legal arguments

No criminal charges, growing list of released activists





A federal judge on Wednesday ruled that Mahmoud Khalil, a legal US resident and former graduate student at Columbia University, must be released from immigration detention.Khalil was detained in March following his participation in campus pro-Palestinian demonstrations against Israel’s military action in Gaza.Judge Michael Farbiarz said that Khalil’s continued detention is causing him “irreparable harm,” citing damage to his career, personal life and free speech rights. “The Court finds as a matter of fact that the Petitioner’s career and reputation are being damaged and his speech is being chilled — and this adds up to irreparable harm,” the judge wrote in his ruling.Despite the decision, Khalil will remain in custody until at least 9:30 am Friday, allowing the US government time to file an appeal. He has also been asked to post a $1 bond before being released.Khalil was arrested on March 8 in the lobby of his university-owned residence. He was the first person to be detained under a Trump administration crackdown targeting international students involved in Gaza protests. Khalil is married to a US citizen and recently became a father.After his arrest, Khalil was moved across the country to a detention facility in Jena, Louisiana, far from his lawyers and family.His legal team, led by the City University of New York’s CLEAR project, challenged the detention as unconstitutional.“The court’s decision is the most significant vindication yet of Mahmoud’s rights,” said Ramzi Kassem, co-director of CLEAR. “But we aren’t out of the woods until Mahmoud is free and back home with his wife and child,"" they added.Judge Farbiarz previously said that efforts to expel Khalil based on foreign policy concerns were “likely unconstitutional.” The government has argued that Khalil’s presence could harm US foreign policy. US secretary of state Marco Rubio invoked that statute to justify the deportation, saying Khalil’s activism poses “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.”Khalil says he did nothing wrong and did not hide anything on his green card application. He told the court he only did a university-approved internship with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, and was not an officer, as the government claims.In court filings, Khalil said the government’s actions had already affected his career, with Oxfam International withdrawing a job offer due to the controversy. He also said the experience had discouraged him from engaging in future activism.Khalil was not arrested during the Columbia protests and has not been accused of any crimes. His public presence at the demonstrations drew attention from critics and the White House, which accused him of “siding with terrorists” without providing evidence.He had served as a negotiator and spokesperson for student protesters who camped on campus. Columbia University later called in police to clear the encampment after a building was occupied, though Khalil was not involved in that action.Other legal residents detained for similar activism have recently been released, including students from Tufts, Georgetown and a Palestinian student from Columbia.","Mahmoud Khalil, a legal US resident and former graduate student at Columbia University, must be released from immigration detention.

A French doctor who was aboard a humanitarian aid boat bound for Gaza has accused Israeli authorities of mistreating passengers, including Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, after the vessel was intercepted at sea.Dr Baptiste André, one of the 12 people on the Madleen, said passengers were mocked, deprived of sleep, and given limited access to food and water while in Israeli custody. “I don't have the legal qualifications to specify what happened, but there were acts of mistreatment,” he told reporters upon arriving in France.The Madleen, organised by the pro-Palestinian Freedom Flotilla Coalition, departed from Italy on June 1 to deliver humanitarian supplies to Gaza amid a worsening blockade.

An independent United Nations commission said on Tuesday Israeli attacks on schools, religious and cultural sites in Gaza amount to war crimes and the crime against humanity of seeking to exterminate Palestinians.""Israel has obliterated Gaza's education system and destroyed over half of all religious and cultural sites in the Gaza Strip,"" the UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the occupied Palestinian territory said in a report.It accused Israeli forces of ""war crimes, including directing attacks against civilians and wilful killing, in their attacks on educational facilities that caused civilian casualties.""In killing civilians sheltering in schools and religious sites, Israeli security forces committed the crime against humanity of extermination,"" the report said.It noted: ""While the destruction of cultural property, including educational facilities, was not in itself a genocidal act, evidence of such conduct may nevertheless infer genocidal intent to destroy a protected group.""The commission urged the Israeli government to stop attacking cultural, religious and educational institutions.It called on Israel to ""immediately end its unlawful occupation of Palestinian territory"", cease all settlement activity and comply fully with provisional measures ordered by the International Court of Justice.In January 2024, the world's top court ordered Israel to take all measures ""to prevent and punish the direct and public incitement to commit genocide against people in Gaza"" and to allow for urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance there.Tuesday's report paid special attention to Gaza but also focused on Israeli attacks on civilians in the occupied Palestinian territories as a whole, including East Jerusalem, and in Israel.","An independent United Nations commission said on Tuesday Israeli attacks on schools, religious and cultural sites in Gaza amount to war crimes.

Arabs EXPOSE Netanyahu's True Aim Behind Hostage Talks Lie | 'Only Interested In Power'

Future plan to end decades-old middle east conflict:







Ehud Olmert, former prime minister of Israel, has blamed the current PM, Benjamin Netanyahu , for failing to prevent the October 7, 2023 attacks by the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which triggered a deadly war in the middle east.In an interview with AFP, Olmert said that US President Donald Trump must intervene in the current situation and tell Netanyahu, “enough is enough.” He asserted that the United States has more influence on the Israeli government “than all the other powers put together,” and that Trump could “make a difference.”“This is it. I hope he (Trump) will do it. There is nothing that cannot happen with Trump. I don't know if this will happen. We have to hope, and we have to encourage him,” the former prime minister added.The US has remained a key ally of Israel. It has approved billions of dollars for selling weapons and military equipment to Israel, often using its veto power in the UN to shield Israel from international pressure.Olmert served as prime minister of Israel from 2006 to 2009.He also suggested that Israel should denounce the continuation of the war in Gaza as a ""crime"" and insisted that a two-state solution is the only way to end the conflict.He added that while the international community initially accepted Israel's argument of responding to the October 7 attacks as an act of self-defense, this perception shifted when Netanyahu, instead of ending the war in March, chose to intensify military actions in Gaza.Netanyahu ""has his personal interests, which are prioritized over what may be the national interests,"" Olmert charged.""If there is a war that is not going to save hostages, that cannot really do more than what has already been done against Hamas—and if, as a result, soldiers are getting killed, hostages may be killed, and innocent Palestinians are being killed—then, to my mind, this is a crime,"" Olmert said.""And this is something that should be condemned and not accepted,"" he added.The Hamas attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,219 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures. The Palestinian militants abducted 251 hostages, 54 of whom remain in Gaza, including 32 the Israeli military says are dead.Olmert, along with former Palestinian foreign minister Nasser Al-Qidwa, is planning to end decades of conflict between Israel and the Palestinians by creating a Palestinian state alongside a secure Israel.According to the plan, both sides would swap 4.4 per cent of land. Israel would retain some parts of the West Bank where Israeli settlers already live. In exchange, the Palestinians would receive territory for a future Palestinian state that is currently part of Israel.Ahead of a meeting this month in New York, co-hosted by France and Saudi Arabia on steps toward recognizing a Palestinian state, Olmert said the plan is “practical, doable, relevant, valid, and real.”Al-Qidwa, who will present the plan with Olmert at a conference in Paris on Tuesday organized by the Jean-Jaurès Foundation think tank, told AFP that the proposal is “the only realistic and workable solution.”However, he said people in both Israel and the Palestinian territories still need to be convinced—especially while the war continues.“The moment the war comes to an end, we will see a different kind of thinking. We have to move forward with the acceptance of coexistence between the two sides,” he said.He also noted that serious progress is not possible under the current Israeli government or the Palestinian leadership, led by President Mahmud Abbas, who has been in power for 20 years.“You have to get rid of both. And that is going to happen,” he added, calling the Palestinian leadership “corrupt and ineffective.”","Ehud Olmert, former prime minister of Israel, has blamed the current PM, Benjamin Netanyahu, for failing to prevent the October 7, 2023 attacks by Hamas.

As children chased pigeons and old men murmured under poplar trees in Yerevan's central square, unease hung in the air.Armenia is divided over what more it must surrender for a shot at lasting peace with Azerbaijan.Azerbaijan has demanded sweeping concessions from its arch foe as part of a deal to end decades of hostility and conflict between the Caucasus rivals.Despite the tranquil scenes of a warm spring day, the issue has stirred worry in a fragile Armenian society, still reeling from a humiliating military defeat in 2023.Life ""is full of uncertainty"", said Nare Barseghyan, a 25-year-old philologist.""We have a divided society, toxic politics and a growing disrespect for our country,"" she added.""People shouldn't be constantly threatened that there will be a new war if we don't yield to Azerbaijani demands,"" she said.- Exodus -Since the break-up of the Soviet Union, the Caucasian neighbours have fought several wars for control of the Karabakh region, which was historically part of Armenia.Officially recognised as part of Azerbaijan, it was ruled by pro-Armenian separatists for three decades.Azerbaijan recaptured it in a lighting 24-hour offensive in 2023, prompting more than 100,000 ethnic Armenians to flee the mountainous enclave.The defeat and exodus have deepened Armenia's political divisions and sparked street protests over the government's handling of the crisis.Seeking to move beyond the conflict, Baku and Yerevan agreed in March on the text of a broader peace treaty, hailed by some as a possible turning point in relations.But Azerbaijan is asking, among other demands, for Armenia to first amend its constitution to formally drop any territorial claims to Karabakh -- a move that would sever its bond with a region perceived by Armenians as their ancestral homeland.Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan has signalled his readiness to comply for the sake of a lasting peace, announcing plans for a constitutional referendum in 2027.- 'No security' -The loss of Karabkah has splintered Armenian society.""Some believe the issue of Artsakh is closed but most do not -- because no nation can so easily give up a part of its homeland,"" said Robert Matevosyan, 52, using the Armenian name for Karabakh.""You can't close that chapter when every day you see people from Artsakh who've lost everything,"" he added, referring to the Karabakh refugees who rushed to the relative safety of Armenia.Matevosyan, a softly spoken engineer and part-time tour guide, is from Syunik, a southern Armenian region that borders Azerbaijan.When he returns to his village of Kapan, with Azerbaijani military posts just a few hundred metres away, he said he feels the tension in the air.""There is no security. Only the illusion of it,"" he told AFP.He does not want Armenia to change its constitution ""under threat from Azerbaijan"".""If anyone thinks this will bring peace, they're wrong. Azerbaijan doesn't want peace,"" he said.Such doubts are widespread across Armenian society, where Pashinyan's proposed constitutional referendum dominates public discourse.""The constitution shouldn't be changed under external pressure,"" said Karine Hambardzumyan, a 65-year-old physicist.""I don't want to build my life under someone else's threats. Let it be hard, let it be difficult -- but let it be our choice.""- 'Retake' Karabakh -Many in Armenia still harbour hopes of one day reclaiming Karabakh.""We should first build a strong country,"" Hambardzumyan said. ""Then we will retake Artsakh.""Musician Vahan Artsruni, 59, struck a similar note.""We can bring Artsakh back -- not now, maybe, but in time. If we are united,"" he said.""I feel the same spirit I felt 30 years ago,"" when Armenian forces took control of Karabakh following the Soviet Union's collapse.He dismissed the constitutional debate as ""one of many false agendas pushed by the government"" and said he was not worried about the result.""Given the extremely low level of trust in the government, it's already clear that even if the issue reaches a referendum, it won't pass,"" he said.","Armenia is divided over what more it must surrender for a shot at lasting peace with Azerbaijan.

‘IAEA Resolution Politically Biased, Could Kill All Nuclear Diplomacy’: Iran’s New Threat To West

Iran STUNS U.S., Tells 'DOUBTFUL' Trump Nuclear Deal Possible | 'Lift Sanctions, Allow Enrichment'





Iran's foreign ministry has said a new round of nuclear talks with the United States is being planned for Sunday, after President Donald Trump said it was expected on Thursday.""The next round of Iran-US indirect talks is being planned for next Sunday in Muscat,"" foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said in a statement Tuesday, adding foreign minister and chief negotiator Abbas Araghchi would this week attend the Norway's Oslo Forum, a gathering of conflict mediators.Iran and the United States have held five rounds of talks since April to thrash out a new nuclear deal to replace the 2015 accord with major powers that Trump abandoned during his first term in 2018.On May 31, after the fifth round of talks, Iran said it had received ""elements"" of a US proposal for a nuclear deal, with Araghchi later saying the text contained ""ambiguities"".Iran said on Monday the US proposal was ""lacking elements"" reflective of the previous negotiations and that it would present a ""reasonable, logical and balanced"" counter-proposal to the United States through mediator Oman.Trump has said new US-Iran talks this week could clarify if a nuclear deal is possible to avoid military action.He added that the latest meeting with Iran was expected Thursday, although a source familiar with preparations said it would more likely be on Friday or Saturday.Iran and the United States have recently been locked in a diplomatic standoff over Iran's uranium enrichment, with Tehran defending it as a ""non-negotiable"" right and Washington calling it as a ""red line"".Iran currently enriches uranium to 60 percent, far above the 3.67 percent limit set in the 2015 deal and close though still short of the 90 percent needed for a nuclear warhead.Western countries, including the United States, have long accused Iran of seeking to acquire atomic weapons, while Tehran insists its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes.","Iran and the United States have held five rounds of talks since April to thrash out a new nuclear deal to replace the 2015 accord with major powers that Trump abandoned during his first term in 2018.

Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg and 11 other international volunteers were detained on Monday evening after their aid ship, the Madleen, was intercepted by Israeli forces and brought to the port of Ashdod.The group had been trying to deliver humanitarian supplies to Gaza when their boat was stopped in international waters, according to organizers.Upon arrival in Israel, the activists underwent medical checks. Israel’s foreign ministry confirmed their detention, while defence minister Israel Katz said the group was shown footage of the Hamas-led October 7 attack on Israel.Defense minister Katz said they were shown a screening of ""the horror film documenting the October 7 massacre"" by Hamas, but ""when they saw what it was about, they refused to continue watching."" He accused Thunberg and others of ignoring Hamas atrocities by ""closing their eyes to the truth.""The Madleen was organised by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition (FFC), a group known for challenging Israel’s blockade on Gaza.The ship carried baby formula, food, and medical supplies meant for civilians in the war-torn territory.According to the FFC, Israeli forces used quadcopters to spray the deck with a white, paint-like substance, jam communications, and play disturbing sounds.In a livestream, one activist said the substance was irritating her eyes.Thunberg, in a pre-recorded video later posted by the group, said the ship had been “kidnapped in international waters by Israeli occupation forces.”Israeli authorities say the aid will be redirected to Gaza through official humanitarian channels. But FFC organizer and lawyer Huwaida Arraf said the interception violated international law and ignored a binding ruling from the International Court of Justice that calls for unrestricted humanitarian access to Gaza.Amnesty International echoed that concern. Its Secretary General Agnes Callamard said the nighttime operation in international waters was dangerous and unlawful.US President Donald Trump also commented on the incident, calling Thunberg “a strange, young, angry person” and sarcastically suggesting she take an “anger management class.” Still, he criticized the interception, saying, “Israel has enough problems without kidnapping Greta Thunberg.”Hamas called the operation a “flagrant violation of international law” and demanded the activists’ immediate release. In Ashdod, around 15 protesters gathered with placards reading “Resist genocide” and “Stop state terror.”France confirmed that six of the detainees are French citizens and said President Emmanuel Macron has requested their quick return. The French foreign ministry also called on Israel to allow large-scale humanitarian aid into Gaza without delay.The Madleen had left Sicily last week and had previously rescued four migrants off the coast of Libya during its journey. The FFC said the activists knew the risks, noting past flotillas had been attacked or blocked by Israel. In April, another flotilla vessel was allegedly hit by a drone near Malta, though Israel did not comment.Despite global pressure, only limited aid has reached Gaza. A UN-backed report in April warned that one in five people in Gaza faces starvation. The FFC said the seized shipment contained vital baby formula and medical supplies.Israel maintains a strict blockade on Gaza, especially during wartime, and has said unauthorized sea access to the territory will not be allowed.","Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg and 11 other international volunteers were detained on Monday evening after their aid ship, the Madleen, was intercepted by Israeli forces.

KHAN YOUNIS: The Israeli army said on Sunday it had retrieved the body of Hamas’ military chief Mohammed Sinwar in an underground tunnel beneath a hospital in southern Gaza, following a targeted operation last month.Another senior Hamas member, Mohammad Shabana, commander of the Rafah Brigade, was also found dead at the scene along with a number of other militants, who are still being identified, said IDF spokesperson, brigadier General Effie Defrin.Israeli forces gave a small group of foreign reporters a tour of the tunnel that had been uncovered beneath the European Hospital in Khan Younis, which Defrin said was a major command and control compound for Hamas.“We found underneath the hospital, right under the emergency room, a compound of a few rooms. In one of them we found, we killed Mohammed Sinwar,” he said.Hamas has not commented on reports of the death of either Sinwar or Shabana.Sinwar was the younger brother of Yahya Sinwar, Hamas’s deceased leader and mastermind of the Oct 2023 attack on Israel. Shabana played a key role in constructing the network of tunnels under Rafah. During the search of the site, Israeli forces also recovered weapon stockpiles, ammunition, cash and documents that are now being reviewed for intelligence value.Credit:","Mohammed Sinwar was the younger brother of Yahya Sinwar, Hamas’s deceased leader and mastermind of the Oct 2023 attack on Israel.

Why it matters









Federal Law No. 3 of 2016 – known as Wadeema’s Law – outlines what names are legally acceptable for children born in the UAE.A recent viral social media post has brought fresh attention to a lesser-known but important law in the UAE: naming regulations for newborns under Federal Law No. 3 of 2016, widely known as Wadeema’s Law.This law, introduced in memory of Wadeema, a child whose tragic death sparked national outrage, was enacted to protect children’s rights across all areas of life in the UAE. Among its many provisions is a clear guideline on how children may be named at birth.According to Article 8 of Wadeema’s Law, “A child has the right from birth to a name that does not imply humiliation or insult to their dignity and is not contrary to religious beliefs or social customs.”This means parents in the UAE are legally prohibited from giving a child a name that could be deemed:The law does not list banned names explicitly, but the language makes it clear: the choice of a name must align with social respect, cultural norms, and religious sensitivity.The law contains several other critical rights that cover a child’s identity and legal status in the UAE. These include:Every child has the right to life and personal safety, and the state guarantees the child’s growth, development, and care in accordance with the law.A child must be registered immediately after birth in the official births register in line with the applicable legal system.A child has the right to acquire a nationality, according to the laws in force within the UAE.Every child has the right to legal parentage and family affiliation. The child must be affiliated with their lawful parents under prevailing national laws.In addition, both parents or the child’s legal guardian are required to obtain all necessary legal documents related to the child’s birth, identity, and nationality. This includes:While naming a child might seem like a personal choice, the UAE government sees it as part of the child’s fundamental dignity and legal identity. By regulating names, Wadeema’s Law ensures that no child is burdened with a name that could affect their self-worth, cultural belonging, or legal standing.This renewed public attention serves as a timely reminder to parents and guardians to be fully aware of their legal responsibilities, not just in caring for a child, but in safeguarding their identity from day one.","Federal Law No. 3 of 2016 – known as Wadeema’s Law – outlines what names are legally acceptable for children born in the UAE.

Israel's ultra-Orthodox Shas party on Monday threatened to bring down Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's government by backing a motion for early elections amid a row over military service.Netanyahu's coalition, one of the most right-wing in Israel's history, is at risk of collapsing over a bill that could reverse the long-standing exemption from the draft for ultra-Orthodox Jews.The exemption is facing growing pushback as Israel wages war on Palestinian Islamist militants Hamas in Gaza.Netanyahu is under pressure from within his Likud party to draft more ultra-Orthodox men and impose penalties on draft dodgers -- a red line for Shas.The party is demanding legislation to permanently exempt its followers from military service and gave Netanyahu two days to find a solution.""We don't want to bring down a right-wing government, but we've reached our limit,"" Shas spokesperson Asher Medina told public radio.""If there's no last-minute solution (on conscription), we'll vote to dissolve the Knesset,"" he said, referring to the Israeli parliament.Last week, a Shas source told AFP the party was threatening to quit the coalition unless a solution was reached by Monday.The opposition is seeking to place a bill to dissolve parliament on Wednesday's plenary agenda, hoping to capitalise on the ultra-Orthodox revolt to topple the government.Netanyahu's coalition, formed in December 2022, includes Likud, far-right factions and ultra-Orthodox parties. A walkout by the latter would end its majority.A poll published in March by right-wing daily Israel Hayom found 85 percent of Israeli Jews support changing the conscription law for Haredim.Forty-one percent backed compulsory military service -- currently 32 months for men -- for all eligible members of the community.",Israel's ultra-Orthodox Shas party on Monday threatened to bring down Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government.
