"Why’d you ignore ED summons, Supreme Court asks Arvind Kejriwal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/whyd-you-ignore-ed-summons-supreme-court-asks-arvind-kejriwal/articleshow/109704454.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday questioned Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal for not appearing before Enforcement Directorate despite repeated summons after he argued that his arrest was illegal as the agency took the step without recording his statement.“Are you not contradicting yourself by saying that your statement under Section 50 of Prevention of Money Laundering Act ( PMLA ) was not recorded? You don't appear on summons for recording of statement under Section 50 and then you say it was not recorded,"" a bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta told senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who appeared for Kejriwal.Singhvi said non-cooperation by an accused in a probe could not be a ground for arrest and non-appearance following summons was not an admission of guilt. Questioning the timing of the arrest, he said the case was registered one-and-a-half years ago but Kejriwal was arrested after dates of the general elections were announced. He said the CM’s name did not figure in the first nine statements given by other accused and but the name cropped up in the 10th statement and that became the ground for arrest.Pitching his arguments on political lines, Singhvi said of the three approvers in the case, one joined the central governing party (BJP), the second joined the party’s ally TDP and the third contributed to the party through electoral bonds.When the bench asked him why Kejriwal had not filed an application for bail in the trial court, Singhvi said the CM had challenged his arrest, which had wider jurisdiction. Responding to ED’s statement that the CM had accepted the remand ordered by the trial court, the lawyer clarified that when the arrest itself was under challenge, there was no question of accepting the remand.Singhvi pointed out that on April 16, 2023, Kejriwal appeared before CBI in connection with the case and answered all queries.Countering ED's submission that the CM could not be given special privilege, Singhvi said a CM had no less rights than a normal accused.The hearing remained inconclusive and will continue on Tuesday.In its reply affidavit filed in the apex court, ED had said Kejriwal was the kingpin and key conspirator of the Delhi excise scam and had demanded kickbacks for changing the policy.Accusing the Centre of ""misusing"" ED to ""crush"" its political opponents ahead of general elections, Kejriwal in his affidavit told the court that his arrest was “illegal, arbitrary and an unprecedented assault on the tenets of democracy based on free and fair elections and federalism”.On April 9, Delhi High Court had upheld Kejriwal's arrest and said there was no illegality about it and that ED was left with ""little option"" after he skipped repeated summonses and refused to join the investigation.",Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal argued that his arrest was illegal as the agency took the step without recording his statement.

(With NYT inputs)

NEW YORK: Dozens of protesters took over a building at Columbia University in New York early Tuesday, barricading entrances and unfurling a Palestinian flag from a window in the latest escalation of demonstrations against the Israel-Hamas war on college campuses across the US. The school promised they would face expulsion .The occupation at Columbia — where protesters shrugged off an ultimatum to abandon a tent encampment Monday or be suspended — unfolded as other universities stepped up efforts to clear out encampments.Police swept through some campuses, spurring confrontations with protesters and plenty of arrests. In rarer instances, university officials and protest leaders have struck agreements to restrict the disruption to campus life.Protesters on Columbia’s campus locked arms in front of Hamilton Hall early Tuesday and carried furniture and metal barricades to the building, video footage showed. Posts on an Instagram page for protest organisers shortly after midnight urged people to protect the encampment and join them. A “Free Palestine” banner hung from a window. Hamilton Hall is an academic building that opened in 1907 and is named after Alexander Hamilton, who attended King’s College, Columbia’s original name.The takeover occurred nearly 12 hours after Monday’s 2pm EST deadline for the protesters to leave an encampment of around 120 tents or face suspension. On Tuesday, Columbia spokesperson Ben Chang said, “Students occupying the building face expulsion.” He said those who didn’t agree to the terms from Monday were being suspended. “Protesters have chosen to escalate to an untenable situation — vandalising property”. Columbia administrators closed the Manhattan campus Tuesday to everyone but students who live in dorms there and employees who provide essential services. There was just one access point into and out of campus. New York police department chief Jeffrey Maddrey, speaking at a news conference, said police won’t enter Columbia’s campus without a request from the college administration or an imminent emergency. Protesters insisted they will remain at the hall until the university agrees to three demands: divestment, financial transparency and amnesty.At many campuses, including Columbia, the conflict over protests appeared to be coming to a head. The standoffs have drawn concern from the White House. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said Prez Biden believes students occupying an academic building is “absolutely the wrong approach,” and “not an example of peaceful protest”.Police had begun arresting demonstrators at California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt, where they had occupied a building for more than a week. At Portland State University in Oregon, students have taken over a library. Yale authorities cleared a protesters’ encampment after students heeded final warnings. Demonstrators said they were moving their gathering to a sidewalk area. The encampment was set up Sunday, six days after police arrested 44 students.Dozens of people were arrested Monday during protests at universities in Texas, Utah, Virginia and New Jersey.

Blockade lasted less than a day.",Dozens of protesters took over a building at Columbia University in New York early Tuesday. They unfurled a Palestinian flag from a window in the latest escalation of demonstrations against the Israel-Hamas war on college campuses across the US.

New York City police officers stormed Columbia University late Tuesday evening in a move to end a pro-Palestinian protest that has paralyzed the Ivy League institution for nearly two weeks. The intervention by the authorities came hours after Mayor Eric Adams declared that the demonstration ""must end now.""Television footage captured dozens of police officers, equipped with riot gear, entering the university grounds around 9 p.m., where they approached the heavily barricaded Hamilton Hall .This action was part of efforts to disperse protesters who had earlier in the day taken over the building, declaring it ""Hind's Hall"" in memory of a Palestinian child killed in Gaza.The situation escalated quickly as the officers, wearing helmets and carrying shields and zip ties, moved to clear the protesters who had occupied Hamilton Hall and set up barricades. Onlookers, including many students , jeered with chants of ""Shame! shame!"" as the scene unfolded.Earlier in the day, Columbia University had issued a stern warning to the occupiers, threatening expulsion and severe academic sanctions. The protests , which began as a response to ongoing military actions in Gaza, had spread across the US, affecting numerous other universities.Mayor Adams and NYPD officials had pointed to ""outside agitators"" as instigators of the unrest, a claim that was contested by protest leaders. Despite the tensions, the police emphasized that their intervention was a last resort to prevent the situation from deteriorating further.The demonstration at Columbia is part of a larger wave of campus protests nationwide, sparked by Israel’s offensive in Gaza following a deadly attack by Hamas militants. These protests have stirred significant debate over academic freedom, the right to protest, and the impact on campus safety.As the academic year approaches its end, and with commencement ceremonies on the horizon, university administrators nationwide are under increasing pressure to resolve these disruptions amicably. Meanwhile, the debate over the protests' implications for free speech and security continues to unfold both on and off campus.The protests initially targeted the financial and institutional ties to companies involved in the conflict in Gaza, demanding divestment and greater transparency. As the demonstrations grew, they also highlighted broader issues related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, leading to heightened tensions and polarized opinions within the academic community and beyond.The crackdown at Columbia marks a critical point in the ongoing campus protests, as law enforcement steps in to enforce peace and maintain order, while balancing the rights of students to engage in peaceful advocacy and protest.(With inputs from agencies)","New York City police officers stormed Columbia University late Tuesday evening in a move to end a pro-Palestinian protest.

The judge overseeing Donald Trump 's criminal hush money trial fined the former U.S. president $9,000 for contempt of court on Tuesday and said he would consider jailing him if he continued to violate a gag order.In a written order, Justice Juan Merchan said the fine may not be enough to serve as a deterrent for the wealthy businessman-turned-politician and lamented he did not have the authority to impose a higher penalty.""Defendant is hereby warned that the Court will not tolerate willful violations of its lawful orders and that if necessary and appropriate under the circumstances, it will impose an incarceratory punishment,"" Merchan wrote.Merchan had imposed the gag order to prevent Trump from criticizing witnesses and others involved in the case.The judge fined Trump $1,000 for each of nine online statements that he said violated his order not to criticize witnesses or other participants in the trial. Prosecutors had flagged 10 posts as possible violations.The posts, made between April 10 and April 17, included an article calling his former lawyer Michael Cohen a ""serial liar."" Cohen is expected to be a prominent witness in the trial.Another post quoted a Fox News pundit who claimed ""undercover liberal activists"" were trying to sneak onto the jury. Merchan rejected Trump's argument that he could not be held liable for ""reposts"" of material he did not write himself.Merchan will consider whether to impose further penalties for other statements at a hearing on Thursday. The judge also ordered Trump to remove the statements from his Truth Social account and his campaign website on Tuesday.Trump said Merchan had taken away his free speech rights. ""I am the only Presidential Candidate in History to be GAGGED. This whole 'Trial' is RIGGED,"" he wrote on Truth Social.Trump's lawyer Todd Blanche has argued that the statements at issue were responses to political attacks, but Merchan noted that Blanche was unable to provide any evidence that the expected witnesses had attacked Trump before he insulted them.The $9,000 fine, due by Friday, is a relatively small penalty for Trump, who has already posted $266.6 million in bonds as he appeals civil judgments in two other cases.Imprisonment, however, would be an unprecedented twist in the first criminal trial of a former U.S. president.If that happened, it is unclear whether Trump would be sent to New York City's jail on Rikers Island or whether security concerns would require more lenient treatment, such as home confinement in his Trump Tower triplex. As a former president, he remains under Secret Service protection.Trump, the Republican candidate in the 2024 presidential election is charged with falsifying business records to conceal a $130,000 payment to porn star Stormy Daniels in exchange for her silence about a sexual encounter she said she had with Trump in 2006.Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied having sex with Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford.Lawyer Keith Davidson, who worked with Daniels to sell her story, said interest picked up in 2016 after audio from the ""Access Hollywood"" TV show was released that portrayed Trump making crude remarks about women.Davidson had previously sold the story of another woman who claimed to have had an affair with Trump, former Playboy model Karen McDougal, to the National Enquirer tabloid.He said he leveraged an offer from the ABC television network, which he said promised efforts to feature her as a contestant on the ""Dancing With the Stars"" show.The Enquirer never ran McDougal's story, in a practice known as ""catch and kill"" that Davidson said was meant to protect Trump.The Enquirer's former publisher, David Pecker, testified last week that he used the Enquirer to suppress negative stories about Trump ahead of the 2016 election.Trump has denied having an affair with McDougal.Trump is required to attend the trial and has said he could instead be campaigning ahead of his rematch with Democratic President Joe Biden in the Nov. 5 election.The criminal case is one of four pending against Trump, but could be the only one to go to trial and result in a verdict before the election.","Donald Trump fined $1,000 for each of nine online statements that he said violated his order not to criticize witnesses or other participants in the trial.

He also tripped over his words at least 118 times during statements, speeches, or comments. White House staff have had to make corrections to official transcripts in order to align the president's words with public policy stances or to change the meaning of his statements entirely, according to a report from AFP.In some cases, Biden has misidentified leaders of other countries, such as France, Egypt, and Mexico, or has given the wrong names or titles for people, places, or groups at least 20 times during his remarks.Notably, during a recent speech at the North America’s building trades unions national legislative conference, Biden , reading from a teleprompter, omitted a scripted “pause” which was later rectified.The White House staff have also edited in words to appease their coalition or to reflect Biden's stated reasoning for decisions, such as his Supreme Court nominations and his choice of Vice President Kamala Harris.The president has also struggled with numbers, falsely inflating spending by the executive branch or efforts to vaccinate Americans against COVID-19.Errors in his State of the Union Address, where he mistakenly claimed “every American voted against” his 2021 American Rescue Plan, have also been rectified.Biden made several notable flubs, including accidentally stating support for ""threats to democracy"" and mispronouncing the name of a Georgia nursing student who was killed by an illegal migrant.The White House transcript included 13 emendations to Biden's speech, while none were made to former President Donald Trump 's last address to Congress in February 2020.The mixups amended by Biden's staff do not include dubious suggestions about his personal history or career in public service, such as his recent claim that cannibals ate his uncle during World War II.While Trump also made some verbal missteps during his presidency, the analysis found that he stumbled over less significant words and did so less frequently compared to Biden.","Biden has misidentified leaders of other countries, such as France, Egypt, and Mexico, or has given the wrong names or titles for people, places, or groups at least 20 times during his remarks.

NEW DELHI: South Dakota governor Kristi Noem, a contender for Donald Trump 's vice presidential running mate, has ignited controversy with revelations from her forthcoming memoir. In her book, she details the decision to euthanize an ""untrainable"" dog, causing uproar among animal lovers and political commentators alike. This incident has brought her under severe scrutiny, blending personal actions with public political consequences.The disclosure comes at a crucial time as Noem is considered for a high-profile role in the upcoming presidential elections .The act of killing her family dog, described in her own words, has sparked a national conversation about ethics and leadership, reflecting the broader societal values towards animals and the responsibilities of public figures.Elected as South Dakota's first female governor in 2018.Served in the US House of Representatives starting in 2010.A rancher, farmer, and small business owner.Published author, with her latest book detailing personal and political insights.Considered as a vice-presidential candidate alongside Donald Trump for the 2024 elections.Known for not shying away from contentious issues and decisions.Describes herself as a family-oriented person, managing both a public and private life on her ranch.Involved in decisions concerning animal welfare on her ranch, including the euthanasia of livestock.Actively engages with the public and media through social platforms.Faces mixed reactions from the public, balancing support from her base with criticism from opponents.Governor Noem's memoir reveals that she euthanized her dog, Cricket, due to aggressive behavior that included ruining a hunt and attacking local chickens. She described the dog as behaving like a ""trained assassin,"" posing a danger to people. Her candid recount of the incident has been met with dismay and horror, especially as she also admitted to killing a problematic goat in the same manner. This has led to significant backlash, with the Democratic National Committee and animal rights organizations like PETA condemning her actions as ""horrifying"" and ""disturbing.""Colleen O'Brien from PETA vehemently criticized Noem's handling of the situation, arguing that the dog could have been retrained or rehomed instead of being killed. This sentiment was echoed across social media and by public figures, who expressed horror and disbelief at Noem's actions, which they argue reflect a lack of compassion and judgment. Memes and comments comparing her to the fictional villain Cruella de Vil highlighted the public's shock and disapproval.The controversy also sparked political commentary, with Democratic governors using the incident to underscore ethical and value-based differences between the parties. They urged voters to consider empathy and ethical behavior as crucial traits in leaders.

The pre-action letter sent on Monday outlines his civil claim for damages for harassment abroad, physical injury, trespass to the person, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.“While in office, Shahzad highlighted army and ISI interference with his accountability and anti-corruption objectives. Believing that he could not fix the rampant corruption in Pakistan, he resigned from Khan’s government in Jan 2022,” a spokesperson for UK law firm Leigh Day, which is representing Akbar, said. On April 17, 2022, he fled to London.“He continues to campaign against corruption in Pakistan and remains highly critical of the military establishment and govt officials,” the spokesperson added.Akbar said: “Compared to what was done to me, I believe a lot worse is being inflicted on dissidents in Pakistan by the current regime. They are targeting political workers, lawyers, judges andjournalists. However, what should be most alarming is that Pakistan is able to target its dissidents on British soil without any accountability.”A spokesperson for Hertfordshire constabulary confirmed to TOI it was investigating the acid attack and was appealing for witnesses and to trace the motorbike the suspects rode. No arrests have been made.The Pakistan high commission in London said: “The govt rejects all such attempts to malign the reputation of its institutions for motivated agendas.”A spokesperson for the Pakistan ministry of foreign affairs said last Dec, when asked about the attack: “We reject any insinuations of Pakistan's involvement and that of Pakistani agencies in such a heinous attack. It is not our policy to target our own nationals abroad. We hope that culprits in this case will be identified and treated as per UK law.”","Shahzad Akbar (46), a Pakistani citizen who fled to Britain after Khan was ousted, was nearly blinded in the attack in front of his young child at their home in Royston, Hertfordshire.

It is not an admirable step because, at this serious juncture of our national life and the lowest point of our economic condition, we should be focusing on substantive issues rather than taking trivial and inconsequential decisions,"" The News quoted Mehboob as saying.Meanwhile, lawyer Abdul Moiz Jaferii highlighted the absence of any pretence of law or order in the notification regarding Dar's appointment on the said post.However, Supreme Court Advocate Basil Nabi Malik is of the view that Article 90(2) of the Constitution does allow the prime minister to act either directly or through his federal ministers.",The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) came down heavily against the Shehbaz Sarif- led government over the appointment of Ishaq Dar as Deputy PM.

Gen. Mao Phalla said the soldiers were transferring ammunition from trucks into a storage facility when the blast occurred, killing them instantly. He said another 11 people, including soldiers and nearby villagers, were slightly injured, mostly from debris from the damaged buildings, not shrapnel.Cambodia held a mass funeral on Sunday for those killed in the explosion.The initial but still not official theory was that the soldiers were unloading ammunition from a truck and stacking it on the ground before moving it into the storage facility, causing one item to explode, he said. That set off a chain reaction, added Mao Phalla.However, he said it will be difficult to determine the exact chain of events as all those involved in the unloading were killed.Mao Phalla said the site has been sealed off and that deminers from theCambodian Mines Action Center were clearing the area any unexploded ordnance.In March 2005, a nighttime blast at an arms depot in the northwestern provincial town of Battambang triggered an hourslong spray of shells and bullets that killed at least six people and caused panic.A 2014 report by the Swiss-based group Small Arms Survey highlighted the dangers of poorly stored or mishandled munitions, calling it a ""global problem.""

NEW DELHI: Meghan Markle will not accompany Prince Harry to the United Kingdom for the upcoming tenth anniversary celebration of the Invictus Games , a spokesman for the couple confirmed. The Duchess of Sussex will instead join Harry in Nigeria for an official visit immediately after his UK commitments. This sequence of events highlights the Duchess's ongoing commitment to their international engagements while underscoring her reduced presence in the UK following their move to California Since stepping back from royal duties and relocating to the United States , Meghan has rarely visited the UK, with sources previously citing her desire to avoid the associated ""drama."" Her decision to skip the significant event in London but confirm her presence in Nigeria reflects her and Harry's shifted focus towards global humanitarian and cultural efforts, a Daily Mail report said.Prince Harry's upcoming visit to the UK will be his first since losing a High Court appeal concerning his security arrangements. He is expected to stay in a hotel during his brief visit, which will include giving a reading at St. Paul’s Cathedral on May 8 to mark the Invictus Games' anniversary. Notably, no senior members of the Royal Family are slated to join him for this event.Following his UK visit, Prince Harry will meet Meghan in Nigeria for an ""Invictus-inspired"" trip, as per the couple’s spokesman. They are invited by Nigeria’s chief of defense staff, whom Harry met last September at the Invictus Games in Dusseldorf. The visit will include meeting service members and their families and engaging in traditional cultural activities.The trip to Nigeria holds personal significance for Meghan, who revealed in 2022 that she is 43 percent Nigerian. During a podcast, she expressed a desire to explore this part of her heritage further, which resonates particularly well with Nigerian women she has encountered.The choice to visit Nigeria, potentially aligning with the country's hopes to host a future Invictus Games, appears strategic. Royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams noted that while the trip acts as a ""face saver"" given Meghan's absence from the UK event, it also demonstrates savvy public relations maneuvering by the Sussexes.During Prince Harry's visit, King Charles III is expected to be engaged with other commitments, including his weekly meeting with the Prime Minister and attending the first Buckingham Palace garden party of the summer. The King's packed schedule coincides with his ongoing recovery from a recent cancer diagnosis, highlighting a period of intense public and private engagements for the British monarch.As Harry and Meghan continue to redefine their public roles from their base in the United States, their international visits are closely watched for indications of their future engagements and commitments to causes they support, both within and beyond the Invictus community.",Meghan Markle will not accompany Prince Harry to the upcoming tenth anniversary celebration of the Invictus Games.

People who looked like me were not in positions of political influence, let alone leading governments, when I was younger. For those who decry that multiculturalism has failed across the UK, I would suggest the evidence is to the contrary.” He made history 13 months ago when he became the first Muslim and first person of colour to hold the role.His father emigrated to UK from Pakistan ’s Punjab province and his mother is of Kenyan-Pakistani-Punjabi descent.As he spoke about the toll politics had taken on his family, he nearly broke into tears.Anas Sarwar, Pakistani-origin Scottish Labour leader , called for an election and said Labour’s no-confidence motion in the SNP government still stands.Yousaf saw SNP support plummet under his tenure. Most recently he faced widespread criticism for a hate crime act introduced this month which critics decried as a clampdown on free speech which led to the police being deluged with complaints about Yousaf himself in relation to a speech he made criticisingScotland for filling its senior positions with “white people”.The Scottish parliament has 28 days to nominate a replacement or else an election will be called.SNP MSP Kate Forbes, who was raised by Christian missionaries in India, is one of the names being put forward. The former finance secretary was taken out of her primary school in Glasgow and moved to Ludhiana, in Punjab, aged 10, where her father was involved in Bible teaching and managing the finances of a group of mission hospitals. She has spoken of the culture shock she experienced there sharing a classroom with 60 Indian children and getting slapped with a ruler for poor grades.She is a member of the Free Church of Scotland and faces some opposition within SNP ranks owing to her socially conservative views.",Humza Yousaf became the first Muslim and first person of colour to hold the role.
