The Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) said on Monday that a sewerage chamber has allegedly been constructed along the route of a primary stormwater drain opposite the police headquarters in Panaji.This construction is obstructing the flow of rainwater into the Mandovi, it said.A senior CCP official said that there are two drains that run parallel and are connected to the river outlet, adding that this particular chamber obstructs the flow of rainwater in one of the drains.The official said that the CCP has brought this to the notice of the PWD engineer concerned, and urged the department to undertake rectification work immediately.“The central part of Panaji recently witnessed major flooding, and this sewerage chamber blocking the flow of the rainwater could be one of the reasons,” he said.The CCP official claimed that sacks full of mud, which were dumped in the drains along a couple of road stretches during the sewerage work, were discovered and removed by the workers.But a senior PWD official said that the chamber is “partially towards the drain and not entirely”. “There is no major obstruction to the flow of water.

NEW DELHI: The International Criminal Court (ICC) is pursuing arrest warrants for Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , Israel's defense minister Yoav Gallant, and two other top Hamas leaders, Mohammed Diab Ibrahim al-Masri (also known as Mohammed Deif) and Ismail Haniyeh, according to a statement released by ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan on Monday.The charges are related to the October 7 attacks on Israel and the subsequent war in Gaza, which Khan alleges constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity .The charges against Sinwar, Haniyeh, and al-Masri include ""extermination, murder, taking of hostages, rape and sexual assault in detention"", while the charges against Netanyahu and Gallant include ""causing extermination, causing starvation as a method of war, including the denial of humanitarian relief supplies, deliberately targeting civilians in conflict,"" said Khan in his statement.The ICC's decision to target Netanyahu marks the first time the court has sought an arrest warrant for the top leader of a close US ally, placing him in the same category as Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is also facing an ICC arrest warrant over the war in Ukraine.A panel of ICC judges will now consider Khan's application for the arrest warrants.Israel's top leaders slammed the development as a ""historical disgrace"".A furious Netanyahu lashed out at the ICC and the prosecutor, stating that the ""absurd"" move was ""exactly what new anti-Semitism looks like"".Vowing to bring down Hamas and achieve total victory, Netanyahu said Israel was fighting a ""just war"".Israel's foreign minister Israel Katz also hit out at the ICC chief prosecutor, stating: ""The Attorney General in the same breath mentions the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence of the State of Israel alongside the abominable Nazi monsters of Hamas -- a historical disgrace that will be remembered forever.""Israeli war cabinet minister Benny Gantz slammed the move which he said draws ""parallels between the leaders of a democratic country determined to defend itself from despicable terror to leaders of a blood-thirsty terror organisation (Hamas)"". ""It is a deep distortion of justice and blatant moral bankruptcy,"" he added.Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri also panned the ICC prosecutor's move, stating that the decision ""equates the victim with the executioner"" and encourages Israel to continue its ""war of extermination"" in Gaza.Wasel Abu Youssef, member of the Palestine Liberation Organization executive committee, said: ""The Palestinian people have the right to defend themselves ... The ICC is required to issue arrest warrants against Israeli officials who are pursuing crimes of genocide in the Gaza Strip.""When reports of the potential ICC action surfaced last month, Netanyahu called it ""an outrage of historic proportions"" and asserted that Israel has an independent legal system that thoroughly investigates all violations of the law. In response to Netanyahu's comments, Khan stated, ""Nobody is above the law,"" and advised Israel to raise a challenge before the court's judges if they disagree with the ICC's jurisdiction.Although Israel and the US are not members of the ICC, the court claims jurisdiction over Gaza, East Jerusalem, and the West Bank after Palestinian leaders formally agreed to be bound by the court's founding principles in 2015.The US also slammed the ICC prosecutor's move, stating that such a ""shameful"" decision puts ""truce talks at risk"".""We reject the prosecutor's equivalence of Israel with Hamas ... The ICC arrest decisions could jeopardise efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement, hostage deal and to increase humanitarian aid in Gaza,"" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.","ICC pursuing arrest warrants for Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel's defense minister Yoav Gallant.

Coated head to toe in eye-catching gold paint, they stood perfectly still, leaning on glimmering canes and tipping their top hats open. Perhaps in a different place, the emergence of mimes on the street looking to earn a few dollars might go unnoticed.But this is Pakistan , where things under the security state often are not as simple as they seem. So as the number of golden performers grew, so, too, did the intrigue around them. Could they be informants for the nation's intelligence agency? Lookouts for powerful politicians? Maybe spies for CIA ?Today, the ""golden men"" of Islamabad have been added to the ranks of the conspiracy theories sprouted, knocked down and rehashed every day across the city.

Ahmed once sold umbrellas, but became ""Golden Thakur"" three years ago after he overheard another golden man saying he made up to Pak Rs 8,000 - or nearly $30 - each day. It was more than five times what Ahmed was taking home. That cash has dwindled recently as the novelty of the golden men has waned, he said. When asked if he would ever supplement his income with a little side work for the intelligence agencies, he immediately replied: ""no, no, no.""

Who is Ebrahim Raisi?

Won presidential poll in 2021

What Ebrahim Raisi’s rule mean for Iran and the world?

(With AP inputs)

NEW DELHI: A helicopter carrying Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi crashed in east Azerbaijan on Sunday.Iran has confirmed that the president was onboard the helicopter along with foreign minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian as well as two senior east Azerbaijan leaders.Rescuers are trying to reach the site of the ""incident"", state television reported. There was no immediate details on what happened to the chopper.Iran's hard-line President has long been seen as a protégé to Iran's supreme leader and a potential successor for his position within the country's Shiite theocracy.Reports of the ""hard landing"" of the chopper carrying Raisi have brought new attention to the leader, who already faces sanctions from the US and other nations over his involvement in the mass execution of prisoners in 1988.Ebrahim Raisi has served as a prosecutor for the majority of his career. In 2019, Iranian supreme leader Ali Khamenei named Raisi as chief justice. This appointment raised human rights concerns on account of his links to the mass execution of political prisoners in 1988 post the Iran-Iraq war.Amnesty International pointed out that the then-deputy prosecutor of Tehran served as a member of the “death commission”. Raisi has been identified as one of the four appointed judges responsible for the death sentences of 5,000 prisoners.On the contrary, the 60-year-old introduce himself as the best individual to battle corruption and tackle Iran’s financial issues.Raisi is viewed as a protégé of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and some analysts suggested that he could have replaced the 85-year-old leader after his death or resignation from the role.Raisi ran unsuccessfully for president in 2017 against Hassan Rouhani, the relatively moderate cleric who as president reached Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.In 2021, Raisi ran again in an election that saw all of his potentially prominent opponents barred for running under Iran's vetting system. He swept nearly 62% of the 28.9 million votes, the lowest turnout by percentage in the Islamic Republic's history. Millions stayed home and others voided ballots.Raisi has vowed to ease unemployment and work after lifting sanctions, especially on oil and shipping, imposed by America back in 2018. These sanctions are believed to have added to monetary hardship for Iranians.The 2015 nuclear deal with the P5 (five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany) offered Iran some relief from western sanctions on condition that the country will limit its nuclear production and activities. But in 2018, former US president Donald Trump stepped off the deal, which led to the re-imposition of sanctions on Iran’s trade business.The Middle Eastern country retaliated by resuming nuclear operations. Talks of restoring the nuclear deal are ongoing, with US president Joe Biden reluctant to lift sanctions.Raisi also supported attacking Israel in a massive assault in April that saw over 300 drones and missiles fired at the country in response for a suspected Israeli attack that killed Iranian generals at the country's embassy compound in Damascus, Syria - itself a widening of a yearslong shadow war between the two countries.The Iranian president also backed the country's security services as they cracked down on all dissent, including in the aftermath of the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini and the nationwide protests that followed.The months-long security crackdown killed more than 500 people and saw over 22,000 detained. In March, a United Nations investigative panel found that Iran was responsible for the ""physical violence"" that led to Amini's death after her arrest for not wearing a hijab, or headscarf, to the liking of authorities.","Ebrahim Raisi was on board the helicopter when it crashed in east Azerbaijan.

'It wasn't us': Israel on Iran President Raisi's chopper crash,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/could-israel-be-behind-the-crash-of-iranian-president-ebrahim-raisis-helicopter/articleshow/110261625.cms,"Israel's possible involvement?

NEW DELHI: Israel on Monday denied involvement in the death of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash that also killed several official of his entourage.""It wasn't us,"" news agency Reuters quoted an official, who requested anonymity.Ebrahim Raisi, the Iranian President known for his hard-line stance and close ties to the country's supreme leader, passed away at the age of 63.Raisi played a significant role in the mass executions of thousands in 1988 and later presided over Iran as it pursued uranium enrichment to near weapons-grade levels and carried out a substantial drone-and-missile attack on Israel.The unexpected demise of Raisi, along with Iran's foreign minister and other officials, occurred in a helicopter crash on Sunday in the northwestern region of Iran.The crash of Raisi's helicopter has sparked speculation and raised questions about the circumstances surrounding the incident. As Iran grapples with the loss of its president, a cloud of uncertainty looms over the nation, with implications that could reverberate across the Middle East.The death of President Raisi is likely to not only trigger a high-stakes power struggle within Iran but also have significant implications for the region. Amid a backdrop of escalating tensions and conflicts, the sudden absence of a key political figure like Raisi could disrupt the delicate balance of power within Iran and beyond.While the official explanation for the crash points to bad weather conditions, including rain and fog that hampered visibility during the flight, speculation has emerged regarding the possibility of foul play. Given Raisi's controversial tenure and the internal and external challenges facing Iran, questions have been raised about the potential involvement of domestic foes or even external actors like Israel.Given the historical animosity between Iran and Israel, some Iranians have speculated that Israel could be behind the crash, a report in the Economist said. This theory gains traction considering recent escalations, including Israel's assassination of an Iranian general in Damascus and Iran's subsequent missile barrage. The Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, is known for its operations against Iranian interests, though it has never targeted a head of state.Experts, however, find the theory of Israeli involvement unlikely. Assassinating a sitting president would be a direct act of war, likely provoking a severe response from Iran. Israel's strategic focus has traditionally been on military and nuclear targets rather than high-profile political assassinations. ""There are strong reasons to doubt Israel’s involvement. It has never gone so far as to assassinate a head of state, an unequivocal act of war that would invite a fierce Iranian response,"" the Economist report said.However, the helicopter crash's timing exacerbates regional tensions. Iran's network of proxies across Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and Yemen complicates the geopolitical landscape, particularly with the ongoing conflict involving Israel and Hamas. Any instability within Iran's leadership could embolden these groups, potentially leading to broader conflict.(With inputs from agencies)","Ebrahim Raisi, the Iranian President known for his hard-line stance and close ties to the country's supreme leader, passed away at the age of 63.

After Monday's hearing, two senior judges said Assange's argument that he might not be able to rely on the US First Amendment right to free speech deserved a full appeal, which is unlikely to be held for months.The news prompted cheering from supporters, holding placards ""Free, free Julian Assange!"". ""As a family we're relieved but how long can this go on?"" said Assange's wife Stella. ""The US should read the situation and drop this case now.""Assange himself was not present, which his lawyer said was for health reasons. The US justice department declined to comment on a pending judicial matter. Had Monday's ruling gone against him, Assange's team said he could have been on a plane to the US within 24 hours, ending over 13 years of legal battles in Britain.US prosecutors had told the court Assange could ""seek to rely"" upon the First Amendment protections granted to US citizens, and would not be discriminated against because of his nationality. But his legal team said a US court would not be bound by this. ""We say this is a blatantly inadequate assurance,"" lawyer Edward Fitzgerald told the judges. The HC also concluded that Assange's appeal should apply to all 18 counts, not only three, as lawyers for the US had argued. Fitzgerald did, however, accept a separate US assurance that Assange would not face the death penalty.","WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is given permission to appeal against extradition to the United States.

Biden calls ICC move on arrest warrants for Israeli leaders 'outrageous',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-calls-icc-move-on-arrest-warrants-for-israeli-leaders-outrageous/articleshow/110280736.cms,"NEW DELHI: Calling the International Criminal Court 's application for arrest warrants against Israeli leaders 'outrageous,' US President Joe Biden condemned the application and said that there is no equivalence between Israel and Hamas.ICC prosecutor requested arrest warrants for Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , Israel's defense minister Yoav Gallant, and two other top Hamas leaders, Mohammed Diab Ibrahim al-Masri (also known as Mohammed Deif) and Ismail Haniyeh.The charges are related to the October 7 attacks on Israel and the subsequent war in Gaza, which Khan alleges constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity.""The ICC prosecutor’s application for arrest warrants against Israeli leaders is outrageous. And let me be clear: whatever this prosecutor might imply, there is no equivalence — none — between Israel and Hamas. We will always stand with Israel against threats to its security,"" Biden said in a statement.US state secretary Antony Blinken also criticized the move, raising questions over the court's jurisdiction as well as its process in making this application. He added that it could jeopardize negotiations to achieve a hostage deal and a ceasefire.""Fundamentally, this decision does nothing to help, and could jeopardize, ongoing efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement that would get hostages out and surge humanitarian assistance in,"" Blinken said.The charges against Sinwar, Haniyeh, and al-Masri include ""extermination, murder, taking of hostages, rape and sexual assault in detention"", while the charges against Netanyahu and Gallant include ""causing extermination, causing starvation as a method of war, including the denial of humanitarian relief supplies, deliberately targeting civilians in conflict,"" said Khan in his statement.The ICC's decision to target Netanyahu marks the first time the court has sought an arrest warrant for the top leader of a close US ally, placing him in the same category as Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is also facing an ICC arrest warrant over the war in Ukraine.A panel of ICC judges will now consider Khan's application for the arrest warrants.Israel's top leaders slammed the development as a ""historical disgrace"".A furious Netanyahu lashed out at the ICC and the prosecutor, stating that the ""absurd"" move was ""exactly what new anti-Semitism looks like"".Vowing to bring down Hamas and achieve total victory, Netanyahu said Israel was fighting a ""just war"".Israel's foreign minister Israel Katz also hit out at the ICC chief prosecutor, stating: ""The Attorney General in the same breath mentions the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence of the State of Israel alongside the abominable Nazi monsters of Hamas -- a historical disgrace that will be remembered forever.""Israeli war cabinet minister Benny Gantz slammed the move which he said draws ""parallels between the leaders of a democratic country determined to defend itself from despicable terror to leaders of a blood-thirsty terror organisation (Hamas)"". ""It is a deep distortion of justice and blatant moral bankruptcy,"" he added.Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri also panned the ICC prosecutor's move, stating that the decision ""equates the victim with the executioner"" and encourages Israel to continue its ""war of extermination"" in Gaza.Wasel Abu Youssef, member of the Palestine Liberation Organization executive committee, said: ""The Palestinian people have the right to defend themselves ... The ICC is required to issue arrest warrants against Israeli officials who are pursuing crimes of genocide in the Gaza Strip.""When reports of the potential ICC action surfaced last month, Netanyahu called it ""an outrage of historic proportions"" and asserted that Israel has an independent legal system that thoroughly investigates all violations of the law. In response to Netanyahu's comments, Khan stated, ""Nobody is above the law,"" and advised Israel to raise a challenge before the court's judges if they disagree with the ICC's jurisdiction.Although Israel and the US are not members of the ICC, the court claims jurisdiction over Gaza, East Jerusalem, and the West Bank after Palestinian leaders formally agreed to be bound by the court's founding principles in 2015.","ICC prosecutor requested arrest warrants for Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and Israel's defense minister Yoav Gallant.

Sheer madness. To close the border and leave them there, that is madness. The migrant has to be received,"" the Pope said emphatically. He added, ""Thereafter you see how you are going to deal with him. Maybe you have to send him back, I don't know, but each case ought to be considered humanely.""Record numbers of migrants , largely from Central America and Venezuela, have been seeking to enter the United States, fleeing poverty, violence, and climate change-related disasters. The issue has become a pivotal topic in the upcoming November US election, with President Joe Biden's Republican challenger, former President Donald Trump, bringing it to the forefront of his campaign. Pope Francis lamented the ""globalization of indifference"" towards migrants, describing it as ""a very ugly disease.""The Pope also addressed the criticisms leveled at him by conservative US bishops who oppose his efforts to revisit certain teachings and traditions. ""A conservative is one who clings to something and does not want to see beyond that,"" he remarked, adding, ""It is a suicidal attitude."" Since his election in 2013, Pope Francis has emphasized the importance of a church open to all, including members of the LGBT community . However, he has faced strong resistance from conservative Catholics, especially following his decision to allow the blessing of gay couples last year, which met with particularly strong reactions in African countries. Calling gay people ""a human fact,"" Francis said, ""To bless each person, why not? The blessing is for all.""The pontiff also touched on the controversial issue of sexual abuse within the Catholic Church, reaffirming his commitment to a ""zero tolerance"" policy. ""Unfortunately, the tragedy of the abuses is enormous,"" he told CBS, emphasizing that abuse ""cannot be tolerated."" He added, ""When there is a case of a religious man or woman who abuses, the full force of the law falls upon them,"" but noted that ""there has been a great deal of progress.""Pope Francis' interview provided profound insights into his vision for a more just and compassionate world, emphasizing global unity, compassion towards migrants, and openness within the church.

The investigation found that Khan had illegally obtained and sold seven watches from the state gift repository during his time as the country's leader.The latest case involves accusations of keeping and selling ten high-value gifts without properly declaring them to the authorities or depositing them into the Toshakhana, as mandated by law.Regulations stipulate that any gifts received by the head of state, first lady, or president exceeding PKR 30,000 in value must be registered in the state gift repository, as reported by Geo News.The inquiry report also revealed that Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi , who was previously convicted in a Toshakhana case , received and kept a watch, a ring, and a necklace, which should have been submitted to the gift depository.The report further stated that the state gifts were acquired or retained at much lower prices, with discrepancies found in the valuation of luxury items by an inexperienced private appraiser who lacked the necessary expertise.One of the controversial items, a Graff watch set, was sold to Mohammad Shafiq for PKR 5,10,00,000 before its retention, with the entire retention cost of PKR 2,00,00,000 also being paid by Shafiq to the Protocol section staff, while the remaining amount was given to the assistant protocol section, according to the Geo News report. Subsequent assessments by various authorities indicated that the valuation of the retained gifts was significantly higher than initially appraised.Following these findings, NAB has been authorized to conduct further investigations against Khan and Bushra Bibi, who have both received separate call-up notices.

On May 9, the Islamia Girls School in Sheva town, North Waziristan, also suffered a bombing attack, although fortunately, no casualties were reported.The repeated targeting of educational institutions has instilled fear among the residents of the province, who have been witnessing such attacks for years. Reports indicate that the blast at the Sofia Noor School occurred around 3 am, causing damage to a portion of the building that was still under construction.While no casualties were reported, there have been claims on social media suggesting that the school's administration received extortion letters.

""His action is not linked to any larger mission.""Police have said the man's father was a known member of the Jemaah Islamiyah, a Southeast Asian terror network linked to al-Qaida, and that they found materials linked to the group in their home. Seven people including the man's parents and three siblings were detained and police were searching for some 20 Jemaah Islamiyah members in the state.The incident sparked concerns over a possible wider terror threat, prompting Singapore to issue a warning to its citizens to be vigilant when traveling to Johor.Police initially said the attacker was 34, but Saifudin said he was 21 years old, with no criminal record. He said the man did not interact much with his neighbors, and nor does his family. Investigations are ongoing to determine what the man's motive was, he added.Jemaah Islamiyah, designated a terror group by the U.S and banned in Indonesia, is widely blamed for attacks in the Philippines and Indonesia including the 2002 bombings in the Indonesian resort island of Bali that killed 202 people, mostly foreign tourists. The group has been considerably weakened by security crackdowns in the region.","Home Minister Saifuddin Nasution calls it a ""lone wolf attack,"" based on the initial investigation. The man stormed a police station in southern Johor state near Singapore in the early hours of Friday with a machete. He hacked a police constable to death and then used the dead officer's weapon to kill another. He injured a third officer before being shot dead.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110225096,imgsize-159002,width-400,resizemode-4/110225096.jpg"
WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange faces US extradition judgment day,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/wikileaks-founder-julian-assange-faces-us-extradition-judgment-day/articleshow/110247229.cms,"NEW DELHI: On Monday, a British court is expected to make a final ruling on whether Julian Assange , the founder of WikiLeaks , should be extradited to the United States for his role in the massive leak of classified US documents. This decision marks the culmination of a 13-year legal battle and various periods of detention for Assange.The two judges at the High Court in London will determine whether they are satisfied with the assurances provided by the US that Assange, aged 52, would not face the death penalty and could rely on the First Amendment right to free speech if he were to face a US trial for espionage.Assange's legal team believes that he could be on a plane to the US within 24 hours of the decision, released from jail, or that his case could be further delayed by months of additional legal proceedings.""I have the sense that anything could happen at this stage,"" his wife Stella said last week. ""Julian could be extradited, or he could be freed.""WikiLeaks published hundreds of thousands of classified US military documents related to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, which were considered the most significant security breaches in US military history.The organization also released a classified video in April 2010 depicting a 2007 US helicopter attack in Baghdad, Iraq, that resulted in the deaths of 12 people.The US authorities intend to prosecute Assange on 18 charges, primarily under the Espionage Act, alleging that his actions with WikiLeaks were reckless, compromised national security, and put the lives of agents at risk. Assange's supporters worldwide view the prosecution as an assault on journalism and free speech, as well as retaliation for causing embarrassment to the US government.Assange was first arrested in Britain in 2010 on a Swedish warrant over sex crime allegations that were later dropped. Since then he has been variously under house arrest, holed up in Ecuador's embassy in London for seven years, and held since 2019 in Belmarsh top security jail, latterly while he waited a ruling on his extradition.""Every day since the seventh of December 2010 he has been in one form of detention or another,"" said Stella Assange, who was originally part of his legal team and married him in Belmarsh in 2022.(With inputs from agencies)",A British court is expected to make a final ruling on whether Julian Assange should be extradited to the United States.

British Sikh peer faces year’s ban from House of Lords bars after harassing women while drunk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/british-sikh-peer-faces-years-ban-from-house-of-lords-bars-after-harassing-women-while-drunk/articleshow/110238442.cms,"LONDON: British Sikh peer Kulveer Ranger faces a year-long ban from all House of Lords bars and a three-week suspension from the House Lords after a committee found that he “bullied and harassed” two women in a parliamentary bar while drunk .Lord Ranger of Northwood (49), a London-born Sikh who was made a life peer in 2023, resigned the Tory whip after the House of Lords conduct committee, responsible for investigating breaches of conduct, recommended he be suspended from the House of Lords for three weeks and denied access to bars in the House of Lords for 12 months.The committee has invited the House of Commons to consider a similar ban on its bars.The House will now be asked to agree the report and sanctions, which follow an investigation by House of Lords Commissioner for Standards Martin Jelley. It found that Ranger approached a group of people in the House of Commons Strangers’ Bar on Jan 17, 2024 despite not knowing them. He was visibly drunk, stumbling around and asked the female members of the group how old they were and whether a publication they were discussing “had porn in it”.He approached the same group a short while later when two of the women asked him about his work prior to joining the House of Lords and what his interests were. Affronted, he said: “Why do you ask people these questions? You need to ask better questions.” He then shouted and swore at them, raising his voice and called them “useless” and to “do some research.”One of the women said he was physically intimidating, repeatedly jabbed his finger towards them and roughly grabbed their parliamentary passes to see where they worked. She said his behaviour felt like “an abuse of power”. “I think he was upset we didn’t know who he was. It was an ego thing,” she said.“Towards the end of our conversation, I was shaking,” the other woman said.The two women subsequently submitted a complaint about him.Ranger sent a written apology to both complainants saying it was out of character and he was dealing with family health issues at the time. He apologised to the conduct committee and expressed shock and remorse over his behaviour. He said he did not remember the incident but recalled drinking several glasses of wine.",British Sikh peer Kulveer Ranger faces a year-long ban from all House of Lords bars.

Charles is said to be angrier than anyone has ever seen him.""The UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office clarified that Harry and Meghan were visiting Nigeria in a private capacity and that the UK government was not involved in organizing their activities. Nonetheless, the visit had all the markings of a traditional royal tour, leading to perceptions of the couple acting as working royals.During their visit, Meghan co-hosted a Women in Leadership event with Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the director-general of the World Trade Organization.
