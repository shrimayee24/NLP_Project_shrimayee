In a significant escalation, Israeli fighter jets struck Houthi military targets near Yemen's Hodeidah port on Saturday, killing at least three people and wounding 87, a day after a drone launched by the Iranian-backed group hit Tel Aviv , Israel's economic hub.Most of the wounded suffered severe burns from the airstrikes that targeted oil facilities and a power station, according to Al-Masirah TV, the primary news outlet of Yemen's Houthi movement, which cited the health ministry.Hodeidah residents reported hearing explosions throughout the city during the intensive bombardment. Al-Masirah TV stated that civil defense forces and firefighters were attempting to extinguish fires in the port's oil tanks.The strikes, which triggered a raging fire and plumes of black smoke, are the first claimed by Israel in Yemen, marking a new phase in the conflict.The airstrikes targeted gas and oil depots and a power station in the Red Sea port of Hodeidah, which is controlled by the Houthis and contains vital oil export facilities. An Israeli military official, speaking on condition of anonymity, described the port as a significant supply route for Iranian weapons to Yemen. However, the port is also crucial for humanitarian aid to Yemen, and the official acknowledged that some ""dual-use"" targets, serving both military and civilian purposes, were struck.The Israeli military confirmed its warplanes targeted ""military objectives of the Huthi terrorist regime"" in response to the drone attack in Tel Aviv, which breached Israel's air defenses.Israeli ""fighter jets struck military targets of the Huthi terrorist regime in the area of Hodeida port in Yemen in response to the hundreds of attacks carried out against the state of Israel in recent months,"" the military said, as reported by AFP.Despite the attack, the Israeli military indicated it was not tightening emergency civil defense regulations, suggesting officials do not expect a more serious escalation, NYT reported.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that Israel will ""defend ourselves by all means"", hours after fighter jets struck a Huthi-controlled port in Yemen in retaliation for a deadly drone attack.""I have a message for Israel's enemies: Make no mistake. We will defend ourselves by all means, on all fronts. Anyone who harms us will pay a very heavy price for their aggression,"" he said in a televised address the day after a drone killed a civilian in Tel Aviv.Netanyahu also called on the international community to step up pressure on Tehran and its proxies - the Houthis, Hamas and Hezbollah - and in so doing help secure international trade routes.""Whoever wants to see a stable and safe Middle East needs to stand against Iran's axis of evil, and support Israel's struggle against Iran and its proxies,"" Netanyahu said.The Israeli bombardment caused a massive fire in the port area, likely from burning fuel.Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant declared the retaliatory action, saying, ""The blood of Israeli citizens has a price."" Gallant warned of more operations against the Iran-backed Huthis if further attacks occur.""The fire burning in Hodeidah is seen across the Middle East, and the significance is clear,"" said Gallant. ""The Houthis attacked us over 200 times. The first time that they harmed an Israeli citizen, we struck them — and we will do this in any place where it may be required,"" he added.Huthi official Mohammed Abdulsalam condemned the strikes, calling them a ""brutal Israel aggression against Yemen."" He claimed the attack targeted ""fuel storage facilities and a power plant"" to pressure Yemen to cease support for Palestinians in the Gaza conflict. The Huthi-run health ministry reported deaths and injuries but did not provide specific numbers.Al Masirah television, operated by the Huthis, aired footage of a massive blaze on the seafront, with a large plume of black smoke rising into the sky. AFP also reported several large explosions were heard and smoke was seen over the port.The drone attack on Tel Aviv on Friday, claimed by the Houthis, killed one Israeli and injured several others. This attack is part of a sustained Houthi campaign against Israel, involving hundreds of missiles and drones aimed at Israeli cities and commercial shipping in the Red Sea.Friday's deadly drone attack, which struck near a US diplomatic compound, breached Israel’s air defenses. Most previous Houthi-fired missiles and drones at Israel have been intercepted by US and Israeli forces.Until Saturday, Israel had refrained from a full-on attack against the Houthis in Yemen, located over 1,000 miles away. However, the Tel Aviv drone attack prompted a decisive response, with Israeli fighter jets flying toward Yemen by Saturday afternoon.The strikes have exacerbated fears about Yemen's already critical food security and humanitarian situation. Hodeida port, a crucial entry point for imports and international aid, has been a lifeline for millions of Yemenis suffering from over a decade of war.""This will likely be perceived by many Yemenis as an attack on their homeland, which could bolster Huthi recruitment and funding,"" said Mohammed Albasha, senior Middle East analyst for the US-based Navanti Group. He added that traders fear the strikes will worsen the humanitarian crisis in northern Yemen, as most trade flows through this port.The Biden administration had not immediately reacted to Saturday's strike. However, following Friday's attack in Tel Aviv, Gen Charles Q. Brown Jr., chair of the joint chiefs of staff, said at the Aspen Security Forum that ""Israel has the right to defend itself.""UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had called for ""maximum restraint"" after the Tel Aviv drone strike to avoid further regional escalation. However, Huthi politburo member Mohammed al-Bukhaiti quickly threatened revenge for the Hodeida strikes. ""The Zionist entity will pay the price for targeting civilian facilities, and we will meet escalation with escalation,"" he posted on social media.The Huthis have previously claimed attacks on Israeli cities, including Ashdod, Haifa, and Eilat, but Friday's strike on Tel Aviv was the first to breach Israel's vaunted air defenses.","Israeli fighter jets strike Houthi military targets near Yemen's Hodeidah port, killing at least three people and wounding 87.

CHENNAI: IIT-Madras student Dhananjay Balakrishnan , who received governor’s prize at the institute’s 61st convocation on Friday, spoke out against the ongoing ‘ mass genocide ’ in Palestine and said there is no end in sight.Dhananjay won the prize for best all-round proficiency in curricular and extracurricular activities in a dual degree in mechanical engineering.In his acceptance speech, Dhananjay said, “I feel like I would be doing myself, and everything I believe in, a great injustice if I do not use the stage I am presented with to say something important. This is a call for action. There is a mass genocide going on in Palestine. People are dying in vast numbers, and there is no end in sight.”He said, “Why should we be bothered about this, you ask. Because STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) as a field itself has historically been used to advance the ulterior motives of imperial powers, such as Israel.”Talking about the role of tech giants in the war, he said, “As engineering students, we work hard to get top-level jobs at tech giants, which offer very lucrative jobs with great benefits. However, these tech giants control various aspects of our lives today, as you know better than anyone. Many of these prestigious companies are also directly and indirectly implicated in the war against Palestine, by providing the state of Israel with technology—technology used to kill.”Dhananjay said he also didn’t have all the answers.“There are no easy solutions, and I don’t have all the answers. But I do know this—as engineers graduating into the real world, it is our job to be aware of the consequences of the work we do. And also, (it is our job) to interrogate our own position in these complex systems of power imbalances.”“I hope that we can incorporate this awareness more into our daily lives, attempting to understand what we can do to liberate the oppressed, on lines of caste, class, creed, and gender. That is the first step to put an end to the never-ending cycle of suffering,” he added.He urged his fellow students to work to lift people out of misery.“Isaac Newton said that he stood on the shoulders of giants to take him where he wanted to go. I want to say this - I am here, we are here by standing on the magnanimous shoulders of the great Indian populace. We owe it to them to lift every single person out of their misery. Inaction is complicity. I hope you and I and all of us can take action to make the right decisions—however hard they may be,” he said.At the convocation, 2,636 students, including 444 scholars, were awarded degrees.Nobel laureate Brian Kobilka handed over prizes and medals in the convocation.",Dhananjay won the prize for best all-round proficiency in curricular and extracurricular activities in a dual degree in mechanical engineering.

Switzerland Euthanasia: Death to cost $20 as Switzerland plans first 'suicide pod',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/mad-mad-world/death-to-cost-20-as-switzerland-plans-first-suicide-pod/articleshow/111844031.cms,"The Sarco , a 3D-printed portable suicide pod , will soon be utilised in Switzerland for the first time, according to an assisted dying organization .This futuristic capsule, which was initially introduced in 2019 amidst controversy, enables a person to end their life without medical supervision, reported Independent.The pod's chamber is filled with nitrogen, rapidly decreasing oxygen levels once a button is pressed from the inside, resulting in the individual losing consciousness and passing away within about 10 minutes.Switzerland has permitted assisted suicide since the 1940s, provided that the person assisting has no direct interest in the death. This has led to the country being referred to as a ""death tourism"" destination by some, as reported by Reuters.Florian Willet from The Last Resort, a newly established organisation that provides assisted dying services to individuals with ""serious physical illness,"" announced during a press conference on Tuesday that the first use of Sarco will occur in the near future.However, the specific details regarding the time, date, and location of the first assisted suicide using the Sarco pod have not been determined. The identity of the first user also remains undisclosed.Fiona Stewart, a lawyer on The Last Resort's advisory board, emphasised that such information would only be released after the event has taken place, stating, ""we really don't want a person's desire for a peaceful passing Switzerland to turn into a media circus."" She confirmed that the pod's inaugural use would occur within this year.Such details would not be made public until after the event because ""we really don't want a person's desire for a peaceful passing Switzerland to turn into a media circus"", Stewart told AFP.Asked if the first use would be this year, she replied: ""I would say yes"".She said the only cost for the user would be 18 Swiss francs ($20) for the nitrogen.The device has faced calls for a ban with opponents of it referring to Article 115 of the Swiss Criminal Code which says that assisting suicide is a crime if done for ""selfish"" reasons.""Whoever, from selfish motives, induces another person to commit suicide or aids him in it, shall be confined in the penitentiary for not over five years, or in the prison, provided that the suicide has either been completed or attempted,"" the code says.The pod was invented by Philip Nitschke, 76, the founder of Exit International.

Donald Trump Height: How tall is Donald Trump? Why does height matter in US politics?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-tall-is-donald-trump-why-does-height-matter-in-us-politics/articleshow/111907348.cms,"Donald Trump 's height has been a subject of public intrigue and debate for years. Officially listed as 6'3"", his stature has often been part of his larger-than-life persona. However, recent developments have sparked renewed scrutiny and scepticism about the accuracy of this claim. Also read: How tall are Trump family members? Donald Trump’s height has consistently been reported as 6'3"" during his public appearances and medical assessments.This height has been a part of his public image, contributing to his imposing presence. During his presidency, White House physician Dr. Ronny Jackson listed Trump at 6'3"" in his official health records, a measurement that was largely accepted by the public and the media at the time.The controversy was reignited during Trump's legal issues in 2023 and 2024. When he was booked in Fulton County, Georgia, his height was recorded as 6'3"", but his weight was listed at 215 pounds, significantly lower than previous reports. This discrepancy drew widespread scepticism and mockery, with many doubting the accuracy of the reported figures.In previous instances, such as during his first criminal indictment in April 2023, Trump’s weight was reported to be around 240 pounds. This sudden drop of 25 pounds within a few months seemed implausible to many observers, leading to speculation that the figures might have been self-reported rather than measured.The media and public reacted swiftly to these reports. On social media platforms like X, many users compared Trump's reported height and weight to those of professional athletes, pointing out the implausibility. For example, several commentators noted that Trump's listed dimensions were nearly identical to those of NFL quarterback Lamar Jackson, sparking further doubt.Television hosts and news anchors also chimed in. CNN anchor Jake Tapper expressed disbelief on air, while MSNBC host Rachel Maddow questioned whether the measurements were actually taken or simply reported by Trump himself. This wave of scepticism was echoed across various media outlets, further fueling the controversy.Height has historically played a role in politics, often influencing public perception of a leader’s strength and authority. Taller candidates are frequently perceived as more commanding and capable, a factor that can subtly influence voter opinions. In Trump’s case, his height has been a part of his brash and bold image, reinforcing his persona as a powerful and assertive leader.The confusion and debate over Trump's height and weight highlight broader issues about transparency and truthfulness in public figures. It underscores the importance of accurate and honest reporting of personal details, especially for individuals in positions of power and influence. Moreover, it reflects the ongoing scrutiny that public figures face regarding their personal health and fitness, which can impact their credibility and public trust.Initial Google search results inaccurately listed Vance's height as 5'7"", which seemed incorrect given his stature compared to his Senate colleagues. To clarify, a campaign official released a photo of Vance standing next to former President Trump, who is listed as 6'3"" by his White House physician. Vance is almost as tall as Trump and is at least 6'2"".Barron Trump, the youngest son of former President Donald Trump, has recently garnered attention for his remarkable height. Photographed at his maternal grandmother’s funeral, the now 17-year-old's stature was striking, highlighting just how much he has grown. For those who haven't been following Barron closely, this recent appearance might come as a surprise, prompting comments like, “Man, that kid shot up like a weed!”So, how tall is he exactly? Barron Trump's exact height is a topic of some debate, even within his own family. Donald Trump has mentioned different figures, claiming at various times that Barron is either 6'7"" or 6'8"". This variation might be due to differences in measurement methods or Donald Trump's history of exaggerating his own height. Regardless, Barron is exceptionally tall.","Donald Trump’s height has consistently been reported as 6'3"" during his public appearances and medical assessments.

He mocked Democrats and compared former Democratic house speaker Nancy Pelosi to a ""dog,"" while also attacking President Joe Biden and repeating false claims about various issues.Here are five key takeaways from his speech in rally:The recently held Republican National Convention saw Trump downplaying false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him.However, during his return to the campaign trail on Sunday night, Trump did not hold back.""The Radical Left Democrats rigged the presidential election in 2020 and we're not going to allow them to rig the presidential election in 2024,"" he declared, making another reference to voter fraud .""We want a landslide that is too big to rig,"" he added later.Trump urged early voters to ""follow your vote"" and claimed that in 2020, some states were ""shoveling ballots into wheelbarrows, moving them around.""The crowd cheered as he called on them to ""Fight, fight, fight.""Trump reiterated his disapproval of Project 2025 , a manifesto opponents describe as an authoritarian, right-wing agenda.""The other side is going around trying to make me sound extreme ... I'm not an extremist at all,"" he complained.He described the Heritage Foundation 's blueprint to reshape the federal government as the work of ""the radical right... they're seriously extreme,"" claiming, ""I don't know what the hell it is.""Trump said that the notion of him being a ""threat to democracy"" is ""misinformation.""""Last week, I took a bullet for democracy,"" he said.Trump criticized Biden's candidacy, highlighting concerns within the Democratic Party about Biden's age, as some believe that at 81, he is too old to serve another term.""They have no idea who their candidate is ...

Yorkshire police assured complete investigation



Reactions from Officials



Major riots broke out in Leeds, UK, with protesters overturning police vehicle and setting double-decker bus on fire.West Yorkshire Police reported that they were dispatched to Luxor Street, Harehills , at 5 pm on Thursday in response to an ongoing incident. Upon arrival, officers ""found an ongoing disturbance which involved some agency workers and some children.""As a crowd began to gather, the officers decided to relocate the agency workers and children to a safer location.However, the situation escalated, and ""pockets of disorder"" emerged in the area.Social media posts allegedly showed a sizable crowd gathered on the street, with a police car being overturned and a bus being set on fire.Reports suggest that the riots were triggered by a protest following the removal of four children from a family by social services. One of the children had been taken to the hospital for treatment of an injury inflicted by a sibling. Local media reports indicate that the hospital authorities informed social services about the incident, leading to the children being removed from the family, which in turn sparked the protests.Police arrived to find an ongoing disturbance. By 9 pm, no uniformed officers were visible at the main disturbance site, although a police helicopter monitored the situation from above. Yorkshire police promised a thorough investigation into all criminal activities, including property damage caused by fires, and emphasised their commitment to holding those responsible accountable. ""We want to emphasise that those responsible will face the full consequences of the law,"" said the police.Tom Riordan, chief executive of the Leeds City Council, said calm was restored by about 1 am and authorities have already begun to clean up the damage.“There was a family incident earlier in the day that the police attended and our officials attended that a lot of the community got concerned about,” Riordan said in an interview with the BBC. “And that appeared to be the trigger of concern for groups of people being concerned about what had happened.”Mayor of West Yorkshire, Tracy Brabin, expressed gratitude to emergency services in a social media post and urged those escalating tensions to reconsider their actions. She noted that no serious injuries had been reported. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper condemned the violence, stating that such disorder has no place in society. Councillor Salma Arif of Gipton and Harehills urged residents to remain indoors in a video statement, confirming that police were managing the situation. ""There is an ongoing situation currently in Harehills, we’re aware of that so police are here. We are asking everybody in the area to please stay at home at this moment in time,"" she said.","Major riots broke out in Leeds, UK, with protesters overturning police vehicle and setting double-decker bus on fire.

Joe Biden drops out of US presidential race: What happens next,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/joe-biden-drops-out-of-us-presidential-race-what-happens-next/articleshow/111914606.cms,"How is the process going to work?

The Democratic National Committee (DNC) had been preparing to hold a virtual roll call vote to officially pick the nominee, starting as early as the middle of next week. However, these plans are now in flux following President Biden’s decision to step aside. DNC Chair Jaime Harrison promised the party “will undertake a transparent and orderly process” to select the nominee, but specific details remain unclear. A DNC spokesperson did not immediately respond to questions about whether the process will include a virtual roll call before the convention or occur on the convention floor in Chicago during the week of August 19.

Will anyone challenge Kamala Harris?

While Biden’s endorsement of Kamala Harris might deter significant opposition, there are still potential challengers. Governors like Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Andy Beshear of Kentucky, and JB Pritzker of Illinois could consider running. Of these, all but Newsom might see a better political future in vying to be Harris’ running mate rather than mounting an insurgent campaign for the nomination.

Will the rest of the party get in line?

Not necessarily. Even if most potential challengers decide not to run, there is no guarantee of unanimous support for Harris. Some Democrats, including elected officials and major donors, have expressed concerns about Harris’ low favorability ratings. Former President Barack Obama ’s statement following Biden’s announcement did not include a Harris endorsement but instead expressed confidence in the party's ability to create a fair process. Harris acknowledged the need to “earn and win” the nomination, suggesting that competition, not a coronation, might be more beneficial.

So, would anyone be a stronger candidate?

It is currently unclear if anyone would be a stronger candidate. Polls have only recently started asking voters about a Harris-Trump matchup, and there is little data on other potential Democratic candidates. Surveys conducted before the GOP convention and the failed attempt on Trump ’s life showed minimal differences in voter support between various Democratic candidates.

What's next for Democrats

and delegates to replace Biden on the ticket?

The Democratic National Convention is scheduled for August 19-22 in Chicago. Biden’s endorsement of Harris places her in a favorable position, but it’s not guaranteed. Biden did not resign from the presidency, which would have made Harris the incumbent president.

According to political consultant Josh Putnam, “We’re just in uncharted territory here and a lot of this stuff hasn’t been tested, certainly not in the modern era of presidential nomination.” Delegates, previously pledged to Biden, are now free to support any candidate. There are informal ways of nudging them toward Harris, including Biden’s endorsement, but no formal rule-based structure transfers delegates directly from one candidate to another ahead of the convention.

How can Democrats pick a new candidate step by step?

Once Biden dropped out of the race, his delegates became free agents. The DNC could hold a virtual vote to lock in a new nominee before the convention. If no majority is reached, the decision would be made at an open convention, a scenario not seen since 1968. To appear on the ballot, a candidate needs signatures from at least 300 delegates. If a consensus is not reached before the convention, delegates will vote in successive rounds until a candidate secures a majority. This could potentially turn into a brokered convention, where superdelegates can vote starting from the second ballot.

What would an open convention look like?

An open convention happens when no candidate arrives with a clear majority of delegates. Candidates would need signatures from at least 300 delegates to enter the race. The first ballot involves pledged delegates voting. If no majority is achieved, superdelegates join the voting pool from the second ballot onward. Voting continues until a candidate wins the majority of delegate votes. This could lead to extensive behind-the-scenes dealmaking and maneuvering, potentially making the convention a dramatic and unpredictable event.

What roles might Members of Congress play at the national nominating conventions?

Members of Congress often participate in national nominating conventions as delegates. For Democrats, these are known as party leader and elected official (PLEO) delegates or superdelegates. They include the party’s Members of Congress, President, Vice President, Governors, and other top officials. These delegates are not pledged to any candidate and only vote on the second ballot if no nominee is selected on the first ballot.

How has the Democratic nominating calendar changed for 2024?

The Democratic Party significantly altered its nominating calendar for 2024. Notably, the party decided to start the nominating season with the South Carolina primary on February 3, followed by Nevada and Michigan, instead of the traditional Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary. This change followed extensive debate within the party about whether Iowa and New Hampshire adequately represented national demographics and produced the most competitive candidates.

Can Barack Obama run for President again?

The simple answer is no. The 22nd Amendment to the US Constitution, ratified in 1951, explicitly states that no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice. This amendment was passed in response to Franklin D Roosevelt's four terms in office, ensuring that no future president could hold power for such an extended period.

Instead, there was relief that the situation had concluded, alongside disappointment towards Biden’s senior aides for not advising him against running this year.“There’s a lot of frustration at the senior staff who put him in this situation [and] enabled him to not have a dignified exit [from the campaign] 9 months ago,” the report quoted a source as saying.","The president's staffers, who were caught off guard and did not see this coming, said they learned of the President's decision through the announcement made on social media.

US President Joe Biden announced on Sunday that he is withdrawing from the 2024 presidential race and has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as his successor. This decision, coming after intense criticism and pressure from his own party, has led to varied reactions from both Democrats and Republicans .Former President Barack Obama congratulated his former vice president of eight years.“Joe Biden has been one of America’s most consequential presidents, as well as a dear friend and partner to me. Today, we’ve also been reminded — again — that he’s a patriot of the highest order,” Obama said.Democratic lawmakers have largely praised Biden’s decision, hailing it as a selfless act prioritising the country's and party's interests over personal ambition. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer praised Biden, saying, “Joe Biden has not only been a great president and a great legislative leader but he is a truly amazing human being. His decision of course was not easy, but he once again put his country, his party, and our future first.”“We’re all finding out by tweet,” one Democrat close to the matter told Politico. “None of us understand what’s happening.”“I don’t think a soul in Delaware knew,” a Biden state official told the outlet of campaign staffers’ apparent surprise at the suddenness of the news.Despite this positive reception, the announcement has stirred debate among Democrats about the path forward. Many had urged Biden to step aside after a poor debate performance and growing concerns about his ability to win the . Nearly three dozen lawmakers publicly called for him to end his re-election bid, with others expressing private concerns about the potential impact on down-ballot Democrats. Biden's withdrawal is seen by some as a move to safeguard the party’s prospects.In a post on his Truth social media platform, Republican leader Trump attacked Biden, stating: ""Crooked Joe Biden was not fit to run for President, and is certainly not fit to serve - And never was! He only attained the position of President by lies, fake News, and not leaving his Basement.In stark contrast, Republicans have seized upon Biden’s decision to press for his resignation from office. They argue that if Biden is deemed unfit to run for another term, he should also step down from the presidency. House Speaker Mike Johnson asserted, “If Joe Biden is not fit to run for President, he is not fit to serve as President. He must resign the office immediately. November 5 cannot arrive soon enough.” Similarly, Rep. Tom Emmer tweeted, “If the Democratic party has deemed Joe Biden unfit to run for reelection, he’s certainly unfit to control our nuclear codes. Biden must step down from office immediately.”The political landscape is now shifting as Biden steps aside. While many Democrats are still grappling with the implications of his withdrawal, the focus remains on how the party will handle the upcoming election without its current leader.","US President Joe Biden announced on Sunday that he is withdrawing from the 2024 presidential race and has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as his successor.

Local witnesses said the shots fired during the rally forced protesters to disperse. “Direct firing on peaceful protesters is state terrorism. The people of Bannu will continue their peaceful resistance with unity and consensus for peace,” said former senator Mushtaq Ahmed.Led by young activist Manzoor Pashteen, PTM is known for its strident criticism of Pakistan’s powerful military for its role in alleged enforced disappearances, extrajudicial killings of rights activists and ethnic leaders, as well as the alleged mistreatment of the Pakhtun community by security forces.Pashteen posted on X that the Pakistani army had opened fire on what he described as a “peaceful protest.” The demonstration came in the wake of a militant attack on a military base in the area on July 15 in which eight soldiers were killed.Islamabad has repeatedly raised concerns about cross-border attacks with the Taliban administration in Afghanistan, exacerbating tensions between the two countries. Security forces from both nations have clashed at the border in recent years.The protest underscores growing frustration and fear among residents in this remote region which has been a hotspot of militant activity.","Pakistan Army opened fire on hundreds of people gathered in the northwestern city of Bannu on Friday.
