NEW DELHI: In fast widening hostilities, India hit several air defence systems and other targets in Pakistan after thwarting missiles and drones launched from across the border against Indian military bases and civilian areas in the early hours of Thursday as well as later at night.

Pakistan army chief Asim Munir will not be given a face-saving exit,"" a senior officer told TOI, as India's counter-strikes were still unfolding at night, including forward deployment of warships in northern Arabian Sea and total breakdown of the LoC ceasefire.Amid the 'fog of war', there were unconfirmed reports of two Pakistani JF-17 jets and an F-16 fighter being shot down and India targeting Pak capital Islamabad.The IAF deployed Israeli-origin Harop and Harpy kamikaze drones, which act as cruise missiles by exploding into enemy targets and radars, soon after Pakistan launched a salvo of missiles and suicide drones at 15 Indian military targets in northern and western India around 1am.The drone and missile attacks by Pakistan resumed as it got dark, with multiple locations being targeted, including Jaisalmer air base, Amritsar and military stations of Jammu, Pathankot and Udhampur as well as other places like Samba and Arnia. Explosions caused panic in Jammu city as the heavily-guarded airport was one of the targets. ""The threats were neutralised by our armed forces through kinetic and non-kinetic (jamming) actions.

NEW DELHI: The presence of senior Pakistan army officers at the funeral of one of those killed in India's surgical strike on Jaish-e-Muhammed's terror camp at Bahawalpur sparked speculation about Abdul Rauf Asghar - the younger brother of Jaish chief Masood Azhar and mastermind of the IC814 hijack , Pathankot fidayeen strike and the Pulwama attack that killed 40 CRPF personnel - being among those killed.Foreign secretary Vikram Misri, at the official govt briefing on Thursday, refused to comment on the speculation about Rauf's death, but sources in security agencies said the funeral attendance was seen as a possible giveaway.Rauf, around 48 years old, was the most senior Jaish figure residing in the Markaz Subhan Allah at Bahawalpur. Rauf is believed to be the de facto head of Jaish, managing all its operations, overseeing training of its top fidayeen and plotting terror attacks against India.On X, BJP said Rauf had been ""eliminated"" while recalling his role as the prime conspirator and mastermind behind the Kandahar hijack, executed by him to secure the release of his brother Masood, the Pathankot attack and the 2001 Parliament terror strike.Masood chose the targets but stayed away from the finer planning, leaving such details to his younger brother.

Evacuations, officials told TOI, have since been stepped up not only in Poonch but also other border villages spread across Uri, Baramulla, Karnah, Tangdhar, Mendhar and Rajouri in J&K, all of which came under shelling on Tuesday and Wednesday night.Pakistan army had resorted to heavy mortar fire and shelling at several points in J&K close to LoC/international border soon after Indian armed forces struck terror facilities across PoK and Pakistan during the intervening night of May 6 and 7.Though Poonch town - which is just 2-3 km from the LoC, as is Rawalakot in PoK - has traditionally never been targeted with shelling, this time was an exception.The Pakistani forces opened heavy mortar fire, hitting civilian targets in the main Poonch town. This caused more than a dozen casualties, essentially border residents that were yet to be moved to bunkers of safer places inside. Local hospitals reported many more as injured.At its briefing here on Thursday, the ministry of external affairs put the overall toll of civilians killed in shelling from Pakistan, at 16, and the injured at 59.TOI has learnt that though the evacuation plans were drawn up in advance, with community bunkers readied across several border villages and schools and other buildings in areas further from the border earmarked to accommodate displaced border residents, the deployment of additional troops and equipment at LoC in anticipation of an escalation by Pakistan had been going on for the last few days.Civilian population was yet to be fully evacuated when Pakistani forces struck with mortar fire and shelling at several points along the LoC/IB. The Indian forces - Army and BSF - responded to the provocation with heavy retaliatory fire.Over the past couple of days, the J&K administration has ensured the evacuation of a large number of border residents, relocating them in community bunkers or government buildings like schools and halls, till the border is safer.""The local authorities in the border districts are connected 24x7 to the integrated control room to coordinate evacuation, emergency response, blackouts, medical assistance and maintenance of essential supplies and services,"" a senior J&K government official told TOI.","Pakistani forces opened heavy mortar fire, hitting civilian targets in the main Poonch town.

He said it's all been at the behest of the West, of the US and UK, but they're hardly likely to corroborate him.Then, Bilawal Bhutto admitted on Sky News, ""I don't think it's a secret Pakistan has a past as far as extremist groups are concerned.""

Asked if he had concrete evidence, he was left tongue-tied. The interviewer tried to put him on the mat on whether Pakistan had used Chinese equipment to counter the Indian strikes. He refused to answer. Clearly, it's okay for Pak mantris to diss their country but not China. That too tells you something.Amid the numerous gaffes by its ministers, Pakistan also dismissed India's statement that it had launched drone and missile strikes on 15 Indian military sites, including Amritsar, Srinagar, and Chandigarh, branding them as ""cinematic fabrications"" aimed at deflecting domestic scrutiny.

The incident occurred around 11pm on 8 May, with BSF units acting swiftly to prevent the incursion. In a post on X, BSF Jammu confirmed, “At around 2300 hours on 8 May 2025, BSF foiled a major infiltration bid at the International Boundary in Samba district, J&K.”This development comes amid a wider escalation of hostilities following India’s recent military actions under ‘Operation Sindoor’.The operation, launched on 7 May, targeted nine terror camps across Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir. These camps were reportedly linked to terror groups including Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed. The strikes were said to be in direct retaliation for the 22 April terrorist attack in Pahalgam, which killed 28 civilians.Defence sources have indicated that the Indian Army also brought down two Pakistani drones in the Naushera sector, during intense artillery exchanges along the Line of Control. Meanwhile, unconfirmed reports emerged of a Pakistani Air Force jet being shot down in Punjab’s Pathankot sector, though official verification is awaited.Pakistan reportedly attempted to hit military targets in Jammu, Pathankot, and Udhampur using drones and missiles. The Integrated Defence Staff said these threats were “neutralised using kinetic and non-kinetic means” and confirmed that there were no casualties.

Pahalgam was original escalation: Foreign secretary Vikram Misri,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pahalgam-was-original-escalation-foreign-secretary-vikram-misri/articleshow/121011385.cms,"NEW DELHI: Debunking Pakistan's claim that India had targeted the Neelum-Jhelum hydropower project in POK in the May 7 military strikes on terrorist camps and infrastructure, the govt warned Pakistan of serious consequences if it used that ""blatant lie"" as a pretext for launching an attack on any infrastructure project in India. Foreign secretary Vikram Misri also said it was Pakistan that was responsible for the original escalation in the form of the Pahalgam attack and the choice of de-escalation too was with Pakistan.With Pakistan looking to inject a communal element into India's actions, Misri hit back by linking the Pahalgam attack with Pakistan army chief Asim Munir's April 16 speech in which he had stressed the two-nation theory and ""stark differences between Hindus and Muslims"".""You are aware of the kind of religious profiling that was done there (Pahalgam) and perhaps there is a linkage between these two events. I think that (speech) is the last word in communal rhetoric,"" he said.Accusing India of attacking the Neelum-Jhelum project, Pakistan's defence minister Khwaja Asif had said ""this is not something we will sweep under the rug"". When such a line was crossed, he had said, a response became inevitable.Misri strongly denied Pakistan's claim, describing it as an absolute fabrication and a blatant lie. ""India has targeted only and only terrorist infrastructure, and details of that terrorist infrastructure, together with the locations, were shared yesterday,"" he said.""I should note that if this kind of a claim is a pretext for targeting Indian infrastructure of a similar nature, Pakistan will be entirely responsible for the consequences that will undoubtedly follow,"" he said.Briefing journalists about developments on the second day of Operation Sindoor , Misri said Pakistan had unleashed a disinformation war against India with its claims Indian govt was responsible for the current escalation and there were no terrorists in Pakistan.""There are several terrorist attacks around the world where Pakistani fingerprints have been found. I don't need to belabour the point about where Osama bin Laden was found and who called him a martyr,"" Misri said, adding that Pakistan has for decades pursued cross-border terrorism into India with impunity. He said India would provide more information soon to the UN 1267 Sanctions Committee about UN-proscribed terror group LeT's links with TRF.On Pakistan's claim only civilians were killed in India's May 7 strikes, Misri displayed a photograph showing senior Pakistan army officers at a funeral and wondered why it was being carried out with coffins draped in Pakistani flags and state honours being accorded. ""As far as we are concerned, the individuals eliminated at these facilities were terrorists. Giving terrorists state funerals may be a practice in Pakistan, but it doesn't seem to make much sense to us,"" he said.On Pakistan's claim that several Indian jets had been downed during the op, Misri said India will share information at an appropriate time. ""Pakistan has been lying since it was born in 1947,"" he said.While Pakistan has accused India of deliberately targeting mosques, Misi said it was Islamabad that was misusing religious sites as a cover to radicalise, direct, indoctrinate and train terrorists. He added it was Pakistan which attacked a gurdwara in Poonch in firing across the LoC, and killed three members of the Sikh community.Addressing what he described as Pakistan's disinformation on the Indus Waters Treaty, Misri accused Islamabad of acting in violation of the treaty, deliberately creating legal roadblocks in India exercising its legitimate rights on the western rivers. ""Any projects that India sought to build on the eastern rivers, and even on the western rivers, which we are allowed to by the treaty, were always challenged by Pakistan, thereby hampering our rights to utilise our legitimate waters under the treaty,"" he said, adding that Pakistan's persistent refusal to respond to India's request for a modification of the treaty was itself a violation of the treaty.","India warns Pakistan of serious consequences if it used ""blatant lie"" as a pretext for launching an attack on any infrastructure project in India.

First Lady Melania Trump is hosting an event in the White House to unveil a postage stamp honoring former first lady Barbara Bush .

How Operation Sindoor brought justice for beheaded American journalist Daniel Pearl,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-operation-sindoor-brought-justice-for-beheaded-american-journalist-daniel-pearl/articleshow/120998633.cms,"



India’s precision military action ' Operation Sindoor ', launched in response to the barbaric Pahalgam terror attack, has also achieved an unexpected but much-awaited outcome: bringing long-overdue justice to the family of slain American journalist Daniel Pearl , whose brutal murder in Pakistan shocked the world in 2002.One of the nine terror infrastructure targets destroyed in the early hours of May 7 included a facility in Bahawalpur, long known as the stronghold of the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), the terrorist organisation led by Masood Azhar. The group is responsible for several terror attacks in India, including the 2001 Parliament attack and the 2019 Pulwama suicide bombing.Daniel Pearl, the South Asia bureau chief for The Wall Street Journal , was abducted in Karachi while investigating terror links in Pakistan’s intelligence establishment.A month later, a chilling video emerged showing his beheading. Despite global outrage, accountability remained elusive, as those involved continued to operate freely under the protection of various terror outfits and their Pakistani patrons.Bharatiya Janata Party and several reports also claimed that most wanted Abdul Rauf Azhar, brother of Masood Azhar was also killed in the strike.Azhar’s role in the IC-814 hijacking had led to release of Omar Saeed Sheikh, who later kidnapped and killed Daniel Pearl.Pearl’s collegue and Indian-American writer-journalist Asra Nomani also shared the his recolected the connectin between Bahawalpur and his killing.Nomani wrote on X: ""My friend, WSJ reporter Danny Pearl, went to Bahawalpur in December 2001 with a notebook and a pen. Gen. Pervez Musharraf had just promised he was shutting down Pakistan’s militant groups after a strike by Pakistan’s terrorists against the Parliament in India, and Danny reported on the militant offices in Bahawalpur. He literally knocked on their doors. Dear Dr. @yudapearl, this story is a window into Danny’s reporting enterprise. And because people will wonder: Danny was no cowboy. This was a calculated low-risk reporting trip because no journalist had been targeted for kidnapping in Pakistan. Around that time, Danny sent me an email: “I’m anxious to go to Afghanistan, but I’m not anxious to die.”India's Operation Sindoor, named evocatively after the vermilion worn by married Indian women, symbolising the life tragically cut short in the April 22 Pahalgam attack, has gained symbolic resonance far beyond. In targeting those who harboured the perpetrators of terror not just against India but also the global community, it may have finally closed a painful chapter that began more than two decades ago with Pearl’s death.","Daniel Pearl, the South Asia bureau chief for The Wall Street Journal, was abducted in Karachi while investigating terror links in Pakistan’s intelligence establishment.

No one wants to see an escalating war between two nuclear powers. Russia, France, and Israel are the only ones that have specifically shown understanding publicly for India's right to defend itself against terrorism. America, in principle, should have said something, given that they are the ones that reacted the most strongly against Afghanistan after 9/11,"" Tharoor said.""Surprisingly, China did not take as much of a pro-Pakistan stand. What China has said is suggestive that they are not oblivious of the fact that relations with India were warming. The Indian market is all the more important to China today in the Trumpian world of high tariffs. China needs India in a way that it never needed them before. If there were a real war, they would have been supporting Pakistan. But to prevent a war, China will take a constructive approach in my view,"" the Congress MP said.Meanwhile, India foiled Pakistan's attempts to target military installations in the northern and western regions of the country, a day after the Indian armed forces carried out precision strikes inside Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir as part of 'Operation Sindoor.'According to Indian authorities, Pakistani missiles and drones were ""neutralised by the Integrated Counter-UAS Grid and Air Defence systems.""In response to Pakistan's attacks, the Indian Armed Forces targeted air defence radars and systems at multiple locations within Pakistan, including in Lahore.Following Pakistan's attempt, the Chinese foreign ministry said that it was ""not familiar with the matter"" when asked about reports of Chinese jets being involved in the attack.Earlier, Congress MP and former diplomat Shashi Tharoor said that the recent United Nations Security Council (UNSC) meeting on India-Pakistan tensions did not go in Pakistan's favour, with several member countries raising difficult questions on terrorism and Lashkar-Taiba (Let), a terror outfit under Islamabad's shelter.Referring to unofficial briefings from inside the closed-door session, Tharoor said, ""Everything we hear about this is not official or confirmed, but what we hear, however, from these background meetings is that it did not appear to have gone well for Pakistan as they would have hoped.They are one of the 15 members, they are a member, India is not in the room. In these circumstances, Pakistan would have thought that they had an advantage but the impression is that the delegations asked tough questions, particularly about Lashkar-e-Taiba, and the concerns have largely been about terrorism, how it is extremely dangerous and that it can understandably provoke an Indian reaction.""","The Congress leader said that the Indian market is more important to Beijing today in the ""Trumpian world of high tariffs.

My father's maternal grandfather also served in the British Army and later participated in the 1857 freedom struggle.”Her family resides in the Tandalja locality of Vadodara and she has three brothers and a sister.Qureshi completed her schooling at Kendriya Vidyalaya, EME, and went on to earn a BSc in Chemistry (1992–1995) and an MSc in Biochemistry (1995–1997) from the Faculty of Science at M S University.“She was even pursuing her PhD, but learning about the recruitment of women officers in the Indian Army, she quit the PhD programme and joined the forces,” said Sanjay.For young Indian women seeking meaningful and challenging careers, she had a clear message: “If possible, join the Indian Army.”Southern Army Commander Lt Gen Bipin Rawat in 2016 commended her leadership, noting that the Army believes in equal opportunity and responsibility for all personnel, regardless of gender.""Nine terrorist camps were destroyed. The targets were selected based on credible intelligence and their direct involvement in cross-border terrorism. No military installation in Pakistan was targeted during Operation Sindoor.""Under 'Operation Sindoor', the armed forces on Wednesday targeted and destroyed nine terror hideouts belonging to Jaish-e-Mohammed Lashkar-e-Taiba , and Hizbul Mujahideen in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.This marked India's most decisive strike in response to the recent Pahalgam terror attack , in which 26 civilians were killed.According to the Ministry of Defence, the Indian Air Force conducted precision strikes on four terror sites inside Pakistan and five within PoK. The ministry described the operation as “focused, measured and non-escalatory,” adding that no Pakistani military installations were targeted.“These actions are in direct response to the horrific Pahalgam attack,” the Defence Ministry said in its statement, adding, “We are upholding our commitment to ensure that those responsible for the attack face consequences.” The Indian government later released an official video declaring the mission a success, while Pakistani authorities were reportedly caught off guard.Speaking to news agency ANI, Colonel Qureshi's father Taj Mohammed Qureshi said she has done a ""great thing"" for the country.""We are very proud. Our daughter has done a great thing for our country... Pakistan should be destroyed... My grandfather, my father, and I were all in the army. Now she is, too,"" he told news agency ANI.","Colonel Sofiya Qureshi, originally from Vadodara, hails from a family with a strong military background.

Jalandhar DC Himanshu Aggarwal assured the public that most drones had been neutralised and no civilians were targeted.Earlier on Thursday morning, explosions and the sight of fireballs in the sky triggered panic in Amritsar. Reports of “missile debris” emerged from multiple villages. Around 1am, six loud explosions were heard within a span of seven minutes, followed by a city-wide blackout. While the district administration attributed the noise to possible sonic booms, the event left residents alarmed.Authorities released only a brief statement, saying “Amritsar is safe,” with DC Sakshi Sawhney adding, “We are observing precaution, there is no need to panic.” The city underwent two blackouts that night.

A senior official confirmed a series of blasts that continued for nearly an hour after a brief pause.As panic spread, police patrols increased and sirens were sounded in Barmer multiple times. Officials confirmed that security forces remain on high alert.The situation escalated after Indian armed forces carried out precision strikes in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) on Wednesday, targeting terror launchpads. The strikes were in response to the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, where 26 civilians were killed.A local in Jaisalmer said, ""When blackout happened at 9 in the night, we heard the explosions. Earlier, we thought it was firecrackers, but later we realised it was a real bomb, targeted at us. We never thought of experiencing this. We are happy that our government diffused all the Pakistani drones. There is no atmosphere of fear. Indian air defence system is completely efficient.""In response to the border tensions, Rajasthan chief minister Bhajan Lal Sharma held a high-level review meeting with the chief secretary, Home Secretary, Director General of Police, Director General of Intelligence, and the Additional Director General of Law and Order.The meeting followed Pakistani drone activity intercepted by Indian defences in Jaisalmer.

MOTIHARI/PATNA: The investigation agencies are yet to find out the exact purpose of visit of the four Chinese nationals, who were arrested by Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) for entering India from Nepal through Raxaul in East Champaran district without valid visas on Wednesday.It, however, came out during interrogation that they were supposed to go to back to Hetauda and Lumbini in Nepal, according to official sources.These Chinese nationals, identified through their passports as Den Wijong, Lei Yonghai, He Kuangsheng and Huang Limin, all residents of Hunan City, were apprehended by the SSB on Maitri Bridge in Raxaul on Wednesday evening, and following their arrest under several sections of the Foreigners Act, were sent to judicial custody on Thursday.A Nepali woman, who was acting as a guide for the Chinese nationals, was also interrogated, before eventually being released by the SSB.During questioning, it was discovered that the woman, identified as Anita Kumari, was multilingual, being proficient in Hindi, Nepali, English and Chinese.The woman told the investigation agencies, including NIA, IB and SSB, that she was a guide in Nepal.After detailed questioning, identity verification and checking her phone, the security forces determined that the woman was only working as a guide and subsequently released her.According to the official sources, it also came out during their interrogation that the four Chinese nationals were staying at the home of the Nepali woman in Kathmandu.They had come to Birganj from Kathmandu before entering Raxaul when they were caught during an inspection.Raxaul subdivisional police officer (SDPO) Dhirendra Kumar said all of them were entering India from Nepal on foot.

Watch: AI brings murder victim to life in Arizona Court as family uses avatar in sentencing hearing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-ai-brings-murder-victim-to-life-in-arizona-court-as-family-uses-avatar-in-sentencing-hearing/articleshow/121014447.cms,"Stacey Wales, sister of the late Christopher Pelkey, displays her brother's image at her mother's home in Chandler, Ariz. (Picture credit: AP)





In a landmark moment for the American justice system, the family of Christopher Pelkey used artificial intelligence to allow him to “speak” posthumously at the sentencing of the man convicted of killing him during a 2021 road rage incident in Arizona.Pelkey, a 37-year-old US Army veteran who had served three tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, was fatally shot by Gabriel Paul Horcasitas while both were stopped at a red light in Chandler, Arizona.As per CBS News, Pelkey was walking toward Horcasitas’ car when he was shot in the chest.Last week, Horcasitas was sentenced to 10.5 years in prison for manslaughter.During the sentencing, a nearly four-minute AI-generated video was played in court, showing a digital recreation of Pelkey delivering a victim impact statement The avatar, created using a single photograph and audio from a YouTube video where Pelkey discussed PTSD, greeted the court with a disclaimer: “I am a version of Chris Pelkey recreated through AI that uses my picture and my voice profile.”“It is a shame we encountered each other that day in those circumstances. In another life, we probably could have been friends,” said the AI Pelkey, according to The New York Times. “I believe in forgiveness and in God, who forgives.I always have and I still do”, added the AI avatar.The video, written by Pelkey’s sister Stacey Wales, aimed to reflect his forgiving nature.She was quoted by the BBC saying, “We approached this with ethics and morals because this is a powerful tool... like a hammer, it can build or destroy. We used it to build.”The AI rendering struck a chord with Judge Todd Lang of the Maricopa County Superior Court.“I loved that AI,” he said, as quoted by BBC News. “And as angry as you are, and justifiably angry as the family is, I heard the forgiveness. And I know Mr. Horcasitas appreciated it, but so did I”, Lang added.However, the use of AI in such a personal and emotional court proceeding has raised questions among legal experts. Gary Marchant, a law professor and member of Arizona’s AI committee, was quoted by CBS News as saying that there’s concern that “deepfake evidence” might influence judges and juries. “It’s easy to create, and anyone can do it on a phone,” he warned.Despite these concerns, the AI video was allowed because Arizona law permits victim impact statements in any digital format, explained victims’ rights attorney Jessica Gattuso, as per news agency AP. The video was also supported by nearly 50 letters submitted by family and friends that echoed its message.Horcasitas’ attorney, Jason Lamm, has filed an appeal, suggesting that the judge may have improperly relied on the AI video in sentencing. “However, this may be a situation where they just took it too far,” Lamm was quoted by The New York Times.While the AI avatar was used only in the sentencing phase and not during the trials, of which there were two due to a disclosure error in the first, the incident has prompted broader debate about AI's place in the courtroom.Cynthia Godsoe, a Brooklyn Law School professor, was quoted by The Times as saying that such technology can “inflame emotions more than pictures,” warning courts to tread carefully.But others see potential. As Maura R. Grossman of the American Bar Association’s AI task force noted, “There’s no jury that can be unduly influenced,” and therefore, she did not find it “ethically or legally troubling.”","Christopher Pelkey, a 37-year-old US Army veteran, was fatally shot by Gabriel Paul Horcasitas while both were stopped at a red light in Chandler, Arizona.

"US military begins process to remove up to 1,000 trans personnel under new directive",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-military-begins-process-to-remove-up-to-1000-trans-personnel-under-new-directive/articleshow/121013438.cms,"File photo: US defense secretary Pete Hegseth (Picture credit: AP)





The US department of defense has begun implementing a directive to remove transgender troops from military service, following a green light from the Supreme Court earlier this week.US defense secretary Pete Hegseth issued a memo on Thursday outlining that openly identifying transgender personnel must voluntarily leave the service by June 6, or face forced separation.As per news agency Reuters, the internal instructions give active-duty service members a deadline of June 6 to self-identify, while those in reserve components have until July 7. “On conclusion of the self-identification eligibility window, the Military Departments will initiate involuntary separation processes,” Hegseth said in the memo.The move marks a swift return to US President Donald Trump’s 2017 policy banning transgender individuals from serving openly, which had been overturned by his successor, then-US President Joe Biden, in 2021.Trump had made ending transgender military inclusion a key campaign pledge, and his administration has consistently worked to limit transgender rights. His January 20 executive order declared that the US government would only recognise two immutable biological sexes: male and female.According to news agency AP, about 1,000 transgender troops have already identified themselves since the earlier directive in February, which had been on hold due to court challenges. Those individuals will now “begin the voluntary separation process,” Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell confirmed.Emily Shilling, a Navy commander and one of the plaintiffs who sued to stop the policy was quoted by NBC News as saying, “I know this decision will cause fear and doubt in the ranks... To those feeling shaken, I say this: stand tall. You are not alone.”Hegseth, a former Fox News host known for far-right positions, made his stance clear on social media, writing, “After a SCOTUS victory for @POTUS, TRANS is out at the DOD.”He declared, “No more pronouns, no more climate-change obsessions, no more dudes in dresses. We’re done with that s***,” reported AP.According to the news outlet Rolling Stone, medical records will be used to identify service members diagnosed with gender dysphoria, those under treatment, or showing related symptoms.Troops falling under these categories will not be allowed to enlist or remain in the military unless they meet specific exemption criteria, such as proving support for warfighting activities or showing stability in their birth-assigned sex for 36 months without significant distress.The policy allows only limited waivers. Even with an exemption, service members would still be treated in line with their biological sex for housing, uniforms, and formal address such as ""Sir"" or ""Ma’am"".US department of defense spent approximately $52 million on gender-related medical care, including hormone therapy and surgeries, between 2015 and 2024. There are currently around 4,240 troops diagnosed with gender dysphoria in the active duty, National Guard, and Reserve forces, though advocacy groups estimate the real number is higher.LGBTQ+ advocates condemned the order. Jennifer Levi, a senior director at GLAD Law, was quoted by Reuters as saying, “It is senseless to fast-track people out of the military who are meeting standards and putting lives on the line to defend the country.”While a Gallup poll in February showed 58% of Americans still support allowing transgender individuals to serve, that number has dropped significantly from 71% in 2019.","US defense secretary Pete Hegseth issued a memo on Thursday outlining that openly identifying transgender personnel must voluntarily leave the service by June 6, or face forced separation.

North Korea says leader Kim supervised missile tests simulating nuclear strikes against rivals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/north-korea-says-leader-kim-supervised-missile-tests-simulating-nuclear-strikes-against-rivals/articleshow/121014196.cms,"AP file photo





SEOUL: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un supervised tests of short-range ballistic missile systems that simulated nuclear counterstrikes against US and South Korean forces, state media said Friday, as the North continued to blame its rivals for escalating tensions through their joint military exercises.The report came a day after South Korea's military detected multiple launches from North Korea 's eastern coast and assessed that the tests could also be related to the country's weapons exports to Russia during its war in Ukraine.North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency said Thursday's tests involved a mobile ballistic missile system apparently modeled after Russia's Iskander, as well as 600-millimeter multiple rocket launchers that South Korean officials classify as ballistic due to their self-propulsion and guided flight.Both are part of a growing lineup of weapons systems that the North says could be armed with ""tactical"" nuclear weapons for battlefield use.KCNA said the tests were intended to train military units operating missile and rocket systems to more effectively execute attacks under the North's nuclear weapons control system and ensure a swift response to a nuclear crisis.The agency criticized the United States and its ""vassal states"" for expanding joint military exercises on and around the Korean Peninsula, which the North claims are preparations for nuclear war, and said Thursday's launches demonstrated the ""rapid counteraction posture"" of its forces.Kim stressed the need to strengthen the role of his nuclear forces in both deterring and fighting war, and called for continued efforts to improve combat readiness and precision strike capabilities, KCNA said.South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said multiple missiles of various types were launched from the area around the eastern port city of Wonsan on Thursday from about 8:10 to 9:20 a.m., with the farthest traveling about 800 kilometers (497 miles).Lee Sung Joon, spokesperson for the Joint Chiefs, said in a briefing the North Korean launches were possibly intended to test the performance of weapons it plans to export, as the country continues to send military equipment and troops to fuel Russia's warfighting against Ukraine.Japanese defence minister Gen Nakatani told reporters that none of the North Korean missiles reached Japan's exclusive economic zone and there was no damage to vessels or aircraft in the area.It was the North's first known ballistic activity since March 10, when it fired several ballistic missiles hours after US and South Korean troops began an annual combined military exercise, and the country's sixth launch event of the year.Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have escalated in recent months as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un continues to accelerate the development of his nuclear and missile program and supply weapons and troops to support Russia's war against Ukraine.Thursday's launch came a day after North Korean state media said Kim urged munition workers to boost the production of artillery shells amid his deepening alignment with Moscow.","North Korean leader Kim Jong Un supervised tests of short-range ballistic missile systems.

Former US President Joe Biden has said he takes some responsibility for Donald Trump’s election win in 2024 but strongly defended his time in office, blaming a lack of messaging and Republican obstruction for voter dissatisfaction.In an interview on ‘The View’, Biden said, “Yes, I do,” when asked if he bore any responsibility for the Democrats’ defeat. “Because look, I was in charge, and he won, so I take responsibility.”However, he also claimed that if he had stayed in the race, he could have beaten Trump, a view he’s expressed before.Biden added he was not surprised that former Vice President Kamala Harris lost, saying her opponents “went the sexist route,” while also citing the “phenomenal negative impact” of the Covid-19 pandemic.Still, he called Harris “first rate” and said she faces a “difficult decision” about her political future. “I hope she stays fully engaged,” he said, but noted, “We have a lot of really good candidates as well.”Biden exited the race after a widely criticised debate performance against Trump, which raised fresh concerns about his age. He admitted the debate was a “bad, bad night” but denied it reflected a deeper cognitive decline.“There’s nothing to sustain that,” he said, adding he “did a pretty damn good job the last six months” in office.Dr Jill Biden also appeared in the interview and gave a firm defence of her husband’s capabilities. “He’d get up, put in a full day, and then at night... he was still on the phone, reading his briefings, working with staff. I mean, it was nonstop,” she said.Biden rejected suggestions that he pressured Harris not to publicly distance herself from his administration. As per CBS News, he “did not advise her” to say there were no differences between their policies and added that her remarks had been “misinterpreted.”The former president also took aim at Trump, accusing him of having “the worst 100 days any president’s ever had.” When asked why Trump keeps mentioning him, Biden replied, “I beat him,” referencing his 2020 victory.Biden dismissed Trump’s claim that pardons signed with an autopen, including for family members, were “void,” responding sharply: “Oh, he’s vacant.”The interview comes as both Bidens reemerge in public life.

Trump names Fox News host Jeanine Pirro as interim top federal prosecutor in Washington after dropping Ed Martin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-names-fox-news-host-jeanine-pirro-as-interim-top-federal-prosecutor-in-washington-after-dropping-ed-martin/articleshow/121010740.cms,"AP file p

.





US president Donald Trump on Thursday named Fox News host Jeanine Pirro as the interim top federal prosecutor for Washington, D.C., replacing his original pick, Ed Martin Jr., whose nomination faced heavy opposition.The announcement was made on Trump’s Truth Social account, where he praised Pirro as “incredibly well qualified” and “one of the top district attorneys” in New York’s history.Pirro, a former judge and three-term district attorney in Westchester County, New York, joined Fox News in 2006 and now co-hosts ""The Five."" Her appointment follows a pattern of Trump tapping Fox News figures for senior posts — including Pete Hegseth, now Defence Secretary.Trump pulled Martin’s nomination earlier in the day after Republican senators raised concerns about his defence of Capitol rioters and lack of legal experience. Martin, who had never prosecuted a case before, drew criticism during his brief tenure for controversial staff changes and social media posts.Pirro’s legal background stands in contrast. A 1975 Albany Law School graduate, she helped establish one of the country’s first domestic violence prosecution units. She also ran unsuccessfully for New York attorney general in 2006 after briefly attempting to challenge then-Senator Hillary Clinton.While Pirro's media career has included public support for Trump, it has also brought legal trouble. In 2021, she was named in a $2.7 billion defamation suit by Smartmatic for spreading false claims about the 2020 election.","Jeanine Pirro is a former judge and three-term district attorney in Westchester County, New York.

‘Lying for a 20-second donation hit’: Kash Patel clashes with Madeline Dean over 'FBI weaponisation',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/lying-for-a-20-second-donation-hit-kash-patel-clashes-with-madeline-dean-over-fbi-weaponisation/articleshow/120982391.cms,"



FBI Director Kash Patel and Democratic Rep. Madeline Dean clashed during a heated House subcommittee hearing , with Patel accusing Dean of misrepresenting facts and Dean charging that the FBI under Patel had been weaponised to pursue political enemies Dean, who served as an impeachment manager during President Trump’s second impeachment trial, launched a pointed line of questioning at Patel. “As you and the president continue to weaponise and investigate his perceived enemies... when can I, a former impeachment manager, expect the FBI at my door?” she asked.Patel shot back, “Ma’am. You want to know who was targeted by a weaponised FBI? Me. You want to know how and why? You want to know what I'm doing to fix it?”As Dean attempted to move on, Patel continued, “You should read the book, because there's no enemies list in that book. There are people that violated their constitutional obligations and their duties to the American people, and they were rightly called out. And you should give that book to every one of your constituents so they can read about it.”Dean then accused Patel of dishonesty during his Senate confirmation hearings, referring to his denial of involvement in the firing of FBI officials after the January 6 riot and his repeated appearances on the podcast of Stu Peters, whom she labelled “an anti-Semitic Holocaust denier”.She asked, “Should we worry more about your memory or your veracity?”Patel hit back strongly. “We should worry more about your lack of candour. You're accusing me of committing perjury. Tell the American people how I broke the law and committed a felony. Have the audacity to actually put the facts forward instead of lying for political banter so you can have a 20 second donation hit.”He added, “The answer is both. I believe that the answer is you're failing. Not me.”Dean insisted the FBI’s rank-and-file deserved better. “I believe that the members of the FBI... deserve the very best, deserve extraordinary independence, deserve freedom from the fears of being investigated.”The tense exchange came as Patel also faced criticism over a proposed $500 million cut to the FBI's 2026 budget, backed by the Trump White House. Though the administration framed the cuts as a move to “streamline” the bureau, Patel warned such reductions would harm the agency’s capacity to tackle violent crime.“We need more than what has been proposed,” he told lawmakers, adding that the FBI was working on relocating 1,000 staff to areas most affected by violent crime. “We’ve taken a process... and said, ‘Where are some of the most violent crime places in America?’”When pressed on which positions would be cut if the funding decrease goes ahead, Patel responded, “At this time, we have not looked at who to cut. We are focusing our energies on how not to have them cut.”","FBI Director Kash Patel and Democratic Rep. Madeline Dean clashed during a heated House subcommittee hearing.

NEW DELHI: Amid the threat of an all-out war between India and Pakistan, US secretary of state Marco Rubio dialled his counterpart S Jaishankar and Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif , seeking immediate de-escalation and expressing support for direct dialogue between the two countries.While the US readouts of the two conversations said Rubio encouraged continued efforts to improve communications, Jaishankar later on X said he told Rubio that India will firmly counter any escalation by Pakistan.In the case of Shehbaz, while he expressed sorrow for the reported loss of ""civilian lives in the current conflict"", Rubio reiterated his calls for Pakistan to take concrete steps to end any support for terrorist groups . Pakistan has accused India of killing civilians but India has maintained that its May 7 strikes were targeted only at terrorists and their infrastructure, not civilians.In the case of India, he reiterated his condolences for the terrorist attack in Pahalgam and reaffirmed the US's commitment to work with India in the fight against terrorism . Appreciating the US support on terrorism, Jaishankar told Rubio that India will firmly counter any attempts at escalation by Pakistan, underlining India's measured response to cross-border terrorism. The conversation took place in the middle of fresh clashes between India and Pakistan late on Thursday that sparked fears of a major escalation.Jaishankar also spoke to his EU and Italy counterparts late evening, as tensions soared.Jaishankar also told his visiting Iranian counterpart, Abbas Araqchi, that it's not India's intention to escalate, but if there's any military attack on India, it will be met with a ""very, very firm response"". Jaishankar also met Saudi Arabia junior foreign minister Adel Aljubeir and, as he said in a post on X, shared India's perspective on firmly countering terrorism.While the Iranian minister was in India on a pre-arranged visit for the regular India-Iran joint commission meeting, Aljubeir arrived here for an unannounced visit. Both countries have been in touch with top Indian and Pakistani leadership, looking to defuse tensions.Araqchi and Aljubeir both urged restraint and de-escalation. ""We hope that India and Pakistan will prevent the escalation of tension in the region. Our region needs peace, especially to expand economic cooperation between regional countries, and we hope this will happen,"" said Araqchi.The EU also strongly urged de-escalation, while condemning terrorism. Every state has the duty and the right lawfully to protect its citizens from acts of terror, said the EU in a statement. ""The EU calls on both parties to exercise restraint, to de-escalate tensions and desist from further attacks to safeguard civilian lives on both sides. The EU urges both sides to engage in dialogue. It is vital that India and Pakistan also live up to their obligations under international law and take all measures possible to protect civilian lives,"" said the statement.Amid global calls for restraint, foreign secretary Vikram Misri said there has been a recognition among the international community of the fact that the Pahalgam attack was of barbaric nature, and of India's right to respond to it. ""There is also a recognition of the fact that in responding, we have been nothing but responsible and have done so in a restrained, measured, and non-escalatory manner.

Pentagon on Thursday announced it will start removing openly transgender service members from the US military, following the supreme court’s recent decision allowing enforcement of the Trump administration ’s long-pending ban.Defence secretary Pete Hegseth issued the directive within hours of the ruling, saying that roughly 1,000 transgender personnel who have publicly identified will now be moved out of service. Others have 30 days to self-report before the department begins examining medical records to identify additional cases.In a social media post after the decision, Hegseth wrote “No more trans at DoD,” reinforcing his earlier remarks at a special operations conference in Florida, where he said the military was abandoning “wokeness and weakness.”He also told the audience, “No more pronouns,” in reference to gender identity practices within the forces.According to Pentagon data, 4,240 active duty, national guard, and reserve troops had been diagnosed with gender dysphoria as of December 2024. However, officials acknowledge that the actual number may be higher, given that not all individuals have come forward or received formal diagnoses.The new policy mirrors one introduced in February but halted due to ongoing litigation.

The Trump administration's latest trade deal with Britain unfairly penalizes US automakers that have partnered with Canada and Mexico, a trade group representing Detroit automakers said Thursday.In a sharply-worded statement, the American Automotive Policy Council (AAPC) said the US-UK trade deal ""hurts American automakers, suppliers, and auto workers,"" according to the group's president Matt Blunt.The deal unveiled Thursday between US President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer lowers the tariff on British vehicles to 10 percent from 27.5 percent on the first 100,000 cars shipped from Britain to the United States.In contrast, AAPC members Ford , General Motors Company and Jeep-maker Stellantis now face import tariffs of 25 percent on autos assembled in Canada and Mexico.The Detroit companies organized their supply chains around the 2020 US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which Trump negotiated in his first term.""We are disappointed that the administration prioritized the UK ahead of our North American partners,"" Blunt said. ""Under this deal, it will now be cheaper to import a UK vehicle with very little US content than a USMCA compliant vehicle from Mexico or Canada that is half American parts.""Trump last week unveiled some steps to lessen the impact of tariffs on imported auto parts in moves applauded by GM and Ford.The Trump administration will allow companies that assemble autos in the United States to deduct a fraction of the cost of imported parts for two years to give the industry enough time to relocate supply chains.In another change, the administration said companies wouldn't face a 25 percent levy on imported steel or aluminum in addition to a 25 percent levy for an imported vehicle.But last weeks' changes did not soften the 25 percent tariff on imported finished autos.The Trump administration plans to negotiate separate agreements with Japan, South Korea and the European Union, all of which export finished autos to the United States.""We hope this preferential access for UK vehicles over North American ones does not set a precedent for future negotiations with Asian and European competitors,"" Blunt said.","The American Automotive Policy Council says the US-UK trade deal ""hurts American automakers, suppliers, and auto workers"" The deal lowers the tariff on British vehicles to 10 percent from 27.5 percent on the first 100,000 cars shipped from Britain to the United States.

US president Donald Trump on Thursday confirmed a trade framework with the United Kingdom that reduces tariffs on autos and metals while keeping the baseline 10% tariff as it is. The announcement followed a phone call with UK prime minister Keir Starmer Under the plan, US tariffs on British cars will drop from 27.5% to 10% for a quota of 100,000 vehicles. Tariffs on steel and aluminium will be removed. In return, the UK will increase purchases of US agricultural goods, simplify customs for American products, and cut import taxes on around 2,500 items, including olive oil, wine, and sports equipment.The Republican president indicated that other countries negotiating trade deals with the US could face steeper import taxes.Referring to the UK’s 10% tariff rate, Trump said, “That’s a low number,” and argued that nations with which the US runs trade deficits—and which he claimed had treated the US unfairly—would be subject to higher tariffs.US stocks meanwhile surged Thursday as investor optimism grew following the announcement of the trade deal between the United States and the United Kingdom that could ease recession fears by lowering select tariffs and restrictions.Earlier, during simultaneous press conferences in London and Washington, Keir Starmer appeared via video link from the White House alongside Donald Trump, calling the US-UK trade agreement “a truly fantastic and historic day.”","US president Donald Trump confirmed a trade framework with the United Kingdom that reduces tariffs on autos and metals.
