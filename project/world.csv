‘Have to do everything not to …’: Zelenskyy’s measured message on India buying Russian oil; hopeful after meeting Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/have-to-do-everything-not-to-zelenskyys-measured-message-on-india-buying-russian-oil-hopeful-after-meeting-trump/articleshow/124082624.cms,"Volodymyr Zelenskyy (left), PM Narendra Modi (PTI)

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has expressed hope that stronger diplomatic engagement between India and the West could prompt New Delhi to reconsider its energy imports from Russia. In an interview with Fox News, Zelenskyy underscored the need to keep India aligned with the Western bloc amid the ongoing war with Russia.He also called on the West, particularly the United States and Europe, to deepen strategic engagement with India and discourage its energy ties with Russia.“We have to do everything not to withdraw India, and they'll change their attitude to the Russian energy sector. I'm sure,” Zelenskyy told Fox’s Bret Baier, suggesting that greater diplomatic efforts could encourage India to rethink its approach to sourcing energy from Russia.While acknowledging concerns over India’s energy imports, he expressed confidence in US President Donald Trump’s ability to manage those issues. “Yes, we had these questions with energy, but I think President Trump can manage it,” he said.His remarks came in the broader context of discussing global alignments, particularly countries perceived as closer to Russia. Commenting on Iran, the Ukrainian president stated: “Iran will never be on our side.Because it will never be on the side of the United States.”He went on to add, “I think India's mostly with us,” reinforcing his belief that India remains a potential strategic partner for the West.Zelenskyy also indicated that closer cooperation between Europe and India could help shift New Delhi’s position. “With Europeans, make more close and strong relationship with India,” he added.He also spoke positively about his recent interaction with Trump, describing him as supportive of Ukraine's position. “President Trump was more positive. He showed that he wants to support Ukraine to the very end,” Zelenskyy said.“We are ready to finish this war as soon as possible. He wants and I want and our people want,” he added, while also noting that Trump recognises the challenges posed by Russia. “He understands that Putin doesn't want that and is not winning but he says to everyone that he’ll win.”","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has expressed hope that stronger diplomatic engagement between India and the West could prompt New Delhi to reconsider its energy imports from Russia.

RUDRAPUR: A man from Udham Singh Nagar who had recently travelled to Russia for higher studies was allegedly coerced into joining the Russian army and sent to the war front in Ukraine, his family said, adding they have had no contact with him since early Sept and are now desperate for help. The family of Rakesh Kumar, 30, has written to the ministry of external affairs (MEA), sought support from the Indian embassy in Moscow, and approached local officials in a bid to bring him back home.Rakesh, a resident of Kushmoth village in Shaktifarm under Sitarganj tehsil, had left for Russia on Aug 7 after securing admission to St Petersburg University on a study visa. However, within a few days, he began hinting at being in a troubling situation, suggesting things were not going as planned.His elder brother, Deepu Maurya, said the last time they had a direct conversation was on Aug 30, when Rakesh informed them that he had been forcibly drafted into the Russian army and would soon be deployed to the war zone in Ukraine. After that call, his phone went unreachable. The family later received a photo of Rakesh in a Russian military uniform, which only heightened their fears and confirmed their worst suspicions.A few days later, Rakesh called again, this time from an unfamiliar Russian number. In a short and distressed conversation, he told them that his passport and personal documents had been seized, his official emails had been deleted, and that he had undergone military training in the Donbas region before being sent to the battlefield. That was the last they heard from him.""We do not even know if he is alive. We just want the govt to bring him back home safely,"" said Deepu. The family wrote to MEA on Sept 5 and has also reached out to elected representatives and the local administration.This is not the first such case to surface in recent months. At least 20 Indian nationals - mostly from Punjab and Haryana - have claimed they were tricked into going to Russia on the pretext of education or employment, only to be coerced into joining Russian military.","Rakesh Kumar, 30, had left for Russia on Aug 7 after securing admission to St Petersburg University on a study visa.

Heartfelt thanks to the court for upholding faith in justice.”Targeting the ruling BJP , he said those who filed “fake cases” against Khan have now learned that “every lie has an expiry date and so does every conspiracy.”The former CM added that Azam Khan would continue to stand with the neglected and the oppressed and remain a symbol of “emotional unity” while carrying forward the struggle for social justice with socialist values.Speaking to reporters, Yadav reiterated his gratitude to the court and expressed hope that no fresh “false cases” would be filed by the BJP government in the state.“SP leader Azam Khan has been released from jail. I would like to thank the Court for this. We, the Samajwadis, believed that the Court would do justice.

VARANASI/NEW DELHI: A hijack scare gripped an Air India Express flight from Bengaluru to Varanasi Monday after a man tried to unlock the cockpit door mid-air by entering random digits on its keypad, triggering a security buzzer inside the flight deck.Cabin crew confronted the passenger, identified as Mani R, who claimed he was a first-time flyer looking for the lavatory.

HYDERABAD: The banned CPI (Maoist)'s central committee has ordered senior neta Mallojula Venugopal, 69, to immediately surrender his weapons, warning that People's Guerrilla Army would forcibly seize them if he failed to comply.Venugopal, also known as Sonu and Bhupati, recently expressed readiness to lay down arms. Party netas dismissed his remarks as false propaganda aimed at weakening the organisation, accu-sing him of using talk of ceasefire and peace as a pretext for surrender. Telangana's Special Intelligence Branch confirmed the committee's instructions but said there was no confirmation of Venugopal's expulsion.The dispute escalated after a press release dated Aug 15 and attributed to Maoist spokesperson Abhay, suggested the group intended to ""temporarily renounce arm-ed struggle"" and ""lay down arms"". The central committee and politburo rejected the stand, insisting it was Venugopal's personal view. Traditionally, statements are issued under the alias Abhay, a role Venugopal assumed after the 2010 encounter killing of spokesperson Cherukuri Rajkumar.Venugopal has been underground since the late 1970s. A Brahmin from Telangana with a commerce degree, he is regarded more as a political ideologue than a field commander. He is the younger brother of Mallojula Koteshwar Rao, or Kishenji, a politburo member killed in a 2011 encounter in Bengal. Reports in May suggested Venugopal was preparing to surrender and reunite with his wife Tarakka, who earlier gave up arms to Maharashtra police.","Venugopal, also known as Sonu and Bhupati, recently expressed readiness to lay down arms.

Such episodic volcanic eruption witnessed in 1991, '04 & '05: Official

India's only active volcano located on the uninhabited Barren Island in Andaman Sea erupted on Sept 20, presenting a visual extravaganza rare for south Asia. The episode was in fact the result of an earthquake of magnitude 4.2 that hit the region two days before the event.Though the eruption was minor with no immediate risk to human settlements in Indonesian archipelago, the episode - fourth since 1991 - can't be overlooked as the island lies over a fault that moved, causing the Dec 2004 tsunami.The fault's coordinates fall on the same latitude as the Barren Island volcano and in the vicinity of the longitude of the quake that made the magma chamber apt for ""pre-mature magmatic eruption"", said O P Mishra, director, National Centre for Seismology.O P Mishra said it was ""earthquake shaking intensity"" in magma chamber of Barren volcano that erupted this month. Barren Island is roughly circular with a diameter of approximately 3.2km where the volcano rises nearly 2km above the sea floor. Its average height is 300m above mean sea level.""Andaman-Nicobar Island is located in the subduction complex consisting of the down going Indian plate intruding to the mantle of the overriding Sunda Plate where continuous earthquakes of moderate to strong strengths used to occur besides the micro seismicity in the area,"" said Mishra.There are two magma related lava volcanoes located along active West Andaman Fault. Though Barren Volcano has been active for years, the eruption is intermittent and sporadic as and when magma chamber at the depths of 18-20km are activated. Lava and magmatic eruptions occur from time to time due to disturbance of the magma chamber by seismic energy generated from strong to moderate earthquakes that upwelled lavas to the surface through volcanic vents. ""This type of episodic volcanic eruption was witnessed in 1991, 2004, 2005, and now in 2025,"" said Mishra.He said the lava and magma persists and remains in the moving state and is pushed upward once the 'earthquake shaking' tries to bring the hot materials to the surface through cracks and fractures widened by the continuous seismically active cycle. The other volcano in the region, Narcondam, is, however, dormant at present.","India's only active volcano located on the uninhabited Barren Island in Andaman Sea erupted on Sept 20.

Ryan Routh, the man found guilty of plotting to assassinate Donald Trump, attempted to stab himself in the neck with a pen moments after a Florida jury convicted him on all counts.The dramatic incident unfolded in Judge Aileen Cannon’s courtroom on Tuesday, leaving US Marshals swarming and dragging him out.According to ABC News, the 59-year-old lunged at his throat with a security-approved pen designed to prevent serious injury.He suffered only bruises and marks before being restrained by four armed officers and removed from the courtroom.His daughter, Sara, shouted, “Dad, I love you. Don’t do anything. I will get you out,” before being escorted out herself for calling the proceedings “rigged.”""He didn't hurt anybody. This is not fair. This is all rigged. You guys are a******s"", she shouted.Routh was brought back into court in shackles and told by Judge Cannon that his sentencing would go ahead on December 18. He now faces life imprisonment.Earlier, jurors had deliberated for just two hours before convicting Routh on charges linked to his plan to assassinate Trump at his West Palm Beach golf course in 2024. Prosecutors said he had invested thousands of dollars in weapons and made repeated trips to a sniper’s perch near the sixth green, amassing over 90 hours of surveillance.Assistant US Attorney Christopher Browne told the jury, “There is no doubt — reasonable or otherwise — the defendant intended to kill Donald Trump.”As per CNN, jurors had reviewed the rifle, ammunition, and magazine linked to Routh before reaching their verdict. Despite representing himself, Routh argued he never intended to fire.During his own 55-minute closing argument, Routh insisted he lacked the capacity to kill. “The prime opportunity was there for the defendant to shoot the president. Why was the trigger not pulled?” he told jurors, comparing his supposed plan to an unattainable fantasy. He argued that his rifle was never brandished to shoot Trump or the Secret Service agent who spotted him, dismissing prosecution evidence as “a blatant fabrication. ”However, prosecutors countered that Routh had researched Trump’s movements, acquired military-grade equipment, and even texted his children hours before the planned attack. One FBI witness detailed phone records, Google searches for rallies and traffic cameras, and preparations for a getaway, including searches for flights to Mexico, as per CNN.Routh was arrested on Interstate 95 after fleeing the course, following a tip from a witness who saw him leave the area.","Ryan Routh, 59, lunged at his throat with a security-approved pen designed to prevent serious injury.

Super Typhoon Ragasa: At least 14 dead after Taiwan barrier lake bursts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/super-typhoon-ragasa-at-least-14-dead-after-taiwan-barrier-lake-bursts-more-than-260-trapped/articleshow/124080955.cms,"



The bursting of a barrier lake in Taiwan’s eastern Hualien County has killed at least 14 people, officials said Wednesday, as rescue teams continued operations after Super Typhoon Ragasa unleashed torrential rains across the island.“As of 7 am (Wednesday), 14 people are confirmed dead and 18 were reported injured,” Lee Kuan-ting, a Hualien County Government press official told AFP. “Thirty missing was the figure last night, released by the National Fire Agency, and our teams are still searching,” he added.The disaster struck Tuesday afternoon when the decades-old barrier lake on the upper Mataian Creek, formed by an earlier landslide, burst under the force of heavy rainfall. The floodwaters washed away a bridge and inundated a nearby town, trapping more than 260 people.“In some places, water temporarily rose as high as the second floor of a house and was about one floor in the town centre, where the water has been receding,” Lee Lung-sheng, deputy chief of Hualien County Fire Department, told AFP. “About 263 people were trapped and moved up to higher ground when the river suddenly rose. They are not in immediate danger, but they are very worried about the high water.”Authorities said the stranded residents were asked to remain in place until waters receded. Two people were initially reported missing, and search operations are still ongoing.Footage released by Taiwan’s National Fire Agency showed flooded streets, submerged vehicles and uprooted trees in Hualien County. Across Taiwan, more than 7,600 people were evacuated due to the typhoon, including 3,100 residents moved beforehand near the creek area.Super Typhoon Ragasa had earlier battered the northern Philippines before hitting Taiwan, forcing thousands from their homes with strong winds and relentless downpours. Taiwan, which lies in the path of frequent tropical storms from July to October, faced a similar disaster in July when Typhoon Danas killed two people and injured hundreds after dumping more than 20 inches of rain across the south.","At least 14 people have been confirmed dead after a barrier lake burst in Taiwan.

Donald Trump’s remarks spark backlash during emotional memorial

Family forgiveness contrasts political tension

The memorial service for conservative activist Charlie Kirk on September 21 drew national attention, not only for the tributes but also for the controversial remarks made by U.S. President Donald Trump. Speaking at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, Trump praised Kirk’s kindness but admitted he did not share the same philosophy when it came to dealing with opponents.Donald Trump described Kirk as “a missionary with a noble spirit and a great purpose” who wished well even for his adversaries. However, he quickly added, “That’s where I disagreed with Charlie. I hate my opponent and I don’t want the best for them. I’m sorry. I am sorry Erika.”The comments immediately drew criticism. USA Today sports contributor and NFL analyst Lindsey reacted sharply on X, writing: “I mean this is absolutely insane for a president to say,” calling out the divisive tone during what was meant to be a unifying moment of remembrance.The memorial also highlighted a striking contrast between Donald Trump’s rhetoric and the message from Kirk’s widow, Erika.Addressing attendees, she said of her husband’s accused killer: “That man, that young man – I forgive him. I forgive him because it was what Christ did, and it is what Charlie would do.”Her words underscored the faith-driven forgiveness Kirk himself was known to preach, even as political figures used the platform to air personal beliefs.Also Read: ""It's not appropriate"": Jerry Jones says no special video tribute for Micah Parsons ahead of Week 4 clash with Packers Kirk, who was assassinated on September 10 while speaking at Utah Valley University, left behind his wife and two children.

"Ragging horror in Tamil Nadu: ITI student stripped, hit on private parts with slipper; warden suspended",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/iti-student-ragged-at-tn-hostel-three-boys-booked/articleshow/124077990.cms,"



MADURAI: Madurai rural district police on Tuesday booked three minor boys for ragging a 15-year-old student of a govt Industrial Training Institute (ITI) inside a room of the govt kallar hostel in Checkanurani. The matter came to light after a video of the incident was circulated on social media, fuelling public outrage.Police said the victim, hailing from Theni district, is a first year student at the ITI. On Sept 18, the three accused senior students stripped the boy, humiliated him and beat him up in the hostel room. The boys also hit the victim’s private parts with a slipper. The incident was recorded by another boy on a mobile phone, and the 39-second video circulated on social media platforms.Madurai district superintendent of police B K Arvind said that based on a complaint from the victim’s father, Checkanurani police registered a case and picked up the three accused for inquiry. Two of them hailed from Madurai and one from Theni. They were booked under sections 115 (2), 133, 351 (2) Of BNS r/w 4, 7 of Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Ragging Act, 1997, including for assault and criminal intimidation.Police clarified that the victim was not from a scheduled caste (SC), but one of the accused boys was.Meanwhile, the warden of the govt Kallar college hostel was suspended for not ensuring the safety of an inmate. Officials from the education department also launched a probe into the incident. The three accused minors were suspended by the ITI as well.Opposition leaders, including AIADMK general secretary Edappadi K Palaniswami, strongly condemned the incident. “Renaming these govt hostels as ‘social justice/harmony’ hostels will not change anything, social justice needs to be ensured. Education alone is not enough but quality is needed in govt institutions and discipline needs to be taught,” he said in a social media post on X platform.R Murali, state president, People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), Tamil Nadu , highlighted the need to set up anti-ragging committees in govt ITIs just like in colleges. “Students of govt ITIs are often from downtrodden and economically poor backgrounds. Orientation programmes to help new students develop positive relationships with older students, and better monitoring are much-needed,” he said.","Police said the victim, hailing from Theni district, is a first year student at the ITI.

Azam Khan walks free: Samajwadi Party stalwart rules out joining BSP; convoy drama sparks chaos in Rampur,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/azam-walks-free-after-23-months-rules-out-joining-bsp/articleshow/124075659.cms,"



BAREILLY/LUCKNOW: Samajwadi Party (SP) national general secretary and former minister Azam Khan walked out of Sitapur jail on Tuesday after spending 23 months behind bars. His release came following bail granted by the Allahabad high court. As he stepped out of prison, a massive convoy of supporters trailed his motorcade from Sitapur through Shahjahanpur and Bareilly to his hometown Rampur, despite prohibitory orders under BNSS section 163 imposed by the district administration to ""prevent any untoward incident."" A large number of supporters still managed to reach near the jail with their vehicles, causing significant traffic congestion. Sitapur traffic police issued challans to 73 vehicles, amounting to approximately Rs 1.5 lakh.After coming out, Khan said, ""Many thanks to everyone. Prayers for all those who stood by me."" Addressing speculation about joining the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), he added, ""Those speculating can answer that. I met no one in jail, nor was I allowed phone calls. For five years, I was completely cut off from the outside world. For now, I will seek medical attention. Then I will think about what to do next.""Rumors of Azam joining forces with Mayawati gained momentum following reports that his wife, former MP Tazeen Fatima, had met BSP supremo Mayawati in Delhi regarding the matter, and that Azam might participate in the party's mega rally scheduled in Lucknow on Oct 9.The BSP, however, remained evasive on the issue, with the party's lone sitting MLA, Um Shankar Singh, claiming ignorance about any such meeting. He did note, however, that Azam's entry into the party would strengthen it.If Azam were to join the BSP, the move is expected to help the party reclaim influence among certain sections of Muslim voters, particularly in Western UP areas around his political bastion of Rampur. Questions remain about the role Azam might assume within the BSP. With Mayawati leading the party and Akash Anand seen as her heir and second-in-command, Azam could be projected as the Muslim face of the party.Khan was accompanied by his sons, Adeeb and Abdullah. ""Azam is the hero of the day. I am here with all his supporters to welcome him. I have nothing more to say. Whatever has to be said, my father will say after coming out of jail,"" Adeeb said.Supporters lined the route, with Khan stopping briefly at a hotel in Bareilly, where he waved from inside. At the Rampur border, he clashed with police after his convoy was halted, asking, ""Why harass us? How long will this oppression last? Allow all vehicles to proceed to Rampur. None of your arrangements are proper."" Ultimately, his car and five others were allowed to proceed, while the rest remained stopped, prompting heated exchanges between supporters and police. Officials cited security concerns, permitting only five vehicles at a time.Upon reaching Rampur, hundreds of supporters greeted him. ""We prayed day and night for his release. We cannot comment on why he was jailed or who jailed him, but our prayers are answered, and he is here with us,"" said supporter Anwar Hussain.Meanwhile, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav posted on X, saying, ""Azam's release is a moment of relief and happiness not only for him and his family but also for all believers in justice. Thanks to the court for sustaining faith in justice. Today, those filing false cases have learned that every lie and conspiracy has a limit.""Moradabad MP Ruchi Vira said, ""The party would celebrate the day as a victory of justice. We had faith in the judiciary and will continue to have it. No other politician has been harassed as much as he (Azam) has been.""Azam's legal troubles began in Feb 2020, when he, his wife Tazeen and son Abdullah surrendered in Rampur over a forged birth certificate case. Over the following years, he faced multiple charges, including forgery, land grabbing and theft. In Oct 2022, he was convicted of hate speech and sentenced to three years in prison, disqualifying him from the Uttar Pradesh assembly. After spending 27 months in jail, he secured interim bail from the Supreme Court in May 2022.Khan's sons, Abdullah and Adeeb, have faced multiple legal challenges over the years, primarily linked to allegations of forgery, land encroachment and financial irregularities. Abdullah was accused in a birth certificate forgery case, allegedly obtaining multiple certificates to meet eligibility criteria for elections, though he has not been convicted. He, along with his mother, also faced notices for encroaching on farmland and govt land connected to Mohammad Ali Jauhar University and other properties, with these cases still under investigation. Adeeb has been questioned by the Enforcement Directorate in connection with a money laundering probe tied to his father's alleged illegal activities, but no formal charges have been reported against him. Both sons have remained involved in legal proceedings alongside their father over the years.The SP veteran's second imprisonment began in Oct 2023, when a Rampur court sentenced him, his wife, and son to seven years in the forged certificate case. While his family managed to secure his release in 2025, Khan remained in prison, facing fresh convictions and acquittals, including a 10-year sentence in a 2016 house eviction case, bail in theft charges and acquittal in a 2008 protest case. He was sentenced in six cases and has now been granted bail in all of them, though several other cases remain under trial.","Samajwadi Party (SP) national general secretary and former minister Azam Khan walked out of Sitapur jail on Tuesday after spending 23 months behind bars.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Police recorded statements of at least five individuals in connection with the murder of 85-year-old British national Pauline Crowther Ann, who was found dead at her residence on Jantar Mantar Lane on July 30.She was believed to have died in a fall in her room, but the autopsy report, released recently, suggested she was strangulated to death.Investigators plan to retrieve Ann's mobile phone, which was taken to the US by her daughter as a keepsake. ""The phone was taken before a murder case was registered,"" police sources explained. The cops have retrieved the phones of family members for forensic analysis.The statements of Ann's son, Daljit Sean Singh, and her daughter-in-law have been recorded.They told investigators there were no disputes or suspicious activities and that everything seemed normal in the days leading up to the incident. Both expressed deep distress at her death. TOI reached out to Singh, but received no response.The statement of the two drivers employed at the residence were also recorded and both claimed they were in the servants' quarters when Ann's body was discovered. A maid who exclusively cared for the octogenarian was also interviewed.She reportedly arrived at the house around 9am and left in the evening. Another domestic worker who is currently visiting her village in Uttar Pradesh has yet to be questioned.Police are seeking a second opinion from the medical board for greater clarity on forensic details, including the exact time and cause of death.Ann lived on the ground floor, while her son and his family occupied the upper floors. Ann was last seen alive around 9.30pm on July 29. Police sources said the residence's CCTV system retained footage for only 15 days and covered only the main gate area.Neighbours described the family as private and close-knit, noting the care Singh provided to his mother. ""She was very old and mostly in a wheelchair,"" one neighbour said. ""Whenever we saw her out, it was because Daljit was taking her somewhere. You could see the love and attention he gave her.""Ann did not permanently reside at the house, disclosed another neighbour. ""As far as we know, Ann was only visiting her son. Sometimes she stayed for a couple of months, other times longer-up to a year. Her visits were irregular,"" the neighbour said.Singh works professionally as an actor and model, while his wife manages an event management company. The couple has a daughter.Despite their affluence, the residence appears low-key, with no security guards though it has two CCTV cameras at the front and at the single gate serving as both entry and exit. In addition to their home, the family owns another property and maintains an office from where Singh manages his professional work.","Pauline Crowther Ann, 85, was found dead at her residence on Jantar Mantar Lane on July 30.

In a touching moment of history and humanity, King Charles III visited the world’s oldest living person, 116-year-old Ethel Caterham, at Hallmark Lakeview Care Home in Lightwater, Surrey. The meeting took place shortly after the King completed his official duties, including bidding farewell to US President Donald Trump at the end of his state visit and attending several high-level diplomatic events.Unlike formal royal ceremonies, this encounter was deeply personal and heartfelt. For the King, it was an opportunity to pay respect to a remarkable woman whose lifetime spans more than a century of world events and societal transformations, and for Mrs. Caterham, it was the fulfillment of a cherished wish she had expressed—to meet the monarch in person after celebrating her extraordinary milestone birthday.Ethel Caterham was born on 21 August 1909, in Shipton Bellinger, Hampshire, making her a witness to over 11 decades of world history. Her long life has seen humanity transition through wars, revolutions, pandemics, and technological transformations that reshaped the modern world, including the rise of aviation, space exploration, global communications, and major cultural shifts across continents.In April 2025, she officially became the world’s oldest living person following the death of Brazilian nun Sister Inah Canbarro Lucas, who was also 116 at the time of her passing. Beyond her age, what makes Mrs. Caterham’s life even more extraordinary is that she remains the last surviving subject of King Edward VII, connecting her directly to the Edwardian era and Britain’s early 20th-century monarchy, bridging history in a truly remarkable way.Throughout her 116 years, Ethel Caterham has lived through defining moments in global history. As a young child, she grew up in the aftermath of the Edwardian period, only to witness the First World War during her formative years. By the time she was 20, the world was in the grip of the Great Depression, and within a decade, she would see the devastation of the Second World War unfold.She also lived through monumental shifts such as the Russian Revolution, the decline of colonial empires, the rise of modern technology, and most recently, the Covid-19 pandemic. Few people alive today can claim to have seen the world transform in so many profound ways.As BBC reported, when King Charles III greeted Mrs. Caterham, the interaction was filled with warmth and wit. She reminisced about his 1969 investiture as the Prince of Wales, telling him: “I remember when your mother crowned you in Caernarfon Castle.”She went on to add with a smile that during his youth, “all the girls were in love with you and wanted to marry you.” The King responded with laughter and a humorous grimace, joking: “Yes well, all that’s left of him anyway.”This exchange highlighted not only Mrs. Caterham’s sharp memory but also her sense of humor, which continues to shine even after 116 years of life.Ethel Caterham’s personal life is as rich as her historical experiences. She was the second youngest of eight siblings and grew up in Tidworth, Wiltshire. At 18, she moved to India to work as an au pair for a military family, an adventure that shaped her independence at a time when international travel for women was rare.She returned to the UK at 21, where she met her future husband Norman at a dinner party in 1931. Together, they raised two daughters, building a family legacy that now includes three granddaughters and five great-grandchildren.Remarkably, she lived an active life well into her later years, even driving until the age of 97. For the past 50 years, she has made Surrey her permanent home, remaining close to her family.When Mrs. Caterham turned 115 in 2024, she received a personal congratulatory letter from King Charles, praising her for reaching a “truly remarkable milestone.” While her birthday celebration was kept quiet, she expressed that she would have gladly traded the occasion for a meeting with the King.This year, her wish came true. The King’s personal visit underscored the royal family’s long-standing tradition of honoring the nation’s oldest citizens. In the UK, it is customary for monarchs to send birthday greetings to those turning 100 or older, but in Mrs. Caterham’s case, the tribute went even further—a royal encounter in person.Supercentenarians, people who live beyond the age of 110, are extremely rare. There are fewer than 100 verified individuals alive worldwide who have reached this milestone, making Mrs. Caterham’s achievement extraordinary on a global scale. Longevity researchers study individuals like her to understand the genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors that contribute to such remarkable lifespans.In Ethel Caterham’s case, her resilience, sense of humor, and family support appear to be key contributors to her well-being. Her ability to drive until nearly 100 and remain mentally sharp well past her centenary suggests an active lifestyle played a role in her long life.","Ethel Caterham was born on 21 August 1909, in Shipton Bellinger, Hampshire.

Richard Sherman admitted to drinking before his traffic stop and failed sobriety tests

King County District Court Judge approves deferred prosecution for Richard Sherman

Richard Sherman receives no special treatment under state law

The former NFL cornerback turned sports analyst Richard Sherman has been given a deferred prosecution in his DUI case from 2024 by a judge in the King County District Court in Washington. This means Sherman can avoid a criminal trial by completing a two-year treatment program and sticking to strict conditions for five years of probation.On February 24, 2024, at around 2 a.m., a Washington State Patrol officer pulled over Richard Sherman on Interstate 405 for speeding at 79 mph in a 60 mph zone. The officer saw Sherman's vehicle swerving or 'bouncing back and forth' within its lane.Sherman, who was 37 at the time, had bloodshot eyes and confessed to drinking two margaritas earlier that evening. He refused a voluntary Breathalyzer test but took part in field sobriety tests, which he failed, resulting in his arrest.Approximately two hours later, after securing a warrant, authorities carried out a blood test that indicated a blood-alcohol level of about 0.11, which is over Washington's legal limit of 0.08. The Washington State Patrol crime lab confirmed these results.September 23, 2025 King County District Court Judge Peter J.Peaquin signed the deferred prosecution holding the DUI charge pending, provided that Sherman satisfies the goals of the court.Under the legislation of Washington State, a person seeking deferred prosecution must confirm that their conduct was associated with a substance use disorder or a mental health issue and will have a two-year treatment room.Sherman needs to steer clear of alcohol, nonprescription drugs, and marijuana throughout this time. The entire program lasts five years, which includes probation, and the arrest will be considered a prior offense in any upcoming DUI cases. If Sherman follows all the rules, the charges will be dropped; if not, he could end up facing a bench or jury trial to figure out if he's guilty.A representative from the King County Prosecuting Attorney's Office confirmed the decision to ESPN, mentioning that the state doesn't have a say in approving these requests since it adheres to state law without any special treatment.Sherman's attorney, Jon Fox, provided a statement to TMZ Sports on September 23, 2025, explaining the decision, ""The deferred prosecution represents Mr. Sherman's commitment to working past any issues with alcohol or other issues that could have led to this incident.

Stephen A. Smith questioned Jimmy Kimmel’s joke after Charlie Kirk’s death

“The only thing that I would say as it pertains to Jimmy Kimmel is, where was the joke? Because you’re a late-night host, and obviously that has a comedic attachment to it.

Where was the joke? Obviously, it wasn’t anything funny about that.”

“MAGA gang”

Keith Olbermann defended Jimmy Kimmel and attacked Stephen A. Smith

“Just adding to what has been true for years: @stephenasmith is a f***ing idiot.

And now he smells money prostituting himself to, and collaborating with, the right wing.”

“nothing [Kimmel] said was untrue.”

Keith Olbermann, the former ESPN and MSNBC host, has turned his anger toward Stephen A. Smith. On Thursday, September 19, 2025, Olbermann posted on X that Smith had “prostituted himself to the right wing. ” This came after Smith questioned Jimmy Kimmel ’s joke about conservative activist Charlie Kirk , who was shot and killed last week while speaking at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. Olbermann, who once anchored SportsCenter, also called Smith an “idiot” for his remarks about Kimmel.Stephen A. Smith spoke about the issue on his SiriusXM show Straight Shooter on Wednesday. He said,Jimmy Kimmel had suggested that thewas trying to use Kirk’s killing for political gain. The comment led ABC, owned by Disney, to suspend Kimmel from his late-night program. Smith said he respected Kimmel as a host but felt this remark was not the right time for humor.Keith Olbermann fired back at Stephen A. Smith’s comments in a post on X. He wrote:Keith Olbermann has already faced criticism this week for telling broadcast group Sinclair to “burn in hell” in a message that included Charlie Kirk’s name.

LUCKNOW: Chaos erupted at the Basic Shiksha Adhikari (BSA) office in Sitapur on Tuesday evening after a headmaster allegedly attacked BSA Akhilesh Pratap Singh with a belt during an argument over complaints filed against him. A 33-second video of the incident also went viral on social media.The accused, identified as Brijendra Kumar Verma, headmaster of a primary school in Nadwa Visheshwarganj, Mahmudabad block, arrived at the BSA office to present his clarification regarding complaints lodged by a woman teacher. According to eyewitnesses, BSA Singh was dissatisfied with Verma’s explanation, which led to a heated exchange.In a sudden outburst, Verma allegedly slammed a file on the BSA’s desk, pulled out his belt, and struck Singh multiple times. Within six seconds, the officer was hit at least five times. When Singh tried to call the police, the headmaster reportedly snatched his mobile phone and smashed it.

‘For hiding Epstein & ...’: Sacramento ABC shooting accused left notes targeting Trump aides; political motive suspected,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/for-hiding-epstein-sacramento-abc-shooting-accused-left-notes-targeting-trump-aides-political-motive-suspected/articleshow/124081547.cms,"Representative image





A man accused of firing bullets into the Sacramento ABC affiliate’s offices last week had handwritten notes in his car that threatened members of the Trump administration, according to federal officials.Anibal Hernandez Santana, 64, is charged with multiple firearms offences and interference with a federally licensed radio or communications station after the Sept. 19 incident at ABC10 in California’s capital.No one was injured, but employees had to shelter in place and halt operations temporarily.Authorities said that after Hernandez Santana posted bail on Saturday, police searched his car and found a note reading, “For hiding Epstein & ignoring red flags. Do not support Patel, Bongino, & AG Pam Bondi. They’re next. – CK from above”, as per Fox News.Prosecutors said the reference to “CK” appeared to be a nod to conservative activist Charlie Kirk , recently killed by a sniper in Utah. Police also discovered a book titled “The Cult of Trump” in his vehicle.According to news agency AP, Hernandez Santana was initially booked on state charges, including shooting into an occupied building, assault with a deadly weapon and negligent discharge of a firearm.He faces federal charges for discharging a firearm within a school zone and interfering with a communications station, which carry up to five years in prison.District Attorney Thien Ho also noted that under the date of the shooting, the suspect had written in a planner, “Do the Next Scary Thing”.Hernandez Santana, a retired lobbyist born in Puerto Rico, was not registered with any political party, according to state voting records. Ho said the attack appeared politically motivated, citing both the notes and the context of recent national events, including protests at the station over late-night host Jimmy Kimmel’s suspension and remarks about Charlie Kirk.Acting US Attorney Bill Essayli criticised Hernandez Santana’s initial release on bail, posting on X, “Welcome to California, where someone can commit attempted murder and be back on the streets the same day”.Meanwhile, Hernandez Santana’s lawyer Mark Reichel described the case as “highly unusual” and emphasised his client’s right to due process, stating, “He is innocent unless and until he is found otherwise”.FBI Director Kash Patel also condemned the attack on X and wrote, “Targeted acts of violence are unacceptable and will be pursued to the fullest extent of the law”.Authorities said Hernandez Santana fired four times at the ABC station — once near the building and three times at the lobby window.Sacramento police said the station was clearly not a random target and prosecutors plan to seek to hold him without bail in federal court.","Anibal Hernandez Santana, 64, is charged with multiple firearms offences and interference with a federally licensed radio or communications station.

"Reversal move: After layoffs and cuts, Trump admin brings back hundreds – Here’s why",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/reversal-move-after-layoffs-and-cuts-trump-admin-brings-back-hundreds-heres-why/articleshow/124081189.cms,"



Hundreds of federal employees who were dismissed during Elon Musk’s cost-cutting campaign are being asked to return to work, with the General Services Administration (GSA) issuing recall notices that give them until the end of the week to accept or decline. Those who agree will resume duty on October 6 after what has amounted to a seven-month paid absence, according to an internal memo reviewed by the Associated Press.“Ultimately, the outcome was the agency was left broken and understaffed,” said Chad Becker, a former GSA real estate official. “They didn’t have the people they needed to carry out basic functions.”The reversal highlights the strain on the GSA, which manages thousands of federal workplaces and was a prime target of Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Agencies including the IRS, Labor Department and National Park Service have also reinstated staff in recent weeks after downsizing moves proved disruptive.Starting in March, thousands of GSA employees resigned or took early retirement offers. Hundreds more were dismissed outright as part of aggressive staff reductions, yet some continued to draw salaries. While the agency has not disclosed the cost of its reversal, Democrats argue the downsizing yielded no tangible savings.Rep. Greg Stanton of Arizona, the top Democrat overseeing the GSA, said: “It’s created costly confusion while undermining the very services taxpayers depend on.”DOGE had identified GSA as a central focus of its campaign against waste and fraud. Musk’s aides embedded at GSA headquarters sought to cancel nearly half of the agency’s 7,500 leases and sell hundreds of federally owned buildings. At one stage, more than 800 lease termination notices were issued without informing government tenants.Although DOGE initially claimed the cancellations would save nearly $460 million, estimates have since been reduced to $140 million. More than 480 leases previously marked for termination have been spared, covering properties used by the IRS, Social Security Administration and FDA.Job cuts were similarly severe, with headquarters staff reduced by 79% and facilities managers by 35%, according to a federal official. The disruption left 131 leases to expire without agencies vacating properties, exposing taxpayers to heavy fees as landlords were unable to re-let the space.GSA representatives declined to answer questions on staffing or costs, but a spokesman said in an email: “GSA’s leadership team has reviewed workforce actions and is making adjustments in the best interest of the customer agencies we serve and the American taxpayers.”The Government Accountability Office is currently reviewing GSA’s management of workforce reductions, lease cancellations and building sales, with findings expected in the coming months, said senior GAO official David Marroni.","General Services Administration (GSA) issued recall notices that give them until the end of the week to accept or decline.

No ‘luxury goods’ purchase: Trump administration bars Iranian diplomats from shopping; Iran condemns move,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-luxury-goods-purchase-trump-administration-bars-iranian-diplomats-from-shopping-iran-condemns-move/articleshow/124081130.cms,"



Iranian diplomats and officials visiting the United States will no longer be allowed to shop at Costco or other wholesale retailers without prior approval from the State Department, according to new restrictions published in the Federal Register this week. The rules, which also apply to accompanying family members, prohibit the purchase of “luxury goods” without US clearance.The announcement came as world leaders gathered in New York for the annual United Nations General Assembly. Wholesale chains like Costco, Sam’s Club and BJ’s Wholesale Club were specifically listed under the new curbs. For years, visiting Iranian officials have been photographed loading up goods -- including televisions and cereal boxes -- during UN trips, images that circulated widely in Iran.“These measures are aimed at exploiting sensitivities in Iranian public opinion,” said Omid Memarian, an Iran expert at DAWN, a Washington-based research group. “For years, many Iranians have been dissatisfied — and even angry — that large delegations travel with presidents to New York, imposing significant costs on the nation in the midst of sanctions and economic austerity.”Iran criticised the move, calling it inappropriate for the host nation of the UNGA.Foreign ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei said the measures “were unprecedented” and contravened Washington’s obligations as a host.Analysts said the shopping ban was more symbolic than practical. “It is primarily aimed at deepening the wedge between the Iranian state and society,” said Ali Vaez, Iran project director at the International Crisis Group. He added that the step could also appear “petty” for “the superpower who hosts the UN to try to regulate the shopping of its international guests.”Iranian diplomats have long faced some of the toughest restrictions in the United States. In 2019, the Trump administration confined their movements to a narrow radius around Manhattan’s UN complex, forbidding travel beyond Kennedy Airport, the Iranian mission, or the ambassador’s residence. Former foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif was even barred from visiting a New York hospital where the Iranian ambassador was receiving treatment.The US has imposed similar curbs on other nations. Russian diplomats require approval to travel outside designated areas, while Chinese diplomats since 2019 must notify the State Department of any meetings held in the US.",Iranian diplomats and officials visiting the United States will no longer be allowed to shop at Costco or other wholesale retailers without prior approval from the State Department.

"Drone attack in Haiti slum kills 8 children: Residents blame police for strike; UN-backed mission still short on manpower, funding",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/drone-attack-in-haiti-slum-kills-8-children-residents-blame-police-for-strike-un-backed-mission-still-short-on-manpower-funding/articleshow/124059212.cms,"



A drone attack targeting a suspected gang leader killed at least eight children and injured six others in Cité Soleil, a gang-controlled slum of Haiti’s capital, relatives and activists told The Associated Press on Monday. They blamed police for launching the strike on Saturday night.The explosions struck during a gathering reportedly organised by suspected gang leader Albert Steevenson, known as Djouma, who was preparing to celebrate his birthday. Haiti’s National Human Rights Defense Network said Steevenson was distributing gifts to children at the time.“This is my daughter,” said Claudia Bobrun, 30, showing AP a video of her 8-year-old girl lying in a pool of blood. Tears rolled down her face as she replayed the clip.Residents said at least 13 people died, including civilians and suspected gang members. Victims included the two grandchildren and son of 60-year-old Michelis Florville. “People were running right and left,” he recalled.Nanouse Mertelia, 37, said her son was killed after being caught in the blast. “Come get me, come get me, please mama,” she quoted him as saying before he died from blood loss.The rights group accused police of using two kamikaze drones in the Simon Pelé community of Cité Soleil. Activists added that a similar drone operation in downtown Port-au-Prince earlier this month killed at least eleven civilians.“However, the drones have not targeted terrorist leaders. On the contrary, these leaders have grown more at ease and increasingly arrogant, even moving openly in convoys. Drones must not be selective, and they must also ensure the protection of civilians to avoid collateral damage,” the group said.The attack follows the creation of a new task force earlier this year that operates outside Haiti’s police oversight, relying on certain units and private contractors using explosive drones.It comes as private security firm Vectus Global, linked to former US Navy Seal Erik Prince, prepares to deploy nearly 200 foreign personnel to Haiti under a one-year contract. The government has confirmed it is working with foreign contractors but has not disclosed the terms of the deal.Meanwhile, the UN-backed multinational mission in Haiti continues to face resource shortages, with just 991 personnel deployed against a target of 2,500, and funding standing at $112 million of the $800 million required annually, according to a recent UN report.","The explosions struck during a gathering reportedly organised by suspected gang leader Albert Steevenson, known as Djouma.

Former Vice President Kamala Harris on Monday expressed her support for Zohran Mamdani in New York City’s mayoral race, making her the most prominent Democratic figure to publicly back the democratic socialist candidate.“Look, as far as I’m concerned, he’s the Democratic nominee, and he should be supported,” Harris told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow during an interview promoting her new book, 107 Days.Asked directly whether she was endorsing Mamdani, Harris replied, “I support the Democrat in the race, sure,” without mentioning the candidate by name. She added that Mamdani was “not the only star” running for mayor, highlighting candidates like Barbara Drummond in Mobile, Alabama, and Helena Moreno in New Orleans. “I hope that we don’t so over-index on New York City that we lose sight of the stars throughout our country. So that’s where I am — we’ve got a big tent and we’ve got a lot of stars.”Harris’ comments mark her first major television interview since losing the 2024 presidential election to Donald Trump. Her remarks also come amid caution from other top Democrats. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and New York State Democratic Party Chair Jay Jacobs have withheld endorsement of Mamdani, while New York Governor Kathy Hochul has publicly supported him.Mamdani, a state Assembly member, has received backing from progressive leaders including Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. Some moderate Democrats, however, have voiced concerns that Mamdani’s democratic socialist positions could be used by Republicans to portray the party as too far left ahead of next year’s midterm elections.","Former Vice President Kamala Harris expressed her support for Zohran Mamdani in New York City’s mayoral race, making her the most prominent Democratic figure to publicly back the democratic socialist candidate.

Trump’s push for retribution



A loyalist at the centre







US President Donald Trump has announced that Lindsey Halligan, a lawyer who has long been part of his inner legal circle, will be his nominee for US attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia. The appointment came after the sudden removal of Erik Siebert, the previous prosecutor, who resisted pressure to bring criminal charges against Trump’s political adversaries.Trump made the announcement on Truth Social, praising Attorney General Pam Bondi while urging her to act more aggressively. “Pam Bondi is doing a GREAT job as attorney general of the United States. She is very careful, very smart, loves our country, but needs a tough prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia, like my recommendation, Lindsey Halligan, to get things moving,” he wrote.Halligan, a lawyer and former beauty queen, was one of Trump’s legal defenders after the FBI raided his Mar-a-Lago estate in search of classified documents. More recently, she has worked inside the White House reviewing Smithsonian programmes that the administration claims promote “improper ideology.”Trump has made no secret of his desire to use federal prosecutors against opponents, including New York attorney general Letitia James and former FBI director James Comey.“They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW,” Trump posted.Siebert resigned last week after refusing to press charges against James, saying the evidence was insufficient. Trump disputed this, declaring: “I fired him, and there is a GREAT CASE, and many lawyers, and legal pundits, say so.”Halligan’s selection underscores Trump’s preference for personal loyalty in key legal posts. In his announcement, he called her “Fair, Smart, and \[someone who] will provide, desperately needed, JUSTICE FOR ALL!”Her elevation surprised many in Washington, especially after another conservative lawyer, Mary “Maggie” Cleary, told colleagues she had been tapped for the role only hours earlier.Whether Halligan serves in an interim capacity or proceeds to a Senate confirmation remains unclear. What is certain is that Trump has chosen a trusted aide with a record of defending him in high-profile legal battles to take on one of the most politically charged prosecutorial roles in the country.","Lindsey Halligan, a lawyer who has long been part of Trump's inner legal circle, will be his nominee for US attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia.

Starbucks REACTS On Viral ‘Loser’ Kirk Tribute Cup: Company Says CCTV Footage Says SOMETHING ELSE





An Ohio woman was left shocked after ordering Charlie Kirk’s favourite Starbucks drink and finding a derogatory message written on the cup.Autumn Perkins, of Middletown, Ohio, had visited a Starbucks inside a Kroger store and requested a Mint Majesty with two honeys. When she received her order, an employee had written “racist’s fav drink” on the side of the cup, reported Fox News.“It’s time for people to stop this nonsense,” Perkins was quoted as saying by Fox News Digital.After reporting the incident to the store manager, she learned that the employee admitted to writing the message and was subsequently fired. Perkins said, “I would agree that people should be fired if they're doing something like this. Actions have repercussions. I feel like Charlie stood for respect — we don't have to agree on everything. We can disagree on a lot of things, but we respect each other. We can't communicate and grow if we're disrespecting each other”.Starbucks clarified that writing negative or offensive messages on cups violates company policy.A spokesperson said, “Writing this on a cup is unacceptable, and we have clear policies that prohibit negative messages to help preserve a welcoming environment.This Starbucks location is licensed and operated by Kroger. We understand that this associate was terminated by Kroger”.Kroger confirmed the firing, adding, “This behavior does not reflect Kroger’s values”.The incident comes amid nationwide attention on Charlie Kirk, the Turning Point USA founder who was fatally shot on September 10 while speaking at Utah Valley University. His death has drawn tributes from US President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance, FBI chief Kash Patel and widespread public mourning.Perkins said she would no longer patronise Starbucks following the incident, adding: “I don't intend to spend another penny at Starbucks — and as far as I'm concerned, neither will my children or anybody else in my family who will listen to me”.The episode also echoes a separate incident in California, where a Starbucks barista initially refused to write Charlie Kirk’s name on a cup, citing company policy against political content.Starbucks later clarified that actual names, including Charlie Kirk, are allowed, distinguishing them from political slogans or offensive phrases.","Autumn Perkins, of Middletown, Ohio, had visited a Starbucks inside a Kroger store and requested a Mint Majesty with two honeys.

Elon Musk’s Father Under FIRE: Child Abuse Allegations Erupt, Errol DEFENDS Himself With BOLD Claim





Errol Musk, 79, the father of tech billionaire Elon Musk, has been accused of sexually abusing five of his children and stepchildren since 1993, according to a report published by The New York Times on Tuesday.Based on personal letters, emails, and interviews with family members, The New York Times reported that Errol Musk, who has at least nine children and stepchildren and has been married three times, holds considerable influence over most of the family members.Based on court records, personal correspondence, social worker reports, and family interviews, the earliest allegation against Errol Musk dates back to 1993, when his four-year-old stepdaughter reported inappropriate touching. A decade later, she accused him of further misconduct, and additional claims have been made by two daughters and a stepson.The outlet noted that three separate law enforcement investigations were launched; two were closed without action, while the outcome of the third remains unclear, as per NYT.Errol Musk rejected the allegations reported by The New York Times as “false.”“There was no evidence because this is nonsense,” he said, accusing family members of coaching the children to make false claims and attempting to extort his eldest son, Elon.Elon Musk and his personal attorney did not respond to requests for comment.In a 2017 interview with Rolling Stone, Musk said his father had done “almost every evil thing you could possibly think of.”“My dad will have a carefully thought-out plan of evil. He will plan evil,” Musk said to the publication.In a 2023 authorized biography by Walter Isaacson, he stated that he no longer communicates with Errol Musk, as per The Guardian.Born and raised in Pretoria, South Africa’s administrative capital, Errol Musk rose to prominence as a businessman in his 20s and 30s, including serving as a partner in an engineering firm and briefly as a member of the Pretoria City Council.In 1970, he married dietitian and model Maye Haldeman, and the couple had three children, Elon Musk, Tosca Musk, now a streaming service executive for romance films, and Kimbal Musk, who became an entrepreneur.The couple divorced in 1979.

‘Surrender to ransom demands’: Donald Trump condemns recognition of Palestinian state by West; warns it 'rewards Hamas',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/surrender-to-ransom-demands-donald-trump-condemns-recognition-of-palestinian-state-by-west-warns-it-rewards-hamas/articleshow/124078425.cms,"Donald Trump (AP)





US President Donald Trump on Tuesday criticized Western nations for recognizing a Palestinian state, arguing the move would reward what he called “horrible atrocities” committed by Hamas.""As if to encourage continued conflict, some of this body is seeking to unilaterally recognize the Palestinian state. The rewards would be too great for Hamas terrorists for their atrocities,"" Trump said in a speech at the UN.Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Trump condemned the recent recognitions of Palestinian statehood, calling them a surrender to Hamas’s “ransom demands.”He argued such moves reward the militant group, fuel further conflict, and distract from what he said should be the priority, securing the release of hostages still held in Gaza nearly two years after Hamas attacked Israel.""Instead of giving in to Hamas' ransom demands, those who want peace should be united with one message - release the hostages now, just release the hostages,"" Trump said.In the past two days, France, Britain, Canada, Australia, and Portugal have all formally recognized a Palestinian state.The Palestine Liberation Organization proclaimed an independent Palestinian state in 1988, gaining swift recognition from much of the Global South.Today, nearly 150 of the 193 UN member states acknowledge Palestinian statehood, as reported by Reuters.On Gaza, Trump said he has been “deeply engaged” in efforts to broker a hostage-ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, but accused the group of obstructing progress toward ending the war.“Unfortunately, Hamas has repeatedly rejected reasonable offers to make peace,” Trump said. “We can’t forget October 7, can we?”Trump was scheduled to meet on Tuesday with leaders and officials from several Muslim-majority nations, including Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Egypt, Jordan, Turkey, Indonesia, and Pakistan, to discuss the escalating crisis in the besieged Gaza Strip.Alongside efforts to secure hostage releases and end the conflict, Trump is also expected to outline US proposals for an Israeli withdrawal and post-war governance in Gaza that excludes Hamas, as cited by Axios.According to the Gaza Health Ministry, the war has left at least 65,382 Palestinians dead. Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 others during the October 7 attack. Most of those taken hostage have since been freed through ceasefires or negotiated agreements, as per AP.","US President Donald Trump criticized Western nations for recognizing a Palestinian state, arguing the move would reward what he called ""horrible atrocities"" committed by Hamas.

Trump supports Nato on shooting down Russian jets violating their airspace





US President Donald Trump on Tuesday gave strong remarks on the ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict, claiming that Ukraine, with European Union and NATO support, could potentially reclaim all of its territory.Trump, in a post on his social media platform Truth Social, slammed Russia’s war effort as “aimless” and described the country as a “paper tiger,” highlighting the severe economic strain on Moscow and major Russian cities caused by the conflict. He noted the difficulty Russians are facing in everyday life, including “the fact that it’s almost impossible for them to get gasoline through the long lines that are being formed,” as well as other challenges impacting Russia’s war economy, which is spending most of its resources on fighting Ukraine.“Ukraine, with time, patience, and the financial support of Europe and, in particular, NATO, the original borders from where this war started is very much an option,” Trump wrote. He emphasized that the country’s people have “great spirit, and only getting better,” and suggested that Ukraine could potentially even go beyond reclaiming its pre-war territory.Trump also addressed the US role in the conflict, stating that the country will continue supplying weapons to NATO “for NATO to do what they want with them.”He concluded by noting, “Putin and Russia are in BIG Economic trouble, and this is the time for Ukraine to act.”This marks a pivot from Trump's earlier statements, in which he primarily focused on brokering peace between the two nations in conflict since 2022.In an another development against Russia, Trump said that he agrees with Nato shooting down Russian jets violating their airspaces. When asked by a reporter whether NATO countries should shoot down Russian aircraft that violate their airspace, Trump replied, “Yes, I do.”However, he stopped short of committing the United States to taking such action. “Depends on the circumstance,” Trump said, as cited by CNN. “But you know, we’re very strong toward NATO.”Trump also sidestepped questions on whether Russian President Vladimir Putin is ready for peace despite recent escalations.Read more: Donald Trump supports Nato shooting down Russian jets violating airspace; stops short of committing US forces","US President Donald Trump on Tuesday gave strong remarks on the ongoing Ukraine- Russia conflict.

Florida assassination attempt: Ryan Routh found guilty of attempting to kill Donald Trump; US President hails 'meticulously handled' trial,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-florida-assassination-case-ryan-routh-found-guilty-of-attempting-to-kill-us-president-represented-himself-at-trial/articleshow/124077619.cms,"This courtroom sketch shows U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon listening to Ryan Routh during his trial (AP photo)





A jury on Tuesday found Ryan Routh guilty of attempting to assassinate US President Donald Trump at his Florida golf club last year. After two hours of deliberation, the 12-member jury — five men and seven women — delivered a unanimous verdict on all charges, as reported by Associated Press.Routh, 59, faced multiple federal counts, including attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate, unlawful firearm possession during a violent crime, assault on a federal officer, possession of a firearm as a convicted felon, and possession of a weapon with removed serial numbers. He conducted his own defence throughout the trial, maintaining his innocence.Prosecutors said Routh had meticulously planned the attack for weeks before positioning himself with a rifle in the bushes as Trump played golf on September 15, 2024, at his West Palm Beach club.During his closing statement, Routh argued against criminal intent, saying: “It's hard for me to believe that a crime occurred if the trigger was never pulled.” He added that he had a clear view of Trump on the sixth-hole green and highlighted that he did not shoot at a Secret Service agent who approached him.Routh chose not to testify and presented only three witnesses — a firearms specialist and two character references — over three hours.In contrast, the prosecution presented 38 witnesses over seven days.Soon after the verdict, Trump took too social media hailing the verdict and his aides for 'meticulously handling the trial' along with the judiciary. ""Congratulations to Attorney General Pam Bondi, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, and the entire DOJ team on the conviction, in Florida, of the person who attempted an assassination on my life. The trial was meticulously handled, and I would like to thank the Judge and Jury for their time, professionalism, and patience,"" he said.""This was an evil man with an evil intention, and they caught him. I would also like to thank the Secret Service, Department of Florida Law Enforcement, and the wonderful person who spotted him running from the site of the crime, and acted by following him, and getting all information on car type and license plate to the Sheriff’s Office, IMMEDIATELY, which led to his arrest and conviction. What incredible instinct and foresight this person had — A very big moment for JUSTICE IN AMERICA!"" Trump added.Attorney General Pam Bondi lauded the ruling on X, stating: “This illustrates the Department of Justice's commitment to punishing those who engage in political violence.”Judge Aileen Cannon had approved Routh’s self-representation following July hearings, while his previous lawyers served as standby counsel during the two-week trial.A Secret Service agent testified that he intercepted Routh before Trump appeared. Routh aimed his weapon at the agent, who fired first, causing him to drop the rifle and flee without firing at the former president. A witness later helped authorities identify and locate Routh, who was arrested near the interstate after fleeing the scene.The shooting incident came just nine weeks after another assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, where Trump survived a bullet grazing his ear, and the assailant was killed by the Secret Service.Meanwhile, Routh, originally from North Carolina and later living in Hawaii, had a history of involvement in international conflicts and previous legal issues. He had attempted to recruit fighters for Ukraine against Russia and faced earlier arrests in Greensboro, North Carolina, for weapons-related incidents.Alongside the federal charges, Routh faces additional state charges of terrorism and attempted murder, to which he has pleaded not guilty.","Ryan Routh, 59, faced multiple federal counts, including attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate, unlawful firearm possession during a violent crime, assault on a federal officer, and possession of a firearm as a convicted felon.
