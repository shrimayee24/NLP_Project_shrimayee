Supreme Court: How is ‘Jai Shri Ram’ slogan in mosque a crime?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-how-is-jai-shri-ram-slogan-in-mosque-a-crime/articleshow/116379160.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday asked a caretaker to explain how shouting ‘Jai Shri Ram' inside the mosque outraged the religious feelings of his community and became an offence. It, however, sought Karnataka govt's stand on his appeal against quashing of criminal proceedings against the two accused.Appearing for the petitioner, caretaker Haydhar Ali, senior advocate Devadatt Kamat told the bench that shouting such slogans inside a mosque would amount to an attempt to stir communal strife and becomes an offence when accompanied by threat to lives of Muslims.When Kamat, with advocate Javedur Rehman, argued that the HC should have allowed police to complete the probe and not stayed investigations within 20 days of registration of FIR, the bench of Justices Pankaj Mithal and Sandeep Mehta asked, ""Alright, they were shouting a particular religious slogan. How is that an offence?""Kamat said if persons from one faith shouted religious slogans inside the place of worship of another faith, it surely would be an offence. The bench said the FIR was registered based on CCTV footage that detected two persons moving around the mosque.""What is the evidence apart from the CCTV footage to link the two to the incident,"" the bench asked. Kamat said it was for the police to find out who were the persons responsible for disturbing communal harmony and threatening the Muslim community. The bench asked Rehman to serve the petition on the standing counsel for Karnataka to ascertain the state's stand on the appeal by Ali challenging the HC decision.The HC, on Sept 13, had quashed criminal proceedings before a Puttur court in Dakshina Kannada district, saying the FIR did not disclose ingredients of any offence. It was alleged that on Sept 24, 2023, some miscreants entered Badriya Juma Masjid at Aithoor Village, started shouting ‘Jai Shri Ram', and followed with threats that Muslims would not be allowed to live in peace. Ali had lodged a complaint with the police, leading to the arrest of the two.","Supreme Court asks caretaker to explain how shouting ‘Jai Shri Ram’ inside the mosque outraged the religious feelings of his community.

Cyclone Chido batters France's Mayotte; casualties could number in thousands,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/cyclone-chido-batters-frances-mayotte-casualties-could-number-in-thousands/articleshow/116350238.cms,"Rescue workers attempt to clear a blocked road, in the aftermath of Cyclone Chido (Reuters photo)

A powerful cyclone struck the French Indian Ocean archipelago of Mayotte , potentially causing a massive loss of life. On Monday morning, authorities reported that the official death toll stood at 14, but according to a senior local French official, the final death toll could be in the hundreds or even thousands.Prefect François-Xavier Bieuville told broadcaster Mayotte la Première, “I think there will definitely be several hundred, perhaps we will come close to a thousand or even several thousand” deaths. He added that confirming the final toll will be challenging due to Muslim burial customs and the presence of undocumented residents.Determining accurate figures is further complicated by an estimated 100,000 undocumented residents, according to France's Interior Ministry. Bieuville noted the difficulty in counting all the casualties, highlighting the destruction in Mayotte’s slums of metal shacks and informal structures.Former nurse Ousseni Balahachi reported that some individuals avoided seeking help, fearing deportation, and many remained in place until escape became impossible.French authorities reported that entire neighborhoods have been flattened, while public infrastructure, including the main airport and hospital, suffered severe damage.The airport control tower is non-functional, limiting access to military aircraft only, which has complicated rescue efforts. The cyclone's impact has also left Mayotte, France’s poorest department, without electricity, further hindering relief operations.Rescue operations are underway, with French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau arriving in the capital, Mamoudzou, on Monday morning. France is sending additional soldiers, firefighters, and medical personnel to Mayotte, with over 800 personnel expected in the coming days. Supplies, including medical equipment and blood for transfusions, are being delivered from Reunion Island by ship and military aircraft.The devastating cyclone has severely disrupted healthcare facilities across Mayotte. Health Minister Geneviève Darrieussecq stated on France 2 that ""the hospital has suffered major water damage and destruction, notably in the surgical, intensive care, maternity, and emergency units."" Medical centres were also rendered non-operational.As per AFP, Mamoudzou Mayor Ambdilwahedou Soumaila stated that nine people were in critical condition and 246 others were seriously injured, describing the situation as devastating. ""Honestly, what we are experiencing is a tragedy. You feel like you are in the aftermath of a nuclear war… I saw an entire neighborhood disappear,"" said Mohamed Ishmael to Reuters, a resident of Mamoudzou.Cyclone Chido , classified as a Category 4 storm with winds exceeding 220 kph (136 mph), is the strongest to hit the region in nearly a century. It also struck the Comoros Islands, causing minor damage, before making landfall in Mozambique on Sunday.Mozambique authorities and aid agencies have reported that over two million people might be affected, with three deaths confirmed so far. The remnants of the storm are expected to bring heavy rain to Malawi, Zimbabwe, and Zambia, raising concerns about potential flooding.EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen offered support on Sunday, posting on X, “Our hearts go out to France following the devastating passage of Cyclone Chido through Mayotte. We are ready to provide support in the days to come.”WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus expressed readiness to assist, stating on X that his organization ""stands ready to support communities in need of essential health care."" PIROI, the regional Red Cross organization, also indicated its preparedness to help.Authorities had ordered Mayotte’s 300,000 residents into lockdown as the cyclone approached. The storm caused widespread destruction, particularly in shantytowns housing a significant portion of the population, including many undocumented residents.UNICEF is also providing assistance in Mozambique, where health facilities are already limited. The UN has warned that 1.7 million people in the region face risk from flooding as the cyclone continues its path inland.Experts link Cyclone Chido’s intensity to climate change, with meteorologist François Gourand noting that unusually warm Indian Ocean temperatures contributed to its strength.December through March is cyclone season in the southwestern Indian Ocean, and the region has experienced several devastating storms in recent years, including Cyclone Idai in 2019 and Cyclone Freddy in 2023.","Cyclone Chido struck the French Indian Ocean archipelago of Mayotte on Sunday, potentially causing a massive loss of life.

The strikes targeted military sites, including air defence units and surface-to-surface missile warehouses, causing several large explosions that were captured on video.The Observatory reported that the strikes devastated the base of the 23rd Air Defence Brigade and nearby facilities used to store advanced weaponry. ""The heaviest strikes in Syria's coastal region since the start of strikes in 2012,"" it said.Israel has long conducted airstrikes in Syria to prevent advanced weaponry from reaching hostile groups such as Hezbollah. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that the strikes aim to thwart security threats and maintain stability along Israel’s northern border. ""We have no interest in a conflict with Syria,"" he said, adding that Israel's action were aimed to ""thwart the potential threats from Syria and to prevent the takeover of terrorist elements near our border"".According to independent researcher, Richard Cordaro the explosion was so big that it registered on the richter scale.""The explosion of the ammunition depot at Tartus , Syria was detected at Iznik, Türkiye magnetometer station 820 km away,"" he said in a post on X.Defence minister Israel Katz echoed Netanyahu’s sentiments, describing Syria’s evolving situation as a heightened risk to Israel's security despite the moderate tone of new Syrian leadership. Ahmad al-Sharaa, the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and Syria's de facto ruler after President Bashar al-Assad was ousted, criticised the strikes, calling them ""unprovoked aggression."" However, he stressed that Syria was focused on reconstruction and avoiding further military confrontations.Since its civil war began in 2011, Syria has remained a battleground for various factions, with over 500,000 killed and millions displaced. Israel's recent actions highlight the ongoing volatility in the region, despite the apparent shift in Syrian leadership.Israel’s strikes also intersect with its broader strategy to solidify control over the Golan Heights, a region it captured during the 1967 Six-Day War and annexed in 1981. Netanyahu’s government recently approved a $11 million plan to double the Israeli population in the Golan, a move condemned by Arab nations, including Saudi Arabia and the UAE.","Israel launched a series of airstrikes in Syria's coastal Tartus region late Sunday, marking the most intense bombardment in the area since 2012.

'Some are stars mistaken as drones': US Homeland Security on mysterious sightings,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/some-are-stars-mistaken-as-drones-us-homeland-security-on-mysterious-sightings/articleshow/116385762.cms,"Recent drone sighting in US

Drones and a mysterious winged aircraft were captured flying over NJ. The FBI is now investigating.

Joint statement on drone sightings:



The FBI has received over 5,000 reports of drone sightings in recent weeks, generating approximately 100 investigative leads.

Federal agencies are assisting state and local authorities in investigating these reports.

Advanced detection technology and trained visual observers have been deployed to affected areas.

Initial analysis indicates sightings include a mix of lawful drones (commercial, hobbyist, and law enforcement), manned aircraft, and natural phenomena like stars.

No evidence of anomalous activity has been found.

These sightings do not pose a national security or public safety threat, particularly in civilian airspace over New Jersey or other northeastern states.

Authorities acknowledge public concern and continue to collaborate with local agencies using advanced detection technology.

Limited drone sightings have occurred near military installations, including restricted airspace in New Jersey and other locations.

Such sightings are not new, and the DoD treats unauthorised access seriously, coordinating detection and mitigation efforts with relevant authorities.

The US department of homeland security (DHS), in a joint statement with the FBI, federal aviation administration (FAA), and department of defense (DoD), has addressed recent concerns about drone sightings in a joint statement released on Tuesday. The statement clarified the nature of the sightings, ongoing investigations, and steps being taken to ensure public safety and security.While most reports involve legitimate drone activity, authorities revealed that some sightings were mistakenly attributed to manned aircraft, helicopters, or even stars.According to the DHS, over one million drones are lawfully registered with the FAA in the United States. On any given day, thousands of commercial, hobbyist, and law enforcement drones operate legally in US airspace, and this number is expected to grow with advancements in technology.Meanwhile, for weeks, residents in New Jersey and other US states have reported witnessing thousands of unidentified lighted drones flying overhead, fueling conspiracy theories and raising public anxiety. The unusual phenomenon led lawmakers to press the Biden administration for answers about the mysterious sightings.","Drones and a mysterious winged aircraft were captured flying over NJ.

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday accused western nations of acting as if they are ""God's representatives on Earth"" by imposing self-serving and shifting rules to maintain global dominance .Speaking at a Russian defence ministry meeting, Putin targeted the West's geopolitical policies and warned of potential retaliation in response to rising tensions.Putin pointed out that the global military and political situation remains ""complicated and unstable"", citing conflicts in the Middle East and other regions. He accused the US and its allies of enforcing “so-called rules” that constantly change for their own convenience, asserting: “There is only one stable rule: no rules for those who make the rules, for those who consider themselves to be at the head of the whole world, those who consider themselves to be representatives of God on Earth, although they themselves do not believe in God”The Russian president claimed that those who refuse to conform to Western policies are targeted through hybrid wars and containment strategies, pointing to Russia as a primary example, reported RT.He accused the US of “pumping” Ukraine with weapons, mercenaries, and military advisers to provoke further escalation of the conflict. He argued that these actions are part of an effort to weaken Russia and achieve a “strategic defeat”.Putin further attacked Western nations for allegedly using Russia’s responses to instill fear among their own citizens, saying: “The West is instilling fear into its populations, pushing us to the red line and using our reactions to frighten their societies further.” He warned that continuedmilitary support for Ukraine and Nato's growing presence near Russia’s borders would leave Moscow with no choice but to retaliate.Putin also emphasised that Russia’s army, navy, and strategic nuclear forces are being equipped with “modern weapons”. The president referenced Russia’s revised nuclear doctrine , officially updated in November, which lowers the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons. The new policy permits deployment in response to a nuclear or conventional attack that poses “a critical threat to Russia’s sovereignty and/or territorial integrity.” It also treats attacks by non-nuclear nations backed by nuclear-armed states as a “joint attack.”","Russian President Vladimir Putin accused western nations of acting as if they are ""God's representatives on Earth"" Putin warned of potential retaliation in response to rising tensions.

BAREILLY: Kirtans and bhajans echoed through the Shiv-Hanuman temple in Sambhal two days after its reopening on December 14, which had remained abandoned for 46 years following the 1978 riots . On Monday, the district administration officially renamed the temple "" Sambhaleshwar Mahadev "" and announced plans for its restoration following the discovery of idols of Parvati, Lakshmi, and Ganesha in an ancient well.District magistrate Rajender Pensiya said, ""The temple will undergo restoration and get a complete makeover. Efforts are being made to protect the site and its surroundings."" Sambhal ASP Shrish Chandra said broken idols of Lord Ganesha and Lord Kartikeya were found during the excavation of an ancient well.

President offers support to victims' families

Wisconsin school shooting

US President Joe Biden condemned the shooting at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin , which killed a teacher and a teenage student and injured others. He called for immediate action from Congress on gun safety legislation.Biden expressed grief for the victims and their families. He stressed the need to protect children from gun violence.“Today, families in Madison, Wisconsin, are grieving the loss of those who were killed and wounded at Abundant Life Christian School. It’s shocking and unconscionable,” Biden said in a White House statement.“We need Congress to act. Now,"" he added.The President pointed to other school shootings, including those in Newtown, Uvalde, and Parkland, and stressed the widespread nature of gun violence impacting children.“From Newtown to Uvalde, Parkland to Madison, to so many other shootings that don’t receive attention – it is unacceptable that we are unable to protect our children from this scourge of gun violence. We cannot continue to accept it as normal. Every child deserves to feel safe in their classroom. Students across our country should be learning how to read and write – not having to learn how to duck and cover.”Biden said that his administration has implemented gun safety measures, including passing legislation and creating a White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention . He also noted his executive actions aimed at reducing gun violence. However, he reiterated the need for Congress to pass further laws, including universal background checks, a national red flag law, and a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.“My administration has taken aggressive action to combat the gun violence epidemic. We passed the most significant gun safety legislation in nearly 30 years, I have taken more executive action to reduce gun violence than any other President in history, and I created the first-ever White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention. But more is needed. Congress must pass commonsense gun safety laws: Universal background checks. A national red flag law. A ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.”The President offered support to local officials and expressed gratitude for the first responders.“Jill and I are praying for all the victims today, including the teacher and teenage student who were killed and those who sustained injuries. We are grateful for the first responders who quickly arrived on the scene, and the FBI is supporting local law enforcement efforts. At my direction, my team has reached out to local officials to offer further support as needed.”He concluded by saying, “We can never accept senseless violence that traumatizes children, their families, and tears entire communities apart.”A shooting at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin, on Monday morning left two people dead and at least six injured.

The Allegations



'H6'



Yang's denial



Prince Andrew's role



China responds



A Chinese businessman with close ties to Prince Andrew has denied allegations of espionage after being named by British authorities as a suspected Chinese agent.Yang Tengbo , previously granted anonymity, waived his right on Monday to publicly respond to the accusations.Yang, 50, has been accused by Britain’s home office of working for the United Front Work Department (UFWD), an arm of China’s Communist Party that reportedly builds ties with influential individuals worldwide. Authorities allege Yang engaged in “covert and deceptive activity” on behalf of the UFWD and posed a national security threat .Judges sided with M15, Britain's domestic intelligence, saying that Yang ""represented a risk to national security"" and dismissed his appeal.The SIAC disclosed that in 2021, authorities discovered documents highlighting Yang's close relationship with Prince Andrew, the younger brother of King Charles III.In February 2023, Yang was removed from a flight from Beijing to London and subsequently banned from entering the UK. The Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) upheld the ban last Thursday, bringing his links to Prince Andrew into public view for the first time.The Chinese national, referred as ""H6"" in British espionage and media circles. H6 is believed to be among more than 40,000 operatives linked to the department operating across the globe.Responding to the allegations, Yang insisted he was innocent: “I have done nothing wrong or unlawful, and the concerns raised by the home office against me are ill-founded. The widespread description of me as a ‘spy’ is entirely untrue.”His lawyer, Guy Vassall-Adams, sidelined the claims and confirmed Yang waived his anonymity to defend his reputation.SIAC’s ruling revealed that evidence from Yang’s phone showed Prince Andrew had authorised him to establish an “international financial initiative” to engage with Chinese investors. However, the ruling provided no details about the purpose of the fund.On Friday, Prince Andrew said he had “ceased all contact” with Yang once concerns about the businessman were brought to his attention. Requests for further comment from the Prince’s office remain unanswered.China's foreign ministry dismissed the accusations, calling them groundless. A spokesperson said, ""China has lways been open and above board and has never engaged in deception or interference. Such speculation is not worth refuting.""","Yang Tengbo, previously granted anonymity, waived his right on Monday to publicly respond to the accusations.

""And there’s thousands and thousands of these kinds of flights every single day.""The federal government has faced a surge in reports regarding drones, especially around New Jersey, with the FBI receiving approximately 5,000 tips.

Trump Jr's public show of support

Kimberly Guilfoyle and Donald Trump Jr have reportedly parted ways, with sources claiming Guilfoyle’s fashion choices played a key role in their split. According to a Trump insider quoted by The Daily Beast, Trump Jr sought a new partner who could better win over his father, Donald Trump, and align with his expectations.Last week, Trump Jr was spotted holding hands with Palm Beach socialite and former model Bettina Anderson, signaling a new chapter in his love life. Reports by People indicate that Guilfoyle and Trump Jr's relationship had already been under strain for months, with Anderson entering the picture about six months ago. Sources suggest Trump Jr even took Anderson on a trip to Alaska while still in a relationship with Guilfoyle.A political insider revealed that Trump Jr had voiced dissatisfaction with Guilfoyle’s wardrobe, describing it as “too stiff” and “always professional.” Her signature look—brightly colored, form-fitting dresses paired with high heels — didn’t align with his vision. “Don Jr has been telling people for months that Kim is so uptight and never looks relaxed or casual. The tight dresses need to go, and she has been told that,” the source told People.Trump Jr's pursuit of Anderson reportedly stems from her ability to fit into the Waspy, high-society circles of Palm Beach—something that appeals to his desire to impress his father. “Someone like Bettina, who is and has been a model, is exactly the kind of person who would win over Donald Sr,” a source close to the Trump family told The Independent.Interestingly, Anderson reportedly pushed for Guilfoyle to be sent abroad as her relationship with Trump Jr grew. On Wednesday, Guilfoyle was named US Ambassador to Greece by Donald Trump. Sources said this decision was delayed until after the elections to avoid impacting Donald Trump Sr's campaign. “They waited for the election to pass but didn’t want the split to hurt Donald in any way,” a political source explained as reported by the People.Despite the swirling rumors, Trump Jr publicly praised Guilfoyle’s appointment on X (formerly Twitter), calling her “a fantastic America First leader.” The couple, who began dating in 2018 following Trump Jr's divorce from Vanessa Trump, has not commented on the split.As of now, Trump Jr appears focused on his future with Anderson, while Guilfoyle embraces her new role as ambassador. Whether the rift stemmed from fashion or other factors, one thing is certain—the Trump family drama never fails to captivate.","Kimberly Guilfoyle and Donald Trump Jr have reportedly parted ways.

The loss comes two months after the collapse of his three-party coalition government, leaving Scholz to lead a minority administration.In the 733-seat Bundestag , Scholz secured only 207 votes in his favour, with 394 voting against him and 116 abstaining, far short of the 367 votes needed for a majority. The vote was necessary under Germany ’s post-World War II constitution, which does not permit the self-dissolution of parliament.With the confidence vote lost, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier will decide whether to dissolve parliament and call for elections. He has 21 days to make the decision but is expected to do so after Christmas to adhere to the planned February election date. Once dissolved, elections must be held within 60 days.Addressing lawmakers ahead of the vote, Scholz said, “The election will determine whether we, as a strong country, dare to invest strongly in our future; do we have confidence in ourselves and our country, or do we put our future on the line?” He also pitched his vision of modernising Germany’s debt rules and raising the minimum wage.Scholz's government fell apart on 6 November when he fired his finance minister amid a long-standing dispute over economic reforms. The minister’s pro-business party, the Free Democrats, subsequently exited the coalition, leaving Scholz and his remaining partners, the Greens, without a majority.Friedrich Merz , Scholz's centre-right challenger, criticised the chancellor's record, saying, “You’re leaving the country in one of its biggest economic crises in postwar history.” Merz also accused Scholz of prioritising debt over the competitiveness of Germany’s economy.The campaign for the February elections is already underway, with Scholz's Social Democrats trailing behind Merz’s opposition Union bloc in the polls. Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck of the Greens is also in contention, while the far-right Alternative for Germany has nominated Alice Weidel.In foreign policy, Scholz highlighted Germany’s strong military support for Ukraine but reiterated his opposition to sending long-range Taurus missiles, citing concerns about escalating the conflict with Russia. “We will do nothing that jeopardizes our own security,” he said.Confidence votes are rare in Germany, which values political stability. This marks only the sixth such vote in the country’s postwar history, with the last occurring in 2005 when then-Chancellor Gerhard Schröder lost, leading to Angela Merkel's rise to power.","Olaf Scholz lost a confidence vote in parliament on Monday, setting the stage for early elections on 23 February.

Devastation and community response

322 school shootings this year

The shooting at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin, which happened just over twelve years after the deadly Sandy Hook shooting began with a chilling announcement over the intercom: “Lockdown. This is not a drill.” Sixth grader Breken Ives described the panic that followed as his teacher quickly moved students to safety, away from sightlines at the door, NYT reported.A 15-year-old female student, armed with a 9mm pistol, opened fire, killing a teacher and another student before turning the weapon on herself. Six others were injured, including two in critical condition, police confirmed.“This has obviously rocked our school community,” Barbara Wiers, the school’s director of elementary and school relations told AP. She noted that students had recently undergone lockdown drills in collaboration with the Madison Police Department. “When they heard ‘lockdown, lockdown,’ and nothing else, they knew it was real.”Police Chief Shon Barnes declined to release the shooter’s identity or details about a possible motive. A search warrant was issued for her home, and her family is cooperating with investigators.Parents were reunited with their children at a nearby medical facility, some in tears as they embraced their loved ones. “As soon as it happened, your world stops for a minute,” said Bethany Highman, who rushed to find her daughter safe after receiving a FaceTime call.The shooting has left the school community grappling with grief just days before the Christmas break. Wiers said plans to resume classes would be decided later in the week, with an emphasis on supporting students and staff through community gatherings.President Joe Biden condemned the tragedy, calling for universal background checks and stricter gun laws. “We can never accept senseless violence that traumatizes children, their families, and tears entire communities apart,” he said.This attack marks the 322nd school shooting in the United States this year, according to the K-12 School Shooting Database. It is the second-highest total recorded since 1966, surpassed only by last year’s 349 incidents.Firearms remain the leading cause of death among children in the US, a stark reminder of the nation’s ongoing struggle to address gun violence.

"Hush money case: 'No immunity for unofficial acts,' Judge rejects Donald Trump’s bid to dismiss conviction",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hush-money-case-no-immunity-for-unofficial-acts-judge-rejects-donald-trumps-bid-to-dismiss-conviction/articleshow/116383520.cms,"'This lawless case should be immediately dismissed,' Trump’s team reacts as immunity defense is denied

The hush money case

A New York judge ruled on Tuesday against a bid by US President-elect Donald Trump to have his hush money conviction thrown out, rejecting his argument that a recent Supreme Court decision on presidential immunity applied to the case.Judge Juan Merchan ruled that the immunity granted to presidents for official acts did not extend to the conduct involved in Trump’s conviction, which related to ""entirely unofficial conduct entitled to no immunity protections.""“Defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment and vacate the jury verdict... is denied,” Merchan stated, meaning that Trump’s conviction stands.Trump had sought to have the case moved to federal court, arguing that his position as president-elect warranted the dismissal of the conviction. His lawyers also presented arguments based on a July Supreme Court decision that grants presidents immunity from prosecution for actions taken during their presidency. They claimed that certain evidence presented at trial, including Trump’s financial disclosure form, social media posts, and testimony from White House aides, should have been excluded. However, Judge Merchan disagreed, ruling that even if some of the evidence related to official acts, it did not affect the case, which focused on falsifying business records .Trump’s conviction stems from a $130,000 payment made to adult film star Stormy Daniels in 2016, which prosecutors say was intended to cover up an alleged affair with Trump during the presidential campaign. The payments were aimed at protecting Trump’s election chances, prosecutors argued. Trump, however, has denied the affair and any wrongdoing.The ruling brings Trump closer to becoming the first president to enter the White House with a felony conviction, pending an appeal. His legal team has vowed to continue challenging the verdict, including raising issues of potential juror misconduct.As Trump faces the prospect of returning to office next month, the case is likely to continue as a source of legal and political controversy. Trump's communications director, Steven Cheung, slammed the case, saying, “This lawless case should have never been brought, and the Constitution demands that it be immediately dismissed.”Prosecutors have argued that Trump’s bid to dismiss the case went too far, with their office stating, ""Multiple accommodations well short of dismissal... would satisfy that objective, including a stay of proceedings during his term in office.""The case continues to unfold as Trump navigates his legal challenges, with the potential for further legal battles as he prepares to take office once again.","Donald Trump's bid to have his hush money conviction thrown out was denied on Tuesday.

Gun violence: A persistent crisis

A 17-year-old student opened fire at Abundant Life Christian School on Tuesday, killing a teacher and another student before taking her own life, police said. The tragic incident, which injured multiple people, occurred just days before the school’s scheduled Christmas break, leaving the community in shock and mourning.The shooting took place early morning at the private Christian school in Wisconsin’s capital city. Madison police chief Shon Barnes confirmed that responding officers did not fire their weapons and said the shooter’s death appeared to be a suicide.Investigators believe ""a female shooter"" used a 9mm pistol during the attack, according to an official who was quoted as saying by AP.Nine public schools in the area were temporarily placed on lockdown as a precaution after the shooting.The school had planned to break for the holidays on Friday, as noted on its website.President Joe Biden condemned the shooting in a statement, calling it “shocking and unconscionable” and renewing his call for stronger gun control measures.“From Newtown to Uvalde, Parkland to Madison, to so many other shootings that don’t receive attention — it is unacceptable that we are unable to protect our children from this scourge of gun violence,” Biden said. “Every child deserves to feel safe in their classroom. Students across our country should be learning how to read and write — not having to learn how to duck and cover.”Abundant Life Christian School is a nondenominational institution founded in 1978, serving approximately 390 students from kindergarten through high school. The school emphasizes a Christ-focused academic environment and is accredited by the Association of Christian Schools International.The school addressed the tragedy in a Facebook post: “Prayers Requested! Today, we had an active shooter incident at ALCS. We are in the midst of following up. We will share information as we are able. Please pray for our Challenger Family.”This shooting follows a disturbing trend of gun violence at schools in the United States. Just two weeks earlier, a gunman critically injured two kindergartners at Feather River School of Seventh-Day Adventists in Oroville, California, before taking his own life. The attacker, 56-year-old Glenn Litton, was reportedly mentally ill and claimed he was responding to America’s involvement in Middle East violence.In 2024 alone, there have been at least 202 incidents of gunfire on school grounds, leading to 56 deaths and 147 injuries, according to data from Everytown for Gun Safety. Last year, 45 people died in 158 school shootings, while 67 deaths were reported in 2022.The deadliest school shooting this year occurred in September at Apalachee High School in Georgia, where 14-year-old Colt Gray used a semiautomatic rifle to kill four people and injure nine. Both Colt and his father, Colin Gray, who allegedly provided access to the weapon, were indicted on murder and other charges.Firearms have been the leading cause of death among children in the US in recent years, according to research by KFF. While the nation continues to debate gun control, incidents like the one in Madison leave families grieving and communities questioning how to ensure their children’s safety.","A 17-year-old student opened fire at Abundant Life Christian School on Tuesday, killing a teacher and another student before taking her own life.

'I think that someone knows what they are'

A paranormal investigator and a drone pilot, Michael B, claimed to have chased the mystery sightings over New Jersey but his findings are terrifying as he said he lost control of his drone despite having a full battery life, not even three minutes into the flight. He said he was trying to track a mystery drone but his drone was shut down while the mystery thing remained airborne.""There was a drone just hanging out,"" he told FOX 5 New York. ""I had full battery life. Not 3 minutes into the flight, I lost control of the drone.""He said he saw a warning flash across the screen of his controller and the battery died with the drone coming down. He understood that his drone was probably shot down because it was a restricted flight area but the thing that he was trying to approach continued to fly. The paranormal investigator lives near the Picatinny Arsenal, an Army facility near where dozens of sightings have been reported in recent weeks. Since it was an Army area, it was possible that his drone was shut down but the other one continuing to fly seems to establish speculation theories that these mystery drones are probably sanctioned by the government and the Feds are well aware of them.As Michael B shared his horrifying experience with MSNBC, he said the issue, to him, seems more serious than just misidentified aircraft. ""At this point, I think that someone knows what they are,"" he said adding that he could not figure out what it was.Michael B added that it's clear to him that these mystery drones are capable of flying in restricted zones.

Among the detainees, the army initiated military trials against 103 accused on charges of treason and attempting to incite mutiny in the military. Though Khan was released after three days, he was rearrested two months later in another corruption case and has been in jail since. There have been widespread reports that the military also plans to prosecute him under the same charges. He, however, has already been indicted by an anti-terrorism court over charges linked to the May 9 riots.The seven-member SC constitution bench was formed as a result of a controversial amendment to the constitution in Oct this year.“The final judgment of 85 persons who are under custody and facing trial before the military courts be announced and remissions admissible to the said persons be granted, and persons who can be released after remissions they be released forthwith, and persons who have to yet undergo the sentence awarded to them, their custody be handed over to the concerned jail authorities,” Friday’s court order read.The Pakistan Army Act of 1952 had established military courts, which function under a separate legal system, primarily for trial of military personnel or enemies of the state.The decision to use military courts for civilians was taken by Imran’sadversary, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, during his first term in office, and was backed by the powerful military establishment.","Pakistan’s Supreme Court on Friday allowed military courts, though conditionally, to announce the reserved verdicts of 85 civilians tried for alleged involvement in May 9 riots.

PARACHINAR: Once again, Ali Ghulam receives mourners at his home -- his brother and nephew killed 40 years apart in the same sectarian conflict that was reignited this year in northwest Pakistan, claiming 200 lives since July alone.Thousands of residents are stranded without food and medicine in parts of remote Kurram district, which borders Afghanistan, as the government struggles to end clashes between Sunni and Shiite Muslims stemming from decades-old tensions over farmland.""Our generations yearn for peace,"" 72-year-old Ghulam told AFP at his home in Parachinar, the main town and a Shiite bastion of the restive district.The latest flare-up of violence has ""reopened wounds"" he said, recalling how his brother was killed in an attack in 1987 that also wounded another three of his brothers.Kurram, known as the ""Parrot's Beak"" for its protrusion into neighbouring Afghanistan, is bounded by dizzyingly high mountains, the northern flank of which includes the Tora Bora caves where Al Qaeda founder and 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden once hid.Pakistan's northwestern border districts have long been a haven for various militant groups, with militants and weapons able to flow largely unchecked in and out of Afghanistan.""I have never experienced peace in my life and have no hope my coming generations will live free of fear,"" Ghulam said.Tribal and family feuds are common in Pakistan.But they can be particularly protracted and violent in the mountainous tribal northwest, where communities live by traditional codes of honour and revenge.The latest round of violence in Kurram erupted in May and intensified in July, when gunmen opened fire on a council of elders attempting to settle the latest round of disagreements over land.Various truces announced since then have held for only weeks or days at a time.More than 300 shops and over 200 homes in Sunni areas have been destroyed, often by fire, and hundreds of families have fled.Pakistan is a Sunni-majority country with Shiites making up 10 to 15 percent of the population, or at least 25 million people.Members of the two sects have periodically clashed in Kurram, where Shiites are particularly vulnerable as they must pass through Sunni-majority neighbourhoods to access essential services.Kurram's location on the frontier of Pakistan and Afghanistan put it at the heart of the religious and political upheavals of the last five decades.In 1979, Shiites led a revolution in Iran and later that year the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, prompting Sunni hardliners there to rise up against them.Pakistan's military ruler Zia-ul-Haq aligned with them, funnelling thousands of Sunni militants into Afghanistan through Kurram.""It became a hub for arms supply to Afghanistan, including landmines, mortar shells, and weapons of all kinds. Every household in Kurram had a stockpile of weapons,"" Malik Attaullah Khan, a local tribal elder told AFP.Khan, who signed a 2007 agreement aimed at bringing peace to Kurram, criticised the government for failing to ""fulfil in its responsibilities"" in enforcing land settlements.The ethnic Pashtun heartland was merged into the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in 2018, but the Pakistani state maintains limited control in the merged districts.In rural areas of Pakistan, villages often bypass the formal justice system and men-only ""jirgas"" or councils made up of respected village elders resolve disputes, sometimes in the form of fines or land reallocation.Ghulam's nephew was killed along with at least 42 others last month, when Sunni gunmen opened fire on a convoy of Shiites being escorted by the police to their homes.In retaliation, a market in a Sunni-dominated area was set on fire.Syed Ghani Shah told AFP his cousin was burned to death inside his shop.""When we buried him, he was so unrecognisable that we couldn't even let his parents see his face,"" Shah said.""Can we ever make peace after all this? Never, if we ever get the chance, we will surely avenge our blood,"" he warned.Authorities have enforced curfews and road closures to reduce the chances of violence breaking out, providing escorts through high-risk areas and using helicopters to deliver supplies.But Akbar Khan, a representative of Pakistan's independent Human Rights Commission told AFP that the state needs to do more to resolve the issue.""In the past, jirgas were successful because they had the full support of the state. Now, the authorities don't even provide the expenses needed to hold a jirga,"" he said.Fatima Ahmed's husband was killed last month while travelling to Islamabad to arrange her admission to medical college.""I don't want to live a life without him. I've lost my will to exist,"" the 21-year-old told AFP.""They haven't just martyred my husband -- they've also murdered my dreams with him,"" she said, bursting into tears.",Violence in northwest Pakistan has killed 200 people since July.

"Pak ex-ISI chief indicted on charges of treason, graft, misuse of authority",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pak-ex-isi-chief-indicted-on-charges-of-treason-graft-misuse-of-authority/articleshow/116191351.cms,"Faiz Hameed

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's former Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), has been formally indicted on a number of charges, including engaging in political activities and violating a law on official secrets, during field general court martial (FGCM) proceedings against him, military's media affairs wing said Tuesday.Army's media arm ISPR said FGCM also charged Hameed with compromising state security and interests, abusing authority and resources and causing undue harm to individuals. ISPR said proceedings against Hameed were initiated on Aug 12 under provisions of Pakistan Army Act.Hameed, who served as ISI director-general from June 2019 to Oct 2021, was taken into custody from Rawalpindi four months ago when he was summoned to a meeting by a senior military officer. He was arrested over accusations about his involvement in land grabbing and snatching valuables and property from the owner of a private housing society. His arrest busted the myth that ISI chiefs were untouchable in a country where powerful generals have long wielded unparalleled influence in state affairs.""During the process, involvement of Lt Gen Faiz Hamid (Retd) in events related to creating agitation and unrest, leading up to multiple incidents including but not limited to the May 9, 2023 incident for fomenting instability, at the behest of and in collusion with vested political interests, is also being separately investigated,"" ISPR said. The May 9 incident referred to countrywide protests when PTI supporters stormed army installations and govt buildings following the arrest of party chief and ex-PM Imran Khan for alleged graft. To many, Hameed's close association with Khan was the reason behind his arrest. Khan wanted to continue with Hameed as ISI head but then army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa had been adamant on replacing him. Bajwa eventually succeeded and Khan could serve only a few months in office; he was later removed through a no-confidence.Independent observers say action against Hameed could put Khan under pressure and pave the way for the ex-PM to face a military court on charges of treason and attempting to incite mutiny in the military.","Pakistan's former Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), has been formally indicted on a number of charges.

He expressed concerns about his party's missing supporters.The Chief Minister said he saw the role of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and Pakistan Muslim League N (PML-N) in the crackdown against PTI supporters last month.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan ’s imprisoned ex-prime minister Imran Khan has threatened to launch a nationwide civil disobedience movement, in an apparent bid to keep his public mobilisation campaign intact and to force the country’s powerful authorities to agree to his demands.Less than two weeks after his “final call” protest in Islamabad was violently suppressed, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief has asked his supporters to converge on Dec 13 in the northwestern city of Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, to pay homage to party workers who were killed in the crackdown by security forces in Islamabad.His call for protest in Islamabad had mobilised thousands of supporters, primarily from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a province governed by his party. Imran’s party is believed to have organised the Dec 13 gathering in Peshawar keeping in mind his popularity in the region.Imran has also constituted a five-member team to discuss two key demands with govt: release of undertrial prisoners and a judicial probe into the crackdown on the Nov 26 protest march and the violence on May 9 last year. On both dates, PTI workers and Imran’s supporters held major protests, but faced a backlash from govt and security forces.“If these two demands are not accepted, a civil disobedience movement will begin on Dec 14. Govt will bear full responsibility for the consequences,” the PTI chief’s post in Urdu read.“As part of the movement, we will urge overseas Pakistanis to limit remittances and start a boycott campaign. In the second phase, we will escalate our actions further,” he added.The announcement followed Imran’s recent indictment for his involvement in an attack on military headquarters on May 9 last year, while he was also slapped with charges of terrorism for his role in protests that besieged Islamabad last month.Meanwhile, data submitted before the Islamabad high court revealed that the 72-year old cricketer-turned-politician is currently facing 188 criminal cases and inquiries. According to the data, he has been booked in 99 cases in Punjab, 76 in Islamabad and two in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.",Imran Khan has asked his supporters to converge in Peshawar on Dec 13.
