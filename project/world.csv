NEW DELHI: Two more houses belonging to suspected terrorists allegedly involved in the Pahalgam terror attack have been demolished, bringing the total number of razed properties to five.According to PTI, the houses of Zakir Ahmad Ganie in Kulgam and Lashkar-e-Taiba commander Shahid Ahmad Kuttay in Shopian's Chotipora were destroyed in controlled explosions.Kuttay, who has been actively involved in numerous anti-national activities over the past 3-4 years, joins the list of suspects whose properties have been targeted.Earlier, authorities demolished the houses of three other suspects: Adil Hussain Thoker (alias Adil Guree) in Bijbehara, Anantnag; Asif Sheikh in Awantipora; and Ahsan Sheikh in Pulwama.Intelligence sources reveal that Thoker, who legally entered Pakistan through the Attari-Wagah border in 2018, allegedly received terrorist training before secretly returning to Jammu and Kashmir last year. He is suspected of providing logistical support and guidance to Pakistani terrorists involved in the attack.The detonation was controlled to ensure adjacent dwellings were not damaged; the precision meant to convey the message that the authorities had no malice towards the general public.In what is being described as the deadliest assault since the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019, at least 26 tourists were killed and several others injured on Tuesday.The attack occurred in Baisaran Meadow, a scenic area located approximately 7 km from the resort town of Pahalgam, known for its natural beauty and tranquil environment.The attack took place around 1:30 pm, as tourists were relaxing in the picturesque meadow.Despite a strong security presence in the region, including multiple checkpoints and armed patrols, the attackers managed to breach defenses and unleash chaos in what should have been a peaceful tourist haven.","Houses of Zakir Ahmad Ganie in Kulgam and Lashkar-e-Taiba commander Shahid Ahmad Kuttay in Shopian's Chotipora destroyed in controlled explosions.

No casualties have been reported.”Military sources confirmed similar incidents had occurred a day earlier, with Pakistani forces initiating small arms fire at several points along the LoC. “The firing was effectively responded to,” a source said.The ceasefire violations come amid heightened tensions between India and Pakistan following Tuesday’s terrorist attack in Pahalgam that killed 26 people. The Indian Army has since stepped up counter-terror operations and reviewed preparedness, with Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi visiting Srinagar to assess the situation with senior commanders.India has announced a series of strong diplomatic and strategic measures in response to the attack, including the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty , closure of the Attari land-border crossing, and expulsion of Pakistani military attachés. All Pakistanis who entered via Attari have been asked to leave India by May 1.In retaliation, Pakistan shut its airspace to Indian airlines and suspended trade with India, including through third countries. It also rejected India’s move to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty, warning that any attempt to stop water flows will be treated as an “act of war”.Amid national outrage, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday vowed to bring the perpetrators of the Pahalgam attack to justice. Speaking at a rally in Bihar’s Madhubani, he said, “India will identify, track, and punish every terrorist and their backers. We will pursue them to the ends of the earth.”",Pakistan violated the ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir by resorting to unprovoked small arms firing from multiple posts.

'Avenger' video may be PR stunt, no such outfit operational in Agra: Cops



Hours after restaurant worker Gulfam Ali, 27, was shot dead and his co-worker injured in Agra, a self-proclaimed 'gau rakshak' who identified himself as Manoj Chaudhary and said he was a member of ' Kshatriya Gau Raksha Dal ', took to social media on Friday to announce the murder was ""retribution"" for the Pahalgam attack in which 26 tourists were killed. He said ""there were more deaths to be avenged"".A widely circulated video on social media purportedly shows a man, with two pistols tucked into his jeans and knives strapped on, claiming responsibility for the killing. In the video, Manoj Chaudhary, accompanied by another man who is similarly armed, is heard saying: ""Two k#### (slur) were killed in Taj city Agra. Kshatriya Gau Raksha Dal takes responsibility for this. I pledge in the name of Bharat Mata that if we do not avenge the killing of 26 with 2,600, I am not a son of Bharat Mata."" He then raises a religious slogan.Identity of Chaudhary's associate is not known. Police, however, rejected the claims, ""No organisation in the name of 'Kshatriya Gau Raksha Dal' is operational (here). The video on social media appears to be a publicity stunt. An FIR has been registered at Tajganj and a probe is on.""Agra police commissioner Deepak Kumar told TOI: ""The crime was a fallout of a quarrel over quality of food a few days ago. Investigation has revealed that the two men in the video are not Kshatriyas, and their self-declared status as gau rakshaks is also doubtful. At this stage, it appears to be more of a publicity stunt. CCTV footage from the crime scene shows the presence of four individuals.

Talking to local TV channels in Jaunpur, she said, “There was a ponywalla who didn’t seem to be part of the group of ponywallas when they were ascending towards Baisaran, but he was walking with them.”“He asked me from which place you are. I said I am from Rajasthan but now live in UP. He asked me whether I had ever been to Ajmer Dargah. I said no, I’ve never been to Ajmer. Then he asked whether I was Hindu or Muslim. I told him I am Hindu. He asked if I had ever read the Quran, and I said no, I hadn’t,” she claimed.She claimed he then asked if she could read the Quran in Hindi. She said he also told her that if she came for the Amarnath Yatra he would arrange it without registration. “I tried to avoid his conversation,” she said.She said he then took out his phone from his boots and started saying he was sending 35 people in the valley. “Then he said Plan A has failed and he also talked about guns.

Nepal medic killed in Pahalgam didn’t get time to say he was a foreigner,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nepal-medic-killed-in-pahalgam-didnt-get-time-to-say-he-was-a-foreigner/articleshow/120592414.cms,"Sudeep Neupane, 27, was the only foreign national killed in the terror attack on tourists in Pahalgam.

NEW DELHI: After travelling across three states and an international border, the body of Sudeep Neupane , 27, the only foreign national killed in the terror attack on tourists in Pahalgam, reached his home in Kalikanagar, a neighbourhood in Butwal, western Nepal, draped in the national flag.He was cremated at Triveni Ghat around noon, with hundreds, including local govt officials, gathered for the last rites. Sudeep, his family said, was shot immediately after he identified himself as a Hindu and had no time to explain that he was not from India.Butwal, a city in Lumbini province, sits just 25km north of the Indian border at Sunauli, close enough for shared economies and quiet daily crossings. It is not the kind of place where news arrives quickly, and yet by the time the ambulance reached Sudeep’s home, the neighbourhood had already gathered.Sudeep had travelled to Kashmir with his mother Reema, sister Sushma, and brother-in-law Ujjwal Kafle on April 19. It was meant to be a brief trip, just long enough to give his divorced mother some respite. On the day of the shooting, the family was walking along the meadow when a group of men with guns approached. Witnesses later said the attackers asked about their religion. Sudeep was walking slightly ahead of the others. He answered that he was Hindu. Before he could say anything else, he was shot. “He didn’t get the chance to say he was a foreigner,” said Tejulal Neupane , his uncle, who has since called for compensation from the Indian govt. “He had nothing to do with anything.”His death triggered a series of logistical efforts across two countries. His body was airlifted from Srinagar to New Delhi on Wednesday evening, then flown to Lucknow later that night. From there, it was driven overland to Sunauli before crossing into Nepal. A district magistrate from Uttar Pradesh accompanied the body as far as the border. At Sunauli, it was received by Dadhiram Neupane, Sudeep’s uncle and the ward chairperson of Butwal-14. A police escort led the final leg to Kalikanagar. Butwal mayor Khelraj Pandey, Rupandehi chief district officer Basudev Ghimire , and police chief Ranjit Singh Rathore joined the procession.Sudeep lived in Kalikanagar for most of his life. After his parents, Dhruv Neupane and Reema Pandey, separated, he stayed behind to support his mother. His sister moved to Pokhara after marriage, but Sudeep remained, managing the household finances, arranging care, and eventually becoming its only earning member. He held a public health degree from Dharan and was pursuing further studies in Kathmandu while working part-time on an oral health campaign in rural Nepal.The job did not pay much, but it was steady, and he had grown invested in the work. “He wasn’t just showing up,” said Amrit Bhusal, who runs Modern Samaj Dental, the clinic that had employed him for nearly a year. “He was doing follow-ups. He was tracking cases. He was committed in a way that was unusual.”In Pyuthan, Bhairahawa, and along the outer districts of Rupandehi, his visits became routine. He carried a clipboard and often walked between health posts on foot. When he spoke about public health, his colleagues said, it was in practical terms — transport access, dental hygiene, vaccine follow-up — not in abstract declarations.At home, he was quiet. Neighbours described him as careful and unobtrusive. Rajendra Kumar Acharya, who lives two houses down, remembered a brief conversation before the trip. “He told us he was going to Kashmir. He seemed happy to be taking a break. That’s all.” His 89-year-old grandfather, Khemananda Neupane, learned of the death indirectly. “My wife stopped my prayers,” he said. “She told me something had happened. I didn’t understand at first.”His father, Dhruv Neupane, a teacher at Bhawanipur High School in Butwal-18, was returning from a teachers’ protest in Kathmandu when his phone began to ring. “No one would say it outright,” he said. “Only when I arrived home did I understand what they had been trying to tell me. It doesn’t matter where I live. He was my child.”","Sudeep Neupane, 27, was the only foreign national killed in the terror attack on tourists in Pahalgam.

""But perhaps for people in govt, it is not a comfortable situation.""Hitting back at the governor, TN higher education minister Govi Chezhian said Ravi convened the conference in a deliberate attempt to pick a fight with the state govt since SC gave a ruling in govt's favour empowering it to appoint VCs.Chezhian said the governor organised the conference ""adamantly in violation of the law"" even after SC verdict. ""The VCs were aware that the conference was illegal and have skipped it. How is the state govt responsible for their absence?""Chezhian took a dig at the Vice-President as well.

NEW DELHI: After travelling across three states and an international border, the body of Sudeep Neupane , 27, the only foreign national killed in the terror attack on tourists in Pahalgam, reached his home in Kalikanagar, a neighbourhood in Butwal, western Nepal, draped in the national flag. He was cremated around noon.Sudeep, his family said, was shot immediately after he identified himself as a Hindu and had no time to explain that he was not from India. Butwal, a city in Lumbini province, sits just 25km north of the Indian border at Sunauli, close enough for shared economies and quiet daily crossings. It is not the kind of place where news arrives quickly, and yet by the time the ambulance reached Sudeep's home, the neighbours had already gathered.Sudeep had travelled to Kashmir with his mother Reema, sister Sushma, and brother-in-law Ujjwal Kafle on April 19. It was meant to be a brief trip, just long enough to give his divorced mother some respite. On the day of the shooting, the family was walking along the meadow when the terrorists approached. Witnesses said the attackers asked about their religion. Sudeep was walking slightly ahead of the others. He answered that he was Hindu. Before he could say anything else, he was shot.""He didn't get the chance to say he was a foreigner,"" said Tejulal Neupane, his uncle, who has since called for compensation from the Indian govt. ""He had nothing to do with anything.""His death triggered a series of logistical efforts across two countries. His body was airlifted from Srinagar to New Delhi on Wednesday evening, then flown to Lucknow later that night. From there, it was driven overland to Sunauli before crossing into Nepal. A district magistrate from UP accompanied the body as far as the border. At Sunauli, it was received by Dadhiram Neupane, Sudeep's uncle and the ward chairperson of Butwal-14. A police escort led the final leg to Kalikanagar.","Sudeep Neupane, 27, was the only foreign national killed in the terror attack on tourists in Pahalgam.

'Razings a stern reminder of price to pay for terror'



In a stern message to local terrorists and their families, J&K administration on Friday demolished the houses of three terrorists involved in the Pahalgam attack .The houses of Adil Hussain Thoker alias Adil Guree in Bijbehara of Anantnag; Asif Sheikh in Awantipora; and Ahsan Sheikh in Pulwama were quietly razed on Thursday and Friday night.The administration ensured that none of their family members was inside when the houses were destroyed. In fact, a source indicated they were aware of the impending demolition as they had vacated the houses beforehand with their important belongings.The detonation was controlled to ensure adjacent dwellings were not damaged; the precision meant to convey the message that the authorities had no malice towards the general public. There may be more demolitions, according to the source. ""The action is clearly aimed at disincentivising local terrorism or any kind of support to terror,"" a J&K govt functionary told TOI.It is a stern reminder to local youths that if they pick up the gun and join terror ranks, their families will have a heavy price to pay. Their families will also be denied govt benefits and facilities including passports, govt jobs, police clearances. This is all part of the Centre's and J&K administration's zero-tolerance policy against terrorism,"" the J&K govt functionary said.Adil, who legally travelled to Pakistan via Attari-Wagah border crossing in 2018, completed his terror training there and infiltrated back into Kashmir sometime last year, is said to have played guide to and arranged logistics for the attack team that comprised two hardcore Pakistani terrorists Hashim Musa and Ali Talha and a local terrorist from Awantipora, Asif Sheikh. Adil is said to have helped with reconnaissance of the attack site.Asif, one of the leading terrorists active in Tral, Pulwama and Kulgam, is said to have been roped in by the Pakistani terrorists since he was familiar with the terrain, hideouts and escape routes around Baisaran. Ahsan Sheikh, a LeT terrorist active in Pulwama, is said to have arranged logistics for Pahalgam attack.This is not the first time the home of a terrorist has been demolished by the J&K admin. A few months ago, the house of local terrorist Haroon Ganai from Anantnag, who was recruited by Pakistan's ISI, was demolished in a similar manner. An intelligence official said his family is believed to have contacted him after the demolition, cursing him for destroying their lives.",The houses of Adil Hussain Thoker alias Adil Guree; Asif Sheikh in Awantipora; and Ahsan Sheikh in Pulwama were quietly razed.

NEW DELHI: Blaming "" security lapses and intelligence failure "" for the Pahalgam attack , Congress Thursday said the deliberate targeting of Hindus in the heinous act ""masterminded by Pakistan"" is designed to inflame passions across India, even as it accused the governing BJP of exploiting the tragedy by using social media to sow discord and create polarisation. Congress warned Modi govt that counter measures announced against Pakistan should not be ""symbolic"".The Congress Working Committee meeting, attended by party president Mallikarjun Kharge, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi underlined that the terror-hit area is protected by a three-tier security arrangement and falls under the purview of Union home ministry. It demanded a comprehensive analysis of the ""failures"".""These questions must be raised in the larger public interest. This is the only way justice can truly be seen to be served for the families whose lives have been so brutally devastated,"" stated the CWC resolution.According to sources, Rahul argued in the meeting that it was a clear case of security and intelligence failure, and the party should not shy away from pointing it out. He reportedly said the party would support the govt in its actions against terrorism but the responsibility for the attack lay at the doorsteps of the govt, which controls the security in J&K.","Congress blames "" security lapses and intelligence failure "" for the Pahalgam attack.

Former Pakistani foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari threatened India days after New Delhi formally suspended the Indus Waters Treaty , following the deadly terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir.Bhutto, speaking in Sukkur alongside the Indus River, said, “India has accused Pakistan of the Pahalgam incident, with Modi making false allegations to conceal his own weaknesses and deceive his people. He has unilaterally decided to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty, under which India had acknowledged that the Indus belongs to Pakistan. Standing here in Sukkur by the Indus, I want to tell India that the Indus is ours and will remain ours. Either water will flow in this Indus, or their blood will.”Tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours have sharply escalated since the attack in Pahalgam, where 26 people, mostly tourists, were killed. The Resistance Front (TRF), believed to be a proxy of the banned Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba, claimed responsibility. India responded by initiating the process to suspend the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, citing Pakistan’s alleged support for cross-border terrorism .The government, through its ministry of jal shakti, sent formal notice to Pakistan’s ministry of water Resources. The letter, invoking Article XII(3) of the Treaty, pointed to demographic shifts, evolving clean energy needs, and Pakistan’s alleged support for terrorism as grounds for a review. India stressed that the treaty could no longer be implemented in “good faith” under current circumstances.Meanwhile, the fallout has triggered internal discord within Pakistan. The controversial Cholistan canals project, launched in February by the army and Punjab's provincial government, has been suspended following pressure from the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and widespread protests in Sindh. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met Bilawal Bhutto and agreed that no further canals would be built without consensus through the Council of Common Interests (CCI).At a joint press conference, Sharif confirmed, “Until a decision is reached with mutual consensus in the CCI, no further canal will be constructed.”“India’s announcement to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty is illegal and against humanity,” Bhutto had earlier said. “We will raise Pakistan's case not only on the streets but at the international level.”India has also begun identifying and sending back Pakistani nationals living in India on short-term visas. Union home minister Amit Shah has instructed state governments to expedite the process, while also calling a meeting with senior officials to discuss the implications of India’s decision on the treaty.","Former Pakistani foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari threatened India days after New Delhi formally suspended the Indus Waters Treaty.

"Students SEVIS Record Restored: All 133 international students, including many Indians, win lawsuit",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/all-133-international-students-including-many-indians-who-filed-a-lawsuit-get-their-sevis-records-restored/articleshow/120562167.cms,"File photo

The Trump administration has followed the orders of the US district court (northern district of Georgia) and reinstated the SEVIS records of all 133 students who had filed this lawsuit.As reported by TOI on April 20, the court had issued issued a temporary restraining order, requiring department of homeland Security (DHS) to reinstate plaintiffs’ SEVIS records retroactive to March 31, 2025. US govt agencies were ordered to file a notice of compliance of the reinstatement by Tuesday evening.Also read: Georgia district court provides interim relief: Blocks termination of legal status of 133 international students Charles Kuck, who represented the students, many of them Indians, said: “All students are now reinstated.” They can now continue to study or work under the optional practical training (OPT) programme. The next hearing is slated in the coming days.In some, but not all of the 133 cases, the state department has revoked the student’s visa. The revocation of an F-1 visa (which is granted for duration of status) does not necessarily impact the person’s lawful presence in the country. As such, plaintiffs contended it is the SEVIS registration termination that has rendered them vulnerable to devastating immigration outcomes such as detention and deportation.Increasingly, in the courts, the US agencies are taking a stand that SEVIS termination does not result in irreparable harm. Based solely on their latest contention, if a SEVIS record is terminated a student can continue with studies in the US. However, SEVIS termination notices received by students from their designated school officials ask them to self deport at the earliest as there is no grace period following a SEVIS termination. Further, it automatically terminates the work authorisation granted for an OPT programme .In a press conference American Immigration Lawyers Association 's President-Elect Jeff Joseph said, “We believe SEVIS termination does impact the status of international students. Thus, most of the lawsuits being filed are not challenging the actual visa revocation, but SEVIS termination.” He said US agencies are increasingly pointing out in court that SEVIS termination is just a credential revocation, it has no underlying impact on legal status. But this is directly contrary to their own outward facing guidance on their website, in response to inquiries as well as their own policy-guidance and training materials for DSOs.“It is our hope that if govt takes the position SEVIS termination has no impact on status, they revise their guidance... so that the kids can go back to school, to work and do what they intended to do, which is to come here and educate themselves and use that education to benefit all of us here in the US,” he added.","The Trump administration has reinstated the SEVIS records of all 133 students who had filed this lawsuit.

But I’ll also carry my father’s strength,” she told TOI, hours after cremating Santosh Jagdale, 50, who was killed alongside his childhood friend Kaustubh Gunbote in the Tuesday evening attack. Both families had travelled together to Kashmir for a holiday.The two men, residents of Karvenagar in Pune, were among the few tourists targeted by gunmen near the popular Baisaran meadow.“We were clicking pictures when we suddenly heard gunshots. There were screams. We hid behind tents. And then I saw them being shot… right in front of me,” Asawari recalled, calling the assailants “monsters”.Despite the trauma, she remained composed, handling her father's body, consoling her mother, managing formalities, and coordinating with authorities in Pune and Srinagar. “It’s difficult to believe I cremated my own father. I’m only 26, but I had to be strong for my family. I can’t afford to break down,” she said.An interior decorator, an insurance agent, and a farsan shop owner in Shivane, Santosh was known for juggling multiple roles with unshakable dedication. “He never missed a family event. And no matter how busy he was, he made time for everyone,” said Ajay, his elder brother.Santosh, who lived on the ground floor of a three-storey family bungalow, had grown up in Raviwar Peth and learnt the art of farsan-making from his mother, Manikbai. “He would sell the snacks she made when he was a child. That entrepreneurial streak stayed with him all his life,” said Ravindra Patane, a retired insurance manager and close family friend.Gunbote, the other victim, was remembered as Santosh’s shadow — a lifelong friend who had travelled on countless trips with him. Their families often holidayed together. The two were cremated on the same day, a few kilometres apart.Asawari said the past 48 hours had felt like a nightmare, but it was the kindness of strangers — including their driver and an Army officer — that helped them get through. “They didn’t leave our side for a minute. I’ll never forget that.”She has one demand now: justice. “No one deserves to die like this. I saw them fall in front of me. I saw what hate can do.

A senior Russian general has been killed in a car bombing just outside Moscow, in what authorities described as a targeted assassination likely carried out by Ukrainian special services . The incident, which claimed the life of Lieutenant General Yaroslav Moskalik , marks the second deadly attack on high-ranking Russian military officials in recent months.The Russian Investigative Committee confirmed that Moskalik, who served as deputy head of the main operational department of the General Staff, died after an explosive device was detonated in his parked vehicle in the city of Balashikha, near the capital. According to spokesperson Svetlana Petrenko, the bomb had been rigged with shrapnel to maximise damage, and video footage later surfaced showing the vehicle engulfed in flames in the courtyard of an apartment complex.Although investigators have not publicly named any suspects, foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova quickly accused Ukraine’s intelligence services of orchestrating the attack. “There are reasons to believe that Ukrainian special services were involved in the murder,” she said, though she offered no evidence. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov also suggested Kyiv’s involvement, accusing it of “continuing terrorist activity on our soil.”The blast comes just four months after another senior officer, Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, was killed by a bomb hidden in an electric scooter. Ukraine’s security agency later acknowledged its role in that attack, which also killed Kirillov’s assistant.The assassination unfolded as US President Donald Trump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff, was in Moscow for a fourth round of talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin revealed the pair discussed a potential return to direct negotiations between Russia and Ukraine. Speaking from Rome, where he had travelled to attend Pope Francis’s funeral, Trump declared that a peace deal was “very close” and that “most of the major points are agreed to”.Still, major obstacles remain. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy rejected any suggestion of ceding Crimea, insisting the peninsula, annexed by Russia in 2014, remains Ukrainian territory. “Our position is unchanged,” he said. “The constitution of Ukraine says that all the temporarily occupied territories belong to Ukraine.”Trump has hinted at accepting Russian control of Crimea as part of a peace plan. In an interview published Friday, he told TIME magazine: “Crimea will stay with Russia. And Zelensky understands that.”","Lieutenant General Yaroslav Moskalik was killed in Balashikha, near Moscow.

Florida’s St Pete-Clearwater International Airport (PIE) received a bomb threat, after a note was discovered inside an Allegiant Air flight , prompting an evacuation and a temporary airport shutdown.After a thorough investigation, the airport returned to normal operations by Friday night.According to the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office (PCSO), the Allegiant plane had landed from Cincinnati around 5:30 pm (local time) and was scheduled to return to the same destination.As the aircraft taxied from the gate, a flight attendant opened the rear lavatory door and found a written bomb threat, prompting the pilot to stop the plane and evacuate the passengers immediately.“Everyone was safely deplaned and there were no injuries,” Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said during a news briefing. The PCSO confirmed that the threat was ""very broad"" and appeared to extend beyond a single aircraft. “It wasn't limited to the particular plane and included all Allegiant planes at the airport,” Gualtieri added, as reported by Fox 13.Authorities subsequently grounded all six Allegiant aircraft at the airport. Bomb-sniffing dogs were deployed to sweep the planes while passengers from each were safely disembarked. No explosives were found on any of the aircraft, and the airport reopened around 8 pm (local time), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) confirmed.The incident occurred shortly before Allegiant Flight 2006 was set to depart for Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport at 3:59 pm (local time), according to a statement released by Allegiant Air. “The safety of our passengers and crew is always our priority,” the airline said, adding that it is cooperating with law enforcement during the ongoing investigation.As per ABC Action News, all passengers aboard the affected flight are being interviewed, and investigators reportedly have some suspects. However, Sheriff Gualtieri did not elaborate on who might be responsible for the written threat.As per the news agency Associated Press, the threat has emerged at a time when fewer Americans report feeling safe about flying, based on recent polling by the AP-NORC Centre for Public Affairs Research.Travellers were advised to check with their airlines for updates regarding specific flights impacted during the closure.","Florida's St Pete-Clearwater International Airport received a bomb threat.

Prosecutors said Jessup encouraged her to continue drinking despite her feeling unwell and provided her with three Long Island iced teas. After taking her to a strip club, Keesling became so intoxicated that she had to be returned to the hotel in a wheelchair.Keesling later woke up in their hotel room to find her father sexually assaulting her. Jessup stopped when she began to move. He was initially charged with sexual assault but entered a plea agreement with the Clark County District Attorney ’s Office, reducing the charge to attempted sexual assault.As part of the plea deal, Jessup must serve a minimum of six years in prison, register as a sex offender, and is barred from contacting his daughter or other family members for life.“Since my biological father sexually assaulted me on January 26 last year, my life feels like it’s shattered,” Keesling said in court during her statement before sentencing. She said she publicly identified herself after Jessup was elected to the Hancock City Council despite the charges.“I’m processing a lot right now in all aspects,” she said after the decision, adding that she has changed her last name and continues to deal with the psychological impact of the assault.Jessup, 50, was still serving as county commissioner when the incident occurred and later ran for city council while the charges were pending. He has since resigned from his elected position. In court, he said, “I’m not the same man I was.”“Fathers are supposed to protect their children. They’re not supposed to violate them when they are vulnerable,” said Deputy District Attorney Morgan Thomas.","John Jessup, a former Hancock County commissioner in Indiana, was sentenced on Thursday to six to fifteen years in prison. He pleaded guilty to attempted sexual assault of his daughter during her 21st birthday trip to Las Vegas in January 2023. Prosecutors said Jessup encouraged her to continue drinking despite her feeling unwell.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120635392,imgsize-723188,width-400,resizemode-4/John-Jessup-former-Hancock-County-commissioner-in-Indiana.jpg"

Virginia Giuffre , who became one of the most powerful voices against Jeffrey Epstein ’s global sex trafficking ring and accused Britain’s Prince Andrew of sexual abuse , has died by suicide at the age of 41, her family confirmed.She passed away at her farm in Neergabby , Western Australia.""It is with utterly broken hearts that we announce that Virginia passed away last night at her farm in Western Australia,"" her family said in a statement. “She lost her life to suicide, after being a lifelong victim of sexual abuse and sex trafficking”, the statement added.Giuffre, originally from Florida, was widely recognised as the face of the movement to bring Epstein and his enablers to justice.As per NBC News, she was one of the first survivors to publicly name Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell , providing critical information that aided multiple investigations, including the one that led to Maxwell’s 2021 conviction.""Virginia was a fierce warrior in the fight against sexual abuse and sex trafficking. She was the light that lifted so many survivors,"" her family said. ""In the end, the toll of abuse is so heavy that it became unbearable for Virginia to handle its weight"", her family added.In 2021, Giuffre filed a federal lawsuit against Prince Andrew, alleging that he sexually abused her when she was 17 after being trafficked to him by Epstein and Maxwell. The prince denied the allegations but settled the case out of court for an undisclosed sum in 2022, without admitting liability.Giuffre had earlier testified in Paris against Jean-Luc Brunel , the late French modelling agent who was accused of sexual abuse and also linked to Epstein. “I wanted Brunel to know that he no longer has the power over me,” she said after her 2021 testimony.Her brother, Danny Wilson , was quoted by NBC News as saying that Giuffre had been struggling with physical and mental pain. “She was in real physical pain — suffered from renal failure. But I think that the mental pain was worse,” he said.Her lawyer, Sigrid McCawley, described her as “a dear friend and an incredible champion for other victims,” while her representative, Dini von Mueffling, said she was “one of the most extraordinary human beings I have ever had the honour to know.”In her earlier appeals, Giuffre had urged authorities to listen. 'Take us serious, we matter"", she had told NBC’s Dateline.Epstein died by suicide in a New York jail in 2019 while awaiting trial. Maxwell was convicted on five counts of sex trafficking in 2021. Brunel also died by suicide in prison in 2022.","Virginia Giuffre, 41, died at her farm in Neergabby, Western Australia.

'I had no control over Trump winning in US and Trudeau resigning'



NDP leader Jagmeet Singh said the possibility that the party may collapse in this election does not frustrate him as he has always put Canada before the party. In an interview with the Toronto Star, Jagmeet said he stood by his decision to not go for an early election last fall when support for Justin Trudeau's Liberals plummeted as he wanted to stop Pierre Poilievre 's seizure of power.“While we could have won lots of seats, it would have meant a Pierre Poilievre majority Conservative government, and I could not stomach that,” Singh said.“I love my party. I care deeply about it. I want us to win. I want us to up our seats. I know we’re good for people. But in that moment, I made a decision for the interest of the country ahead of my party. And that was a decision I made wide-eyed, and I stand by that decision.”Jagmeet Singh said he has zero regrets because the circumstances were out of his hands. “Really, I have no regrets,” Singh said during the virtual interview. “I couldn’t control the outcome of the fact that Donald Trump came in and Trudeau resigned. I had no control over those circumstances.”“The math is just not there for the Conservatives,” he said. “People have chosen and this the way it looks like they’re headed. And I’m saying don’t give (Carney) all the power. Mark Carney is going to do things that are really problematic, and his track record is one that’s very problematic.”Some polls suggested that the NDP may lose its official status in Parliament and the party is also going through an internal rift. Former NDP leader Tom Mulcair says Jagmeet Singh cannot continue leading the party if this happens. ""Mr Singh knows what the results are going to be. I think he’s serene in his understanding of what it might mean for him, and I’m not getting any indication that he’s intent of fighting to stay on,” Mulcair said.","'I had no control over Trump winning in US and Trudeau resigning' Jagmeet Singh said.

The FBI accused Dugan of allowing Eduardo Flores-Ruiz , a Mexican national facing domestic battery charges, to exit her courtroom through a non-public jury door on April 18, allegedly to avoid arrest by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents waiting outside.FBI Director Kash Patel called Dugan an “increased danger to the public” in a social media post announcing the arrest. She was taken into custody en route to her courthouse office and later released following a brief appearance in federal court. Dugan has not issued a statement, with the chief judge noting judicial conduct rules prevent her from commenting on pending cases. Her court docket will be handled by another judge for now.According to an FBI affidavit, Flores-Ruiz, previously deported through Arizona over a decade ago, had returned without authorisation and was scheduled to appear in Dugan’s courtroom on three counts of misdemeanor domestic battery. After learning that ICE agents were waiting outside, the judge became “visibly angry,” allegedly diverted the agents, and directed Flores-Ruiz and his attorney through an exit typically off-limits to defendants.Flores-Ruiz was later apprehended by agents outside the courthouse after a brief foot pursuit.Dugan, 65, is a well-known civic figure, respected for her courtroom discipline and visible presence at interfaith and public events. Elected in 2016 after defeating a Republican appointee, she ran unopposed in 2022 and is serving a term that ends in 2028. She previously led Catholic Charities of Southeastern Wisconsin and served as president of the Milwaukee Bar Association. Her legal work has focused on civil rights, domestic abuse, elder law, and disability issues.Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson criticised the arrest as being “more about hype than community safety,” while the ACLU of Wisconsin warned the move could deter people from reporting crimes or emergencies. Meanwhile, state Republican leaders called the charges “deeply troubling” and said they undermine public trust in the judiciary.Dugan is due back in court on May 15, this time as a defendant.","Hannah Dugan, 65, is a well-known civic figure, respected for her courtroom discipline and visible presence at interfaith and public events.

Lawyers for Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil say they will argue that his deportation should be blocked after the Trump administration acknowledged he was arrested without a warrant.

Justice department lawyers argued the ""warrantless"" arrest was justified because ICE agents who approached Khalil on the street thought he might try to flee after refusing to cooperate with them.","ICE agents didn't have a warrant when they took Khalil into custody in March outside a university-owned apartment in New York.

Asked about the interview outside the White House on Friday, the president reiterated that he had spoken with Xi ""numerous times,"" but he refused to answer when pressed on whether any call had happened after he imposed tariffs this month. Trump's comments appeared aimed at creating the impression of progress with China to soothe jittery financial markets.But the president's claims of talks have been rejected by Chinese officials.

Authorities allege she escorted 30-year-old Eduardo Flores-Ruiz and his lawyer through a restricted courthouse door to avoid arrest by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers, who later detained Flores-Ruiz after a foot chase outside the courthouse.“Judge Dugan wholeheartedly regrets and protests her arrest. It was not made in the interest of public safety,"" said her attorney Craig Mastantuono during a brief court appearance following her arrest. Dugan was later released.The Trump administration has often accused local officials of obstructing federal immigration enforcement, and this arrest adds to an already fraught relationship between the executive branch and the judiciary. “The rule of law is very simple,"" said Attorney General Pam Bondi. ""It doesn't matter what line of work you're in. If you break the law, we will follow the facts and we will prosecute you.”Court documents reveal Dugan was alerted to the presence of ICE agents by her clerk. Witnesses said she appeared ""visibly angry,"" called the situation ""absurd,"" and led agents to the chief judge’s office before guiding Flores-Ruiz through a jury door into a non-public area of the courthouse. According to the FBI affidavit, the door was typically used only by juries, deputies, and in-custody defendants — not attorneys or un-detained individuals.Flores-Ruiz, who had previously been deported in 2013, was in court for a hearing on misdemeanor domestic battery charges . If convicted, he faces up to nine months in jail and a $10,000 fine for each of the three counts.Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers criticised the arrest, stating, “The Trump administration has repeatedly used dangerous rhetoric to attack and attempt to undermine our judiciary at every level.”Meanwhile, Senator Tammy Baldwin called the move a “gravely serious and drastic” action that could threaten the separation of powers . Civic leader Emilio De Torre, speaking at a protest outside the federal courthouse, said, “She was certainly trying to make sure that due process is not disrupted and that the sanctity of the courts is upheld.”The case draws parallels with the prosecution of a Massachusetts judge under the first Trump administration, which was ultimately dropped under President Biden.Judge Dugan, elected to the Milwaukee court in 2016, previously worked at Legal Action of Wisconsin and the Legal Aid Society. She holds degrees from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.","Hannah Dugan, a Milwaukee county circuit court judge, was arrested on Friday.

And they've had that fight for 1,000 years in Kashmir,” he told reporters. “Kashmir has been going on for 1,000 years, probably longer than that.

So, you know, the same as it's been, but they'll get it figured out one way or the other. I'm sure… I know both leaders. There is great tension between Pakistan and India.

She was released later.

What did the judge do?



Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan was arrested by the FBI on Friday on charges of obstruction and concealing an individual to prevent their arrest. FBI director Kash Patel announced the arrest and said the judge intentionally misdirected federal agents away from an illegal alien who was to be arrested. Though Patel deleted his first post, he made the same post later. Dugan appeared briefly in Milwaukee federal court Friday morning before being released after prosecutors said they would not ask for her detention before trial. Her arraignment has been set for May 15.The allegations stem from an incident on April 18 when Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents arrived at her courtroom to arrest Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a Mexican national and undocumented immigrant wanted for deportation.After being informed of the agents’ presence, Dugan reportedly became visibly angry, called the situation “absurd,” and confronted the agents in a public hallway, demanding they leave and insisting they needed a different warrant to make the arrest. She directed them to speak with the chief judge.Investigators claimed Dugan escorted Flores-Ruiz and his attorney through a non-public jury door into a private area of the courthouse, allegedly to help him evade ICE agents.Patel stated that Dugan “intentionally misdirected” federal agents, allowing Flores-Ruiz to temporarily avoid arrest. Flores-Ruiz was later apprehended outside the courthouse.“These events were also unusual for two reasons,” the complaint states. “First, the courtroom deputy had previously heard Judge Dugan direct people not to sit in the jury box because it was exclusively for the jury’s use. Second, according to the courtroom deputy, only deputies, juries, court staff, and in-custody defendants being escorted by deputies used the back jury door. Defense attorneys and defendants who were not in custody never used the jury door.”Flores-Ruiz and his attorney made it out of the courthouse before the suspect was arrested by an FBI and DEA agent following a brief foot chase.Flores Ruiz had been arrested after police were called to a Milwaukee home for a reported fight March 12.

"Public opinion moulded India’s response to terror, Pak’s ‘tit-for-tat’ came through generals",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/public-opinion-moulded-indias-response-to-terror-paks-tit-for-tat-came-through-generals/articleshow/120629321.cms,"Representative image

ISLAMABAD: The manner of Pakistan’s tit-for-tat response to punitive diplomatic measures by India over the April 22 terrorist attack on tourists in J&K’s Pahalgam highlights deeper structural differences between the neighbours.India’s decision to slap a series of retaliatory costs on Pakistan for cross-border terrorism was framed at a meeting of elected representatives led by PM Narendra Modi, reflecting democratic consensus amid a groundswell of public outrage over the killing of 26 people, all but one of them tourists.In contrast, Pakistan’s response came through the National Security Committee, dominated by military generals and underscoring the army’s outsized role in what would normally be an elected government’s prerogative. That this comes amid increasing political instability, with ex-PM Imran Khan of Tehreek-e-Insaf behind bars, adds to the dichotomy.By rejecting India’s allegations of involvement in the attack as “baseless”, Pakistan sought to deflect blame, emphasising its condemnation of the violence and extending condolences for the loss of lives.But foreign minister Ishaq Dar’s demand for evidence, while diplomatically sound, lacks credibility given Pakistan’s historical links with militant groups.Islamabad’s denial, coupled with its claim of a “false flag operation” by India, appears more rhetorical than substantive, as it fails to address Delhi’s security concerns or sway international opinion, with the US and EU condemning the attack and aligning with India.Pakistan’s suspension of the 1972 Simla Agreement, which established the Line of Control (LoC) and committed both nations to resolving disputes bilaterally, is a bold but risky move. It signals a rejection of the post-1971 status quo, potentially inviting international scrutiny over Kashmir, which Pakistan has long sought.However, this could backfire, as India’s stronger global diplomatic clout may overshadow Pakistan’s narrative, especially without concrete evidence to counter Delhi’s charge of sponsoring cross-border terrorism.Pakistan’s assertion that India’s suspension of the Indus Water Treaty was an “act of war” could be seen as highly escalatory, risking military conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours. The statement’s bellicose tone apparently aims to deter India and rally domestic support, but limits diplomatic flexibility.The decision to suspend trade, close airspace and expel Indian diplomats mirrors India’s actions, signalling a desire to project strength domestically and internationally. However, these measures risk further isolating Pakistan economically, already strained by internal challenges.The closure of the Wagah border and suspension of train services disrupt minimal bilateral trade, disproportionately affecting Pakistan’s smaller economy. Similarly, barring Indian airlines from Pakistani airspace may inconvenience India, but also isolates Pakistan’s aviation sector, potentially deterring foreign investment.Pakistan’s response, while assertive, lacks strategic depth and risks escalating a crisis it is ill-equipped to sustain. By prioritising symbolic retaliation over diplomatic engagement, Pakistan has probably undermined its international credibility and economic stability.","India’s decision to slap a series of retaliatory costs on Pakistan for cross- border terrorism was framed at a meeting of elected representatives led by PM Narendra Modi.

"After diplomatic slap from India, Pakistan plans surface-to-surface missile test off Karachi coast",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/after-diplomatic-slap-from-india-pakistan-plans-surface-to-surface-missile-test-off-karachi-coast/articleshow/120572164.cms,"NEW DELHI: Pakistan on Thursday issued a notification to carry out surface-to-surface missile test from its Karachi coast along its coastline within its exclusive economic zone on April 24-25, news agency ANI reported citing sources.Indian agencies concerned are keeping a close watch on all the developments, ANI added.This comes after India noted evidence of cross-border linkages in the attack and said the attack came “in the wake of the successful holding of elections in the Union Territory and its steady progress towards economic growth and development.”As part of its response, India suspended the 1960 Indus Water Treaty, shut the Integrated Check Post at Attari with immediate effect, and halted Pakistani access to travel under the SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme (SVES). Any such visas issued earlier have been cancelled, and Pakistani nationals under SVES have 48 hours to leave.Additionally, the overall strength of both countries’ diplomatic missions will be capped at 30 personnel by May 1, down from 55. The Resistance Front (TRF), a proxy outfit of the banned Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba , has claimed responsibility for the Pahalgam attack , in which most of the victims were civilians. Asif said Thursday’s National Security Committee meeting reflects the gravity of the moment, noting that such sessions are held “when issues related to national security are to be discussed.”India had last downgraded diplomatic ties in 2020 by reducing the mission strength to half of what it was earlier.In what is being described as the deadliest assault since the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019, at least 28 tourists were killed and many others injured on Tuesday.The attack occurred in Baisaran meadow, a scenic area approximately 7 km from the resort town of Pahalgam, popular among tourists for its natural beauty and serene environment.According to survivors, six foreign terrorists dressed in Army's fatigue uniform targeted their victims based on religion. The assailants reportedly asked individuals to identify themselves by name and recite Islamic verses before opening fire at point-blank range.The attack occurred around 1:30 pm as tourists relaxed in the picturesque meadow, surrounded by snow-capped mountains and pine forests. Despite a strong security presence in the region, including multiple checkpoints and armed patrols, the attackers managed to breach defenses and unleash chaos in what should have been a peaceful tourist haven.","India has suspended the 1960 Indus Water Treaty, shut the Integrated Check Post at Attari, and halted Pakistani access to travel under the SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme (SVES) Any such visas issued earlier have been cancelled, and Pakistani nationals under SVES have 48 hours to leave.

Astrologer in Myanmar with 300k followers who predicted earthquake ‘in 12 days’ after deadly tremor arrested,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/astrologer-in-myanmar-with-300k-followers-who-predicted-earthquake-in-12-days-after-deadly-tremor-arrested/articleshow/120581055.cms,"A popular TikTok astrologer has been arrested in Myanmar after his viral prediction of another major earthquake stirred panic in a country still reeling from last month’s deadly tremor.John Moe The, 21, told his 300,000+ followers on April 9 that a “very strong” earthquake would strike “every city in Myanmar” within 12 days. “People should not stay in tall buildings,” read the warning, viewed 3.3 million times. “Take important things with you and run away from buildings during the shaking.”His prediction came just weeks after a real quake killed over 3,700 people and displaced 60,000, many of whom remain in tent encampments too afraid to return home. Authorities said the video caused renewed public fear.He was arrested Tuesday in a raid on his home in Monywa city, central Myanmar. The military government said in a statement: “We got a tip-off about fake news… Action will be taken effectively against him… and against those who spread or share fake news.”Though earthquake early warning systems exist, scientists including the USGS insist that predicting quakes in advance remains impossible. John Moe The’s account, titled ""John (Palmistry)"", also included cosmic predictions about political upheavals and foreign military strikes.Some, like Yangon resident Nan Nan, dismissed the video—but said others took it seriously. “Most of my neighbours dared not stay in their apartments,” she told AFP. “My friend even hired a small house outside Yangon in preparation.”As aftershocks continue and mistrust deepens, the arrest has sparked questions over the line between public caution and panic—and whether astrology should come with a warning label.","John Moe The, 21, told his 300,000+ followers on April 9 that a “very strong” earthquake would strike “every city in Myanmar” within 12 days.
