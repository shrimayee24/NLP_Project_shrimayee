Land rights and Sixth Schedule at the core



Hunger strike, misinformation triggered violence



Talks announced, arson continues



Internet suspended to prevent escalation



CM monitors situation, appeals for calm



NEW DELHI: Violent protests over alleged illegal non tribal settlement in Assam’s constitutionally protected Karbi Anglong hill region entered the third day on Wednesday, leaving two people dead, dozens injured, and prompting the state government to impose curfew-like restrictions and suspend mobile internet services in two districts.The violence erupted in West Karbi Anglong and adjoining Karbi Anglong district after long simmering tensions over land rights escalated into clashes between tribal protesters and security forces. One tribal protester died in police action, while a non tribal man was killed in a fire that gutted several shops in Kheroni, a small trading town that has emerged as the epicentre of the unrest, police said.Assam DGP Harmeet Singh said 48 police personnel, including senior officers, were injured after protesters armed with bows, arrows, crude bombs and stones attacked security forces. The DGP and IGP Law and Order Akhilesh Kumar Singh were among those injured during the clashes.Police said protesters attempted to take control of a bridge in the area and turned violent when stopped.“Today, they tried to take over the bridge, and when we tried to stop them, they attacked us. Crude bombs and stones were thrown. I was attacked with bows and arrows,” Singh said, adding that the police have video footage and will take legal action against those responsible.The protests are rooted in opposition by the Karbi community to what they allege is illegal encroachment by non tribal settlers on professional grazing reserve and village grazing reserve lands.The districts fall under the Karbi Anglong autonomous council, governed by the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, which grants tribal regions autonomy over land, forests and local governance to protect indigenous communities.Residents have for over a year demanded eviction of alleged encroachers, saying unchecked settlement threatens tribal land rights.Tensions intensified after members of the Karbi community launched a hunger strike on December 6. The situation spiralled on Tuesday after police shifted some fasting protesters to Gauhati Medical College and Hospital due to deteriorating health.According to police, misinformation spread that a protest leader had been arrested, triggering anger and violence.“A huge crowd has gathered here since yesterday. I met the protestors and spoke with them. Last night, their leader was taken to Guwahati for a medical check-up as the doctors thought that his health was deteriorating because of the hunger strike. Still, someone spread misinformation that he is being arrested. Violence does not get anything for anybody,” DGP Harmeet Singh told reporters.State cabinet minister Ranoj Pegu, who met protesters at Kheroni earlier, said the group agreed to call off the hunger strike and participate in tripartite talks on December 26 involving the state government and the Karbi Anglong Autonomous Council.“We assured the Karbi community that the government is serious about land rights and other tribal issues,” Pegu said, adding that discussions would address “broader issues related to existence of Karbi community.”Despite the assurance of talks, violence continued through the day, with shops and markets in Kheroni set ablaze. Police said a special investigation team has been formed and video footage is being examined to identify those involved in arson and attacks.In response to the deteriorating law and order situation, the Assam government on Tuesday ordered suspension of internet and mobile data services in Karbi Anglong and West Karbi Anglong districts with immediate effect.“It is, however, clarified that the voice calls and the broadband connectivity based on fixed telephone lines shall remain functional during this period. Any violation of the promulgation will be punishable under Section 223 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 and also under the relevant provision of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885,” said Biswajit Pegu, Commissioner and Secretary to the Government of Assam, Home and Political Department.The government said district magistrates warned that social media could be used to spread inflammatory messages and rumours, further aggravating tensions.Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said he was closely monitoring the situation and announced deployment of additional forces in Kheroni, about 250 km east of Guwahati.“It is deeply painful that two persons lost their lives during today’s unrest,” Sarma said in a post on X, offering condolences to the families of the deceased and assuring all possible support.Authorities said efforts are under way to restore calm, urging community leaders to restrain youths and prevent further violence ahead of the scheduled talks later this week.","Violent protests over alleged illegal non tribal settlement in Assam enter third day.

Mathura man gets life for raping 13-year-old mentally challenged girl,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mathura-man-gets-life-for-raping-13-year-old-mentally-challenged-girl/articleshow/126150954.cms,".

AGRA: A 34-year-old man from Mathura has been sentenced to life imprisonment for raping a 13-year-old mentally challenged girl. Special public prosecutor Rampal Singh said the incident came to light late on the night of Jan 19, 2024, when the girl’s mother woke up around 2am and found her daughter missing. “The family searched the area and, around 3.45am, spotted the girl walking back home with multiple injury marks and bleeding,” Singh said.The parents immediately took her to the local police station, where her father lodged an FIR against an unknown person under IPC sections 376 (rape), 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt) and provisions of the Pocso Act. A subsequent medical examination confirmed that the minor, who was a Class 5 student at the time, had been raped.Later, in a statement given before the magistrate, recorded under CrpC section 164, the girl identified the accused, a neighbour, and said he had threatened to kill her if she disclosed the incident. Police then scanned footage from nearby CCTV cameras, traced the accused and arrested him three days later.He has remained behind bars since. Police also found that he had at least six criminal cases registered against him, including those related to criminal intimidation and rioting. While delivering the verdict on Monday, the special Pocso court of judge Brijesh Kumar-II in Mathura observed that the crime was “heinous in nature, particularly as it involved a minor with learning difficulties, and warranted the maximum punishment under the law”. It also imposed a fine of Rs 1.1 lakh on the convict, directing that the entire amount be paid to the girl’s family for her rehabilitation.In case of non-payment, the convict will have to undergo an additional year of imprisonment.","A 34-year-old man from Mathura has been sentenced to life imprisonment for raping a mentally challenged girl.

Sheikh Hasina Slams Yunus Over Violence In Bangladesh, Calls Out 'Hostile Statements Against India'

Former Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina reacted to the death of student leader Sharif Usman Hadi, accusing the Muhammad Yunus-led interim government of presiding over “lawlessness” and claiming the violence reflects a breakdown of governance that has worsened since her ouster.In an email interview with ANI, Hasina said the killing of the youth leader underscored a growing culture of violence under the interim administration, warning that the situation was destabilising Bangladesh internally and straining ties with neighbouring countries, particularly India.“This tragic killing reflects the lawlessness that uprooted my government and has multiplied under Yunus. Violence has become the norm while the interim government either denies it or is powerless to stop it. Such incidents destabilise Bangladesh internally but also our relationships with neighbours who are watching with justified alarm. India sees the chaos, the persecution of minorities, and the erosion of everything we built together. When you cannot maintain basic order within your borders, your credibility on the international stage collapses. This is the reality of Yunus's Bangladesh,” Hasina said.Her remarks came after the death of Sharif Osman Hadi, a prominent youth leader associated with Bangladesh’s 2024 “July uprising” and spokesperson of the political platform Inqilab Mancho.Hadi was shot at close range by unidentified assailants while travelling in a rickshaw in Dhaka’s Bijoynagar area on December 12. He sustained a critical gunshot injury to the head and was initially treated at Dhaka Medical College Hospital before being shifted to Evercare Hospital as his condition worsened.He was later airlifted to Singapore for advanced treatment and admitted to the Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit at Singapore General Hospital.Inqilab Mancho announced Hadi’s death in a social media post, stating that he had fought for his life for six days, according to Bangladesh news outlet Daily Star. An aspiring independent candidate from the Dhaka-8 constituency, Hadi emerged as a prominent political figure following last year’s uprising that led to Sheikh Hasina’s removal from office.Hasina also expressed serious concern over the killing of a Hindu youth amid the unrest, linking the incident to what she described as the interim government’s failure to protect minorities and maintain basic law and order.Referring to the lynching of 27-year-old Dipu Chandra Das in Mymensingh district, the former PM held the Yunus-led administration responsible. Das was allegedly beaten to death by a mob over accusations of blasphemy, after which his body was set on fire, triggering nationwide outrage.Hasina said such incidents were contributing to diplomatic strain, particularly with India and accused the interim government of allowing extremists to dictate both domestic and foreign policy.“The strain you are witnessing is entirely of Yunus's making. His government issues hostile statements against India, fails to protect religious minorities, and allows extremists to dictate foreign policy, then expresses surprise when tensions rise. India has been Bangladesh's most steadfast friend and partner for decades. The ties between our nations are deep and fundamental; they will outlast any temporary government,” she said.She further claimed that anti-India hostility was being deliberately fuelled by radical elements emboldened under the current dispensation, pointing to attacks on diplomatic facilities, media houses and minority communities.“This hostility is being manufactured by extremists who have been emboldened by the Yunus regime. These are the same actors who marched on the Indian embassy and attacked our media offices, who attack minorities with impunity, and who forced my family and me to flee for our lives. A responsible government would protect diplomatic missions and prosecute those who threaten them. Instead, Yunus grants immunity to hooligans and calls them warriors,” Hasina alleged.Sheikh Hasina also warned of what she described as the growing influence of radical Islamist forces, claiming the interim government had released convicted terrorists and allowed extremist-linked groups to enter public life, raising alarms about Bangladesh’s secular foundations.""I share this concern, as do the millions of Bangladeshis who prefer the safe, secular state we once were. Yunus has placed extremists in cabinet positions, released convicted terrorists from prison, and allowed groups linked to international terrorist organisations to take roles in public life. He is not a politician and has no experience governing a complex nation. My fear is that radicals are using him to project an acceptable face to the international community while they systematically radicalise our institutions from within,"" Hasina said.Separately, Hasina criticised the interim government’s approach to Pakistan, arguing that major foreign policy shifts were being pursued without democratic legitimacy.She said that Bangladesh had long adhered to a balanced diplomatic principle but accused Yunus of moving hastily to reorient ties after alienating traditional allies.“Bangladesh has always believed in friendship to all, malice toward none. Of course it makes sense for our country to have a stable relationship with Pakistan, but Yunus’ headlong embrace is inappropriate. Having needlessly alienated many of our longstanding allies, he now seems desperate to find a friend on the world stage,” Hasina said.She further stressed that the interim administration lacked the mandate to undertake strategic realignments that could have long-term consequences.“The crucial point is this: Yunus has no mandate to realign Bangladesh's foreign policy. He was not elected, so he has no right to make strategic decisions that could impact generations. Once Bangladeshis can vote freely again, our foreign policy will return to serving our national interests, not the ideological fantasies of extremists who have temporarily seized power. The ties between Bangladesh and India are fundamental and will endure long after this interim government is gone,” she added.","Sheikh Hasina slams interim government over death of student leader Sharif Usman Hadi.

NEW DELHI: Bangladesh on Monday suspended all consular and visa services at its high commission in New Delhi, a day after its foreign affairs adviser said Dhaka was considering “scaling back” its presence there, citing a protest held outside the mission over the lynching of a Hindu man in Bangladesh.“Due to unavoidable circumstances, all consular and visa services at the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi have been temporarily suspended until further notice. Any inconvenience caused is deeply regretted,” a notice pasted outside the mission said.The move comes days after India temporarily shut its visa application centre in Chattogram until further notice, following protest by scores of demonstrators outside the Assistant High Commission of India in the port city, the neighbouring country’s second-largest.Though New Delhi–Dhaka ties have been tense since the August 2024 ouster of Bangladesh’s then-Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in a student-led movement, the latest tensions were triggered by the fatal shooting of youth politician Sharif Osman Hadi, with a section of Bangladesh’s political class blaming India.Hasina, meanwhile, has been living in New Delhi since being forced to resign and flee.In a press release on Sunday, Bangladesh’s foreign ministry described the protest outside its high commission the previous day as “regrettable,” adding that the incident cannot be dismissed as “misleading propaganda”—a phrase used by the Ministry of External Affairs in a statement rejecting the way Bangladeshi media portrayed the demonstration.Meanwhile, Bangladesh’s Prothom Alo reported that the country’s visa centre in Siliguri, West Bengal, was “vandalised” during a protest over the lynching of Dipu Chandra Das, the Hindu man who was attacked by a mob accusing him of blasphemy.According to the report, a five-member delegation from the roughly 300 demonstrators entered the visa office and told the staff to keep it closed as a “form of protest.”A decision on reopening the facility will be made after the situation is ""closely monitored.""","Bangladesh suspends consular and visa services at its high commission in New Delhi.

Ties between India and Bangladesh have hit another roadblock after the killing of youth leader Sharif Osman Hadi in Dhaka sparked anti-India protests. Hadi, a prominent figure in last year’s July uprising in Bangladesh, was killed amid rising political tensions, triggering widespread unrest. Bangladesh government suspended visa services in India following protests outside Bangladeshi missions.Protests also erupted in Bangladesh following the killing of Dipu Chandra Das, a young Hindu man lynched in Mymensingh. Hindu religious organisations and minority rights groups held a demonstration outside the National Press Club in Dhaka on Monday. Protesters described the incident as part of a wider pattern of religious extremism, attacks on minorities and official inaction.Speakers said Dipu Das, a factory worker recently promoted for his dedication, was falsely accused of religious defamation before being brutally killed.India, meanwhile, has raised concerns over the safety of minorities, the security of diplomatic missions, and what it describes as misleading narratives emerging from Bangladesh.Muhammad Yunus held a half-hour phone conversation with US Special Envoy for South and Central Asia Sergio Gor.Yunus used the call to reiterate his pledge to hold general elections on February 12, saying the country was “eagerly waiting” to reclaim voting rights allegedly denied under the previous regime.Sharing the details of the conversation, US Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs said during the call Gor discussed the ""recent events"" in Bangladesh.""Today, Special Envoy for SCA Ambassador Sergio Gor held a productive call with Chief Advisor Yunus @ChiefAdviserGoB to discuss recent events in Bangladesh and shared US interests to advance prosperity through trade,"" US Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs wrote on X.Amid mounting protests, Bangladesh suspended visa services at its High Commission in New Delhi and missions in Tripura and Siliguri, citing unavoidable circumstances. The decision followed demonstrations outside Bangladeshi diplomatic premises, while India had earlier suspended visa services at its Chittagong mission after protesters attempted to storm the compound.Yunus insisted the interim government remained committed to delivering a “free, fair and peaceful” election within roughly 50 days, describing the vote as an opportunity to restore democratic legitimacy. At the same time, he warned that supporters of the ousted Awami League regime were allegedly spending millions to disrupt the electoral process, with a fugitive leader inciting violence from abroad.Inqilab Moncho, the platform Hadi led, issued a 24-hour ultimatum demanding justice, warning that failure to act would trigger a mass movement to oust the interim government. The group demanded a speedy trial tribunal, involvement of international agencies like the FBI and Scotland Yard, and accountability from home and law advisers. Its leaders accused intelligence agencies of failing to identify perpetrators and alleged Awami collaborators were embedded within security structures.Concerns deepened after another leader of the student-led uprising, Motaleb Shikder, was shot in the head in Khulna days after Hadi’s death. Police launched a manhunt but said they remained unclear about the motive or perpetrators. The attack reinforced fears that a coordinated campaign of violence was targeting figures linked to last year’s protests. With multiple leaders injured or killed, questions grew over whether the interim government could guarantee safety during the election period.Earlier on Wednesday, India had summoned Bangladesh’s envoy and expressed strong concern over extremist elements threatening diplomatic missions and minority communities. On December 21, the ministry of external affairs rejected what it called false narratives suggesting security breaches at Bangladesh’s High Commission in Delhi, insisting protests were brief and controlled. New Delhi urged Dhaka to bring perpetrators of the lynching of Hindu man Dipu Chandra Das to justice and said it remained vigilant over minority safety.Bangladesh’s interim government said that it may review the scale of its diplomatic presence in New Delhi if the situation continues to worsen. Foreign affairs adviser M Touhid Hossain's remarks came hours after India dismissed Bangladeshi media reports on protests outside the Bangladesh high commission in New Delhi as “misleading propaganda”.“Regarding the Indian press note, we completely reject it, entirely reject it. The issue has been presented as if it were very simple, whereas in reality it is not,” state-run news agency Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS) quoted Hossain as saying at the media briefing.From exile in India, Sheikh Hasina blamed Yunus entirely for Bangladesh’s instability, accusing the interim government of empowering extremists, failing to protect minorities, and undermining relations with India. She warned that lawlessness under Yunus had damaged Bangladesh’s credibility and endangered regional stability. Hasina claimed radical groups were exploiting Yunus to reshape foreign policy without a mandate, insisting that ties with India would normalise only after legitimate governance was restored. Her remarks added a powerful external voice to an already volatile political landscape.The assassination of Sharif Osman Hadi, shot at close range in Dhaka’s Bijoynagar area and later dying in Singapore, became the catalyst for widespread protests. A key figure in the 'July uprising' that toppled Sheikh Hasina, Hadi’s death sparked anger among supporters who accused the state of inaction. Demonstrations erupted across Dhaka, with calls for accountability growing louder as Yunus declared a national day of mourning. The killing also fuelled fears that political violence was returning just weeks before a pivotal election.The unrest soon spread to Bangladesh’s media houses, with violent mobs attacking the offices of Prothom Alo, The Daily Star, and other outlets in Dhaka. Prothom Alo was forced to halt print publication for the first time in its 27-year history. Yunus condemned the attacks, calling them assaults on truth and press freedom, and pledged full justice. Authorities later said 31 suspects had been identified through video footage, with several arrests made, but the damage to Bangladesh’s democratic image was already significant.","Muhammad Yunus held a half-hour phone conversation with US Special Envoy for South and Central Asia Sergio Gor.

NEW DELHI: Fresh violence was reported from Assam’s trouble-torn Karbi Anglong district for a second consecutive day on Tuesday, with at least eight people injured as a clash between two groups of protestors prompted police to resort to lathi-charge and tear-gas shelling to disperse them, officials said.In response, the state government temporarily suspended internet services in Karbi Anglong and West Karbi Anglong districts.The clash broke out after a group, including women and children whose shops were burnt by a mob on Monday, came out to protest against the initial violence. Meanwhile, agitators demanding the eviction of encroachers from the tribal belt also gathered in the Kheroni market area.Both sides were agitated, and security forces initially tried to pacify them. However, the situation escalated when the two groups began pelting stones at each other, injuring several protesters, police personnel and media persons covering the incident.As the situation spiralled out of control, police resorted to lathi-charge and later fired tear gas shells to disperse the two groups.The situation remains ""tense"" in the area, and additional forces have been rushed to the spot.Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma described the situation in Karbi Anglong as “very sensitive.”“Senior minister Ranoj Pegu is present in the district. I believe the matter will be resolved soon,” he told reporters on the sidelines of a programme.The violence occurred despite prohibitory orders being in force in the area.Earlier on Tuesday, protesters called off their hunger strike demanding the eviction of encroachers from tribal belt areas following talks with Pegu, the state education minister.The agitators, representing several political and social organisations, had been on a hunger strike for the past 15 days, pressing for the eviction of illegal settlers.After Pegu held discussions with the protesters, they withdrew the hunger strike following assurances from the government that tripartite talks on the issue would be held soon.Pegu also assured them that CM Sarma would also be present at the meeting.On Monday, four people were injured in police firing after protesters went on a rampage, setting ablaze the residence of Karbi Anglong Autonomous Council (KAAC) chief executive Member Tuliram Ronghang and around 15 shops in Kheroni Bazaar.The mob also attempted to attack the local police station but was thwarted by security forces.Following the violence, Sarma indicated that rumours had circulated claiming three hunger-striking protesters had been arrested, which led others to become “agitated.”“No one has been arrested. They were taken to Guwahati for treatment as their health deteriorated,” he clarified.The protesters are demanding the eviction of “encroachers,” most of whom they claim hail from Bihar, from Professional Grazing Reserve (PGR) and Village Grazing Reserve (VGR) lands in Karbi Anglong and West Karbi Anglong.",At least eight people injured in fresh violence in Assam's trouble-torn Karbi Anglong district. Clashes between two groups of protestors prompted police to resort to lathi-charge and tear-gas shelling.

There are also demands that I should enter politics.

Hindu Lynching Sparks Outrage: Shashi Tharoor Warns On Mob Rule, Priyanka Blasts Modi Govt Silence

Congress leader Shashi Tharoor hailed external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his ministry on Tuesday for establishing the Nalanda University campus in Bihar. He admired the university while attending a literature festival at the university, highlighting it as one of the MEA's significant but underappreciated achievements.""...I was hugely impressed by the Nalanda University campus while attending the @nalandalitlive. My warm congratulations to @DrSJaishankar and @IndianDiplomacy for this wonderful achievement, which deserves a higher rating among the many unsung contributions of MEA to our nation,"" Tharoor said on X.During his Bihar visit, Tharoor clarified his purpose was cultural, not political. He urged others to visit local attractions like the Bihar Museum and Bapu Tower.Notably, Tharoor has previously made statements supporting the Modi government, often differing from his party's stance. He recently pointed out India's absence from the world's top universities, saying ""India no longer hosts any of the world's leading universities.... While a few universities have now entered the top 200, none figure among the top 10 or even the top 50 worldwide.""The original Nalanda Mahavihara, dating from the third century BCE to the 13th century CE, was awarded UNESCO World Heritage status in 2016. Tharoor celebrated its rebirth after about 800 years since its destruction by Bakhtyar Khilji around 1200 AD.He emphasized that ancient Nalanda wasn't just successful due to lack of competition but because it was truly ""an extraordinary institution.""","Congress leader Shashi Tharoor hailed external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his ministry for establishing the Nalanda University campus in Bihar.

JAIPUR: The jolly red suit of Santa Claus ran into Sanatan lines in Rajasthan’s Sriganganagar district. An official order from the additional district education officer cautioned that any private school, including those run by missionaries and Christian trusts, found “compelling” students to dress as Santa for Christmas would face action.“For the past few years, children in schools have been made to dress up as Santa Claus on Christmas Day, even though Sriganganagar district is a predominantly Sanatan (Hindu and Sikh) area,” the order said. “There are very few Christian families here. In such a situation, organising such programmes in schools and putting unnecessary pressure on children is not at all justified.”The order followed a letter sent to the district education office by Bharat-Tibet Sahayog Manch. Its national patron is senior RSS functionary Indresh Kumar. Ashok Wadhwa, the officer behind the order, was unavailable for comment.The education minister’s office clarified that the move did not originate from Jaipur. “No instructions on this issue were issued by the minister or from the state education directorate,” an official from education minister Madan Dilawar’s office said Tuesday. “This decision was taken at a local level.”",Sriganganagar district is predominantly Sanatan (Hindu and Sikh) area.

If they had the command, Hindus in Bangladesh would not have faced the situation that they are facing now (while BJP is in office).

As if complementing Masood's remark, PTI quoted Priyanka's husband Robert Vadra as saying that ""Priyanka has a bright future in politics, and a time will come when people would like to see her at the top office.

GUWAHATI: Violent tribal protests against illegal non-tribal settlement in a constitutionally protected hill region of Assam left two people dead Tuesday - as Sixth Schedule protections and land rights ignited a volatile fault line. Assam DGP Harmeet Singh, IGP (law and order) Akhilesh Kumar Singh and 48 police personnel were wounded after crowds armed with bows, arrows, crude bombs and stones attacked security forces in West Karbi Anglong, a hill district bordering Meghalaya.Police said one tribal protester died in police action, while a non-tribal man died in a fire that gutted shops at Kheroni, a small trading town that has emerged as the epicentre of unrest. By evening, administration suspended mobile internet services indefinitely in West Karbi Anglong and adjoining Karbi Anglong district to prevent escalation. Voice calls and fixed-line broadband remained operational.The two districts are governed by Karbi Anglong Autonomous Council (KAAC) under Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, which grants tribal regions autonomy over land, forests and local governance to protect indigenous communities.Residents have for over a year protested encroachment by non-tribal settlers on professional grazing reserve (PGR) and village grazing reserve (VGR) lands, demanding evictions.Tensions sharpened after members of Karbi community began a hunger strike on Dec 6. On Tuesday, clashes intensified after police shifted some fasting protesters to Gauhati Medical College and Hospital following health deterioration - a move agitators allegedly misunderstood.State cabinet minister Ranoj Pegu, who met protesters earlier at Kheroni, said the group agreed to call off the hunger strike and join tripartite talks on Dec 26 involving state govt and KAAC. ""We assured the Karbi community that the govt is serious about land rights and other tribal issues,"" Pegu said, adding that discussions would address ""broader issues related to existence of Karbi community"".Despite the talks, shops and markets in Kheroni were set ablaze during the day. Police said an SIT was formed, videos were being examined and efforts were under way to trace the attackers.DGP Harmeet Singh, who was present on the ground along with the IGP, described a coordinated assault. ""It was a proper attack by protestors. I was attacked with bows and arrows, which had to be blocked with shields. I was also hit by stones,"" he said.Singh said protesters used gas cylinders to torch markets, hurling one at security forces. ""Govt is ready to talk. Violence does not achieve anything. We have all the videos and faces. Legal action will follow,"" he said, appealing to communities to restrain youths he said were ""misguided and being misused"".Assam Chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma posted on X (formerly Twitter) that he was monitoring the situation and announced deployment of additional forces in Kheroni, located about 250km east of Guwahati. ""It is deeply painful that two persons lost their lives during today's unrest,"" he wrote, offering condolences and assuring support for affected families.","Violent tribal protests against illegal non-tribal settlement in constitutionally protected hill region of Assam left two people dead Tuesday.

Voice calls and broadband services via fixed lines, however, remained unaffected.CM Himanta Biswa Sarma wrote on ‘X’: “I am closely monitoring the situation in West Karbi Anglong.

We are in constant touch with all concerned to restore normalcy and resolve issues through dialogue.My heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families.

I was attacked with bows and arrows, which had to be blocked with shields. I was also hit by stones,” he said.Singh added that protestors used gas cylinders to set shops and markets ablaze, even throwing one cylinder at security forces. “Govt is ready to talk. A date has been set for a tripartite talk over their demands. Violence does not achieve anything. We have all the videos and faces. Legal action will follow. My appeal to society is to explain to these youths that violence will not help. They are misguided and being misused,” he said.Appealing for unity, Singh said, “Nepal was running on tourism. Look at Nepal, what has happened there. Assam and the country are on the path to progress. My request is that we work together.”The two hill districts are governed by the Karbi Anglong Autonomous Council (KAAC) under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution.Residents have long protested encroachment on professional grazing reserve (PGR) and village grazing reserve (VGR) lands, demanding evictions for over a year.

He said the protesters agreed to halt their hunger strike and join tripartite talks with the state govt and KAAC scheduled for Dec 26.Pegu said, “The Karbi community has been on hunger strike since Dec 6 with demands including eviction from PGR and VGR lands. An unwanted situation emerged when police shifted a few hunger-striking agitators to Gauhati Medical College and Hospital after their health deteriorated. The group initially misunderstood this, leading to unrest. Today, we assured the Karbi community that the govt is serious about land rights and other tribal issues. ”Though land issues fall under KAAC’s jurisdiction, Pegu said the state govt would hold tripartite talks involving KAAC representatives to address the “greater and broader issues related to the existence of the Karbi community”.",Police sources said a tribal man died in police action against protesters and a non-tribal man in a fire at the Kheroni main market.

The accused, Balamurugan, 40, worked at a private IT firm. Both are natives of Salem district in Tamil Nadu.Police said the shooting occurred around 6.30 pm on 1st Main Road in the Rajajinagar Industrial Area. Preliminary investigations revealed that Balamurugan fired four rounds at close range. Two bullets struck Bhuvaneshwari on the head, while the remaining two hit her left hand, causing fatal injuries. The gunshots triggered panic among hundreds of commuters and pedestrians in the area, who ran for cover. Passers-by found Bhuvaneshwari lying in a pool of blood and alerted the police. She was rushed to a private hospital but was declared brought dead.Bhuvaneshwari had been living with the couple's two children - a 12-year-old son and an eight-year-old daughter - in a rented house in Rajajinagar.Balamurugan was residing separately and working in Whitefield. The couple, married in 2011, had been living apart for about 1.5 years following frequent quarrels. Police said the accused suspected his wife of having an affair, though this claim has not been substantiated.According to investigators, Bhuvaneshwari had sought legal separation, which Balamurugan was unwilling to accept. Six months ago, she was transferred from the Whitefield branch of the bank and moved to a new rented residence with her children without informing her husband. About four months ago, after tracing her new address, Balamurugan allegedly quit his IT job and shifted to Cholurpalya in Kempapura Agrahara to stay closer to her.Police said matters escalated further about a week ago when Balamurugan received a divorce notice from Bhuvaneshwari. Enraged, he allegedly decided to kill her. On Tuesday evening, while Bhuvaneshwari was returning home from work, he spotted her near Basaveshwaranagar police station and shot her on the road. After the incident, Balamurugan walked into a police station and surrendered along with the pistol. DCP (West) S Girish said the weapon had been seized and police were verifying whether it was licensed.

At least two people were killed and five others injured after an explosion at a nursing home in Pennsylvania. Five people remained unaccounted for as emergency crews rushed to rescue victims of the fire, cautioning that the numbers were still “in flux. ”The blast occurred on Tuesday around 2 pm (local time) at the Silver Lake Nursing Home in Bristol Township, around 30 minutes northeast of Philadelphia. Authorities and first responders described the incident as a possible gas explosion.“We understand that there are people trapped inside,” said Ruth Miller, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency, according to The Associated Press.Emergency crews responded immediately to the facility, working to evacuate residents and search for those who may have gone missing. Video footage on social media showed police cars, ambulances, and fire trucks with flashing lights at the scene, while flames and black smoke poured from the building. Windows were blown out, and part of the roof collapsed.The Upper Makefield Township police department called the explosion a “mass casualty incident” and urged residents to avoid the area due to the large emergency response, reports the Independent.Lieutenant Sean Cosgrove of Bristol Township police told Levittown Now that residents were evacuated by emergency crews, staff, and even bystanders. He added, “I do not know if everyone is accounted for or not yet. I’m not aware of any critical injuries but there definitely were injuries.”The nursing home’s last fire safety inspection took place in September 2024.

Epstein files out: Trump referenced in some newly released docs; DOJ calls claims 'untrue',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-accused-of-rape-in-newly-released-epstein-files-doj-calls-claims-untrue-and-sensationalist/articleshow/126148145.cms,"DOJ Epstein BOMBSHELL: Trump Did This On Jet With ‘Bestie’ & A Woman... | 11k More Files Released





The US Justice Department released nearly 30,000 additional pages of documents linked to Jeffrey Epstein, marking the largest disclosure yet in the long-running investigation into the late financier and convicted sex offender. The files also contained many of mentions of US President Donald Trump, although it includes an email from a prosecutor pointing out the flights that Trump took on Epstein’s private jet during the 1990s.The Department of Justice said that some material includes “untrue and sensationalist claims” about Trump that were submitted to the FBI shortly before the 2020 election. The department said those allegations were unfounded and false, but the records were being made public in the interests of legal transparency, with protections in place for Epstein’s victims.Among nearly 30,000 pages of material is now available on the official Justice Department website.An FBI intake report dated October 27, 2020, records a tip from a former limousine driver. According to that report, the driver described a disturbing phone conversation he claimed he overheard in 1995 involving Trump and Epstein. The document alleges that an unnamed woman present at the time told the driver “he raped me”, referring to Trump alongside Epstein, according to the People.The driver’s account says the woman later told him she had contacted police about what had occurred, and was then found dead in January 2000 by suicide. The details in the file are heavily redacted, and the authorities have made little to no determination about the allegations’ credibility.In an accompanying statement on X on Tuesday, DOJ addressed the claims. It said some documents contain “untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election.""The authotrity described the allegations as lacking any credible basis. “To be clear: the claims are unfounded and false, and if they had a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponised against President Trump already,” the department said.The DOJ reitarated its commitment to transparency and the legal requirement to release the records, but also said that the inclusion of such claims in the files does not make them factual.Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein. In public statements this week, the MAGA chief called the focus on the Epstein case as a distraction by Democrats, asserting that he “cut ties” with Epstein long before the pedophile's arrest in 2019.The release covers a range of material, not just the unverified rape allegation. Internal emails in the files show Trump was recorded as having travelled on Epstein’s private jet in the 1990s more times than previously known — at least eight flights between 1993 and 1996.Trump’s association with Epstein in the 1990s is well documented, but inclusion in flight logs or social records is not itself an accusation of illegal behaviour.DOJ is constantly being pressured by Democrats for not releasing the full bulk of files. Supporters of the Transparency Act say the public has a right to see government records, even if they contain unverified claims.The latest release follows criticism of an earlier batch of Epstein records, some of which were temporarily removed from the DOJ’s online portal amid concerns about protecting victims’ identities.

Arctic Showdown: Trump’s Greenland Envoy Landry Triggers EU Fury; Ursula Warns ‘Border Not for Sale’

Who is Jeff Landry?

Trump Greenland claims





The Prime Ministers of Denmark and Greenland, in a stance against US President Donald Trump 's appointment of a special envoy, demanded respect for their territorial integrity. They insisted that the US won't take over Greenland and that the sovereignty of the nation is rooted in international law.""We have said it before. Now, we say it again. National borders and the sovereignty of states are rooted in international law,"" Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and her Greenlandic counterpart, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, said in a joint statement. ""They are fundamental principles. You cannot annex another country. Not even with an argument about international security.""Trump, on Sunday, announced the appointment of Louisiana governor Jeff Landry as a special envoy to Greenland. This has added fuel to the ongoing tensions regarding Trump's intention of the US annexation of the land. Denmark's foreign minister, on Monday, told Danish broadcasters that he would summon the US ambassador to his ministry.Further in the statement, Frederiksen's office stated, ""Greenland belongs to the Greenlanders and the US shall not take over Greenland. We expect respect for our joint territorial integrity.""The governor of Louisiana, Jeff Landry, has been appointed as the special envoy to Greenland by Trump. While the exact scope of the role is yet unclear, Jeff shall still be holding the governor's office.Landry is a conservative fighter who, before winning the governor's race, was appointed as Louisiana's attorney general in 2016. Throughout his time in office, he became a frequent legal adversary of Democratic leadership, launching numerous courtroom challenges against the agendas of both the Biden administration and his predecessor, John Bel Edwards, including pandemic vaccine mandates, environmental regulations, etc.Being a staunch Trump supporter, Landry had also applauded the deployment of border patrol agents in New Orleans. The mission, known as Operation Catahoula Crunch (or ""Swamp Sweep""), set a target of 5,000 arrests of individuals without permanent legal status. Landry framed the move as a necessary strike against ""criminal illegal aliens,"" The operation sparked intense backlash for its heavy-handed approach and reports of aggressive tactics.In June 2025, Landry led a Louisiana delegation to the International Paris Air Show to boost the state’s aerospace industry and attract global investment.While Landry has little formal history with the Danish government, President Trump recently appointed him as the U.S. Special Envoy to Greenland. Landry described the volunteer role as a mission to ""make Greenland a part of the U.S.,"" sparking a diplomatic row with Denmark. This move follows Trump’s pattern of using personal loyalists to manage unconventional international priorities.Announcing the appointment of the envoy on Truth Social on Sunday, Trump went on to say that Jeff understands the importance of Greenland for the US' national security and shall be extending the US's interest.Later on Monday, reiterating the security claims, Trump said the US needed Greenland ""not for minerals"" and claimed Russian and Chinese vessels were operating extensively in the region, and said Landry would ""lead the charge.""""We need Greenland for national security,"" Trump told reporters on Monday, ""And if you take a look at Greenland, you look up and down the coast, you have Russian and Chinese ships all over the place.""In the initial months of his second term, Trump had expressed a strong interest in taking over the largely self-governing island territory. In August, Danish officials summoned the top US diplomat in Copenhagen following a report that at least three people with connections to Trump had carried out covert influence operations in Greenland.As The Guardian reports, according to a poll in January, the vast majority of Greenland’s 57,000 inhabitants want to become independent from Denmark but have no wish to become part of the US. The territory has had the right to declare independence since 2009.",Denmark and Greenland's Prime Ministers demand respect for their territorial integrity. They insist that the US won't take over Greenland and that the sovereignty of the nation is rooted in international law.

Elections are coming and he has been released on bail so that his wife can contest the polls,” she said. “If such a rape accused comes out, how will we be safe?”She demanded that the bail be cancelled, saying her family was living in fear since the order was passed. Despite her anguish, the survivor said she still believed in the judicial process and would approach the Supreme Court. “I have faith in the Supreme Court. We are scared that he has been released,” she said.Delhi Police later removed the protesters from the India Gate premises. Visuals showed the survivor, her mother and the activist being carried to a police bus as they pleaded with officers to allow them to continue their protest.Women’s rights activist Yogita Bhayana questioned the grounds on which Sengar was granted bail, saying the survivor and her family had been isolated throughout their long legal battle.“They have faced difficulties from the beginning. What has happened today that the accused was given bail?” she asked. “Rapists are getting bail, and innocents are being kept in jail. After his release, the family is under threat.”The survivor’s sister also spoke out against the bail order, claiming that unidentified men had been seen roaming near their house and threatening family members. “He killed my uncle and then my father. Then this happened to my sister,” she said, referring to the chain of cases linked to Sengar. “He has been released, but we are still in danger. At least if we were in jail, we would be alive.”On Tuesday, the Delhi high court suspended Sengar’s sentence in the rape case while his appeal is pending. A CBI court had convicted him for raping a minor and sentenced him to life imprisonment.The division bench of Justice Subramonium Prasad and Justice Harish Vaidyanathan Shankar granted the relief on the condition that he furnish a bail bond of Rs 15 lakh.However, Sengar will remain in custody for now, as he has not been granted bail in a separate case related to the custodial death of the survivor’s father.

NEW DELHI: Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) University has suspended a faculty member from its Department of Social Work following complaints about the content of an end-semester examination paper.The order, dated 23 December, said the university received several complaints regarding the paper titled ""Social Problems in India"" for the B.A. (Hons) Social Work programme, Semester I, for the 2025–26 academic session. The paper was set by Prof. Virendra Balaji Shahare.The question asked students to ""discuss the atrocities against Muslim minorities in India, giving suitable examples.""Taking note of the complaints, a JMI official said it found negligence and carelessness on the part of the faculty member. ""The professor has been put under suspension and an inquiry committee has been set up,"" said Saima Saeed, Chief Public Relations Officer, JMI.According to the suspension letter seen by PTI, the vice-chancellor, acting under Statute 37(1) of the Statutes of the University, ordered that Prof. Shahare be placed under suspension with immediate effect pending an inquiry.The office order added that the professor’s headquarters will remain in New Delhi during the suspension period, and he has been directed not to leave without prior permission from the competent authority.The question paper drew criticism on social media.A student-run platform associated with Jawaharlal Nehru University shared images of the paper, questioning the appropriateness of the question and alleging ideological bias.The post objected to the framing of the question and linked it to alleged violence against Hindus in neighbouring Bangladesh.Meanwhile, the Delhi University Teachers' Association (DUTA) also circulated the question paper, describing it as a matter of ""serious concern"".DUTA alleged that the question promoted a ""one-sided"" narrative in a centrally funded university and called for an immediate review of the question paper and the syllabus.

Libya’s army chief, Lt Gen Mohamed Al-Haddad, was killed in a plane crash while returning to Tripoli from an official visit to Turkey, the country’s prime minister said on Tuesday.Prime Minister Abdulhamid al-Dbeibah confirmed that Al-Haddad died along with four others in a “tragic accident” during the flight home from Ankara. The crash occurred after the aircraft lost contact shortly after take-off from Turkey’s capital.“With great sadness and sorrow, we have received the news of the death of Lt Gen Al-Haddad and his companions,” al-Dbeibah said in a statement. He offered condolences to the families of the victims and said the loss was a tragedy for Libya and its military institution, as reported by CNN.The prime minister identified the other victims as Maj Gen Al-Fitouri Ghreibel, Chief of Staff of the Ground Forces; Brig Gen Mahmoud Al-Qatioui, Director of the Military Manufacturing Authority; Mohamed Al-Asawi Diab, adviser to the army chief and media office photographer Mohamed Omar Ahmed Mahjoub.Turkish authorities said they lost contact with the Falcon 50 business jet shortly after it departed Ankara Esenboga Airport at around 8.10 pm (local time).Turkey’s interior minister Ali Yerlikaya said contact was lost at 8.52 pm after the aircraft sent an emergency landing notification near the Haymana district, about 50 miles southwest of Ankara.Turkish broadcaster CNNTurk reported that the jet had declared an electrical emergency and requested to return to the airport before communication was lost. The aircraft reportedly had a crew of three, all French nationals.Turkey’s justice minister Yilmaz Tunc said a full investigation has been launched into the crash and that authorities will examine “all aspects of the incident with great care.”Earlier on Tuesday, Turkey’s armed forces said Lt Gen Al-Haddad had been formally received in Ankara with a military ceremony as an official guest. He later held talks with Turkish Chief of the General Staff Gen Selcuk Bayraktaroglu as part of his official visit.","Libya's army chief Lt Gen Mohamed Al-Haddad was killed in a plane crash while returning to Tripoli from an official visit to Turkey.

Candace Owens criticizes Turning Point USA’s Charlie Kirk tent display after Erika Kirk meeting





Candace Owens is again speaking out against Turning Point USA, even after a long private meeting with its new leader, Erika Kirk. Owens made her views clear on December 22, 2025, when she shared strong words online about the group’s recent event in Phoenix. She openly agreed with comments made by comedian Tim Dillon, who called TPUSA’s event a “bad reality show.”Owens said the group now feels out of touch with regular people. She also questioned TPUSA’s choice to recreate a tent linked to the death of its founder, Charlie Kirk. Even though Candace Owens and Erika Kirk met face to face earlier this month and called the talk “honest” and “productive,” Owens’ latest comments show the bigger fight is not over. Her message is clear. The meeting helped with personal tension, but it did not change her views on how TPUSA is being run.The latest fight centers on a tent shown at America Fest, a four-day TPUSA event that started on December 19, 2025, in Phoenix, Arizona. TPUSA placed a full-size copy of the tent where Charlie Kirk was killed while speaking at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah, on September 10, 2025. The tent was part of Charlie Kirk’s well-known “Prove Me Wrong” booth.Owens reacted strongly. On X, she backed Tim Dillon’s comments from a podcast released two days earlier. Dillon said the event felt staged and focused on taking money from supporters.Candace Owens wrote, “Everyone was thinking it, Tim Dillon said it. It was out of touch and elite.” She added, “It is not and will never be relatable for blue collar workers to endure lectures from wealthy people telling them who is and is not evil.”She also questioned the tent itself, writing, “Recreating the tent Charlie died under for selfies? Seriously?”TPUSA supporters pushed back online. Some said the tent was meant to honor Kirk’s mission, not his death. Conservative commentator Karen Hamilton said the display showed Kirk’s goal to “challenge error with truth” on college campuses.This public clash comes just days after Owens met Erika Kirk on December 15, 2025. The meeting lasted more than four hours. Before it happened, Erika Kirk said both sides would pause public talk.After the meeting, Erika Kirk said the discussion was positive. Owens agreed and said, “Absolutely nothing was held back.” She also said they agreed on more points than she expected. Still, Owens’ new comments show she remains unhappy with TPUSA’s direction. As of late December 2025, Erika Kirk has not replied to Candace Owens’ latest remarks.Also Read: “I Pray For Her”: Erika Kirk Breaks Silence On Candace Owens Meeting And Says She Is Done With The Noise","Candace Owens is again speaking out against Turning Point USA, even after a long private meeting with its new leader, Erika Kirk.

“Jewish people were…”: Candace Owens sparks widespread backlash after making inflammatory claims about Jewish history,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/jewish-people-were-candace-owens-sparks-widespread-backlash-after-making-inflammatory-claims-about-jewish-history/articleshow/126150568.cms,"Candace Owens faces widespread condemnation for promoting a 19th-century antisemitic text and making baseless claims about Jewish involvement in historical atrocities, including the slave trade. Her remarks, made during a feud with Ben Shapiro, have sparked concerns about hate speech and the spread of conspiracy theories online, with critics deeming her comments dangerous and harmful.

Candace Owens’ remarks are being called dangerous by critics across the political spectrum





Candace Owens is facing intense criticism after a recent episode of her YouTube show ignited outrage across political and religious communities. During the broadcast, the conservative commentator encouraged viewers to read a notorious 19th-century antisemitic text and made sweeping claims about Jewish involvement in historical atrocities.The remarks came amid her ongoing feud with Daily Wire co-founder Ben Shapiro and followed renewed attention on her departure from the conservative media outlet. The episode has since fueled concern about misinformation, hate speech, and the growing influence of conspiracy-driven commentary online.Owens’ comments centered on Der Talmudjude, a discredited antisemitic book written by German theologian August Rohling. Holding up the text on her show, she told viewers, “I encourage other people at home to learn what is in that Talmud so that you know what Ben thinks of you,” before adding, “He doesn’t just hate me, he hates you, too, white men. He hates all black people.”She went further, accusing Jews of manipulating racial conflict and controlling the transatlantic slave trade, statements widely rejected by historians. “Wake up and learn the true history of slavery because that wasn’t exactly a white man’s sport,” Owens said.“Jewish people were the ones who were trading with us. Jewish people were in control of the slave trade.”Owens also accused Shapiro of acting as a “contract lord” and claimed he followed values that dehumanize others, stating, “They think that we’re animals, that they have a right to own us, make us worship them, lie to us, sue us, take everything that we have, and deceive us.”The episode escalated existing tensions tied to conspiracy theories surrounding the death of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk. Shapiro publicly condemned Owens’ rhetoric, saying influential voices have a “moral obligation” to reject what he described as “specious and evil attacks.”Advocacy groups and critics argue that Owens’ remarks recycle long-debunked antisemitic tropes, warning that such narratives risk fueling real-world harm under the guise of political dissent.Also Read: “The real monsters”: Rob Schneider blasts Candace Owens and Nick Fuentes, warns conservatives at TPUSA’s AmFest","Conservative commentator Candace Owens is facing intense criticism after a recent episode of her YouTube show ignited outrage across political and religious communities.

US diplomacy shakeup? Trump recalls 30 career diplomats from ambassadorial embassy posts; here's why,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-diplomacy-shakeup-trump-recalls-30-career-diplomats-from-ambassadorial-embassy-posts-heres-why/articleshow/126133146.cms,"(File photo)

Trump Immigration Offensive SHOCK Reveal; Workplace Raids, Expanded Detention Incoming Next Year

An ‘unprecedented’ recall of career ambassadors

White House defence and ‘America First’ rationale





The Trump administration has quietly ordered the recall of nearly 30 career diplomats serving as ambassadors and chiefs of mission across the world, triggering alarm within the US foreign service and renewed accusations of a political purge inside the State Department. The move, reported by various US media outlets, is highly unusual and has not been publicly announced by the administration.Those affected are all career Foreign Service officers who were nominated during the Biden administration and confirmed by the Senate. Unlike political appointees, career ambassadors are typically retained across changes in government to preserve continuity and maintain an apolitical diplomatic corps. Many were told abruptly, often by phone, to vacate their posts by mid-January, with no explanation provided.The mass recall comes even as President Donald Trump has repeatedly said he wants to resolve global conflicts through diplomacy, raising questions about the impact on US influence abroad.According to the American Foreign Service Association (AFSA), the union representing US diplomats, this is the first time such a large group of career ambassadors has been recalled simultaneously.AFSA said it had received “credible reports” from diplomatic posts worldwide that senior envoys had been directed to return to Washington within weeks.Former diplomats described the process as chaotic and opaque. One former senior official said ambassadors were being pulled “randomly”, with no clarity on why some were recalled while others were spared. AFSA warned that the lack of transparency broke sharply with long-standing norms and sent a troubling signal to both allies and public servants.Africa has been the hardest-hit region, with roughly a dozen ambassadors recalled from countries including Nigeria, Senegal, Uganda, Rwanda, Niger and Somalia. Other recalls have affected posts in Europe, the Middle East and Eurasia, including Egypt, Algeria, Slovakia and Armenia. The removals will leave dozens of US embassies without a Senate-confirmed ambassador at a time when China continues to expand its diplomatic footprint worldwide.The State Department has defended the move as routine. A senior official said an ambassador is the personal representative of the president and that Trump has the right to ensure envoys advance his “America First” agenda. The official confirmed the diplomats would not be fired but reassigned, though many face retirement if no new posting is found within a limited window.Secretary of State Marco Rubio has linked the reshuffle to broader changes in promotion criteria and departmental reorganisation, including a push to roll back Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policies. Rubio said hundreds of diplomats had been newly nominated for promotion under revised rules overseen by adjusted panels.Critics, however, argue the changes are designed to elevate officials seen as politically aligned with the White House. Powerful figures such as deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller have openly sought to reshape the State Department to support stricter immigration policies and a more ideological foreign policy.The recall has deepened an already severe morale crisis within the foreign service. AFSA recently released survey results showing 98% of respondents reported declining morale since Trump’s second term began in January. Many cited shrinking budgets, heavier workloads and reduced US foreign aid. Only 1% said conditions had improved.Earlier this year, the department announced around 1,300 layoffs, including more than 240 Foreign Service officers, as part of what Rubio described as a reorganisation. Several senior diplomats, many of them women or people of colour, also lost previously assigned overseas leadership roles.","The move is highly unusual and has not been publicly announced by the administration.

He is alleged to have directed covert intelligence and lethal operations against dissidents, journalists, Israeli citizens, and current and former US government officials in both Europe and the United States.Tavakoli is also accused of leading a network linked to attempted attacks in Australia, Greece, Germany, and Mexico.The FBI has released physical details for identification purposes.

It was created after the 1979 Iranian Revolution to protect the new theocratic regime and to act as a counterweight to the regular military. The IRGC now operates its own army, navy, air force and intelligence apparatus, and is highly involved in Iran’s politics, economy and regional security efforts. Its external arm, the Quds Force, supports allied groups and conducts overseas operations. The United States and several other countries have designated parts of the IRGC as a terrorist organisation due to its involvement in violence.","The FBI is seeking information on Saeed Tavakoli, an Iranian national wanted for his alleged association with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) The wanted man goes by the alias Sardar Ammar.

"After power outage, San Francisco wonders: Can robot taxis handle a big quake?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/after-power-outage-san-francisco-wonders-can-robot-taxis-handle-a-big-quake/articleshow/126151163.cms,".





San Francisco officials on Monday called for an investigation into Waymo after its autonomous taxis blocked intersections and snarled traffic during an hourslong power outage over the weekend.The meltdown, which led Waymo to temporarily shut down its entire flee, raised alarms about whether the vehicles might impede evacuations or emergency services during a bigger disaster, such as a major earthquake. ""We haven't seen a situation before where Waymos have stalled en masse across the city,"" said Bilal Mahmood, a San Francisco supervisor who said he would hold a hearing examining Waymo's operations during emergencies. San Francisco is the epicentre of driverless cars in the US, and Waymos in particular have become ubiquitous in the past year, with camera-laden white Jaguars seemingly on every block. Waymo, owned by Google parent company Alphabet, arrived in the tech capital in 2023 and has about 1,000 vehicles roaming its hills and avenues.After initial hesitation, San Franciscans have increasingly grown to rely on the cars. Some women feel safer in a driverless car than in one driven by a man, and parents have been known to use them for school pickups.But Waymo has had a rough go of it recently. One car killed a beloved bodega cat in Oct, causing an uproar. And this weekend's events sparked even more outrage and debate,. It was perhaps the first time Waymo taxis failed on such a wide scale. It was also one of the rare instances, perhaps, where human drivers had a clear advantage over the robots.""They don't have them programmed for when there's a power outage, never mind when there's an earthquake and there's rubble in the street and all the power is out,"" said Jeanine Nicholson, who served as the city fire chief for five years until she retired last year. ""They're still building the plane while they're flying it. Mahmood said stalled Waymo taxis had blocked fire trucks from quickly reaching a burning PG&E substation, which had been one of the causes of the extended outage. After the outage began, Mayor Daniel Lurie's office contacted Waymo about the gridlock its cars were contributing to, and the company agreed to suspend services. Service resumed by Sunday afternoon.It remains unknown exactly why the cars stalled. Some experts speculated the vehicles rely on cell service to communicate with remote operators in emergency situations, and the connections dropped in the outage. Others have said the company may have purposely shut down the cars as it was too risky to have them navigate through so many dead traffic lights.Elon Musk said Tesla Robotaxis, which provide limited services in the city, had been unaffected. (Tesla service is still required to have a human safety monitor on board. Waymo said that while its vehicles are designed to treat nonfunctional signals as four-way stops, ""the sheer scale of the outage led to instances where vehicles remained stationary longer than usual to confirm the state of the affected intersections. .."" It added, ""We are focused on rapidly integrating the lessons learned from the event.""","San Francisco officials call for an investigation into Waymo after its autonomous taxis blocked intersections and snarled traffic during an hourslong power outage.

From civil rights to clickbait: Dave Chappelle’s take on Charlie Kirk comparison with Martin Luther King Jr,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/from-civil-rights-to-clickbait-dave-chappelles-take-on-charlie-kirk-comparison-with-martin-luther-king-jr/articleshow/126150455.cms,"



Comedian Dave Chappelle has forcefully rejected a comparison between conservative commentator Charlie Kirk and civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr, calling the idea exaggerated and fundamentally misguided.In a clip circulating widely on social media, Chappelle responded to claims that Kirk represents a modern equivalent of Dr King. His verdict was blunt, arguing that the comparison stretches credibility far beyond breaking point.Chappelle dismissed the analogy almost immediately, saying that while both figures are well known, the similarities effectively end there. He acknowledged that both men have faced violence, but stressed that shared notoriety or controversy does not place them on the same moral or historical footing.According to Chappelle, equating a digital-era political influencer with a leader of a mass civil rights movement misunderstands what made Dr King significant. “That’s a reach,” he said, a phrase commonly used to describe an argument that is forced or unsupported by reality.At the heart of Chappelle’s critique was the difference between activism shaped by history and activism shaped by algorithms. He described Kirk primarily as an internet personality whose influence depends on provoking reactions and driving engagement online.Chappelle argued that modern online figures often rely on controversy to remain visible, because outrage fuels clicks, views and shares. That dynamic, he suggested, is fundamentally incompatible with the kind of leadership embodied by Dr King, whose work was rooted in grassroots organising, moral persuasion and sustained collective action.To underline the contrast, Chappelle jokingly imagined Dr King adopting the language of modern content creators, urging audiences to “subscribe” or “change my mind”, a comparison that drew laughter while reinforcing his point about the absurdity of the analogy.The episode highlights a broader cultural tension over how historical legacies are invoked in today’s political debates. As social media blurs the line between activism, commentary and entertainment, comparisons to figures such as Martin Luther King Jr increasingly provoke backlash.For Chappelle, the line remains clear. Moral leadership forged in the struggle for civil rights, he suggests, cannot be reduced to viral moments or engagement metrics. In his view, moving “from civil rights to clickbait” is precisely where such comparisons go wrong.",Comedian Dave Chappelle has forcefully rejected a comparison between conservative commentator Charlie Kirk and civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr. He described Kirk primarily as an internet personality whose influence depends on provoking reactions and driving engagement online.

"'Every day, I miss home': Sikh truck driver Arash Singh on struggles of being an immigrant driver in US",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/every-day-i-miss-home-sikh-truck-driver-arash-singh-on-struggles-of-being-an-immigrant-driver-in-us/articleshow/126148322.cms,"Two major accidents caused by Sikh truck drivers

In August, a semi‑truck on the Florida Turnpike attempted an illegal U‑turn and blocked oncoming traffic, causing a minivan to crash into the trailer and killing all three people inside. The driver was a 28-year-old Indian national named Harjinder Singh who had entered US without documentation and obtained a commercial licence in California. He survived the collision. He has been charged with vehicular homicide and manslaughter in connection with the crash, which was captured on vehicle recorder footage.

In October 2025, Jashanpreet Singh, a 21‑year‑old Indian‑origin truck driver from California, was involved in a chain‑reaction crash on Interstate 10 in Ontario, California. Officials said his truck ploughed into slow‑moving traffic, killing three people and injuring others. He was arrested and charged with gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and driving under the influence of drugs.





Arash Singh, a 25-year-old Sikh truck driver, has spent thousands of miles on US highways hauling goods from Washington to California, navigating ice storms, heavy traffic, and occasional harassment because of his turban.“As an immigrant driver,” he told New York Times, “there is plenty you always must think about.”Singh sought asylum in US in 2022 and recently faced the threat of losing his commercial driver licence under new federal rules targeting foreign drivers. California began revoking licences after audits found thousands of commercial licences were improperly issued. Singh received a notice saying he needed proof of permanent residency or citizenship to keep his licence. He has neither, although a federal court has temporarily stayed the rules.The crackdown followed two fatal crashes involving Sikh truck drivers in California and drew criticism from immigrant advocacy groups. US transportation secretary Sean Duffy said the measures aimed to improve safety and compliance among foreign drivers. Democrats and Blue state leaders said the the rules unfairly target legally working immigrants.Sikhs have a long history in American trucking with many settling in California. Today, around 150,000 Sikhs work in the trucking industry in the US, with a quarter of Sikh adults employed in the sector, according to the North American Punjabi Trucking Association.Singh said the work is vital for his family. Most of his earnings go to truck payments and sending money to relatives in India. “Every day, I miss my home, but it’s better here,” he said. “I can work and support my family. It’s safer for me here.”He described the day-to-day challenges of life on the road, including long hours, solitary meals, and adjusting his routine to avoid drawing unecessary attention. However, Singh said he remains committed to driving. “I want to work,” he said.Officials in California, including City Council member Manpreet Kaur, said the policy is creating fear in the trucking community. “People are scared,” she said. “This is yet another immigrant community being targeted.”","Sikhs have a long history in American trucking with many settling in California.
