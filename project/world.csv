PM Modi may meet Iranian president in Russia amid escalating West Asia tensions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/modi-may-meet-iranian-president-in-russia-amid-escalating-west-asia-tensions/articleshow/114410136.cms,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Iranian counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian

Amid escalating Israel-Iran tensions, India and Iran remain in touch diplomatically to finalise a meeting between PM Narendra Modi and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in Russia ’s Kazan this week.If it happens, it will be the first bilateral meeting between the 2 leaders since the reformist president assumed office in July this year.The troubled West Asia situation is expected to figure prominently at the summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin having invited Palestine President Mahmoud Abbas to take part in the meeting.Iran remains closely aligned with Russia on regional and global issues and is also looking to sign a strategic partnership with Moscow during the visit of the president for BRICS. Israel has incapacitated Iran’s allies Hamas and Hezbollah with targeted killings of their top leaders. Iran launched a missile attack on Israel in response on October 1 and the threat of retaliatory strikes by Israel still looms over the region. Speaking about the BRICS summit on Friday, Putin offered to mediate, if asked, and help both sides reach a compromise.Modi had congratulated Pezeshkian on his election as president in July, saying he was looking forward to working closely with him to further strengthen the “warm and long-standing’’ bilateral relationship for the benefit of the people and the region. Logistical constraints prevented a meeting between the leaders at the UNGA last month. If the meeting does take place, Modi can be expected to express concern over loss of civilian lives, seek Gaza ceasefire and underscore the need to prevent the conflict from spilling over into the West Asia region, while also condemning terrorism.Modi had conveyed a similar message to Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu when he spoke to him last month, days after he met Abbas at the UNGA, while backing Israel on the issue of terrorism. India’s tough balancing act is driven by the need to keep its relations with both Israel and Palestine on an even keel.Interestingly, at the BRICS foreign ministers’ meeting this year in Russia, which took place days after the Modi government was sworn in, India joined other member-states in condemning Israel’s military operation in Rafah and in expressing serious concern at Israel’s “continued blatant disregard of international law, the UN Charter, UN resolutions and Court orders”. However, India last month abstained from voting on a UNGA resolution demanding an end to Israel’s “unlawful presence’’ in occupied Palestinian territory that was adopted with 124 votes in favour.","India and Iran remain in touch diplomatically to finalise a meeting between PM Narendra Modi and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian.

BAHRAICH/LUCKNOW: Riot-scarred Maharajganj in UP's Bahraich had an air of resignation to it Sunday as villagers scrambled to salvage whatever they could from their homes and shops, with some voluntarily pulling down portions of their properties marked for demolition by PWD at the end of the initial three-day notice period.Traders hurriedly emptied their shops and tin sheds lay dismantled in a sign of fear hammering down on the neighbourhood of Abdul Hameed - he and three of his sons are suspects in the murder of Ram Gopal Mishra during the October 13 flare-up - well before the bulldozers were to roll in.Notices had been served on 23 homes and shops to vacate the portions of government land they had allegedly encroached by Sunday evening.Hameed's property was among those notified for demolition on Oct 18, five days after that part of Bahraich erupted in communal violence originating from an attack on a Durga Puja immersion procession over the revellers purportedly playing loud music.A senior PWD official said the encroachments were along Kundaasur-Mahsi-Nanpara road in Maharajganj's commercial hub. ""We mentioned in the notice that any construction within 60 feet of the centre of a main road in rural areas without prior approval from PWD is illegal.""According to the notice, owners of all such properties can submit original copies of prior approval from the Bahraich DM or any other authority to the department to save these from demolition.The official said the department had issued notices last year, too, mentioning that encroachment on a road like the Kundasar-Mahsi-Nanpara link causes traffic congestion and delays movement of essential goods to other districts.Station house officer K S Chaturvedi of Hardi police station said Hameed's shop, which stands on the roadside adjacent to his house, was about 40 feet from the middle of the thoroughfare.Another resident in the shop beside Hameed's said he complied with the notice, pulling down an extended shed.Some of the other traders who received notices conceded that they may have encroached on government land, but questioned why those on the opposite side of the road weren't being targeted. Of the 23 residents whose properties are red-listed, three are Hindus - siblings Moon, Nankau and Pappu. They are Hameed's neighbours.","Notices served on 23 homes and shops to vacate portions of government land in Maharajganj. Abdul Hameed's property was among those notified for demolition on Oct 18.

In Feb, two men from Punjab were shot dead in Srinagar.","Two labourers died on the spot, three others and the doctor succumbed to their injuries. Five people are undergoing treatment for injuries.

NEW DELHI: After its shock defeat in Haryana Congress is faced with the unenviable project of picking its new team of functioanries in the state which will signal that the party has learnt its lessons.Sources said Congress has realised the need to throw the net wide to increase its social appeal , amid repeated evidence that its support base has stagnated to the dominant Jat-Jatav combine , while the rest of the communities - Yadavs, Punjabis and Brahmins, among others - are being polarised against it.The defeat under Bhupinder Hooda has served this reminder, which was known in the past, but was overruled as strategists felt anti-incumbency against the governing BJP, around issues of bread-butter, governance, and aspirations, would trump the social considerations.Sources said Congress will decide on the new team by picking a combination - state president and legislature party leader - which would signal an olive branch to the communities outside the party's base. But two crucial considerations make the final decision a tricky issue.While moving forward to widen the social umbrella, the party does not believe it can simply jettison the old team, lest it disturb the existing support base which, even in the losing cause, brought Congress at par with BJP in vote share and also a healthy tally of 37 seats.And, if the dominant faction agrees for a compromise, the testing dimension would be the need to project functionaries from outside the support base who have their own identity, as against ""proxies"" of the old guard with the fig leaf of being from the desired communities that the party is seeking to woo.",Congress has realised the need to throw the net wide to increase its social appeal.

An officer suggested that militants and miscreants may have collaborated to create chaos, possibly exploiting ethnic tensions.Violence in Jiribam came after months of calm in the region, following the outbreak of ethnic clashes in Manipur in May last year. Tensions began in June this year after the killing of a 59-year-old man sparked retaliatory attacks, including the burning of houses belonging to both Meitei and Kuki communities.The recent unrest followed discussions held by the Union home ministry in New Delhi last Tuesday with MLAs from Meitei, Kuki-Zo-Hmar, and Naga communities, aiming to address the ongoing ethnic conflict .","Violence flared in Manipur's Jiribam district as suspected militants set fire to two vacant farmhouses.

Did Hurricane Milton wash ashore a '1700s Ghost Ship' in St. Augustine?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-hurricane-milton-wash-ashore-a-1700s-ghost-ship-in-st-augustine/articleshow/114383291.cms,"Expert Debunks the myth

Can Hurricanes actually cause 'ghost ships' to wash ashore?



(Inputs taken from Pensacola news Journal)

There was a social media buzz on Wednesday with rumours of a “1700s ghost ship” that allegedly washed ashore near St. Augustine , Florida , following Hurricane Milton . Despite several inconsistencies, the story went viral, captivating thousands of users.However, it was eventually debunked as false.The rumour emerged a week after Hurricane Milton made landfall in Florida.Despite the fact that the storm hit on October 9—exactly one week before the alleged sighting—and on the opposite side of the state, the ghost ship story still gained significant traction. The original post amassed over 21,000 shares, with users spreading the narrative widely.As it turns out, the ghost ship tale was a piece of satire. It originated from Casper Planet , a Facebook page known for its humorous and entirely fabricated stories, similar to The Onion.Casper Planet posted a follow-up story on Friday morning titled, “Tourists Outraged After Discovering Non-Existent 1700s Pirate Ship in Florida ‘Wasn’t Real’ All Along.” The page continued to poke fun at the viral spread of the ghost ship narrative.In its initial post, Casper Planet claimed that the ship had “emerged from the ocean’s depths as the Category 4 storm [Hurricane Milton] churned the Atlantic, sending the ancient ship onto the beach.” The dramatic description added a sense of mystery, but it was factually inaccurate. Hurricane Milton had made landfall as a Category 3 storm near Siesta Key, on Florida’s central west coast. It then crossed the state’s peninsula, exiting near Brevard and Indian River counties—over 120 miles from St. Augustine.To lend the story an air of credibility, the page included a fabricated quote from a fictional marine archaeologist named “Dr. Andrew Clarke,” who said, “This is unprecedented. To see a ship this old, in such good condition, simply appear out of the ocean during a hurricane − it’s both fascinating and chilling.”According to First Coast News report, Chuck Meide, director of the Lighthouse Archaeological Maritime Program at the St. Augustine Lighthouse & Museum. Meide debunked the ghost ship claim, explaining that the depiction of the ship was unrealistic.“Most of the wood from a ship hundreds of years old would have been eaten by critters like ship worms,” Meide explained. In cases where parts of such ancient ships do survive, it’s typically the lower portion of the vessel, which gets buried beneath the seafloor.While the ghost ship story was a hoax, there is some truth to the concept of hurricanes washing abandoned ships ashore. In fact, such incidents have occurred in the past.According to Weather.com, a 45-foot ghost ship named Lady Catherine III washed ashore on Pensacola Beach on June 18 during Tropical Storm Alberto. The vessel, battered but still intact, was found with no passengers on board. It was later discovered that the boat belonged to Michael Barlow, a Texas man who had abandoned it earlier that month after encountering the storm.In another instance, a 45-foot sailboat called Cuki broke free from its mooring in Key West during Hurricane Irma in 2017. The boat drifted over 300 miles up Florida’s eastern coast before washing ashore at Spessard Holland South Beach Park. USA Today reported that the boat remained there for two years before it was demolished. Its owner, Jeffrey Sundwall of Key West, was later imprisoned at Jackson Correctional Institute in Malone, Florida, on charges including sexual battery, cocaine possession, obstruction of a criminal investigation, and possession of child pornography.","The rumour emerged a week after Hurricane Milton made landfall in Florida.

NEW DELHI: The AAP on Sunday said the blast near a school in Delhi has exposed the ""crumbling"" law and order in the city and shows that the BJP-led central government is unable to fulfil its responsibility of keeping the Delhiites safe. The BJP spends most of its time obstructing the work of the elected government in Delhi instead, Chief Minister Atishi said in a post on X in Hindi.Responding to the Aam Aadmi Party's allegations, BJP senior leader Vijender Gupta accused AAP of ""playing politics"" and also held Chief Minister Atishi's statement ""irresponsible.""""Playing politics on security issues is the Aam Aadmi Party's habit, and Atishi's irresponsible statements are an attempt to cover up her failures,"" Gupta said.The AAP's tendency to politicise even security issues exposes their mentality, he added.The blast took place near a CRPF school in the Prashant Vihar area on Sunday morning. Though no one was injured in the incident, a wall of the school, nearby shops and a car were damaged, according to police.""The bomb blast outside a school in Rohini exposes the crumbling law and order situation in Delhi,"" Atishi said earlier in the day.""The law and order of Delhi is the responsibility of the BJP-led central government.

Whenever a road is blocked due to construction or waterlogging, you go there with your camera persons but today there was a bomb blast in the city and you are missing,"" he said.The AAP alleged there has been an increase in violent incidents, including gangsters demanding ransom from traders, shootings and murders, in Delhi and called on the BJP to prioritise public safety.In a purported video of the blast circulating on social media, thick white smoke is seen rising above buildings as frantic birds fly over.Forensic experts inspecting the area outside the CRPF school found a suspicious ""white powder"" on the spot and sent it for examination, according to officials.","Aam Aadmi Party accuses BJP-led central government of failing to maintain law and order in Delhi.

Wearing an apron over his suit and tie, the Republican presidential nominee took aim at Kamala Harris ’ long-standing claim of working at the fast-food chain in her college days.With reporters and MAGA aides gathered around, Trump received a crash course in fry-making, eagerly dunking baskets of fries into sizzling oil, salting them, and scooping them into boxes.Trump, a well-known fan of McDonald's, said, ""I don’t even have to touch them with my hands! Incredible!"", grinning as he maneuvered his way around the fry station. “It requires great expertise, actually, to do it right and to do it fast,” he added with a smirk.Trump's impromptu stint behind the counter was more than just a quirky photo op. As Election Day looms just weeks away, the visit was a thinly veiled jab at Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. Harris has spoken about her time working at McDonald's during her college years, a story Trump has repeatedly questioned, dubbing her ""Lyin' Kamala.""Seizing the opportunity, Trump claimed he had worked longer at the McDonald's fry station that day than Harris did during her college stint. “Fifteen minutes longer, believe me!” he said. ""I love McDonald's, I love jobs, and I love seeing good jobs,” he added.But the show didn’t stop at the fry station. Trump, apron still on, took to the drive-thru window for an impromptu press conference, leaning out to answer questions from reporters huddled outside. Asked what message he had for Kamala Harris on her 60th birthday, which coincidentally fell on the same day, Trump said, ""Happy Birthday, Kamala! I think I’ll get her some flowers.""Trump’s fry-slinging tour in the battleground state was part of a broader effort to keep Harris’s McDonald's story in the spotlight, continuing to question the legitimacy of her summer job experience. “I could do this all day,” he boasted, poking fun at the notion of Harris having done the same years ago.As the fast-food spectacle wound down, aides nudged Trump to wrap things up, reminding him of his next campaign stop. With a final flourish, he leaned out of the window and declared, “Wasn’t that a strange place to do a news conference?”Before leaving, Trump, who has often sidestepped questions about minimum wage policies, took a moment to praise the McDonald’s crew. “These people work hard. They’re great. I just saw something … a process that’s beautiful.” He sidestepped directly addressing whether his presidency would support wage increases for those manning the fryers.The former president left Pennsylvania, proving that in Trump’s world, even McDonald’s can be a campaign battlefield.","Donald Trump took over the fry station at a Pennsylvania McDonald's on Sunday.

The petition, which advocates for the protection of the First and Second Amendments, aims to gather one million signatures from voters in key swing states, including Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Arizona.During a town hall in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Musk said, “We are going to be awarding £1 million to randomly selected people who have signed the petition every day from now until the election.” He expressed frustration that mainstream media has largely ignored his campaign, saying, “How do we get people to know about this petition? This news is going to really fly.”During the announcement, Musk also shared the name of the first recipient, John Breyer, who expressed his astonishment, saying, “Thanks, Elon.This is great. I really ecstatic.” Musk clarified that the only requirement for receiving the funds is to act as a spokesperson for the petition.This initiative builds on Musk’s earlier offer of $47 for each registered voter referred to the petition. Launched by Musk's Elon's America PAC, the goal is to gather one million signatures from voters in key swing states, including Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin, and North Carolina. “Our goal is to get 1 million registered voters to sign in support of the Constitution, especially freedom of speech and the right to bear arms,” he added.Musk, a ""mega donor"" for Trump, having donated over $75 million to the former presidents campaign has ramped up his endorsement, holding town halls across Pennsylvania. He had earlier attended rallies alongside Trump, and said that, “This will be the last election if Trump doesn’t win”.While federal law prohibits payment for registering to vote, Musk's strategy remains within legal bounds as it pertains to petition signing.With elections less than 3 weeks out, both Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are mobilising their supporters in key battleground states.

Like Epstein's list, a list of names, all celebrities, with links to P Diddy and his Freak sessions, are doing the rounds on social media.The alleged list contains names of Leonardo Dicaprio , Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Ashton Kutcher, Paris Hilton, Howard Stern, Russell Brand, Mariah Carey, Jennifer Lopez, Russell Simmons, Usher, Meghan Fox. The list goes viral as Usher, Pink deleted their X posts and theories that Justin Bieber might have been a victim of Diddy float around.Nobody has been implicated in the Sean Combs case so far.P Diddy is facing serious charges of sex trafficking and racketeering where he forced women to have sex with male prostitutes that continued for days as the entire action was caught on camera. Huge stocks of baby oil, drugs were found at Diddy's sex den while Diddy did not plead guilty to the charges.Usher who once stayed with Diddy said his X account got hacked and that's why all his past posts disappeared. This happened as his old statement in which said he witnessed wild things when he stayed with Diddy resurfaced.Apart from Usher and Pink, Megan Fox deleted all her posts on Instagram and X triggering speculations over how she was linked to Diddy.An old snipped of Khloe Kardashian claiming that she attended one of Diddy's naked parties emerged. ""I got on a plane at 5:30 am. Well this party...I think half the people there were butt naked,"" this is exactly what Khloe said about Diddy's party.Diddy was Justin Bieber's mentor but Bieber's spokesperson said he is trying not to focus on the charges and accusation of Diddy. Justin is in a happy bubble since he became a father.As the list of the Hollywood A-listers becomes long, they are maintaining absolute silence over Diddy's arrest.An officer involved in the raid on Diddy's home compared him to Jeffrey Epstein, stating that Diddy was part of the same social circle as Epstein and Harvey Weinstein. The officer claimed there were 15 years of wild parties, suggesting that while not everyone who attended was complicit in trafficking, they witnessed inappropriate behavior. He emphasized that many people knew what went on, especially as things became more explicit late at night.Also read on the Diddy case:","No Hollywood A-lister has been implicated in the Sean Diddy trafficking case but several 'Diddy lists' are viral.

Yahya Sinwar's Journey From Israeli Jails To Chief Of Hamas | Who Was He | Watch

Israel has released new footage showing Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in a tunnel under his home just hours before the deadly October 7 attack on Israel. The video, shared by the Israeli Defence Forces ( IDF ), shows Sinwar moving equipment into the underground hideout, preparing for a prolonged stay as Hamas prepared to launch its assault.The grainy footage, which surfaced on Saturday, reveals Sinwar, his wife, and children walking through the tunnel under their home in Khan Younis.IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari commented during a televised briefing, saying, ""You can see how Sinwar and his family members escape to an underground compound just hours before the brutal massacre."" The footage shows Sinwar in a plain t-shirt, accompanied by his family, moving supplies including food, water, mattresses, and even a plasma screen.According to Hagari, the tunnel system was equipped with toilets, showers, and a kitchen, suggesting that Sinwar had prepared for a long-term stay. The underground bunker, hidden beneath his home, was designed to allow him and his family to evade capture, while the attack on Israeli civilians was underway. Sinwar was one of the masterminds behind the October 7 attack that triggered the current war. He had remained in hiding for over a year, evading several Israeli attempts to capture or kill him. Drone footage, released after his death, shows Sinwar injured, throwing an object at the drone in his final moments.Israeli military officials confirmed that Sinwar was killed by a gunshot to the head. The IDF released footage of the tank strike that targeted the building where he was hiding.Sinwar’s death has not slowed the ongoing conflict. As Israeli strikes continue to hit targets across Gaza, the death toll has soared, with over 100 civilians reported dead in recent bombardments. Tensions have escalated with Hezbollah in Lebanon, as both Hamas and Hezbollah vow to continue their fight against Israel.Israel's military has reiterated its commitment to dismantling Hamas, as evidenced by its Saturday leaflet drops over southern Gaza, proclaiming, ""Hamas will no longer rule Gaza."" Meanwhile, international negotiations for a potential ceasefire remain stalled, despite pressure from Western leaders.On October 7, Hamas launched attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border, resulting in at least 1,200 deaths and the abduction of 252 Israelis and foreigners. Of the 97 remaining hostages, over 30 have been confirmed dead.","Footage shows Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in a tunnel under his home just hours before the deadly October 7 attack on Israel.

She has described him as a “despicable narcissist” and frequently expresses concern over his pursuit of power.The contrast between Trump’s light-hearted McDonald’s visit and the serious issues at play in the election has not gone unnoticed. Critics, including Mary Trump, argue that his antics trivialise the hard work of everyday Americans, particularly those in demanding jobs like fast-food service.As the election nears, both candidates are focused on securing votes in crucial states.

TOI Correspondent from Washington: MAGA supremo Donald Trump stopped by at a McDonald's fast food outlet in Pennsylvania on Sunday to make french fries for fifteen minutes and hand them out to his supporters at the drive by window . The showboating exercise was ostensibly aimed at challenging Kamala Harris 's claim that she worked a summer job at McDonald's -- which Trump disputes -- to illustrate her middleclass roots.Dressed in his usual suit even though it was a Sunday, Trump exchanged his jacket for an apron and spent about ten minutes before a fryer as a McDonald's worker handheld him through the process. Through the exercise he was obsessed with belittling ""Lyin' Kamala"" (as he denigrates) saying McDonald's had said in a statements that she had not worked with them. There is no record of McDonald's ever issuing such a statement. ""I've now worked 15 minutes more than Kamala at a McDonald's"" Trump gibed.TV footage showed a few hundred MAGA supporters outside the franchise, a crowd Trump claimed was 10,000 strong. About half a dozen customers, all of them clearly Trump supporters -- including an Indian couple -- drove by the pick up window to collect orders, which Trump said was free courtesy him.The grandstanding invited ridicule from trolls on social media who joked about his wearing a suit to McDonald's and said he is so clumsy he'd be fired in 15 minutes if he really worked there. ""He’s been shitting in a gold toilet since birth- he doesn’t represent you. He doesn’t care about you,"" mocked one critic, while another called him a rich plutocrat feeling left out.", MAGA supremo Donald Trump stopped by at a McDonald's fast food outlet in Pennsylvania on Sunday to make french fries for fifteen minutes and hand them out to his supporters.

HYDERABAD: In a public rally on Friday, leading Pakistpolitician Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari warned that if political parties in parliament do not reach a consensus on the 26th constitutional amendment , he will push the amendment through parliament using a brute, or two-thirds majority, Dawn reported. Bilawal Bhutto Zardari is the chairperson of the Pakistan People's Party which is led by his father Asif Ali Zardari who is the President of Pakistan.Pakistan People's Party ( PPP ) is in coalition with PM Shehbaz Sharif 's Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML-N). These two parties along with Fazlur Rehman's Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI-F) have come together to implement the 26th constitutional amendment in Pakistan's constitution.While addressing a PPP rally in Pakistan's Hyderabad city to mark the anniversary of the attack on his mother's homecoming parade in 2007, Bilawal Bhutto said, ""It is my desire to have consensus among all political parties in parliament for this amendment. The second option, which is not my preferred path, is to rely on the majority's vote to pass it,"" Dawn noted.He urged political parties to consider the future and work towards raising the dignity of parliament, adding that they operate within a certain ""political space"".Bhutto noted that while the PPP was unable to establish a constitutional court during its 2008-2013 government, he is committed to fulfilling the promise made by Benazir Bhutto.He acknowledged opposition to the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), particularly fromPTI leaders, but insisted that the new court would ensure equal representation for all provinces.PTI has been protesting across Pakistan against the implementation of the constitutional amendments as the Party alleges that the bill would undermine the powers of judiciary.PTI leaders have also alleged that bribes up to Rs 1 Billion are being offered to lawmakers to garner support for passing the amendment law.In the public rally, Bilawal Bhutto gave out historical justifications for implementation of the 26th amendment saying that even Muhammad Ali Jinnah had called for a separate court for routine justice matters at the 1930 Round Table Conference.The FCC, Bhutto claimed, would protect the rights of provinces by providing equal representation and addressing disputes between the federation and provinces.As per Dawn, Bhutto insisted that his mother and former Pakistan PM Benazir Bhutto had supported the establishment of the FCC because she understood the ""real face"" of the judiciary, which he said had repeatedly legitimised dictatorial rule.""After abolishing the 'One Unit' system in the country through parliament, my mother wanted to eliminate the concept of 'One Unit' in the judiciary as well,"" he added.",Bilawal Bhutto Zardari is the chairperson of the Pakistan People's Party.

NEW DELHI: Police in Pakistan used tear gas and batons to disperse student protesters on Thursday after they ransacked a college building. The protests erupted over an alleged on-campus rape in Lahore that has sparked anger and demonstrations in four cities.Reports of the incident spread on social media, increasing tensions on college campuses. Students in Rawalpindi, Punjab province, burned furniture and blocked a key road before vandalizing a college building.Earlier, a security guard died during clashes between student protesters and police in Gujrat, also in Punjab province. Authorities arrested one person related to the guard's death and another for spreading misinformation about the alleged rape.In Lahore, over two dozen students were injured earlier this week while demanding justice for the alleged victim, who students claim was raped at the Punjab Group of Colleges.In response to the growing unrest, the government banned rallies in Punjab. The Federal Investigation Agency filed cases against 36 people accused of spreading misinformation on social media.Authorities, including the Punjab chief minister, and the woman’s parents denied any assault happened. However, Punjab police called on the public to share any information regarding the alleged rape.The unrest seems to have started spontaneously, as student unions in Pakistan have been banned since 1984.These protests also come after a woman reported being gang-raped during a polio vaccination drive in Sindh province last month. Police arrested three men involved, but the woman's husband expelled her from home, citing damage to the family name.","Protests erupted over an alleged on-campus rape in Lahore that has sparked anger.

Pakistan's Punjab CM blames PTI party

Senior directors of a Pakistan college stated on Wednesday that there was no evidence to support claims of a student being raped on campus, despite reports circulating online that led to several days of protests. The allegations, which spread through social media posts, claimed that a woman was raped in the basement of a Punjab College for Women campus in Lahore .In response to the posts, hundreds of students, mostly male, engaged in protests that involved smashing windows and burning school buses. These demonstrations reflect a growing concern in Pakistan regarding safety, harassment, and sexual violence.Arif Chaudry, the Lahore director of the private Punjab Group of Colleges , which operates the women's college, was quoted by AFP during a press conference saying, ""The incident does not exist. I will resign and I will leave this profession and stand with the students if the incident took place.""Another director of the group, Agha Tahir Ijaz, urged students not to believe misinformation during the same news conference.As the anger grew over the alleged incident, police arrested a security guard who was identified in the online posts. However, they reported that no victim had come forward and that they were unable to verify the incident.The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) cybercrime wing has initiated an investigation targeting individuals responsible for disseminating the information via social media channels which is now claimed to be false.The protests, which began at two of the college's campuses on Monday afternoon, quickly spread to several other colleges throughout the city and continued for three days and resulted in injuries to at least 28 people.As the college denied the claims, Maryam Nawaz , the chief minister of Pakistan's Punjab also addressed the alleged rape incident, asserting that the accusations were 'fabricated'.Nawaz further claimed that the political party led by Imran Khan , Pakistan's former prime minister who is currently imprisoned, exploited the false allegation to provoke extensive student demonstrations and cause instability throughout the province.The Punjab government has closed the college campus where the alleged rape was said to have occurred until further notice. ""On social media, a factory of lies is running.
