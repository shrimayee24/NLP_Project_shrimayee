Despite the recent show of bonhomie between PM Narendra Modi and President Donald Trump, India and the US again seemed at odds over talks between the leaders as the Indian government denied that they discussed Pakistan in Trump’s Diwali phone call to Modi.It’s also learnt that India is exploring the possibility of Modi addressing the Asean/ East Asia summit meetings in Malaysia virtually later this week, apparently because of the elections in Bihar. This would rule out any likelihood in the near future of an in-person encounter with Trump. The US president said this week he will be in Malaysia for the annual event. He is unlikely to travel though to South Africa for the G20 summit next month, where Modi will be present.Modi has rarely skipped in-person participation in the Asean/ East Asia summit meetings. The PM had earlier this month declined Egypt’s invitation for the Gaza peace summit that was co-chaired by Trump. India has not been enthused by the prospect of a meeting with Trump in the absence of any breakthrough in the trade negotiations, as also the president’s claims ad nauseam about having ended a war between India and Pakistan, but government sources said the likely decision to opt out of in-person participation may also be related to the focus on Bihar elections Trump said at a Diwali event on Tuesday that he had spoken to Modi and that they had also discussed the need to avoid a war between India and Pakistan. The PM had later in a post on X expressed hope that the 2 countries will stand united against terrorism in all its forms, venting India’s concerns about Islamabad’s growing proximity with Washington under Trump but without naming Pakistan.“Pakistan was not discussed during the phone call between the PM and President Trump,” said a source here, on condition of anonymity.This was the second time in the past 2 weeks that India has denied Trump’s claim that he has tagged to conversations with Modi. India had said last week it wasn’t aware of the conversation between Modi and Trump during which, according to Trump, the Indian PM assured him India would stop buying oil from Russia.The India-US relationship has been making headlines because of the differences over trade but Trump’s unabashed courting of Pakistan has also been a source of unease in bilateral ties for India. Even as India maintains that the ceasefire after Operation Sindoor in May was directly negotiated between the 2 militaries, Trump has not backed down from his claim that he ended the conflict with his threat to impose trade tariffs on India and Pakistan. The relationship saw a dramatic downturn after Modi declined Trump’s invitation in June this year to visit the White House. The visit was always a non-starter for Modi, as Pakistan army chief Asim Munir was also being feted there at the same time.",India and the US again seemed at odds over talks between the leaders as the Indian government denied that they discussed Pakistan in Trump’s Diwali phone call to Modi.

She later prayed at nearby shrines of Vavaraswamy and Malikappuram. Before leaving, TDB officials presented her with an idol of Lord Ayyappa.President Murmu’s visit holds comes years after the Sabarimala temple became the centre of intense debate and protests over women’s entry. In 2018, the Supreme Court had ruled that women of all ages could enter the shrine, overturning the traditional ban on those between 10 and 50 years of age, as Lord Ayyappa is worshipped as a(perennial celibate). The verdict had triggered widespread opposition from devotees and sparked a political and social divide in Kerala.Murmu’s pilgrimage conducted strictly within temple customs and age-old rituals is being seen as a moment of quiet symbolism. BJP leader Bandi Sanjay Kumar praised her visit on X, writing, “She is 67. She broke no rules, hurt no faith, she only honoured it. In doing so, she became the first president ever to carry theand bow before Lord Ayyappa. Her visit reminds us that devotion doesn’t shout; it simply stands tall. A moment that reflects the deep faith uniting millions of Ayyappa devotees across India. Those 18 steps have seen debate and defiance, yet devotion always finds its dignity.”",President Droupadi Murmu is the first woman head of state to visit the temple.

NC has nominated Aga Mehmood as its candidate. However, its Srinagar MP, Aga Ruhullah Mehdi, has said he would not campaign for the party. “My loyalty is to my conscience and principles,” Mehdi said.

He said Mehdi’s rise, from being elected thrice as an MLA from Budgam to becoming an MP from Srinagar constituency, was possible only because the party gave him the mandate to contest.Mehdi is unhappy with NC’s stance on Article 370, accusing the party of abandoning its principled position on its restoration.He is also critical of the party over its approach to reservations in govt jobs and admissions to professional institutions.

It is clearly a case of foul play,” the complainant said.He claimed they intended to have him jailed or even killed, saying, “I believe they are trying to frame me in a false case… Their plan is to get me imprisoned or killed, but so far, they haven’t succeeded.”The case was registered under sections 103(1) (murder) and 61 (criminal conspiracy) at MDC police station in Panchkula.Another video surfaced on Tuesday in which Aqil reportedly said he had suffered from schizophrenia but praised his family for supporting him.In the video, he added: “…let’s see what happens…they get me killed or not,” though his face was largely hidden. Aqil also claimed that his family had tried to portray him as mentally unstable.Mustafa has dismissed the allegations, ""I welcome registration of the FIR and setting up of an SIT. That is the first step police ought to follow. I have nothing to hide. Based on a postmortem conducted by police, it was said that death was due to drug overdose. I also suspect the same,” he told the press.The former DGP added that Aqil had a history of drug use and that the statements he made in earlier videos were under the influence of drugs. Aqil was found dead in his room on 16 October. The family initially believed he had died from a drug overdose. No external injuries were found in the post-mortem, and viscera samples have been sent for further analysis, authorities said.The police have said a thorough investigation is ongoing to determine the exact cause of death.","A murder case has been registered against former Punjab DGP Md Mustafa, his wife Razia Sultana, a former minister, and their daughter-in-law and daughter.

GUWAHATI: Train services on the Alipurduar Division of Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR) were briefly disrupted early Thursday morning following a massive blast on the railway track between Salakati and Kokrajhar in Assam ’s Bodoland Territorial Region.The blast, believed to have been caused by an improvised explosive device (IED), blew up portions of the track.An NFR official said the incident occurred around 1:00 am when the UP Azara Sugar goods train was passing through the section. The train manager reported a sudden and heavy jerk, prompting an emergency halt.Upon inspection, railway personnel discovered damage to the track and sleepers, suspected to have been caused by an IED.Security forces, including the Railway Protection Force (RPF), Assam Police, and intelligence agencies, rushed to the site and launched a full-scale investigation. While no casualties were reported, the blast led to the detention of at least eight trains, causing temporary disruption of services.NFR officials confirmed that restoration work was completed by 5:25 am, and normal train operations resumed shortly thereafter. Patrolling has been intensified across the section to ensure safety and prevent further incidents.“We are treating this as a serious security breach. All agencies are coordinating to identify the perpetrators and ensure the safety of passengers and railway assets,” said a senior NFR official.The incident has raised concerns over the vulnerability of critical infrastructure in the region, especially in light of past insurgent activities. Authorities are yet to confirm the motive or the group behind the suspected attack. No outfit has claimed responsibility so far, and security agencies are investigating to determine who could be behind the blast.Further updates are awaited as the investigation progresses.","Train services on the Alipurduar Division of Northeast Frontier Railway were briefly disrupted early Thursday morning.

BELAGAVI: Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah 's son Yathindra Siddaramaiah's statement on Wednesday that his father was at the fag end of his political life and Minister Satish Jarkiholi is a leader with similar progressive ideological thinking, has led to speculation, amid talks about leadership change.However, later speaking to reporters, the Congress MLC ruled out any talks about leadership change.Meanwhile, Deputy Chief Minister D K Shivakumar, who is seen as the prime contender for CM post, in case of change of guard, not wanting to comment on Yathindra's statement, said he is committed to his earlier statement that he and Siddaramaiah will work together, abiding by the party's direction.There have been speculation about the CM change in the state when the Congress government reaches the halfway mark of its five-year term in November, which is being referred to by some as ""November revolution"".""He (Siddaramaiah) is at the fag end of his political life. At such a time, a leader is needed to guide and lead those who have progressive thinking, ideologically,"" Yathindra said.Addressing a gathering at Chikkodi here, he expressed hope that Jarkiholi will take over such a responsibility, and will be a role model to all those politicians and young leaders who believe in Congress party's ideology, and lead them.""It is difficult to have leaders who are committed to principles, but Jarkiholi is doing his job with commitment.He should continue to do so,"" he added.This statement by Yathindra, had led to speculation in the media, whether he and the Siddaramaiah camp were trying to project Jarkiholi, a senior leader from the ST community, as a possible contender for the CM post, in case of leadership change.Later speaking to reporters, Yathindra said the leadership change issue has not come up for discussion. AICC general secretary in-charge of Karnataka Randeep Singh Surjewala too has clarified on this. ""Remaining everything is speculation.""He did not wish to comment on a question on the Cabinet reshuffle.Responding to a question on Yathindra's comments, Shivakumar, who was on a visit to Raghavendra Swamy math in Andhra Pradesh's Mantralaya, speaking to reporters in Raichur, said, ""You (media) ask him (Yathindra) about what he has said.

What Siddaramaiah and I have said -- we will abide by the party direction and work together. I'm committed to it.""Amid talks about CM change, Siddaramaiah has constantly reiterated that he will complete a full five years term.There was stiff competition between Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar for the chief minister's post after the declaration of Assembly election results in May 2023, and the Congress had managed to convince the latter and made him the Deputy CM.There were some reports at the time that a compromise had been reached based on a ""rotational chief minister formula,"" according to which Shivakumar will become CM after two-and-half years, but they have not been officially confirmed by the party.","Yathindra Siddaramaiah's statement on Wednesday that his father was at the fag end of his political life has led to speculation, amid talks about leadership change.

DHAKA: Bangladesh International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) on Wednesday sent 15 serving army officers to jail to face trial on charges of enforced disappearances, murders and custodial tortures during former PM Sheikh Hasina ’s tenure. The officers were taken into custody by the army on Oct 11 after a special tribunal ordered their arrest in cases of atrocities linked to the Taskforce for Interrogation Cell and the Joint Interrogation Cell.The tribunal did not hear any bail petitions, noting there is a formal process for such petitions, and the officers could submit formal applications before the next hearing on Nov 5, chief prosecutor Tajul Islam told reporters. “The Bangladesh army has extended cooperation to the judicial process,” he said. Defence counsel M Sarwar Hossain said the accused would be kept in a sub-jail inside the cantonment.ICT is also likely to set the date for delivering its verdict in ‘crimes against humanity’ cases— committed last year — filed against Hasina, former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal and former police IG Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun. Prosecutor Mizanul Islam said the state-appointed counsel for Hasina and Khan, as well as the defence lawyer representing approver Mamun, concluded their arguments on Wednesday.","The officers were taken into custody by the army on Oct 11 after a special tribunal ordered their arrest.

The US military carried out its ninth strike against an alleged drug-smuggling vessel on Wednesday, destroying the boat and killing three people in the eastern Pacific Ocean, US defence secretary Pete Hegseth announced.Sharing a video of the strike on social media, Hegseth said the vessel, part of a known narco-trafficking route, was carrying drugs.Three suspected narco-terrorists were killed in international waters, with no US casualties. It was the second Pacific strike in as many days as part of ongoing US anti-narcotics operations.""Today, at the direction of President Trump , the Department of War carried out yet another lethal kinetic strike on a vessel operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization (DTO). Yet again, the now-deceased terrorists were engaged in narco-trafficking in the Eastern Pacific,"" Hegseth said through a post on X.Wednesday’s strike followed one the previous night in the eastern Pacific that killed two people, Hegseth said.Unlike the seven earlier US attacks concentrated in the Caribbean, the back-to-back strikes mark an expansion of operations into the waters off South America, a key corridor for cocaine shipments from the world’s largest producers.The recent attacks have killed at least 37 people since the campaign began last month.In his social media posts, Hegseth drew parallels between the Trump administration’s anti-narcotics offensive and the US “war on terror” launched after the September 11, 2001 attacks.""These strikes will continue, day after day. These are not simply drug runners—these are narco-terrorists bringing death and destruction to our cities. These DTOs are the “Al Qaeda” of our hemisphere and will not escape justice. We will find them and kill them, until the threat to the American people is extinguished,"" Hegseth said.Trump has defended the strikes, claiming the US is in an “armed conflict” with drug cartels under the same legal authority used by the Bush administration after 9/11.Asked about the latest attack, Trump said, “we have legal authority. We’re allowed to do that,” adding that similar strikes could eventually target land operations.“We will hit them very hard when they come in by land,” Trump told reporters, as cited by AP. “We’re totally prepared to do that. And we’ll probably go back to Congress and explain exactly what we’re doing when we come to the land.”Lawmakers from both parties have raised concerns that Trump is ordering these military strikes without congressional authorization or sufficient transparency about the operations.","Three suspected narco-terrorists were killed in international waters, with no US casualties.

Who is Chandler Langevin ? Why is he in the news?



'It's unacceptable and dangerous'







Florida councilman Chandler Langevin who called for a mass deportation of Indians from the US, mocked Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi after the Indian-origin Congressman denounced Langevin's hate speech. Calling Krishnamoorthi a 'foreign occupier', Langevin said Krishnamoorthi's name is unpronounceable and his country of origin is Tatooine, a Star Wars location.Chandler Langevin is a city councilmember in Florida who has been making a series of derogatory comments against Indians and callin for their mass deportation . He said Indians are draining America and they only want to benefit their home country. Indian-American groups of Palm Bay Council protested his remarks and called for his ouster from the city council.The city council took up the issue and a vote was held in which it was passed 3-2 that Langevin would be censured. “We’re all overwhelmed by everything. This nation was founded on immigrants … We are all part of the very fabric of the flag, our banner, the United States of America,"" Mayor Rob Medina, who also serves on the council, said.Hindus for Human Rights, a national advocacy organization, released a letter calling the remarks “overtly bigoted, dehumanizing, and dangerous” and urged the Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, to suspend Langevin from his role.Langevin, however, refused to apologize for his statements and doubled down on what he said.He said he is not the first Republican to make a mean tweet and he meant to start a discourse on immigration. He also said that his target was not the Indian-Americans settled in the country and contibuting to the country but the migrants.Democratic leader and US representative for Illinois's 8th congressional district Raja Krishnamoorthi issued a statement condemning the recent remarks by Langevin. “It’s unacceptable—and dangerous—that in 2025 we’re hearing elected officials call for the mass removal of Indian Americans. This rhetoric echoes the cruelty of Donald Trump’s mass ICE raids and fuels a climate of fear that harms families across our nation. When hate speech is normalized and communities are scapegoated, our democracy is weakened,"" Krishnamoorthi said.Langevin reacted to Krishnamoorthi's statement by reporting him to the DHS as a 'foreign occupier' whose name is unpronounceable.",Chandler Langevin is a city councilmember in Florida who has been making a series of derogatory comments against Indians and callin for their mass deportation.

What happens next





When a California mother discovered that her 11-year-old daughter had been socially transitioned to a boy by school staff without her knowledge, she turned to the courts for answers. Two years later, a federal appeals court has revived her lawsuit, ruling that the lower court wrongly dismissed her claims. The decision marks a significant moment in the ongoing national debate over parental rights, student privacy, and school gender policies — an issue now drawing attention well beyond California’s borders.The case, Regino v. Staley, was filed by Aurora Regino in January 2023 against the Chico Unified School District (CUSD) and Superintendent Kelly Staley. Regino alleges that school officials at Sierra View Elementary allowed her daughter, identified as A.S. in court documents, to adopt a male name and pronouns at school without informing her family.According to filings, this occurred under a district policy that required parental notification only with the student’s consent, effectively preventing parents from being told about a child’s declared gender identity if the child objected.Regino argues that this policy violated her constitutional right to direct the upbringing and welfare of her child under the Fourteenth Amendment.After Regino’s lawsuit was dismissed by U.S. District Judge John Mendez in July 2023, she appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. In April 2025, the appellate panel reversed the dismissal, stating that the lower court had “applied an incorrect legal standard” by requiring pre-existing precedent to recognise the parental right in question.The Ninth Circuit wrote that while no identical precedent existed, the right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children was “long recognised under constitutional due process.” The case was sent back to the lower court for further proceedings.In its opinion, the panel stopped short of ruling on the constitutionality of the school district’s policy, instead clarifying that Regino’s claims were substantial enough to merit a full hearing.The decision has been hailed by Regino’s legal team at the Liberty Justice Center, a nonprofit public-interest law firm, as a victory for parental rights.“This ruling restores a critical safeguard for families,” said Emily Rae, an attorney representing Regino. “Parents, not bureaucrats, have the right to make major decisions about their children’s identities and wellbeing.”The Chico Unified School District, in a statement to the media, said it would continue to “follow state and federal guidelines on student confidentiality” while defending its policy in court. “Our staff are committed to creating a safe environment for all students,” the statement added, emphasising that the district’s actions were consistent with California’s educational code and anti-discrimination laws.Legal analysts describe the Ninth Circuit’s decision as one of the first appellate-level rulings allowing a parental-rights challenge to proceed in the context of school gender policies. While the ruling does not determine liability, it opens the door for courts to weigh how far public schools can go in supporting students’ gender transitions without parental consent.The decision could also influence similar lawsuits filed in Massachusetts, Maryland, and Wisconsin, where parents have made comparable claims. It adds to a growing divide between states adopting student privacy protections for gender identity and those advancing parental notification laws.“Courts are now being asked to navigate an emerging conflict between two constitutional values: the right to privacy and the right of parents to direct their children’s upbringing,” said Professor Neal Devins, a constitutional law scholar at William & Mary Law School. “This case underscores the need for clearer legal guidance as these policies proliferate across districts.”According to Regino’s complaint, her daughter confided to a school counsellor in 2022 that she “felt like a boy.” Without consulting Regino, the counsellor began referring to the child by a male name and pronouns in class and correspondence. Regino said she only learned about it months later, when her daughter mentioned the new identity at home.“I was shocked,” Regino told reporters in 2023. “No one at the school ever called me, met with me, or even told me this was happening. As a mother, I had the right to know.”The case quickly gained national attention, with critics arguing that such policies undermine parents, while supporters claim they protect vulnerable children from potential harm or rejection at home.California law currently gives schools discretion on whether to inform parents about a student’s gender identity, with several districts adopting confidentiality rules to protect student privacy. The California Department of Education maintains that these policies comply with state anti-discrimination standards.Conservative legal groups, however, have framed the issue as a question of parental authority and transparency, warning that secrecy undermines family trust. Civil liberties advocates counter that forced disclosure could endanger transgender and questioning youth, particularly in unsupportive households.The Ninth Circuit’s ruling does not take a side in that policy debate but reaffirms that such questions belong before a court, not dismissed on procedural grounds.The case now returns to Judge Mendez’s courtroom in the Eastern District of California for a renewed hearing on the merits. Both sides are expected to file updated briefs later in 2025.If Regino ultimately prevails, the decision could reshape how schools nationwide handle gender identity disclosures to parents. Conversely, if the district’s policy is upheld, it could reinforce the principle of student autonomy in gender matters under school care.For now, the Ninth Circuit’s message is clear: the question of who decides what children are told, and when parents should be informed, is not settled — and deserves a full hearing in court.","Aurora Regino filed a lawsuit in January 2023 against the Chico Unified School District (CUSD) and Superintendent Kelly Staley.

Several videos showing cops and firefighters dousing fireworks on Diwali night surfaced on social media, claiming that this happened in New Jersey this year. The fireworks were stopped after 10 pm, the claims said, though there is no official confirmation on these claims and exactly what happened.The videos went viral as some supported what the police did, and some blamed Indians for earning a bad name everywhere they go. But some users claimed that the cops were not stopping the celebrations but only dousing skyshots that were not allowed.""Diwali celebration was fully permitted by the state, and fireworks were officially allowed. All safety measures like roadblocks, ambulance & fire brigade were arranged by the city. Someone from the crowd suddenly lit skyshots which weren’t allowed, so the fire brigade sprayed water only for safety — not to stop Diwali,"" one wrote. There is no confirmation about this either.""Its misleading, fire department was present there for any emergency. And after the celebration actually they helped the residents in cleaning the roads,"" another explained.The comment sections of these viral videos were divided -- many supported what the police apparently did, while many asked whether this would be done on Christmas and New Year's Eve also.Diwali is celebrated in many US states, and New Jersey is one of them. The BAPS Swaminarayan Akshardham Temple in Robbinsville, New Jersey, put up a spectacular fireworks display this time.Though Diwali is celebrated every year in many US states, it became a major flashpoint this year as several MAGA supporters openly spread hate, slammed Hindus and even targeted the Indian-American politicians of the Republican Party. This came in the backdrop of the Trump administration cracking down on the H-1B visa program that allows US companies to hire foreign employees.","Videos claiming that New Jersey police stopped Diwali celebration went viral.

I just spoke to your Prime Minister today. Had a great conversation. We talked about trade... He's very interested in that. Although we did talk a little while ago about let's have no wars with Pakistan. The fact that trade was involved, I was able to talk about that. And we have no war with Pakistan and India. That was a very, very good thing. He's a great person, and he's become a great friend of mine over the years,"" Trump said.Trump highlighted the symbolic significance of Diwali, noting that lighting the diya represents the triumph of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil.

Pakistan And Afghanistan Agree To ‘Immediate Ceasefire’ After Peace Talks In Doha

Pakistan and Afghanistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire after several days of deadly cross-border clashes, Qatar’s foreign ministry said on Sunday. The announcement came after at least 10 people were killed in Pakistani airstrikes that followed an earlier truce.“During the negotiations, the two sides agreed to an immediate ceasefire and the establishment of mechanisms to ensure lasting peace and stability between the two countries,” Qatar’s ministry of foreign affairs said in a statement.Officials from both sides met in Doha on Saturday to ease tensions. Kabul had earlier accused Islamabad of breaking a 48-hour ceasefire that briefly paused nearly a week of fighting which killed dozens of soldiers and civilians on both sides.Security officials in Pakistan said the latest strikes in Afghan border areas targeted a militant group linked to the Pakistani Taliban. The attack, they said, came in response to an assault on Pakistani paramilitary forces.Pakistan’s delegation in Doha includes defence minister Khawaja Asif and intelligence chief general Asim Malik, while the Afghan side is led by defence minister Mohammad Yaqoob, the Taliban said.Violence erupted on October 11, just days after explosions in Kabul during a rare visit by Taliban foreign minister Amir Muttaqi to India.

Pakistan's field marshal Asim Munir has yet again engaged in anti-India rhetoric issuing veiled nuclear and economic threats while claiming that the ""misconceived"" immunity of India's geographic vastness will be shattered by the reach and lethality of their weapon systems.Speaking at the Pakistan military academy in Abbotabad (where Osama Bin Laden lived and was killed by the US) on Saturday, the rabble-rouser army chief threatened that a response far beyond the expectations of the initiators (India/Afghanistan) can be expected, if a fresh wave of hostilities is triggered.""With diminishing distinction between combat and communication zones, the reach and lethality of our weapon systems will shatter the misconceived immunity of India's geographic vastness,"" he added.He cautioned and advised the India's military leadership that there is no space for war in a nuclearised environment.

Also read:

What's happening?





Also read:

Operation Sindoor and the Muridke connection





A state at war with itself





An imploding picture









“You can’t keep snakes in your backyard and expect them only to bite your neighbours.”External affairs minister S Jaishankar issued a stern warning to Pakistan at the United Nations in 2022. Three years later, Pakistan is yet to mend its ways, and the warning rings truer than ever. Then, both leaders accused Pakistan of nurturing terror groups for strategic leverage. Now, the country is confronting the full consequences of that strategy.Pakistan is in turmoil at all fronts, and at the centre of the latest crisis lies Muridke - the same city India struck during Operation Sindoor , a swift 22-minute campaign that targeted terror hubs including Markaz Taiba, the headquarters of Lashkar-e-Taiba.This week, Muridke is again in the spotlight as it turned volatile after Pakistan’s law enforcement cracked down on a protest camp organised by Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP). The government action has triggered violent clashes, arrests, and growing instability across the region.In a move dripping with irony, the provincial chief minister chaired what her office called an ""extraordinary"" meeting, ordering arrests of ""extremist leaders"" and seizure of assets linked to the same group once courted by the establishment.Over 2,700 people have been detained, and Section 144 has been imposed across Punjab, banning gatherings and protests.Mosques associated with the TLP have been sealed, its social media accounts suspended, and its top brass is being added to Pakistan’s Fourth Schedule—a list of individuals suspected of terrorism or sectarianism.Officials have also announced plans to recommend a federal ban on the party, freeze its assets, and prosecute its leaders under anti-terror laws. AI tools are being deployed to track wanted individuals.Authorities say the TLP’s so-called ""Gaza solidarity"" march to Islamabad had turned, as one official put it, ""bloody as always.""The timing and geography of the crackdown are significant. Muridke was among the nine key sites targeted during Operation Sindoor in May following the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians.During the four-day campaign, the Indian Air Force destroyed at least six Pakistani fighter jets, two high-value surveillance aircraft, a C-130 transport plane, over ten drones, several cruise missiles, and radar installations.One of its central objectives was Markaz Taiba, Lashkar-e-Taiba’s nerve centre in Muridke — just 25 km from the International Border. The facility, built with donations reportedly including Rs 10 lakh from Osama bin Laden, trained the 26/11 Mumbai attackers.For decades, Pakistan’s national security doctrine rested on militant proxies—to gain ""strategic depth"" against India and influence over Afghanistan. That policy has now imploded.Islamabad is fighting multiple insurgencies at once - from the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) in Balochistan, and even rogue Taliban factions across the Durand Line.According to the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), more than 2,400 security personnel have been killed in 2025 so far—the bloodiest year since 2015. The violence is now driven by what analysts call a ""Quad of Terror"": the TTP, Baloch insurgents, Islamic State–Khorasan (IS-K), and Taliban breakaway groups.Since the Taliban’s 2021 takeover of Kabul, Pakistan’s western frontier has unravelled. The TTP, long sheltered in Afghanistan, now launches near-daily attacks. The BLA targets Chinese projects in Gwadar and convoys in Balochistan. Despite repeated military operations, the insurgency only appears to be deepening.Drone strikes, air raids, and mass arrests have failed to stem the violence. Meanwhile, reports of enforced disappearances, civilian casualties, and militarisation have eroded public trust, especially in Balochistan.The TLP ban, border tensions with Afghanistan, and the fallout of Operation Sindoor together expose a grim truth that India has warned of several times: Pakistan’s long experiment with extremism has backfired catastrophically.When Hillary Clinton stood beside then-foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar, in 2011 and delivered the ""snakes in your backyard"" warning, it was a diplomatic metaphor. Today, it's Pakistan's reality.What began as a policy of control has spiralled into a crisis of survival. Pakistan's greatest threat is no longer at its borders: it's the legacy of its own choices.","Pakistan cracked down on a protest camp organised by Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) The government action has triggered violent clashes, arrests, and growing instability across the region.

Fierce Border Clash Between Pakistan, Afghanistan Intensifies With Tanks, Shelling, High Casualties

Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif on Friday said that his country can no longer maintain its past relations with Afghanistan, alleging, without evidence, that the Taliban leadership is ""sitting in India’s lap"" and warning of a ""heavy price"" for cross-border terrorism, signalling a public hardening of Islamabad’s stance toward a regime it once helped install.His comments came after at least six people, including two children, were killed and seven others injured in airstrikes conducted by Pakistan in Afghanistan’s southeastern Paktika province. The strikes reportedly violated a recent ceasefire agreement between the two countries. Media reports said that representatives from both sides are expected to meet in Doha, Qatar, to address the situation.""Pakistan can no longer afford to maintain relations with Kabul as it did in the past,"" Asif said in a social media post.""All Afghans residing on Pakistani soil must return to their homeland; they now have their own government/caliphate in Kabul... Our land and resources belong to 250 million Pakistanis,"" he added.""Self-respecting nations do not thrive on foreign land and resources,"" Asif said.He stated that despite Pakistan’s efforts and sacrifices over the past five years, Kabul has not responded positively. ""Pakistan issued 836 protest notes to the Afghan side and another 13 demarches,"" he said.Asif warned that Pakistan will now respond more strongly to acts of terrorism. ""There will no longer be protest notes or appeals for peace; no delegations will go to Kabul. Wherever the source of terrorism lies, it will have to pay a heavy price,"" he said.He also alleged that Afghanistan has become a ""proxy of India"" and is working with New Delhi and the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) against Islamabad.""The rulers of Kabul, who are now sitting in India’s lap and conspiring against Pakistan, were once under our protection, hiding on our land,"" Asif said, without providing any evidence for his claim.Earlier this week, MEA Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal, while addressing the weekly press briefing, said that Pakistan is habituated in blaming its neighbours for its internal problems. ""On the developments that are happening on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, we are closely monitoring the situation three things are clear. One, Pakistan hosts terrorist organisations and sponsors terrorist activities. Two, it is an old practice of Pakistan to blame its neighbors for its own internal failures. And three, Pakistan is infuriated with Afghanistan exercising sovereignty over its own territories. India remains fully committed to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Afghanistan,"" he had said.The Pakistan defense minister reiterated that Pakistan is prepared to defend itself against any aggression from Afghanistan.Earlier this week, Asif said that Pakistan is ready to respond if the Afghan Taliban ""wish for war."" Speaking to Samaa TV, he said, ""Pakistan remains ready for any aggression; no one should harbour doubt.""Islamabad has repeatedly called on the Taliban government to ensure that Afghan territory is not used for cross-border attacks. Kabul has denied these claims, saying that Afghan soil is not being used against any neighbouring country.Tensions between the two nations have grown following repeated attacks by the TTP, allegedly launched from Afghan soil. A recent attack in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Orakzai district killed 11 Pakistani soldiers, including a Lieutenant Colonel and a Major.","Khawaja Asif says Pakistan can no longer maintain its past relations with Afghanistan.

In the weeks leading up to the Pahalgam attack, Munir had stirred controversy by invoking the two-nation theory—the ideological foundation of Pakistan’s creation—urging citizens to inculcate in their children a sense of distinction from Hindus. He had further escalated tensions by describing Kashmir as Pakistan’s “jugular vein,” a phrase long associated with Islamabad’s territorial ambitions.Just days after the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, which claimed 26 lives, Munir reiterated his stance, declaring, ""The two-nation theory was based on the fundamental belief that Muslims and Hindus are two separate nations, not one.

Fierce Border Clash Between Pakistan, Afghanistan Intensifies With Tanks, Shelling, High Casualties





Pakistani PM Shehbaz Sharif said on Thursday that Islamabad was ready to hold talks with Afghanistan to resolve their conflict, as a temporary ceasefire that halted days of fierce fighting between the former allies largely held. The neighbouring nations engaged in ground fighting and Pakistan launched airstrikes across the contested frontier, killing dozens and wounding hundreds before agreeing to a 48-hour truce from 6.30pm on Wednesday.Sharif told his cabinet in Islamabad that Pakistan had “retaliated” as it ran out of patience with Afghanistan following a series of militant attacks. “If they want to talk on our valid conditions and want to resolve through dialogue we are ready for that,” Sharif said. “This message has been given to them yesterday. Now the ball is in their court. If this ceasefire is done just to buy time, we will not accept it.”There was no response to his remarks from Kabul.A statement from the Afghaninterior ministry said interior minister Khalifa Sirajuddin Haqqani met Iranian officials and told them that Afghanistan seeks good relations with all countries. “Just as we respect the sovereignty and dignity of others, we expect the same goodwill and respect toward us,” the statement quoted Haqqani as saying.At least 18 civilians were killed and more than 360 wounded in Afghanistan as a result of the fighting since Oct 10, the UN assistance mission in Afghanistan said.",Pakistani PM Shehbaz Sharif says Islamabad is ready to hold talks with Afghanistan to resolve their conflict.

A town united in grief

Hope that turned to heartbreak

Honour, heartbreak, and reflection

The meaning of his loss

A son remembered





The festive lights of Tihar, Nepal’s festival of joy and renewal, burned dim in Mahendranagar, a quiet town in the far-western plains of Nepal. The air that would normally echo with songs and laughter was heavy with grief. Hundreds gathered as the body of Bipin Joshi, a 23-year-old student who died in Hamas captivity, returned home after two years of uncertainty, heartbreak, and unanswered prayers.On Monday evening, his coffin, draped in Nepal’s crimson flag and garlands of marigolds, arrived from Kathmandu, where Prime Minister Sushila Karki had paid tribute earlier in the day. As the vehicle carrying his remains entered his hometown, residents lined the streets, lighting candles and bowing their heads. His mother wept quietly, surrounded by relatives, teachers, and classmates who once celebrated his dream of studying abroad.Mahendranagar, a small agricultural hub in Kanchanpur district, has never seen a loss like this. From dawn to dusk, residents poured into the Joshi family home, offering flowers, rice, and tears. The mood was sombre, the mourning collective. Neighbours spoke of Bipin not only as a promising student but as ""the pride of the town.""“Tihar is meant to be the festival of light, but for us, it will always remind us of darkness,” said Kishor Joshi, his cousin. “After two years of sleepless nights and hope for his return, all we have received is his body.”Many of those who came to pay respects recalled Bipin’s humility and his excitement before leaving Nepal in 2023. He had been selected to join an agricultural exchange programme in southern Israel, an opportunity he saw as a bridge to a better future for his family. Less than three weeks after arriving, Hamas militants stormed the kibbutz of Alumim, killing ten Nepali students and taking Bipin hostage.For two long years, the Joshi family fought tirelessly to keep his memory alive. They launched international appeals, travelled to Israel and the United States, and met diplomats and human rights groups in hopes of securing his release. His younger sister, Pushpa Joshi, just 18, told reporters earlier this month that she still believed she would “see her brother’s smiling face again.”That hope ended when Israeli officials confirmed that his body had been handed over by Hamas under the latest humanitarian truce. The Israeli Defence Forces said evidence suggested Bipin may have been killed early in captivity, though the timeline has not been verified independently.At home, the news spread through Mahendranagar like wildfire. Schools held moments of silence, shopkeepers shuttered their doors in mourning. “We never imagined our boy would be caught in someone else’s war,” said Ramesh Rawal, a local teacher who had mentored Bipin. “He went to learn, not to die.”Before his body was taken for cremation, local leaders and officials gathered to pay their respects. The coffin, carried through the town on a flower-decked truck, moved slowly as mourners followed behind chanting prayers.Prime Minister Sushila Karki, who called Bipin “a son of every Nepali mother,” said his courage and sacrifice would remain a national symbol. “He left to learn, to build, and to grow. Even in death, he unites us in compassion and sorrow,” she said.The final rites took place on the banks of the Mahakali River, where his family performed traditional rituals. As the pyre was lit, villagers sang folk hymns, a farewell to the boy they had watched grow up in their midst.Bipin’s death has struck a deep chord in Nepal, a country that sends thousands of workers and students abroad every year. His story reflects the precarious fate of many young Nepalis seeking opportunity overseas, often in volatile regions. The government has since vowed to review safety protocols for student exchange programmes and migrant workers.For the people of Mahendranagar, however, the policy debate feels distant. Their loss is immediate and personal. “Every flower in our garden will remind us of him,” read a family statement. “He was part of Nepal’s landscape, and now also part of Israel’s.”As night fell, the town remained lit with small oil lamps, each one flickering in his memory. Friends gathered quietly by his family’s home, sharing stories about his laughter, his love for music, and his dream to teach when he returned.In Mahendranagar, Bipin Joshi is no longer just a name in the news. He is remembered as a son of the soil, a young man whose pursuit of learning ended in a distant war, yet whose spirit brought an entire town together in grief and pride.And as the embers of his funeral fire faded into the river, one could sense that Mahendranagar would remember this Tihar not for its light, but for the boy who never made it home to see it again.","Bipin Joshi, a 23-year-old student who died in Hamas captivity, returned home after two years of uncertainty, heartbreak, and unanswered prayers.

PM Sushila Karki Vows Stability and Transparency While Briefing Diplomats on Nepal’s Polls





Nepal’s first woman prime minister, Sushila Karki , pledged on Wednesday that the March 5, 2026, general election would be conducted in a free, fair, and secure environment.Karki, 73, became Nepal’s first woman prime minister last month following the ouster of former PM K P Sharma Oli, after youth-led Gen Z protests over corruption and a social media ban.""We are responsible for addressing the legitimate voices of Gen Z in line with the Constitution. The government will create an environment where Nepalis can vote without fear, strengthening democracy, advancing prosperity, and safeguarding citizens’ rights,"" the interim PM said at an event in Madhyapur Thimi, Bhaktapur, as quoted by PTI.Her comments came a day after she met with representatives of major political parties for the first time since the caretaker government was formed last month, discussing preparations for the general elections and security issues. The meeting at the PM’s official residence in Baluwatar was attended by prominent leaders from several parties of the dissolved House of Representatives.Minister for communications and information technology Jagdish Kharel described the interaction as positive. ""All the representatives of political parties and cabinet members presented themselves with utmost responsibility to help in building an atmosphere for elections.It was a serious and thorough discussion for conducting elections, checking corruption, as well as ensuring security for the upcoming polls. The political parties were informed of the government's preparation for the election,” he said.The government also sought cooperation from all political parties in conducting free and fair elections. Nepal’s top electoral body has already announced March 5, 2026, as the date for the House of Representatives election.Those present from the government side included PM Karki, finance minister Rameshwor Khanal, energy minister Kulman Ghising, home minister Om Prakash Aryal, agriculture minister Madan Pariyar, and minister for communications & information technology Jagdish Kharel.Separately, representatives of those injured in the youth-led Gen Z movement last month met Karki and urged the government to take firm action against corrupt politicians. The 18-member delegation, led by Rupin Khadka, said, “Those we protested against are still free. What is stopping the government from arresting them? Is it the rules or the constitution?”PM Karki assured the delegation that the interim government is working within the law. “We will not go out of the spirit of the Gen Z movement. We will act through proper procedures and within the law. We are working according to the mandate given to us. Elections will be held, and investigations into corruption are progressing,” she said.","Nepal’s first woman prime minister, Sushila Karki, pledged on Wednesday that the March 5, 2026, general election would be conducted in a free, fair, and secure environment.
