The Washington Post has announced what it described as “significant restructuring,” at the organisation which includes shutting down its current Sports Desk and scaling back its international reportage footprint. According to Fox News, about a third of the organisation’s workforce has been affected, close to 300 people.Ishaan Tharoor, foreign affairs columnist at The Post and son of Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, is among journalists laid off as part of a major restructuring at the US newspaper that has sharply reduced its international coverage.Tharoor said he was “heartbroken” after being laid off, sharing the news in a post on X on Wednesday. “I have been laid off today from the Washington Post, along with most of the International staff and so many other wonderful colleagues,” he wrote.“I’m heartbroken for our newsroom and especially for the peerless journalists who served the Post internationally – editors and correspondents who have been my friends and collaborators for almost 12 years. It’s been an honour to work with them,” Tharoor added.In a separate post, Tharoor described it as “a bad day,” sharing a photograph of an empty newsroom.He also reflected on launching the WorldView column in 2017, saying it had been an honour to help readers make sense of global affairs and thanking the column’s roughly half a million subscribers.Several senior journalists and foreign correspondents confirmed their exits on social media.Will Hobson, an investigative reporter focused on sports, said on X: “Some personal news: I’m among today’s Washington Post layoffs. It was a dream 11-year run as an investigative reporter focused on sports.”Gerry Shih, the Post’s Jerusalem bureau chief, said he was laid off along with much of the Middle East team and international staff across regions. “I’m gone along with the rest of the ME team and the majority of teammates from Delhi to Beijing to Kyiv & Latam,” he wrote, calling it a “sad day.”Cairo bureau chief Claire Parker said the entire roster of Middle East correspondents and editors had been affected. “Hard to understand the logic. But I am grateful for my incredible colleagues,” she wrote.Other journalists impacted include Visual Forensics staffer Nilo Tabrizy, Ukraine correspondent Lizzie Johnson, and Berlin bureau chief Aaron Wiener, who said the Post had decided to eliminate its Berlin bureau. Johnson said she was “laid off by The Washington Post in the middle of a warzone.”National culture writer Jada Yuan and national politics reporter Brianna Tucker also spoke publicly about the layoffs, highlighting the personal and professional toll. “Thinking about my colleagues on the foreign desk living in war zones,” Yuan wrote.Former executive editor Marty Baron described the developments as among the most troubling in the newspaper’s history. “This ranks among the darkest days in the history of one of the world’s greatest news organisations,” Baron was quoted as saying by The Wrap.Reports have also said the cuts include the closure of the Books section, the cancellation of the Post Reports podcast, and further reductions in Metro and international coverage.The Washington Post is owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. The Washington Post Guild, which represents staff, issued a statement urging Bezos to continue investing in the paper’s journalistic mission. “Without the staff of The Washington Post, there is no Washington Post,” the union said.","The Washington Post has announced what it described as “significant restructuring,” at the organisation.

M R K Panneerselvam sparks row with ‘North Indians clean tables’ in Tamil Nadu remark; BJP hits back,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/panneerselvam-sparks-row-with-north-indians-clean-tables-in-tamil-nadu-remark-bjp-hits-back/articleshow/127922094.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party on Tuesday hit out at a Tamil Nadu minister over remarks about North Indian migrant workers, accusing the ruling DMK of repeatedly targeting migrants and fuelling social divisions in the state.The BJP was reacting to comments made by DMK agriculture minister M R K Panneer Selvam at a party event in Chengalpattu, where he referred to North Indians working in low-paying jobs.""People from the North are coming here to clean tables, engage in construction works, sell pani puri. Because he learnt only Hindi and had no job opportunity there, he has come here,"" the minister said.In a post on X, the BJP said the remarks were derogatory and reflected a broader pattern within the DMK.""At a party event in Chengalpattu, Tamil Nadu, DMK agriculture minister Shri MRK Panneer mocked North Indian migrants as “table cleaners and pani puri sellers.” In today’s India, people from every state work everywhere - North, South, and across the world. No job is small. No citizen is inferior,"" the party said.The BJP alleged that such comments were particularly dangerous at a time when incidents of violence against migrant workers were being reported in Tamil Nadu.""This isn’t an isolated slip; it’s a pattern. DMK leaders have repeatedly derided migrant workers, especially for being North Indian or for speaking Hindi. At a time when violence against innocent migrant workers in Tamil Nadu is rising, such statements are reckless and dangerous, branding an entire community as “low standard” and fuelling hate on the streets,"" the post said.The party also questioned the silence of leaders from the opposition INDI alliance over the controversy.""Now a direct question to the INDI alliance: if you claim to stand for unity, human dignity, and social justice, why this deafening silence? Is alliance compulsion more important than national unity? Do Shri RahulGandhi, Priyanka Gandhi , Akhilesh Yadav and Tejashwi Yadav endorse this hatred by staying quiet? Is this your idea of justice which is dividing Indians for votes? Complete shame!"" the BJP said.There was no immediate response from the DMK or the leaders named by the BJP on the issue.Meanwhile, Tamilnadu BJP president in a post on X said, ""Leaders of Arivalayam who incite hatred against North Indians!Even as attacks on North Indians are already rampant under the DMK regime, I strongly condemn the Minister of DMK, Mr. MRK Panneer,for mocking them at a meeting held in Maduranthakam in Chengalpattu district by saying, “North Indians come to Tamil Nadu only to sell pani puri, work in construction, or wipe tables.” The DMK Minister must immediately seek a public apology from the people for his arrogant speech.In our Tamil land, which has upheld equality and brotherhood through the life philosophy of “Yadhum Oore, Yaavarum Keleer,” it is not only deplorable but also dangerous that DMK leaders continue to sow seeds of hatred against North Indians. Do the Congress and Communist parties, as alliance partners of DMK, endorse this divisive politics of the DMK, which strives to divide people ethnically into North and South?In our Bharat, which shares a unified cultural heritage “from the Himalayas to Kanyakumari,” the people will uproot and cast away this venomous creeper called DMK—which toils to seize power and authority by using North Indian people as scapegoats—in the upcoming Assembly elections!""",The BJP was reacting to comments made by DMK agriculture minister M R K Panneer Selvam at a party event in Chengalpattu.

NEW DELHI: In a suspected case of road rage, a 36-year-old businessman has died after allegedly being beaten with a helmet by two food-delivery riders during a brawl in Connaught Place last month. Police have arrested the two men.The deceased, Shivam Gupta, lived with his parents in Laxmi Nagar and ran a construction business with his brother-in-law. The incident occurred in the early hours of Jan 3 when Gupta, returning from a party with a friend, was walking near the Rajiv Chowk metro station in the E-block parking area.Police said he brushed against the handle of an approaching bike, leading to an argument, after which the accused allegedly assaulted him with their helmets and fled, leaving him bleeding on the pavement.Gupta, critically injured, underwent multiple medical procedures across hospitals and briefly showed signs of recovery before he died on Jan 19.His father, Anil Kant Gupta, who runs garment shops, said CCTV footage shown to him by police featured three men — a detail also recorded in the FIR. However, officers told him only two men were directly involved in the assault and have been arrested, while the third allegedly handed over the helmet used in the attack.Distraught, the father said, ""All I want is that no innocent man is punished and no guilty man walks free."" Fighting back tears, he added, ""My son was known to make peace between people. He never instigated anyone. He was on a call and simply tried to block a bike coming towards him… and they attacked him.""He added that his daughter had moved out after her marriage, and Shivam's death has now left the elderly couple alone with no one to look after them.","Shivam Gupta, 36, died after allegedly being beaten with a helmet by two food- delivery riders.

PRAYAGRAJ: After decades of waiting, Dhani Ram finally won his freedom in his 100th year. Allahabad high court last month acquitted the Hamirpur native, convicted in 1984 for a 1982 murder tied to a property feud.Though sentenced to life, he was released on bail that same year, spending 42 years waiting for finality while his appeal crawled through the docket.A division bench of Justices Chandra Dhari Singh and Sanjiv Kumar, in a 23-page ruling dated Jan 21, tore into contradictions they found in the prosecution’s case — from unreliable testimony of two eyewitnesses to omissions in FIR and what the court called “inherent improbabilities.”With main accused Maiku absconding since 1982 and allegedly the one who fired the fatal shot, the judges said the prosecution had failed to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt.When a person stands before the court at the twilight of existence, the insistence on penal consequences, after decades of procedural delay, risks transforming justice into a ritual divorced from the purpose it intends,” the bench wrote, adding that prolonged anxiety, uncertainty and social fallout “cannot be ignored” when deciding what justice now requires.Dhani Ram and co-accused Satti Din had been convicted under IPC sections 302 read with 34 for accompanying Maiku during the killing.Satti Din died during his own pending appeal, leaving Dhani Ram the lone surviving appellant.His counsel said he was only accused of exhortation, not firing any shot. State counsel opposed the acquittal.The Allahabad high court ruled that the benefit of doubt must go to the centenarian. With acquittal granted, his bail bond stands discharged.","Allahabad high court last month acquitted the Hamirpur native, convicted in 1984 for a 1982 murder tied to a property feud.

Sonam Wangchuk's Wife Blasts Modi Govt & CRPF Over 6Th Schedule, Dismisses FCRA, Pak Link Charges

SC asks govt to produce original files on Wangchuk’s detention

NEW DELHI: Observing that the medical condition of climate activist Sonam Wangchuk , who has been in detention for more than four months, is not very good, Supreme Court asked the Centre Wednesday to rethink/relook its decision to continue to keep him in custody, reports Amit Anand Choudhary.SC had earlier directed authorities to conduct Wangchuk’s medical examination by a specialised doctor and file a report before it. The activist is currently lodged in Jodhpur jail. The medical report was placed before the apex court during the last hearing.Wangchuk was detained on Sept 26 last year under the National Security Act following protests in Leh over demands of statehood and Sixth Schedule status for Ladakh. SC is hearing the plea moved by Wangchuk’s wife Gitanjali Angmo against his preventive detention.Apart from submissions, counter submissions and law points, just give a thought to it, as an officer of the court. The detention order was passed on Sept 26, 2025, nearly five months have passed. Considering the health condition of the detainee… which is certainly not very good.There are certain age-related, may be otherwise. Is there a possibility for the govt to rethink, have a relook?” the bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and P B Varale asked.Additional solicitor general K M Natraj told the bench he will take instruction and will brief the court on the next date of hearing.The bench also directed the govt to place before it original files related to Wangchuk’s detention and the process adopted by the govt. Nataraj submitted that the govt had nothing to hide, and will place the documents.The additional solicitor general submitted that the speech given by Sonam Wangchuk on Sept 24 last year was so provocative that it eventually led to the violent protest, which claimed the lives of four people.“Four people died in the incident, and 161 were injured. I will place the materials. Ultimately, it was his provocative speech, his instigation, which led to violence. The person needs not to be actively participating in it. It is the propensity of the person to influence the group of people or to commit somebody else to do a violent act which is relevant. That is more than sufficient for prevention detention,” he submitted.“It (NSA) is only a preventive law. It is only to prevent somebody from acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order or security of the state. Preventive detention is not punitive detention. It has to be necessarily left to the discretion of the executing authority. It is purely discretionary,” he said.Earlier, the govt had told the court that the activist was trying to create political and social turmoil and unrest in Ladakh, and was making an attempt to emulate what happened in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal.",SC had earlier directed authorities to conduct Wangchuk’s medical examination by a specialised doctor and file a report before it.

JAMMU: A Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) commander was among three terrorists killed in separate gunfights with security forces in snow-covered forests of Udhampur and Kishtwar districts in J&K’s Jammu division Wednesday, officials said.Sources identified the slain JeM man as Rubani, alias Abu Mavia, though there was no official confirmation of his identity by authorities. Security forces launched a seek-and-shoot operation Tuesday in Jopher forest near Basantgarh — a mountainous area of Udhampur district about 65km northeast of Jammu city — acting on specific intelligence inputs.“Heavy exchange of fire rocked the forest around 4pm Tuesday when the terrorists attempted to break out of the cordon,” an official said. Reinforcements, including paratroopers and dog squads, were rushed in to seal escape routes across the rugged terrain.For several hours overnight, troops maintained a tight vigil using drones and ground surveillance before launching a final assault at daybreak. Both terrorists were killed in the morning operation, officials said.In Dichhar area of Kishtwar district, a suspected Pakistani terrorist was killed Wednesday evening in a running hunt across snowbound mountains.The Army’s White Knight Corps said on X the action followed renewed contact with terrorists on the run. Forces have pursued the group since Jan 18, when a clash broke out at Sonnar village near Mandral–Singhpora — hill hamlets south of Kishtwar town — killing a paratrooper and wounding seven soldiers. Terrorists slipped away through dense vegetation and broken ridgelines.Search teams had been combing Sanjinala–Dichhar axis inside Chingam forest, part of the Chatroo belt — a rugged stretch of terrain roughly 190km northeast of Jammu. The area has remained under deep snow for weeks.They were intercepted again several km away on Jan 22. Contact broke.

JAMMU: The crucial talks between the Ladakh leadership and the high-powered home ministry committee ended without any conclusion in New Delhi on Wednesday, with the Ladakhi representatives hoping for another meeting soon.“The Apex Body Leh and the Kargil Democratic Alliance today held a meeting with the committee headed by MoS Home Nityanand Rai. Home secretary was also present. We had submitted a draft proposal and discussions were held only on the issues of statehood and the sixth schedule. Talks continued for a long time, but they did not reach any conclusion,” Chering Dorjay Lakrook, co-chairman of the Leh Apex Body (LAB), said after the talks.Sixth schedule of the Indian Constitution provides for the administration of tribal areas in certain states to protect tribal autonomy, culture, and land.“We cannot say whether talks were successful or a failure. There was no conclusion. We hope the home ministry will soon call another meeting and discuss the same issues,” he said. “We will not take today's talks as negative or positive. Since the talks are continuing, we do not want to delve into it further,” he said.Asgar Ali Karbali, co-chairman of the Kargil Democratic Alliance, said detailed deliberations were held on statehood and the sixth schedule. “Before holding talks on these issues, we raised the issue of four youths who were ‘martyred’ in September last year and those who have been detained,"" he said.“We sought the release of Sonam Wangchuk and others and said allegations against them are baseless. We also sought dignified compensation for the families of those killed in the violence,” he said, adding that the discussions continued for about two-and-a-half hours. “We hope the next meeting will be held in 15 days. We are neither satisfied nor hopeless.”The first round of talks between the committee and Ladakhi representatives was held on Oct 22, 2025, in New Delhi. Ladakh was represented by the LAB and the KDA, which are amalgam of political and religious groups from the Leh and Kargil regions, respectively.The first round of the talks took place after the Centre ordered an inquiry into the Sept 24 police firing on protesters in Leh who were demanding statehood and sixth schedule status for the union territory. Four protesters were killed in the firing. After the commission was set up, the LAB and the KDA agreed to begin talks with the Centre, leading to the Oct 22 meeting.Later, on Nov 14, the LAB and the KDA submitted a 29-page joint draft proposal to the home ministry seeking statehood and sixth schedule. The proposal also sought a general amnesty for LAB member and climate activist Sonam Wangchuk and others detained after the Sept 24 protests.","Talks between the Ladakh leadership and the high-powered home ministry committee ended without any conclusion in New Delhi on Wednesday. “We cannot say whether talks were successful or a failure.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday agreed to examine a public interest litigation challenging the decision of National Board of Examinations in Medical Sciences to reduce the qualifying cut-off percentiles for NEET-PG 202526, which would allow even candidates with zero or negative scores to qualify.A bench of Justices P S Narasimha and Alok Aradhe issued a notice on the PIL and posted the case for Feb 6.The petitioners alleged that reducing the cut-off would affect patient safety, public health and the medical profession. They raised the point that the move, undertaken primarily to fill vacant seats, abolished merit as a criterion and converted a competitive examination into an administrative formality. They said medicine directly impacted human life, bodily integrity and dignity, and dilution of professional standards in the field was impermissible.Over 18,000 postgraduate medical seats across the country remain vacant.","Justices P S Narasimha and Alok Aradhe issued a notice on the PIL and posted the case for Feb 6.

Nishikant takes a page out of Rahul’s book to attack Congress,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nishikant-takes-a-page-out-of-rahuls-book-to-attack-congress/articleshow/127921067.cms,"Nishikant Dubey

NEW DELHI: Lok Sabha, already deadlocked over Rahul Gandhi’s insistence on referring to an unpublished book, was plunged into deeper impasse on Wednesday as BJP MP Nishikant Dubey turned to a pile of books with uncharitable references to members of the Nehru-Gandhi family to “expose” Congress.PM Modi’s reply to the motion of thanks on the President’s address had to be called off due to the stepped-up protest from the opposition.Dubey’s move was seen as BJP’s bid to turn the heat on Congress, which has been attacking Modi over bits of the unpublished book authored by ex-Army chief Gen M M Naravane (retd), and it further riled up the protesting opposition MPs in LS, who turned up the noise and tore papers, but not before the fourth-term member had his say for over a couple of minutes.TDP MP Krishna Tenneti, who was in the Chair, kept asking Dubey not to carry on and that his speech was against Speaker Om Birla’s ruling. “You listen to me. You cannot do this,” Tenneti said even as the BJP MP continued.The Chair later adjourned the House, but several opposition MPs questioned why Dubey was allowed to go on. Congress members later met LS Speaker Birla and demanded his suspension.The books Dubey mentioned included ‘Reminiscences of the Nehru Age’ by former private secretary to India’s first PM, M O Mathai; ‘Edwina and Nehru’, ‘Ceasefires’ and ‘The Red Sari’, and then touched on their content, including some controversial references to private lives besides allegations of corruption, amid furious protests.These books were either banned when Congress was in office or restricted to the extent that they were not available. “Since a book which is not published is being discussed, I want to speak about books which are full of stories of the corruption, deviousness, wanton indulgences and corruption of the Nehru family,” Dubey alleged, a charge he elaborated during a press conference later.Congress MPs, including Priyanka Gandhi, K C Venugopal and Deepender Hooda, urged Birla to suspend Dubey, and demanded that Rahul be allowed to speak before Modi’s reply on motion of thanks on the President’s address.Unrelenting protest from opposition members meant that Modi’s address scheduled for 5 pm was called off.In his comments to the media later, Dubey referred to more books, many of them he said were banned, to target Congress’s leading family over a host of allegations, including personal indulgences. This included ‘Himalayan Blunder’, a damning account of Indian leadership during the 1962 war with China which was banned, but became available later.","BJP MP Nishikant Dubey turned to a pile of books with uncharitable references to members of the Nehru-Gandhi family to “expose” Congress.

Banking on all 36 communities to restore peace: Manipur CM

GUWAHATI/IMPHAL: Yumnam Khemchand Singh of BJP was sworn in Wednesday as the CM of Manipur's reinstated NDA govt along with Kuki legislator Nemcha Kipgen and Naga MLA Losii Dikho as his deputies, marking a fresh spin on shared governance in a multi-ethnic state riven by the Meitei-Kuki conflict.Governor AK Bhalla also administered the oath of office to BJP's Konthoujam Govindas and Khuraijam Loken Singh of NPP as cabinet ministers at the Lok Bhavan ceremony, which ended almost a year of President’s rule since N Biren Singh resigned over criticism of the previous govt's handling of the violence that erupted in May 2023.Khemchand Singh, a former assembly speaker from the state’s majority Meitei community, said there was nothing he wanted more than to fulfil the faith reposed in him by PM Modi and home minister Amit Shah.Manipur has 36 communities. Our hope rests on all of them to help establish a peaceful atmosphere,” CM Khemchand Singh told reporters.Khemchand, elected leader of the BJP legislature party on Tuesday, had called on the governor along with central observer Tarun Chugh, BJP's northeast coordinator Sambit Patra and ex-CM Biren Singh, among others, to stake claim to form the govt.PM Modi, who visited the state last Sept for the first time since the conflict, congratulated the new CM and his newly-inducted colleagues in a post on X. “I am confident they will work diligently towards furthering development and prosperity for my sisters and brothers of Manipur,” he wrote.Deputy CM Dikho, who is from BJP ally Naga People’s Front, reinforced the sentiment of reconciliation. “We hope to fulfil the people’s aspirations. Our first task is to reach out to them. Inclusiveness is the mantra of this govt,” he said. On whether action would be taken against armed groups that had threatened Kuki legislators participating in govt formation, Dikho replied, “Why not?”Kipgen, whose appointment as deputy CM has invited criticism from Kuki-Zo organisations pressing for the creation of a Union territory for the community, took oath through videoconferencing from Delhi’s Manipur Bhawan. The Kuki-Zo Council said any of the 10 MLAs from the party joining the govt would do so “at their own risk”.Two Kuki-Zo MLAs, LM Khaute and Ngursanglur Sanate, attended the swearing-in, marking the first time in more than two years that any of the community’s elected representatives had set foot in Meitei-majority Imphal.Four parties – Meghalaya CM Conrad Sangma's NPP with six MLAs, NPF with five MLAs, JD(U) with one legislator and two independents – extended unconditional support to BJP. NPP had briefly withdrawn support to NDA in Manipur in Nov 2024, citing the then CM Biren Singh's failure to resolve the ethnic crisis. Khemchand chaired a cabinet meeting at his new official bungalow in the evening. “The meeting marked the beginning of collective decision-making and governance for the newly constituted state cabinet,” his office said in an official statement.Sources said the assembly was likely to be in session from Friday. The House has been under suspended animation since Feb 2025.",Yumnam Khemchand Singh of BJP was sworn in Wednesday as the CM of Manipur's reinstated NDA govt along with Kuki legislator Nemcha Kipgen and Naga MLA Losii Dikho as his deputies.

Kashmir BEd colleges face large-scale de-affiliation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kashmir-bed-colleges-face-large-scale-de-affiliation/articleshow/127916579.cms,"Representative image

JAMMU: University of Kashmir (UoK)’s latest BEd Admission notification, which limits applications to only two private colleges, has led to large-scale de-affiliation of nearly 55 colleges, with far-reaching consequences for employment, private higher education and Kashmir’s ability to attract students from outside Jammu and Kashmir.According to the notification issued by UoK for the 2025-2027 session, only two colleges are recognised by National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) and have invited applications from eligible candidates for admission to two-year BEd programmes.Professor C L Vishen, president of Kashmir Private BEd Colleges’ Association, said about 75 BEd colleges were operating in the Valley before 2019. After the nullification of Article 370 in 2019, NCTE norms became applicable to J&K, and the number of colleges shrank, primarily because most institutions did not meet the requirement of transferring land to the college trust.Prof Vishen, however, said that the provision in the 2014 NCTE Amendment Act regarding land transfer did not have a retrospective effect in J&K and should not apply to most colleges in Kashmir, as they had been established before 2014. “We repeatedly pointed this out to NCTE but received no response. Even the CM has recommended our case to Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan, but there has been no outcome so far,” Vishen said.Syed Masroor Andrabi, chairperson of Chinab Valley College of Education, said BEd colleges in Kashmir stood at the verge of closure. “It is not merely an academic concern but a serious employment and social crisis. These institutions sustain thousands of students, teachers, and non-teaching staff, and serve as a crucial pipeline for trained educators in our schools,” Andrabi said.A senior UoK official said after the nullification of Article 370, NCTE had granted repeated relaxations to colleges, asking them to complete documentation, including transfer of land to the college trust, for several years, but the colleges didn’t fulfil the requirements, forcing NCTE to act this year.University officials said once land is transferred, the process becomes irrevocable, which has caused hesitation among some institutions. “Admissions for this year are already over. If colleges fulfil the requirements by next June, they will be allowed to admit students again,” said an official.",University of Kashmir (UoK)’s latest BEd Admission notification has led to large-scale de-affiliation of nearly 55 colleges.

GUWAHATI/IMPHAL: Yumnam Khemchand Singh was sworn in as Manipur’s new chief minister on Wednesday, marking the restoration of the NDA govt in the state as the Centre revoked the nearly year-long President’s Rule imposed in the wake of the Meitei-Kuki ethnic conflict.BJP’s Kuki legislator Nemcha Kipgen and Naga MLA Losii Dikho of ally Naga People’s Front were inducted as deputy chief ministers. Senior BJP legislator Konthoujam Govindas and Khuraijam Loken Singh of NPP were sworn in as cabinet ministers at Lok Bhavan in Imphal.Governor AK Bhalla administered the oath of office and secrecy to all four leaders, with Kipgen taking her oath virtually from Manipur Bhawan in New Delhi.The event marked the fragile state’s return to representative governance with a new power equation — a deliberate attempt to give representation to Manipur’s three major communities, Meitei, Kuki and Naga, in a balancing act aimed at rebuilding the fractured ethnic landscape.It comes after two years of ethnic violence between Meiteis and Kukis that claimed over 260 lives and displaced thousands, leaving the Assembly under suspended animation since February 2025.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while congratulating the new CM and other newly inducted ministers, wrote on X: “I’m confident they will work diligently towards furthering development and prosperity for my sisters and brothers of Manipur.”In his first reaction after being sworn in, Khemchand said he wanted to fulfil the faith reposed in him by Prime Minister Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah. Speaking to the media outside Lok Bhavan soon after taking oath, Singh underlined the diversity of the state.“Manipur comprises 36 communities and the state was taken care of for long by these communities. Our hope now is for all to help in bringing a peaceful atmosphere,” he said. “Modi and Shah have placed great faith in me and I want to take that faith forward,” he added.Deputy CM Dikho echoed the sentiment of reconciliation. “We hope to fulfill the aspirations of the people of the state. Our first task is to reach out to them. Inclusiveness is the new mantra of the govt,” he said.Asked whether action would be taken against armed groups that have issued threats to Kuki legislators participating in govt formation, Dikho replied, “Why not.”Khemchand was felicitated at the party office Thambal Sanglen in Imphal. Speaking on the occasion, Khemchand said he and his cabinet will prioritise activities to ensure the return of peace and normalcy in the state.Appealing for peace and harmony, he said 36 communities are living together in Manipur and we should not forget that these 36 communities have been guarding the state together for many years.But Kuki civil society, led by the Kuki-Zo Council (KZC), has taken a hard line against its 10 MLAs joining any new govt, warning that if they defy the collective decision, they would be doing so “at their own risk.”Khemchand was elected leader of the BJP legislature party on Tuesday after the party’s central leaders held a meeting in Delhi with NDA MLAs from Manipur.Notably, among other MLAs, including those of the opposition Congress, two Kuki-Zo MLAs LM Khaute and Ngursanglur Sanate attended the swearing-in ceremony. This was the first time in more than two years that Kuki-Zo MLAs set foot in Imphal after clashes erupted between the Meitei and Kuki communities in May 2023.Four political parties — the NPP with six MLAs, NPF with five MLAs, JD(U) with one MLA and two independents — have extended unconditional support to BJP, a Lok Bhavan statement said.Earlier in the afternoon, Khemchand, accompanied by party leaders including central observer Tarun Chugh, BJP state unit president A. Sharda Devi, BJP northeast coordinator Sambit Patra, former CM N. Biren Singh, and five other MLAs from alliance partners, called on overnor Bhalla and staked claim to form the government.Just after the swearing-in ceremony, Khemchand chaired a cabinet meeting at the CM’s bunglow in the evening. An ofgficial statement said, ""The meeting marked the beginning of collective decision-making and governance for the newly constituted state cabinet.”Sources said the assembly session is expected to be held from Friday.",BJP’s Kuki legislator Nemcha Kipgen and Naga Losii Dikho were inducted as chief ministers.

Movement towards Mumbai completely stopped: How thousands of motorists endured 32-hour traffic nightmare on expressway,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/movement-towards-mumbai-completely-stopped-how-thousands-of-motorists-endured-32-hour-traffic-nightmare-on-expressway/articleshow/127922787.cms,"The accident occurred about 50m ahead of the tunnel in the Borghat stretch, which falls in the Khandala ghat section of Raigad district. Soon, gas began leaking from the damaged tanker.





Strong safety concerns prompted the halting of vehicular traffic towards Mumbai and partially towards Pune, leading to a logjam spanning several kilometres and leaving commuters stranded overnight and through most of Wednesday. It was only around 10.30 pm that gas was transferred from the damaged tanker to a new one. The Mumbai-bound carriageway reopened after 1 am on Thursday following removal of the tanker with a crane.





Stranded commuters: Among those trapped were children, senior citizens, and patients. Sunita Patil (57) was stuck in traffic for over seven hours. Her son Aadesh told TOI, “My brother, Sandesh, rode a two-wheeler — despite twowheelers being barred on the expressway — from Kharghar in Navi Mumbai to the accident site around 1 am on Wednesday to extricate her.”

We could not reach the hospital because of the road closure.”





Wider disruption: While a 15-km stretch was log-jammed, sources said traffic disruption extended to around 50 km over 30 hours. Wasim Joad, a resident of Vimannagar, managed to reach Mumbai via Tamhini Ghat after returning to Pune, saying, “Though the journey was longer, I reached the destination as it was important.”

Wasim Joad, a resident of Vimannagar, managed to reach Mumbai via Tamhini Ghat after returning to Pune, saying, “Though the journey was longer, I reached the destination as it was important.” Cause of accident: Police said the tanker overturned as the driver could not control speed on the slope near the tunnel. It was damaged at three spots on the valve, leading to leakage. Rescue teams — including NDRF, BPCL, disaster management officials, and fire brigade — rushed to the spot, but leakage could not be stopped, requiring chemical experts to be called in.

Authorities’ response: Highway police superintendent Tanaji Chikhale said, “One of the three lanes from the Pune carriageway side was opened for vehicles moving towards Mumbai on Wednesday. We urged people planning to travel to Mumbai to take alternate routes via Tamhini Ghat, Malshej Ghat or Bhimashankar.” Light vehicles were diverted via Khopoli from the Magic Point, and entry was stopped near Kiwale in Pimpri Chinchwad.

BPCL statement: BPCL officials said the recovery van could not be sent immediately as it was stationed at the Kochi refinery. “The expert team failed to arrest minor leakages in the tanker. Therefore, it was decided to de-contain the gas into other tankers to prevent escalation of risk. The tanker underwent mandatory checks before induction and was suitable for carrying the gas. The leakage occurred due to the accident, not any apparent design flaw. Nevertheless, this will be examined in the investigation,” a senior BPCL official told TOI.

However, none of the purported victims has lodged a formal complaint.Police, probing the incident of firing at filmmaker Rohit Shetty's bungalow early Sunday, said information gathered by them indicates that some celebrities were not keen on approaching police. With no reason emerging on why Shetty was specifically targeted, investigators believe the incident may have been intended to instil fear in the film industry.Police sources say gangster Shubham Lonkar has made extortion calls to at least five Bollywood celebrities, though none of them is keen on filing a complaint. ""What baffles us is that despite intelligence inputs suggesting multiple threat calls, no one has come forward to record a statement or file a complaint,"" said a senior police officer on condition of anonymity. ""If people expect police to act suo motu (on its own) while withholding facts, it becomes extremely difficult.Police officials said filmmaker Rohit Shetty himself has denied receiving threat calls. This appears to belie the social media post attributed to Lawrence Bishnoi associate Lonkar, in which he claimed responsibility for the firing and alleged that Shetty had been warned repeatedly.Lonkar's post, written in Hindi and English, said: ""Ram Ram, Jai Bajrang Bali, to all brothers. We, Shubham Lonkar, Aarzoo Bhishnoi, Hari Boxer, and Harman Shandu, take responsibility for the firing that took place today at film director Rohit Shetty's house (Shetty Tower) in Mumbai.""It said: ""We messaged him many times telling him not to interfere in our work, but he didn't understand. We've given him this small trailer. If he doesn't understand our message and doesn't listen to us, then the next bullet won't be fired outside his house, but inside his bedroom, right in his chest. And this is a warning to the entire Bollywood industry: mend your ways while you still have time, otherwise, your situation will be very bad. ""Multiple police teams have now been sent to several parts of the country to trace the shooter involved in the firing. Investigators believe the arrest of the gunman could help establish who ordered the attack and whether it was indeed linked to an extortion bid.""At this stage, extortion appears to be the only plausible motive,"" a police officer said, while adding that other angles have not been ruled out. In the firing outside actor Salman Khan's house, the gang claimed it was seeking revenge for the killing of a blackbuck, considered sacred by the Bishnoi community.On the other hand, standup comedian Munawar Faruqui was targeted because he allegedly hurt the community's sentiments during one of his shows.After Baba Siddiqui's murder, the gang had alleged that he was close to Salman Khan and also had links to Dawood Ibrahim. They also claimed vengeance for the death of their associate Anuj Thapan in police custody. Thapan had been arrested for the firing on Salman Khan's house.",Police sources say gangster Shubham Lonkar has made extortion calls to at least five Bollywood celebrities.

Felix “xQc” Lengyel explains why he rejected Plaqueboymax’s comments about Aspen Kartier





Felix “xQc” Lengyel reacted sharply this week after fellow streamer Plaqueboymax spoke in support of Aspen Kartier during an ongoing animal abuse case. The situation became public after Aspen Kartier was accused of harming her three-month-old Maltipoo puppy during a Twitch livestream. The alleged act happened off camera, but viewers said they heard the incident, which quickly spread across social media. Aspen Kartier was taken into custody by Brookhaven Police in Georgia on January 30, 2026, one day after the incident on January 29, 2026. As the case gained attention, several streamers shared their opinions. Plaqueboymax said he hoped Kartier could change and move forward. That response did not sit well with xQc.On February 2, 2026, a clip from xQc's Twitch stream was shared on X by user @yeet. The video showed xQc who expressed his complete disagreement with any form of sympathy shown towards cases that involve harm to animals. His reaction quickly sparked debate across the streaming community.During his stream, Felix “xQc” Lengyel said he draws a clear line when it comes to animal abuse. He explained that while conflicts between adults can be handled in many ways, hurting an animal is not something he can accept.“I don’t want to hear anything positive about this,” Lengyel said during the broadcast. “I can understand people arguing or fighting, but when it comes to hurting an animal, that is where I stop listening. I will not be open to excuses, now or later.”Plaqueboymax had earlier shared his thoughts during a Grammys-night Twitch stream. In a clip posted on February 1, 2026, by X user @clippedszn, he said he still believed Aspen Kartier was a good person despite the situation.“I know something bad happened,” Plaqueboymax said. “It’s wrong, and I don’t support that. But I hope she can fix things and learn from it.”That comment led to pushback from viewers and fellow creators. Many felt the focus should remain on accountability rather than forgiveness. xQc echoed that view and said animal safety should never be treated lightly.The case remains under public attention as fans wait for official updates. No further legal details have been released by Brookhaven Police as of now.In related news, Felix “xQc” Lengyel was also recently involved in a public disagreement with Imane “Pokimane” Anys after she shared her thoughts on changes in the streaming industry on X, showing how active discussions remain within the creator space.",Felix “xQc” Lengyel said he draws a clear line when it comes to animal abuse.

"'Indians came to America, and then they became...': Burt Thakur speaks on 'Indian takeover' at Frisco council meeting",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/indians-came-to-america-and-then-they-became-burt-thakur-speaks-on-indian-takeover-at-frisco-council-meeting/articleshow/127914664.cms,"



As the issue of 'Indian takeover' of Frisco rocked the council meeting Tuesday, pushed by influencers on social media, Frisco council's first Indian-origin member Burt Thakur spoke about the issue and said Indians who came to America upheld American Dream because American Dream needs participation.“Somewhere along the way Indians came to America, and then they became Americans, and then they helped to reinforce the American Dream because the American Dream requires participation,” Thakur said. “People are upset. And I suppose what I’m trying to say to you is this. Look to the left of you and look to the right of you. This is Frisco. … Together we can do amazing things,"" Thakur said as he spoke about the first Indians who came to the US, the Punjabis who settled in California, and Indians who served the US.Dallas Observer reported that a dozen speakers flaunting America First hats spoke at the city council chamber and raged against the alleged H-1B visa and the 'Indian takeover'. But a majority of those who spoke against the apparent 'Indian takeover' were not from Frisco.Amit Radjadhyaksha, a Frisco resident, spoke about the assimilation of Indians and said he's a proud Indian, American and a citizen of Frisco. “I would welcome anyone who has divergent views to come sit down over a beer or a coffee and have a conversation about what we can do to help each other out in these times,” Radjadhyaksha said.“I’m Indian, I’m American. I’m a proud citizen of Frisco, and I’m not going anywhere.""Burt Thakur spoke about H-1B earlier too and said he had no authority over federal immigration policy or visa enforcement and rejected the suggestion that local officials were orchestrating demographic change. “I really would have no problem with any federal agency coming in and doing an audit,” Thakur said earlier. “And if things are found that are illegal … I’ll be the first supporter and the biggest supporter of those agencies coming in and being able to do their job. ”“If people have done stuff legally … it’s something that is their right to do,” he said, adding that he takes offense at suggestions that the presence of Indian residents itself is problematic. “Please, feel free to tell me what percentage of the population is allowed to be Indian,” Thakur said.Facing questions over Indian donors, Thakur said he is an American citizen who served during 9/11 and is now focused on local governance in his capacity as a councilman.",Frisco council's first Indian-origin member Burt Thakur spoke about the issue and said Indians who came to America upheld American Dream because American Dream needs participation.

On Cam: Philippine Ferry Sinks With Over 300 Onboard; Dozens Feared Dead In Big Tragedy





A catastrophic fire destroyed more than a 1000 homes in the coastal city of Bongao in southern Philippines. The fire, which started on Tuesday night, destroyed much of the residential area, leaving thousands homeless.The blaze spread quickly, fuelled by strong winds and the highly flammable materials used in many houses, according to Ecuador Comunicacion. Around 5,000 residents live in the affected area. The Municipal Risk Management Office said the fire broke out at about 10 pm and was brought under control by 2 am on Wednesday.Families fled in panic, evacuating by land and sea while trying to save whatever belongings they could. Visuals shared on social media showed the scale of the devastation, with collapsed roofs, charred walls and entire sections of the neighbourhood reduced to ashes.Rescue teams shifted displaced residents to temporary shelters. Bangsamoro chief minister Abdulraof Macacua ordered the immediate dispatch of relief supplies, including food, drinking water, tents, medical equipment and security personnel.Authorities are still investigating the cause of the fire, though initial reports suggest it may have started inside a house.Property damage is estimated at 17.5 million Philippine pesos.The tragedy adds to a series of recent fires in the region, where unsafe construction practices and harsh weather conditions have made coastal communities particularly vulnerable. Officials say determining the cause of the blaze will be key to preventing similar disasters in the future.","Fire destroyed more than a 1000 homes in the coastal city of Bongao in southern Philippines.

Indian-origin restaurant owner Vikas Nath caught spiking woman’s drink at UK club; staff swap glass before calling police,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/indian-origin-restaurant-owner-vikas-nath-caught-spiking-womans-drink-at-uk-club-staff-swap-glass-before-calling-police/articleshow/127897598.cms,"



A Knightsbridge restaurant owner of Indian origin is on trial after being caught attempting to spike a woman’s drink with a date-rape drug (Any drug that incapacitates a person and renders them vulnerable to sexual assault).63-year-old Vikas Nath used a straw to put gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) into the woman’s spicy margarita while sitting with her on the rooftop garden bar at the exclusive Mayfair private members’ club Annabel’s.Vikas owns a string of high-end restaurants in the UK and Spain, including two with Michelin stars, reports The London Standard.Staff at Annabel’s noticed Nath dipping the straw into a small bottle of vanilla extract he had retrieved from his pocket, sucking up liquid, and putting it into the cocktail. The staff replaced the drink before the woman could drink it, and Nath threw the bottle into the toilet when police were called. Managers checked the CCTV and warned the woman that her drink might have been spiked.Prosecuting the case, Tim Clark KC told jurors: ""This case is unusual because there's no dispute Mr Nath spiked her drink. His acceptance is not surprising, he had little choice because the spiking was captured on CCTV at Annabel's.Due to the actions of quick-thinking staff, the spiked drink was retrieved, and she was warned. Staff replaced it with a fresh one, and police were called to the club.""Nath admits spiking the drink but claims it was to ""relax"" the woman.One message read: ""I'm at Annabel's. This is probably the last evening with (her). She ain't biting.""His friend replied: ""Action time I hope.""Traces of the sleep-inducing drug were later found, and police discovered two more bottles under his sink at home. Nath claimed in police interviews that he obtained GBL as a cleaning fluid for a high-performance car and was told it could be drunk as a ""relaxant."" He said he disposed of the bottle because he believed the club would not approve.","63-year-old Vikas Nath used a straw to put gamma-butyrolactone into the woman’s spicy margarita.
