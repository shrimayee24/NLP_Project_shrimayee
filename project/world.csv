Wangchuk drew comparisons with Chinese, Pakistani provinces: Govt

NEW DELHI: As the Centre justified on Wednesday the detention of climate activist Sonam Wangchuk by pointing out his alleged inflammatory speeches and the use of Gandhian principles as a facade, Supreme Court said that it was reading too much into his statements.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta told the court that the govt won’t review Wangchuk’s detention order on medical grounds as he is “hale and hearty”. Mehta said that the activist was being taken care of in jail and had a minor infection. SC had last week asked the Centre to rethink his continued detention.Referring to one of the speeches, a bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and P B Varale said that the activist was himself worried about people resorting to violent protest and that any conclusion has to be drawn by reading the entire speech. Additional solicitor general K M Natraj contended that the speeches and statements were meant to incite people to resort to violent means of protest against govt and he invoked the name of Gandhi and his principles to shield himself.The bench asked if it is objectionable if someone says that he is worried about people abandoning Gandhian principles and resorting to violence. As govt referred to his various speeches and interviews given in previous years, the bench asked it to refer to only those which led to the violence in Sept last year.The ASG alleged that Sonam Wangchuk tried to internationalise the domestic issue of Ladakh, made statements about referendums and plebiscites, and drew comparisons of Ladakh with Chinese and Pakistani provinces. The apex court had earlier directed the authority to conduct a medical examination of Wangchuk by a specialised doctor and file the report before it. The activist is currently lodged in Jodhpur jail.

"'Why was Puri seeking advice from Epstein?' Congress ups the ante, poses 6 questions",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-was-puri-seeking-advice-from-epstein-congress-ups-the-ante-poses-6-questions/articleshow/128214475.cms,"Pawan Khera

How did Epstein know about Hardeep’s meeting with Reid even before it had happened? Was Epstein the “contact” who set up the meeting with Reid Hoffman? Why was Hardeep discussing the meeting details with him at all? Why was Epstein being addressed as a ‘friend’? What was Epstein making happen for Hardeep? Why was Hardeep seeking ‘advice’ from Epstein if their association was supposedly incidental or superficial?

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Wednesday sharpened its attack on Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri over his remarks on alleged links to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein Party leader Pawan Khera raised six pointed questions and accused the minister of playing down the seriousness of Epstein’s crimes.The row escalated after Puri, responding to Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi , said that he had met Epstein “three or four times” over eight years in a “professional capacity” and that the details were already in the public domain following the release of “three million emails”.Giving context to his attack, Khera referred to an alleged October 4, 2014, email exchange that is part of documents released by the US Department of Justice.Referring to how the interaction allegedly began, he wrote in a post on X, “Today, Hardeep Singh Puri said that his ‘contacts’ introduced him to Reid Hoffman. But what he didn’t say matters more. On October 4, 2014, Epstein emailed Hardeep: ‘Did Reid meeting happen?’ Hardeep replied within hours: ‘I am in SF for meeting this afternoon. You, my friend, make things happen. Any advice?’ Epstein responded: ‘Tell him you will organize his trip to India, to meet with science and tech people and social networking gurus.’”Khera then raised six questions:He also added a post-script which read, “Almost surreal watching Hardeep lose his composure and stutter in anger. Hard to believe this is the same man who once represented India as a diplomat - what a dramatic fall in stature!”In a separate post, Khera accused Puri of trivialising Epstein’s conviction.“Did he just attempt to trivialise Epstein’s crimes? He says that in 2008 Epstein pleaded guilty to ‘soliciting favours of a woman who was underage. That’s it? An ‘underage woman’ is a minor. Basically, a child. And you reduce sexual exploitation of a child to ‘that’s it’? Epstein didn’t just face rumours. He pleaded guilty in a Florida court and was convicted. The crime was established in law. Yet you say ‘many of you had doubts. ’ Doubts about what - his own confession?"" he wrote.The Congress leader strongly criticised what he described as an attempt to downplay the seriousness of Epstein’s conviction and questioned the minister’s remarks on the issue.He wrote, “Must God descend from the heavens personally to confirm Epstein’s crime to you? It is deeply disturbing to hear an Indian Union Minister speak about sexual crimes against minors with such casual detachment. Public office demands moral clarity, not minimisation of abuse. Do us a favour, keep this monstrosity at home, and don't ever come out justifying crimes against women and children like this!”At a press conference at the BJP headquarters, Puri accused Gandhi of making “baseless allegations” and said that his remarks in Parliament had “elements of buffoonery” and “entertainment value”.Clarifying his position, Puri said, “There are references to possibly three or four meetings in eight years… Any contact I had with him has no connection to the serious allegations of sexual abuse filed by victims.”He added, “My interaction had nothing to do with that,” stressing that the meetings were linked to his work as India’s Ambassador to the United Nations and later engagements with the International Peace Institute.The controversy began after Rahul Gandhi claimed he had “verified information” and alleged that “there are Department of Justice files on Epstein naming Hardeep Puri.” The exchange has since triggered a sharp political face-off between the ruling BJP and the Congress.","Party leader Pawan Khera raised six pointed questions and accused the minister of playing down the seriousness of Epstein’s crimes.

However, on a petition by Heena where she challenged the validity of talaq-e-hasan, which she said left Muslim women destitute as there was no provision for maintenance, SC noted that it was handed over to her thro-ugh her husband's counsel.Heena said she could not remarry as she did not have a valid divorce under Muslim personal law. When Shamshad said his client had given her a valid divorce, Ahmed contested this and termed the second round illegal.The bench said, ""There is an urgent and dire necessity to refer parties to mediation for amicable resolution of their marital disputes and whether talaq-e-hasan was given validly and to explore any alternative solution.""It referred the parties for mediation before former SC judge Kurian Joseph, who incidentally was with the majority verdict by a five-judge Constitution bench that declared instant triple talaq unconstitutional in the Shayara Bano case on Aug 22, 2017.In another petition filed by Delhi-based Aasma questioning the validity of talaq-e-hasan given to her, the bench found that her husband, Mohd Anshar, had not responded to the court's notice seeking a response. It directed the SHO of Karawal Nagar to produce Anshar at the next hearing.After SC passed the two orders, Shamshad said it should not give the impression that talaq-e-hasan was an invalid mode of divorce among Muslims.

NEW DELHI: BJP on Wednesday fully matched Rahul Gandhi 's aggression on the floor of Lok Sabha, terming his allegation about govt selling out the national interest in the trade agreement with the US a blatant lie, painting him as a leader filled with bitterness and hatred who would go to any extent to harm the country in his attempt to target the ruling alliance.Hitting out at Rahul, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said it was Congress govt which surrendered India's interest before international organisations, including WTO, and ""sold"" the interest of the poor and farmers. She said the UPA govt had compromised the interest of farmers at Bali on agriculture, and had agreed to the trade facilitation deal, without securing India's interests.She also referred to the Sharm el-Sheikh Joint Statement and accused the Manmohan Singh govt of diluting India's position on sovereignty and security in its engagement with Pakistan.Reacting angrily to Rahul's ""sellout"" charge against PM Narendra Modi, parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju said no ""mai ka laal' has the audacity to do so and lauded Modi as India's strongest PM. Rijiju, who stood up to challenge Rahul's charges against govt and dared him to authenticate his claims, also said that a privilege motion may be brought against the Congress leader for making false allegations. ""You are levelling serious charges without any proof.You are making wild allegations. Please make substantive points,"" he said.BJP, in any case, would not have let Rahul's claims go unchallenged. But on Tuesday, it was enthused by a ""fact-sheet"" issued by the Trump administration which showed that India got better terms than what the bilateral statement suggested.Information and broadcasting minister Ashwini Vaishnav took on Rahul for claiming the deal had compromised the ownership of data, saying it was protected under a strong legal regime.Former Anurag Thakur said in Lok Sabha that successive electoral losses had filled Gandhi with hatred.

BJP MP Counters Rahul Gandhi’s Trade Deal Attack, Anurag Thakur Says Grip Talk Exposed Weakness

NEW DELHI: Minutes after accusing the Centre of having ""sold out Bharat Mata"" from the floor of the House, leader of opposition in Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi , went on to interrupt the ministers outside.The interuption happened when ministers Ashwini Vaishnaw and Prahlad Joshi stood outside the House, speaking to the reporters. Vaishnaw was speaking about the safety of data of the Indians and how Rahul Gandhi should authenticate the statements before making big charges against the Centre in the House.As the IT minister spoke, Rahul Gandhi walked up to him from behind and started speaking.""Come, let's stand together. Let's do it together,"" the Congress leader said as the ministers walked away.Earlier the day, Rahul alleged that the India–US interim trade deal amounted to a ""wholesale surrender"" and accused the Centre of having ""sold Bharat Mata"", compromising the country’s energy security and farmers’ interests.Speaking in the debate on the Union Budget, Rahul said he did not believe that any Indian prime minister, including Narendra Modi, would agree to such a deal unless there was a ""chokehold"" on him.""Why has he (Modi) sold India - because they (the US) are choking him. They have a grip on his neck,"" Gandhi said, beginning his speech with a martial arts analogy in which a grip is followed by a chokehold until the opponent taps out.He referred to earlier remarks by PM Modi and NSA Ajit Doval that the era of war is over. ""In fact, we are moving into the era of war. War is there in Ukraine, war was there in Gaza, war is there in the Middle East, threat of war is there in Iran, we had Operation Sindoor.""""We are moving into a dangerous world. We have to understand our strengths, and the central strength of our country is our people,"" he said, stressing the need to safeguard the country’s people, data, food supply and energy systems.Rahul said that had an INDIA bloc government negotiated the agreement, it would have insisted on parity with the United States.""The first thing we would say (to Trump) is that the most important asset in this equation is Indian data. If the US wants to protect the dollar, it must recognise that Indian data is the biggest asset. Second thing, we would say to President Trump is that ‘if you want access to it, then you will talk to us as an equal, not talk to us as if we are your servants’,"" he said.He added that an INDIA bloc government would have declared energy security non-negotiable. ""The third thing, we would have told President Trump is that ‘we understand you have agricultural voter base, you need to protect farmers, but we will also protect our farmers’,"" he said.""An INDIA bloc government would say that data is our biggest strength, and now let us talk. We would go there (for negotiating) as an equal. We will not be made equal to Pakistan. If President Trump decided that Pakistan Army chief will have breakfast with him, we will have something to say about it,"" he added.Tje Congress claimed that under the interim deal, India’s energy security had effectively been ceded to the US.""They will decide who we buy oil from, our PM will not decide. They will monitor, and if India buys oil (from where they don't want us to), they will punish us and take tariffs to 50 per cent,"" he said.Accusing the government of enabling ""energy and financial weaponisation"", Gandhi said it had allowed Americans to weaponise ""our finance and our energy against us"".""How can you come to this House and defend this? Are you not ashamed of what you are giving away?"" he asked.""I am saying you have sold India. Are you not ashamed of selling India? You have sold our mother - Bharat Mata.

'Either Naravane Or Penguin Is Lying': Rahul Gandhi Reacts To Publisher's Statement On Memoir

What Penguin said

What is the controversial excerpt?

NEW DELHI: Former Indian Army chief Manoj Mukund Naravane, whose unpublished memoir has triggered a major political controversy, on Tuesday backed his publisher Penguin’s statement on the matter.“This is the status of the book,” Naravane wrote on X, sharing a screenshot of Penguin’s statement.General (retired) Naravane’s reaction came a day after the Delhi Police registered an FIR over the circulation of his book, ""Four Stars of Destiny."" An excerpt from the unpublished memoir was sought to be quoted by Lok Sabha leader of opposition and Congress MP Rahul Gandhi in the House on February 2, but he was blocked by the treasury benches, triggering the controversy.The treasury benches argued that House rules do not permit members to cite unpublished material. They also pointed out to Gandhi that he was not speaking on the listed subject — the Motion of Thanks to President Droupadi Murmu’s address, which marked the commencement of Parliament’s Budget session on January 28.The controversy has led to repeated adjournments of the Lok Sabha. Opposition parties have moved a no-confidence motion seeking the removal of Speaker Om Birla, accusing him of repeatedly siding with the government and “blocking” Gandhi from speaking at the government’s behest.As the controversy escalated, Penguin said in a statement on Monday: “We hold the sole publishing rights for the book Four Stars of Destiny.

Amit Shah Confident BJP Will Form Government In Kerala In 2026, Vote Share Climbing

THRISSUR: CPM on Tuesday launched efforts to pacify pro-Left writer and Sahitya Akademi president K Satchidanandan , who caused embarrassment to LDF govt ahead of assembly polls by warning against dangers of returning the same political formation to power repeatedly.Party district secretary K V Abdul Khader and Sahitya Akademi vice-president Asokan Charuvil met Satchidanandan at his residence, in an apparent conciliation bid.After the meeting, Khader and Charuvil sought to underplay the row. According to them, Satchidanandan clarified that he was making a general observation and wasn’t referring specifically to the situation in Kerala. They said Satchidanandan also alleged that media had distorted some of his remarks.However, Satchidanandan said he stood by his statement on the dangers of returning a party to power repeatedly. He said he had personally witnessed the disastrous consequences of such an experience in West Bengal.“I have seen the degeneration of Bengal communist party. As the party came to power repeatedly, more and more corrupt and power-hungry people flocked into the party. Dictatorial tendencies can take a firm grip over a party which remains in power for a long period.This is true, not just for CPM, but for any party,’’ he said.“I wasn’t suggesting a change of ruling party every five years. I’m not referring to a particular time limit at all, but I’m raising my concerns of dangers to democracy if any political formation remains in power for a long period,’’ he said, referring to former finance minister T M Thomas Isaac’s criticisms against him.He chastised suggestions that he shouldn’t criticise govt, which was paying him as president of Sahitya Akademi. “That is only a reminiscence of reactionary thinking that the relationship between Akademi president and govt is akin to feudal landlord and a tenant,’’ he said.Satchidanandan dismissed cyber attacks against him by Left sympathisers, saying, “It is evident that virtual fools’ paradise of cyber crowds didn’t even try to understand the implications of what I was trying to convey and which was completely lost in the verbal bullfight on this Lilliput.”General education minister V Sivankutty alleged that Satchidanandan had criticised without doing proper homework and analysis of political ground realities.Unlike CPM leaders, CPI functionaries took a softer approach to Satchidanandan’s criticisms of ruling LDF. CPI state secretary Binoy Viswam and minister K Rajan said LDF considered Satchidanandan a genuine ally and his criticisms would be heeded with utmost respect. There won’t be any attempt to stifle dissenting voices from friends of the Left like Satchidanandan, they said.Meanwhile, opposition leader V D Satheesan continued to support criticisms by Satchidanandan and activistwriter Sarah Joseph against the CPM-led govt and said the cultural leaders were actually giving voice to the opinions of a vast majority of people.",CPM on Tuesday launched efforts to pacify pro-Left writer and Sahitya Akademi president K Satchidanandan.

Sonam Wangchuk Slams Govt After FCRA Cancellation, Calls It ‘Witch Hunt’

NEW DELHI: The central government on Wednesday opposed Sonam Wangchuk 's release on medical grounds, saying the climate activist was ""hale and hearty and just suffering from a minor infection.""The government said it was not desirable to review Wangchuk's detention as suggested by the court. The Ladakh-based climate activist is detained by authorities under the National Security Act (NSA) in connection with the violent protests in Leh last year, in which four people were killed and more than 150 were injured.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta made the submission before a bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and PB Varale in response to the Supreme Court ’s earlier query, asking the authorities to consider Wangchuk’s release on medical grounds over his deteriorating health issue.“He has been examined periodically some 24 times as per the jail manual. He is fit and hearty. He had a digestive issue, an infection. If we start making such exceptions (to release him), it will not lead to a positive outcome. The grounds on which the detention order was passed continue. It will not be possible to release him on health grounds. It may not be desirable, either. Since it has fallen from your lordships, we have given utmost consideration, ” Tushar Mehta, representing the government, told the Supreme Court.Observing that the medical condition of climate activist Sonam Wangchuk, who has been in detention for more than four months, is not very good, the Supreme Court had asked the Centre last week to rethink/relook its decision to continue to keep him in custody.SC had earlier directed authorities to conduct Wangchuk’s medical examination by a specialised doctor and file a report before it. The activist is currently lodged in Jodhpur jail. The medical report was placed before the apex court during the last hearing.Wangchuk was detained on September 26 last year under the National Security Act following protests in Leh over demands of statehood and Sixth Schedule status for Ladakh. SC is hearing the plea moved by Wangchuk’s wife, Gitanjali Angmo, against his preventive detention.Earlier, the government had told the court that the activist was trying to create political and social turmoil and unrest in Ladakh, and was making an attempt to emulate what happened in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal.",The government said it was not desirable to review Wangchuk's detention as suggested by the court.

Error in opposition notice to remove LS Speaker; Birla intervenes to correct errors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/error-in-opposition-notice-to-remove-ls-speaker-birla-intervenes-to-correct-errors/articleshow/128200629.cms,"No-Confidence Against Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla Explained: Process, Rules And Numbers In Parliament

Why was the no-confidence motion submitted?

NEW DELHI: The Opposition’s no-confidence motion against Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla , submitted by Congress and backed by 118 MPs, has hit a procedural snag even before it can be formally tabled. ANI sources highlighted the specific technical shortcomings in the notice that could have led to its outright rejection under Lok Sabha rules.However, despite the shortcomings, the Speaker has asked the Lok Sabha Secretariat to get the 'faulty' notice to remove him ""rectified"" to prevent its rejection.News agency ANI, citing its sources, revealed that the notice repeatedly referenced events from February 2025 and had the incidents mentioned a full four times. The notice should have had the incidents from the ongoing Budget Session cited accurately.This clerical error pertaining to dates is a serious procedural lapses Lok Sabha rules mandate precision in such submissions; any ambiguity or factual inaccuracy in the notice can provide grounds for the Speaker to dismiss it summarily without further consideration.Speaker Om Birla, however, has refrained from rejecting the motion outright based on these shortcomings and instead issued clear instructions to the Secretariat to facilitate corrections and advance the process “expeditiously” as per established parliamentary norms.On what ANI sources describe as principled “moral grounds,” Birla has voluntarily decided to recuse himself from presiding over Lok Sabha proceedings until the no-confidence motion against him is fully resolved, a move that underscores his intent to maintain the House's impartiality during this sensitive period.The revised notice, once submitted, will undergo prompt examination in accordance with the rules and is slated for listing after the second phase of the Budget Session commences — with discussions likely kicking off on March 9, the very first day of that part, according to Lok Sabha Secretariat insiders.The Congress-led Opposition, excluding the TMC, levelled serious charges of “blatantly partisan” conduct against Speaker Birla, accusing him of systematically stifling their voices in the House and filed the motion citing four specific, high-profile incidents from the recent Budget Session.They pointed to the denial of permission for Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi to speak on February 2 during the crucial Motion of Thanks debate on the President’s Address, particularly when he sought to reference former Army chief General MM Naravane’s revelations about the 2020 India-China border aggression in Ladakh — a moment the Opposition views as a deliberate muzzling of critical national security discourse.Birla’s public observation, made a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi skipped his scheduled reply to the Motion of Thanks, deemed a group of Congress women MPs as “posing a threat” to the PM and could precipitate an “unprecedented incident."" This was remarked as biased and inflammatory by the opposition.Also, the suspension of eight Opposition MPs, the opposition argues, was disproportionately harsh and reflective of the Speaker’s one-sided enforcement of House discipline.The opposition also claimed the Speaker had selective tolerance, citing Birla's alleged inaction against BJP MP Nishikant Dubey, who reportedly unleashed “wholly objectionable and personalised attacks” targeting two former Prime Ministers, despite repeated demands from Opposition benches for reprimand or further action.",The Opposition’s no-confidence motion against Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla has hit a procedural snag even before it can be formally tabled.

AHMEDABAD: A nurse who worked at multiple IVF centres and gynaecology hospitals in Ahmedabad and Hyderabad is under scanner for allegedly facilitating an inter-state child trafficking racket for nearly two years. Crime branch officials said she acted as a key link between hospitals and agents in Hyderabad, Pune and Ahmedabad, and later began directly approaching childless couples.According to investigators, the woman, who is from Ahmedabad, worked for around a decade at leading IVF centres in Hyderabad and the city. During this period, she established contacts with doctors and fertility clinic owners. Police said she gradually built a network of IVF centres and prospective parents seeking children.After quitting her job, she allegedly used her professional knowledge of IVF procedures to gain the trust of couples and coordinate the supply of infants through agents. A senior police officer said she travelled to tribal pockets of north Gujarat, including Poshina, Kheroj, Idar, Danta and Deesa, where she identified vulnerable women who were about to deliver children out of wedlock.Investigators said at least 20 tribal infants were trafficked and sold to buyers in Hyderabad over the past two years.The racket came to light on Jan 29 when four accused were intercepted near Ahmedabad airport while transporting a 15-day-old baby to Hyderabad for resale. Subsequent investigations led to the arrest of the alleged kingpin, Yunus Sindhi, from Danta.Police said infants were priced based on skin colour and gender, with fair-skinned babies sold for up to Rs 7 lakh and others for Rs 2-3 lakh. Baby boys reportedly fetched higher rates.Officials said shifting social norms in tribal communities, where children born out of wedlock now faced stigma, were exploited by the traffickers. The probe is now focused on the money trail, identifying buyers in Hyderabad, and examining the role of IVF centres that allegedly connected childless couples with the racket network.","Nurse worked at multiple IVF centres and gynaecology hospitals in Ahmedabad and Hyderabad.

ALWAR: An Additional District and Sessions Court of Bharatpur Wednesday delivered a verdict in a high-profile murder and assault case that dates back a decade. The court found 23 persons from two feuding families guilty, sentencing 12 to life imprisonment for murder and the remaining 11 to seven years for assault.Additional public prosecutor Dharmendra Kumar said the case traces its roots to a violent altercation that erupted on Aug 16, 2015, in Pipla village, located within the jurisdiction of Chiksana police station of Bharatpur district. The altercation was fueled by political tensions between the families, which escalated into an act of violence involving gunfire.According to the FIR filed by Dayachand, his nephew Rakesh was standing at the village bus stand when Saudan Singh and his family members allegedly assaulted him. When Rakesh's relatives intervened, they were also attacked. The complaint alleged that Singh shot Rakesh, killing him on the spot, and that other family members sustained injuries.Dayachand named 15 accused, including Saudan Singh, Gulab, Mukesh, Horilal, Guddu, Kartar, Charan Singh, Omi, Lakhan, Bhagwan Singh, Raghuvir, Mahesh, Khajan, Bhoja and Raju. Police later filed a chargesheet against all 15 accused.During the proceedings, Bhoja, Saudan and Raju died but the court pronounced them guilty, while sentencing the remaining 12 accused to life imprisonment for murder.A counter-FIR was also filed the same day by Shyamlal, alleging that Dayachand and his family members attacked his side and injured several people. Shyamlal's FIR named 54 people, but police identified 11 accused during investigation. These included Tejpal, Atal Bihari, Tej Singh, Tikam, Dayachand, Raghuvir, Prabhu, Virendra, Charan Singh, Dinesh and Narendra. The court convicted all 11 for assault and sentenced each to seven years' imprisonment.The courtroom number-3 was filled with a tense atmosphere as a large crowd from both families congregated to hear the verdict, reflecting the two sides' deep divisions that have lingered since the altercation.","The court found 23 persons from two feuding families guilty, sentencing 12 to life imprisonment for murder and the remaining 11 to seven years for assault.

NEW DELHI: Over a year ago, they were hailed as the generation that brought down a prime minister. Today, many of the young faces of Bangladesh's 2024 uprising are confronting a harsher reality. Turning revolution into governance is tough. Tougher than leading a protest.The student-led National Citizen Party (NCP) emerged from the mass movement that forced Sheikh Hasina from power after a deadly crackdown.The uprising, sparked by anger over civil service job quotas and fuelled by outrage at police violence, spread rapidly across Dhaka and beyond. According to the United Nations, up to 1,400 people were killed, most in the security crackdown ordered by Hasina.The movement was celebrated globally as a rare, successful Gen Z revolt.But as national elections approach in February, the NCP is struggling to translate its moral authority into electoral strength. Opinion polls put the party at around six per cent support, far behind established players. Internal fractures, scarce resources and limited grassroots networks have exposed how thin the party’s organisational base remains.For many of its young leaders, the shift from agitation to administration has been disorienting. Some held advisory roles in the interim government that followed Hasina’s exit, hoping to shape what one activist described to the BBC as a “beautiful Bangladesh based on peace, equality, justice and fairness”. Instead, disappointment has set in.Rahat Hossain, 24, whose attempt to drag a wounded friend to safety during the crackdown went viral, told the BBC that the promise of the uprising feels unfulfilled. His friend, Emam Hasan Taim Bhuiyan, was shot and later died in hospital. Hossain himself was injured. For many like him, the revolution was deeply personal. Now, political compromise feels jarring.The NCP’s decision to form an alliance with Jamaat-e-Islami has intensified tensions. Party officials argue the partnership is pragmatic, aimed at leveraging Jamaat’s grassroots strength. “We were hoping to do a lot better,” Asif Mahmud, chairman of the NCP’s Election Committee, told the BBC, acknowledging the uphill battle. He insisted the alliance is not ideological but strategic.Yet the move has alienated several prominent women in the party. Of the candidates Jamaat is allowing the NCP to field, only two are women, prompting resignations from senior female leaders who called it a “moral red line”. Critics within the movement say the gender imbalance betrays the inclusive spirit of the protests, in which women played a central role.At the same time, the ban on Hasina’s Awami League has reshaped the electoral field. The Bangladesh Nationalist Party is leading in polls and presenting itself as a liberal democratic alternative, while Jamaat has gained momentum, particularly among younger voters who do not see its 1971 legacy as decisive. With established parties filling the vacuum, the NCP risks being squeezed out.Business leaders and international partners are watching closely. Bangladesh’s garment industry, a pillar of the economy, depends on political stability. Uncertainty surrounding the Awami League’s exclusion and warnings of unrest add to the fragility.For the young revolutionaries, the dilemma is stark. Align too closely with older forces and lose their distinct identity. Stand alone and risk irrelevance. Whether the NCP becomes a durable political force or a fleeting product of upheaval will depend on whether it can build structures, articulate clear positions, and regain the trust of those who once marched behind it. The factors, for now, appear reasonably unattainable.","The student-led National Citizen Party (NCP) emerged from the mass movement that forced Sheikh Hasina from power. Opinion polls put the party at around six per cent support, far behind established players. Internal fractures, scarce resources and limited grassroots networks have exposed how thin the party’s organisational base remains.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128214922,imgsize-76682,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-17.jpg"

MEERUT: It was meant to be a picture-perfect wedding — a constable set to marry a fellow constable in a match arranged by their families. Invitations had gone out, preparations were complete, and the stage was set for the ceremony.Then, on Saturday, a night before the wedding, the 25-year-old bride-to-be, Sandhya Bhardwaj, vanished.Bhardwaj, who hailed from Akbarpur Sadat village in Meerut's Bahsuma region, walked out of her home and disappeared.Unaware of her whereabouts, her father, Subhash Sharma, approached police on Sunday, alleging that Ankit Chauhan, 28, a history-sheeter facing nine criminal cases, including robbery and murder, had abducted his daughter. He said she had taken 20 days' leave for her wedding to Atul Sharma, a constable from Muzaffarnagar, and had returned home from her posting at the cyber police station in Aligarh.""On Feb 5, Chauhan threatened the groom over the phone, saying he would kill him if he married my daughter. On Saturday night, he abducted her,"" Sharma alleged in his complaint. An FIR was subsequently registered against Chauhan under BNS sections 87 (kidnapping) and 351(2) (criminal intimidation).Police traced Bhardwaj within eight hours to Buxar in Meerut. When questioned, however, the case took a dramatic turn. She denied being abducted and told police she had left of her own accord.Investigators said Bhardwaj had known Chauhan for the past few years. ""She met him during visits to her aunt's house in Dhikoli village, from where Chauhan hails,"" said Mawana circle officer (CO) Pankaj Lavania.Chauhan's record, police said, includes several cases of loot and murder. Last May, he was arrested following a police encounter in connection with a liquor shop robbery and was recently released on bail.As the stunned groom called off the wedding, the bride remained firm, asserting her right to choose, even if her choice stood in stark contrast to the uniform she wears. SP (rural) Abhijeet Kumar said she would soon be produced before a court.","Sandhya Bhardwaj, 25, walked out of her home and disappeared on Saturday.

A history teacher at a South Los Angeles charter high school has been terminated after opening a campus gate to allow students to exit during a student-led anti-ICE protest, a move he says was intended to prevent injuries.Ricardo Lopez, who taught US History at Synergy Quantum Charter High School, said he unlatched a fence last week after witnessing students attempting to scale it to join coordinated walkouts taking place across Southern California.“I was just concerned about their safety,” Lopez told local media. “As the closest adult to them, I just opened the gate.”According to Lopez, he had observed students injure themselves the previous day while climbing over the fence. When similar attempts resumed, he intervened to prevent further harm. Within an hour of the incident, he was reportedly dismissed for what the school described as “insubordination.”Lopez said he was escorted off campus shortly after and later received his personal belongings — including student artwork and classroom materials — boxed and delivered to his residence.Synergy Academies confirmed that Lopez is no longer employed at the school.In a statement, the administration said it respects students’ rights to express themselves but emphasized adherence to Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) campus access and safety policies.“Decisions about whether students may leave campus during the school day are made solely by school administration,” the statement said, noting that the charter school operates on an LAUSD campus and follows district security protocols.Last week, district officials had issued advisories discouraging students from leaving campus during school hours amid the protests.However, Lopez’s dismissal has sparked backlash from students and parents, who have held rallies outside the school demanding his reinstatement.A petition calling for his return has garnered nearly 1,000 signatures, while a crowdfunding campaign describes his actions as an attempt to prioritise student safety over strict protocol.Students have said Lopez did not encourage them to participate in the walkout and that they acted independently. Several parents, while expressing reservations about students leaving class, have termed the termination “excessive.”Community groups, including Unión del Barrio and the Association of Raza Educators, have also voiced support.“I just want to get back to my classroom and students,” Lopez said, adding that upcoming AP examinations make the timing particularly difficult.As of now, the school has not indicated whether the decision will be reconsidered.","Ricardo Lopez, who taught US History at Synergy Quantum Charter High School, said he unlatched a fence last week after witnessing students attempting to scale it.

Bhubaneswar: Industrial Boost, Caste Boycott, Tragic Elephant Attack & Hockey Heroics





KENDRAPADA: In a stark reminder of prevailing caste prejudice in rural Odisha, parents have stopped sending their children to an anganwadi centre after an educated dalit girl was appointed as helper-cum-cook, forcing the centre to remain shut for nearly three months.Authorities had appointed Sarmista Sethi (23), a graduate, as an anganwadi helper at the Nuagaon centre under Ghadiamala gram panchayat in Rajnagar block about four months back. Soon after, the village committee, consisting mostly members from the upper caste, decided not to send children to the centre in protest against her appointment. Officials are yet to break the deadlock, leaving the fate of around 60 children hanging in balance.Around 45 families, including seven dalit families, live in this riverside village. Sarmista faced open resistance from parents who told anganwadi worker Lizarani Pandav, an upper-caste woman, that their children would not have food prepared by a dalit woman. The village committee head also reportedly instructed families — including the dalit households— not to send their children to the centre.“I was posted on Nov 24, 2025. Some upper-caste villagers warned me not to cook for the kids.When I refused to obey, they stopped sending their children to the centre. Even the women have stopped coming,” said Sarmista.Sailendra Mishra, sarpanch of Ghadiamala panchayat said they had urged the village head and others to send the children to the centre. “But they didn’t listen. Pregnant women have also been avoiding the centre and losing out on crucial health benefits,” the sarpanch said.Lizarani said she has informed the chief development project officer (CDPO) of Rajnagar block, who assured her that action would be taken against those preventing children and pregnant women from visiting the centre.CDPO Dipali Mishra said many upper-caste parents opposed the idea of their children eating food cooked by a dalit woman. “We have been trying to convince them. Me, along with the Rajnagar tehsildar, held discussions with villagers on Tuesday, but the issue remains unresolved,” she said.Ramakanta Das, a villager, said many parents did not want their children to consume food prepared by the dalit woman. “So they decided not to send them to the centre,” Ramakanta said.On Tuesday, a team of dalit leaders visited the village and alleged administrative inaction against those who illegally prevented children and women from attending the anganwadi centre. “The Supreme Court, in its interim order dated April 20, 2004, in PUCL vs Government of India, had clearly stated that SC/ST candidates should be given priority as cooks in midday meals,” said Nagen Jena, district president of Dalit Samaj.Kendrapada district collector Raghuram R Iyer said after learning about the incident, he directed the district social welfare officer to submit a detailed report. “Action will be taken against those who barred children and others from attending the centre on the pretext of a dalit girl’s appointment. We are also trying to resolve the matter amicably,” the collector said.","Authorities had appointed Sarmista Sethi (23), a graduate, as an anganwadi helper at the Nuagaon centre under Ghadiamala gram panchayat in Rajnagar block about four months back.

MUMBAI: A fortnight after gunshots were fired outside filmmaker Rohit Shetty's residence in Juhu, actor Ranveer Singh was learnt to have received a threat accompanied by a demand for several crores.Sources said the threat was sent as a WhatsApp voice note from an unidentified number to Singh's secretary. The sender claimed to be speaking on behalf of the Bishnoi gang.Security around Singh's residence was increased after the voice note, said police sources.In a related development, the managing committee of the Beau Monde residential tower in Prabhadevi approached the Dadar police station about the deployment of six armed private security guards without the permission of the society at the flat occupied by Singh and his actor wife Deepika Padukone. In a written communication, the society said suddenly now a uniformed police official was also seen stationed with the actors.Though senior police officials remained tight-lipped on the extortion matter, sources said Singh was not an isolated target. Over the past 15 days, about a dozen Bollywood personalities are said to have received threatening calls from people who identified themselves as members of the Bishnoi gang.No complaint or FIR has been registered so far by any of the threatened celebrities.The latest threat comes even as the crime branch is struggling to nab the unidentified shooter who fired five rounds outside Shetty's home last month.On Feb 5, TOI was the first to report the surge in threat calls undert the headline ‘5 More Bollywood celebrities targeted by Lonkar: Cops'.Investigators said that soon after the firing at Shetty's house, several Bollywood figures began receiving extortion calls. Most of them reportedly blocked unknown numbers or stopped answering unfamiliar calls altogether.Even Singh's secretary is believed to have blocked unknown callers, which may have prompted the extortionist to send a voice note directly to the assistant's phone.The growing menace of the Bishnoi gang — particularly after the firing outside Salman Khan's residence, the murder of NCP leader Baba Siddiqui last year, and the attack on Shetty's house — has gripped Mumbai's film fraternity with fear, evoking memories of the 1990s and early 2000s when underworld influence, shootouts and threat calls were rampant.At least nine teams of the crime branch are camping in Lucknow and adjoining towns in Uttar Pradesh to track down the shooter involved in the Shetty firing case. A police official told TOI that the shooter had been identified and digitally tracked to Lucknow, and efforts are underway to arrest him at the earliest.",Ranveer Singh received a threat accompanied by a demand for several crores.

NEW DELHI: A 30-year-old labourer died after allegedly falling into an open sewer manhole in Rohini's Begumpur area. Though a rescue operation was launched by police and fire department, the man could not be saved on Tuesday.The incident occurred near Mahashakti Kali Temple in Sector 32, Rohini, on a vacant plot. Police identified the victim as Birju Kumar, a resident of Bihar's Samastipur, who was working as a labourer at an under-construction building.According to police, a PCR call was received at Begumpur police station around 2.36pm reporting that a man was missing and was suspected to have fallen into an open sewer. ""When police teams reached the spot, they were informed that Birju and friend Budhan Das had been drinking and were walking towards their jhuggi on Monday evening when the incident took place. The plot of land belongs to DDA,"" a police officer said.""Birju's friend told police that both of them had consumed alcohol and were walking in an inebriated state around 7.30pm. He said Birju suddenly lost balance and fell into the open manhole. The friend initially lost consciousness due to intoxication and later realised that Birju had fallen into the drain,"" the police officer added. The next morning, Budhan Das informed his another friend, Amir Hussain, about the incident.Police said the manhole was about 14 feet deep and around two feet in diameter. An ambulance and water extraction equipment were rushed to the site after DDA and other agencies were alerted. Rescue personnel launched a search operation and eventually recovered Birju from the pit. Delhi Fire Services received a call regarding the incident around 7.45pm, after which they pulled out the man in an unconscious state.He was taken to a nearby hospital, where doctors declared him dead. Following the incident, DDA officials covered the open manhole to prevent further accidents.

Stillborn girl with rare congenital defect declared 'goddess Kali',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/stillborn-girl-with-rare-congenital-defect-declared-goddess-kali/articleshow/128238908.cms,"



Agra: In a quiet nondescript village in UP's Mainpuri district, grief has given way to fervour. A baby girl declared stillborn by doctors and diagnosed with a fatal congenital condition has been proclaimed by her family as an ""incarnation of Goddess Kali"". The child was embalmed and buried on Feb 2. Soon, the burial site was decorated, a photograph of the ""goddess"" was installed, and bhajans, kirtans and havans began to be held regularly. Villagers said that thousands of rupees have been offered at the spot and preparations are underway to construct a temple there.Radha Devi, 25, wife of Kanchan Kumar, a labourer from Halpura village, delivered the baby at community health centre (CHC) in Kuchela on Jan 21. The family said the birth had been foretold in a dream in which a goddess told Radha: ""I am taking birth from your womb."" Treating the dream as a 'divine sign', they shared the account with neighbours and word quickly spread across surrounding areas.CHC in-charge Dr SS Bhadoria said, ""The woman delivered a stillborn baby girl and the body was handed over to the family.""Medical experts identified the condition as anencephaly -- a severe and fatal congenital disorder in which major portions of the brain and skull do not develop.Paediatrician Dr Hemant Kumar Sharma said on Wednesday, ""The condition develops in the early weeks of pregnancy and may be linked to several factors, including maternal weakness or deficiencies such as Vitamin B12 or folic acid.""Despite the medical explanation, belief took root in the village. Geeta Devi, a neighbour, claimed that after the baby was brought home, she drank milk and urinated before being dressed as goddess Kali and seated for worship. Another neighbour, Aman, said the child appeared divine and that she had asked for a place of worship.Residents from nearby villages, as well as towns such as Etawah, Firozabad and Shikohabad, visited the site. Some said the baby's large eyes reinforced their belief that she was a manifestation of the goddess.A similar episode occurred in 2017 in Farrukhabad district, where a baby born with severe congenital deformities was declared stillborn at Lohia Govt Hospital and diagnosed with anencephaly. At the time, some residents attributed religious significance to the incident and even expressed intentions to build a temple in remembrance.(With inputs fromPunit Lal)","Radha Devi, 25, wife of Kanchan Kumar, a labourer from Halpura village, delivered the baby at community health centre (CHC) in Kuchela on Jan 21.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt was pressed on Tuesday on whether the administration is facing a “social media problem” after two controversial posts, one from President Donald Trump’s Truth Social account and another from Vice President JD Vance’s X account, were posted and then deleted within days of each other.The question followed backlash over a Truth Social post shared by Trump last Thursday evening. The video repeated baseless conspiracy theories about the 2020 election and ended with a short clip showing former President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama with their faces superimposed onto apes’ bodies. The post drew swift condemnation from lawmakers across party lines, media figures, and political commentators, who criticised it as racist.Leavitt initially defended the video, describing it as an “Internet meme video depicting President Trump as the King of the Jungle,” and dismissed criticism as “fake outrage.” However, shortly before noon ET on Friday, the post was removed. The White House later said the video had been shared by a still-unnamed staffer and described the post as “erroneous.”Days later, another deletion reignited scrutiny. On Tuesday, Vance’s official X account briefly posted a message that included a photo of the vice president and Second Lady Usha Vance at what was described as “a wreath laying ceremony at the Armenian Genocide memorial to honour the victims of the 1915 Armenian genocide.”The tweet was subsequently deleted.An official from Vance’s office said the post was “posted in error” by a staffer who was not travelling with the vice president’s delegation. US under the Trump administration policy, which does not use the word “genocide” for the 1915 event.As per estimates of CNN, Armenian deaths range from 300,000 to 2 million between 1914 and 1923, with most figures falling between 600,000 and 1.5 million. Ottoman authorities themselves estimated that 800,000 Armenians were killed between 1915 and 1918. Whether through mass killings or forced deportations, the Armenian population in Turkey dropped from roughly 2 million in 1914 to fewer than 400,000 by 1922.The Armenian National Committee of America sharply criticised the deletion of Vance’s post, calling it “disgraceful” and labelling it “a denialist action consistent with President Trump’s shameful retreat from honest American remembrance of a crime recognised by all 50 states, the US Congress, the White House, and more than a dozen of our NATO allies.”The issue came to a head during Tuesday’s White House briefing, when Danny Kemp, the White House correspondent for Agence France-Presse, questioned Leavitt directly.“Today, the Vice President’s account posted and then deleted a tweet about the Armenian genocide, and then last week, President Trump’s Truth Social account posted and then deleted a racist video about the Obamas,” Kemp said. “And the White House, again, blamed that on a staffer. I wanted to ask you, does the White House have a social media problem at the moment? Do you have an auto-posting problem that’s leading to these mistakes?”“No,” Leavitt replied. “As for the Armenian tweet that you’re referring to, I would just refer you back to the White House’s message that was issued on Armenian Remembrance Day, and there’s been no change of policy at this time.”","White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt was pressed on Tuesday on whether the administration is facing a “social media problem” The question followed backlash over a Truth Social post shared by Trump last Thursday evening.

JD Vance and Wife Usha Booed on Global Stage as Milan Olympics Turn Hostile





US Vice President JD Vance seemingly hinted at his 2028 Presidency while delivering a press statement with Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev on February 10, 2026. The 41-year-old quipped about Usha Vance ""getting ideas"" to become Vice President during his term, akin to Aliyev's wife, Mehriban Aliyeva.Vance who is married to Indian-origin attorney Usha Vance arrived in Azerbaijan on Tuesday from Armenia. He is travelling with his wife and three kids on a regional trip aimed at formalising a US-brokered peace process between the neighbouring countries.Thanking the Azerbaijan President for his welcoming statement Vance began by appreciating the country's support in the 'global war on terrorism'. ""I think many Americans may not know that, for example, the Azerbaijanis were some of the last to leave Afghanistan.""He announced America's collaboration to help the Eurasian country protect its territorial waters and to ensure that the peace agreement between the two countries ""sticks"". He also commended Aliyev for being the only leader in the world after Trump to have ""good relations"" with both Turks and Israelis.While ending his speech, he shared his and Usha's excitement for the upcoming dinner. Vance also pointed out that the President's wife, Mehriban Aliyeva, was the Vice-President of the country and joked about Usha getting inspiration from the same, hinting at his own presidential dreams which have been known and promoted in the US by people including Trump and Erika Kirk.""And as I understand it, the Vice-President of Azerbaijan is also the President's wife, and hopefully that doesn't give the Second Lady any ideas,"" he said to a crowd that erupted in laughter.In 2017, the Azerbaijani President created the position of Vice President in the country and signed an order appointing his wife as the First Vice-President. While America already has the position, currently occupied by Vance himself, the Republican has hinted at his wife's possible foray into politics alongside him.Ilham Aliyev initiated the event by welcoming Vance to Azerbaijan and thanking the Trump administration for its ""positive attitude"" towards the country. He went on to share that Azerbaijan has now lifted all restrictions on transit cargo to Armenia and has also started to supply oil products to the Caucasus neighbour. ""In other words, today's visit of Vice President Vance can be called historical, from the point of view of hosting our friend and guest, and from the point of view of the substance of negotiations and the Strategic Charter which has been signed. Once again, Mr. Vice President, welcome to Azerbaijan,"" he said.Vance's visit follows US President Donald Trump's mediation in 2025 for a peace agreement between the historical rivals Baku and Yerevan who have fought two wars over the region of Karabakh. Trump brokered an agreement between the countries to commit to renouncing claims on each other's territory and refrain from using force. Azerbaijan seized the region in 2023 and ended three decades of rule by Armenian separatists. Prior to coming to Azerbaijan, Vance met Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan in Yerevan.

Fiery showdown over Epstein files: Pam Bondi vs lawmakers — 5 key moments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fiery-showdown-over-epstein-files-pam-bondi-vs-lawmakers-5-key-moments/articleshow/128236277.cms,"'Shut Up, You Washed-up Loser Lawyer!': Raskin, Nadler Ambush Pam Bondi Over Epstein Action

Survivors in the room — and a refusal to apologise



The Massie clash: 'Bigger than Watergate'



Trump takes centre stage



Misfires and walkouts



A rare moment of unity over threats







Attorney General Pam Bondi’s appearance before the House Judiciary Committee was meant to steady the ship after months of controversy over the Justice Department’s handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files. Instead, it descended into one of the most combative hearings of her tenure.For more than four hours, Bondi faced furious questioning from Democrats and pointed scrutiny from at least one Republican over redactions, the exposure of victims’ personal details, and accusations of a political cover-up. With Epstein survivors seated directly behind her, the optics were stark. Lawmakers accused the department of failing both transparency and basic care for victims.Bondi, however, chose confrontation over contrition. She forcefully defended President Donald Trump , dismissed allegations of a cover-up, and repeatedly clashed with members of the committee. Here are five key moments that defined the hearing.One of the most powerful moments came early, when Democratic Representative Pramila Jayapal asked Epstein survivors seated in the hearing room to stand. She then pressed Bondi to apologise not only for the abuse they endured — which Bondi had acknowledged in her opening remarks — but for the Justice Department’s failure to properly redact sensitive information in the released files.Bondi declined to apologise for the redaction failures. Instead, she accused Jayapal of engaging in “theatrics” and said officials had done their “very best in the time frame allotted” under the legislation mandating release of the files. She insisted that any information released inadvertently had been “immediately redacted” once identified.At one point, when urged again to address the survivors behind her, Bondi refused to turn around, saying she would not “get in the gutter”. The moment underscored the central tension of the hearing: whether the department had prioritised speed and politics over victims’ dignity.While Democrats hammered Bondi, one of the most striking exchanges came from Republican Representative Thomas Massie, who helped push the legislation forcing disclosure of the Epstein files.Massie accused the department of improperly redacting names of individuals who were not legally entitled to protection. He specifically raised the case of billionaire Les Wexner, whose name had initially been blacked out in a section referencing potential criminal conduct.Bondi responded that Wexner’s name had been restored “within 40 minutes”. Massie shot back: “Within 40 minutes of me catching you red-handed.”Calling the issue “bigger than Watergate”, Massie argued the handling of the files reflected a cover-up spanning multiple administrations. Bondi dismissed his line of questioning as a “political joke” and accused him of being a “failed politician” with “Trump derangement syndrome”.The exchange cut through the broader partisan noise. Unlike many Democratic attacks that dissolved into shouting matches, Massie’s questioning directly challenged the department’s credibility on specific redactions — and left Bondi on the defensive.Though the hearing was about Epstein, it frequently became a platform for Bondi to defend President Trump.“You sit here and you attack the president and I’m not going to have it,” she told lawmakers. At another point she declared, “There is no evidence that Donald Trump has committed a crime. Everyone knows that.”When Democratic Representative Ted Lieu referenced unsubstantiated tips in the files mentioning Trump, Bondi angrily replied: “Don’t you ever accuse me of committing a crime,” after Lieu suggested she was misleading the committee.Bondi also praised the stock market’s performance under Trump, citing record highs in the Dow and Nasdaq, and suggested lawmakers should focus on that instead. Critics quickly noted that market performance was not the Judiciary Committee’s remit.Her repeated alignment with Trump marked a departure from traditional Justice Department distance from the White House. Rather than positioning herself as an independent law enforcement official, Bondi openly cast herself as the president’s defender.Bondi’s aggressive approach did not always land cleanly.In one exchange, she criticised Democratic Representative Becca Balint over a vote related to antisemitism. Balint responded that she was the granddaughter of a Holocaust victim and shouted, “Are you serious?” before storming out of the hearing.Bondi also sparred with Jamie Raskin, the committee’s top Democrat, calling him a “washed-up loser lawyer” during a heated exchange over time limits and questioning tactics.Meanwhile, Democrats repeatedly accused her of running a “massive Epstein cover-up” and siding with perpetrators over victims. They also pointed to the department’s recent attempt — rejected by a grand jury — to indict Democratic lawmakers, fuelling claims of political weaponisation.Bondi insisted the department was focused on reducing violent crime and restoring its “core missions” after what she described as years of politicisation. But by the end of the session, it was clear she had not come to concede ground.Amid the rancour, there was a brief pause in hostilities.Democratic Representative Eric Swalwell shifted the focus to threats made against him and his family. He asked Bondi whether they were being investigated and appealed for help in protecting lawmakers’ families in an increasingly volatile political climate.Bondi responded: “None of you should be threatened ever. None of your children should be threatened. None of your families should be threatened, and I will work with you.”","Attorney General Pam Bondi's appearance before the House Judiciary Committee descended into one of the most combative hearings of her tenure.

US President Donald Trump said no final agreement was reached for a nuclear deal after having a three-hour meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and warned Iran of consequences if negotiations failed.In a post on Truth Social, Trump said that he insisted to Israeli PM Netanyahu during their White House meeting Wednesday that negotiations with Iran continue.“It was a very good meeting, the tremendous relationship between our two Countries continues.” Trump said in a social media post. “There was nothing definitive reached other than I insisted that negotiations with Iran continue to see whether or not a Deal can be consummated.Trump also referred to past US military action against Iran, warning of consequences if negotiations failed.""Last time Iran decided that they were better off not making a deal, they were hit with Midnight Hammer — that did not work well for them,"" he said, referring to the June 2025 US strikes on Iran’s three main nuclear sites.""Hopefully this time they will be more reasonable and responsible,"" he added.The US President said the leaders also discussed the war in Gaza and wider developments in the Middle East.Iran continued to reel from the 12-day war with Israel in June, after a series of airstrikes, including the US bombing of several Iranian nuclear sites, killed nearly 1,000 people in Iran and almost 40 in Israel.Israel long called for Iran to cease all uranium enrichment, dial back its ballistic missile programme and cut ties to militant groups across the region. Iran always rejected those demands, saying it would only accept some limits on its nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief.Washington built up military forces in the region, sending an aircraft carrier, guided-missile destroyers, air defence assets and more to supplement its presence. Arab and Islamic countries, including Turkey and Qatar, urged both sides to show restraint, warning that any strike or retaliation could have destabilising consequences for a region already strained by the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.","US President Donald Trump said no final agreement was reached for a nuclear deal with Iran.

Greg Steube's proposed Exile Act is the latest in the list of legislation proposing to end the H-1B visa program. In the past few months, several US lawmakers came up with similar proposals under different names -- all targeting the visa program that allows US companies to hire skilled specialty workers fromforeign countries.Republican lawmaker representing Florida's 17th Congressional District, Greg Steube, proposed the Act, EXILE stands for Ending Exploitative Imported Labor Exemptions. It aims to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act by ending the visa program. This legislation proposes to reduce the number of H-1B visas to zero at the beginning of the financial year 2027.In November 2025, Republican Rep Chip Roy (Texas) proposed freezing all immigration. PAUSE stands for Pausing on Admissions Until Security Ensured. It is not targeted at H-1B but all immigration but it cals for terminating the H-1B category. It also proposed canceling OPT which allows F-1 students to work in their fields after their studies.Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Dick Durbin (D-IL) introduced the H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act of 2025, a bill seeking to toughen the criteria for these visa categories.For example, their proposal said a foreign national should have a US Bachelor's degree or a foreign equivalent degree in a specific specialty that is “directly related” to the occupation.Former Congress Rep Marjorie Taylor Greene, before her exit from Congress, introduced End H-1B Now Act in January 2026. She proposed the elimination of the H-1B visa program with an exemption for medical professionals.All these are in the state of 'introduced,' and none passed the House, Senate, and are seen more as a political statements and unlikely to become law.","Republican lawmaker representing Florida's 17th Congressional District, Greg Steube, proposed the Act, EXILE.

FAA announced a 10-day airspace shutdown around border city El Paso in Texas only to cancel it within hours after confirming that the threat was neutralized. The sudden closure of the airspace led to panic as local officials said they were not aware of anything. The sudden lifting of the shutdown also spread fear about any aviation risk involving Mexico cartel drone.

""The Mexican airspace did not close... We will learn what the reasons are for why the airspace closed,"" she said.CNN reported that a Pentagon plan to use a high-energy, counter-drone laser prompted the unprecedented airspace shutdown over El Paso.But it was not confirmed whether the Pentagon used the new technology or whether there was a test.The new technology is being tested in remote areas of the country and FAA and Pentagon officials are scheduled to meet February 20 to review the impact of this new laser system.Reports indicated that the airspace closure was FAA's decision and the aviation administration went ahead even without telling the White House first. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy posted to social media crediting the FAA and Defense Department with acting “swiftly to address a cartel drone incursion.” “The threat has been neutralized, and there is no danger to commercial travel in the region,” he wrote on X.",US officials anonymously said Mexican cartel drones breached the airspace and were disabled by the Pentagon.

— Insider Paper (@TheInsiderPaper) February 11, 2026









Pam Bondi lashed out at Democratic lawmakers in a fiery House Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday, calling one senior member a “washed up, loser lawyer” as tempers flared over the release of files linked to pedophile Jeffrey Epstein The Attorney General appeared before the panel after the Justice Department (DOJ) published millions of pages tied to the prosecution of the late sex offender. Bondi clashed repeatedly with Ranking Member Jamie Raskin and other Democrats. Several of Epstein’s victims were also present in the hearing room.Democrats accused Bondi of failing to protect victims and of releasing documents that revealed some of their identities, while hiding the names of powerful people linked to Epstein. Raskin questioned her about whether any of Epstein’s alleged associates would face charges. He also asked Chairman Jim Jordan to give more speaking time to retiring Congressman Jerry Nadler after Bondi did not clearly answer the question.“You can let her filibuster all day long, but not on our watch — not on our time, no way,” Raskin said. “And I told you about that, attorney general, before you started.”“You don’t tell me anything,” Bondi shot back, before calling him a “washed up, loser lawyer — not even a lawyer.”She then turned on Nadler, accusing Democrats of pursuing partisan attacks against US President Donald Trump . “You said the president conspired, sought foreign interference in the 2016 election. Robert Mueller found no evidence, none, of foreign interference in 2016. Have you apologized to President Trump?“You all should be apologizing. You sit here and you attack the president, and I am not going to have it. I’m not going to put up with it,” she continued.Bondi also criticised Democrats for their past ""silence"" on Epstein. “None of them asked Merrick Garland, over the last four years, one word about Jeffrey Epstein. How ironic is that? You know why? Because Donald Trump.”Democrats and Republican Congressman Thomas Massie questioned whether the Justice Department was protecting powerful people linked to the case. In response, Bondi said some Democrats had ties to Epstein for years before his 2019 arrest, even after he pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting a minor.US Virgin Islands Delegate Stacey Plaskett had exchanged texts with Epstein during a 2019 hearing involving Michael Cohen. Her office later said she received messages from various members of the public, “including from Epstein”.","Attorney General Pam Bondi appeared before a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday.
