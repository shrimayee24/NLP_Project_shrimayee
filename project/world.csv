Survivors' reluctance stalls 35 SIT cases based on Hema panel report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/survivors-reluctance-stalls-35-sit-cases-based-on-hema-panel-report/articleshow/116118767.cms,"Actor Mala Parvathy has urged SC to quash the SIT probe, arguing that it is harassing innocent individuals

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Law enforcement officials here are now finding themselves in a catch-22 situation as they grapple with 35-odd FIRs stemming from findings of the Hema Committee report on sexual abuse and gender inequality in the Malayalam film industry, with survivors expressing reluctance in pursuing legal action.According to sources, the FIRs were filed by a special investigation team set up to address allegations of molestation, attempted rape and rape. However, many of the incidents date back to early 2000s. The passage of time left little circumstantial evidence, limiting the investigation to the survivors' statements, which are now insufficient for further legal proceedings.Most survivors have also expressed disinterest in taking the matter forward. This lack of cooperation has left police unsure of how to advance the cases.While the survivors refrained from naming their alleged assailants, police believe they could identify culprits based on hints provided in the statements made before the committee. As a result, the FIRs have been kept under wraps. This secrecy is intended to protect the identities of the survivors (and also the high-profile culprits) while the investigation is going on.Amid this turmoil, actor Mala Parvathy, who testified before the committee, has sought the Supreme Court intervention to quash the SIT's probe, arguing that the investigation is harassing innocent individuals. The outcome of Parvathy's legal challenge could have significant implications for both the investigation and the broader discourse surrounding accountability in the industry.Meanwhile, G Poonguzhali, AIG (coastal security), is now the nodal officer and immediate contact person for survivors of cases being probed to seek cover from threats and intimidation related to Hema panel report.","Police grapple with 35-odd FIRs stemming from findings of the Hema Committee report on sexual abuse and gender inequality in the Malayalam film industry.

He had been on his way to carry out another alleged murder when his plan was thwarted by a tip-off from a business partner with whom he had conspired.The police had been monitoring Chavda’s activities and secured his remand until December 10, aiming to delve deeper into his occult practices and investigate possible links to human sacrifices.After hours of intense interrogation, he began to feel unwell and was rushed to the civil hospital, where doctors declared him dead on arrival.His confession before his death however, sent shockwaves through the investigation.According to a report by news agency PTI, Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) Shivam Verma confirmed that Chavda had admitted to murdering 12 individuals using a toxic substance – sodium nitrite, a chemical commonly used in dry cleaningChavda's confession revealed a series of brutal killings spanning several years and locations. He disclosed that his victims, including a man in Ahmedabad, six people in Surendranagar (three of whom were from the same family), three in Rajkot, and one each in Wankaner and Anjar, had all succumbed to heart attacks induced by the poisoning. Chavda further admitted to the 2021 murder of a man whose death had initially appeared accidental, only for later investigation to reveal the true cause of poisoning.Among the victims were his own family members, including his grandmother, mother, and uncle, who Chavda claimed to have killed in previous years using the same method.According to police, Chavda had obtained sodium nitrite from a laboratory in his hometown of Surendranagar, using it in occult rituals to enhance his powers and solve his victims' problems—often under the guise of offering them wealth or good fortune.The sinister details of Chavda's operations were unearthed during his arrest, as the police discovered ritualistic items and white powder in his vehicle, all evidence of his dark practices. Authorities suspect that the chemical, when dissolved in water and consumed, caused the victims to suffer fatal heart attacks within 15 to 20 minutes of ingestion.Chavda's ashram in Wadhwan, Surendranagar, was a hub for his occult activities, where he would perform black magic and exploit vulnerable people.","Navalsinh Chavda, a self-proclaimed ""bhuvaji"" with mystical powers, was arrested in the early hours of December 3 by the Sarkhej police.

As per their preliminary probe the toy-like balloon did not carry any device or equipment typically associated with espionage.

RAIPUR: In a disturbing sign that Maoist reprisal is getting more savage, insurgents murdered a second woman in a span of two days in Chhatisgarh's Bijapur on Sunday, accusing her of acting as a police informant.Yalam Sukra , 40, was from Loded village in Madded, less than 50km from Timapur where a woman, 45, was murdered Saturday. Both were strangled in front of their families. On Dec 7, Sukra was kidnapped along with her husband Ramaiya Yalam.Maoists blamed Sukra of tipping off security forces in Chhattisgarh and Telangana.The couple was beaten mercilessly after which the woman was strangled and her body was dumped on the outskirts of Loded. Battered and bloodied, Ramaiya was left next to the body. He somehow staggered into the village, wailing for help.A Maoist leaflet found close to Sukra's body said, ""Sukra was in touch with police since 2017 and informed them about movement of cadres. Between 2017 and 2024, she was warned four times not to work as a police informer, but she ran to police and tipped them and Telangana Greyhounds about our movement recently, which ended up killing seven Naxals.

AHMEDABAD: Delays, detentions and the constant threat of deportation have turned the American dream into a cruel nightmare for thousands of undocumented Indians in the US . They are facing the predicament mainly due to a system that leaves them waiting for years to get Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) clearance, lack of which can hamper their asylum process .Some face hearings as far off as 2027, while others, detained at the borders, are stuck in detention camps, say sources. Stranded in a legal no-man's land, they face the spectre of deportation if caught for staying illegally in the US.A staggering 41,000 Indians applied for asylum in the US in 2023, but many will have to wait for years for a hearing before ICE, the US federal agency responsible for enforcing immigration laws and investigating if the individual poses a threat to national security or public safety.According to legal document of an American agency, a man from Gujarat granted ""alien status"" in Atlanta was granted a hearing date in March 2027. He had applied for the hearing in Jan this year.A statement by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) about the man reads, ""You are not a citizen or national of the United States. You are a native of India and a citizen of India."" Official documents state that if he gets apprehended for staying illegally before his hearing is held, he risks deportation to India.In another case, a couple from Gujarat's Mehsana district was detained with their child after crossing the US-Canada border illegally in June. They were put in a detention camp and their case is pending with ICE. When the couple approached the ICE office last week, they were not allowed to enter. They recently got to know from a US agency officer that their hearing has been scheduled for Aug 2026.Meanwhile, human smuggling networks are advising clients, especially from Gujarat, to avoid citing political persecution as a reason for asylum. A source in the human smuggling network said, ""US officials will strictly scrutinise people who seek asylum citing political harassment. They are more likely to face deportation, too."" Videos obtained by TOI show Gujaratis illegally entering the US and falsely claiming to be workers of opposition parties, when caught.This issue was recently debated in Rajya Sabha and saw government accusing asylum seekers of ""maligning the country for personal gain"".","A staggering 41,000 Indians applied for asylum in the US in 2023.

HYDERABAD: Revathi and Mogadampalli Bhaskar's son Sritej, 9, became a fan of Telugu actor Allu Arjun after watching 'Pushpa: The Rise' three years ago, so much so that neighbours nicknamed him 'Pushpa'.As Sritej battled for life in a Hyderabad hospital on Thursday and his mother's body lay in a mortuary, an inconsolable Bhaskar wondered if 32-year-old Revathi lost her life by putting family above self, as always.She died in the stampede at a city theatre the previous night during the premiere of the sequel to the 2021 'Pushpa' film.""She gave me life, and now she's gone,"" the 40-year-old said. Revathi donated part of her liver in 2023 when he needed a transplant. Her last moments, too, were about making the children happy, he recalled.Sritej and his younger sister Sanvi had been pestering their parents to take them for a show of 'Pushpa 2: The Rule'. Wednesday was supposed to be a special movie night for them, with Arjun being in attendance at the premiere in Sandhya Theatre. Revathi was with Sritej when the stampede broke out, trapping both in a melee of frantic feet. Bhaskar had moved away with Sanvi earlier because the girl started crying amid jostling by fans desperate for a glimpse of the film star.""I decided to drop Sanvi at my in-laws' home in the lane next to the theatre. By the time I returned, my wife and son weren't where I left them. When I called, Revathi said they were inside the theatre... That was the last I heard her voice,"" Bhasker said, breaking down.The bereaved husband believes Revathi was fatally injured in trying to protect their son as the unruly crowd scrambled to escape a police baton charge.Even as he waited outside Gandhi Hospital mortuary, Bhaskar worried about his son who is in a hospital room a few kilometres away, having suffered ""severe hypoxia and potential lung injury"". ""I remember someone showing me a video where Sritej was being carried in a stranger's arms, then being taken in a patrol car that stopped at Chikkadpally police station. He was motionless as they drove him to KIMS Hospital,"" said the anxious father.""I didn't get any updates about Revathi until 2.30am Thursday. That's when some cops broke the news to me, and my world crashed.""Bhaskar has since being trying to convince himself to ""stay strong"" for Sanvi. The little girl, a family member said, was still in a state of disbelief about losing the person she was closest to - her mother.","Revathi and Mogadampalli Bhaskar's son Sritej, 9, became a fan of Telugu actor Allu Arjun after watching 'Pushpa: The Rise' three years ago.

Who Is Bashar al-Assad? The Syrian President who fled Damascus as rebels advanced,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/who-is-bashar-al-assad-the-syrian-president-who-fled-damascus-as-rebels-advanced/articleshow/116094746.cms,"Who is Bashar al-Assad?

Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has presided over a brutal crackdown on a pro-democracy uprising that evolved into one of the deadliest conflicts of the century.

Having suppressed widespread protests calling for his removal and crushed an armed rebellion, Assad had, until recently, regained control of much of Syria in the civil war that began in 2011.

Known for his quiet demeanor, Assad has proven to be a skilled political survivor, adept at forging alliances with Russia and Iran while portraying himself as Syria's only viable leader against the Islamist threat. However, since November 27, an Islamist-led rebel offensive has seized several key cities, including Aleppo and Hama, for the first time since 2011, leaving Assad’s hold on power in jeopardy.

He has long framed himself as a protector of Syria's minorities and a barrier against extremism, emphasizing his role as a stabilizing force in the war-torn nation.

Over the years, Assad has claimed sweeping victories in elections held exclusively in government-controlled areas, elections Western nations have criticized as neither free nor fair.

Typically dressed in sharp business suits rather than military attire, Assad projects a calm, almost reserved image in official appearances, interviews, and even on the frontlines.

Assad’s path to leadership was unexpected. Initially pursuing a career in ophthalmology, his life took a dramatic turn in 1994 when his older brother, Bassel, who was groomed for the presidency, died in a car accident.

Bashar left his studies in London—where he had met his wife, Asma, a British-Syrian Sunni Muslim and former JP Morgan employee—and returned to Syria. There, he undertook military training and received political guidance from his father.

Upon his father’s death, Bashar assumed the presidency through an uncontested referendum and secured a second term in 2007.

Sworn in at 34, Assad was initially seen as a potential reformer, offering hope to Syrians yearning for freedom and economic modernization. Early in his presidency, he was occasionally seen driving his own car or dining publicly with his wife, Asma

AMMAN/BEIRUT/CAIRO: Syria rebel fighters raced into Damascus unopposed on Sunday, overthrowing President Bashar al-Assad .

Steps into spotlight

'Assad Defeated': Rebels Declare 'Syria Is Free' In Damascus; Syrian PM Addresses Nation

'Smart thing to do'



Abu Mohammed al-Jolani is the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham ( HTS ), who stepped into the spotlight after his Islamist alliance led a decisive offensive that rebels claim has toppled President Bashar al-Assad , ending five decades of Baath Party rule in Syria.Jolani, whose real name is Ahmed al-Sharaa, has a controversial past. His group, rooted in Syria’s branch of Al-Qaeda, has been accused of extremist activities. However, he has recently adopted a more moderate image while leading the fight to oust Assad.On Sunday, as rebels entered Damascus, Jolani ordered fighters to stay away from public institutions to maintain order.Earlier this week, he had stated the primary goal of the campaign: “to overthrow Assad.” Thirteen years after Assad’s violent crackdown on pro-democracy protests sparked Syria’s civil war, the rebels announced that Assad had fled the country, declaring Damascus free of the ""tyrant.""Once known for operating from the shadows, Jolani has now taken a public role. During the offensive, he appeared in Aleppo, Syria’s second-largest city, after it was captured by rebels for the first time in the war.He has stopped wearing the traditional turban often linked to jihadists and now opted for military fatigues and a khaki shirt, presenting himself as more practical and adaptable.During a visit to Aleppo’s citadel last Wednesday, Jolani was seen waving to crowds, a stark contrast to his earlier reclusive persona. He also began signing statements under his real name, a shift interpreted by some as an attempt to align himself with his roots and distance himself from his militant past.Born in 1982 to a well-off family in Damascus’ Mazzeh district, Jolani’s path to jihadism reportedly began after the September 11, 2001 attacks. According to the Middle East Eye, he was inspired by the attackers and began attending secret sermons in Damascus. He later joined Al-Qaeda in Iraq and was detained for five years before returning to Syria in 2011 to found the Al-Nusra Front , Al-Qaeda’s Syrian branch.Jolani broke ties with Al-Qaeda in 2016, a move he claimed was meant to prevent Western retaliation. Despite this, HTS remains classified as a terrorist organization by Western governments.Jolani’s leadership has drawn mixed views. Some see him as pragmatic, while others view him as an opportunist. “In 2014, he was at the height of his radicalism,” said Thomas Pierret, an expert on political Islam. “Since then, he has moderated his rhetoric.”Under his leadership, HTS consolidated power in Idlib province by merging with rival Islamist groups in 2017. The group established a civilian government in the region, often accused of brutal crackdowns on dissent. The UN has classified some of HTS’s actions as war crimes.Despite his past, Jolani has sought to reassure residents of newly “liberated” areas, including Aleppo, which is home to a significant Christian minority. Speaking to residents, he promised no harm would come to them under his administration. He also urged his fighters to maintain security in captured areas.""I think it's primarily just good politics,"" said Aron, a fellow at the Century International think tank. ""The less local and international panic you have and the more Jolani seems like a responsible actor instead of a toxic jihadi extremist, the easier his job will become. Is it totally sincere? Surely not,"" he added. ""But it's the smart thing to say and do right now.""","Abu Mohammed al-Jolani is the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham ( HTS) His Islamist alliance led a decisive offensive that rebels claim has toppled President Bashar al-Assad.

Syrian opposition fighters on Sunday reportedly entered the capital city of Damascus in a rapid offensive, posing a significant challenge to President Bashar Assad 's rule. This marks the first time rebels have reached Damascus' outskirts since 2018.The Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), Syria's strongest insurgent group, along with the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army , launched the offensive on November 27th. They quickly captured Aleppo, Syria's largest city, and Hama, the fourth largest.HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani stated the offensive aims to overthrow Assad's government. ""The aim of the offensive is to overthrow Assad's government,"" al-Golani said. The HTS, despite its origins in al-Qaida, claims to have severed ties with the organization.The alliance between HTS and the Syrian National Army is potentially fragile. The Turkish-backed groups want a buffer zone near Turkey's border, and Turkey, while previously supporting anti-Assad fighters, has recently pushed for reconciliation and denies involvement in the current offensive. The future cooperation of these groups remains uncertain.Simultaneously, other opposition groups have mobilized. Local forces have taken control in Sweida, home to Syria's Druze minority, and Daraa, a Sunni Muslim area and a center of the 2011 uprising. The Syrian Democratic Forces, a US-backed Kurdish-led group, control much of eastern Syria. Assad's government now holds only Damascus, Latakia, and Tartus, three of the 14 provincial capitals.Insurgent commander Hassan Abdul-Ghani stated on Telegram that opposition forces have begun the 'final stage' by surrounding Damascus. Syrian troops also withdrew from Homs, Syria's third-largest city. Losing Homs would sever the connection between Damascus and the coastal region, Assad's stronghold.Assad's allies, Russia and Iran, are preoccupied with other conflicts, and Hezbollah, weakened by the war with Israel, offers limited support.

The fall of Damascus

A mysterious flight

Speculations and theories

A leadership in limbo

Damascus is no longer under the control of Bashar al-Assad , as rebels staged a sudden advance and seized the Syrian capital, marking the end of Assad’s 24-year reign. Early Sunday, two senior army officers reported that Assad boarded a plane from Damascus, heading to an undisclosed location, fueling speculation about his fate.The rebel offensive, which began a week ago with the surprise capture of northern Aleppo, quickly snowballed. Cities fell one after another as Assad’s forces were unable to hold their ground. The takeover of Homs , a strategic central city, severed Damascus from the Alawite-dominated coastal region, where Assad’s Russian allies maintain air and naval bases.Assad has not made a public appearance since the rebel advance began. The Syrian leader’s wife, Asma, and their two children are also unaccounted for.Around the time the rebels reportedly captured Damascus, a Syrian Air plane took off from the city’s airport, according to Flightradar24 , a flight tracking service. Initially heading toward Syria’s coastal region, the aircraft made a sudden U-turn and flew in the opposite direction before vanishing from radar.Two Syrian sources speculated that the plane might have been downed. “It disappeared off the radar, possibly the transponder was switched off, but I believe the bigger probability is that the aircraft was taken down,” said one source, declining to elaborate further.The rebels' swift advance has sparked rumors about Assad’s possible escape. Some believe he might seek asylum in Moscow or Tehran, his key allies. However, conflicting reports have muddied the waters.Syrian state media, as of Saturday, insisted that Assad was still in Damascus. Iranian news agencies also released a photograph purportedly showing Assad meeting a top Iranian official in Damascus. Yet, as rebels closed in, state media fell silent.The sole trackable flight leaving Syria after midnight was a commercial plane heading to the UAE, hours after Homs fell. Whether Assad and his family were on board remains unconfirmed.The sudden collapse of Assad’s government has left Syria’s political future uncertain. While celebrations erupted in rebel-held areas, the fate of Assad, a central figure in Syria’s decade-long civil war, remains shrouded in mystery.For now, all eyes are on the radar screens and international channels for any sign of the ousted president’s whereabouts. As one Syrian official grimly noted, “If he was on that plane, the probability of him being alive is slim.”","Bashar al-Assad has not made a public appearance since the rebel advance began.

Legal experts suggest road not easy for Trump



US President-elect Donald Trump vowed to eliminate birthright citizenship at the start of his potential second term, although it won't be easy for him, experts indicate.During a televised discussion on NBC's "" Meet the Press "", when questioned about his plans regarding birthright citizenship - which grants citizenship to those born in the US - Trump indicated the need for change. ""Absolutely,"" he responded.When queried about navigating around the 14th Amendment , he suggested consulting the public, Fox5 reported.Contrary to Trump's assertion, the US is not unique in offering birthright citizenship. Both the US and Canada, among G7 nations, provide this right, with several other nations offering variations of it.This proposal isn't novel for Trump, who previously suggested it in 2018. He mentioned that whilst intending to address this during his first term, the COVID-19 crisis took priority.The 14th Amendment, established post-Civil War to ensure citizenship for freed slaves, states: ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.""It further includes crucial due process and equal protection clauses: ""No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty or property, without due process of law, nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.""Legal experts, including the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project director, indicate that altering birthright citizenship would require a constitutional amendment, necessitating significant congressional support and state ratification, as per Fox5.Geoffrey Hoffman from the University of Houston Law Center explains that arguments against birthright citizenship based on jurisdiction interpretation are invalid, as all non-diplomatic persons in the US are subject to its laws regardless of immigration status.Any presidential executive order attempting to modify this right would face legal challenges and potentially violate multiple constitutional provisions, including Article 2 and laws regarding denaturalisation.","Legal experts suggest road not easy for Trump to change 14th Amendment.

Austin Tice

’s family renews hope

US President Joe Biden called the sudden collapse of Bashar Assad ’s regime in Syria a “fundamental act of justice” on Sunday, claiming the country was suffering under Assad and his family.However, he cautioned that this was also “a moment of risk and uncertainty” for the Middle East.Biden addressed the nation from the White House just hours after rebel groups completed their takeover of Syria, marking the end of over a decade of violent civil war. The president confirmed that the United States was closely monitoring reports suggesting that Assad, whose whereabouts remain unknown with reports indicating that he has taken refuge in Russia.Biden credited the efforts of the United States and its allies in undermining Assad’s backers, including Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah.“Our approach has shifted the balance of power in the Middle East,” Biden said while emphasising that the allies could no longer support Assad’s grip on power.Biden claimed that the Assad regime was responsible for the deaths, torture, and brutality against numerous Syrian civilians during the past fifty years. He further went to say that the end of the government now presents a significant chance for Syria's population to rebuild.""After 13 years of civil war in Syria and more than half a century of brutal authoritarian rule by Bashar Assad and his father before him, rebel forces have forced Assad to resign his office and flee the country. We're not sure where he is, but there's word that he's in Moscow. At long last, the Assad regime has fallen,"" Biden said.""This regime brutalised, tortured and killed hundreds of thousands of innocent Syrians. The fall of the regime is a fundamental act of justice. It's a moment of historic opportunity for the long-suffering people of Syria to build a better future for their proud country,"" he added.The Syrian opposition group that overthrew Assad, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham , has a controversial history. Designated as a terrorist organisation by the Biden administration for its alleged ties to al-Qaida, the group has since claimed it severed those links.Acknowledging this complex scenario, Biden remarked, “Make no mistake, some of the rebel groups that took down Assad have their own grim record of terrorism and human rights abuses. But as they take on greater responsibility, we will assess not just their words, but their actions.”Biden confirmed that the United States would maintain its troop presence in Syria, primarily in opposition-held areas in the northeast, to prevent a resurgence of the Islamic State. He revealed that US forces conducted “dozens” of precision air strikes on Islamic State camps and operations in Syria on Sunday.“We will remain vigilant,” Biden said. “We believe that our continued presence is essential to ensure the enduring defeat of ISIS.”The United States maintains a military presence in Syria, with about 900 troops focusing on preventing an Islamic State resurgence. Daniel B Shapiro, deputy assistant secretary of defence for the Middle East, clarified that the American military presence was solely aimed at defeating ISIS and was not connected to the broader conflict.The fall of Assad’s regime has reignited calls for the safe return of missing US journalist Austin Tice, who disappeared in 2012 near Damascus. Biden assured the Tice family of his administration’s commitment to finding him.“We believe he’s alive, we think we can get him back but we have no direct evidence to that yet. And Assad should be held accountable,” Biden stated. He added, “We have to identify where he is.”","Biden addressed the nation from the White House just hours after rebel groups completed their takeover of Syria.

Hegseth’s controversies under scrutiny

Republican Senators

weigh in

Challenges ahead for Hegseth

Republican Senator Joni Ernst has voiced significant reservations about President-elect Donald Trump ’s nominee for defence secretary, Pete Hegseth , citing the need for further clarity on critical issues.Speaking at the Reagan National Defense Forum in California on Saturday, Ernst stated she needed more information about Hegseth's views and plans before deciding whether to support his nomination.Senator Ernst is a retired Army National Guard lieutenant colonel and a combat veteran.Accordint to the news agency AP, Ernst said, “As a survivor of sexual assault, I have worked heavily on measures to improve how such cases are handled within the military”.“I’d like to hear more about his stance on this and the role of women in combat”, she added.Hegseth, a former “Fox & Friends” host and infantry combat veteran, faces allegations of excessive drinking and a 2017 sexual assault accusation, which he denies. The allegations have raised questions about his suitability to lead the Pentagon, particularly since he has no prior leadership experience within the department.Responding to these claims, Hegseth stated on Megyn Kelly’s ‘SiriusXM’ show that the assault accusation was a ""really unfortunate situation,"" claiming he settled to avoid potential fallout on his career at Fox News.Despite these controversies, Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance have defended Hegseth, describing him as highly capable. Trump remarked in an interview with NBC’s ‘Meet the Press’ that “Pete is doing well now,” expressing confidence in his confirmation.Ernst is not alone in her cautious approach. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine) are among those yet to be convinced, while Senator Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) has emphasised the importance of a public hearing.According to AP, Fischer noted that such a process would provide transparency, allowing the American public to witness both the questioning and Hegseth’s responses.As per Politico, Ernst also raised concerns about Hegseth’s views on women in combat, referencing his comments that women “straight up” should not serve in such roles. Additionally, Ernst highlighted the importance of financial management within the Department of Defense, which oversees a vast $877 billion budget.Hegseth faces a difficult path to confirmation. He has been meeting with Republican senators, including potential swing voters, in an effort to garner support. However, the FBI’s ongoing investigation into the allegations against him could significantly impact his prospects.Senator Angus King (I-Maine) expressed concerns about the pressure being placed on Republican senators to support Hegseth, cautioning against political interference in the vetting process. “I don’t want someone compromised by actions from the past that could jeopardise their ability to do the job,” King stated.As Ernst and other senators await further clarification, Hegseth is expected to face rigorous questioning during his confirmation hearing, a process Ernst described as “incredibly important for transparency and fairness.”","Republican Senator Joni Ernst has voiced significant reservations about President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for defence secretary, Pete Hegseth.

Photographer Hannah Kobayashi’s disappearance and her subsequent appearance in Mexico have baffled investigators, with recent revelations shedding light on her final hours in Los Angeles.According to the New York Post, she spent nine hours with an unidentified man before vanishing.The pair reportedly met on November 11 near Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) and quickly formed a bond. Walking together through downtown LA, they eventually reached Union Station , where they shared dinner and fell asleep in a waiting area.The man, later tracked down by authorities, claimed he awoke the next morning to find Kobayashi gone, as reported by The Mirror.Law enforcement initially focused on the man, who appeared to be the last person to see Kobayashi before her disappearance.Lieutenant Doug Oldfield of the Los Angeles Police Department’s Missing Persons Unit told the People, “For a while, he was the last person to have seen her when we didn’t know where she was. So we did have to spend a few days on this to ensure that nothing bad happened.”After analysing security footage, police corroborated his account and found no signs of foul play.Detective Omar Franco described the man as a “listener,” explaining that Kobayashi spoke about her life in Maui, her personal struggles, and her missed plans to visit New York.“She just spoke about her life … and he just listened,” People quotes Franco.Police confirmed that Kobayashi left Union Station alone, purchased a bus ticket at 6.10 am (local time) on November 12, and crossed the border into Tijuana by noon.

Speculation intensifies over Jill Biden's perceived support

Netizens react

A rare bipartisan interaction stole the spotlight during the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, as President-elect Donald Trump and outgoing First Lady Jill Biden shared a warm exchange. The moment, captured on camera, has since gone viral, delighting Trump supporters and igniting a wave of speculation online.During Saturday's ceremony, Jill Biden and Donald Trump were seated near each other, separated only by French First Lady Brigitte Macron .As they waited for her to take her seat, cameras caught the two engaged in what appeared to be a friendly conversation.While the contents of their exchange remain unknown, social media users speculated that Jill Biden, despite her husband’s long-standing rivalry with Trump, may have softened towards the President-elect.Rumours about Jill Biden’s stance toward Trump have circulated since President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 race in July. MAGA supporters highlighted moments like President Biden wearing a Trump hat during an event with firefighters last September and Jill Biden sporting a bold red outfit on Election Day as signs of their alleged covert support for Trump.Adding fuel to the fire, Joe Biden appeared uncharacteristically cheerful when acknowledging Trump’s victory after the November election, further feeding online theories that the Bidens may not have fully backed Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate.Jill Biden, meanwhile, was on her final foreign trip as First Lady, joined by her daughter Ashley Biden. Social media exploded with commentary on the viral images of Jill and Trump, with users joking about their apparent camaraderie.One user wrote, “Looks like they’re having a good time.”Another quipped, “They totally voted for him🤣”Netizens also used sarcasm about Jill’s wearing the red dress on Election Day. “… yeah, so that red suit I wore wasn’t an accident…”, wrote one user.“Jill and Ashley Biden look like they’re absolutely in love with President Trump 🤣”, wrote a user.Meanwhile, one commented, “Find someone who looks at you the way Jill Biden looks at Trump.”The Notre Dame reopening marked Trump’s first overseas visit since his November 5 election victory. While in Paris, he met with French President Emmanuel Macron, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and the UK’s Prince William.Elon Musk, his close ally and billionaire entrepreneur, was also accompanying him.","Jill Biden and Donald Trump were seated near each other at Notre Dame reopening.

Firm stance from the United States

Shadow of Jolani’s leadership

In Syria’s war-stricken complex landscape, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani , the leader of Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), has become one of the most controversial figures.Although Jolani has sought to rebrand himself and HTS as pragmatic actors in the opposition against the Assad regime, his past connections to al-Qaeda and the Nusra Front cast a long shadow.Recent developments in Syria have brought renewed attention to Jolani’s role, but it was in 2017 that the United States firmly labelled him a terrorist.In 2017, the US government used the official Twitter handle of its Embassy in Syria to portray its stance on Jolani and HTS. Through a series of tweets, the US clarified that HTS was essentially an extension of al-Qaeda in Syria, despite attempts at rebranding.One tweet read, “The core of HTS is Nusra, a designated terrorist organisation. This designation applies regardless of what name it uses or what groups merge into it.”The Embassy account highlighted that HTS’s formation was not a step toward moderation but rather a calculated move to obscure its extremist roots. Another tweet stated, “HTS is a merger and any group that merges into it becomes part of al-Qaeda’s Syrian network.”These tweets were accompanied by a press release that lambasted HTS’s deceptive practices.The release stated that the group’s core aim was to “hijack the Syrian revolution,” with Jolani at its helm. It described him as the operational controller of HTS, whose approach was “volatility,” a reflection of al-Qaeda’s goals masked under a facade of moderation.The US Embassy in Syria’s communications painted Jolani as a central figure in HTS’s operations and ideology. While HTS sought to portray itself as a protector of Syria’s revolutionary aims, the US accused Jolani and his allies of undermining these goals for their gain.A tweet declared, “We remain committed to bringing leading AQS (al-Qaeda in Syria) figures in HTS to justice.”A poster shared by the Embassy explicitly named Jolani as a terrorist and reiterated his allegiance to al-Qaeda. The tweets stressed that HTS’s leadership, despite its rhetoric, remained loyal to al-Qaeda’s strategies, further delegitimising its claims of reform.The US’s reluctance to designate HTS earlier was tied to its complex alliances. One significant factor was HTS’s absorption of the Nour ed-Dine Zenki Brigade, a group that had previously received US weapons and training.This connection raised questions about the implications of officially recognising HTS as a terrorist entity, given the Zenki Brigade’s troubling history, including documented war crimes.This hesitance reflected broader concerns about acknowledging the US’s role in indirectly empowering extremist factions in Syria. It also underscored how political considerations often influence the designation of groups as terrorist organisations.The 2017 declaration by the US Embassy in Syria remains a defining moment in how the international community perceives Jolani and HTS.While HTS has continued efforts to distance itself from its al-Qaeda roots, the accusations levelled by the US cast a long shadow over its legitimacy.","Abu Mohammed al-Jolani is the leader of Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) In 2017, the United States firmly labelled him a terrorist.

Former President Donald Trump urged a ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war and hinted at a potential US withdrawal from NATO .Trump, following a meeting with French and Ukrainian leaders in Paris, posted on social media Sunday that Ukraine ""would like to make a deal"" to end the war. He called for immediate negotiations, saying, ""There should be an immediate ceasefire and negotiations should begin. Too many lives are being needlessly wasted, too many families destroyed."" Trump stated both sides have suffered hundreds of thousands of casualties. He urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the fighting.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, while describing his Saturday meeting with Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron as ""constructive,"" stressed the need for lasting peace. He posted on Telegram, \""When we talk about an effective peace with Russia, we must talk first of all about effective peace guarantees. Ukrainians want peace more than anyone else. Russia brought war to our land.""The Kremlin expressed openness to negotiations, echoing previous statements. Spokesman Dmitry Peskov pointed to a 2022 decree by Zelenskyy that ruled out talks with Putin. This decree followed Russia's annexation of four Ukrainian regions, a move condemned by Ukraine and the West.Zelenskyy reported 43,000 Ukrainian soldiers killed and 370,000 wounded since February 2022. Both sides have been hesitant to release official casualty figures.Trump's ceasefire call drew rapid responses from Russia and Ukraine. His past calls for a truce contrast with the Biden administration’s approach, which avoided pushing Ukraine for immediate negotiations. Some fear a quick deal could favor Russia.In an NBC News interview aired Sunday, Trump reiterated his stance on NATO, saying continued US involvement depends on allies' financial contributions and fair treatment. When asked if he would pull the US out of NATO, Trump said, ""If they're paying their bills, and if I think they're treating us fairly, the answer is absolutely I'd stay with NATO."" When pressed about withdrawal if conditions weren't met, he responded, ""Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely.""

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan ’s imprisoned ex-prime minister Imran Khan has threatened to launch a nationwide civil disobedience movement, in an apparent bid to keep his public mobilisation campaign intact and to force the country’s powerful authorities to agree to his demands.Less than two weeks after his “final call” protest in Islamabad was violently suppressed, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief has asked his supporters to converge on Dec 13 in the northwestern city of Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, to pay homage to party workers who were killed in the crackdown by security forces in Islamabad.His call for protest in Islamabad had mobilised thousands of supporters, primarily from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a province governed by his party. Imran’s party is believed to have organised the Dec 13 gathering in Peshawar keeping in mind his popularity in the region.Imran has also constituted a five-member team to discuss two key demands with govt: release of undertrial prisoners and a judicial probe into the crackdown on the Nov 26 protest march and the violence on May 9 last year. On both dates, PTI workers and Imran’s supporters held major protests, but faced a backlash from govt and security forces.“If these two demands are not accepted, a civil disobedience movement will begin on Dec 14. Govt will bear full responsibility for the consequences,” the PTI chief’s post in Urdu read.“As part of the movement, we will urge overseas Pakistanis to limit remittances and start a boycott campaign. In the second phase, we will escalate our actions further,” he added.The announcement followed Imran’s recent indictment for his involvement in an attack on military headquarters on May 9 last year, while he was also slapped with charges of terrorism for his role in protests that besieged Islamabad last month.Meanwhile, data submitted before the Islamabad high court revealed that the 72-year old cricketer-turned-politician is currently facing 188 criminal cases and inquiries. According to the data, he has been booked in 99 cases in Punjab, 76 in Islamabad and two in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.",Imran Khan has asked his supporters to converge in Peshawar on Dec 13.

Growing threat from Baloch separatists

Sectarian violence fuels instability

Border tensions and counterterrorism efforts

What lies ahead

Pakistan witnessed a sharp rise in terror attacks in November, with 61 incidents marking a 27% increase from the previous month, according to a report by the Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS). The number of fatalities also surged by 69%, climbing from 100 in October to 169, with 225 others injured.The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a banned group, carried out 12 attacks in November, including three high-impact incidents that resulted in 45 deaths. These figures surpassed the fatalities caused by the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), indicating a shift in the BLA's operational strategy. Experts suggest this escalation requires a reassessment of counterterrorism tactics.The majority of these attacks in Balochistan targeted security forces and civilians. Notable incidents included an assault on the Quetta railway station, an attack on a police van in Mastung, and a strike on a security check-post in Kalat, which collectively accounted for 91% of the province’s fatalities.Sectarian violence added another layer to the country's security challenges, particularly in the Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). Seven incidents, including two terror attacks and five sectarian clashes, claimed 115 lives and left 137 injured. The violence was triggered by an attack on passenger buses on November 21, which spiraled into broader sectarian unrest.KP remained the most affected province, with 41 terrorist attacks leading to 114 deaths and 95 injuries. The TTP, Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group, Lashkar-i-Islam, and other local factions were linked to most of these incidents.The report also highlighted six incidents of border violence along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, resulting in 25 terrorist deaths and 11 injuries. This underscores the ongoing instability in the region and the challenges posed by cross-border insurgents.Security forces conducted 19 counterterrorism operations in November, killing 53 terrorists. Most of these operations were concentrated in KP and Balochistan, the epicenters of recent violence.The PIPS report paints a grim picture of Pakistan's security landscape, with 98 conflict-related incidents causing 338 deaths and 411 injuries in November alone. Experts suggest that the evolving nature of terror threats, including the increasing lethality of BLA operations and persistent sectarian tensions, requires urgent and innovative policy responses.As Pakistan grapples with these challenges, the question remains: can the state adapt quickly enough to address the multifaceted threats destabilizing the country?","Pakistan witnessed a sharp rise in terror attacks in November, with 61 incidents marking a 27% increase from the previous month.
