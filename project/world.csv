Pawar Sr initiates Ajit memorial project

MUMBAI: CM Devendra Fadnavis Sunday said they had no idea about the discussions of a merger of the two NCPs nor about the date of merger.“If discussions on merger had gone to a final stage, Ajitdada would have informed us... He is in our govt and without sharing with us would he have taken a decision? I have no idea on what talks took place between him and Sharad Pawar . As far as we are concerned, we have no idea about the merger,” he said.The CM’s statement came a day after NCP-SP chief Sharad Pawar claimed that Feb 12 had been finalised to announce a merger between the two NCP factions.Speaking to the media, Fadnavis said: “If Ajit Pawar was holding discussions on the merger, would he have done so without taking BJP into confidence? Second, supposing he was holding such discussions, was he doing it to get out of NDA when he was stable in the govt. Some like to create confusion and then use one’s ecosystem to amplify confusion...Youall know that the relationship between Ajitdada and me was such that he shared everything with me. Even a day before his unfortunate death, we both sat together chit chatting for an hour. ..”Rejecting the charge that Sunetra Pawar’s swearing-in ceremony was rushed, Fadanvis pointed out that when PM Indira Gandhi was assassinated, Congress took a decision to nominate Rajiv Gandhi to the PM’s post even before her last rites were performed.A grand memorial for Maharashtra’s late deputy CM Ajit Pawar is being planned in his hometown Baramati, with his uncle Sharad Pawar taking the initiative. The memorial is proposed to be built on the campus of Vidya Pratishthan, where Ajit was cremated on Jan 28.On Sunday, Sharad Pawar, along with his wife, Pratibha, visited the campus and held a brief discussion with some trustees of the pratishthan about the memorial for his late nephew. Kiran Gujar, a member of Vidya Pratishthan, told TOI: “Pawar Saheb was heading to Mumbai. On the way, he and his wife called us to the campus where he discussed the memorial for Ajit dada.

MP Rashid’s party seeks citizenship for ex-militants’ kin from PoK,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mp-rashids-party-seeks-citizenship-for-ex-militants-kin-from-pok/articleshow/127846531.cms,"Engineer Rashid

JAMMU: Jailed Baramulla MP Engineer Rashid’s Awami Itihaad Party (AIP) said Sunday it had submitted an assembly resolution seeking citizenship and legal status for former militants’ wives and children who came from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) under a 2010 rehabilitation policy. The J&K assembly’s budget session begins on Monday.Langate Shiekh Khursheed, AIP MLA and Rashid’s brother, said those who came under the rehabilitation policy continue to remain without citizenship or legal recognition, leading to denial of their basic rights including education, healthcare, employment opportunities and identity documents.The UPA govt at the Centre had announced the rehabilitation policy in 2010 during Omar Abdullah ’s earlier stint as chief minister of the erstwhile J&K state.Omar had then described the rehabilitation of such militants as a “humanitarian issue with nothing sinister or dangerous”.Officials had, however, cited stringent criteria and said only 350 of over 1,200 applications were accepted. Citizenship for such families has been a long-pending demand, with PDP having backed it earlier.Addressing a news conference on Sunday, Khursheed explained the AIP’s resolution.“The resolution urges both the J&K govt and the Centre to grant citizenship or appropriate legal status, issue valid domicile and identity documents, and ensure dignity, security and constitutional safeguards for these individuals,” said Khursheed, the lone MLA of his party.Dwelling on other issues, Khursheed pushed for steps to ensure Mehraj Malik, Doda’s arrested AAP MLA, is allowed to attend the assembly session. Khursheed said he had personally handed over a letter to chief minister Omar last week requesting him to convene an all-party meeting and pass a resolution urging LG Manoj Sinha to ensure Malik’s presence in the House. Malik, AAP’s only MLA in J&K, was held last year under the stringent Public Safety Act (PSA) for allegedly misbehaving with senior officials during a protest.Khursheed said he had submitted another assembly resolution seeking transfer of all power projects in the Union Territory to the J&K govt. “This will help ensure cheaper electricity, strengthen power infrastructure and enhance revenue.”Khursheed lamented that he had submitted several resolutions in the 2025 budget session but none was taken up. These pertained to release of political prisoners, restoration of Article 370 and J&K’s statehood. “I am hopeful my party’s resolutions will be taken up this time,” Khursheed said.",Awami Itihaad Party (AIP) seeks citizenship and legal status for former militants’ wives and children who came from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

MUMBAI: Union commerce minister Piyush Goyal triggered a minor tremor on Sunday after he said Praful Patel had been appointed NCP’s national president. Patel quickly clarified on X that the reports on his appointment were “totally baseless”, and Goyal later said he had been “misled” .In an interview to PTI, Goyal said the NCP, as part of Mahayuti, had performed very well and claimed that the leadership of the NCP was clearly with Ajit Pawar and now with Sunetra Pawar, and that Praful Patel had been appointed as national president.State NCP chief Sunil Tatkare Sunday said NCP’s decision to be with NDA was firm and intact, and those who are in tune with it and with being in NDA led by BJP could take their own decision, referring indirectly to NCP-SP led by Sharad Pawar Tatkare’s statement, which came after he was asked a question about a possible merger, indicated that the door for a merger of the two NCPs may not be completely shut yet, but the rival faction would have to accept Ajit Pawar-led NCP’s line.He, however, said those who started merger talks “even before Ajit’s final rites were performed” should answer why it was done. After Sunetra Pawar’s swearing-in, there was speculation that merger talks would be put in cold storage. NCP-SP MLA Rohit Pawar said there will be no political talks in Pawar family for 13 days, and after that, they would take a stand.",Union commerce minister Piyush Goyal triggered a minor tremor on Sunday after he said Praful Patel had been appointed NCP’s national president.

A wedding ceremony in the family of Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar) president Simranjit Singh Mann has triggered a widespread debate within the Sikh community after a video from the event went viral on social media, drawing objections over the use of religious symbols traditionally now reserved for Sri Guru Granth Sahib.The video shows Govind Singh Sandhu , son of Simranjit Singh Mann’s daughter and a descendant of the Shahzadpur Riyasat family of Sandhu Jatts in present-day Ambala district of Haryana, during his wedding rituals. In the viral video, a(fly whisk) is seen being waved over Govind Singh Sandhu’s head, while another person holds a(umbrella – as mark of royalty), with the sound of drums and pipes at the background. Two turbaned Sikh men are also seen escorting him with spears, in keeping with what was described as a traditional princely custom of the erstwhile Shahzadpur Riyasat.However, the visuals soon sparked criticism from a section of the Sikh community. In the present Sikh tradition, theandare symbols of sovereignty and reverence exclusively associated with the movement and presence of Sri Guru Granth Sahib, the living Sikh Guru. Critics alleged that performing such a “royal” ritual for an individual, even as part of a family tradition, amounted to disrespect towards the Sikh faith and its highest spiritual authority.Sikh users on social media not only questioned the conduct of Govind Singh Sandhu but also sought clarification from his relative, Simranjit Singh Mann, known for raising Sikh religious and political concerns. The issue gained momentum as the video continued to circulate widely, intensifying the debate on the limits between cultural heritage and religious sanctity.Amid the growing criticism, on Sunday, Govind Singh Sandhu himself came forward to issue a public apology. In a detailed social media post, he acknowledged the objections raised regarding the use of theandduring his wedding ceremony and emphasized that the concerns were linked to the authority of Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji and Sikh sentiments.Explaining his position, Govind Singh Sandhu stated that the holding ofand the waving ofhad historically been part of ancient princely wedding ceremonies, followed by his family for generations as descendants of the Shahzadpur princely state. He said the ritual was performed during the(marriage procession led by bridegroom) departure ceremony as a cultural tradition and mark of respect, without any intention to undermine Sikh beliefs.At the same time, Sandhu categorically acknowledged that in the present era, such reverence is reserved solely for Sri Guru Granth Sahib. “The owner of the Chaur, Chhatar and Takht of the Sikhs is only the revered Sri Guru Granth Sahib,” he wrote, adding that it is only due to the Guru’s blessings that Sikhs enjoy happiness and spiritual fulfillment.Govind Singh Sandhu clarified that the brief ritual should not be seen as equating any individual with the eternal greatness of the Gurus. Taking full responsibility, he admitted that waving thein this context was a mistake and apologized to the entire Sikh community with folded hands. He also expressed his intention to seek forgiveness at the feet of the Guru, hoping that the community would pardon what he described as an unintentional error.The incident has once again highlighted the sensitivity surrounding Sikh religious symbols and the ongoing conversation about preserving cultural traditions without crossing boundaries that may hurt religious sentiments.","Video shows Govind Singh Sandhu during his wedding rituals.

JAMMU: The ongoing hunt for three fugitive ultras in the snowbound Chatroo-Dolgam-Dichhar belt was intensified on Sunday — day 15 of Operation Trashi-I.Security forces and terrorists had briefly exchanged bullets in Dolgam area Saturday. One terrorist was believed to have sustained injuries, as drone footage purportedly showed blood trails, officials said. Northern Army Commander Lt Gen Pratik Sharma had visited Kishtwar on Saturday to review the counter-terrorism grid.The latest gunfight was the fourth encounter since initial contact was established in Sonnar forest near Mandral-Singhpora, Chatroo, on Jan 18, in which eight security personnel were injured, one of whom eventually succumbed.On Jan 22, another gunfight broke out with holed-up ultras in Singhpora. Yet another firefight followed on Jan 24, in which a Pakistani Jaish terrorist was shot dead.After an overnight cordon, the searches resumed early Sunday and continued till late in the night.Officials said the ultras, on the run for more than two weeks now, had been continuously changing hideouts. Additional forces were roped in to fortify the cordon, and sniffer dogs were deployed to assist the troops on the ground.The region was put under aerial surveillance using drones and choppers to plug possible escape routes.Security agencies were also trying to trace terrorist sympathisers who may have helped the ultras with food and shelter. After leaving a fortified hideout on Jan 19, the terrorists might have run out of rations and consumables, especially in view of the hostile weather conditions.Mobile internet services (all bandwidths) have remained temporarily suspended within a 6km-radius covering Singhpora, Chingam, and Chatroo since Jan 30 as a security measure.","Security forces and terrorists had briefly exchanged bullets in Dolgam area Saturday.

UNSC Drama As Pakistan Flags Indus Waters Treaty After India Calls Out Terror Nexus Lies, Deception

NEW DELHI: India on Sunday categorically rejected “baseless” allegations made by Pakistan that recent attacks in Balochistan, which killed dozens, had Indian backing.Multiple suicide and gun attacks by “terrorists” on Saturday across the restive southwestern province killed 33 people, including civilians, while security forces responding to the violence killed 92 assailants.In a statement on X, ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, “We categorically reject the baseless allegations made by Pakistan, which are nothing but its usual tactics to deflect attention from its own internal failings.”The MEA added that Pakistan should focus on addressing the long-standing demands of the people in Balochistan, as “suppression and violation of human rights” in the region is well known.“Instead of parroting frivolous claims each time there is a violent incident, it would do better to focus on addressing long-standing demands of its people in the region. Its record of suppression, brutality and violation of human rights is well known,” the statement said.The response came after Pakistan’s military and Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi alleged that the attackers involved in the violence had Indian support.The attacks, described by analysts as the deadliest single day for militants in decades, targeted civilians, a high-security prison, police stations, and paramilitary installations. According to the military, 18 civilians, 15 security personnel, and 92 insurgents were killed. Authorities said at least 133 militants were killed across Balochistan over the past 48 hours, including 92 on Saturday.The outlawed Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for the attacks. Some banks were robbed, a police station was set on fire, and dozens of vehicles were torched. The BLA also released videos showing female fighters taking part in the attacks, apparently as part of propaganda efforts to highlight the role of women among militants.","Multiple suicide and gun attacks by ‘terrorists’ on Saturday across the restive southwestern province killed 33 people, including civilians.

NEW DELHI: Despite the backlash over his remarks on Assam's ""Miyas,"" chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Sunday warned that they would face ""trouble"" as long as he remains in power.He reiterated that the ""Miyas"" should continue to face difficulties in order to leave the poll-bound state.The BJP leader told reporters on the sidelines of a government programme in Goalpara, “If I remain in Assam, they will face troubles. They can’t live in peace here. Only if we create difficulties for them will they leave.”Sarma described such people as “illegal Bangladeshis” and said they should not be allowed to work in the state.Referring to an earlier comment about a “Miya” rickshaw-puller charging Rs 5 in fare and being paid Rs 4, the chief minister asked, “I had, in fact, spoken for their benefit. By law, they cannot work here. Citizens of a country can work in their own land. How can those from Bangladesh work?”The term “Miya” is considered pejorative and is used for Bengali-speaking Muslims in Assam, whom non-Bengali speakers often identify as Bangladeshi immigrants.Sarma added that “if they cannot accept me speaking for their benefit, then I have to work against them.”He claimed that “Bangladeshi Muslims” could constitute 40% of Assam’s population in the next Census. He also accused them of encroaching on satras (Vaishnavite seats of learning), land, and engaging in “love jihad” and “fertiliser jihad.”Opposition parties have condemned Sarma’s remarks as “hate speech” and demanded action.Assam is scheduled to hold assembly elections in March–April for all 126 constituencies. The BJP has been in power in the state since 2016, marking its first term.","Himanta Biswa Sarma said the ""Miyas"" should continue to face difficulties in order to leave the poll-bound state.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday ruled that the right to menstrual hygiene is an integral part of the right to life and the right to privacy under Article 21 of the Constitution.The top court has issued a series of binding directions to states, Union Territories and schools to ensure dignity, health and equality for girls and women.The order was given by the bench of Justices JB Pardiwala and R Mahadevan. Pronouncing its judgment on a plea seeking free sanitary pads and adequate sanitation facilities for schoolgirls, the apex court directed all states and Union Territories to provide biodegradable sanitary napkins free of cost to girl students in all schools.“Before parting with the issue, we want to say that this pronouncement is not just for stakeholders of the legal system. It is also meant for classrooms where girls hesitate to ask for help. It is for teachers who want to help but are not able to due to the lack of resources. Progress is measured by how we protect the vulnerable”, Justice Pardiwala observed before parting with the judgment.It also ordered authorities to ensure separate toilets for female and male students, along with disability-friendly toilets, in every school.The apex body made it clear that the compliance would be mandatory for both government and private institutions. It warned that private schools could face derecognition if they fail to provide separate toilets for girls and boys or do not ensure access to free sanitary pads for students.The bench said that access to menstrual hygiene is not a matter of charity or policy discretion, but a constitutional entitlement flowing from the right to live with dignity and bodily autonomy.The top court further directed that it will hold government accountable if they fail to provide toilets and free sanitary pads to girls.It observed that lack of basic facilities and stigma around menstruation directly affects girls’ health, education and privacy.The judgment follows proceedings initiated in November last year, when the court took cognisance of a disturbing incident at Maharshi Dayanand University in Haryana, where three women sanitation workers were allegedly forced to send photographs of their sanitary pads to prove they were menstruating. The incident had triggered nationwide outrage over “period-shaming”.At that stage, a bench of Justices BV Nagarathna and R Mahadevan had expressed concern over such practices in educational institutions and workplaces, observing that they reflected a deeply troubling mindset.The court had issued notice to the Centre on a petition filed by the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA), which highlighted multiple instances of women and girls being subjected to invasive and degrading checks.In its petition, the SCBA argued that such practices were “in gross violation of their right to life, dignity, privacy and bodily integrity under Article 21”.It also stressed that women workers, particularly in the unorganised sector, are entitled to decent working conditions that respect biological differences and protect them from humiliating treatment during menstruation.During the earlier hearing, the court had observed that if a woman was unable to perform heavy work due to menstruation-related pain, alternative arrangements should be made instead of subjecting her to degrading scrutiny.“If someone is saying that because of this reason heavy work could not be done, it could have been accepted and some other persons could have been deployed,” the bench had said, expressing hope that meaningful guidelines would emerge from the case.The Haryana government had informed the court that an inquiry had been initiated into the university incident and that action had been taken against two persons responsible.","The top court has issued a series of binding directions to states, Union Territories and schools. The order was given by the bench of Justices JB Pardiwala and R Mahadevan. The bench said that access to menstrual hygiene is not a matter of charity or policy discretion.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127796720,width-400,resizemode-4/supreme-court.jpg"

HYDERABAD: Telangana’s former chief minister and BRS president K Chandrasekar Rao, who was questioned for five hours on Sunday by the SIT probing the alleged phone tapping and illegal surveillance case, was reportedly made to read certain provisions of Indian Telegraph Act.“KCR was asked to read the provisions of the Act after he claimed to be ignorant about it, and said he had no knowledge about phone lines of individuals being monitored during his govt,” said a source.Sources said the ex-CM was asked if he knew why telephone lines were intercepted and what rules must be followed for destruction of material related to tapping.The SIT sleuths — led by S M Vijay Kumar, joint commissioner of police (special branch) — also asked KCR why the BRS govt retained T Prabhakar Rao as chief of Special Intelligence Bureau (SIB) even after retirement.Prabhakar Rao was named as prime accused in the case by Hyderabad police in 2024, after Congress assumed office.A large posse of policemen was deployed in and around KCR’s Banjara Hills residence throughout the day. Senior party members, including BRS working president K T Rama Rao and former state minister Harish Rao, were present inside the house during the questioning.While KCR was initially served a notice for questioning on Jan 29, it was pushed to Feb 1 after he sought more time. However, his request to conduct the interrogation at his farmhouse in Erravalli was turned down. The SIT arrived at KCR’s house around 2.45 pm, carrying a large volume of material related to the investigation. The questioning began around 3 pm. Later the SIT issued a statement saying it had concluded KCR’s questioning.

Open Letter From Pakistan Backs India As Baloch Leader Signals Diplomatic Break With Islamabad

New Delhi: Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) on Saturday commenced “Operation Herof 2.0”, a large-scale military offensive characterised by synchronised attacks at dawn. While BLA claimed scores of casualties across the region, the official count stood at 12. The local administration claimed to have neutralised 58 BLA fighters.“Fitna-al-Hindustan carried out attacks at 12 locations across Balochistan. During the clashes with the terrorists, 12 personnel of the security forces and the police were martyred,” the Pak media reported, quoting the administration and adding that the attacks were foiled due to “timely and effective action”. In a post on X, Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti claimed that Pak security forces had killed 70 rebels at various locations across the province during the past two days.Spanning around 12 districts and especially targeting the provincial capital, Quetta, this offensive marks a significant escalation in regional conflict and is being regarded as the most extensive assault since 2024.The attacks involved use of suicide bombers and a significant number of women rebels at Kalat, Gwadar, Mastung, Noshki, Kharan, Turbat and Pasni where bank, govt offices and Frontier ops HQ were targeted.The attacks coincided with Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI) top functionary Hafiz Hamdullah’s declaring that armed groups, not the state, now controlled Balochistan.BLA’s Hakkal media also released a new video footage showing commander Bashir Zeb leading armed separatist units on motorcycles.In a statement, BLA claimed to have brought under its control several areas of Quetta, besides Noshki jail and Pasni coast guard camp, police stations and the military intelligence office. BLA’s Majeed Brigade and Fateh Squad (or Fidayeen soldiers) participated in the operation.“The Baloch nation will defeat the enemy in every city, every street and every neighbourhood,” Jeeyand Baloch, spokesperson for BLA, said.

To be or not to be: Ajit Pawar’s death pushes Sharad Pawar into a Hamlet dilemma,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/to-be-or-not-to-be-ajit-pawars-death-pushes-sharad-pawar-into-a-hamlets-dilemma/articleshow/127824799.cms,"Ajit Pawar Dead In Baramati Plane Crash During Emergency Landing, Maharashtra In Political Shock

Why is Sharad Pawar in a dilemma?

Sunetra in BJP’s trap?

Sharad Pawar’s political successor

Will the NCP’s numbers remain the same?

Claims and counterclaims

NEW DELHI: In Shakespeare’s classic Hamlet, the protagonist is torn by a dilemma over avenging his father’s death by killing his uncle Claudius. A similar Hamletian dilemma appears to have gripped Sharad Pawar over the merger of the two factions of the NCP after his nephew Ajit Pawar ’s death in a plane crash.While talking to reporters on Saturday, the veteran Maharashtra leader said that talks over the merger of both NCP factions were in the final stages. He claimed that even the merger date had been fixed -- February 12.“Now we feel his wish should be fulfilled. Ajit Pawar, Shashikant Shinde and Jayant Patil had initiated talks about the merger of the two factions. Even the merger date had been fixed -- it was scheduled for the 12th (February). Unfortunately, Ajit left us before that,” Sharad Pawar said.However, in a contrasting statement, Sharad Pawar also said that it is now uncertain whether both factions will go ahead with the merger.After Sunetra Pawar took oath as deputy chief minister in the Fadnavis cabinet, it became clear that the NCP - with 41 MLAs - will stay in the Mahayuti government.The decision appeared more evident after Sunetra replied to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s message on X, thanking him for his “trust”.Now, it is for Sharad Pawar to decide whether he will compromise for the merger and agree to enter into an alliance with the BJP or not. However, Sharad Pawar has on numerous occasions said that he would not align with the BJP under any circumstances.Meanwhile, many in the Pawar family are also upset over Sunetra’s decision to take oath as deputy CM just three days after her husband’s death.“When one of them called up, a member of Sunetra Pawar’s family said that she and one of her sons had already left for Mumbai to attend the oath-taking ceremony,” a close associate of the Pawar family told TOI.The sources added, “The deputy chief minister’s post is not a constitutional one and therefore, there was no need to arrange the oath-taking function on the fourth day after Ajit Pawar’s passing. Had the NCP shown the courtesy of waiting for the 12th or 13th day of mourning before making their political move, the other group would not have felt slighted.”The Pawar family now feels that by accepting the proposal without consulting them, Sunetra has walked into a BJP trap, they added.Due to health concerns, Sharad Pawar has taken a step back from active politics. He was even absent from campaigning during the local body polls in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad.In his absence, his daughter and NCP(SP) working president Supriya Sule has been calling the shots. She is also being projected as Sharad Pawar’s political heir. Now, amid merger talks, speculation is rife over who will take over as the leader of a united NCP — Supriya Sule or someone from Ajit Pawar’s faction.After the split in 2023, several leaders such as Praful Patel and Sunil Tatkare rose to prominence in the Ajit Pawar faction. If the merger takes place, the Pawar family could once again gain control over the party, pushing these leaders to the margins.If a merger does take place, there is a possibility that several MLAs from both factions may jump ship due to ideological differences, bringing down the NCP’s strength in the Maharashtra Assembly.According to political analysts, if a united NCP decides to join the opposition, several party MLAs could oppose the move and switch to the Shiv Sena or the BJP.Similarly, if the party decides to stay in alliance with the BJP and Shiv Sena, those aligned with Sharad Pawar’s group in the opposition may resist compromising on Phule–Ambedkar–Shahu ideology.Meanwhile, leaders from both factions have made claims and counterclaims citing the late NCP chief over the possibility of a merger. While NCP leaders said that coming together for the local body polls was a one-time arrangement, several NCP(SP) leaders claimed that merger talks were in the final stages.Senior NCP(SP) leader Jayant Patil on Saturday said that late NCP chief Ajit Pawar was eager to reunite with his uncle Sharad Pawar and had held several meetings to facilitate the merger.“He visited my house on multiple occasions and held talks over dinner. He said he wanted to reunite with his uncle by getting over the past. On January 16, we decided to contest the upcoming Zilla Parishad elections together, and the announcement of the formal merger was to be made on February 12,” Patil said.This came after Ajit Pawar met his uncle Sharad Pawar on January 17 and reportedly held discussions over the merger.However, NCP Maharashtra state president Sunil Tatkare refuted any discussion on the merger, claiming that the January 17 meeting was related to local body elections and an agriculture-related event.This followed both factions contesting the local body polls in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad together.However, the united Nationalist Congress Party suffered a massive setback in both civic bodies. In the 165-member Pune Municipal Corporation, the NCP won 27 seats and NCP(SP) three seats, against the BJP’s tally of 119. In the 102-member Pimpri-Chinchwad civic body, Ajit Pawar’s party won 37 seats while Sharad Pawar’s faction drew a blank, as the BJP secured 84 seats.In 2023, Ajit Pawar, along with a group of senior leaders, parted ways with Sharad Pawar and joined hands with the BJP and Eknath Shinde’s Shiv Sena. He had raised objections over Sharad Pawar continuing to lead the party despite his advanced age.Ajit was sworn in as deputy chief minister under the new alliance. The Election Commission later recognised Ajit Pawar’s faction as the legitimate NCP, retaining the ‘clock’ symbol.",Sharad Pawar says talks over merger of NCP factions are in the final stages. But he says it is now uncertain whether both factions will go ahead with the merger. Many in the Pawar family are also upset over Sunetra Pawar’s decision to take oath as deputy CM just three days after her husband's death.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127824811,imgsize-480056,width-400,resizemode-4/sharad-pawar.jpg"

PANAJI: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convener Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday said the citizens of Goa want an ""honest and people-centric politics"" in the state, and added that his party will work towards fulfilling their hopes and aspirations.Kejriwal on Saturday held a meeting with the party's local unit to discuss ways to strengthen the party base in the coastal state.The former Delhi chief minister arrived in Goa on Friday on his three-day-long visit.In a post on X handle, Kejriwal wrote, ""Had a lunch meeting today with the Aam Aadmi Party Goa State Committee and held detailed discussions on strengthening the organisation in the state."" ""The people of Goa want an honest alternative and people centric politics. Together with the people, we will work to fulfil Goa's hopes and aspirations,"" he added.During the meeting, Kejriwal listened to suggestions from party leaders, who raised concern over large-scale land conversions, destruction of khazan lands and damage to lakes and rivers.These leaders alleged that unchecked development supported by the ruling BJP was harming Goa's ecology and affecting local livelihoods.Addressing the gathering along with AAP state unit chief Valmiki Naik and Goa in-charge Atishi, Kejriwal urged party functionaries to build a strong grassroots network that genuinely represents the people.""Our strength has always been our connection with people. Strengthen the organisation at the grassroots and become the voice of Goa. Listen to people's problems, help them raise issues, and ensure those issues are taken to their logical conclusion. Helping people and getting their work done is the real purpose of politics,"" Kejriwal said.Naik said Goa was facing ""unprecedented assault"" on its land, khazans, rivers and lakes, and asserted AAP's responsibility was to stand with the people and raise these issues fearlessly.""We should further strengthen our organisation and ensure we help people protect their land and fight for their rights,"" he said.Atishi said AAP's politics was rooted in service, honesty and accountability, and stressed local leaders must engage more deeply with communities to understand and resolve their concerns.In the 40-member Goa assembly, the AAP currently has two MLAs.Earlier this month, the AAP faced a major setback after a group of senior leaders, including its ex-state unit president Amit Palekar, acting chief Shrikrishna Parab and three other office-bearers, resigned from the primary membership of the party.Palekar was removed from the post of Goa AAP president late last month after the party faced humiliating defeat in the ZP (district councils) polls, winning just one of the 42 seats it contested in the December 20 elections.","Kejriwal on Saturday held a meeting with the party's local unit to discuss ways to strengthen the party base in the coastal state.

One of the federal agents identified in the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis was described by his ex-wife as a long-time gun enthusiast, according to records obtained by ProPublica. Jesus Ochoa , a 43-year-old Border Patrol agent, was named alongside Customs and Border Protection officer Raymundo Gutierrez as the two federal officers who fatally shot Pretti on January 24 during a confrontation. The shooting occurred in Minneapolis as part of a bigger immigration enforcement effort by federal authorities under the Trump administration.Ochoa joined the US Customs and Border Protection’s Border Patrol in 2018 after earning a criminal justice degree from the University of Texas-Pan American, his ex-wife Angelica Ochoa told ProPublica.She said the couple divorced in 2021.By the time they separated, Angelica said, Ochoa had become deeply interested in firearms. She said that he owned about 25 rifles, pistols and shotguns, and that he was passionate about guns.Both Ochoa and Gutierrez are from South Texas. Gutierrez (35) joined CBP in 2014 and works in the agency’s Office of Field Operations, taking part in high-risk missions similar to those conducted by police special units.The shooting of Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old United States citizen and intensive care nurse, drew national attention and scrutiny. Pretti was killed after an encounter with federal agents during an immigration sweep in the city. Bystander videos show that Pretti was shot multiple times after he was wrestled and pinned down by multiple agents. Pretti had a licensed firearm but did not brandish his gun in any way; he was holding his phone in one hand and was trying to help a woman before federal agents took him down.Department of Homeland Security claims that the two officers fired their weapons following basic protocol and that Pretti could be a potential threat. Body-worn camera footage has not yet been released, and the agents have been placed on administrative leave.US President Donald Trump said the incident was unfortunate and said the FBI is investigating each and every bit of the case. However, the MAGA chief had called 37-year-old Renee Good a ""domestic terrorist"" earlier in January when she, too, was shot by an ICE agent in Minneapolis.","Jesus Ochoa, a 43-year-old Border Patrol agent, was named alongside Customs and Border Protection officer Raymundo Gutierrez as the two federal officers who fatally shot Alex Pretti.

Police in Canada have charged a 20-year-old man accused of carrying out dozens of vehicle break-ins across Mississauga, Canada as investigators continue searching for other suspects believed to be involved.Peel Regional Police said Basil Ass’ad has no fixed address and was arrested on January 26 following an investigation into a wave of vehicle break-and-enters reported since December 2025. The incidents occurred in several neighbourhoods, including Kimbermount Avenue, Aquitaine Avenue and Regents Terrace.According to police, officers received numerous complaints from residents reporting that their vehicles had been broken into.Items allegedly stolen included cash, jewellery and credit cards that had been left inside parked cars. Police said surveillance footage collected during the investigation helped identify Ass’ad as a suspect.He has been charged with 48 counts of mischief over $5,000, two counts of theft over $5,000, five counts of theft under $5,000, possession of stolen property and fraud under $5,000. Police allege the fraud charge relates to an attempt to make a purchase using one of the stolen credit cards.Authorities have not confirmed the total value of the losses, but the charges suggest that the alleged damage and theft could exceed $250,000, based on the legal thresholds attached to the offences.None of the allegations have been tested in court. Police said Ass’ad was held for a bail hearing at the Ontario Court of Justice in Brampton.Investigators believe Ass’ad did not act alone. Peel Regional Police said they are continuing to search for an unspecified number of additional suspects who are believed to have assisted with the break-ins.Anyone with information related to the case is urged to contact police or provide tips anonymously through Peel Crime Stoppers.","Basil Ass’ad has no fixed address and was arrested on January 26 following an investigation into a wave of vehicle break-and-enters reported since December 2025.

Two federal immigration agents who fatally shot Alex Pretti during a tense encounter in Minneapolis, Minnesota, have been identified as Border Patrol agent Jesus Ochoa (43) and Customs and Border Protection officer Raymundo Gutierrez (35).37-year-old Pretti was a US citizen and an intensive care nurse who was shot and killed by federal immigration officers on January 24 amid immigration enforcement operations in the city ordered by the Trump administration.According to ProPublica, Ochoa and Gutierrez were named in official records obtained after the incident. Ochoa joined the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Border Patrol in 2018. Gutierrez has been with CBP since 2014 and works in the Office of Field Operations, where he is part of a special response team that conducts high‑risk operations similar to police SWAT units.Both agents are reported to be from South Texas.The report also notes that a Homeland Security Department (DHS) spokesperson declined to answer questions about Ochoa and Gutierrez, and that the FBI also did not comment when asked. Efforts to reach the two agents directly were unsuccessful, according to the news outlet.The identification comes amid ongoing investigations into the Pretti shooting, which has already drawn national scrutiny.US Justice Department (DOJ) officials have opened a civil rights probe into the case, which is being reviewed by the FBI and the Civil Rights Division.Video evidence and news reports indicate that Pretti was filming federal agents with his phone and trying to help a bystander before the confrontation that led to his death. Officials initially said Pretti was armed and posed a threat, but bystander footage reviewed by multiple news agencies showed that he was holding only a cellphone in the moments before he was tackled by multiple men, overpowered and shot.His death came after another fatal shooting of Renee Good earlier in January in Minneapolis, when she was shot multiple times by an ICE agent named Jonathan Ross, reportedly in self-defence. DHS alleged that Good was trying to run over Ross. Good was a mother and a US citizen.The shootings have sparked protests across most Blue states and raised questions about aggressive federal immigration enforcement tactics during the broader operation in Minneapolis. MAGA leaders, including White House aide Stephen Miller and vice president JD Vance have defended the federal agents in all cases. Meanwhile, Democratic leaders have urged ICE to leave to avoid more violence.Trump has justified his decision to send troops to states like Minnesota by claiming that there is rampant criminal activity and massive fraud occurring in certain regions.","Border Patrol agent Jesus Ochoa (43) and Customs and Border Protection officer Raymundo Gutierrez (35) have been identified as the federal agents who fatally shot Alex Pretti.

Read Apple CEO Tim Cook’s memo to employees

Team,

I’m heartbroken by the events in Minneapolis, and my prayers and deepest sympathies are with the families, with the communities, and with everyone that’s been affected.

This is a time for deescalation. I believe America is strongest when we live up to our highest ideals, when we treat everyone with dignity and respect no matter who they are or where they’re from, and when we embrace our shared humanity.

This is something Apple has always advocated for. I had a good conversation with the president this week where I shared my views, and I appreciate his openness to engaging on issues that matter to us all.

I know this is very emotional and challenging for so many. I am proud of how deeply our teams care about the world beyond our walls. That empathy is one of Apple’s greatest strengths and it is something I believe we all cherish.

Thank you for all that you do.

Apple CEO Tim Cook has broken his silence on the Minneapolis shootings, telling employees he's ""heartbroken"" that left two people dead at the hands of federal immigration agents, telling employees he's ""heartbroken"" and believes America must live up to its highest ideals. In an internal memo sent Tuesday, as obtained by Bloomberg, Cook revealed he discussed the situation with US President Trump earlier this week.The memo comes as Cook faces mounting criticism for his proximity to the Trump administration.

BENGALURU: Political tempers flared on Sunday over alleged suicide of Confident Group chairman C J Roy during Income Tax raid at his Bengaluru office on January 30, with the Karnataka opposition alleging serious internal lapses in the operation and Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan seeking a judicial probe into the incident.Vijayan has written to union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, terming Roy’s death “a blot on the tax administration of the country” and flagging what he described as grave procedural failures during the search conducted on January 30. He urged the Centre to order a judicial inquiry through a Commission of Inquiry headed by a former constitutional court judge.The Kerala CM cited allegations by Roy’s brother that the real estate tycoon had been under extreme stress due to repeated Income Tax scrutiny despite cooperating fully.While underscoring the need to curb tax evasion, Vijayan said no enforcement action could justify the loss of a human life in a civilised democracy.He also questioned how Roy could access a loaded firearm and shoot himself when the premises were supposedly under the control of tax officials during the search.Opposition parties in Karnataka echoed similar concerns, accusing the authorities of internal lapses and demanding accountability from both the Income Tax department and the state government.Meanwhile, a Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing Roy’s death has recorded statements from Income Tax officials who were present at his Langford Town office on the day of the incident. Investigators said the officials maintained that they were on the premises only for final scrutiny of documents seized earlier and had not questioned Roy directly.“They required Roy’s signature and those of some staff members. Their role was limited to verification of records,” an officer said, adding that the officials neither seized Roy’s mobile phone or briefcase nor knew he was carrying a licensed pistol.Police, however, said it was too early to conclusively establish whether Roy had any interaction with the officials. “What is clear is that he was not prevented from carrying out routine activities,” an investigator said.The SIT described the probe as being at a preliminary stage, with crime scene reconstruction yet to be carried out. This exercise will be conducted in the presence of complainant T A Joseph, founding director and managing director of Confident Group. Statements of several employees were recorded on Sunday.Summons have been issued to Joseph, Roy’s brother C J Babu and other associates, though questioning was postponed after the family delayed taking custody of the body following the post-mortem.Investigators said there were inconsistencies in Joseph’s complaint, particularly regarding the timeline of events. Staff members told police Roy entered his chamber around 2 pm, while Joseph mentioned 3 pm in his statement. There are also unanswered questions about Roy’s interactions that day, whether he spoke to his mother before the incident, the timing of the door being forced open, and why no one reported hearing a gunshot.Joseph told police he attempted to enter the chamber about 10 minutes after being asked to step out but was stopped by security guards acting on instructions. He returned after another 10 minutes and forced the door open when there was no response.“We are told no one heard the gunshot. The chamber has features that reduce noise, though it is not fully soundproof,” an officer said.Roy, 57, suffered fatal bullet injuries from his licensed firearm at his office near Richmond Circle. He was rushed to a hospital but was declared dead on arrival. Income Tax sources said searches on his premises had been underway for nearly two months prior to the incident.",Confident Group chairman C J Roy shot himself during Income Tax raid at his Bengaluru office on January 30.

"BJP backs students' stir in Jammu over National Law University, Kashmiri leaders fume",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/srinagar/bjp-backs-students-stir-in-jammu-over-national-law-university-kashmiri-leaders-fume/articleshow/127850908.cms,"Jammu: BJP MLA and Leader of Opposition Sunil Sharma, center, along with party workers, sits on a dharna in support of Jammu University students demanding the establishment of a National Law University (NLU), in Jammu.





JAMMU: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders in J&K on Sunday joined students of Jammu University who are protesting for the establishment of a National Law University (NLU) in the Jammu region. The party told students the BJP had not remained silent on the issue and described fight for the NLU for Jammu as a collective struggle.The BJP leaders said that the party would raise the matter in the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly and press the government to accept the demand. The 27-day long Assembly session is starting from today. The BJP leaders said the issue had been discussed earlier on Sunday at a meeting of the party’s legislative group and had also been taken up at the national level in New Delhi.Senior BJP leader and Leader of the Opposition in the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly, Sunil Sharma, along with party legislators Divyani Rana, R.S. Pathania and Shagun Parihar, visited the university campus, where students were chanting slogans demanding an NLU for Jammu.Sharma and the legislators sat with the protesters and said he respected sentiments of the students. He described the demand as a wider regional issue rather than one limited to law students.“This struggle is not just about law students. It concerns every individual of the Jammu region,” he told the students.He said the party would intensify its agitation if the government failed to respond positively. “If the law allows the establishment of more than one National Law University, and the funding is coming from the Government of India, then there should be no obstacle,” he said.With similar demands for a National Law University also coming from the Chenab Valley and Pir Panjal regions of Jammu, Sharma said the NLU could be established in any of Jammu’s ten districts. “I don’t think the government should have any problem with that,” he said, accusing chief minister Omar Abdullah of turning the issue into a regional dispute.Sharma said last year the chief minister announced that the NLU would be set up in Budgam district when there was bye-elections in Budgam and he was fearing that his party candidate would not win the polls.Earlier, Omar rejected the demand to set up a NLU in Jammu instead of Kashmir. He argued that there were no protests from Kashmir when Jammu was allotted both an Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) and an Indian Institute of Management (IIM).The chief minister said that when the Central University issue arose during his earlier tenure when he was CM in erstwhile J&K state, he had urged the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to establish two universities, one in Jammu and one in Kashmir. He insisted that the current controversy over the NLU was politically motivated.In Kashmir, Peoples Conference chairman Sajad Lone has stated that the chief minister should honor his electoral commitment of establishing a NLU in Budgam, while simultaneously questioning what he termed Jammu's ""obsessive"" opposition to developmental initiatives in Kashmir. Lone has stated that the NLU promise was made by the CM during the Budgam Assembly bye-elections. ""The sanctity of the institution of CM demands that he lives up to his promise and set up the NLU in Budgam,"" he said referring to the proposed university's location in Budgam.The dispute has meanwhile deepened regional fault lines. Peoples Conference president and Handwara MLA Sajad Lone sharply criticised Jammu-based groups opposing the NLU in Kashmir, saying the issue had gone beyond development. “Maybe the time has come for an amicable divorce. Jammu has become the proverbial stick to beat Kashmiris with,” Lone said.The demand of establishing the NLU in Jammu instead of Kashmir has gained traction after the National Medical Commission in early January 2026 withdrew the letter of permission to the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Institute of Medical Excellence (SMVDIME). The SMVDIME decision came after protests by the BJP and Hindu groups over the institute’s first batch of admissions, in which 42 of the 50 selected students were from the Kashmir Valley and belonged to the Muslim community.Protesters argued that an institution funded by the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board should admit only students who have faith in Mata Vaishno Devi. While the National Medical Commission stated that the SMVDIME lacked faculty and other facilities, the chief minister had stated the SMVDIME was closed on religious grounds.",BJP leaders in J&K join students of Jammu University who are protesting for the establishment of a National Law University (NLU) in the Jammu region.

From threats to Salman Khan to firing at Rohit Shetty's house: Spotlight on Lawrence Bishnoi gang henchman Shubham Lonkar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/from-threats-to-salman-khan-to-firing-at-rohit-shettys-house-spotlight-on-lawrence-bishnoi-gang-henchman-shubham-lonkar/articleshow/127853025.cms,"Police are investigating if the firing outside filmmaker Rohit Shetty's residence is linked to his upcoming film projects or his recent acquisition of rights to a book on the underworld.





MUMBAI: Police are probing whether the firing outside filmmaker Rohit Shetty ’s Juhu residence was linked to his upcoming film projects, as investigators examine multiple angles, including his professional work and recent association with underworld-themed material.Shetty, who shares close ties with senior police officers and is often seen sharing the dais with them at public events, had recently acquired the rights to former Mumbai police commissioner Rakesh Maria’s book on the underworld. Following the incident, police have enhanced security around his residence, while forensic teams secured the premises for a detailed examination.The firing took place at around 12.45 am on the first floor of Shetty Tower at Hasya Kalakar Mehmood Chowk in Juhu.No injuries were reported. Police said four to five rounds were fired at the building, striking the wall and first-floor portion, after which the assailant fled.Mumbai Police have arrested five persons from Pune in connection with the incident — Swapnil Sakat (23), Siddharth Yenpure (20), Aditya Gayaki (19), Samarth Pomaji (18) and Aman Marote (27). One of the accused is a college student, while the others are unemployed.Police have not yet disclosed who among them fired the shots.Investigators said the accused travelled from Pune on a motorcycle, carried out the firing and abandoned the bike about 2 km from Shetty’s residence. CCTV footage captured the rider near the spot. The motorcycle, which had a Pune registration and was owned by one of the accused, was traced through its registration details and is now in the custody of the Crime Branch and Anti-Extortion Cell.Police said Shetty has three private security guards in the building. “At the time of the firing, the guards were inside the premises. One was briefly away. All rushed out on hearing the gunshots. Shetty immediately informed the police,” a crime branch officer said.Soon after the incident, a social media post surfaced in which Shubham Lonkar, an associate of the Lawrence Bishnoi gang, claimed responsibility for the firing and issued a threat to Shetty and the Bollywood industry. Police said the claim is being verified, noting that Shetty is not known to have received any prior threats.The Pune angle is being closely examined, as the city is believed to have been used by the Bishnoi gang to plan the murder of NCP MLA Baba Siddiqui. Police said no direct link has yet been established between the suspects arrested in the Juhu firing case and those held in the Siddiqui murder, though the angle remains under investigation.Mumbai Police produced all five accused before a criminal court, which granted four days’ police custody. Counsel for the accused told the court that his clients had no links with the Lawrence Bishnoi gang and claimed they had no knowledge of the firing. Police, however, said the arrests were made after analysing CCTV footage and technical evidence.DCP Sambhaji Kadam said the accused hailed from different parts of Pune and were arrested by coordinated teams. “Further details will emerge as the investigation progresses,” he said.","Firing took place on the first floor of Shetty Tower at Hasya Kalakar Mehmood Chowk in Juhu.

US government enters partial shutdown after Congress fails to pass 2026 budget,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-government-enters-partial-shutdown-after-congress-fails-to-pass-2026-budget/articleshow/127814414.cms,"Schumer DARES Trump On ICE After Rare Deal Stripping DHS Funding To Halt Shutdown: ‘No Vote Unless…’

The US government entered a partial shutdown Saturday after Congress failed to approve the 2026 budget by midnight. The shutdown was triggered by Democratic opposition to federal immigration agents killing two protesters in Minneapolis, which halted talks about Department of Homeland Security funding. However, the disruption is expected to be brief as the House plans to approve a Senate-backed deal early next week.The Senate also passed a funding package Friday that covers many federal agencies through September. It also includes a temporary two-week extension for DHS operations while lawmakers work out immigration enforcement details. However, about 75% of federal operations are impacted by the shutdown, affecting various sectors like education, health, housing, and defense.Senate Democratic Minority Whip Dick Durbin criticised the administration's priorities, saying, ""Instead of going after drug smugglers, child predators, and human traffickers, the Trump Administration is wasting valuable resources targeting peaceful protestors in Chicago and Minneapolis."" He added, ""This Administration continues to make Americans less safe.""Federal departments started implementing shutdown procedures overnight.If the shutdown continues beyond a few days, many federal workers could face unpaid leave or work without pay until funding resumes. However, both Republican and Democratic leaders believe the disruption will be short-lived once the House approves the Senate's package.President Trump has endorsed the Senate's agreement and is pushing for quick House action. He aims to avoid a lengthy shutdown like the record-breaking hit last fall that disrupted federal services for over a month. The House, currently out of session until Monday, is expected to vote on the package when they return.While federal agencies began shutdown preparations, the impact on government services, contractors, and federal workers should be minimal if the House passes the funding package as anticipated early next week. This would restore funding within days, limiting the shutdown's practical effects.","The US government entered a partial shutdown Saturday after Congress failed to approve the 2026 budget by midnight.

KDMC mayor race ends as Shiv Sena and BJP file joint nomination,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thane/kdmc-mayor-race-ends-as-shiv-sena-and-bjp-file-joint-nomination/articleshow/127813544.cms,"



KALYAN: Putting an end to days of political speculation and uncertainty, Shiv Sena and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have jointly filed nominations for the Mayor and Deputy Mayor elections of the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC). Along with Shiv Sena and the BJP, the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS)—which had earlier extended its support to Shiv Sena in KDMC—has also emerged as a partner in power with the ruling Mahayuti, indicating a broader political consensus in the civic body.The two Shiv Sena and BJP had contested the KDMC elections together, and their joint move has now brought clarity to the corporation’s top leadership.For the post of Mayor, Shiv Sena has nominated Advocate Harshali Chaudhari, while the BJP has fielded senior corporator Rahul Damle for the post of Deputy Mayor. Friday was the last day for filing nominations, and notably, only one nomination was submitted for each post. This has made the election outcome virtually certain, with the election process scheduled during the special general body meeting on February 3 expected to be a mere formality.Earlier, political circles were rife with speculation after five corporators from the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) extended support to Shiv Sena, and four corporators from Shiv Sena (UBT) were reportedly untraceable but said to be in contact with Shiv Sena leaders.These developments had sparked discussions over whether Shiv Sena's Kalyan Local MP Shrikant Shinde who played important role into getting MNS and four UBT corporators support was attempting to sideline its alliance partner, the BJP, in the mayoral race.However, the joint nomination by Shiv Sena and the BJP has effectively put all such speculation to rest. Shiv Sena’s Kalyan MP Shrikant Shinde, along with local BJP leaders, was present during the filing of nomination forms on Friday.Speaking on the occasion, MP Shrikant Shinde said that welfare schemes launched by the government, especially those aimed at empowering women such as the Ladli Behna initiatives, had received overwhelming public support. As a mark of respect for this support, women candidates have been given leadership roles in KDMC, Thane, and Ulhasnagar. He expressed confidence that Advocate Harshali Chaudhari, as Mayor, along with Deputy Mayor Rahul Damle, would work together to accelerate the city’s development.Chaudhari, a lawyer by profession, is a second-term corporator from Shiv Sena and is known for her developmental work in her ward. Speaking to TOI, she expressed gratitude to the party for placing its trust in her as a woman candidate. She said that after assuming office, her priorities would include strengthening basic civic amenities, promoting women’s empowerment, completing ongoing Smart City projects, and expediting major infrastructure works such as the metro, flyovers, and other developmental initiatives to make Kalyan-Dombivli a truly smart city.Damle, who is senior corporator from BJP and earlier was once deputy Mayor, standing committee chairman and opposition leader in KDMC. He haa filed nomination for second time for deputy Mayor. Talking to TOI, he thanked the top leadership of both BJP and Shiv Sena for reposing their confidence in him. He said that due to the absence of municipal elections over the past five years, several development works had remained pending, and his focus would be on completing those projects and ensuring faster implementation of remaining development plans.","Shiv Sena and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have jointly filed nominations for the Mayor and Deputy Mayor elections of the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation.

Elon Musk Denies Ever Visiting Epstein Island As “Wildest Party” Message Triggers Fresh Scrutiny





Tech billionaire Elon Musk on Monday denied any links with Jeffrey Epstein , saying he never visited the financier’s “creepy island”, travelled on his “Lolita Express” plane, or attended his parties. The clarification came after Musk’s name appeared in the latest batch of documents linked to the Epstein case.Musk issued the clarification on his social media platform X, where he said he had long pushed for the full release of the Epstein files and prosecution of those who abused children. He claimed this stance had made him a target of attacks by what he called “legacy media” and “far-left propagandists”.In his post, Musk said he was prepared to face personal attacks for supporting the release of the files, adding that protecting vulnerable children was more important than his own reputation.“I knew that I would be smeared relentlessly, despite never having attended his parties or been on his “Lolita Express” plane or set foot on his creepy island or done anything wrong at all,” Musk wrote, stressing that he would accept further criticism if it helped bring justice to victims.The clarification followed the US department of justice’s release of the largest set of Epstein-related files so far on Friday. The new tranche includes around three million additional pages of documents, along with thousands of videos and images.The documents provide more details about Epstein’s contacts with several high-profile individuals, including Musk, Bill Gates and US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick. Officials have said the files also contain many unverified tips submitted to law enforcement.",Elon Musk Denies Ever Visiting Epstein Island As “Wildest Party’ Message Triggers Fresh Scrutiny.

DOJ Releases Millions Of Epstein Files As Emails Make Bombshell Claims About Bill Gates | WATCH





US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, who once said that he avoided being in one room with Jeffrey Epstein , had planned a trip to his private island, according to documents that the Justice Department released on Friday.The planned visit in 2012 came years after Lutnick had said he severed ties with Epstein.In December 2012, the records show, Lutnick sent an email to Epstein saying that he had a group of people including his wife and children and another family who were visiting the Caribbean. He asked where Epstein was located and whether they could visit for a meal, New York Times reported.Epstein replied through an assistant to give more information about the location of Little St.James, his private island off the coast of St. Thomas in the US Virgin Islands. They eventually settled on plans for a lunch gathering.Prominent people who were close to Epstein have been scrutinised in recent years for their visits to Little St. James, but Lutnick’s planned visit had not been previously disclosed. Reached by phone on Friday, Lutnick said he could not comment about the island visit because he had not seen the latest Epstein documents.“I spent zero time with him,” Lutnick said. He then hung up.The documents suggest the visit did occur. The gathering was set for Dec. 23, 2012. A day later, an assistant to Epstein forwarded Lutnick a message from Epstein: “Nice seeing you,” it said.In a podcast interview last year, Lutnick claimed that around 2005, he and his wife had been so revolted by Epstein that they decided not to associate with him again.Lutnick said in the interview that Epstein invited them to tour his Upper East Side mansion, next door to Lutnick’s own home. When they noticed a massage table in the middle of a room, Lutnick recalled, Epstein explained that he received “the right kind of massage” every day. Lutnick said that he and his wife quickly left and decided to “never be in a room with that disgusting person ever again.”“So I was never in the room with him socially, for business, or even philanthropy,” Lutnick said in the interview with Pod Force One. “If that guy was there, I wasn’t going, because he’s gross.”Before they connected in December 2012, an assistant to Epstein had reached out to Lutnick. “Jeffrey requested I please pass along some phone numbers to you so the two of you can possibly get together,” the assistant wrote the month before.Lutnick planned the Caribbean excursion along with his wife, Allison. She explained in an email that they would be arriving on a 188-foot yacht called “Excellence.”The documents show that Lutnick and Epstein’s lives continued to overlap in more recent years. In 2017, Epstein contributed to a charity dinner honouring Lutnick. In 2018, they exchanged emails that appear to discuss them joining forces to battle construction plans by The Frick Collection, a museum across the street from both of their homes.","US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick had planned a trip to Jeffrey Epstein's private island, according to documents that the Justice Department released on Friday.

Zohran Mamdani appoints ex-prisoner to lead New York City’s jail system – Who is Stanley Richards?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/zohran-mamdani-appoints-ex-prisoner-to-lead-new-york-citys-jail-system-who-is-stanley-richards/articleshow/127847175.cms,"



New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani has appointed a formerly incarcerated man as the new Commissioner of the city’s Department of Correction.64-year-old Stanley Richards will be the first person who has previously served time in prison to lead the department that runs the city’s jails.Mamdani announced the appointment at a press event earlier this week. He said Richards’ life experience will help guide changes in the city’s corrections system.Richards spent about two and a half years at Rikers Island and another four and a half years in state prison after being convicted of robbery in the late 1980s. He was released from prison in 1991.After his release, Richards began working with the Fortune Society, a nonprofit organisation (NPO) in New York City that helps people returning from jail and prison.He eventually became the president and chief executive officer of the organisation and has spent decades working on reentry programmes and advocacy. He has also been an advocate of prison reforms.In a statement, Richards said his appointment was an opportunity to lead from the top and work for both people in custody and correction officers. He said his own experience behind bars influenced his work and commitment to improving the justice system.The appointment comes as New York City’s jail system faces close attention. Rikers Island has had long-term problems with violence and management, and it has been under federal supervision for years. A federal judge recently hired an outside manager to help with reforms at the jail.Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist, previously supported calls to defund the New York Police Department (NYPD) and criticised the NYPD as “racist” and a “major threat to public safety” in social media posts in 2020. He has since said he will not defund the police and has apologised to officers for past remarks.Meanwhile, several police officers have left the NYPD in recent months and union leaders have reported a rise in resignations and departures, partly linked to low morale.",64-year-old Stanley Richards will be the first person who has previously served time in prison to lead the department that runs the city’s jails.

From protest to prison: Molotov attack during LA anti-ICE protest lands Mexican national 4 years behind bars,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/from-protest-to-prison-molotov-attack-during-la-anti-ice-protest-lands-mexican-national-4-years-behind-bars/articleshow/127847775.cms,"



A US federal court has sentenced a 23-year-old man to four years in prison for throwing a Molotov cocktail at law enforcement officers during protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in the Los Angeles area last year.Emiliano Garduno Galvez, a Mexican national who authorities say is living in the US without legal status, pleaded guilty to possessing an unregistered destructive device and interfering with law enforcement during a civil disorder. The incident took place on June 7 in Paramount, near Los Angeles, amid widespread protests against federal immigration enforcement operations.According to court records, sheriff’s deputies were responding to a large protest outside a Home Depot where US Border Patrol agents had assembled.While many demonstrators were peacefully chanting and carrying signs, authorities said some individuals began throwing rocks and other objects. Prosecutors said Galvez went behind a wall, lit an improvised incendiary device and hurled it toward deputies on the other side.The Molotov cocktail did not strike any officers, but landed in a grassy area close to both deputies and a civilian protester. Federal prosecutors stressed that the device was capable of causing serious injury or death, arguing that its proximity to bystanders highlighted the danger posed by such actions.In a statement, First Assistant US Attorney Bill Essayli said the sentence sends a clear message that violence during protests will not be tolerated. “When protesting crosses the line into violence, the penalties will be severe,” he said, adding that federal authorities would continue to pursue those who endanger public safety.Gavez’s public defenders had sought a lighter sentence, citing his acceptance of responsibility and acknowledgement of the potential harm caused. However, the court opted for a four-year term, noting the seriousness of using an incendiary weapon during a volatile public gathering.The case comes as the US continues to grapple with balancing the right to protest against the need to maintain public order during highly charged demonstrations over immigration policy.","Emiliano Garduno Galvez, a Mexican national who authorities say is living in the US without legal status, pleaded guilty to possessing an unregistered destructive device.

Canada’s fertility rate has hit an all-time low, sparking concern among experts and politicians about the long-term sustainability of the nation’s population.Leslyn Lewis, a Canadian lawyer and politician, said mass immigration should not be treated as a substitute for a society that struggles to support families.“Canada now has one of the lowest fertility rates in the world,” Lewis posted on X.She added: “When fertility stats are below replacement level (about 2.1 children per woman), populations shrink putting the nation’s long term survival at risk.”She warned that governments often rely on immigration to fill gaps left by a declining population, but argued this is not a real solution.Lewis said: “Mass immigration has become the Liberal government’s default response.But it’s a substitute, not a solution. A healthy society doesn’t rely on permanent emergency measures. It creates conditions where people can afford stability, and feel confident welcoming children into their lives.”","Canada’s fertility rate has hit an all-time low, sparking concern among experts and politicians.

Prince Andrew should testify before US Congress panel over Epstein ties: Keir Starmer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/prince-andrew-should-testify-before-us-congress-panel-over-epstein-ties-keir-starmer/articleshow/127852644.cms,"AFP photo.





TOKYO: British PM Keir Starmer said on Saturday that the former Prince Andrew should testify before a US congressional committee, following new revelations about Andrew's links to the late financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.New files related to Epstein published by the US justice department on Friday included emails that showed King Charles's brother maintaining regular contact with Epstein for more than two years after he was found guilty of child sex crimes. The files also include pictures appearing to show Andrew crouching over and touching the waist of an unidentified woman lying on the floor. Her face was blacked out in the redacted images.Separately, the BBC on Sunday quoted a US lawyer as saying a woman had alleged she was sent, while in her 20s, by Epstein to Britain for a sexual encounter with Andrew which took place in 2010 in a royal property on the estate of Windsor Castle.Representatives for Andrew, who has always denied wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the BBC report. Reuters has also sought comment from the US lawyer, Brad Edwards from the US firm Edwards Henderson, who made the claims on behalf of the unidentified woman, who the BBC said was not British.The allegation represented the second claim of a woman being flown from the US to Britain to meet Andrew after Virginia Giuffre, a prominent accuser of Epstein, said she was forced to have sex with him in London.In 2022, Andrew made an undisclosed payment to settle a lawsuit brought in the US by Giuffre who died by suicide in April. Andrew, 65, has always denied Giuffre's account.Starmer, meanwhile, speaking to reporters on the plane to Japan after a four-day visit to China, said the former prince should appear before US lawmakers to explain everything he knows about Epstein to help his victims. In Nov, members of a US congressional committee investigating the Epstein case intensified their calls for Andrew to answer questions. reuters","British PM Keir Starmer said the former Prince Andrew should testify before a US congressional committee.

"Rebuilt titles, fake invoices, and stolen parts: Florida couple arrested in $500k luxury car fraud",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/rebuilt-titles-fake-invoices-and-stolen-parts-florida-couple-arrested-in-500k-luxury-car-fraud/articleshow/127845024.cms,"



A South Florida husband and wife who own a luxury car dealership are facing dozens of criminal charges following an investigation into an alleged vehicle title fraud scheme involving high-end cars valued at more than USD 500,000.Michael Anthony Lucci, 32, and Emily Marie Lucci, 30, owners of Luxury Auto Source in Davie, Florida, were arrested after the Florida Highway Patrol (FHP) determined that multiple vehicles sold through their dealership were titled using fraudulent or altered repair invoices.According to jail records and arrest reports, the couple is charged with 38 offences, including racketeering, organised fraud, perjury, uttering forged instruments, and possession of counterfeit vehicle titles or registrations.The investigation began in January after authorities reviewed documentation submitted for a 2020 Nissan GT-R. Records show Emily Lucci filed paperwork at a Miami-Dade tag agency seeking a rebuilt title, supported by an invoice claiming more than USD 18,000 in repairs.Investigators later determined the legitimate repair costs totalled nearly USD 1,200. The vehicle was subsequently listed for sale for USD 94,500, nearly USD 40,000 more than its prior sale price in 2022.Following that discovery, FHP expanded its investigation to other vehicles listed by the dealership. Authorities identified eight additional luxury vehicles with rebuilt Florida titles that were allegedly obtained using falsified or manipulated invoices.Those vehicles included a 2022 Porsche 911 priced at USD 187,900, a 2017 Bentley listed for USD 63,900, a 2018 BMW M3, a 2020 Toyota Supra, a 2022 Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat, and a 2023 Cadillac Escalade.Investigators said the Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat raised additional concerns, as it reportedly contained multiple VINs and an engine traced to a vehicle stolen out of North Carolina.In arrest documents, an investigator stated that all nine vehicles were considered contraband because their titles were acquired through fraudulent means.Authorities warned that any buyers could face seizure and forfeiture of the vehicles, potentially losing both the cars and the money paid for them.Michael Lucci was taken into custody during the execution of a search warrant at the dealership, while Emily Lucci later surrendered to authorities. Both were released after posting USD 30,000 bond. As of now, no attorney information has been publicly listed for either defendant, and FHP has not issued further comment.","Michael Anthony Lucci and Emily Marie Lucci are owners of Luxury Auto Source in Davie, Florida.
