NEW DELHI: Members of a parliamentary committee on Wednesday debated whether opposition parties, which have refused joining their panel formed to study a bill aimed at ""decriminalisation"" of politics, should be invited to offer their views on the proposed law and if the leader of opposition can be removed from office under its provisions.Law Commission of India chairperson Dinesh Maheshwari was among the key figures who shared their views with the Joint Committee of Parliament scrutinising the Constitution (130th Amendment) Bill and two related bills, which seek removal from office of PM, CMs and ministers if they are under arrest for 30 days and more on serious criminal charges.A BJP MP, sources said, flagged a scenario when the governing party refuses to name the replacement for PM and CMs in case they are removed from office due to their detention and said amendments should be made to plug this loophole to rule out such a possibility that can cripple governance, especially in times of crisis in the country or a state.If such a case arises, then the president of the country or the governor of a state should be legally empowered to use their discretion if a replacement of the arrested head of govt is not forthcoming, he suggested.Congress and most other opposition parties have refused to join the committee, which is headed by BJP's Aparajita Sarangi, as they have slammed the bill as unconstitutional and politically motivated.The committee has only two MPs from the opposition among its members-Supriya Sule of NCP(SP) and AIMIM's Asaduddin Owaisi.When one of them suggested that opposition parties should be invited to offer their views on the bill, several MPs questioned the proposal noting that they had ignored repeated suggestions by Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla to join the panel.Some members also wondered if the leader of opposition can be removed from office under the bill's provisions.Though the two LoPs in Parliament, and LoPs in state assemblies enjoy certain govt protocols, they are not considered part of the executive and are not covered under the current provisions of the bill.Sources said Maheshwari and Hyderabad-based National Academy of Legal Studies and Research's VC Sri Krishna Deva Rao agreed with the idea behind the bill's aim for decriminalisation of politics amid several suggestions made by them and committee's members.","Law Commission of India chairperson Dinesh Maheshwari was among key figures who shared their views with the Joint Committee of Parliament scrutinising the Constitution (130th Amendment) Bill.

'Believed shrine revamp harmed India's image': BJP cites letters by Nehru to accuse him of 'hating' Somnath temple deity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/believed-shrine-revamp-harmed-indias-image-bjp-cites-letters-by-nehru-to-accuse-him-of-hating-somnath-temple-deity/articleshow/126404662.cms,"NEW DELHI/ RAJKOT: Ahead of the launch of year-long ""Somnath Swabhiman Parv"" by PM Narendra Modi on Jan 11, BJP on Wednesday launched a fresh attack on Congress for its govt's opposition to the reconstruction of the revered temple and flagged letters written by Jawaharlal Nehru to accuse him of ""hating"" the deity.BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi said Nehru believed the temple's reconstruction and association of Congress stalwarts like Rajendra Prasad, then President, harmed India's global image and said the opposition party continued to follow a similar distaste for the country's Hindu heritage.At a press conference in Delhi, Trivedi said the first PM addressed his Pakistani counterpart Liaquat Ali Khan as ""my dear nawabzada"" to protest false reports in that country over the temple's construction instead of defending India's civilisational memory.He also wrote to India's ambassador in China to play down its significance apparently to minimise any adverse reaction from Mao Zedong, the Rajya Sabha MP said, alleging that he pursued ""blind appeasement politics by repeatedly emphasising his opposition to then President Rajendra Prasad's association with its inauguration. ""Our opposition to Nehru is not personal but on principles. His letters underline how scary and dangerous his ideas were.We are not tarnishing his image. We are merely unmasking it as Congress continues to follow the same principle,"" BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi said.Modi will offer prayers at the temple and pay tributes at the statue of Sardar Patel outside its precincts. He is also scheduled to attend a roadshow and Shaurya Yatra, dedicated to those who laid down their lives defending the temple from invaders, and address a large public gathering.""The year marks 1,000 years since Mahmud Ghazni's attack on the Somnath temple in 1026 AD, while also completing 75 years of Sardar Patel's historic resolve to rebuild the shrine. To mark this rare convergence, the festival has been planned to honour Somnath's legacy of resilience and valour,"" Gujarat minister Jitu Vaghani said. Highlighting the key attractions of the festival, the Gujarat minister said a mega drone show featuring 3,000 drones - the largest of its kind - will depict the history and grandeur of Somnath in the night sky.Prime Minister Modi's visit on Jan 11, which marks 1,000 years of the temple's destruction by Mahmud Ghazni, and his projection of its revival as a tribute to India's cultural resilience coupled with Nehru's wariness of the revered temple's rebuilding have provided a fresh ballast to BJP's campaign to paint Congress as indifferent if not outrightly hostile to the country's Hindu heritage but being rather sensitive to interests of minorities, especially Muslims.Nehru wrote over 17 letters to question the need for Somnath temple's reconstruction, including to the then president, vice president, cabinet ministers and chief ministers, and asked public broadcasters to minimise its coverage.He said Nehru prioritised ""external appeasement over internal self-confidence"". ""Somnath was plundered by Mahmud Ghazni and Khilji in the past, but in independent India, Pandit Nehru harboured the greatest hatred towards Lord Somnath,"" he alleged.","BJP launches fresh attack on Congress for its opposition to the reconstruction of the revered temple.

Donald Trump Says PM Modi 'Not Happy With Me' Over Higher Russian Oil Tariffs

US President Donald Trump has said Prime Minister Narendra Modi is “not that happy” with him because of the tariffs Washington has imposed on India over its purchases of Russian oil, linking trade pressure directly to New Delhi’s energy ties with Moscow.Speaking at the House GOP Member Retreat, Trump referred to his interactions with the Indian leader while discussing US defence sales and tariffs.He claimed India had raised concerns over delays in receiving US military hardware and said the issue was now being addressed. “India ordered 68 Apaches,” Trump said, adding that India had told him it had been waiting for five years for the helicopters, as per PTI.During his remarks, Trump said he shared a good relationship with Modi but acknowledged the strain caused by tariffs. “He’s not that happy with me because, you know, they’re paying a lot of tariffs now because they’re not doing the oil, but they are — they’ve now reduced it very substantially, as you know, from Russia,” Trump said, according to PTI.Trump has imposed a 50 per cent tariff on India, which includes a 25 per cent levy linked specifically to India’s purchases of Russian oil, PTI reported. He also used the platform to defend his tariff policy more broadly, claiming the US was benefiting financially from the measures.The comments come amid repeated warnings from Trump to New Delhi over its continued oil trade with Russia.Earlier, Trump said the US could raise tariffs further if India does not “help on the Russian oil issue,” directly tying the threat to the Russia–Ukraine war.He has accused India of strengthening Moscow by buying discounted Russian crude and has cited this as the reason for sharply higher duties on Indian goods.Trump has also portrayed the tariff pressure as a tool to influence India’s behaviour, saying New Delhi knew he was unhappy and wanted to keep trade relations on track.At the same time, he has sought to position himself as a potential mediator in the Russia–Ukraine conflict, holding talks with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, though without any concrete breakthrough.India, for its part, has previously rejected Trump’s claim that PM Modi had assured him New Delhi would stop buying Russian oil, clarifying that no such conversation took place.","US President Donald Trump says PM Narendra Modi is 'not that happy' with him.

Gunfight erupts in J&K’s Kathua after sighting of terror suspects,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gunfight-erupts-in-jks-kathua-after-sighting-of-terror-suspects/articleshow/126401969.cms,"Representative image (PTI Photo)

JAMMU: A gun battle broke out between security forces and terrorists in the forests in the upper reaches of Billawar, in J&K’s Kathua district, on Wednesday, where a group of two-three ultras was suspected to be hiding. Around 4pm that evening, locals had reported spotting a terror suspect in Kamad Nallah area.“On being alerted, a joint team of security forces, including SOG Kathua and CRPF personnel, rushed to the area and launched a massive search operation. Holed-up terrorists opened fire at the search party, triggering an encounter. As the firefight erupted, the ultras ran into the forest,” an official said.IGP (Jammu Zone) Bhim Sen Tuti, in an X post, stated that the troops were relentlessly engaging the terrorists despite “darkness, thick vegetation and treacherous terrain”. Officials said the area had been cordoned off. The operation remained in progress till late Wednesday.Earlier this month, a village defence guard (VDG) fired warning shots in the air on Jan 2, upon observing suspicious movement near his house in Dessa village, Doda district, following which security forces launched an anti-terror operation in the area. On Dec 31, 2025, a similar operation was carried out in Dali village in Rajouri district’s Kalakote area based on a VDG’s report about suspicious movement.A string of counter-terror operations has been underway in the upper reaches of Doda, Kishtwar and Ramban districts in Chenab region, and the border areas along Udhampur and Kathua districts, to track and kill ultras on the move. Such operations were also continuing in the two frontier districts of Rajouri and Poonch, and Reasi district, which shares a border with Rajouri-Ramban in Jammu division and Kulgam in south Kashmir.","A gun battle broke out between security forces and terrorists in the forests in the upper reaches of Billawar, in J&K’s Kathua district, on Wednesday.

India Knows Pakistan Will Not Abandon Terrorism, Jaishankar Says Delhi Has Policy To Deal With It

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Wednesday took a dig at the western hypocrisy during India's military response under Operation Sindoor , declaring India does not need the West's free advice. ""Why don't you look at your own region for levels of violence?"" he remarked.Speaking to members of the Indian community in Luxembourg, Jaishankar recalled that several nations offered unsolicited advice to the country during Operation Sindoor, India's military response launched in May 2025 after the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians.""Sometimes you hear people say, like it happened during Operation Sindoor. Now if you ask them, say, ""oh really you're worried, why don't you look at your own region? And ask yourself, what are the levels of violence there.""""How much risks have been taken, how much worry the rest of us have about what you are doing. But that's the nature of the world. People, what they say is not what they do,"" he added.Jaishankar further underlined that India will engage differently with different actors. ""So those who are willing to work with us and be helpful, positive, we have to deal with them in that way,"" he said, adding ""those who do the kind of things which Pakistan does, we have to deal with it in a different way.""Jaishankar also took a jibe on how the western countries often advise others on handling their internal or regional conflicts, suggesting such commentary is frequently detached from ground realities and offered without much thought.""Now, to what extent do the developments in the rest of the world affect it? It's hard to say. People sitting far away will say things, sometimes with application of mind, sometimes not, sometimes with self-interest, sometimes carelessly. That will happen.""""I can tell you, whatever you might say, in this day and age, countries are more, I don't want to say they become more selfish, but they will do things only if it is of direct benefit to them. They'll offer you free advice. If something happens, say, no, please don't do that. It worries us if there is tension,"" he added.US President Donald Trump had repeatedly claimed that Washington mediated the May 2025 India-Pakistan ceasefire, an assertion India has rejected.New Delhi has maintained that the military pause followed a request from Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations to his Indian counterpart, not third-party intervention.Further on the Venezuela crisis , Jaishankar said India's primary concern is the safety of the people following US military operations there.""We are concerned about the developments, but we would really urge all the parties involved to now sit down and come to a position which is in the interest of the well-being and safety of the people of Venezuela, because at the end of the day, that is our concern,"" Jaishankar said.""We would want Venezuela as a country with whom, over many, many years, we’ve had very good relations. So we would like the people to come out well, whatever the direction of events,"" he added.His remarks came after Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured in Caracas and flown out of the country during a joint operation involving intelligence agencies and US law enforcement."," External affairs minister S Jaishankar took a dig at the western hypocrisy during India's military response under Operation Sindoor.

'No Strategic Sense': Ex-NSA John Bolton Slams Trump Over India Tariffs

NEW DELHI: Leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday launched a sharp attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, accusing him of ""surrendering"" under ""pressure"" and contrasted his leadership with that of former prime minister Indira Gandhi Gandhi’s remarks came a day after US President Donald Trump , speaking at the House GOP Member Retreat, claimed that PM Modi had sought an audience with him. “Prime Minister Modi came to see me, ‘Sir, may I see you please’. Yes,” Trump said.Trump also referred to India facing steep tariffs, saying New Delhi was ""paying a lot of tariffs now"" and had ""reduced"" the purchase of Russian oil ""substantially"".Gandhi shared a video message on X with the caption ""Fark samjho sirji"".“I know these BJP–RSS people very well now. Put a little pressure on them, give them a little push and they run away in fear,” Gandhi said. “As soon as Trump signalled from there, they picked up the phone and said, ‘What are you doing Modi ji?’ Narendra surrendered and with ‘yes sir’, Narendra Modi ji followed Trump’s signal.”Drawing a comparison with the 1971 war, Gandhi said India had once stood firm despite US pressure.“You might remember a time when the phone call didn’t come — the Seventh Fleet had come. In the 1971 war, the Seventh Fleet came, weapons came, an aircraft carrier came. Indira Gandhi ji said, ‘I will do what I have to do.’ This is the difference,” he said, referring to the United States Seventh Fleet.Trump has imposed tariffs totalling 50% on Indian exports, including a 25% levy linked to India’s procurement of Russian oil.“I have a very good relationship with him. He’s not that happy with me because they’re paying a lot of tariffs now because they’re not doing the oil — but they are, they’ve now reduced it very substantially,” Trump said.The tariffs, imposed in August, have triggered multiple rounds of trade talks and at least four conversations between the two leaders, but have yet to yield a bilateral trade deal.Separately, Trump also said in his remarks that India had flagged delays in the delivery of Apache helicopters, claiming New Delhi has been waiting for the aircraft for five years.","Gandhi shared a video message on X with the caption ""Fark samjho sirji"" Gandhi’s remarks came a day after US President Donald Trump claimed that PM Modi had sought an audience with him.

"Medical college row: Omar says Jammu’s loss, blames protesters for ‘destroying’ students’ future; BJP & Hindu groups celebrate",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/medical-college-row-omar-says-jammus-loss-blames-protesters-for-destroying-students-future-bjp-hindu-groups-celebrate/articleshow/126401866.cms,"SRINAGAR: BJP and Hindu groups on Wednesday celebrated the National Medical Commission’s decision to withdraw permission to Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Institute of Medical Excellence (SMVDIME) in Reasi, Jammu, to run an MBBS course from 2025-26 academic session, while J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah reacted sharply, accusing them of playing with the future of students.As activists of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Sangharsh Samiti — a conglomerate of Hindu social and religious organisations that led an agitation against the admission of non-Hindu students to the shrine board-run medical college — held victory marches in Jammu, burst crackers and danced, Omar on Wednesday evening said it was unfortunate that people were celebrating the “closure of a medical college”. “In other parts of the country people fight to get such institutions,” he said. “If you are happy to destroy the future of our children, then go ahead and burst crackers.”The Sangharsh Samiti had been protesting since Nov against the admission of 42 Muslim students, mostly from Kashmir, in the first batch of 50, with only seven Hindus and one Sikh among the selected candidates. Its contention was that an institution funded by Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board should give preference to Hindu students and those who have faith in Mata Vaishno Devi.CM Omar said within two years, the institute’s intake capacity would have risen to 400, of which about 250 would have come from Jammu. “Now, no one will get those seats because the college has been closed in the name of religion,” he said. Students who fail to secure admission in medical colleges in future should remember the role played by the Sangharsh Samiti in closing this institute, he added.On Tuesday, barely an hour before the NMC order, the CM had said the medical college was not worth running given the religious politics played around it, and had suggested shutting it down. “In the given scenario, I don’t feel the students themselves would like to study there. We request GoI and the health ministry to adjust these children in other colleges. Had I been a parent of these students, I wouldn’t send them there,” Omar had said.Although NMC stated that the Letter of Permission was being withdrawn as an inspection found non-compliance with minimum standards, the Sangharsh Samiti claimed it was a result of its prolonged agitation. “This is our first major victory,” its representatives said at a news briefing, adding, “Our current protest has ended but there are more issues, like the Shrine Board Act which needs amendment.”BJP’s J&K president and Rajya Sabha member Sat Sharma, too, welcomed the NMC decision, and thanked LG Manoj Sinha and Union health minister J P Nadda, for withdrawal of permission while safeguarding the interests of selected students.Kashmir-based parties, however, slammed the decision, terming it Jammu’s loss, and blamed BJP. NC minister Javed Rana said admissions in educational institutions shouldn’t be sought on the basis of religion. He accused BJP of “communalising” the issue of admissions in SMVDIME.PDP called it “a ruthless setback” for Jammu region, and blamed BJP. “People of Jammu must wake up to the reality that religious polarisation only sabotages their future. This entire episode was cynically engineered by BJP for narrow political gains in the name of religion, and it is Jammu that has been made to pay the price,” PDP youth wing president Aditya Gupta said.","J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah reacted sharply, accusing them of playing with the future of students.

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Tuesday said the safety of people in Venezuela is India’s primary concern amid the crisis following US military operations in the country and the capture of President Nicolas Maduro and his wife.Speaking in Luxembourg, Jaishankar urged all parties involved in the crisis to sit down and reach a position that serves the well-being of the people of Venezuela.“I think we put out a statement yesterday, so I would urge you to look at it.

We are closely monitoring the evolving situation,” the MEA said in a statement.“We call upon all concerned to address issues peacefully through dialogue, ensuring peace and stability in the region.

He was chargesheeted for attempt to murder and other offences under IPC. The wife had also filed for divorce and sought maintenance.Facing incarceration for the grave offence, the man approached his wife, showed repentance and persuaded her to settle for a compromise, following which she withdrew the divorce petition. Soon, the man moved the Himachal high court for the quashing of charges on the ground that the couple were now living together peacefully. The HC refused to quash the charges, terming them grave in nature.Advocate Sukumar Pattajoshi, appearing for the man, pleaded Wednesday with an SC bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and S C Sharma, citing the the welfare of the young couple, who got married in 2020, and said the compromise was reached through the elder’s intervention.The state counsel opposed the plea, but the bench said, “No doubt it is a grave offence, but the couple’s wishes to stay together and give their married life a fresh chance should be respected. Sending the man to jail would not be in the interest of the family.”It issued a stern warning and asked him to give a written undertaking that he would take good care of his wife and child and not do anything detrimental to their interests and safety. Pattajoshi said he had agreed to appear for the man only after he gave an undertaking to that effect.Adding a caveat that it was quashing the criminal charges given the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case,it accepted the man’s written undertaking for amiable behaviour towards his wife and child and warned him of drastic consequences if he breached the undertaking.“If you do anything to the wife and child, you will be sent to jail straight away. Since Supreme Court will be sending you to jail, no court in the country will grant you bail,” the bench told the man who was present in court.",The man from Himachal Pradesh wounded his wife with a knife and flung their three-year-old son from the first floor. He was chargesheeted for attempt to murder and other offences under IPC. The wife had also filed for divorce and sought maintenance.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126404096,imgsize-81092,width-400,resizemode-4/supreme-court.jpg"

MUMBAI: A day after Congress and BJP councillors in Ambernath unveiled an alliance for the local municipal council, Congress state brass condemned the decision and suspended its partymen while CM Devendra Fadnavis said he would recommend action against the local office-bearer.BJP had forged a post-poll understanding with Congress and Ajit Pawar's NCP, securing a majority of 31 seats, even though Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena was the single largest party with 27 members. The formation was named Ambernath Vikas Aghadi.Congress has suspended its local block chief, Pradeep Patil, along with all 12 elected councillors and issued show-cause notices. In a letter to Patil, the party informed him its block unit had been dissolved.State party president Harshwardhan Sapkal said, ""We are against any alliance with BJP. We will decide on further action."" AICC secretary Sachin Sawant blamed BJP for wooing its councillors into an opportunistic alliance. ""BJP is hungry for power. It has also now tied up with its B-team, AIMIM, in another place (Akot) to get the council post."" BJP has won the most number of president posts in municipal councils in the state.However, since resolutions or proposals would need the majority's approval in the General Body, councillors have been forging alliances across the political divide in order to control the civic body's functioning. In Akot, BJP members formed Akot Vikas Manch with AIMIM, besides support from Shiv Sena UBT, Shiv Sena, NCP, Sharad Pawar-led NCP (SP) and Bachchu Kadu's Prahar Janshakti Party. The alliance's strength stood at 25.""I am making it very clear that any alliance with Congress or AIMIM will not be accepted.

He claimed the leadership had suspended the councillors without hearing their side.

He also alleged that Sapkal demanded Rs 1 crore from him in exchange for the post of block president, but he had refused to comply, after which Congress leader Mukul Wasnik facilitated his appointment.

NEW DELHI: Linking the mounting trade tensions between India and United States with the capture of Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro in the CIA-led operation, Maharashtra's former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan on Tuesday asked: ""Will Trump kidnap our Prime Minister?""Chavan said the central government has been making an effort to diversify the supply source to give a cushion to the exporters hit by the US President Donald Trump's 50 percent tariff on India.""With a 50 percent tariff, trade is simply not possible. In effect, this amounts to blocking India–US trade, especially exports from India to the United States. Since a direct ban cannot be imposed, tariffs have been used as a tool to stop trade. India will have to bear this,"" Chavan said in an interview to news agency IANS.He further said: ""The profits that our people earlier earned from exports to the US will no longer be available. We will have to look for alternative markets, and efforts in that direction are already under way"".""The question then is: What next? Will something like what happened in Venezuela happen in India? Will Mr. Trump kidnap our Prime Minister?"" Chavan asked.Criticising Chavan over his remark, BJP's national spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari said: Congress sinks to a new low every day. Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan shamelessly comparing India’s situation with Venezuela. By asking whether “what happened in Venezuela can happen in India”, Congress is making its anti-India mindset clear. Rahul Gandhi wants chaos in Bharat. Rahul Gandhi is seeking foreign intervention in Bharat’s affairs!""Earlier in the day, Chavan criticised the government for not taking a stand after the US captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, saying such an incident could also happen to India.“Whatever has happened in Venezuela is against the UN Charter. An elected president has been kidnapped. It's a very grave concern that it could happen to any other country tomorrow. Tomorrow it can happen to India,” Chavan said.“India has not spoken as usual, not taken a stand on the Venezuela matter. Russia and China have taken a stand and criticised what America has done. The same thing happened in the Ukraine war. We did not take any side. We did not take a stand on the Israel-Hamas matter, and now here we are, so scared of Americans that we are not even trying to criticise what has happened,” he added.However, the ministry of external affairs on Sunday reiterated India’s support for the safety and well-being of people in Venezuela as the situation in the country remains tense after the US strikes.""Recent developments in Venezuela are a matter of deep concern. We are closely monitoring the evolving situation,"" the MEA said in a statement.Trump on Monday issued a fresh tariff warning to India, saying Washington could raise duties on New Delhi if it does not “help on Russian oil issue,” directly linking the threat to the ongoing Russia–Ukraine war.“We could raise tariffs on India if they don't have help on Russian oil issue,” said US President Trump, quoted by Reuters.US President Donald Trump added, ""They wanted to make me happy, basically... PM Modi's a very good man. He's a good guy. He knew I was not happy. It was important to make me happy. They do trade, and we can raise tariffs on them very quickly...""Trump was referring to India’s continued oil trade with Russia, a point his administration has repeatedly opposed, and which he had cited as the basis for doubling tariffs on India to 50% in August 2025.India is already facing the 50% tariff imposed by Trump, who has been sharply critical of New Delhi’s ties with Moscow and has alleged India of strengthening Russia in the Ukraine war by purchasing Russian crude.",Prithviraj Chavan said the central government has been making an effort to diversify the supply source to give a cushion to the exporters hit by the US President Donald Trump's 50 percent tariff on India.

PALGHAR: An alleged ragging incident at a private medical college hostel in Maharashtra’s Palghar district has led to police action and the suspension of a hostel warden and a teacher, after a female student was reportedly forced to perform namaz, according to news agency PTI.The incident occurred on Sunday night at the institute located in Posheri village of Wada taluka. It triggered tension on campus and drew protests from right-wing groups, following which police were deployed to prevent any disturbance.Police registered an FIR on Monday night. Early findings indicate that the episode may be linked to ragging, an official said.According to the complaint, the victim is a first-year physiotherapy student from Nashik. She alleged that while she was on the fifth floor of the hostel, she was stopped by a girl whose face was covered. The accused allegedly tried to force her to perform Islamic prayers and continued to pressure her even after she refused, leaving her frightened.“The victim informed her family the following morning, who then approached the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) after allegedly receiving no response from the college management,” a police official said.Palghar Superintendent of Police Yatish Deshmukh visited the campus to assess the situation.“We have registered a case under relevant sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) and the Maharashtra Prohibition of Ragging Act. We are scanning the CCTV footage and recording statements of other students to identify the accused,” SP Deshmukh said, adding that strict action would be taken against those found guilty.Amid public outrage, the college administration suspended a hostel warden and a teacher as part of its immediate action.VHP activists later submitted a written complaint to the police, demanding a high-level probe into the college’s functioning. They claimed that similar incidents had occurred earlier as well.However, a representative of the college management denied these allegations, stating that no such incident had taken place in the past, while assuring full cooperation with the police investigation.Police deployment remains heavy in the area to ensure peace and maintain communal harmony.","The incident occurred on Sunday night at the institute located in Posheri village of Wada taluka.

The TOI correspondent from Washington:

Trump Boasts Of 68 Apaches For India As Contracts And Delivery Data Expose The Claim As False





US President Donald Trump pulled another hyperbole out of his MAGA hat on Tuesday, claiming that India had ordered 68 Apache attack helicopters from the United States, the delivery of which was so slow that Prime Minister Narendra Modi deferentially sought a meeting with him to raise concern over the delays.A review of official contracts, delivery records, deployment details and conversations with military and diplomatic sources shows that the claim does not align with facts: India ordered only 28 Apache helicopters in total, and as of December 2025, all of them have been delivered.The discrepancy reinforces a pattern critics have frequently noted in Trump’s public remarks where numbers are often inflated and timelines simplified to emphasise US leverage or personal involvement, like for instance in his persistent claim that he forced India and Pakistan into a truce with threat of tariffs. In this case, while delivery delays were real and did frustrate New Delhi, the scale described by Trump was not; neither was his claim that PM Modi asked “Sir, may I see you, please?” to raise the issue.In Trump’s recalls, everyone – even foreign leaders (except Putin and Xi Jinping) – is always calling him “sir.”India’s acquisition of the Boeing AH-64E Apache Guardian helicopters took place in two distinct phases, not one massive order.The first deal was signed in September 2015, during the final months of the Obama administration, when India signed an agreement to buy 22 Apaches for the Indian Air Force (IAF) in a contract worth about $2.2 billion. These helicopters were delivered on schedule, with the final units arriving by 2020 during the first Trump administration. They were inducted into two frontline squadrons and quickly became a central part of India’s attack helicopter capability.The second deal was signed in February 2020 during Trump’s visit to India. This follow-on contract, valued between $600 million and $800 million, covered six Apaches for the Indian Army Aviation Corps. This is the order that experienced repeated delays and became a talking point in US and Indian political discussions, including PM Modi flagging it during his visit to the White House in February 2025, one of many topics that were on the agenda. Combined, both deals amount to 28 helicopters—less than half of the figure cited by Trump.While the Air Force’s Apaches arrived on time, delivered at the end of Trump’s first term, the Army’s six helicopters were significantly delayed. Deliveries were initially scheduled to begin in early 2024. Instead, the first batch reached India only in July 2025—about 15 months late. The final three helicopters arrived in December 2025, completing the order nearly two years behind schedule.Several factors contributed to the delays. Boeing’s Apache production line in Mesa, Arizona, was affected by post-pandemic supply chain disruptions, including shortages of engines, gearboxes, and specialised electronics. In addition, India reportedly had a relatively low priority ranking within the US defence priorities and allocations system (DPAS) in 2024, meaning other customers—including the US. Army—were ahead in the queue for certain components.There were also technical and logistical complications. Boeing briefly paused some Apache deliveries worldwide due to electrical and power-generation concerns that required additional safety testing. In a final twist, the last batch bound for India in November 2025 had to turn back mid-flight after Turkey denied overflight clearance to the Antonov-124 transport aircraft carrying the helicopters, adding several more weeks of delay.Also read: 'If they don't help on Russian oil issue...'; Donald Trump's new tariff warning to India; praises PM Modi These genuine frustrations likely form the basis of Trump’s comments, but the numerical exaggeration undermines their credibility. Is it possible that Trump may have conflated two separate Indian helicopter purchases from Boeing: the AH-64E Apache attack helicopter and the CH-47F Chinook heavy-lift helicopter? Both deals were signed around the same time, both involved Boeing (for which Trump claimed to be the all-time best salesman), but they still add up to only 43, since India ordered 15 Chinooks, all of which have been delivered between 2019 and 2020. There is no record in India’s ministry of defence or US foreign, military Sales (FMS) notifications of any additional Apache orders beyond the 28 units. While the Army originally projected a requirement for 39 Apaches, no new contracts have been signed.In fact, despite the Apache’s formidable firepower, India’s experience with dodgy US supply chains issues and increasingly mercurial strategic shifts vis-a-vis China and Pakistan is such that it is now peeling away from American, and for that matter, any foreign dependency. Instead, New Delhi is increasingly prioritising indigenous solutions under its “Make in India” policy. In this case, it is leaning on the HAL Prachand Light Combat Helicopter. A lighter chopper optimized for extreme altitudes, Prachand can operate where the heavier Apache struggles, including at heights above 20,000 feet like in Siachen. India plans to induct 156 Prachand helicopters across the Army and Air Force, gradually reducing reliance on foreign attack helicopters.The emerging strategy is clear: Apaches will remain India’s heavy strike platforms in plains and desert sectors, but the future of India’s rotary-wing combat power will be increasingly domestic. Trump’s claim of 68 helicopters may have overstated the scale, but it has inadvertently highlighted why India is determined to avoid dealing with a maverick.","India’s acquisition of the Boeing AH-64E Apache Guardian helicopters took place in two distinct phases, not one massive order.

Candace Owens’ claims about Charlie Kirk and the alleged shooting image







Candace Owens recently made strong claims about Charlie Kirk , but there is one very important thing readers need to know first. There is no verified or official record that Charlie Kirk was assassinated or shot. Still, Candace Owens shared what she said was a never-before-seen photo and talked about it during an episode of her show. Her comments quickly spread online and started new debates.According to Candace Owens, the image showed Charlie Kirk from behind at the moment she claims he was shot. She said there was no blood and no exit wound visible in the photo. This claim surprised many people and raised questions on social media. However, no police department, hospital, or university has confirmed such a shooting. Charlie Kirk has also appeared publicly after the time Candace Owens referred to.Candace Owens used this photo while explaining why she said she does not trust Terryl Farnsworth and Tyler Bowyer. Her words caught attention fast, but many people also questioned the accuracy of her statements.While speaking on her show, Candace Owens said the photo showed Charlie Kirk from behind with no visible blood after the alleged shooting.Pointing to the image, she said the only blood seen was on his hand.Candace Owens said, “This doesn’t make sense to me.

US Attacks Again! Russian-Flagged Ship Linked To Venezuela CAPTURED; Pentagon CONFIRMS Strike

US seizes two Venezuela-linked oil tankers





Venezuela’s interior minister Diosdado Cabello announced late Wednesday that 100 people were killed during the US military operation that ousted President Nicolás Maduro on Saturday — the first casualty figure provided by Caracas.The Venezuelan army has previously posted a list of 23 of its dead, and Cuban officials reported that 32 Cuban military and intelligence personnel were also killed.Cabello said Maduro was wounded in the leg and his wife, Cilia Flores — who was detained alongside him — suffered a head injury during the raid.The minister, speaking on state television, praised Venezuelan forces as 'courageous' and highlighted a week of mourning declared by acting President Delcy Rodríguez for those killed during the operation.Meanwhile, the US seized two Venezuela-linked oil tankers in the Atlantic and Caribbean, including a vessel that had been sailing under Russia’s flag, as part of President Donald Trump ’s intensified effort to control oil shipments tied to Caracas and enforce sanctions.US forces have been tightening a naval blockade targeting ships under sanctions that are transporting or attempting to transport Venezuelan crude. The operation comes shortly after US special forces captured Maduro in a dramatic raid in Caracas.In the North Atlantic, the Russian-flagged tanker Marinera — formerly known as Bella 1 — was intercepted early Wednesday after a weeks-long pursuit and changes in name and flag intended to evade the blockade, officials said. The US Coast Guard and military boarded the vessel under a federal court warrant for alleged sanctions violations.A second ship, the Panama-flagged M/S Sophia, was also boarded and taken into US custody in the Caribbean Sea. US authorities said both tankers were either last docked in Venezuela or en route to it, and had been sanctioned for illicit activities tied to Venezuelan oil shipments.The Russian government has condemned the seizure of the Marinera as a violation of international maritime law, calling it “blatant piracy,” though there were no reported clashes during the operation.","Venezuela’s interior minister Diosdado Cabello announced late Wednesday that 100 people were killed during the US military operation that ousted President Nicolás Maduro on Saturday.

‘WAITING FOR YOU!’: Petro Dares Trump To Invade Colombia After Venezuela & Capture Him | Watch

Trump's post on Truth Social





US President Donald Trump and Colombian President Gustavo Petro had their first phone call after recent trading of harsh words. The 35-minute conversation happened just days after Trump accused Petro of drug trafficking and made threats about possible US military action in Latin America, like the one in Venezuela. Both leaders agreed to meet in person soon.Trump shared news of the call on his social media platform Truth Social, saying, ""It was a Great Honor to speak with the President of Colombia, Gustavo Petro, who called to explain the situation of drugs and other disagreements that we have had."" He added that he looked forward to meeting Petro soon.""I appreciated his call and tone, and look forward to meeting him in the near future. Arrangements are being made between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the Foreign Minister of Colombia. The meeting will take place in the White House in Washington, DC,"" he added.The call came at a tense time. Trump had recently called Petro a ""sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States,"" and even suggested he supported military action against Colombia when asked by a news reporter.The situation got more serious when Petro responded to US strikes on Venezuela. He warned about defending Colombia's sovereignty, saying ""If you bomb peasants, thousands of guerrillas will return to the mountains.""He also cautioned that arresting him would ""unleash the popular jaguar.""Taking protective measures, Petro sent 30,000 Colombian soldiers to guard the border with Venezuela on Sunday.Trump's tough talk wasn't just aimed at Colombia. He also threatened to send US military forces after drug cartel leaders in Mexico and suggested Cuba's government might fall without Venezuela's support.The Colombian government described the call between the two leaders as ""good and positive,"" showing signs of possible improvement in the strained relationship between the two countries.",President Donald Trump and Colombian President Gustavo Petro had their first phone call after recent trading of harsh words.

Minneapolis: ICE Vehicles Attacked, Protests Erupt After Immigration Agent Kills American Woman

What is happening in Minneapolis?







An ICE officer in its major immigration crackdown fatally shot a woman driving an SUV through her car window in South Minneapolis on Wednesday. US President Donald Trump called the incident ""horrible thing to watch"" and said that the woman was ""a professional agitator.""The deadly confrontation escalated the intensity of situation in what was already heated-up immigration raid on Minnesota and its immigrants by Donald Trump administration. The administration confirmed the shooting and also informed that the woman was a rioter who in her vehicle attempted to run over law enforcement officers.A video of the incident immediately surfaced widely over social media, showing a Honda SUV apparently blocking unmarked law enforcement vehicles as they attempt to drive down a street that was covered with snow.The driver, identified by local media as 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, tried to drive away as officers approached and attempted to open her door, prompting one agent to fire three shots as the vehicle pulled off.In the video, an officer is heard ordering the driver to get out of the car and attempting to open the door, after which the driver slowly reverses and then moves forward as if trying to flee. An officer positioned at the front fires three shots, and the SUV travels a short distance at point-blank before crashing into a parked car.The woman was taken to Hennepin County Medical Center, where she was pronounced dead, according to the Minneapolis police chief.Trump, who has ordered nationwide anti-immigration raids, accused the woman of trying to “viciously” run over the agent. Trump reacted to the event, taking to his Truth Social, he wrote: ""I have just viewed the clip of the event which took place in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It is a horrible thing to watch. The woman screaming was, obviously, a professional agitator, and the woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defense. Based on the attached clip, it is hard to believe he is alive, but is now recovering in the hospital.He further added in the post, ""The situation is being studied, in its entirety, but the reason these incidents are happening is because the Radical Left is threatening, assaulting, and targeting our Law Enforcement Officers and ICE Agents on a daily basis. They are just trying to do the job of MAKING AMERICA SAFE. We need to stand by and protect our Law Enforcement Officers from this Radical Left Movement of Violence and Hate!""ICE's federal agents have played a central role in the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement and deportation push, despite objections from some local officials.Last summer, the department of homeland security (DHS) launched an aggressive recruitment drive to add 10,000 ICE agents to its existing force of about 6,000, drawing criticism that newly deployed officers lacked adequate training.DHS secretary Kristi Noem said “any loss of life is a tragedy” but described the incident as “domestic terrorism,” alleging that Good had been stalking and obstructing ICE operations throughout the day. She said Good later “weaponized her vehicle.”The incident took place during protests against immigration enforcement in southern Minneapolis, in the midwestern state of Minnesota.DHS, which oversees ICE, said in a post on X that the woman had attempted to run over an officer, who then fired what it described as ""defensive shots.""The administration deployed hundreds of agents to the city on Wednesday in what officials described as the largest crackdown since a Minnesota welfare fraud case drew national attention. Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey said he was aware of the shooting involving an ICE agent and called for federal immigration officers to leave the city “immediately.”“The presence of federal immigration enforcement agents is causing chaos in our city,” Frey said in a statement on social media. “We’re demanding ICE leave the city immediately. We stand rock solid with our immigrant and refugee communities.”Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, who withdrew from the governor’s race following the welfare controversy, said his office was working to “gather information on an ICE-related shooting this morning.”","US President Donald Trump called the incident ""horrible thing to watch"" and said that the woman was ""a professional agitator"" The driver, identified by local media as 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, tried to drive away as officers approached and attempted to open her door.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126405732,imgsize-1181996,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order directing the withdrawal of Washington from 66 international organisations, conventions and treaties. The White House said continued participation in these bodies was deemed “contrary to the interests” of the country.The order, signed on Wednesday, covers 35 non-UN organisations and 31 United Nations entities, marking one of the largest rollbacks of US engagement with multilateral institutions in recent years.Announcing the decision, the White House said the move was guided by the administration’s “America First” policy. In a post on X, it said, “Today, President Donald J Trump signed a Presidential Memorandum directing the withdrawal of the United States from 66 international organizations that no longer serve American interests”.According to the executive order, Trump instructed all executive departments and agencies to take immediate steps to put into effect the withdrawals as soon as possible. For UN entities, withdrawal would involve ending participation or funding, to the extent permitted under US law.The memorandum said the decision was taken after reviewing a report submitted by the Secretary of State and after consultations with Cabinet members.It concluded that US participation or financial support for these organisations was redundant, wasteful, mismanaged or misaligned with national priorities and in some cases posed a threat to US sovereignty and prosperity.“The Trump Administration has found these institutions to be redundant in their scope, mismanaged, unnecessary, wasteful, poorly run, captured by the interests of actors advancing their own agendas contrary to our own, or a threat to our nation’s sovereignty, freedoms, and general prosperity,” the State Department said in a statement.Among the non-UN organisations, the US will exit several major climate, environment and energy-related bodies. This includes the India- and France-led International Solar Alliance, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).Other bodies include the International Renewable Energy Agency, International Energy Forum, Global Counterterrorism Forum, Partnership for Atlantic Cooperation and several regional and development-focused institutions.On the UN side, the withdrawals include agencies dealing with economic development, climate change, gender equality, population, peacebuilding and water. This includes organizations such as the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), UN Population Fund, UN Women, UN Energy and UN Water.The decision comes nearly a year after the Trump administration withdrew the United States from the World Health Organization (WHO) in January 2025, citing the agency’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. The US also exited Unesco in July 2025, arguing that continued membership was not in the country’s national interest.The administration had also suspended support for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa). These moves reflected Washington’s increasingly selective, a-la-carte approach to multilateral engagement, under which the administration chose to fund and participate only in institutions it believed aligned with President Trump’s agenda and US interests.Experts and former officials have warned that the decision could weaken global cooperation on climate change, public health and development. Scientists said that the US withdrawal from climate-focused bodies may slow international efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions and address extreme weather events.“The US withdrawal could hinder global efforts to curb greenhouse gases because it gives other nations the excuse to delay their own actions and commitments,” said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson.The UN Population Fund, another key exit, has long faced opposition from Republican leaders. Trump previously cut its funding during his first term, alleging involvement in coercive abortion practices. However, the claims were later rejected by a US State Department review.Analysts said that the move reflects a broader shift in Washington’s approach to multilateralism. “I think what we’re seeing is the crystallization of the US approach to multilateralism, which is ‘my way or the highway. It's a very clear vision of wanting international cooperation on Washington’s own terms,” said Daniel Forti of the International Crisis Group.Despite the withdrawals, US officials have said that Washington will continue to engage selectively in global institutions where it sees strategic competition with China, such as in telecommunications, maritime and labour-related bodies.These include bodies focused on climate, energy, democracy, culture and regional cooperation, such as:","US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order directing the withdrawal of Washington from 66 international organisations, conventions and treaties.

“To say that I was extraordinarily satisfied, no, but also I don’t regret what I did,”

Views on responsibility, injury, and mental state

“Actually, I think that coming here, both times I did, was a f****g mistake. But to say that you all are extraordinarily bad, that would be neither bad nor good.”

“Honestly, my only regret is this thing in the eye,” he said, laughing. “But it was really hard, man.”

“I already know that you are going to say that I am mentally ill, or some shit like that,” he said. “That is all nonsense.”

“I am sane… I am sane, and… I’ve always been, more or less.”

“In my take on all of this,” he said, pausing repeatedly, “I think the world cannot be redeemed. To sum it all up, that is it.”





Federal assessment





Federal authorities say the man who killed two Brown University students and an MIT professor planned the attacks for at least six semesters and later recorded a series of videos in which he expressed no remorse, rejected apologies, and described the shootings as deliberate. The US Department of Justice released transcripts of the recordings on Tuesday, days after formally confirming the shooter’s death.The shooter, identified by law enforcement as Claudio Neves Valente, was a 48-year-old Portuguese national and former Brown University student. On 13 December, he opened fire inside an engineering building at Brown University, killing two students, Ella Cook and MukhammadAziz Umurzokov, and wounding nine others.Two days later, on 15 December, Valente fatally shot Nuno F.G. Loureiro at his home in Brookline, Massachusetts. Loureiro was an MIT professor and had attended school in Portugal decades earlier with Valente.On Thursday, 18 December 2025, the US Attorneys’ Offices, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives jointly announced Valente’s death. He was found dead inside a storage facility in Salem, New Hampshire.During a federal search of the storage unit, investigators recovered an electronic device containing several short videos Valente recorded after the shootings.In a statement released by the US Department of Justice, officials said the FBI recovered the device while executing a federal search warrant on 18 December. The videos were recorded in Portuguese and later translated into English.“In these videos, Neves Valente admitted that he had been planning the Brown University shooting for a long time,” the department said, adding that he did not provide a motive for targeting either the Brown students or the MIT professor.In the recordings, Valente said he had been planning the attack for more than six semesters and claimed he had numerous chances to carry it out earlier, but did not. In one video, he said he had “plenty of opportunities” but “always chickened out”.Across more than 11 minutes of footage, Valente spoke about the shootings, addressed how he was portrayed in the media, complained about a self-inflicted eye injury, and repeatedly rejected the idea that he owed anyone an apology.In another, he said:He framed his actions as intentional and final. He said his goal was to “leave on his own terms” and made clear he felt no regret for the killings themselves. In a DOJ statement, Valente was described as having “showed no remorse during the recordings”.the transcript reads.Valente also spoke at length about how he expected his actions to be interpreted. He dismissed claims that he was motivated by hatred of the United States, saying instead that the shootings were about opportunity rather than ideology.“When I say that I have no hatred toward America, I also have no love for it,” he said, before adding:He complained repeatedly about a serious eye injury he said he sustained during the attack on the MIT professor, describing it as the only thing he regretted.Valente rejected the suggestion that mental illness explained his actions.He insisted:Near the end of one recording, as the lights in the storage facility began to dim, Valente reflected on his worldview.The DOJ said Valente showed no remorse in the recordings and instead blamed others while complaining about his injuries.“He exposed his true nature when he blamed innocent, unarmed children for their deaths at his hand and grumbled about a self-inflicted injury,” the department said.Officials said the investigation into motive remains ongoing, but added that based on the evidence reviewed so far, authorities do not believe there is any immediate continuing public safety threat linked to the shootings. Additional updates will be provided promptly as more information is developed and after appropriate victim family notifications.","US Department of Justice released transcripts of the recordings on Tuesday.

"CIA turncoat Aldrich Ames, who sold US secrets to Soviets, dies in jail at 84",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/cia-turncoat-aldrich-ames-who-sold-us-secrets-to-soviets-dies-in-jail-at-84/articleshow/126404767.cms,"



WASHINGTON: Aldrich Ames, the most murderous turncoat in the history of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), whose betrayal in working for the Soviet Union went undetected for almost a decade, died Monday. He was 84 and had been a federal prisoner, serving life without parole, since 1994.The death was recorded in the federal bureau of prisons inmate database. The son of an alcoholic CIA officer, Ames failed upward through the agency ranks for 17 years until he attained a headquarters post of extraordinary sensitivity.He became the chief of counterintelligence of the CIA’s Soviet division in Sept 1983. He had access to some of the nation’s deepest secrets: in particular, its clandestine liaisons with the Soviets, who worked in secret with US intelligence.As the Cold War was cresting, Ames decided that he would change the course of history by upending a long-running game of nations, the contest of spy versus spy. He saw it as a charade. By his own account, he was fuelled by a toxic cocktail of vodka, arrogance, delusions of grandeur and greed.In April 1985, he took his first gamble. He hand-delivered an envelope addressed to the KGB chief at the Soviet Embassy in Washington.He offered a smattering of CIA secrets, and he requested $50,000 in return. Ames feared that one of the CIA’s Russians might betray him, so he decided to betray them all. He knew he would be paid a fortune.“I panicked,” he said in a 1994 interview with the New York Times, conducted from jail. “Only by suddenly giving them everyone” would he be protected — and he knew in return that he would be paid “as much money as I could ever use, if I chose to do that.”Ames put together hundreds of secret documents in a 6-pound stack — a who’s who of Soviets working for the CIA and an encyclopedia of US intelligence operations behind the Iron Curtain. He stuffed them in his briefcase, walked out of headquarters and delivered them to a contact at the Soviet Embassy. “I was delivering myself along with them,” he said in the interview. The KGB took care of him — he was paid $2.7 million — and it took care of its own turncoats.As many as 10 Soviet and Soviet-bloc spies were arrested, interrogated and executed for treason. The network that had provided the US with political, military, diplomatic and intelligence insights on Moscow was destroyed. Ames also revealed the identities of two dozen other US intelligence officers and foreign agents working for the CIA and exposed some 50 secret operations in Russia, Europe and Latin America, the agency concluded. As the CIA’s Russians disappeared, one by one by one, the agency began to fear that it had a traitor in its midst. But the search for the mole sputtered and ground to a halt.In 1989, a CIA officer reported that Ames, on returning to Washington, was inexplicably wealthy: He had paid $540,000 in cash for a new home and he was driving a new Jaguar. It was not until 1993 that a probe began, spurred in large part by the FBI. The FBI put handcuffs on Ames in 1994. His wife, who went by Rosario, was arrested too — she knew about his treason and spent the proceeds — and received a five-year jail term.","Aldrich Ames, the most murderous turncoat in the history of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), whose betrayal in working for the Soviet Union went undetected for almost a decade, died Monday.

US Senator Lindsey Graham said President Donald Trump has approved a bipartisan Russia sanctions bill that would give the White House broader authority to target countries buying Russian oil, a move he said could strengthen US leverage as the war in Ukraine continues.Graham announced the development in a post on X after what he described as a productive meeting with Trump. He said the legislation has been in the works for months with Senator Richard Blumenthal and other lawmakers and could come up for a vote as early as next week.“After a very productive meeting today with President Trump on a variety of issues, he greenlit the bipartisan Russia sanctions bill that I have been working on for months with Senator Blumenthal and many others,” Graham wrote.He said the timing of the bill was important, arguing that Ukraine was making concessions toward peace while Russia continued its military campaign. “This will be well-timed, as Ukraine is making concessions for peace, and Putin is all talk, continuing to kill the innocent,” he said.According to Graham, the bill would allow the US president to penalise countries purchasing discounted Russian oil, which he said was helping finance Moscow’s war effort.“This bill will allow President Trump to punish those countries who buy cheap Russian oil fueling Putin’s war machine,” he wrote.He added that the proposed sanctions would give Trump leverage over major buyers of Russian oil. “This bill would give President Trump tremendous leverage against countries like China, India and Brazil to incentivise them to stop buying the cheap Russian oil that provides the financing for Putin’s bloodbath against Ukraine,” Graham said.Graham said he expected strong bipartisan backing for the legislation and expressed hope that it could be taken up by the Senate as early as next week.",US Senator Lindsey Graham said President Donald Trump has approved a bipartisan Russia sanctions bill.

Buy Greenland? Take It? Why? An old pact already gives Trump a free hand,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/buy-greenland-take-it-why-an-old-pact-already-gives-trump-a-free-hand/articleshow/126404718.cms,"President Trump's desire to acquire Greenland for national security is complicated. A 1951 defense pact already grants the US extensive military access and base-building rights. Despite this, Trump's talk of buying the island faces strong opposition from Greenlanders and Denmark, who emphasize self-determination and the island's inalienable status.

Greenland Revolt: Sen. Kennedy Breaks Ranks With Trump, Delivers Shock Speech On Potential Invasion





President Donald Trump has ridiculed Denmark's dog sled teams in Greenland.He has cited mysterious Chinese and Russian ships prowling off the coast.He seems increasingly fixated on the idea that the United States should take over this gigantic icebound island, with one official saying the president wants to buy it and another suggesting that the United States could simply take it. Just a few days ago, Trump said: ""We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security.""But the question is: Does the United States even need to buy Greenland -- or do something more drastic -- to accomplish all of Trump's goals?Under a little-known Cold War agreement, the United States already enjoys sweeping military access in Greenland. The United States has one base in a very remote corner of the island. But the agreement allows it to ""construct, install, maintain and operate"" military bases across Greenland, ""house personnel"" and ""control landings, takeoffs, anchorages, moorings, movements, and operation of ships, aircraft and waterborne craft. ""It was signed in 1951 by the United States and Denmark, which colonized Greenland more than 300 years ago and still controls some of its affairs.""The US has such a free hand in Greenland that it can pretty much do what it wants,"" said Mikkel Runge Olesen, a researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies in Copenhagen.""I have a very hard time seeing that the US couldn't get pretty much everything it wanted,"" he said, adding, ""if it just asked nicely.""But buying Greenland -- something Secretary of State Marco Rubio told lawmakers Tuesday was Trump's latest plan -- is a different question.Greenland does not want to be bought by anyone -- especially not the United States. And Denmark does not have the authority to sell it, Olesen said.""It is impossible,"" he said.In the past, Denmark would have been the decider. In 1946, it refused the Truman administration's offer of $100 million in gold.Today, things are different. Greenlanders now have the right to hold a referendum on independence, and Danish officials have said it's up to the island's 57,000 inhabitants to decide their future. A poll last year found 85% of residents opposed the idea of a US takeover.Greenland's prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, has repeatedly scoffed at the idea of being bought, saying this past week, ""Our country is not for sale.""The relatively short, straightforward defense agreement between the United States and Denmark was updated in 2004 to include Greenland's semiautonomous government, giving it a say in how US military operations might affect the local population. The roots of the agreement go back to a partnership forged during World War II.(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)At that time, Denmark was occupied by the Nazis. Its ambassador in Washington, cut off from Copenhagen, took it upon himself to strike a defense agreement for Greenland with the United States. (The island is part of North America, along the Arctic Ocean and close to Canada's coast.)The fear was that Nazis could use Greenland as a steppingstone to the US The Germans had already established small meteorological bases on the island's east coast and relayed information for battles in Europe. US troops eventually ousted them and established more than a dozen bases there with thousands of troops, landing strips and other military facilities.After World War II, the United States continued to run some bases and a string of early warning radar sites. As the Cold War wound down, the United States closed all of them except one. It's now called the Pittufik Space Base and helps track missiles crossing the North Pole.The Danes have a light presence, too: a few hundred troops, including special forces that use dog sleds to conduct long-range patrols. In recent months, the Danish government has vowed to upgrade its bases and increase surveillance.(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)After US special forces captured Nicolás Maduro, the president of Venezuela, from a safe house last week, Trump seemed emboldened. Stephen Miller, a top aide, then claimed that Greenland should belong to the United States and that ""nobody's going to fight the United States"" over it. Danish and Greenlandic anxiety skyrocketed.On Tuesday night, Danish and Greenlandic leaders asked to meet with Rubio, according to Greenland's foreign minister. It's not clear if or when that might happen.Tensions between Trump and Denmark's prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, have been steadily rising, as Trump pushes to ""get"" Greenland, as he puts it, while Frederiksen refuses to kowtow to him.Just a few days ago, Frederiksen cited the 1951 agreement, saying, ""We already have a defense agreement between the kingdom and the United States today, which gives the United States wide access to Greenland."" She urged the United States ""to stop the threats"" and said a US attack on Greenland would mean the end of the international world order.European leaders issued their own statement Tuesday, also citing the 1951 agreement and saying, ""Greenland belongs to its people.""Analysts said that if the United States tried to use the defense pact as a fig leaf to send in a lot of troops and try to occupy Greenland, that wouldn't be legal either.According to the 2004 amendment, the United States is supposed to consult with Denmark and Greenland before it makes ""any significant changes"" in its military operations on the island. The 2004 amendment, which was signed by Gen. Colin Powell, who was then the secretary of state, explicitly recognizes Greenland as ""an equal part of the kingdom of Denmark.""Peter Ernstved Rasmussen, a Danish defense analyst, said that in practice, if US forces made reasonable requests, ""the US would always get a yes.""""It is a courtesy formula,"" he said. ""If the US wanted to act without asking, it could simply inform Denmark that it is building a base, an airfield or a port.""That's what infuriates longtime Danish political experts. If Trump wanted to beef up Greenland's security right now, he could. But there has been no such official US request, said Jens Adser Sorensen, a former senior official in Denmark's parliament.""Why don't you use the mechanism of the defense agreement if you're so worried about the security situation?"" he said, adding, ""The framework is there. It's in place.""But Greenland's strategic location is not the only thing that has attracted Trump's inner circle. The enormous island has another draw: critical minerals, loads of them, buried under the ice. Here, too, analysts say, the United States doesn't need to take over the island to get them.Greenlanders have said they are open to doing business -- with just about anyone.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.","A 1951 defense pact already grants the US extensive military access and base- building rights.

US President Donald Trump said the United States should set its military budget for 2027 at $1.5 trillion instead of $1 trillion, arguing that the higher allocation is necessary to build what he called a “Dream Military” capable of deterring any adversary and keeping the country safe.Trump made the announcement in a post on Truth Social, saying the decision followed discussions with lawmakers and senior officials. He said the expanded budget would strengthen national security at a time he described as “very troubled and dangerous”.“After long and difficult negotiations with Senators, Congressmen, Secretaries, and other Political Representatives, I have determined that, for the Good of our Country, especially in these very troubled and dangerous times, our Military Budget for the year 2027 should not be $1 Trillion Dollars, but rather $1.5 Trillion Dollars,” Trump wrote.He said the increased spending would allow the US to build a military force that would keep the country “SAFE and SECURE, regardless of foe”.Trump also linked the proposed increase to revenues generated from tariffs, claiming they had created financial room for higher defence spending. “If it weren’t for the tremendous numbers being produced by Tariffs from other Countries, many of which, in the past, have ‘ripped off’ the United States at levels never seen before, I would stay at the $1 Trillion Dollar number,” he said.MAGA chief added that tariff income now made it possible to fund a larger military while also reducing debt and providing financial benefits to Americans. He contrasted the situation with the previous administration, saying the revenues being generated were “unthinkable in the past”.","US President Donald Trump said the United States should set its military budget for 2027 at $1.5 trillion instead of $1 trillion.

A woman was shot dead during a confrontation involving federal immigration agents (ICE) in south Minneapolis on Wednesday, with a witness disputing the Trump administration's claim that the shooting was an act of self-defence and the woman was trying to run over officers.Emily Heller told MPR News that shouting outside her home woke her up, and she saw a tense scene on the road. She said a car was blocking traffic and appeared to be part of a protest against federal law enforcement activity in Minnesota. She lives near 33rd Street and Portland Avenue, where the incident took place.Heller said ICE agents were shouting at a woman driver, telling her to “get out of here”. According to Heller, the woman was attempting to turn her car around to leave when an agent stepped directly in front of the vehicle and shot her in the face.“She was trying to turn around, and the ICE agent was in front of her car, and he pulled out a gun and put it right in — like, his midriff was on her bumper — and he reached across the hood of the car and shot her in the face like three, four times,” Heller told MPR.Heller said the car then accelerated and crashed into a utility pole and other parked vehicles nearby. The driver was seen slumped over the steering wheel, with blood visible inside the car in social media videos.Federal authorities gave a different account and perspective of the incident. In a statement, ICE said the agent fired after “fearing for his life” during a ""violent"" confrontation with the woman, and acted in self-defence.“Today, ICE officers in Minneapolis were conducting targeted operations when rioters began blocking ICE officers and one of these violent rioters weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them,” the statement said.“An ICE officer, fearing for his life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots,” it added.ICE said the woman was killed and that the injured officers were expected to recover.The shooting came a day after the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced its largest-ever operation was underway in Minnesota. The agency said 2,000 officers were being deployed to the Twin Cities as part of the huge immigration crackdown. The GOP government has shown its hostility towards the large Somali community living in the Blue states, with leaders like Elon Musk and JD Vance calling for their deportations. Moreover, a recent, alleged scam, fraud came to light, which is also under investigation.Social media users claimed the woman was a legal observer.

Can the owners be deported?





A row erupted after a MAGA influencer called for the deportation of Indian American hotel owners who refused to provide rooms to immigration enforcement officers, and that even US citizenship should not protect them.Conservative commentator Andrew Branca weighed in on the incident on X after reports emerged that a Hampton Inn by Hilton in Minnesota cancelled reservations made by officials from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).“These four Indian-American owners of the Hampton Inn in Minneapolis who canceled the reservations for DHS simply because DHS was enforcing immigration law, look, if they're here on visas, obviously deport them,” Branca said.He added that they should be stripped of their privilege: “But even if they're naturalized citizens, they should be denaturalized and then deported.”He added that America is no place for those who act against its interests: “When we grant the precious gift of American citizenship to a foreign national, it's with the understanding that they're going to act in the interests of the United States, not contrary to those interests.”An X user confronted Branca and said the owners are just practising their rights according to US Constitution: ""So deport them because they exercise their first amendment rights? Do you know how insane you sound?""To this argument, Branca replied with 8 words: ""Deport them because they are not cultural Americans.""Public records show the Hampton Inn by Hilton in Lakeville, Minnesota, was purchased last year for $15 million by four Indian American partners through a limited liability company (LLC). The owners are listed as Parmjit Singh, Amanpreet Hundal, Karandeep Nagra and Mohinderjeet Kaur.The controversy began after emails went viral on social media showing hotel staff informing colleagues that reservations made by DHS and ICE must be rejected. One email stated, “We have noticed an influx of GOV reservations made today that have been for DHS, and we are not allowing any ICE or immigration agents to stay at our property.”Hilton confirmed the hotel is independently owned and said the incident does not reflect the company’s values.Under US law, only non-citizens can be deported. That means people in the country on a visa or with a green card can be removed if they violate immigration rules or certain laws. Green card holders may face deportation for crimes, immigration fraud, abandoning residency or other serious issues. A naturalised US citizen generally cannot be deported, unless the government first proves their citizenship was obtained unlawfully and a court revokes it through a formal denaturalisation process.In the case of Hampton Hotels, refusing rooms to federal agents is not a crime under US law. Private hotels may legally deny service, unless discrimination is based on protected classes.",Conservative commentator Andrew Branca weighed in on the incident on X.

What will happen to Nato if US took Greenland?





US secretary of state Marco Rubio on Wednesday announced that he will be meeting officials in Denmark next week.""I'll be meeting with them next week,"" Rubio told news agency APThe demand for Greenland is not a hidden fact. Earlier, the Danish PM said that if the United States decided to attack another Nato country, which is Greenland, then everything would stop, including Nato.Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen on Monday said that the Greenland takeover means the end of the Nato military alliance, DW reported.Frederiksen said that ""everything would stop"" when it comes to cooperation with Washington in the event of a US attack on another Nato member.""If the United States decides to attack another Nato country, then everything would stop — that includes Nato and therefore post-World War II security,"" Frederiksen said.Trump, from the very beginning, has made its clear about his intentions. Trump’s long-standing scepticism of Nato — from scolding “delinquent” allies to questioning whether America should defend Europe at all — has already rattled capitals across the continent. A recent summit papered over the cracks with higher defence pledges and flattery, but the fissures never really closed.During the 2024 election campaign, Donald Trump said he would not protect “delinquent” Nato members that did not meet the then target of spending 2% of GDP on defence.His defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, emphasised in February that the US was no longer “primarily focused” on defending Europe, as per the Guardian.The comments provoked alarm in Europe, but diplomacy ahead of June’s Nato summit appeared to have eased the problem. Nato allies, except Spain, agreed to lift defence spending to 3.5% of GDP by 2035, following comments by secretary general Mark Rutte, who called the US president “daddy”.While it seems that Trump has no interest in Nato, voila! new thing happened. In a post on Truth Social on Wednesday, Trump said that the US will always be there for Nato, even if they won’t be there for the country.""Remember, for all of those big Nato fans, they were at 2% GDP, and most weren’t paying their bills, UNTIL I CAME ALONG. The USA was, foolishly, paying for them! I, respectfully, got them to 5% GDP, AND THEY PAY, immediately. Everyone said that couldn’t be done, but it could, because, beyond all else, they are all my friends. Without my involvement, Russia would have ALL OF UKRAINE right now. Remember, also, I single-handedly ENDED 8 WARS, and Norway, a Nato Member, foolishly chose not to give me the Noble Peace Prize. But that doesn’t matter! What does matter is that I saved Millions of Lives,"" he said in a post.Europe’s postwar security order faces a potential breaking point if the United States moves to annex Greenland in 2026. European leaders increasingly believe the Trump White House is seriously considering such a step, framing it as a matter of Arctic security while quietly exploring diplomatic, legal and economic pathways to assert control. For Europe, the stakes go far beyond Greenland’s 57,000 residents: a US annexation of Nato territory would shatter the assumption that Washington remains a reliable ally rather than a predatory power. Yet Europe’s response options are painfully limited. The continent is still deeply dependent on US military capabilities, intelligence and nuclear deterrence, and its rearmament drive will take years to mature. That dependence has already been exploited, most notably when Europe accepted punitive trade tariffs to avoid provoking a US withdrawal from Ukraine and Nato. Greenland now looks like a replay of the same coercive playbook, Times magazine reported.US officials argue Denmark cannot adequately secure the Arctic against Russia and China, but European leaders counter that existing Nato frameworks already give Washington extensive military access. This fuels suspicion that the real objective is territorial expansion rather than security.Nato’s membership might not change even if the US took Greenland, as the treaty had no clear provision for expelling a country. Its preamble committed the US and other allies “to live in peace with all peoples and all governments” and “to safeguard the freedom, common heritage and civilisation of their peoples”, wording once intended for use against a member that became communist during the Cold War.One alliance member turning on another, even over an Arctic territory with a population of less than 60,000, would undermine the credibility of the 76-year-old military alliance intended to ensure peace and mutual protection across Europe and the North Atlantic.Marion Messmer, a director at the Chatham House thinktank, said the latest threats had already caused damage at a time when the Russian menace felt more real, even as Moscow remained heavily embroiled in Ukraine. “If any European states harbour any illusions they can rely on US security guarantees, then this is the wake-up call we are not returning to that world,” Messmer said.",Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen on Monday said that the Greenland takeover means the end of the Nato military alliance. Trump’s long-standing scepticism of Nato — from scolding “delinquent” allies to questioning whether America should defend Europe at all — has rattled capitals across the continent.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126399798,imgsize-80742,width-400,resizemode-4/ai-image.jpg"
