Poll Which event do you think had a greater impact on the outcome of the 1971 war? Military Strategy International Support

NEW DELHI: The Army once again on Wednesday reflected on the 1971 India-Pakistan war that led to the liberation of Bangladesh and the division of Pakistan into two, posting under the title ""This Day That Year"" with reference to the ""Build Up of War. ""The Army’s Eastern Command shared newspaper clippings from August 6, 1971, on X. One clipping carried the headline ""Burma-Pakistan Air Pact,"" highlighting Pakistan’s preparations and military build-up against India at the time.Another clipping, headlined ""Another Pak Diplomat Quits,"" pointed to the worsening situation caused by widespread protests and unrest in what was then East Pakistan, now Bangladesh.These developments were unfolding as Pakistan geared up to confront India, eventually leading to the full-scale war that began on December 3, 1971. The conflict ended on December 16, lasting less than two weeks.India emerged victorious, with the Pakistan army surrendering around 93,000 troops, the largest military surrender since World War II.A day earlier, on Tuesday, the Army had posted another reminder of history, recalling how the United States had backed Pakistan during the 1971 war.This reminder came a day after India strongly rejected Trump’s warning of higher tariffs over its energy trade with Russia, calling the US and EU criticism “unjustified and unreasonable.”US President Donald Trump has also promised to help build ""massive oil reserves"" in Pakistan and announced a 25 per cent tariff on India with ""penalty"" for its oil imports from Russia.Trump’s tilt toward Pakistan comes amid strained India-Pakistan ties after the Pahalgam terror attack , which India retaliated against with Operation Sindoor","The Army once again reflected on the 1971 India-Pakistan war that led to the liberation of Bangladesh.

NEW DELHI: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday led a massive protest rally in Jhargram, denouncing the alleged attacks on Bengali-speaking migrants outside the state and accusing the BJP of orchestrating a campaign to harass Bengalis in the name of citizenship and voter list revision.“How can someone be branded as Bangladeshi if he or she speaks in Bengali?” Banerjee questioned while addressing the gathering. “This is nothing but a conspiracy to harass our people,” she added.She also warned that she would expose the BJP if attacks on the Bengali language and its people continue. “If you attack Bengali language and Bengal's people, I will expose BJP before the world,” she said. “If you attack Bengali language and Bengal's people, I will not stay silent,” she added.The rally, centered around the message that the Bengali language and identity “will never be silenced,” saw Banerjee walking nearly three kilometers through the tribal region. She was joined by senior Trinamool Congress leaders, cultural figures and local residents carrying placards that read ""Banglar Apoman Sojjyo Hobe Na"" (Insult to Bengal won't be tolerated) and ""Bangla Amar Ma"" (Bengal, my mother).The rally witnessed widespread participation from migrant families, students and local leaders, as Banerjee positioned herself as the defender of Bengali pride, language and identity.The protest was held in response to allegations of harassment and discrimination against Bengali-speaking migrants in different parts of India.She also expressed strong objections to what she called a deliberate attempt to marginalize Bengalis. “What right does the Assam government have to send NRC notices to people of Bengal?” she questioned.Banerjee further alleged that the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of the voter list was being used as a tool to bring the National Register of Citizens (NRC) through the backdoor. “The SIR exercise is being undertaken to bring NRC through the backdoor. People are already dying by suicide out of fear,” she alleged.She cautioned officials against excluding genuine voters from the electoral rolls. “Not a single elector should be omitted from the voter list in the name of Special Intensive Revision,” she asserted. Taking a dig at the BJP, she said, “They are trying to make a BJP list, not a voter list.”Slamming the BJP's demand for citizenship documents, Banerjee said, ""Do BJP leaders themselves have their birth certificates? What right do they have to question the identity of others?""","West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee led a massive protest rally in Jhargram.

""Withdrawing sanction to prosecute is unheard of in criminal jurisprudence,"" he said.Referring to Tiwari's ""politically motivated petition"" argument, Justice Bhuyan told Naidu, ""This is a malady not confined to Tamil Nadu alone. It is spread to the entire country. If you open a Pandora's box, it will come back to you one day"".Tiwari said that investigations were carried out in the cases and taken to logical ends.

We will confine the proceedings to these four cases, which appear to be serious"".On the prayer of the petitioner to transfer trial in these cases against politicians to another state, the bench said it would create complications over appointment of public prosecutor (PP).

House Attached, Police Crack Down





LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh STF gunned down dreaded mafia criminal Ashish Ranjan alias Chhotu Singh, a resident of Dhanbad, Jharkhand, in an encounter near Shivrajpur Chauraha under Shankargarh police station limits in Prayagraj in the wee hours of Thursday.Ashish, wanted in at least four high-profile murder cases, including that of gangster Aman Singh, opened fire with an AK-47 rifle and a 9mm pistol at the STF team, prompting retaliatory action in which he was critically injured and later declared dead, said Additional DG, law and order, Amitabh Yash.ADG Yash said that acting on a tip-off that Ashish was en route to Prayagraj to possibly execute a major criminal plot with an associate, the STF laid a trap near Shivrajpur.“When intercepted, Ashish fired at the police team with lethal intent. STF officers JP Rai, Prabhanjan, and Rohit narrowly escaped bullets. In self-defence, the STF retaliated, injuring Ashish, who was rushed to a nearby hospital but succumbed to injuries,” said ADG Yash.From the spot, police recovered a loaded AK-47, 9mm pistol, large cache of live cartridges and spent shells, and a motorcycle. A case under multiple sections, including attempt to murder and Arms Act, has been lodged, and further investigation is underway, the officer added.STF said that Ashish had a long criminal history and was the prime accused in three high-profile murder cases in Dhanbad, including, the murder of police informer and coal trader Neeraj Tiwari in Katras on September 5, 2021. The murder of land dealer Sarful Hasan alias Lala Khan in Wasseypur on May 12, 2021. The murder of Ranjit Sahu in Jharia.Previously, Ashish had been jailed in the Samir Mandal land mafia murder case but was released on bail, after which he continued to commit heinous crimes. Jharkhand Police and CID had both been hunting him, and a permanent warrant had been issued against him.Ashish came into the spotlight after he claimed responsibility for the murder of mafia don Aman Singh inside Dhanbad Jail, in a viral audio-video confession. The feud reportedly began after Ashish accused Aman of plotting his murder. Police suspect the conspiracy to eliminate Aman was hatched in Nepal, where Ashish is believed to have been hiding before resurfacing in UP. A key accused in Aman’s murder, Ritesh Yadav alias Sundar Mahto, had told police that he met Ashish in Nepal days before the murder.Following his repeated absconding, police had already initiated property attachment proceedings at Ashish's residence in JC Mallick Road, Dhanbad, on orders of SDJM Poonam Kumari in September 2024.In two separate FIRs—one related to the murder of Neeraj Tiwari and the other involving land dealer Lala Khan—his house and belongings were seized by the local police. Ashish has over a dozen serious criminal cases registered against him.","Ashish Ranjan alias Chhotu Singh, a resident of Dhanbad, Jharkhand, was gunned down in an encounter near Shivrajpur Chauraha.

Indians Outrage in Dublin After Vicious Attack on Amazon Techie, Demand for Justice in Ireland





: A six-year-old Indian-origin girl and an Indian sous chef are the latest victims in the ongoing spate of racist attacks targeting Indian nationals and Indian-origin Irish people in Ireland.The girl, whose family hail from Kottayam, Kerala, was playing outside her house in Waterford City, southeast Ireland, with friends at 7.30pm on Monday evening when a gang of boys and one girl called her a “dirty Indian” and told her to “go back to India”. She was born in Ireland. Five of the gang also punched her in the face, hit her private parts with a bicycle, punched her neck and twisted her hair.Her mother moved to Ireland eight years ago from Kottayam to work as a nurse with her husband and recently became an Irish citizen.The mother said the gang was made up of boys aged 12 to 14 and a girl aged eight. She said her daughter came home in floods of tears and is now too scared to play outside. She told the Irish Mirror: “I never expected that such an incident would happen. I thought she would be safe here. Even in front of our own house she can’t play safely. I am a nurse, I am doing my best to take care of people. I do my work and I am 100% professional. I changed my citizenship, but still we are called dirty people and even my kids are not safe.We came here to fill a labour gap. We are professionals — we have all the certificates…”The mother studied BSc Nursing at University of Calicut and went to Mount Carmel Higher Secondary School in Kottayam.“Gardaí (Irish national police) responded to a report of an alleged assault in the Kilbarry area of Waterford city on the evening of Monday 4 August. Investigations are ongoing,” a Garda spokesperson told TOI.On Wednesday morning Laxman Das from Kolkata, who works as a sous chef at the Anantara The Marker Dublin hotel, was assaulted near the Hilton Hotel by three people while on his way to work. He was taken to St Vincent's University Hospital.

Salman Iftikhar, a wealthy London businessman, has been jailed for 15 months for his 2023 outburst on a London-Lahore Virgin Atlantic flight, where he threatened an airhostess with gangrape, accusing her of being racist. ""You called me a P*ki in front of everybody,"" Iftikhar told the airhostess adding that she would be dragged out of her hotel room, gangraped and set alight.On February 7, 2023, Iftikhar was flying on the Virgin Atlantic flight in first class with his wife and three children. The argument started when Iftikhar was drinking at the onboard bar and taking ice with his hands. ""Mr Iftikhar was seen drinking champagne at the onboard bar, where he was talking to cabin crew,"" said prosecutor Abdul Kapadia. ""During the defendant's first meal service, the defendant was seen helping himself to ice, leaning over bar he was drinking at, and taking ice with his hands.""When told to stop, the defendant became irate, and started to film cabin crew with his phone, telling them: 'Do not tell me what to do, you b**ch. When asked by the cabin crew to return to his seat, he then said: 'Don't tell me what to do you racist f**king b**ch. I know where you are from in Cardiff.'""The pilot was informed about the altercation and he turned the seat belt lights on so that everyone went back to their seats. ""The defendant's behaviour became worse. The cabin crew discussed a diversion to Turkey. The defendant was informed of this possible diversion, to which he replied: 'I don't care. F**k it, go to Turkey. I have contacts.' The defendant then sat down, but his aggressive behaviour continued. His wife was ashamed. His three children were also on-board, and other crew members were called to assist, but the defendant continued shouting and swearing,"" Kapadia told the court.""He was slurring his words, with his voice raised. He shouted at the cabin crew: 'Do you know who I am?' The defendant's wife went to the food bar and tried to talk to cabin crew, but the defendant pushed his wife away, and shouted at her not to talk to crew. A crew member stabilised the wife's arm to prevent her from falling when she was pushed,"" the court was told.Iftikhar also threatened to blow up the floor of the Avari Lahore Hotel, where the cabin crew were due to stay. ""You will be dead on the floor of your hotel,"" he threatened the crew and then he turned towards the airhostess and said: ""You will be dragged by your hair from your room and gang raped and set on fire"".His three young children were crying and pleading for him to stop.When the flight landed in Lahore, no action was taken against Iftikhar, but he was arrested on March 16, 2024, from his home in Iver, Buckinghamshire.Iftikhar has six previous convictions arising from 15 offences, including common assault in 2004 and drink driving in 2008. According to his LinkedIn profile, he is the director and founder of the recruitment firm Staffing Match.The air hostess told the court she had to take 14 months off work as she was traumatized by the threat of being gangraped.","Salman Iftikhar, a wealthy London businessman, has been jailed for 15 months for his 2023 outburst on a London-Lahore Virgin Atlantic flight.

Russell Wilson’s wife Ciara blasted for ‘disrespectful’ sheer dress — critics say she emasculated NFL star,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/russell-wilsons-wife-ciara-blasted-for-disrespectful-sheer-dress-critics-say-she-emasculated-nfl-star/articleshow/123142059.cms,"Ciara's daring sheer gown at the Vanity Fair Oscar party in March 2023 ignited social media (Getty Images)

Ciara’s sheer Vanity Fair dress sparked outrage — but was the backlash rooted in misogynoir?

A viral clapback and a deeper cultural critique

In March 2023, Ciara set social media ablaze after stepping onto the Vanity Fair Oscar Party red carpet in a daring, crystal-studded sheer gown designed by Peter Dundas. The dress, which revealed a thong and bared most of her back, triggered a wave of criticism — but the nature of the backlash raised deeper questions about how Black women are policed for expressing their bodies.Many online critics took issue with Ciara’s outfit not simply because it was revealing, but because she is a wife and mother. Culture writer Tiwa Adebayo noted the hypocrisy of this reaction, especially since other celebrities — including Emily Ratajkowski and Hunter Schafer — wore similarly revealing dresses that night but were largely spared the same judgment.“It looks like the biggest group criticizing her, especially on Twitter, is actually Black men,” said Adebayo, who connected the outrage to respectability politics and the perception that Ciara’s choice of attire reflected poorly on her husband, NFL quarterback Russell Wilson . “They've taken [the dress] and applied it to her husband... implying he doesn't have control over his woman in quite a damaging way.”Ciara responded to the backlash with humor, posting a TikTok where she strutted in a full white sheet to audio from her red carpet moment. She captioned it “selective outrage” — a pointed nod to the inconsistency in how society treats women’s fashion choices, particularly for Black women.Race and gender therapist Donna Oriowo reminded critics, “Her husband is her partner, not her owner.” She added, “Too often we equate love with ownership, and maleness with dominance over a wife.”The controversy surrounding Ciara's dress was not an isolated event but part of a larger pattern, one that disproportionately targets Black women for breaking unspoken social rules.As Adebayo concluded, “It’s symptomatic of a wider trend of having contradictory high standards for Black women.” More than just a fashion statement, Ciara’s dress forced a cultural reckoning with deep-rooted double standards.Also Read: Russell Wilson’s wife Ciara slammed for shaming single women and telling them to ‘act like wives’ to get a man","Ciara’s sheer Vanity Fair dress sparked outrage — but was the backlash rooted in misogynoir?

Taylor Swift’s NFL presence adds a new dimension



When President Donald Trump stirred controversy with a dig at Taylor Swift , declaring she is ""NO LONGER HOT"" after praising actress Sydney Sweeney- social media instantly lit up. Trump’s remarks, made on Truth Social, sparked a whirlwind of reactions. Fans didn’t just rally around Swift, they also turned their eyes to Travis Kelce , waiting to see how the NFL star would respond. But instead of a fiery comeback, Kelce made a far more calculated choice: silence.Rather than feeding the flames, Kelce refrained from going public with any backlash. But silence, in this case, wasn’t indifference. According to a Daily Mail insider, “Taylor knows exactly how Travis feels about this situation with Trump, and privately they are on the same page.” Behind closed doors, Kelce is said to be fully supportive, “with continued love and respect,” while publicly choosing to “let Trump be a sandbag and let it slip by for now. ”This measured response aligns perfectly with Kelce’s public persona- cool-headed, focused, and never one to fuel tabloid fire. Another source close to the situation explained, “He is looking to take the high road, and only express his frustrations to Taylor and their family.”Rather than turning political discourse into a performance, Kelce is prioritizing stability and respect, especially when the spotlight often burns brightest on Swift.As Taylor Swift wraps her record-breaking Eras Tour in December 2024, she’s preparing to show up in a new role- NFL spectator. A source from People revealed that she plans to “attend as many of his games as possible.” With no tour schedule in the way, this will be Swift’s first real NFL season as Kelce’s full-time supporter, shifting the focus from stage lights to stadium lights.The timing couldn’t be more interesting. With Trump openly favoring the New England Patriots, and whispers of a potential playoff face-off between the Patriots and Chiefs, the stage could be set for a spectacle that blends celebrity, politics, and football in one surreal arena.But no matter how wild things get this season, Kelce’s unwavering loyalty will likely remain the foundation. Amid the noise, his quiet actions continue to reflect not just love, but leadership. In the world of public opinion and private battles, sometimes silence is the strongest stand.Also Read: “I feel guilty”: Christian McCaffrey can’t stop admiring Olivia Culpo’s strength in emotional message after baby’s arrival","President Donald Trump stirred controversy with a dig at Taylor Swift.

By: Ashok Singh ShekhawatJHUNJHUNU: A gruesome incident in Kumawas village, located in the Nawalgarh area of Jhunjhunu district, has sparked outrage by animal activists after at least two individuals were filmed shooting and killing more than 25 dogs. The horrific act was committed on Aug 2 and 3 but it wasn't until a video surfaced on social media on Wednesday that local police acted.The video footage shows two individuals on a motorcycle chasing and firing at stray dogs with a gun, leaving their bodies scattered across village streets and fields. Another person on a second bike is partially seen in the same video following and filming the duo on the first bike. It was unclear if the individual on second bike was complicit in the crime.Preliminary police probe later identified one of the accused as Shyochand Bavariya, a resident of Dumra village. Local police have registered a case against Bavariya under multiple sections of the Animal Cruelty Act and the Arms Act.The incident has sparked outrage among animal lovers and local residents, who are calling for strict action against the perpetrators.Superintendent of Police, Jhunjhunu, Brijesh Jyoti Upadhyay confirmed the video's authenticity and dispatched head constable Shubhkaran to the village for further investigation.

"Uttarakhand Cloudburst: Kalp Kedar, temple ‘built by Pandavas’, lost beneath debris; locals mourn loss of spiritual anchor",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/uttarakhand-flood-fury-last-traces-of-centuries-old-panch-kedar-lost-below-debris-homes-destroyed-orchards-swept-away/articleshow/123130822.cms,"



DEHRADUN: The Kheer Gad river surged through without warning, tearing through Dharali - a village that holds its history in the soil. The flash flood halved the settlement, destroying homes and orchards, and burying what little remained of its oldest monument: the Kalp Kedar temple, a shrine dedicated to Shiva and, as local lore has it, built by the Pandavas during their exile.Only the temple's dome - long visible above ground since a glacial shift in the early 20th century submerged the rest - had endured. Carved with the face of Kalabhairava, it remained a visible fragment of something larger and unseen. Now, that too is gone, covered by fresh silt, boulders and broken timber. The Shivling has stayed hidden beneath earth and water for generations.In the 1980s, residents had tried to excavate the structure, but the Shivling never emerged - as though resisting visibility. That mirrored the lore: Shiva, unwilling to grant the Pandavas absolution, is said to have scattered himself across the Himalayas, each fragment becoming a site of worship. Kalp Kedar, believed by locals to be a prototype of Kedarnath, was one of those pieces - half-visible, always revered. ""This wasn't just a flood. It took the heart of the village,"" said Manoj Rana, former pradhan, surveying the damage.Set at an altitude of 650 metres (2,100 feet) above sea level, it was once a key halt on the Indo-Tibetan trade route.The Bhotia traders moved wool and salt through these hills, and many settled in nearby Bagori and Harsil, blending Buddhist and Hindu traditions. While Dharali does not lie on the formal Panch Kedar route, villagers consider Kalp Kedar part of that sacred constellation - not geographically, but spiritually. Its submerged form, they believe, was no accident but part of the same divine refusal that defines the myth: a god withdrawing from view, leaving only fragments behind. Brijesh Sati, general secretary of the Char Dham Teerth Purohit Mahapanchayat, said, ""The temple was near the bridge. Kalp Kedar had immense importance for the region. It was restored by Adi Shankracharya and worshipped as one of the oldest shrines to Shiva.""In the village's modern history came the British deserter Frederick Wilson, known locally as Pahadi Wilson, who made Harsil his home in the mid-19th century. He introduced apple saplings and red rajma to the region - both of which reshaped Dharali's economy. Today, the village exports apples across northern India. The trees remain, but the terraces along the river were swept away this week. Several orchards were flattened. Footbridges leading to fields were carried off downstream. Entire homes - including those belonging to long-settled families - were torn in half.Just 6km from Harsil, Dharali also serves as a base for Himalayan treks, including the Gaumukh-Tapovan and Lama Top routes. It lies close to Gartang Gali, a century-old wooden bridge carved into the rock face that was once used by Indo-Tibetan traders. But Dharali has never been a destination in itself. It has existed between paths - passed through, not always visited, known more to pilgrims and orchardists than to tourists.","Dharali was once a key halt on the Indo-Tibetan trade route.

BHIWANDI: An accident occurred at the construction site of the Thane-Bhiwandi-Kalyan Metro Line 5 when a long iron rod fell from the metro bridge. The rod directly pierced the forehead of a passenger travelling in an autorickshaw on the road below. The passnger sustained serious injuries.The injured passenger was identified as Sonu Ali (20), a resident of Vitthal Nagar in Bhiwandi.The construction work is underway on the first phase of the Thane-Bhiwandi metro route. The police said the incident took place on Tuesday around 2 pm.While Sonu Ali was travelling in an autorickshaw, the rod, seven to eight feet long and 20 mm thick, fell directly on to the moving autorickshaw. The rod pierced through the rickshaw and into the passenger's head, leaving him covered in blood. Despite the severity of the injury, he remained conscious.Learning about the incident, the police, with the help of the autorickshaw driver, rushed the injured person to the private Nobel Hospital, where he is undergoing treatment. After learning about the incident, local workers of the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) staged a road blockade protest to express their anger.The MNS workers demanded that a criminal case be filed against the contractor concerned. The police are investigating the cause of the accident and determining who is responsible.The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) imposed a total penalty of Rs 55 lakh on two companies involved in the construction of Metro Line 5 after the tie rod from the site fell on the autorickshaw and left the passenger injured.While a Rs 50 lakh fine was levied on civil contractor Afcons, the general consultant, Systra-CEG-Systra (India), was penalised Rs 5 lakh for supervisory lapses.The incident took place two months after the tie rod—part of a temporary support structure to a deck slab—was installed. It gave way unexpectedly, crashing on to the auto and injuring the commuter on board.An independent inquiry has now been initiated under the chief safety manager of AICA, the general consultant for Metro Line 2B, to ensure a neutral and expert inquiry. Further action will follow based on the findings, MMRDA said.Following the incident, safety heads of both Afcons and Systra rushed to the hospital where the injured passenger was admitted, and MMRDA directed Afcons to bear the full cost of medical treatment and provide additional support to the victim.An MMRDA official said, ""We deeply regret the incident. Public safety and accountability are paramount to us. Immediate steps have been taken not only to penalise those at fault but also to identify systemic gaps and plug them.""",The accident occurred at the construction site of the Thane-Bhiwandi-Kalyan Metro Line 5.

Poll Do you believe that referring to Bengali as the 'Bangladeshi national language' is offensive? Yes, it's highly offensive. No, it's just a misunderstanding.

At a Durand Cup match, East Bengal fans made a stirring political statement that resonated far beyond the football pitch.East Bengal FC edged past Namdhari FC 1-0 in their Group A clash, but it was the strong message from the stands that caught everyone's attention.Fans held up a powerful poster that read: ""Yesterday, we were hanged fighting for India’s freedom. And today, for speaking our mother’s tongue, we become Bangladeshi?""The protest gained added significance amid a fresh controversy involving the Bengali language.On Sunday, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee strongly criticized the Delhi Police for referring to Bengali as the ""Bangladeshi national language"" in an official letter related to an investigation under the Foreigners Act. Banerjee condemned the reference as “insulting, anti-national, and unconstitutional.”The letter in question was addressed to the officer-in-charge of Banga Bhawan, the West Bengal government’s official guest house in Delhi. It requested a translator following the arrest of eight individuals suspected of illegally entering India from Bangladesh.Banerjee shared the letter on her Facebook page, expressing outrage and calling out the Delhi Police, which operates under the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India.“See now how Delhi Police under the direct control of the Ministry of Home, Government of India, is describing Bengali as 'Bangladeshi' language!” Banerjee wrote.She emphasized that Bengali is not only her mother tongue but also the language of literary and cultural icons like Rabindranath Tagore and Swami Vivekananda. She noted that both India’s national anthem ‘Jana Gana Mana’ by Tagore and the national song ‘Vande Mataram’ by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay were written in Bengali.“... the language in which crores of Indians speak and write, the language which is sanctified and recognised by the Constitution of India, is now being described as a Bangladeshi language!!” she stated.The Trinamool Congress supremo called the central government “anti-Bengali” and urged people to protest what she termed anti-Constitutional language.“Scandalous, insulting, anti-national, unconstitutional!! This insults all Bengali-speaking people of India. They cannot use this kind of language, which degrades and debases us all. We urge immediate, strongest possible protests from all against the anti-Bengali Government of India, who are using such anti-Constitutional language to insult and humiliate the Bengali-speaking people of India,” she said.The Trinamool Congress also shared the controversial letter on their official handle on X (formerly Twitter).","West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee strongly criticized the Delhi Police for referring to Bengali as the ""Bangladeshi national language"" The reference was made in an official letter related to an investigation under the Foreigners Act.

'We’ll Start From East': Pakistan Issues Fresh Threat To India, Asim Munir Outlines New Approach





Pakistan army chief General Asim Munir is expected to visit the United States again, his second trip in just two months, according to official sources in Islamabad, as reported by Dawn.The visit is aimed at holding consultations with his American counterparts.Pakistan General Munir had earlier visited Washington in June, where he was hosted by President Donald Trump for a lunch at the White House.Following that, Pakistan tried to strengthen ties further by lobbying for a Nobel Peace Prize nomination for Trump.The meeting between Munir and Trump happened amid escalating tensions between India and Pakistan following the Pahalgam terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir, which was backed and sheltered by Pakistan and claimed 26 lives. In response, India launched a counterterror strike under Operation Sindoor.Speaking about the Nobel Peace Prize during that period, Trump said, “I should have gotten it four or five times. They won't give me a Nobel Peace Prize because they only give it to liberals.”Since Operation Sindoor, Trump has repeatedly claimed credit for helping establish a ""ceasefire"" between the two nuclear-armed nations.Trump recently announced a trade deal with Pakistan and offered US help in exploring what he described as ""massive oil reserves"" in the country.At the same time, relations between India and the US appear to have taken a hit. Trump has imposed a 25% tariff on Indian goods over India’s oil trade with Russia, especially crude imports. Just a week later, the Trump administration announced an additional 25% tariff, bringing the total to 50%.","Pakistan army chief General Asim Munir is expected to visit the United States again, his second trip in just two months.

Here's what happened

CM blames ‘ religious fundamentalism ’

Child rights panel steps in





NEW DELHI: Police in Karnataka have arrested three men in connection with the poisoning of a school water tank that left 11 students hospitalised in Belagavi district two weeks ago.One of those arrested, Sagar Patil, is president of the Sri Ram Sene’s Savadatti taluk unit.The incident occurred at a government Kannada primary school in Hulikatti village, where toxic substances were mixed into the school’s drinking water supply.Belagavi Superintendent of Police Bhimashankar Guled told reporters that the accused intended to target the school’s headmaster, who belongs to a minority community.According to the investigation, the trio—Sagar Patil, Krishna Madar and Magangouda Patil—believed the poisoning would lead to the headmaster’s transfer.All 11 students who fell ill after consuming the contaminated water were treated and discharged from hospital.The accused have been remanded to judicial custody.Guled said Sagar Patil was the main conspirator. He allegedly coerced Krishna Madar into joining the plan by threatening to reveal his relationship with a girl from another community.Patil sourced the poison from Munavalli village and it was mixed into the tank water by a student relative.Chief minister Siddaramaiah condemned the incident as “a heinous act driven by religious fundamentalism and hatred”. He alleged the motive was to discredit the headmaster, who has served the school for 13 years, and force his removal.“This act could have resulted in the massacre of innocent children. It is a terrifying reminder of how religious bigotry and communal hatred can manifest in such inhuman ways,” the CM posted on X.Siddaramaiah also accused the opposition BJP of fostering a climate of religious polarisation. “Will Pramod Mutalik, BY Vijayendra, or R Ashok take responsibility for this?Leaders who support such anti-social elements must come forward and atone for their sins,” he said.He announced a special task force to monitor hate speech and prevent communal violence, urging citizens to resist divisive rhetoric and report provocations.In a separate incident in Shivamogga district, the Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (KSCPCR) initiated a suo motu complaint regarding pesticide contamination at a school in Hoovinakone village.The panel has sought a report from the district’s education department, calling the act “unforgivable”. KSCPCR member Shashidhar Kosambe praised the swift response of staff, which he said prevented a major tragedy.Shivamogga SP GK Mithun Kumar has formed three investigative teams to identify those responsible. Police have recovered the pesticide bottle used and are following leads.DSP Aravind Kalagujji is leading the probe, with 18 officers deployed in the area.Local residents expressed dismay at the tarnishing of their village’s image. A new water connection has been set up at the school, while the contaminated tank is being preserved as evidence.",Police in Karnataka arrest three men in connection with the poisoning of a school water tank that left 11 students hospitalised in Belagavi district.

The two had reportedly left home due to a family dispute, as per the police, reports the BBC.His brother, who was with Naseeruddin during the 1997 incident, said they had chosen an unconventional mountain route to avoid possible threats, reports the Express Tribune.He recalled hearing gunfire on their return journey, and in an attempt to escape the attackers, Naseeruddin took refuge in an icy cave, never to be seen again.An extensive search was carried out at that time, but Naseeruddin could not be traced, and a symbolic funeral was held at the location.With the body finally recovered after 28 years, his brother is returning to Lady Valley to determine whether to lay the remains to rest there or bring them back to the family’s ancestral home.Reduced snowfall in the region has left glaciers more exposed to direct sunlight, accelerating the ice-melting process, highlighting how higher temperatures are speeding up glacial melt, reports the BBC.","The body of a man missing for 28 years has been discovered in a melting glacier in Pakistan’s remote Kohistan region.

New York City Mayoral election: Former Governor slams Zohran Mamdani for his property in 'anti-LGBT' Uganda; Andrew Cuomo says 'silence is violence',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-york-city-mayoral-election-former-governor-slams-zohran-mamdani-for-his-property-in-anti-lgbt-uganda-andrew-cuomo-says-silence-is-violence/articleshow/123155519.cms,"



The New York City mayoral contest took a sharp turn when independent candidate and former Gov. Andrew Cuomo criticised socialist contender Zohran Mamdani regarding his property ownership in Uganda, a country known for its anti-LGBT stance.On Tuesday, Cuomo posted on X: ""The no-show assemblyman missed this interview while vacationing at his parents' compound in Uganda, a country that murders LGBTQIA+ people. Silence is violence. I hereby call on you to Boycott, Divest, and Sanction your property in Uganda and commit to stop spending tourism dollars there until they overturn their hateful, discriminatory laws which violate basic human rights.""Uganda-born Mamdani has received scrutiny for spending late June at his family's compound in Uganda. The New York Post reported that his wedding celebration there was protected by armed security personnel.Cuomo also called him the chameleon assemblyman and said, ""irst you were defund the police, now defund is “out of step” with your current view. Meanwhile, the DSA is bragging around town that they own you and their position is as clear as day… defund the police all the way to 0. Do you believe anything? Or will you just say whatever it takes?""Curtis Sliwa, a Republican opponent, pointed out the inconsistency in Mamdani's stance of advocating police defunding for New York residents while utilising extensive security during his overseas wedding.Cuomo's statement referenced Mamdani's ongoing support for BDS and sanctions against Israel, positions he has maintained since university.The Mamdani campaign was contacted by Fox News Digital for response. Uganda's stance against LGBT individuals has been consistent, with its Constitutional Court recently upholding legislation that permits capital punishment for ""aggravated homosexuality.""Mamdani's campaign website addresses LGBT issues: ""Queer and trans people across the United States are facing an increasingly hostile political environment. New York City must be a refuge for LGBTQIA+ people, but private institutions in our own city have already started capitulating to Trump's assault on trans rights.Meanwhile, the cost of living crisis confronting working class people across the city hits the LGBTQIA+ community particularly hard, with higher rates of unemployment and homelessness than the rest of the city. The Mamdani administration will protect LGBTQIA+ New Yorkers by expanding and protecting gender-affirming care citywide, making NYC an LGBTQIA+ sanctuary city, and creating the Office of LGBTQIA+ Affairs.

Russiagate: Tulsi Gabbard says Russia believed Hillary Clinton's 2016 victory 'inevitable'; claims Obama admin orchestrated hoax,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/russiagate-tulsi-gabbard-says-russia-believed-hillary-clintons-2016-victory-inevitable-claims-obama-admin-orchestrated-hoax/articleshow/123084080.cms,"Tulsi Gabbard (PTI)





Director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has claimed that Russian officials privately anticipated a Hillary Clinton victory was “inevitable” in the 2016 US presidential election, based on her assessment of recently released documents by her office.Speaking on Miranda Devine’s “Pod Force One” podcast, Gabbard has said that Russia had a strategy of undermining public trust in the American political system while preparing for a Clinton-based White House, despite the prevailing narrative that Russia was in support of Donald Trump “It surprised me that all of these documents still existed, quite frankly,” she said on an episode that is scheduled to release on Wednesday, reports the New York Post. “As we’ve learned in later documents that we’ve reviewed throughout that campaign, Russia believed that Hillary Clinton would win the election.“They felt it was inevitable,” she added.Tulsi Gabbard’s office last month began releasing a series of internal documents detailing how officials navigated the investigation into Russian interference during the 2016 elections.Among the disclosures was a 2020 House Intelligence Committee report, which alleged that Russian operatives may have obtained intelligence suggesting Hillary Clinton was “placed on a daily regimen of ‘heavy tranquilizers’” and was “afraid of losing.”“If Russia aspired to help Trump get elected, which is what the manufactured January 2017 intelligence community assessment says with high confidence, according to Brennan and Clapper, then Putin would have released the most damaging information and emails to help President Trump,” she said, questioning why the alleged Russian intelligence was never made public if Moscow truly had a goal to uplift Trump’s campaign.“It was intentionally withheld and not released because they assumed that Hillary Clinton would win that election, and their plan,” Gabbard said, reports the New York Post.Much of the material released by Gabbard focuses on challenging the findings of a 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA), which asserted, among other conclusions, that “the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.”Gabbard accused former President Obama of ordering the 2017 ICA of Russian interference in the 2016 election, highlighting the actions of his administration, outlined in the newly released documents.“Out of respect for the office of the presidency, our office does not normally dignify the constant nonsense and misinformation flowing out of this White House with a response. But these claims are outrageous enough to merit one,” a spokesperson for Obama said, slamming the revelations made by Gabbard.“These bizarre allegations are ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction. Nothing in the document issued last week undercuts the widely accepted conclusion that Russia worked to influence the 2016 presidential election but did not successfully manipulate any votes,"" said the Spokesperson.","Director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has claimed that Russian officials privately anticipated a Hillary Clinton victory was “inevitable” in the 2016 US presidential election. “It surprised me that all of these documents still existed, quite frankly,” she said on an episode that is scheduled to release on Wednesday.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123084128,imgsize-958982,width-400,resizemode-4/123084128.jpg"

Nicole Westmoreland, a member of Sean “Diddy” Combs’ high-profile legal team, said on Tuesday that the team has contacted the Trump administration to explore the possibility of a presidential pardon. This follows Combs’ recent conviction on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution.“It’s my understanding that we’ve reached out and had conversations in reference to a pardon,” Westmoreland said in an interview with CNN.US President Donald Trump suggested he was unlikely to pardon Combs in an interview with Newsmax last week. “I was very friendly with him, I got along with him great and he seemed like a nice guy. I didn’t know him well. But when I ran for office, he was very hostile,” he said.Despite Trump’s remarks, Westmoreland said this week that Combs “is a very hopeful person, and I believe that he remains hopeful.”Westmoreland has added that the case should never have been pursued by the government, arguing that their second misstep was “allowing it to keep it going.”“The government knew that there was no way Combs committed sex trafficking or RICO and they just continued prosecuting anyway,” she said.“I think the jury saw through it.”Combs has remained in custody since his arrest in September. While he was acquitted last month of the more serious charges of racketeering and sex trafficking, he was found guilty on two counts related to prostitution, reports AP.Judge Arun Subramanian on Monday rejected Combs' $50 million bond request, ruling that the music mogul failed to demonstrate he was neither a flight risk nor a danger.The judge also noted that Combs had not shown any “exceptional circumstance” that would justify release after a conviction that normally requires detention. Combs will remain in custody and will not be allowed to return home while awaiting sentencing.The conviction could result in a prison sentence of up to 10 years. However, sentencing will be guided by complex federal guidelines, on which there is significant disagreement between prosecutors and Combs’ legal team, reported AP.The judge wrote that Combs’ argument “might have traction in a case that didn’t involve evidence of violence, coercion or subjugation in connection with the acts of prostitution at issue, but the record here contains evidence of all three.”During the trial, four women testified against Combs that he had physically assaulted or sexually abused them.","Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' legal team has contacted the Trump administration to explore the possibility of a presidential pardon.

TOI correspondent from Washington:





Punitive secondary tariffs on India is a warning shot aimed at China, which could also face similar tariffs US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday, amid indications that New Delhi is becoming collateral damage in a great power fracas.Asked at a White House event why New Delhi is being singled out for secondary tariffs when China is buying more Russian oil than India does, Trump interrupted the questioner twice to say ""It's okay...it's okay"" before warning there will be more secondary sanctions against countries buying Russian oil and gas.""It's only been eight hours (since he announced secondary tariffs on India) so let's see what happens...you're going to see a lot more. You're going to see so much secondary sanctions,"" he said.Asked another time if China could face similar penalties for buying Russian oil ""It may happen. I don't know, I can't tell you yet. But we did it with India. We are doing it probably with a couple of others, one of them could be China.""Trump's feckless approach towards China has been called out by several commentators, including allies like Steve Bannon, even as the MAGA Supremo had turned on Russia even though it wasn't too long ago that he was taunted as ""Putin Puppet.""The pussyfooting on Beijing appears to be on account of the realisation that it is China that holds the aces rather than US.Trump himself acknowledged that India is the second largest buyer of Russian oil behind China (""They're very close to China in terms of the purchase of oil from Russia""), but he indicated that the shock delivered to India, a country he has frequently referred to as a ""friend,"" may have have jolted Russia and China to resume talks with Washington.""I don't know if that had anything to do with it, but we've had very productive talks today,"" he said, referring to his envoy Steve Witkoff's parleys in Moscow.Trump also confirmed that the Witkoff visit had set the stage for his meeting with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in the next few days, although he was chary about the outcome of the summit because he had been disappointed before. The date and place of the meeting has not yet been confirmed.Trump's remarks left the impression that he was using punitive tariffs on India as a warning to China and Russia in an effort to sunder their energy ties and bring the war on Ukraine to an end. While secondary tariffs on India are set to kick in on August 27, a US trade delegation is scheduled to visit India days before that.","Punitive secondary tariffs on India is a warning shot aimed at China, US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday.

Pakistan political standoff deepens as PTI marks Imran’s two years in jail,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-political-standoff-deepens-as-pti-marks-imrans-two-years-in-jail/articleshow/123125854.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: Two years after former prime minister Imran Khan was jailed, Pakistan is caught in a dangerous political deadlock. Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) marked the anniversary with nationwide protests on Tuesday, confronting an increasingly dominant military establishment led by Field Marshal Asim Munir.Demonstrators took to the streets in Lahore, Karachi, Peshawar, and other cities, demanding Khan’s release from Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail, where he has been held since Aug 2023 on charges ranging from corruption to incitement. PTI called the protests a “do-or-die” moment for democracy. In response, police in Punjab and other regions launched a crackdown, detaining dozens of workers and raiding party politicians’ homes, a move Punjab police denied, though sources confirmed at least 20 arrests in Lahore.The crackdown follows sweeping convictions last week, when an anti-terrorism court in Faisalabad sentenced 108 PTI members, including opposition politicians Omar Ayub, Shibli Faraz, and Zartaj Gul Wazir, to 10 years in jail over the May 9, 2023 riots in which military installations were attacked following Khan’s brief arrest. Additional convictions were also handed down by another Punjab court, signalling what critics say is a coordinated effort to decapitate the party.PTI chairman Gohar Ali Khan denounced the rulings as “engineered”, timed to sabotage the protests. “These are not trials, they’re political purges,” he said.Khan, speaking through his X account, has accused the military of rigging the 2024 elections and enforcing what he called “Asim Law” — de facto military rule propped up by Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). The bitter personal feud between Khan and Munir dates back to 2019, when Khan, then PM, removed Munir as ISI chief, a humiliation the now army chief has apparently not forgotten.Since Munir’s appointment in 2022, the military has tightened its grip on civilian institutions. In June, Munir was controversially promoted to field marshal, Pakistan’s first since Ayub Khan, drawing criticism as a face-saving move after recent strategic and political setbacks. The military’s power has been further entrenched by a May 2025 Supreme Court ruling allowing civilian trials in military courts, and the passage of the 26th Amendment, which PTI says undermines judicial independence.The PTI’s cause has found support overseas, where diaspora communities have launched sustained protest campaigns in cities like London, Toronto, and Houston. Demonstrators have condemned what they call “military rule in civilian clothing”, using social media and digital billboards to amplify their message. While their efforts have gained some attention from rights groups and sympathetic lawmakers, they have yet to translate into meaningful international pressure on Islamabad.Back home, the govt defends the crackdown as a lawful response to what it sees as attempts to destabilise the state. But human rights groups, including Amnesty International, accuse authorities of using “unlawful and excessive force”, including arbitrary arrests, internet shutdowns, and blanket bans on public gatherings.Pakistan’s escalating political crisis is no longer just about Imran Khan. It is a contest for power, legitimacy, and the future of democratic space in the country.","Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) marked the anniversary with nationwide protests on Tuesday.

In a symbolic assertion of strategic alignment, Pakistan’s military hosted on Friday a grand ceremony at General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi to mark the 98th anniversary of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA), showcasing its deepening defence partnership with Beijing.The event came soon after a surprise 19% tariff on Pakistani imports announced by US President Donald Trump just days after Washington and Islamabad concluded new trade deals.While the tariff decision is believed to have been discussed between the two sides as part of broader trade negotiations, Trump’s typically blunt commentary on social media appeared aimed more at India than Pakistan. In recent days, Trump has taken jabs at New Delhi over its continued purchase of Russian oil and defence equipment, while casting Pakistan in a more favourable light.At GHQ, however, Pakistan’s military made its strategic loyalties unambiguous. Army Chief Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir hosted Chinese ambassador Jiang Zaidong and PLA defence attaché Maj Gen Wang Zhong at a ceremony that included military tributes, visuals of joint defence hardware, and strong political messaging. Munir described the Pakistan-China relationship as a “beacon of mutual trust and shared destiny” and referred to the PLA and Pakistan Army as “iron brothers”.The messaging was clear: Pakistan is reaffirming its long-standing alignment with China even as it navigates transactional ties with Washington and economic turbulence at home. With IMF conditionalities tightening and Western funding streams growing unpredictable, Islamabad continues to anchor itself in Beijing’s strategic orbit, particularly through projects under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).For China, the event was a diplomatic win. As Beijing faces intensifying rivalry with the US across the Indo-Pacific, its deepening influence over a nuclear-armed ally in South Asia reinforces its foothold in the region. The GHQ ceremony was a visual and political endorsement of China’s role as Islamabad’s primary defence and development partner.With Pakistan and China enhancing defence cooperation and projecting unity, New Delhi faces a more tightly aligned northern bloc just as it expands its own security ties with the US and with Indo-Pacific allies.Despite the potential economic fallout of the US tariffs, Rawalpindi appears undeterred. In an era of fluid alliances, Pakistan is betting on consistency with Beijing over the unpredictability of Western partners, a gamble that could reshape the regional balance in the years ahead.",Pakistan's military hosted a grand ceremony to mark the 98th anniversary of China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) The event came soon after a surprise 19% tariff on Pakistani imports announced by US President Donald Trump.

A Pakistani anti-terrorism court on Thursday sentenced more than 100 members of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan 's party to prison terms on charges related to riots that targeted military sites in 2023, a court order said.Fifty-eight of the defendants, who included parliamentarians and senior officials, were sentenced to 10 years in prison and the rest were given sentences ranging from one to three years, the court said.The accused include Omar Ayub Khan and Shibli Faraz, the leaders of Khan's opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party (PTI) in the lower and upper houses of parliament respectively, the court order seen by Reuters read.""The prosecution has proved its case against the accused without a shadow of doubt,"" it said in announcing the sentences.Khan, who has been in prison since 2023 facing charges of corruption, land fraud and disclosure of official secrets, is being tried separately on similar charges related to the riot.The government accuses him and other leaders of inciting the May 9, 2023, protests, during which demonstrators attacked military and government buildings, including the army headquarters in Rawalpindi.He denies wrongdoing and says all the cases are politically motivated as part of a military-backed crackdown to dismantle his party. The military denies it.Khan's arrest had prompted the countrywide violent protests.Thursday's ruling does not directly affect the incitement case against him in which prosecution is still presenting witnesses.The PTI party said it will challenge the verdict.The ruling is the third such mass conviction this month; Khan's party says they have included at least 14 of its parliamentarians.They will lose their seats in parliament under Pakistani laws, which will shred Khan's opposition party's strength.Another 77 were acquitted for lack of evidence in the latest verdict, which is linked to an attack on the office of an intelligence agency in eastern city of Faisalabad, the court said.The party plans new protests starting on August 5, the second anniversary of Khan's jailing, to demand his release.","Fifty-eight of the defendants, who included parliamentarians and senior officials, were sentenced to 10 years in prison.

"Glacial bursts, cloudbursts kill 293 in Pakistan; another monsoon spell looms",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/glacial-bursts-cloudbursts-kill-293-in-pakistan-another-monsoon-spell-looms/articleshow/122983132.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: At least 293 people have died and over 600 have been injured across Pakistan since late June as glacial lake outbursts, cloudbursts, and relentless monsoon rains triggered catastrophic floods across the country, from the Himalayas to the southern plains.The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has warned of another severe monsoon spell starting July 29, raising fears of fresh flash floods and landslides, especially in northern regions like Swat, Chitral, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Torrential rains have wreaked havoc across the country, sweeping away entire families, burying homes under landslides, and cutting off remote valleys. A sudden cloudburst near Babusar Top and Naran stranded scores of tourists, prompting military-led rescue operations by air and road. Washed-away bridges and blocked highways have hampered relief efforts.The NDMA, provincial agencies, and army teams are on the ground, but operations remain slow and patchy, especially in the hard-to-reach northern areas. Helicopter sorties continue, though poor weather and visibility are disrupting missions.Experts blame successive govts for ignoring climate adaptation and disaster preparedness, despite warnings. “The pattern is repeating itself — glacial melts, erratic monsoons, unprepared institutions. It’s a deadly mix,” said a disaster risk analyst in Islamabad.The crisis echoes the devastating 2022 monsoon floods, which killed over 1,700, submerged a third of the country, and displaced over 30 million people, causing $30 billion in economic losses. Yet, activists say climate resilience remains absent from Pakistan’s national priorities.With more glaciers than any non-polar country, Pakistan faces an increasing frequency of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) due to rising temperatures. Add to that deforestation, poor drainage, and unregulated construction, and experts say even routine monsoons now turn deadly.As another deluge looms, govt has advised evacuations from high-risk zones and warned tourists to stay away from northern areas. But for many already stranded, the warnings have come too late.","At least 293 people have died and over 600 have been injured across Pakistan since late June.

Three Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants were killed in an encounter with Pakistani security forces in Karachi, officials confirmed on Monday.Among those killed was Zafran, who was identified as the mastermind of a November 2024 attack on two Chinese engineers in Pakistan's largest city. He carried a bounty of Rs 20 million.The operation was conducted late Sunday night in the Manghopir area by the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) and intelligence agencies, CTD official Raja Umer Khattab told. The TTP men opened fire when they saw security personnel approaching, triggering a firefight which lasted over an hour.Authorities recovered a suicide jacket, three grenades, a Kalashnikov rifle, two pistols, and a large quantity of ammunition from the site.On November 5 last year, a private security guard opened fire on two Chinese nationals at a textile mill in Karachi, injuring both before fleeing.Pakistan has witnessed a sharp increase in militant attacks—particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan—since the TTP ended its ceasefire with the federal government in late 2022.Founded in 2007, the TTP is an umbrella organisation of various extremist groups seeking to impose a strict version of Islamic law across Pakistan. It has claimed responsibility for numerous high-profile attacks, including the 2008 Marriott Hotel bombing in Islamabad, the 2009 assault on army headquarters, and multiple strikes on security installations.","Three Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants were killed in an encounter with Pakistani security forces in Karachi.

Sri Lanka: Ex-minister from Rajapaksa family arrested for alleged corruption; first from once-powerful dynasty,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/sri-lanka-ex-minister-from-rajapaksa-family-arrested-for-alleged-corruption-first-from-once-powerful-dynasty/articleshow/123143702.cms,"Shasheendra Rajapaksa





Sri Lankan authorities on Wednesday arrested former minister Shasheendra Rajapaksa, a nephew of ex-presidents Gotabaya and Mahinda Rajapaksa, over corruption charges related to misusing state land and claiming undue compensation.The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) said Shasheendra coerced officials into granting him compensation for property damage, even though the asset in question was located on state-owned land. He is also accused of misusing government land, fraudulently claiming losses, and committing corruption during the aftermath of the 2022 mass protests which forced Gotabaya to resign.This marks the first arrest of a Rajapaksa family member since the leftist government of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake took office in September 2024, pledging a crackdown on entrenched corruption.Shasheendra, son of former parliamentary speaker Chamal, the eldest Rajapaksa brother, was produced before a Colombo magistrate and remanded till August 19.The once-dominant Rajapaksa family faces mounting legal troubles. Shasheendra’s cousins Namal and Yoshitha (Mahinda’s sons) are battling money laundering charges. Basil Rajapaksa, another brother of Chamal, Mahinda and Gotabaya, and an ex-minister, is under investigation for financial misconduct.Sri Lanka is still recovering from its worst economic crisis in decades, which saw it default on $46 billion in external debt in 2022, triggering nationwide protests and a political upheaval.","Shasheendra Rajapaksa is a nephew of ex-presidents Gotabaya and Mahinda.
