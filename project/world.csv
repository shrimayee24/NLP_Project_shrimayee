PM Modi Declares Countdown For DMK Exit, Calls It A Government Of Corruption, Mafia, And Crime

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu ’s ruling party, the DMK , once again raised objections to the use of Hindi in non-Hindi regions. DMK leader and MP Kanimozhi flagged what she termed the “imposition” of Hindi after responding to a post that showed Hindi being prominently used on Chennai Park railway station signboard.Taking to social media platform X, Kanimozhi appeared to target the BJP-led Centre, which the DMK has often accused of promoting Hindi at the expense of regional languages.In her post, written in Tamil, she said, loosely translated: “It began in Kallakurichi and continues to Chennai Poonthottam. They will not stop imposing it. Nor will we cease resisting it.”The BJP-led central government and the DMK government in Tamil Nadu have long been at odds over the language issue, with chief minister MK Stalin and his party repeatedly opposing what they describe as the imposition of Hindi from the North and with the support of Centre.Language politics is expected to play a key role in shaping electoral prospects in Tamil Nadu, which is heading for assembly elections to its 234-seat legislature. Neighbouring Puducherry, a Union Territory where Tamil is an official language, is also preparing for assembly polls.",DMK leader and MP Kanimozhi flagged what she termed the ‘imposition’ of Hindi.

AR Rahman Responds to Ramayan Controversy, Calls Epic a Story of Values Beyond Religion

New Delhi: As Republic Day celebrations drew to a close with the Beating Retreat ceremony, Vijay Chowk reverberated with three of composer AR Rahman's iconic songs - Oscar-winning 'Jai ho', 'Bharat humko jaan se pyaara hai' and 'Ma tujhe salaam'.Earlier this month, when asked about his absence from Hindi-film music during an interview with BBC Asian Network, Rahman said, ""It might be a communal thing also... but it is not in my face"". He later said that intentions could be ""misundersood sometimes"" and that he was grateful to the country.While the Central Armed Police Forces band performed ""Jai Ho"", the Indian Navy band played 'Bharat humko...'.The song 'Aarambh hai prachand' from the movie Gulaal was played by the Indian Army band. Vande Mataram on its 150th anniversary and Operation Sindoor were featured prominently during the ceremony on Thursday evening, which was presided over by President Droupadi Murmu, who arrived in the ceremonial buggy. Vice-President CP Radhakrishnan, PM Narendra Modi , defence minister Rajnath Singh, Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan, and the three service chiefs were also present.The bands stood various formations that included 'Amar Jawan': a tribute to Indian Army bravehearts, 'Deva Vyuha: a battle formation referred to in Mahabharata battle formation against Bhishm Pitamah and 'Ardhachandra Vyuha': a half-moon battle formation.LED screens placed at the venue also showed a video clip of a BrahMos missile hitting a target; instruments of several band members were wrapped with LEDs on which the logo of Op Sindoor shone. Images of Rafale, Tejas, Su-30, BrahMos, S-400 air defence system, Netra, Prachand and C-130 also played on the screens.Later, the PM shared the glimpses from Beating Retreat 2026, saying that ""performances by the various bands were memorable"".In a series of posts on X, Modi said: ""Air Force Band was exceptional... They performed 'Brave Warrior', 'Twilight', 'Alert (Post Horn Gallop)' and 'Flying Star' impeccably. The Sindoor formation was brilliant!""On the naval band, he posted, ""Simply outstanding! The Naval Band's performances included 'Namaste', 'Sagar Pawan', 'Matribhumi', 'Tejasvi' and 'Jai Bharati'. The Matsya Yantra formation was flawless.""","Ar Rahman's iconic songs 'Jai ho', 'Bharat humko jaan se pyaara hai' and 'Ma tujhe salaam' played at Beating Retreat ceremony.

Sibal said that these malicious and misleading statements, which he never said and debunked by fact checkers, were relied upon. The activist was detained in Sept and he has been in custody since then.Highlighting Wangchuk has been holding protests to protect ecology and environment of Ladakh, Sibal said speaking against a govt cannot be termed as an act against the country and anti-national. ""He had said he will not allow violence to take place. The 6th schedule was a promise given by a political party. It was given in 2020. If in 2025 he says fulfil it before elections then what's wrong with it? Anti-govt sentiment is not a security threat to the country.I can criticise the govt. That's what democracy is about.

""A detaining authority relying on a statement must rely on the entire statement and cannot rely on a sentence or two...The whole detention order is based on excerpts, out of context, misleading, false, thereby suggesting a selective approach, malafide in nature, to ensure that I am detained,"" Sibal said.Referring to his alleged statement to overthrow the govt, Sibal made the bench to go through the transcript .""The correct translation is - I say if the govt does not have affection for citizens, care for its environment, then such a govt is an obstacle in the progress of the nation. He says I too can bring change. We all need to be prepared to save mother Ladakh and mother India. What is wrong in this?"" he said.On disrespecting a goddess, Sibal said, ""The unedited version brings out a complete picture. It was meant to say that after liberating Ladakh from Kashmir, the central govt failed to extend its promise of constitutional safeguards under the 6th Schedule. He says like Rama got Sita from the clutches of Ravana and left her in the market, the central govt did a similar thing with Ladakh."" He said that the activist had praised govt and Prime Minister Narendra Modi multiple times on international platforms and he never spoke against the country.

ADGP Suspension Revoked, Chennai Triple Murder, TVK Drops Vijay And More





CHENNAI: The city police on Wednesday stumbled into a shocking triple murder while probing the mystery behind an abandoned sack containing the body of a guest worker on Jan 26. The body was found on the roadside in an upscale neighbourhood in Adyar. Now, it turns out that the guest worker Gaurav Kumar’s wife Minukumari and son Birmani Kumar too had been murdered and their bodies dumped at different locations in the vicinity.While the child’s body was recovered from the Buckingham Canal in Adyar, the woman’s body is yet to be traced. A total of five people, all natives of Bihar, have been arrested in connection with the murders.Police said Gaurav Kumar of Nalanda district in Bihar was a security guard at a private company in Sriperumbudur, for the past two years. On Jan 21, he, along with his wife Minukumari and son Birmani Kumar, returned from a trip to Bihar and moved to the city seeking a job.Through contacts in his hometown, he approached Krishna Prasad, 60, who is also from Bihar and who worked as a security guard and lived with his family in Taramani. Krishna Prasad introduced Gaurav Kumar to several acquaintances from Bihar who were employed as security guards in nearby buildings.Gaurav Kumar and his family stayed at Krishna Prasad’s house and in other residences where migrant workers from Bihar lived, while he searched for a job.On Jan 25, during a drinking session with another security guard Sikander, 33, and his four friends, a fight erupted during which Gaurav Kumar was attacked first. When Minukumari attempted to flee with her son, the gang attacked them with an iron rod. Both Minukumari and Birmani Kumar died on the spot.In order to divert police attention, Sikander and his associates wrapped Gaurav Kumar’s body in a sack and dumped it in front of a two-wheeler showroom in Indira Nagar First Avenue. Police have secured CCTV camera footage showing how two suspects transported the body on a two-wheeler, placing it between the rider and the pillion before dumping it.The child’s body was dumped amidst bushes along the Buckingham Canal near Madhya Kailash, while Minukumari’s body was wrapped in a sack and dumped in a garbage bin near the Indira Nagar MRTS station.","Gaurav Kumar of Nalanda district in Bihar was a security guard at a private company in Sriperumbudur, for the past two years.

A chilling call



'We gave them Bullet bike, gold jewellery'





NEW DELHI: A 27-year-old Delhi Police SWAT commando died after being hit by dumbbell at her home in west Delhi.According to news agency PTI, Kajal Chaudhary, who was four months pregnant, was posted with the Special Cell of Delhi Police.She was at her residence in Mohan Garden on January 22 when the alleged assault took place.Her husband, Ankur, a clerk with the Ministry of Defence posted in Delhi Cantonment, was arrested hours later.Kajal succumbed to her injuries on January 27, after battling for life for five days at a hospital in Ghaziabad.Her brother, Nikhil, a constable posted at Parliament Street Police Station, told PTI that he was on the phone when the attack occurred.Also read: ‘Our son would’ve got a car’: Even after giving Bullet bike, dowry harassment continued, says family of slain SWAT commando “He told me to put the call on recording, said it could be used as police evidence; (then) told me he was killing her. And then, I heard her screams,” Nikhil recalled, describing the moments before the call ended abruptly.According to Nikhil, the sequence of events began with a call from Ankur. “He called me and said, ‘Apni behen ko samjha le’ (Make your sister understand). I asked him to calm down and immediately called my sister,” he said.“She normally wouldn’t tell us much about what was happening, but that day she was sharing her ordeal. While we were speaking, he got angry that she was telling me things and snatched the phone from her,” Nikhil said.Also read: 'Ye mar gayi hai hospital aajao’: Kin recall final call from Delhi Police SWAT commando Kajal Chaudhary's husband “Then he said to me, ‘Is call ko recording pe rakh, police evidence me kaam aayega. Main maar raha hoon teri behen ko. Police mera kuch nahi kar payegi’ (Put this call on recording, it will be useful as police evidence. I am killing your sister. Police won’t be able to do anything). Then I heard her screams. The call ended abruptly,” he said.Barely five minutes later, Nikhil said he received another call. “He (Ankur) said, ‘Ye mar gayi hai. Hospital aajao’ (She is dead. Come to the hospital). We rushed there with police personnel. He and his family were already present. When I saw my sister not even an enemy kills someone like this,” he said.The family alleged that Kajal sustained severe head injuries and had multiple wounds across her body. Nikhil said they attempted to admit her to several hospitals but were allegedly told her chances of survival were minimal before she was finally admitted to a Ghaziabad hospital.The family has accused Ankur and his relatives of prolonged torture and dowry harassment, including during Kajal’s pregnancy.The couple has a one-and-a-half-year-old son, who is currently with his maternal grandparents.Recalling an earlier incident, Nikhil said Kajal had been slapped by her husband around five months ago.“I went there and asked her to come with me. Ankur apologised and swore on his child that he wouldn’t repeat it. I told my sister she could return home whenever she wanted and didn’t have to stay there,” he said.He also alleged that Kajal was made to do household chores despite being pregnant. “She would cook, wash clothes and utensils despite being pregnant,” he claimed.“Her son doesn’t know anything about the incident, and we have decided that we will only raise him. We will tell him when he is mature to understand such things,” Nikhil told PTI.Kajal’s father, Rakesh, alleged persistent dowry demands.“We gave them a Bullet bike, gold jewellery and cash at the wedding, but they said our son would have got a car (had he married someone else). Later, my daughter even arranged a car, but they didn't stop harassing her. We couldn't even speak freely to her,” he said.Her mother said the family had spent around Rs 20 lakh on the marriage and taken loans. “He (Ankur) had also taken Rs 5 lakh from her. She (Kajal) suffered a lot. I want justice. He is a monster,” she said.The couple had known each other since their college days in Panipat and married on November 23, 2023.Due to frequent disputes at their native home in Ganaur, Haryana, they shifted to a rented accommodation in Mohan Garden in December 2024, but tensions reportedly continued.Police said financial stress and domestic disputes were among the factors behind the conflict. “The couple had taken some loans and often had arguments over finances and household expenses,” a Delhi Police officer said.“On January 22, Ankur allegedly first banged Kajal’s head against a door frame before attacking her with a dumbbell,” the officer added.A case was registered at Mohan Garden police station based on Nikhil’s complaint. “He was initially booked for attempt to murder. After her death, the charges will be converted to murder,” the officer said.","Kajal Chaudhary, a 27-year-old Delhi Police SWAT commando died after being hit by dumbbell at her home in west Delhi.

NCP in Catch-22: Ajit Pawar's 'last wish' and Mahayuti alliance; calls for Sunetra to step in,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ncp-in-catch-22-ajit-pawars-last-wish-and-mahayuti-alliance-calls-for-sunetra-to-step-in/articleshow/127780212.cms,"Will the party merge with the rival faction of Sharad Pawar?

Will the united NCP stay in Mahayuti?

to replace Ajit Pawar in Maharashtra cabinet?

Who will lead the party?

NEW DELHI: The sudden death of Ajit Pawar has left his party, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), with many challenges. After losing its most skilful political manager, the party is now in a Catch-22 situation over a possible merger with the rival faction, while also keeping the alliance with the BJP intact.As “Ajit Dada” was cremated in Baramati on Thursday after a tragic plane crash, four questions are staring straight at the party.Amid the ongoing speculations, the Pawar family has to take a call over the merger of the party, which underwent a split in 2023. According to senior NCP leader and a minister in the Fadnavis cabinet, Narhari Zirwal said that the “two factions are already together”, claiming that there was “no point in remaining scattered.”“The two factions are already together (for local body polls). Everyone has realised that there is no point in remaining scattered and we have to be together,"" Zirwal said.Meanwhile, state NCP (Sharad Pawar) president Shashikant Shinde told news agency PTI that Ajit Pawar, before his death, Ajit had spoke about sitting together and taking a decision on the merger of the two NCPs after municipal and local body polls in Maharashtra.“When we had met for an alliance of the two parties for Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad corporation elections (which took place on January 15), he (Ajit) had said let’s sit together and discuss (merger) after Zilla Parishad and Panchayat Samiti polls (scheduled on February 5),” he said.“Ajit Dada (elder brother) was an emotional man and wanted the two factions to come together and the (Pawar) family to remain united. He had felt enough was enough. If the family and parties want a reconciliation, we have no problem. Now, we have to see if we can fulfil what became his last wish,” he added.This comes after both the factions contested the local body polls in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad together.However, the united Nationalist Congress Party suffered a massive setback in Pimpri-Chinchwad and Pune municipal elections. In the 165-member Pune Municipal Corporation, the NCP won only 27 seats and NCP (SP) three seats against the BJP’s tally of 119, whereas in the 102-member Pimpri-Chinchwad civic body, Ajit Pawar’s party got 37 and Sharad Pawar’s faction drew a blank, while the BJP got 84 seats.In 2023, Ajit Pawar, along with a group of senior leaders, parted ways with Sharad Pawar and joined hands with the BJP and Eknath Shinde’s Shiv Sena. He had raised objections over Sharad Pawar continuing to lead the party, despite his old age.Ajit was sworn in as deputy chief minister under this new alliance. The Election Commission later recognised Ajit’s faction as the legitimate NCP, retaining the ‘clock’ symbol.After the merger, the united NCP will also have to take a call on whether to continue to stay in the Mahayuti alliance or step out and join the opposition.According to political analysts, if NCP (SP)’s working president Supriya Sule takes a call to join the opposition, several NCP MLAs could oppose the move and switch to Shiv Sena or the BJP.However, if the party decides to stay in the alliance with the BJP and Shiv Sena, those with Sharad Pawar’s group in the opposition will not want their group to compromise on Phule-Ambedkar-Shahu’s ideology.NCP leaders are also pushing Sunetra Pawar — wife of Ajit Pawar — as his replacement in the Fadnavis cabinet. Narhari Zirwal said it is the people’s wish that late Ajit Pawar’s wife Sunetra, a Rajya Sabha member, be inducted into the state ministry.Asked about the NCP’s future after the untimely death of Ajit Pawar, who was also the party president, Zirwal said that people want “vahini” (sister-in-law, referring to Sunetra Pawar) to be made a cabinet member.“We will talk to our leadership about it (inducting Sunetra in the cabinet) and take a decision,” Zirwal, a close confidante of Ajit Pawar, said.Given that Sunetra hasn’t been politically active despite being a Rajya Sabha MP, it will be interesting to see whether she will be allotted a seat in the Maharashtra cabinet. And even if she is given a seat in the cabinet, will she be made deputy chief minister or finance minister of the state — the posts Ajit Pawar held?In a situation where the merger plan fails, another question arises over who will become the president of the party. While former Union minister and party working president Praful Patel and state unit chief Sunil Tatkare are likely contenders, the Pawars would be reluctant to let someone from outside the family lead the party.Another NCP leader and Ajit Pawar confidante, Pramod Hindurao, maintained that Sunetra Pawar should carry forward the legacy of her husband and take care of party workers.“Considering the sympathy factor, Sunetra can be the option to not only lead the party but also negotiate merger talks with the other group, who are also part of her family,” political analyst Prakash Pawar told TOI.","Ajit Pawar's sudden death has left his party, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), with many challenges.

NEW DELHI: Actor-politician Vijay's father SA Chandrasekhar has appealed to the Congress to forge an electoral alliance with his son's Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) for the upcoming Tamil Nadu assembly election, claiming it could help the grand old party regain its ""old glory"" in the state.

How can he even pronounce the word greater Assam when his own children are not Assamese?"" Sarma said.The BJP leader has been continuously criticising the Assam Congress president over the citizenship of Gogoi's wife and two children, saying that three out of four in the family are British citizens.Carrying on with the tirade, Sarma said, ""Who will live in his (Gogoi's) greater Assam? Only the Miyas will live. That is why nobody should pay any attention to this man's statements and I don't think we should discuss him seriously.""'Miya' is originally a pejorative term used for Bengali-speaking Muslims in Assam and the non-Bengali speaking people generally identify them as Bangladeshi immigrants. In recent years, activists from the community have started adopting this term as a gesture of defiance.""Gaurav Gogoi would not be able to tell the names of the constituencies from Tinsukia to Golaghat. The Upper Assam as we understand, there are not 50 seats,"" Sarma said while reacting to the Congress leader's claim that the opposition will win 50 seats in the coming assembly polls.The Assam assembly elections to 126 constituencies are likely to take place in March-April this year.Asked about Gogoi's criticism of Sarma as ""Hindu Jinnah"", the CM said, ""Jinnah is from Pakistan. Why does he bring in items from Pakistan, he could have given examples from other places also. There are people in India too. I cannot comment on an example from Pakistan as I have never visited that country.""The Assam CM and the BJP have been attacking Gogoi over his wife's alleged connection with Pakistan's spy agency ISI. They even claim that the Congress leader has ""direct links"" with the neighbouring nation.Talking about the upcoming assembly elections, Sarma said: ""I don't think the opposition or Congress have any stand on any issue. Only one community supports Congress. I don't think the opposition will have any specific impact this time.""""I have so far attended 80 meetings. I can understand the people's pulse. This time, the Congress will have a very bad situation,"" he added.Sarma also criticised leader of the opposition Debabrata Saikia and Raijor Dal MLA Akhil Gogoi, and said that they will have no influence during the forthcoming polls.",Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma on Wednesday alleged that Congress leader Gaurav Gogoi does not have any responsibility towards the state. Sarma also asserted that the opposition has no stand on any issue ahead of the Assembly elections.

Ajit Pawar Dead In Barimati Crash: Eyewitness Details Explosions; PM Reacts, Nation Stunned

Maharashtra on Thursday held the last rites of Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar amid chants of “Ajit Dada Amar Rahe” at Baramati. The 66-year-old NCP chief was cremated with full state honours at the Vidya Pratishthan college ground.Pawar died a day earlier, along with four others, when the chartered aircraft carrying them crashed on Wednesday.The college where the cremation was held was founded by the Pawar family.His mortal remains, draped in the national flag, were taken from his native Katewadi to the Vidya Pratishthan ground, about 100 km from Pune.His cousin Supriya Sule, the NCP (SP) Lok Sabha member from Baramati, stood with Pawar’s wife Sunetra Pawar, a Rajya Sabha member, offering support as she paid tributes to her late husband.As large numbers gathered to pay their respects, Pawar’s sons, Parth and Jay, lit the funeral pyre.Union Home Minister Amit Shah, BJP president Nitin Nabin and Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis were present.Union minister Nitin Gadkari and Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar were among those who attended the ceremony to pay their respects, along with actor Riteish Deshmukh and leaders from across the political spectrum.Union minister Ramdas Athawale, Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant, Maharashtra Deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde, assembly speaker Rahul Narwekar, former union minister Sushilkumar Shinde and Andhra Pradesh minister Nara Lokesh placed floral wreaths on Pawar’s mortal remains.Family members, including Ajit Pawar’s younger brother Shriniwas Pawar, his sisters, and cousin Abhijit Pawar, also paid tributes. Former chief minister Ashok Chavan, Maharashtra Congress president Harshwardhan Sapkal, and party leader Manikrao Thakare were present as well.Earlier in the day, Shiv Sena (UBT) chief and former chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and MNS president Raj Thackeray offered floral tributes at Ajit Pawar’s residence in Katewadi.On Thursday morning, the mortal remains of Ajit Pawar were taken from Punyashlok Ahilyadevi Hospital in Baramati, where they had been kept overnight, to his native village.Pawar and four others were killed when the aircraft they were travelling in crashed about 200 metres from the edge of a tabletop airstrip. The victims included Captain Sumit Kapoor, co-pilot Shambhavi Pathak, personal security officer Vidip Jadhav and flight attendant Pinky Mali. Their bodies have been handed over to their families.Police have registered an accidental death report in the case. According to a government statement, the aircraft had gone around due to poor visibility and was later cleared to land, but failed to respond to air traffic control before bursting into flames near the airstrip.Civil aviation minister Rammohan Naidu Kinjarapu on Thursday informed Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis that the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau has launched a formal probe into the accident. He said the investigation would be carried out transparently and within a stipulated timeframe.","Ajit Pawar was cremated with full state honours at the Vidya Pratishthan college ground.

NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Thursday refused to walk back from his remarks on ""Miya Muslims"" after the criticism by the opposition.A day after the chief minister said that he encourages troubling the ""Miyan"" to drive them back from the state, Sarma clarified that the word was used to refer the illegal Muslim migrants from Bangladesh. He also cited the Supreme Court to claim that the issue is a ""grave and long-standing problem that Assam has lived with for decades.""In a social media post on X, Sarma said, ""Those who are attacking me for my remarks on “Miyan”—a word used in Assam in the context of Bangladeshi Muslim illegal migration—should pause and read what the Supreme Court of India itself has said about Assam. This is not my language, not my imagination, and not political exaggeration.""“The silent and invidious demographic invasion of Assam may result in the loss of the geostrategically vital districts of lower Assam… The influx of illegal migrants is turning these districts into a Muslim majority region… It will then only be a matter of time when a demand for their merger with Bangladesh may be made… Loss of lower Assam will sever the entire land mass of the North East from the rest of India and the rich natural resources of that region will be lost to the Nation,"" Himanta cited a Supreme Court observation.""Our effort is not against any religion or any Indian citizen. Our effort is to protect Assam’s identity, security, and future, exactly as the Supreme Court cautioned the nation to do. Ignoring that warning would be the real injustice—to Assam and to India,"" he added.Earlier on Wednesday, Himanta had said that he encourages creating “trouble” for “Miyan Muslims” so that they are driven out of the state, remarks that have sparked widespread outrage across the election-bound northeastern state.“Trouble the Miyan Muslims by any means. If they face trouble, they will go from Assam. If I want to give trouble to Miya, I go at 12 am. It’s not an issue. We are directly against the Miya Muslims,"" Himanta had said.""We are not hiding anything; we directly say that we are against Miyans. Earlier, people feared that notices would be served against them. Now, I encourage everyone to give trouble to Miyan. Yesterday, I saw that they have reached Duliajan. A tsunami will happen here, but the result will be in Pakistan,” he added.His remarks drew strong criticism from Opposition leaders, who warned that such statements could have serious consequences for social harmony.Congress leader Udit Raj said the Assam chief minister’s remarks would not go down well with the public and could even lead to “civil war”.“Congress neither works for Bengali Muslims nor for Bengali Hindus. Congress views everyone as a citizen. It is good that what was once done covertly, Himanta Biswa Sarma has now openly stated,' the Congress leader told news agency IANS.CPI(M) MP Amraram also condemned the comments, accusing the Assam government of using administrative exercises to marginalise vulnerable communities.""This is what the chief minister always does. In the name of SIR, votes are being taken away from Dalits, minorities, SCs, and STs. Even when people are not being divided on the basis of Hindu or Muslim, votes are being manipulated in the name of SIR. All of these people are citizens of this country, whether Muslim, Hindu, Sikh, Christian, or Buddhist.

West Bengal SIR Brings Home A Man Presumed Dead For 28 Years In UP’s Muzaffarnagar

New Delhi: RJD MP Manoj Jha on Wednesday told the Supreme Court that the Election Commission has no power to classify voters as non-citizens or to delete them from electoral rolls as it can only flag people with doubtful citizenship to the Union govt, which alone can decide citizenship disputes.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Jha, told a bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi that EC cannot strike off names of voters from electoral roll by terming their citizenship doubtful and deprive them of their valuable democratic right to choose their representative.Reiterating a point that he has made in almost every case that touched upon elections be it EVMs or constitutional amendments, Sibal said, “The judgment that the court will render in this case will be no ordinary one, for it will decide the future of democracy of India.”Sprinkling his criticism of SIR and the alleged opaque process adopted by EC with repeated refrains of “not fair”, Sibal said once the EC flags a doubtful citizenship case to the Centre, it must not remove the voter’s name from electoral roll till the govt decided the dispute over citizenship.Justice Bagchi said once an objection to a person’s citizenship is raised before the Electoral Registration Officer (ERO), she will seek documentary proof and hear parties to decide the citizenship dispute.How can ERO decide who is an illegal migrant, Sibal asked, adding that crores of voters are being deleted on flimsy grounds.CJI Kant-led bench said a hue and cry was raised over deletion of 65 lakh names from Bihar voters list. Did a single person file an appeal, it asked and said the initial apprehensions about large-scale deletion did not come true. He said the EC has not given a single reason why it is conducting pan-India SIR, as is required under the mandate to EC for carrying out special revision of electoral rolls. Why is such an exercise required to be done near the elections, EC has no answer, he said.Social activist Yogendra Yadav said wherever SIR was conducted, the ratio of female voters has declined. The large-scale deletion of women voters is because of the technically faulty SIR, he said, adding that because only special revision was carried out in Assam the ratio of women voters increased.A tired bench of CJI Kant and Justice Bagchi, which has been hearing arguments on petitions challenging the constitutional validity of SIR spread over the past three months, told the petitioners’ counsel to conclude their arguments in 45 minutes on Thursday.","RJD MP Manoj Jha told the Supreme Court that the Election Commission has no power to classify voters as non-citizens.

What led to Aspen Kartier’s twitch ban







Aspen Kartier, a Twitch streamer, has been banned from Twitch after a disturbing video from one of her streams went viral on social media. The video caused an uproar on social media, with many people accusing the streamer of animal cruelty. Although Twitch has not issued an official statement, the ban came after the streamer received heavy criticism online.The incident occurred during one of her streams on January 28. Although the dog was not shown in the video, the audio from the stream caused concern among her fans. The video was later shared on Reddit and other social media platforms.During the livestream, audio captures Aspen Kartier asking her dog how it escaped from its cage. Moments later, repeated yelping can be heard, which many viewers believe lines up with the streamer striking the animal multiple times. The sounds triggered immediate concern, with viewers saying the audio suggested the dog was in distress.At the end of the clip, Aspen Kartier is seen carrying the dog out of the room by its scruff. While the animal is never shown on camera, the audio alone was enough to alarm many viewers.The clip was described as disturbing, and many users said it was too graphic to be reshared in full.Not long after the video went viral on the internet, Aspen Kartier was banned from the platform Twitch. Aspen Kartier is not only a streamer but also a rapper who recently transitioned into content creation. Before the ban, she had more than 70,000 followers on Twitch and over 100,000 subscribers on YouTube, where she posts a mix of livestreams and recorded videos. The incident has now cast a shadow over her online career.In the aftermath, many commenters expressed shock and anger, while others debated whether Twitch acted quickly enough. The situation has once again raised questions about streamer behavior, platform responsibility, and how live content is moderated.For now, Aspen Kartier remains banned from Twitch, and it is unclear whether she plans to respond publicly or appeal the decision.","Aspen Kartier, a Twitch streamer, has been banned from the platform after a disturbing video from one of her streams went viral on social media.

Read Apple CEO Tim Cook’s memo to employees

Team,

I’m heartbroken by the events in Minneapolis, and my prayers and deepest sympathies are with the families, with the communities, and with everyone that’s been affected.

This is a time for deescalation. I believe America is strongest when we live up to our highest ideals, when we treat everyone with dignity and respect no matter who they are or where they’re from, and when we embrace our shared humanity.

This is something Apple has always advocated for. I had a good conversation with the president this week where I shared my views, and I appreciate his openness to engaging on issues that matter to us all.

I know this is very emotional and challenging for so many. I am proud of how deeply our teams care about the world beyond our walls. That empathy is one of Apple’s greatest strengths and it is something I believe we all cherish.

Thank you for all that you do.

Tim

Apple CEO Tim Cook has broken his silence on the Minneapolis shootings, telling employees he's ""heartbroken"" that left two people dead at the hands of federal immigration agents, telling employees he's ""heartbroken"" and believes America must live up to its highest ideals. In an internal memo sent Tuesday, as obtained by Bloomberg, Cook revealed he discussed the situation with US President Trump earlier this week.The memo comes as Cook faces mounting criticism for his proximity to the Trump administration. On Saturday, just hours after ICE agents fatally shot 37-year-old Alex Pretti—an intensive care nurse at the US Department of Veterans Affairs—Cook was spotted at a VIP screening of the ""Melania"" documentary at the White House.""This is a time for de-escalation,"" Cook wrote in Tuesday's message to staff.

""I appreciate his openness to engaging on issues that matter to us all,"" he added.The Apple chief has maintained close ties with the Trump administration since the president's re-election, becoming a regular fixture at White House events and policy briefings. Trump has frequently praised Cook in public speeches.Minneapolis has become a flashpoint for immigration enforcement tensions. Pretti's killing on Saturday followed another fatal ICE shooting on January 7, when agents killed 37-year-old poet Renée Good in the same city. Cook acknowledged the emotional toll on his workforce, praising their empathy as ""one of Apple's greatest strengths.""","Apple CEO Tim Cook has broken his silence on the Minneapolis shootings, telling employees he's ""heartbroken"" In an internal memo sent Tuesday, Cook revealed he discussed the situation with US President Trump earlier this week.

BHUBANESWAR: A splash of flaming red hair has put an Odisha police officer in the crosshairs of his bosses. DSP Rashmi Ranjan Das, 49, known as a scourge of the underworld, has been ordered to immediately ditch his flamboyant hair colour after photographs of him in uniform went viral and triggered a storm of memes, mockery and debate online.Das is posted in Jagatsinghpur district, about 60km east of Bhubaneswar. The red hair, which he has been sporting for some time, drew sudden attention Wednesday when images spread rapidly across social media platforms.By Thursday, police headquarters stepped in. IG (central range) Satyajit Naik issued a formal warning, directing Das to revert to his natural hair. ""One in the police force should respect the uniform and accord utmost priority to discipline and public decorum,"" Naik said, adding he acted as soon as the matter came to his notice.Online critics were unforgiving. One widely shared post asked whether such ""an awful hair colour and look"" suited a uniformed officer. ""One can gauge this officer's professionalism ... from his hair colour,"" it said. Others said a flashy appearance diluted the authority and seriousness the uniform represents.On the ground in Jagatsinghpur, opinion split sharply. Residents defended the officer's record. ""He is a terror for criminals,"" said Prabodh Pradhan, a resident.""Someone's efficiency should not be judged from his or her hairstyle."" Police sources said Das, now posted with the human rights protection cell, had ignored informal advice to tone it down. ""We often advised him to dye his hair black, which is acceptable and appropriate. But he ignored our advice,"" a colleague said.Retired cop SN Swain said the police manual does not spell out hairstyles, but expects simplicity. Das declined comments. The message from the top was unmistakable: in khaki, there is little tolerance for a hair out of place.","DSP Rashmi Ranjan Das, 49, known as a scourge of the underworld, has been ordered to immediately ditch his flamboyant hair colour.

BATHINDA: Residents of a village in Punjab's Muktsar district made a chilling discovery when the water in a nullah receded on Thursday — two foetuses, one with the placenta attached, lying on the muddy canal bed.Police and health officials rushed to Rupana village, barely 10km from Mukstar Sahib and around 160km west of Ludhiana, as soon as the disturbing news got out.The foetuses were taken to Muktsar civil hospital, Sadar police station inquiry officer Hakam Singh said. It is not yet known if these foetuses were born of the same mother or were thrown into the waterbody by different people.Muktsar SMO Dr Rajiv Sachdeva said initially villagers and police felt that these were three foetuses because the placenta had not been removed from one. They will be preserved in a mortuary for 72 hours and a postmortem examination will be conducted, he said. Sources said both foetuses seem to be 2-3 months old.The district family planning officer has been asked to collect details about pregnancies and childbirths in the area to try and identify the mother/s. Police suspect the deliveries were conducted by quacks or ‘dais' and teams are out interviewing such people.","Residents of a village in Punjab's Muktsar district made a chilling discovery when the water in a nullah receded on Thursday.

Bengaluru International Film Festival begins; Prakash Raj asks govt to allow screening of Palestinian films,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/prakash-raj-asks-karnataka-government-to-allow-screening-of-palestinian-films-at-biffes/articleshow/127783781.cms,"Bengaluru International Film Festival commenced with actor Prakash Raj criticizing the state government's stance on stalling Palestinian film screenings

FIR Against Ranveer Singh, Drug Peddlers Arrested, Forgotten Flavours Contest And More





BENGALURU: The 17th edition of Bengaluru International Film Festival (BIFFes) started on a stormy note Thursday with actor Prakash Raj questioning the state govt's move to stall screening of Palestinian movies.Prakash Raj, who is the brand ambassador of this year's BIFFes, recited a short excerpt from The War Will End, a poem written by Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish. Reflecting on his earlier association with the festival, Prakash Raj said, ""I came here 16 years ago. Today, I see a lot more political intervention in film festivals, and Palestinian movies are now being stalled.""Several Palestinian films are currently awaiting clearance from Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), resulting in their screening being put on hold.Referring to a recent incident at the International Literature Festival of Kerala, where Palestinian films were initially barred, Prakash Raj said the Kerala govt had taken a strong stand against the ban. ""The govt there ensured the films were screened. I want Karnataka govt to do the same. I request, and also demand, that the state govt protest against such bans and take a firm stand in support of screening these films,"" he said.Chief minister Siddaramaiah, however, did not directly respond to the issue of Palestinian films in his address. Instead, he spoke about the role of cinema in society: ""Films are not merely for entertainment. They are a medium to reflect social realities, communities, injustices and differences. Film festivals help us understand cultures, lifestyles, politics and the land through cinema, and allow us to compare our society with others. ""Shivajinagar MLA Rizwan Arshad, referring to Siddaramaiah, said: ""Our CM is not afraid to express his stand, no matter the pressure. We are not scared of anyone when it comes to standing up for what we believe,"" he said.BIFFes is screening 60 movies directed by women, 300-plus films from different countries and over 100 which have won awards in festivals across the globe.The festival is from Jan 30 to Feb 6 at Cinepolis in Lulu Mall near Majestic, Suchitra Film Society in Banashankari and Kannada Film Artistes' Association near Makkala Koota in Chamarajpet.","17th edition of Bengaluru International Film Festival (BIFFes) started on a stormy note Thursday.

The attack occurred after they spoke their native language. One brother sustained head injuries and a fractured shoulder.

(With inputs from Naseer Ganai in Srinagar)





DEHRADUN: Objecting to two teen shawl hawkers -- a 17-year-old boy and his brother, 18 -- from Kashmir's Kupwara speaking in their native language in Uttarakhand, a shopkeeper along with three others, including a woman, in Dehradun on Wednesday allegedly passed communal remarks and then brutally assaulted them with rods and canes, leaving the younger sibling with a head injury and a fractured shoulder.J&K CM Omar Abdullah on Thursday took up the ""assault"" case with Uttarakhand CM Pushkar Singh Dhami urging him to take strict action against perpetrators. The main accused was arrested later in the day, as per police.Narrating the horrific incident, Mohammed Danish, the elder sibling, said, ""Calling it a day, we went to a grocery shop to buy some snacks in the evening. After paying the amount, we left the place while chatting in Kashmiri. Then, suddenly, a shopkeeper came out and asked for our names and our native place. To our shock, he started abusing us when he learnt that we were Kashmiri Muslims, and said, ‘You people did the Pahalgam attack'"".Danish added: ""Soon after, he was joined by at least three others. They repeatedly beat us, in which (younger sibling) Mohammed Tavish suffered injuries to his head and a fracture to his left shoulder."" Witnessing the commotion and Tavish's injuries, some locals intervened and took them to a health centre.Based on the complaint (by Danish), a case was registered on Wednesday night under BNS sections 117 (2) (voluntarily causing grievous hurt) and 352 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace) against two unidentified persons. SSI Dehradun Ajai Singh said, ""Prime accused Sanjay Yadav, who was detained for questioning, has been arrested. CCTV footage is being examined and we're also speaking to witnesses. ""SSI (Vikasnagar) Shishupal Rana said the brothers were called to the local police station to record their statements. ""Based on their statements, we'll add more sections, if required. A thorough probe is on.""Danish's cousin, Mohammed Shafi, meanwhile, told TOI their family travels to HP's Paonta Sahib every winter and had arrived in Dehradun to sell shawls. ""They went to Vikasnagar area where it all happened. Tavish bled profusely from the head and was provided seven stitches. They were told, ‘This is Uttarakhand, you cannot speak Kashmiri'... Our family back home is very worried for our safety,"" said Shafi.Meanwhile, the J&K CM said Dhami assured him that the safety of J&K residents will be ensured. ""Recent attacks, including in HP, and now this one are unacceptable and must stop. It can't be claimed that J&K is an inalienable part of India while people from Kashmir, in other parts of the country, live in fear for their lives. My govt will step in where ever necessary,"" CM Omar said, adding, ""I hope the Union home ministry will sensitise other states on the issue. ""Raising the issue with Uttarakhand authorities on Thursday, Jammu and Kashmir Students' Association convenor, Nasir Khuehami, said, ""This is a chilling reminder of how communal profiling, intimidation and mob brutality are being normalised against communities trying to earn a dignified livelihood during harsh winter months.""Uttarakhand has witnessed at least three such incidents in the past two months. On Dec 24 last year, a 28-year-old Kashmiri vendor was assaulted in US Nagar district, in which three were held. On Jan 18, another vendor was allegedly assaulted in Almora. Earlier, last April, two more vendors were assaulted in Mussoorie. In the 2025 Pahalgam attack, Pak-backed terrorists targeted Hindu tourists and shot dead 25 of them along with a Kashmiri Muslim pony ride operator.Speaking on the incidents related to Kashmiris in Uttarakhand, inspector general (law and order) Sunil Kumar Meena told TOI, ""Police from headquarters have given directions to all the districts at regular intervals on the safety and security of people from Kashmir and the Northeast. We also maintain a record of them living in Uttarakhand to offer timely help, if needed.""","Two Kashmiri Muslim brothers selling shawls in Dehradun faced brutal assault.

Mumbai local train murder: Guard posted at Borivli lock-up to watch over accused in college teacher killing case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-local-train-murder-guard-posted-at-borivli-lock-up-to-watch-over-accused-in-college-teacher-killing/articleshow/127788736.cms,"



MUMBAI: The Govt Railway Police (GRP) has posted a guard at the Borivli general lock-up to watch over Omkar Shinde, the 27-year-old man arrested for the alleged murder of a college teacher inside a local train last week.Given the sensitive nature of the case, investigators said they are taking additional precautions. Shinde will be produced before a magistrate court at Borivli on Friday.Last Saturday, Shinde had a spat with Alok Kumar Singh, a teacher at the Narsee Monjee College in Vile Parle, over alighting from a local train at Malad station. Shinde allegedly stabbed Singh in the abdomen with a small pair of tongs that he was carrying in his pocket.He has alleged that he did so after being shoved and after someone in the compartment pulled his hair. He was arrested on Sunday morning at an auto stand outside Malad railway station.Police said until his arrest, Shinde was unaware of Singh’s death. “He had not watched news on TV or checked social media. Had he known that we were looking for him, he could have slipped out of Mumbai,” said a GRP officer. Police had tracked Shinde’s routine over surveillance camera footage for five days prior to the arrest.They observed that he took the 7.18am local to his workplace in south Mumbai from Malad station and returned by the 4.16pm local. Investigators were not sure if Shinde would take the train to work on Sunday as it was his weekly off. But he turned up at the auto stand at 7.40am, a little later than his routine, and was apprehended.The murder weapon — a small pair of tongs — was recovered from a bridge at Malad station where Shinde had thrown it after committing the crime.","Omkar Shinde, 27, was arrested on Sunday morning at an auto stand outside Malad railway station.

MUMBAI: Sahar police arrested cab driver Deshraj Yadav (50) for allegedly fleecing a US national of Rs 18,000 ($200) for a 400-metre drive to a five-star hotel near the Mumbai International Airport after she arrived from the USA on Jan 12.Police said Yadav took the woman on a 20-minute drive in Andheri (East) before returning to the same locality, dropped her at the hotel and collected the fare. The action was initiated and Yadav was arrested within three hours on a suo-motu first information report (FIR) registered against him on Jan 27, when the foreign national did not respond to Sahar police.The matter came to light when the woman posted details on Jan 26, after she created an account on X (formerly Twitter) the same day. Her post had over 1.15 lakh views. In the post on X, Argentina Ariano (@ArgentinaAriano) said: ""Landed in Mumbai recently and took a taxi to @HiltonHotels. The driver and another guy took us to an unknown location first, charged us $200 (₹18,000), and then dropped us at the hotel which was only 400m away. Taxi No: MH 01 BD 5405 #taxidriver #mumbai #RepublicDay2026 #india.""Despite a delay of almost two weeks after the victim posted details on X, police tracked down the accused based on the vehicle registration number the US woman had posted on X.DCP (Zone VIII) Maneesh Kalwaniya supervised Sahar police senior inspector Manoj Chalke and his team, who gathered information about the hotel where the foreign national woman stayed and learnt that she checked in on Jan 12, checked out the next day and went to Pune, from where she returned to the US. ""We are trying to get the victim's statement. She did not inform the hotel staff about the incident. We have repeatedly informed people to communicate with the hotel or the local authority if a tourist suspect that the cabbie is fleecing them,"" said Chalke.Police said they were also searching for Yadav's accomplice who was involved in the crime. Yadav is in police custody and his cab is seized. ""We are going to send his details to the RTO for his licence cancellation. They have been booked for cheating,"" a police officer said.In Dec 24, 2024, Australian NRI businessman D Vijay (49) fell victim to a taxi driver for overcharging Rs 2,800 for a 10-minute journey from the Mumbai International Airport to a Vile Parle hotel. Following an email complaint from Vijay after he reached Nagpur, Sahar police arrested the cab driver, Vinod Goswami (32). On Dec 14, 2024, Sahar police arrested an auto-rickshaw driver, Ritesh Kadam (26), for robbing Rs 3,500 from a 19-year-old US-based chemical engineering student, Vishwajeet Patil, from Sangli when the fare to Chembur showed Rs 106 on his meter. Police said the student had returned on a college holiday from the US, and was travelling to Dadar railway station after landing at Mumbai Airport.Experts recommended installing clear signage outside the airport to safeguard foreign tourists from such deception, citing the lack of an adequately staffed help desk at Mumbai Airport despite its international status.IPS officer-turned-lawyer YP Singh said making complaint should be made user friendly and telephone numbers where complaint can be made to police should be permanently displayed on the inside and outside of every cab. ""Very often, it is seen that the tout is hand-in-glove with the security staff. The problem is less of system but more of enforcement. In serious cases, FIR ought to be registered for extortion and cheating. In less serious cases, the cabbie permit needs to be cancelled,"" Singh said.Social activist Mohammed Afzal said the problem had been going on for the last two-three decades. He said police were supposed to keep a check that foreigners were not fleeced by taxi drivers, but it still happened, and a stringent law should be implemented to curb the menace.","Cabbie fleeced a US national of Rs 18,000 ($200) for a 400-metre drive to a five-star hotel.

NEW DELHI: A pin-drop silence enveloped Delhi's Safdarjung Enclave on Thursday as the mortal remains of pilot Shambhavi Pathak were brought to her residence. Curtains remained drawn and gates shut, and residents spoke in hushed tones as grieving relatives began arriving at the family's home. Many paused to ask mediapersons about the address of Pathaks' new residence, as the family recently shifted to a new block within the locality.Pathak (25) was among the five people killed when a VSR Ventures Learjet 45 crashed in Baramati. The aircraft, which had Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on board, went down minutes before its scheduled landing.Her neighbours gathered silently along the lane, some with folded hands, others wiping tears. Shortly thereafter, the family left for Lodhi Road crematorium, where Pathak was cremated amid the presence of close relatives and friends. ""This locality has never seen such silence,"" said a resident, adding that people were just standing, not speaking, as if words had failed everyone.Pathak's mother, a teacher at the Air Force Bal Bharati School, remained inconsolable, relatives said. Her father, a retired Indian Air Force pilot, who had rushed to Baramati following news of the crash, returned to Delhi for the final rites.The couple, both in their late 40s, had been preparing for their daughter's wedding, neighbours had recalled.A family member described the loss as irreparable. ""It is a big loss to all of us who knew Shambhavi personally. She was a very lively person and a very dedicated pilot,"" the relative told PTI.A close family friend echoed the sentiment, saying Pathak would always be remembered for her boundless energy.""She was not just a friend, she was the best friend. Not even a single one of us could match her energy and positive nature towards everything,"" he said.Visitors continued to arrive throughout the day, including former classmates, aviation colleagues, senior Air Force officials and neighbours who had known Pathak since her teenage years. Many recalled how she would greet everyone warmly, regardless of age or position.""She had this habit of acknowledging everyone with respect,"" said a security guard who has worked in the area for decades.Pathak had been associated with VSR Ventures since 2022 as a first officer. An alumna of the Air Force Bal Bharati School, she underwent flight training in New Zealand, earning a commercial pilot licence before completing a BSc in aeronautics from the University of Mumbai. She held a Frozen ATPL (an aviation qualification) and multiple other related certifications, including a Flight Instructor Rating.","Shambhavi Pathak was among the five people killed when a Learjet 45 crashed in Baramati.

MUMBAI: Low visibility did set off the series of events that led to Wednesday Learjet crash that killed deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and four others, said senior pilots who analysed the CCTV footage of last seven seconds of the accident.The fixed CCTV camera installed at Gojubavi village gram panchayat office that captured the last seconds of the plane before crash was not positioned for aviation monitoring and had partial visual obstructions from buildings, trees and overhead cables.According to the time stamp on the footage, the aircraft entered the camera's field of view at 08:43:58, descending towards the runway. Two seconds later, at 08:44:00, the aircraft was seen undergoing an abrupt roll to the left, with the bank angle increasing suddenly to nearly 90 degrees. The Learjet was in a near-vertical orientation as it continued its descent in an abnormal attitude.A second or two later, the aircraft disappeared from view due to obstructions along the CCTV camera's line of sight. At 08:44:05, a fireball soared up, indicating that the aircraft had impacted the ground. The short interval between the onset of the steep roll and the crash suggests that the loss of control occurred while the aircraft was still airborne and at low altitude.""The pilots had no time or altitude to recover and do a second go-around,"" said an A320 commander.During final approach on runway 11, the crew reported to the Baramati air traffic control, manned by pilots of a flying training organisation, that the runway was not in sight and initiated a go-around, said a statement issued by the ministry of civil aviation on the day of the accident.During the second attempt too, they could not visually spot the runway, again indicating a visibility issue. ""After a few seconds they reported runway is in sight and the aircraft was cleared to land,"" the statement said, adding that the pilot did not give a read-back of the landing clearance, as is the norm in the radio communications protocol.Officials familiar with the probe said the visuals are not consistent with a controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) scenario, in which an aircraft under control impacts the ground due to factors such as poor visibility or navigation error. Instead, the footage shows that the wings were not straight and level in the final few seconds before the crash.Pilots attributed the reason for that sharp and abrupt roll to various possible factors. ""It could be an engine failure leading to asymmetry and possible application of wrong rudder,"" said a senior pilot.Another pointed to a possible technical problem with control surfaces. ""It's possible that they visually spotted the runway late, when they were well below the 'decision height', and then they tried to align the aircraft to the runway to land, and the aircraft went out of control either because of too much correction or some other technical problem,"" said another commander.Ideally, if the runway is not in sight by the time the aircraft descends to the decision height, which is about 200 metres above ground, then a go-around or diversion should be the next course of action.",Low visibility did set off the series of events that led to Wednesday Learjet crash that killed deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and four others.

"18 spared noose, 5 freed as Calcutta HC decides 20 death-penalty cases in 2025; highest in six years",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/18-spared-noose-5-freed-as-calcutta-hc-decides-20-death-penalty-cases-in-2025-highest-in-six-years/articleshow/127791262.cms,"



KOLKATA: In 2025, Calcutta High Court rewrote 20 deathsentence orders, the highest in the past six years, commuting several sentences to life imprisonment and even acquitting some convicts. By contrast, only two death-penalty cases were heard in 2020.Among the 20 cases disposed of by the HC last year, death sentences of 18 convicts were converted to life terms, five were acquitted and one died in jail during pendency of appeal. Sixteen of 20 cases were heard in Kolkata and the rest by Jalpaiguri Circuit Bench.The HC orders follow the trend displayed in recent years by Supreme Court in converting capital punishment into life imprisonment. The apex court had in 2022, in the case Manoj vs State of MP, mandated trial courts to analyse “mitigating factors” like the convict’s psychiatric and psychological health, socio-economic background, age and the possibility of reform before awarding death sentence.The SC has in recent cases also narrowed the definition of ‘rarestof-rare’ category that allows a person convicted of murder to be awarded death penalty if the crime is exceptionally heinous, brutal or revolting.Based on these factors, the death sentence of 45-year-old Suresh Paswan, who had raped and murdered a two-and-ahalf-year-old in Kidderpore, was commuted to life without remission for 50 years. His psychological evaluation report said he suffered from mild mental disability and socioeconomic report said he came from a very poor background. He lived in a stable. “His father died before his birth... His life has been reeling under poverty,” the court held.In another case, the death penalty awarded to a 58year-old convict, Srimanta Tung, who had raped and murdered a 14-year-old girl who worked at his home, was commuted to life imprisonment without remission for 20 years based on his age. “According to the Supreme Court, a convict too young or too old should not be awarded the death penalty,” ruled a division bench of Justice Debangsu Basak and Justice Md Shabbar Rashidi.In the case of 24-year-old Susanta Chowdhury, death penalty was converted to life imprisonment with no remission for 40 years because the HC held that the crime was not ‘rarest of rare’. Chowdhury had stabbed his ex-girlfriend 45 times while pointing a toy gun at her.In the case of a 42-yearold private tutor, who had brutally killed his father, mother and sister, the HC held: “Since, we are unable to arrive at a finding that the convict is beyond reformation and that, taking into consideration the age of the convict as also the fact that there are no criminal antecedents, we are not in a position to arrive at a finding that all other penalties apart from death penalty stand foreclosed. .. We deem it appropriate to commute the death penalty to one of life imprisonment.”Advocates cited many reasons for the HC disposing of such a large number of appeals last year. Earlier, division benches were saddled with the task of hearing anticipatory bail petitions along with pleas against death penalty, life imprisonment and seven-year jail terms. Following an intervention by the SC, the HC let single-judge benches hear anticipatory bail pleas.

Iran’s Ultimatum To Trump After New US Threat; 'No Two-Hour War'





The US Navy has expanded its military presence in the Middle East by deploying another warship, as confirmed by a US official to Reuters on Thursday. This move comes during a significant military buildup in the region amid rising tensions.An official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the USS Delbert D. Black had entered the region within the past 48 hours. This raises the number of destroyers in the Middle East to six, in addition to an aircraft carrier and three other littoral combat ships.This information came a day after US president Doanld Trump announced that a ""massive Armada"" was heading to Iran. ""It is moving quickly, with great power, enthusiasm, and purpose. It is a larger fleet, headed by the great Aircraft Carrier Abraham Lincoln, than that sent to Venezuela. Like with Venezuela, it is, ready, willing, and able to rapidly fulfill its mission, with speed and violence, if necessary,"" he had said.Further calling on Iran to strike a deal, ""Hopefully Iran will quickly “Come to the Table” and negotiate a fair and equitable deal - NO NUCLEAR WEAPONS - one that is good for all parties. Time is running out, it is truly of the essence! As I told Iran once before, MAKE A DEAL! They didn’t, and there was “Operation Midnight Hammer,” a major destruction of Iran. The next attack will be far worse! Don’t make that happen again. Thank you for your attention to this matter!""Trump has not yet approved military action or selected from the options presented by the Pentagon, according to officials.They said he is still open to a diplomatic solution, and acknowledged that publicly signaling the possibility of military force is partly aimed at pushing Iran toward negotiations. In recent days, Trump has also been considering whether pursuing regime change in Iran is a realistic option, as reported by NYT.However, officials said they are doubtful that Tehran would agree to the conditions set out by the US. These include a permanent halt to all uranium enrichment and giving up its existing nuclear stockpiles — starting with more than 960 pounds of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels. Much of that material is believed to be buried under debris from strikes carried out in June.The US demands go beyond the nuclear issue. They also include restrictions on the range and number of Iran’s ballistic missiles, as well as a complete end to its support for proxy groups across the Middle East, including Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis in Yemen.","The US Navy has expanded its military presence in the Middle East by deploying another warship, as confirmed by a US official to Reuters on Thursday.

A diplomatic tension has been triggered between the US and Mexico after FBI director Kash Patel claimed that his agents arrested drug lord Ryan Wedding, a former Canadian Olympian, in Mexico. Mexico president Claudia Sheinbaum said there was no US involvement and Wedding actually surrendered. She said she won't fight over this with Patel, but Wedding was turning himself in.The 44-year-old Canadian has been running a major cocaine trafficking network and was on the list of America's most-wanted. After his arrest, he was transported to California where he pleaded not guilty in federal court to 17 felony charges, including murder.But the circumstances in which he was arrested remain grainy as Mexican president cited a photo of Wedding purportedly standing outside the decommissioned US embassy building, which is believed to be an AI-generated image. When journalists pointed out that the image is fake, the president said there was no indication by social media companies that the photo was fake.“I’m not going to get into a debate with the FBI director, nor do I want there to be a conflict,” Sheinbaum said.“What they, the U.S. authorities, told the Mexican authorities is that it was a voluntary surrender.”Wedding's layer Anthony Colombo told Wall Street Journal that Wedding was handcuffed by FBI agents. Law enforcement officials made contact with Wedding who was believed to be armed at that time. There was an intense negotiation where he was told that his associates had already been captured and millions of dollars of his assets had been seized. Colombo said FBI arrested Wedding in Mexico and it's not true that he turned himself in.US officials said the FBI involvement was a secret because foreign agents cannot officially be present in Mexico and conduct an operation. But Wedding was arrested after US ad Mexico officials coordinated closely and Patel himself was in Mexico, they said.","FBI director Kash Patel claimed that his agents arrested drug lord Ryan Wedding, a former Canadian Olympian.

Trump To Pull Out ICE From Minnesota? Panic Hits White House After Fiery Backlash From MAGA Voters





: In a move that underscores the MAGA v Moderate Republican politics in the US heartland, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on Wednesday announced a sweeping investigation into alleged abuse of the federal H-1B visa program, targeting what his office described as fraudulent schemes that disadvantage U.S. workers.Paxton said his office issued Civil Investigative Demands (CIDs) to the three North Texas companies requiring them to turn over records related to their operations, employees, and visa sponsorship practices. The businesses, which are purportedly run by Indians according to local media reports, are suspected of creating “sham companies” and maintaining “ghost offices” in order to improperly obtain H-1B visas for foreign workers.According to the attorney general’s office, some entities allegedly used misleading websites advertising products or services that do not exist, with the sole purpose of justifying visa sponsorships. “Any criminal who attempts to scam the H-1B visa program and use ‘ghost offices’ or other fraudulent ploys should be prepared to face the full force of the law,” Paxton said in a statement, arguing that such abuse “strips jobs and opportunities away from Texans.” His office also launched a public tip portal to solicit information on potential violations.As of this week, no charges have been filed, and the companies under investigation – which Paxton did not name – have not publicly responded. Local reports named two of the companies: Qubitz Tech Systems LLC, which reportedly has 13 approved H-1B visa employees; and 3BEES Technologies, with 27 H-1B visas approved between 2022 and 2025.Industry insiders say Paxton and the MAGA media are mischaracterizing a standard business model in the IT consulting world, where a ""bodyshop"" often has a small administrative footprint (sometimes a home office) because its workers are physically located at the offices of major clients (like banks or telecom giants). Several Indian IT companies, including TCS, Infosys, and Wipro, have large operations in Texas, employing thousands of workers, including native-born Americans.But Paxton’s investigation seeks to prove some of the smaller, so-called ""body shops"" are not legitimate consulting firms but ""sham"" operations that exist to charge fees for visa sponsorship and offer “bench” services to clients while collecting part of the workers’ wages.The H-1B program allows US employers to hire foreign workers in specialty occupations such as technology, engineering, and medicine. While widely used by major employers, the program has long drawn criticism from labor advocates and immigration skeptics who argue it can be exploited to undercut domestic wages or replace US workers. Texas ranks second only to California in the number of H-1B approvals, heightening the local political and economic stakes.Paxton’s move follows an executive directive issued by Governor Greg Abbott one day earlier, ordering state agencies and public higher education institutions to freeze new H-1B visa petitions until May 31, 2027. Affected agencies must report details on current visa holders to the Texas Workforce Commission by March 27, including job roles, countries of origin, visa expiration dates, and efforts to recruit Texans first.The state actions mirror heightened federal scrutiny of the program. In September 2025, US Citizenship and Immigration Services and the Department of Labor launched coordinated fraud investigations, including the Labor Department’s “Project Firewall,” aimed at ensuring employers prioritize American workers and comply with wage and recruitment rules.While framed as an enforcement effort, Paxton’s investigation also unfolds against the backdrop of his Senate campaign. Paxton is challenging John Cornyn, a four-term senator and former GOP whip, in the March 3, 2026, Republican primary. Paxton has cast himself as a hardline conservative aligned with “America First” priorities, repeatedly criticizing Cornyn as too moderate on issues such as US aid to Ukraine and immigration.Recent polling shows Paxton and Cornyn effectively tied, and with a third candidate, Congressman Wesley Hunt also in the field, there is the possibility of a May runoff if no candidate gets 50 per cent vote. President Trump is yet to weigh in on the race.Taken together, the investigation and the Senate race underscore a broader struggle within the Texas Republican Party between MAGA-aligned insurgents and more traditional conservatives. The outcome could shape not only the party’s direction on immigration policy, but also Texas’s influence in national debates over labor, work visas, enforcement, and economic growth.","Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced a sweeping investigation into alleged abuse of the federal H-1B visa program.

What is O-1 or Einstein visa ?





Meta scientist Zifan Wang announced on X that he would be moving out of the US after seven years, including his years of study and work, as his visa was not stamped for re-entry. The incident drew huge backlash as the Donald Trump administration has taken a hard stand against foreigners living on US soil, though reports of OnlyFans creators getting O-1 visa to work in the US surface from time to time.""When I visited my family and friends in China last month, my O1 visa stamp for re-entrance was denied so it is not possible for me to return US immediately after my trip, which was unexpected and crazy.

""Moving from the US to the UK because we denied his visa re-entry. We are brain draining ourselves,"" Stapp added.While the US job narrative is dominated by the H-1B debate as America First activists claim that tech companies hire cheap labor in the name of skilled employees from foreign countries like India and China, the O-1 visa rises above this mediocrity claim.

An Indian national in New York was indicted for allegedly smuggling Indian nationals from Canada into the United States.The defendant, identified as Shivam, 22, faces one count of conspiracy to illegally bring ""aliens"" into the United States and four counts of illegally bringing individuals into the country for private financial gain. A federal grand jury in the Northern District of New York returned the indictment Wednesday.According to court documents, Shivam allegedly directed the smuggling operation from January through June 2025, coordinating the illegal transport of individuals across the US-Canada border into Clinton County, New York.The investigation centers in part on a January 2025 incident, when US Border Patrol agents attempted to stop two vehicles traveling in tandem near the northern border. Both vehicles fled, triggering a pursuit. One vehicle went off the road and became immobilized, while the second was later stopped in Mooers, New York. Authorities found a total of 12 undocumented individuals inside the two vehicles.Prosecutors allege that WhatsApp messages between one of the drivers and a phone number linked to Shivam showed repeated coordination of smuggling activities before and during January 2025.The messages reportedly included proof-of-life photographs and directions to safe houses in upstate New York, according to the Justice Department.If convicted, Shivam faces a maximum of 10 years in prison for each count. A conviction on all four counts of illegally bringing individuals into the United States carries a mandatory minimum sentence of five years and a maximum of 15 years.Shivam was initially charged in June 2025 by criminal complaint with one count of conspiracy to transport individuals illegally.","Shivam, 22, faces one count of conspiracy to illegally bring ""aliens"" into the United States and four counts of illegally bringing individuals into the country for private financial gain.

U.S. Issues Alert For Its Citizens In Israel As Iran Vows Retaliation If Attacked By Trump





The Trump administration is hosting senior defense and intelligence officials from Israel and Saudi Arabia for separate talks on Iran this week in Washington as U.S. President Donald Trump considers military strikes, according to two people familiar with the matter.Tensions have escalated amid a U.S. military buildup in the Middle East. Trump urged Iran on Wednesday to come to the table and make a deal on nuclear weapons or face a U.S. attack, drawing a threat from Tehran to strike back hard.Israel's military intelligence chief, General Shlomi Binder, held talks on Iran with senior officials at the Pentagon, the CIA and the White House on Tuesday and Wednesday, a source familiar with the matter said. Axios reported that he shared intelligence on possible Iranian targets.Saudi Defense Minister Prince Khalid bin Salman was also in Washington for meetings with U.S. officials focused on Iran, according to a second source familiar with the discussions. The Saudis and other Gulf states have sought to de-escalate the situation and prevent a wider war.Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian that Riyadh would not allow its airspace or territory to be used for military actions against Tehran, state news agency SPA reported this week.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Trump is weighing options against Iran that include targeted strikes on security forces and leaders to inspire protesters, multiple sources said, even as Israeli and Arab officials said air power alone would not topple the clerical rulers.Trump has not made a final decision on a course of action, including whether to take the military path, one of the sources and a U.S. official said.","Israel's military intelligence chief, General Shlomi Binder, held talks on Iran with senior officials at the Pentagon, the CIA and the White House.
