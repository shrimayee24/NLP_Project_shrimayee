CBI checks call records of Sandip Ghosh and

Abhijit Mandal

KOLKATA: The CBI on Thursday questioned TMC youth leader Ashish Pandey , who is also a house staff at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, in connection with the rape and murder of the doctor, an officer said. Pandey was interrogated for several hours at the CBI's CGO Complex office before he left late in the night.Ashish Pandey is close to Sandip Ghosh and suspended doctor Avik De . Pandey had allegedly checked into a Salt Lake hotel on Aug 9.""Pandey's phone number was found in the call lists of several persons.He had checked in at a hotel in Salt Lake with a woman friend on the day the trainee doctor's body was found. We are trying to ascertain his activities on that day,"" the CBI officer said.The CBI is also seeking information from the hotel regarding Pandey's bookings and payments.The officer added, ""The hotel room was booked via an app. He checked in on August 9 afternoon and left the next morning. We are trying to find out what was the purpose of his stay there.""The agency spoke to a hotel staff on Thursday and checked the register. They said that the hotel room was booked through a mobile app in the name of Pandey.The CBI has also initiated an investigation into the call records of Sandip Ghosh and Tala OC Abhijit Mandal. The agency suspects that Ghosh may have been acting under someone else's direction.During the custodial interrogation , additional mobile numbers have emerged, leading the agency to believe that more individuals may be involved in the destruction of evidence. After a face-to-face confrontation between Mandal and Ghosh, the CBI suspects that they were in contact with each other and attempted to ""vitiate the evidence"". The agency also questioned the hasty cremation of the body despite the parents' demand for a second autopsy.On Thursday, the CBI questioned DYFI leader Minakshi Mukherjee , who had stopped the vehicle carrying the doctor's body on August 9. Mukherjee had previously claimed that the doctor's cremation was carried out in a hurried manner. She was among the few individuals who had interacted with the victim's parents that day. Upon leaving the CBI office, Mukherjee stated that she had cooperated with the officers.Additionally, the CBI questioned Anjan Adhikari, the MSVP of Calcutta Medical College, for the second day in a row.",TMC youth leader Ashish Pandey is also a house staff at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. Pandey was interrogated for several hours at the CBI's CGO Complex office before he left late in the night.

J&K's ace swimmer looks to sink Omar's poll hopes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jks-ace-swimmer-looks-to-sink-omars-poll-hopes/articleshow/113559665.cms,"GANDERBAL: An ace swimmer seems to be giving the sinking feeling to National Conference mascot Omar Abdullah in Ganderbal . And the legend of Bashir Mir is that he is a daredevil who rushes to the ‘darya’ and plunges into the choppy currents to rescue people, sans concern about his own well-being.From the picturesque Kangan, Mir’s hometown, to the end of the buzzing Ganderbal right to the edge of Hazratbal in Srinagar, people only talk about Mir’s skill in water.The rest follows: if a young man routinely stakes his life for others, he would be around for his constituents, in good times and bad.With the endearing immodesty of a villager, Mir explains his widespread fame as a rescuer with a laconic, “I am a good swimmer.” But it hides the awe that young boys and old men across the length of Kangan-Ganderbal have for the 48-year-old youth leader of PDP . “Parvah nahin karta, kapde utarta hai aur darya mein kood jata hai, kitne log bachaye, kitne laash nikali,” is the refrain delivered in different words laced in chaste Kashmiri accent. It is as if the flowing waters of ‘nallah sind’ carry his gallant tales across the land.Kangan is on the route of Amarnath Yatra and Sonmarg. “People come from different parts of India. There are accidents. Someone slips while bathing. Sometimes vehicles fall in the river,” he said, adding that SDRF and NDRF enlist his support in tricky situations. “I am the expert. When they cannot go in or fail, they call Bashir, and he goes there,” he says with his likeable boast.According to Mir, over 20 years, he has taken out 70 dead bodies and rescued 22 who fell alone or while traveling in vehicles. “I'm famous for it,” he says.(But Bashir complains “the government never acknowledged me or gave me any award.”)The fame of water has Mir walking in the air in this election. “I am No 1. We will win, Inshallah. People know Bashir is a good man. Ganderbal is a small district with a 4 lakh population. ((They all know Bashir Mir)),” he said about his prospects against Omar.He contested twice for the neighbouring Kangan, and lost narrowly in 2014 against the NC stalwart Mian Altaf. Post-delimitation, the seat was reserved for STs, forcing Mir to migrate.Ganderbal has been a family bastion of the Abdullahs. But the man to raise the temperature in the hot seat is calm personified. Mir claims the young Abdullah did little for Ganderbal despite being the CM, a line echoed by many poor of the constituency.Mir asked, “Did you not see the videos of Omar turning his cap into a bowl begging for votes? Why do you think he is fighting from two seats now? (Everyone wants Bashir to be given a chance).”NC is banking on its organizational infrastructure and resources to tide over the challenge. (Over three generations, the NC has created lifelong supporters.) “I always voted for National. Omar will win,” said a 60-year-old. But Abdul Qadar, an NC worker, averred it was a tough fight. However, a cop near the NC office laughed away the talk of a challenge. “100% Omar will win. Omar campaigned for three days, then Farooq saab did for three days and now Omar will come again.”Given that the PDP is in a tough election this year, will it not hurt the young man despite his popularity? Mir returns to his endearing immodesty, “People will vote for Bashir.”","The legend of Bashir Mir is that he is a daredevil who rushes to the ‘darya’ and plunges into the choppy currents to rescue people. “Parvah nahin karta, kapde utarta hai aur darya mein kood jata hai, kitne log bachaye,. kitne laash nikali,” is the refrain delivered in different words laced in chaste Kashmiri accent.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113559966,imgsize-1293405,width-400,resizemode-4/113559966.jpg"

MUMBAI: Tensions rose in Dharavi after a large number of residents gathered on streets to protest against BMC's move to demolish unauthorised construction at the Subhani mosque on the 90 ft road, forcing the civic team to discontinue the action on Saturday, reports Sanjeev Devasia. Police registered a case after stones were pelted at a BMC vehicle.A large crowd gathered to protest the action at around 9 am.Subsequently, according to BMC, after mosque's trustees sought a period of four to five days to remove the encroached construction on their own, BMC gave them that deadline. According to BMC, an eviction notice was earlier served and action was initiated as per the notice.The G-North ward had initiated action to carry out demolition of unauthorised parts of the mosque twice this year, the latest on Sept 5, but the action was stopped at the last moment on both occasions. Action was stopped in Jan due to instructions from top authorities.Political activists questioned BMC action and claimed some repairs have been carried out for the safety of the structure and BMC has no right to now demolish the structure as Dharavi redevelopment project has come into being and the mosque had a photo pass. ""Police were not prepared, and told us the situation could slip out of hands and result in violence,"" said a BMC official.","A large number of residents gathered on streets to protest against BMC's move to demolish unauthorised construction at the Subhani mosque.

KOLKATA: Former R G Kar Medical College principal Sandip Ghosh ceases to be a doctor with the West Bengal Medical Council ( WBMC ) cancelling his medical practitioner registration on Thursday. Ghosh, an orthopaedic surgeon, will no more be able to practise unless the cancellation is revoked. The striking off of Ghosh's name happened on a day when various doctor organisations demonstrated in front the council's office demanding cleansing of the council that is mired in controversy.""We have cancelled the registration of Sandip Ghosh as he failed to reply to the show-cause notice even after 13 days,"" said a WBMC official.Council registrar Manas Chakraborti had told TOI on Wednesday that a decision on Ghosh's removal from the council's registration as a medical practitioner was taken and the official notice will be issued by Thursday.Ghosh, who is currently behind the bar and was served a show-cause by the council asking him to reply within three days on Sept 6, was already in CBI custody. He was arrested first on Sept 2 on financial irregularity charges to which the investigation agency added evidence destruction charges on Sept 14.The Thursday notice said that Ghosh's registration is cancelled according to provisions under section 25(a)(ii) of the Bengal Medical Act, 1914 and section 37 (iii) of the Code of Medical Ethics adopted by the council.Since Ghosh was already behind the bar when the notice was served, sources said he could contest the cancellation later as he was not available when the show-cause was served to him.In a letter signed by its president Dilip Kumar Dutta and honorary secretary Sanatnu Sen , IMA West Bengal on Wednesday had shot off a strongly worded letter to the WBMC on why it was delaying on the cancellation of Ghosh's registration.The medical fraternity has been alleging that WBMC is the origin of corrupt practices. Various doctor organisations, including the Joint Platform of Doctors West Bengal, IMA West Bengal and Protect the Warriors, held an agitation at the council's office demanding dissolution of the council and fresh polls to elect new members.""We also wanted to know what the council has done to the likes of Avik De, Birupaksha Biswas and Mustafizur Rehaman. What about its president Sudipto Roy and Sushanta Roy who are under the scanner of investigation agencies,"" said general surgery professor Manas Gumta of Joint Platform of Doctors.

"First pagers, now walkie-talkies: Lebanon on edge after new wave of explosions kill 20",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israel-hezbollah-war-mossad-pager-explosions-walkie-talkies-explosions/articleshow/113474697.cms,"Driving the news

Lebanon has been rocked by a series of devastating explosions over the past two days, leaving at least 26 people dead and thousands more injured.

The two main devices responsible for the carnage — pagers and walkie-talkies—were in widespread use by Hezbollah operatives.

These seemingly mundane objects detonated across the country in a coordinated wave of attacks, with security experts pointing fingers at Israel.

As per a report in Aljazeera, exploding devices include portable two-way radios, laptops, and even certain solar power setups. ""There are reports of several different devices blowing up.""

A number of vehicles have also reportedly burst into flames. However, it remains uncertain whether these explosions originated from the cars themselves or from objects within the vehicles.

The explosions have not only claimed lives but also unleashed panic and chaos as people fear more devices could still be rigged to explode.

Thousands of Lebanese residents have been directly affected by the blasts, which have targeted Hezbollah strongholds in Beirut and southern Lebanon.

At the same time, explosions have hit civilian areas, including shops, homes, and even hospitals. This attack represents the largest security breach in Hezbollah’s history, marking a new phase of violence between Hezbollah and Israel, who have been engaged in escalating hostilities for years.

Why it matters

The scale and sophistication of these attacks have exposed Hezbollah’s vulnerabilities in a way that few anticipated. With Israel being blamed for the operation, the explosions have dramatically heightened tensions in a region already on edge due to ongoing conflicts between Israel, Hamas , and Iran-backed Hezbollah. The attacks have struck fear into Lebanese civilians, many of whom are now terrified that everyday devices could explode at any moment.

, and Iran-backed Hezbollah. The attacks have struck fear into Lebanese civilians, many of whom are now terrified that everyday devices could explode at any moment. As per a news report from Reuters, Israel’s intelligence agency, Mossad , was behind serial explosions in pagers.

, was behind serial explosions in pagers. The orchestration of the pager bombings seemed to be an intricate undertaking that required several months of preparation. Numerous specialists suspect that Mossad tampered with the supply chain, planting explosives in hundreds of pagers prior to their importation into Lebanon. However, concrete evidence supporting this theory remains scarce at present.

Gold Apollo , a company based in Taiwan, said that it granted permission to BAC Consulting KFT, a firm located in Hungary, to utilize its name on the pagers shipped to Hezbollah. However, Zoltán Kovács, a spokesperson for the Hungarian government, announced on Wednesday that the pagers delivered to Hezbollah never entered Hungary and that BAC Consultants simply served as a mediator in the transaction.

, a company based in Taiwan, said that it granted permission to BAC Consulting KFT, a firm located in Hungary, to utilize its name on the pagers shipped to Hezbollah. However, Zoltán Kovács, a spokesperson for the Hungarian government, announced on Wednesday that the pagers delivered to Hezbollah never entered Hungary and that BAC Consultants simply served as a mediator in the transaction. Kovács further disclosed on X that Hungary's national security services were actively collaborating with international partners in the investigation.

The chaos unleashed by these attacks threatens to destabilize Lebanon further, a country already grappling with economic collapse, political turmoil, and the lingering aftermath of the 2020 Beirut port explosion.

The big picture

The attacks began when thousands of pagers used by Hezbollah exploded almost simultaneously across Lebanon and parts of Syria, killing 12 people and injuring nearly 3,000.

The next day, a second wave of explosions from walkie-talkies and solar panels caused more devastation, killing 14 more and wounding hundreds. Lebanese media have reported that some of the dead include children and civilians who were nowhere near Hezbollah operations at the time of the explosions.

Hezbollah officials have publicly condemned Israel, accusing it of committing “mass murder.” Iran, Hezbollah’s chief backer, has also blamed Israel and vowed retribution. Meanwhile, Israel has remained tight-lipped but has declared the start of a ""new phase"" in its ongoing war with Hezbollah, raising fears of a broader conflict involving Iran and its allies.

In a Daily Mail report, journalist Hassan Harfoush shared chilling firsthand accounts of the devastation. ""The scenes here in Lebanon are from a horror film—fleshless faces, eyes hanging out. With dozens dead and thousands hurt, none of us feel safe,"" he wrote.

""Beirut has collapsed into panic. The WhatsApp groups are going non-stop. There are wild rumours doing the rounds that solar panels might explode, batteries, fridges – anything. There's fake news saying phones have exploded. I know it's stupid but I even told my parents to get a fire extinguisher, just in case ­something blows up in the house,"" Harfoush wrote in the Daily Mail, echoing the fear that has swept the country.

What they are saying

Lebanese residents, gripped by panic, have taken drastic steps to protect themselves. Some have begun tearing the batteries out of their walkie-talkies and throwing them into the streets, terrified that the devices could explode at any moment. In some areas, residents have turned off Wi-Fi routers and unplugged home appliances out of fear they could also be rigged to detonate.

At Beirut hospitals, doctors are struggling to keep up with the flood of patients. ""We are seeing horrific injuries,"" said Dr Elias Warrak, an ophthalmologist at Mount Lebanon University Hospital. ""In the last 24 hours, we’ve had more than 60 to 70 percent of patients needing at least one eye removed."" Many of the injuries involve gruesome shrapnel wounds to the face, hands, and eyes, leaving many permanently disfigured.

At a funeral for victims of the first wave of explosions, panic struck again when walkie-talkies detonated during the ceremony. Attendees fled in terror as ambulances rushed to the scene. ""The Hezbollah officials present behaved as if nothing had happened, but all of us felt it, heard it,"" Harfoush recalled. This latest wave of violence has shattered any remaining sense of security in Beirut and beyond.

Zoom in

The Lebanese armed forces have been called in to conduct controlled explosions of any suspicious devices. In one instance, soldiers detonated a bag of rice at the American University of Beirut Medical Centre, fearing it had been rigged with explosives. The Lebanese army is also working to neutralize compromised solar panels and radios, but the sheer number of devices in circulation makes the task daunting.

Images of exploded walkie-talkies and pagers show them labeled with “ICOM” and “Made in Japan.” While the devices appear to be from the Japanese electronics firm ICOM, the company has denied any involvement, saying that the specific models used in the attacks were discontinued in 2014. Taiwanese firm Gold Apollo has also distanced itself, saying that its pagers had been licensed to a Hungarian company, BAC Consulting, which acted as an intermediary.

Between the lines

Experts believe the devices were likely tampered with before they were delivered to Hezbollah, indicating a long-term infiltration of the group’s supply chain. Some security sources have suggested that small explosives were hidden inside the devices and remotely triggered, possibly through radio frequencies. This level of sophistication suggests the involvement of a state actor, with Israel’s Mossad being the most likely culprit.

The psychological impact of the explosions has been devastating. ""People used to think that if they were affiliated with Hezbollah but not fighters, they were safe. But this changes everything,"" said a Hezbollah source. Civilians who once believed they were outside the conflict’s direct line of fire are now terrified that their homes, shops, or workplaces could become the next target.

What’s next

The situation remains highly volatile, with Hezbollah vowing to retaliate. Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, is expected to make a public address, possibly outlining the group’s plans for retaliation.

Meanwhile, Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant has warned that Israel is just beginning its ""new phase"" of war, which could see more aggressive military actions in the coming days.

There is a growing fear that the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah could escalate into a full-scale regional war, drawing in other countries such as Iran and Syria. Meanwhile, residents in Lebanon are left wondering whether any electronic device could be the next to explode.

Lebanon is reeling from a second wave of deadly explosions targeting electronic devices used by Hezbollah , just a day after hundreds of the militant group's pagers detonated simultaneously. The latest attacks, which are widely believed to have been carried out by Israel, have heightened fears of an all-out war between the two sides. The explosions have also raised concerns about the extent of potentially compromised devices, especially given the high number of civilian casualties.(With inputs from agencies)","Lebanon has been rocked by a series of devastating explosions over the past two days, leaving at least 26 people dead and thousands more injured.

The 37-year-old was believed to have been stabbed to death, and a man has been arrested in connection with the crime, as reported by Georgian media.Abramidze, 37, was one of Georgia 's first openly transgender public figures.The law includes bans on same-sex marriages and gender-affirming treatments, and it allows officials to ban Pride events and censor films and books.The new legislation, which passed its third and final reading in parliament on Tuesday, has been controversial. Critics say it mirrors anti-LGBTQ+ measures in Russia.

Last year, opponents of gay rights disrupted an LGBTQ+ festival in Tbilisi, forcing it to be canceled. This year, a large march promoting ""traditional family values"" took place, attended by the ruling party and the Orthodox church. European Union officials and other critics have warned that the new law could harm Georgia's EU membership aspirations.

The move comes after the couple petitioned the Islamabad High Court to stay the proceedings and sought acquittal.The Al-Qadir Trust case centers on accusations that Khan and his wife caused a loss of over Rs 50 billion to the national exchequer.An anti-corruption court has been overseeing the trial, where so far, the statements of 35 witnesses have been recorded, leaving only the investigating officer to be cross-examined by the defense.A two-member bench headed by Chief Justice Amir Farooq heard the plea on Wednesday. Although the bench rejected the request to completely halt the legal proceedings, it granted relief by restraining the accountability court from issuing a final verdict.Khan and Bibi's lawyers argued that recent amendments in anti-corruption laws make the charges against the former prime minister and his wife invalid. They contended that the approval of the federal cabinet was involved in the matter, and the revised laws make it clear that the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) cannot investigate decisions made by the cabinet.""The case does not stand after the new amendments, and we seek acquittal for our clients,"" argued the defense.The court has issued notices to the involved parties, and the trial remains ongoing.

The amount had been part of a settlement with the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) and later adjusted against a Supreme Court fine imposed on Hussain.","Former Prime Minister Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, seek acquittal.

In response, district police initiated an investigation, analyzing CCTV footage from various surveillance cameras to identify the militants responsible for the attack.The militants used PUBG's chat room as a means of communication to evade electronic surveillance, making it difficult for authorities to monitor their activities.Zahidullah, the district police officer of Swat, revealed that while investigators initially focused on a motorcycle seen in CCTV footage near the police station prior to the explosion, their efforts to identify the nature of the attack were complicated. He said police found one person using a mobile phone and they believed that it would help them to hunt down the militants. However, militants never called each other but utilised features of PUBG to avoid being traced, he added.“The militants would play PUBG to practice and motivate their group members for battle against the state and would use the chat room for communication,” Dawn quoted Zahidullah as saying.The investigation ultimately revealed that the attackers had employed an improvised explosive device (IED) constructed from a power bank, rather than a hand grenade, as initially suspected.CCTV footage led to the identification of one suspect, which subsequently resulted in the arrest of additional suspects who disclosed their affiliation with a local militant group, Murad alias Rehmatullah, associated with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan .The arrested suspects admitted to maintaining communication with their group and family members in Afghanistan through PUBG chat rooms, frequently changing mobile phones and SIM cards to avoid detection.","Militants targeted a police station in Swat, Pakistan, on August 28, killing one officer.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) chief Imran Khan blamed the establishment, a euphemism for the military in Pakistan, for the disappearance of his party’s chief minister of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Ali Amin Gandapur , from Islamabad.Speaking to journalists at Rawalpindi prison on Friday, Khan claimed that Gandapur “was disappeared” by elements within the establishment and everyone knows who is responsible for such actions, an indirect reference to Pakistan’s intelligence agencies.He accused the military establishment of undermining the country’s institutions.According to Khan, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa CM has remained silent over his disappearance out of loyalty and respect for the establishment. Khan warned the current situation in the country is reminiscent of “Yahya Khan Part II”.Imran also spoke on the current state of governance, claiming that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif required approval (from the military) for every decision and could soon face a similar fate — disappearance.Gandapur went missing from Islamabad during a crackdown on PTI last Monday, a day after he had delivered a hard-hitting speech at a rally demanding the release of Imran Khan. He later turned up in Peshawar. Gandapur, according to PTI, was invited by the military authorities to discuss law and order matters, but he was allegedly detained without consent. His statement that he would personally secure Khan’s release in the next two weeks triggered a sharp backlash in a country where the powerful military has directly ruled the country for three decades and wielded enormous political influence even when civilian governments were in office.","Imran Khan blames the establishment for the disappearance of his party’s chief minister of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Ali Amin Gandapur.

Voting for the presidential elections began in the island nation of Sri Lanka on Saturday morning, kicking off the fight amongst 38 hopefuls for the post. The country is facing its first elections since it faced an economic crisis leading to political turmoil two years ago.The main contest is between current President Ranil Wickremesinghe , Marxist lawmaker Anura Kumara Dissanayake and opposition leader Sajith Premadasa .An opinion poll released this month indicated that Dissanayake, commonly referred to as AKD, is leading in voting preferences with 36%. He is followed by the main opposition leader, Sajith Premadasa, and President Ranil Wickremesinghe in third place, Reuters reported.Voting in the island nation began at 7 am and is set to conclude by 4 pm. With 17 million eligible voters, results are expected to come by Sunday.Aged 75, he is presently serving as the president and has also served as the six-time prime minister. Wickremesinghe assumed office following Gotabaya Rajapaksa's resignation. Despite the United National Party (UNP) having limited influence in parliament, his backing from more than 90 legislators strengthens his candidacy.The 57-year-old serves as the opposition leader of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) and is in favour of amending the $2.9 billion IMF bailout to lower taxes and alleviate the financial burden on the people. Being the offspring of a former president, Premadasa's agenda resonates with individuals looking for economic assistance and change.Aged 55, Dissanayake is the head of the National People's Power (NPP) and is gaining support for his anti-corruption position and advocacy for state-driven economic changes. Despite his party having just three seats in parliament, Dissanayake's popularity is on the rise in the nation.Namal is a member of the influential Rajapaksa family and represents the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP). Despite the family's significant influence, the 38-year-old will have to navigate the task of separating himself from the economic downturn associated with his uncle's administration.Nuwan, a 40-year-old leader, is affiliated with the Peoples' Struggle Alliance and receives backing from the demonstrations against the government that led to the removal of Gotabaya. He is against the IMF bailout and instead promotes policies that benefit the less privileged and suggests options other than international assistance.","Voting for the presidential elections began in the island nation of Sri Lanka on Saturday morning.

Harry Meghn News: Meghan and Harry's California neighbors can't wait for them to move out because...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/meghan-and-harrys-california-neighbors-cant-wait-for-them-to-move-out-because-/articleshow/113533506.cms,"Meghan Markle reeling after 'dictator' article

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's neighbors in California are reportedly fed up and want them to leave as soon as possible though there is no chance of happening it any soon as Harry's plans to return to the UK have gone for a toss. It's a posh area in Montecito with celebrities living there but still Harry and Meghan are the most talked-about couple there.So it is jealousy that the neighbors want the ex-royals to pack their bags and leave the place?Frank McGinity, a Navy vet, said he went to meet the Sussexes to help them settle in when they first came in 2020 but he was rebuffed by their security. ""Get off your street. They're not interested,"" Frank was told by the security at once though Frank was not a trespasser, he wanted to show some local history films to the Sussexes, he said.The residents in the area are typically older and they don't know why Harry and Meghan chose this neighborhood. Another neighbor Richard Mineards said the couple are rarely to be seen and out of the two Harry is still occasionally seen with his security detail but it's almost impossible to spot Meghan Markle.The Hollywood Reporter recently published a story that Meghan Markle marches like a dictator, as revealed by a former staff. The Sussexes have seen an exodus of staff members and the 'dictator' thing could be planted by any of them. It is nothing new for the Sussexes but reports said Meghan Markle is seething because Hollywood Reporter sees her in such a bad light while she is trying to get more work in Hollywood.A PR expert said Meghan and Harry have really become unpopular to the public because of their bad PR. ""To be fair to the Sussexes, they seem to have learned the lessons from bad PR, and appear to have turned the page. I attribute much of their fall-from-public-favor purely as a reflection of what can happen with bad PR. It does not mean that they’re bad people. For all we know, The Sussexes could be kind, caring and incredible people,"" a PR expert told Express UK.",Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's neighbors in California are reportedly fed up and want them to leave as soon as possible.

'Done nothing wrong': UK PM Starmer on row over accepting freebies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/done-nothing-wrong-uk-pm-starmer-on-row-over-accepting-freebies/articleshow/113500411.cms,"British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has found himself at the center of a controversy over accepting donations from a wealthy businessman and the high salary of his chief of staff.However, the prime minister denies any wrongdoing related to the thousands of pounds worth of clothing and eyewear paid for by Waheed Alli , a longtime Labour Party donor and media entrepreneur.The amount of freebies received by Starmer has surprised even his supporters, with the total value of declared ""gifts, benefits and hospitality"" exceeding 100,000 pounds since December 2019, according to Sky News. This amount surpasses that of any other lawmaker during the same period.Among the donations received are high-value tickets to Premier League matches featuring the leader's favorite team, Arsenal. Starmer, during a recent trip to Rome, expressed his deep passion for the club.“I’m a massive Arsenal fan. I can’t go into the stands because of security reasons. Therefore, if I don’t accept a gift of hospitality I can’t go to a game. You could say, ‘Well bad luck.’ … But, you know, never going to an Arsenal game again because I can’t accept hospitality is pushing it a bit far,” Starmer told reporters.Lawmakers are permitted to accept gifts but must declare donations and extra-parliamentary income within 28 days. Starmer missed the four-week deadline to declare the donations of clothing and a personal shopper for his wife from Alli, citing that the delay was due to his staff seeking advice on what needed to be declared.""I'm very consistent with following the rules,"" Starmer said this week. Additionally. he rejected suggestions that prime ministers should get a wardrobe budget, saying taxpayers should not have to pay for politicians' clothes.Additionally, there are concerns among Starmer's staff regarding the salary of Sue Gray , his chief of staff. According to the BBC, Gray earns 170,000 pounds ($225,000) per year, which is approximately 3,000 pounds more than the prime minister's salary. However, the government stated that it did not interfere in setting the pay scale for political advisers, which has been increased since the election.""The pay bands for any official, any adviser, are not set by politicians. There's an official process that does that,"" business secretary Jonathan Reynolds said Thursday.Recently, British media has been filled with mostly anonymous complaints from government officials about Gray, a former senior civil servant known for leading the investigation into lockdown-breaching parties in government buildings during the COVID-19 pandemic.Gray's findings contributed to the downfall of Conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson , and her subsequent move to work for Starmer led the Conservatives to claim that the ""partygate"" probe was politically biased, which Gray denies.Meanwhile, Labour claims that the leak of Gray's salary and the donation revelations, dubbed ""frockgate"" by the press due to the dresses purchased for the prime minister's wife, Victoria Starmer, are being exaggerated by the Conservatives and their media supporters to tarnish the government.","British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has found himself at the center of a controversy over accepting donations from a wealthy businessman.
