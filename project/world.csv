Police conducted checks and searches but didn't find anything suspicious on the complexes.The emails were sent between Monday and Tuesday, claiming that the sender had placed ""bombs inside the buildings and they would explode in the following hours"".The origin of the mails was a Cyprus-based mailing service company, beeble.com, which had been used to send the mails to hospitals on Sunday too.

On Tuesday, four hospitals also informed police about receiving similar messages. The Tihar administration then alerted the local police about the threat email received by the prison.The email read, ""I have placed explosive devices inside of your building.

"How is Pakistan buying fighter jets, submarines despite the economic crisis?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/how-is-pakistan-buying-fighter-jets-submarines-despite-the-economic-crisis/articleshow/110059597.cms,"Despite facing a dire economic situation with a foreign debt totaling $124.5 billion, equivalent to 42% of its GDP, Pakistan is persistently expanding its military capabilities, notably through substantial arms imports and collaborations with China. A report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) indicates that between 2019 and 2023, China accounted for 82% of Pakistan’s arms imports, reflecting a deepening military relationship between the two nations.""China is strongly contributing to the strengthening of Pakistan’s military by providing fighter jets, warships, missile technology, drones, etc.This is part of China’s strategy to counter the influence and power of Quad-4 (that includes India) and the West’s other regional alliances,"" an opinion piece in the EurAsian Times said.During President Xi Jinping’s 2015 visit to Pakistan, a significant agreement was forged for China to construct eight Hangor-class submarines for Pakistan, enhancing its naval power. ""The submarines will play a pivotal role in maintaining peace and stability in the region. It would add a new dimension to the ever-tested Pakistan-China friendship,” said Admiral Naveed Ashraf, Pakistani Chief of Naval Staff. This deal is part of China's broader strategy to counterbalance the influence of the Quad alliance and Western powers in the region.Amidst this backdrop of military enhancement, Pakistan grapples with an acute economic crisis , exacerbated by last year's devastating floods which led to a severe reduction in the GDP growth projection from 5% to 0.29%. The financial strain is further highlighted by a comment from the Business Standard, noting, ""Pakistan has no food for its people but purchases weapons."" The national budget reflects a 15.4% increase in defense spending, totaling 1804 billion rupees, even as the nation contends with skyrocketing inflation and widespread poverty.The economic hardships have led to public discontent, with Pakistani media reporting severe shortages of basic necessities such as food and medicines. Many believe that the real power in Pakistan lies with the military, which commands a significant portion of the national budget and operates vast revenue-generating enterprises. This perception is reinforced by international discussions, such as those held by the IMF, which highlight the disproportionate allocation of resources to the military at the expense of civil needs, the EurAsian Times report said.Adding to the controversy, recent reports from the BBC and other media outlets have suggested that despite Pakistan’s official stance of neutrality in the Ukraine conflict, there have been covert operations involving the supply of arms to Ukraine. These reports allege that under American pressure, Pakistan engaged in secret deals that not only violated its declared neutrality but also provided substantial profits from arms sales.","Pakistan is persistently expanding its military capabilities, notably through substantial arms imports and collaborations with China.

Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif approved Monday around $82.6 million (Pak Rs 2,300cr) for Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) in a bid to halt violent protests and strikes against escalating electricity tariffs , flour prices and taxes. The protests have left a police officer dead and 90 others, mostly cops, injured in the last few days.The growing unrest poses a grave challenge to Pakistan’s military, which maintains a significant presence in the region to guard the Line of Control with India.On Monday, protesters led by Awami Action Committee (AAC), an activist group that has united people to demand lower rates for essentials, continued a march to regional capital Muzaffarabad after negotiations with the govt ended in deadlock.The stalemate prompted PM Sharif, already under pressure over postponement of Saudi Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman’s crucial visit to Pakistan later this month, to clear the grant for PoK at a special meeting in Islamabad. The meeting was attended by PoK’s PM Chaudhry Anwarul Haq, local ministers and other top figures. Following the meeting, PoK PM Haq announced cuts in bread prices and electricity tariffs.Meanwhile, mobile and internet services suspended in PoK a day earlier have not been restored in most parts. Govt offices, markets, trade centres and educational institutes also remained shut.Although there have been no calls for independence in the current wave of turmoil, locals said the protests reflected a general feeling of discontent with Islamabad. In the past, Islamabad had come under fire for suppressing regional movements that demanded total independence.The recent crisis began Friday when AAC started a Muzaffarabad strike that soon snowballed into violent clashes with law-enforcement officials. The detention of over 70 activists fuelled the unrest. The movement announced its march on Muzaffarabad after talks between AAC’s core committee and PoK’s chief secretary, Dawood Bareach, in Rawalakot ended inconclusively.PM Shehbaz and President Asif Ali Zardari vowed to address the “genuine demands” of protesters, urging all to exercise restraint and resolve issues through dialogue.","Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif approved around $82.6 million (Pak Rs 2,300cr) for Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) in a bid to halt violent protests and strikes.

Hours later, five people, including a 7-year-old girl, died while crossing the English Channel in an overloaded inflatable boat.Many of the would-be migrants hail from Iraqi's northern Kurdish region.While the region is relatively more prosperous and stable than other parts of the country, increasing unemployment and corruption issues are driving many young Kurds to undertake the dangerous journey.In November 2021, 16 Iraqi Kurds were among a group of 27 people who died while attempting to cross the channel.","Barzan Majeed, known as ""the Scorpion,"" was arrested in the area of Sulaymaniyah.

NEW DELHI: One police officer was killed and over 100 individuals, primarily law enforcement personnel, sustained injuries during intense confrontations between security forces and demonstrators protesting against the elevated costs of wheat flour and electricity in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir , according to media reports on Sunday. The disputed territory experienced clashes on Saturday between the police and activists of a rights movement, coinciding with a wheel-jam and shutter-down strike across the region, as reported by the Dawn newspaper.Mirpur Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Kamran Ali informed Dawn.com that sub-inspector Adnan Qureshi succumbed to a gunshot wound in the chest while deployed with other police personnel in the town of Islamgarh to prevent a rally headed towards Muzaffarabad via Kotli and Poonch districts, organized by the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC).In the days leading up to the planned long march towards Muzaffarabad on Saturday, around 70 JAAC activists were arrested by police during raids at their residences and those of their relatives in Muzaffarabad and Mirpur divisions, sparking serious clashes in Dadyal on Thursday.

US considers sending another patriot missile battery to Ukraine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-considers-sending-another-patriot-missile-battery-to-ukraine/articleshow/110132411.cms,"The Biden administration is working to send an additional Patriot air-defense battery to Ukraine , people familiar with the matter said, as the US and its allies scramble to meet the country’s demand for more air defenses to repel an intensified Russian assault.The US is seeking to send a single battery along with radars, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations.Ukraine’s European allies are also working on plans to send Kyiv additional air-defense systems from their stocks, the people said.This week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who is visiting Kyiv, that his country needed two Patriot systems just for Kharkiv, the location of a new Russian offensive.Spokespeople for the White House National Security Council and Pentagon didn’t immediately comment.The Zelenskiy government has appealed to several allies for more of the $1 billion Patriot batteries and other air-defense systems. The US announced in 2022 it was sending one Patriot battery and has kept up a steady supply of missiles to supply what’s believed to be two other systems in the country as well. Germany committed last month to send another Patriot system.The Patriot is costly to make and maintain, and most of the dozens of systems in use are already spoken for. That’s provoked growing frustration from Ukrainian officials, who have argued that European allies especially ought to be able to spare some of the systems.“I feel myself hitting the wall with my own head, although I’m a diplomat, and that means I have to dismantle the wall brick by brick,” Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told the Washington Post in April. “But since this kind of diplomacy doesn’t work, I feel like hitting the wall. I just don’t understand why it’s not happening.”A Patriot battery includes radars and control stations to identify, track and target enemy weapons, missile launchers and support vehicles. The system’s missiles are manufactured by Lockheed Martin Corp., while Raytheon Technologies Corp. makes the radar and ground-control elements of the system.The funds for a new Patriot system would likely come out of the $61 billion assistance package recently approved by Congress.“Patriots and other sophisticated air defenses – they do more than protect soldiers and save civilian lives,” Blinken said in a speech in Kyiv on Tuesday. “They create umbrellas of safety under which Ukrainian workers and entrepreneurs can adapt, innovate, build, and attract more foreign investment.”“That’s why we’re working relentlessly with allies and partners to procure more air defense, and to do it fast,” he said.The US has been nudging allies to send Patriots to Ukraine as “a matter of utmost priority,” Biden’s national security advisor, Jake Sullivan, said Monday.“And beyond Patriots, we’re looking for other systems, as well, because we believe that there are a number of allies who have capabilities they could share and ways in which the United States could help them with their air defense needs as a backfill,” Sullivan said.Strengthening Ukraine’s air defenses has been a priority for the White House since Congress passed the national security package.","The US is seeking to send a single battery along with radars, people say.

Michael Cohen says he and Trump discussed porn star payment plot at White House,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/michael-cohen-says-he-and-trump-discussed-porn-star-payment-plot-at-white-house/articleshow/110126702.cms,"'A total disaster'

NEW YORK: Donald Trump 's former fixer Michael Cohen told jurors on Tuesday about a 2017 Oval Office meeting where the then-newly elected US president confirmed a plan to reimburse Cohen secretly for a hush money payment to a porn star.Cohen, the prosecution's star witness at Trump's criminal trial in New York, also acknowledged lying on multiple occasions - including under oath - but emphasized that he did so out of loyalty to Trump, as prosecutors sought to pre-empt an expected defense attack on Cohen's credibility.In his first day as a witness on Monday, Cohen laid out in painstaking detail how Trump ordered him just before the November 2016 election to pay the adult film actress Stormy Daniels - ""Just do it,"" Cohen remembered Trump saying - to keep her story about an alleged 2006 sexual encounter under wraps.Cohen's $130,000 payment in October 2016 is at the heart of Trump's historic trial, now in its fifth week.Trump, 77, the 2024 Republican presidential candidate, has pleaded not guilty and denies any sexual encounter with Daniels. He has characterized the case as a partisan attempt to interfere with his campaign to take back the White House he lost in 2020 to Democratic President Joe Biden.Prosecutors say Trump paid Cohen back after the election by creating false records indicating they were for legal fees. Those disguised reimbursements provide the basis for the 34 counts of falsifying business records that Trump faces.In testimony on Tuesday, Cohen recounted an Oval Office meeting in February 2017 where Trump told him that Cohen would soon receive the first monthly installments of a bonus package, which Cohen said included reimbursements for the Daniels payment.Prosecutor Susan Hoffinger walked Cohen through a series of invoices and checks - some signed by Trump himself - that Cohen said were falsely marked as paying to retain him for legal services.""There was no retainer agreement, was there?"" Hoffinger asked.""No, ma'am,"" Cohen replied.Cohen, 57, said he lied multiple times to Congress during an investigation into Trump's Russia ties, eventually pleading guilty to perjury. He also told jurors he lied repeatedly about the payment to Daniels, telling journalists Trump had no involvement.In 2018, after the Justice Department began investigating the Daniels payment, FBI agents raided Cohen's home. He said he called Trump in a panic.""He said to me, 'Don't worry, I'm the president of the United States, there's nothing here, everything is going to be OK, stay tough, you're going to be OK,'"" Cohen said. That was the last time they spoke directly, Cohen added.Instead, Cohen testified, a lawyer named Robert Costello who was close to Trump adviser Rudy Giuliani offered a ""back channel"" to Trump. In emails shown to jurors, Costello passed along Giuliani's assurances that he was loved and had ""friends in high places.""Meanwhile, Trump was defending Cohen on social media and decrying the idea that he might ""flip"" and cooperate with prosecutors. It all added up to a ""pressure campaign"" to keep Cohen in line, he said.But he eventually decided to cooperate after speaking with his family. ""It was about time to listen to them, to be loyal to my daughter, my wife, my son and the country,"" Cohen said.Cohen pleaded guilty to federal crimes in 2018, including offenses related to the Daniels payment, and said Trump - who was not charged - directed him to make the payment.His checkered history is sure to draw a bruising cross-examination from Trump's lawyers, who have already cast him as a liar and convict who cannot be trusted.A day after several Republican lawmakers attended the trial in support of Trump, US House Speaker Mike Johnson joined him and later criticized the case outside the court.While Cohen testified on Tuesday, a mid-level appeals court denied Trump's latest effort to throw out a gag order that Trump asserted violated his right to free speech.The order, imposed by Justice Juan Merchan, who is overseeing the trial, prohibits Trump from making public comments about jurors, witnesses, and families of the judge and prosecutors if meant to interfere with the case.On Monday, Cohen said Trump approved multiple payments to keep damaging sex-scandal stories out of the public eye, lest they torpedo his presidential campaign.""Everything required Mr. Trump's sign-off,"" Cohen said.Cohen said that he, Trump and tabloid publisher David Pecker had secretly agreed in 2015 to help Trump's campaign.That arrangement included a $150,000 payment from Pecker's company to former Playboy model Karen McDougal to buy her story about a year-long affair she said she had with Trump, Cohen said. Trump has also denied that relationship.As with Daniels, the intent was to acquire the rights to the story only to bury it, a practice Pecker called ""catch and kill.""In October 2016, Cohen said, he learned Daniels was shopping her story to tabloids. At the time, the Trump campaign was in crisis mode after the release of an audio recording in which Trump bragged about grabbing women's genitals.""He said to me, 'This is a disaster, a total disaster. Women are going to hate me,' Cohen told jurors Trump had said.Cohen testified that Trump was solely concerned about the impact Daniels' story could have on his White House bid - and not, as Trump's lawyers have suggested, about the effect on his wife and family. That distinction is crucial to the prosecution's case.Under New York law, falsifying business records can be elevated from a misdemeanor to a felony if the crime helped conceal another offense. In Trump's case, prosecutors have argued that the payment was effectively a secret contribution to his campaign, violating federal and state laws.The Manhattan trial is considered less consequential than three other criminal prosecutions Trump faces, all of which are mired in delays.The other cases charge Trump with trying to overturn his 2020 presidential defeat and mishandling classified documents after leaving office. Trump pleaded not guilty to all three.","Donald Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen told jurors on Tuesday about a 2017 Oval Office meeting where the then-newly elected US president confirmed a plan to reimburse Cohen secretly for a hush money payment to a porn star.

China dismissed the case as a fabrication.Britain said on Tuesday it had summoned China's ambassador to say cyberattacks and reports of espionage links were not acceptable.Keast-Butler, who was appointed GCHQ chief last year, echoed Sunak in saying the next few years would be dangerous and transformational.""Russia and Iran pose immediate threats, but China is the 'epoch-defining' challenge,"" she said.US National Cyber Director Harry Coker told the conference that Chinese military hackers were circumventing US defences in cyberspace and targeting US interests at an ""unprecedented scale"".""In a crisis or conflict scenario, China could use their pre-positioned cyber capabilities to wreak havoc in civilian infrastructure and deter US military action,"" he said.US officials confronted Beijing last month about a sweeping cyberespionage campaign dubbed ""Volt Typhoon"" in which Chinese hackers broke into dozens of American critical infrastructure organisations, using a vast global network of compromised personal computers and servers.FBI Director Christopher Wray suggested it was linked to China's broader intent to deter the US from defending Taiwan. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said Volt Typhoon was unrelated to China's government.The arrest of alleged Chinese spies, and accusations Chinese state-backed hackers stole data from Britain's elections watchdog and carried out surveillance operations, have increased strains in relations between Britain and China.Sunak said last month Chinese state-affiliated actors had conducted "" malicious cyber campaigns "" against British lawmakers and British media, citing government sources, said China was behind a hack on the British armed forces' payments system. Beijing said the accusations were absurd.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin told a press conference on Tuesday that Britain had repeatedly hyped allegations about Chinese spies and cyberattacks.","US and British officials warn of growing cyber threat from China.

The paramilitary Rangers, which were called in to maintain law and order in the disputed region, came under attack while moving out of the region, the Dawn newspaper reported.Instead of exiting via Brarkot, the village bordering Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the 19-vehicle convoy, including five trucks, chose to exit the region from Kohala, it said.As the convoy reached Muzaffarabad in a ""charged atmosphere"", it was pelted with rocks near Shorran da Nakka village, to which they responded with teargas and firing, the report said.After entering the city through the Western Bypass, the Rangers were welcomed with rocks again, prompting them to use teargas and bullets. The shelling was so intense that the entire neighbourhood reeled from it, the report said.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had yesterday approved a Pakistani Rs 23 billion subsidy for immediate release to the region after the negotiations between the protesters and the regional government ended in a deadlock.However, the government's decision to dole out the subsidy failed to pacify the region, the report said.The disputed region also witnessed clashes on Saturday between the police and activists of a rights movement, leaving at least one police officer dead and injuring over 100 people, mostly policemen.

The electricity tariff was reduced to Pakistani Rs 3, Rs 5 and Rs 6 per unit for up to 100, 300, and more than 300 units, respectively, the Dawn reported.The protest is led by the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee ( JAAC ), which has traders at the forefront in most parts of the region, who have been seeking the provision of electricity as per hydropower generation cost in the region, subsidised wheat flour and an end to the privileges of the elite class.A long march led by the JAAC left for Muzaffarabad, the capital of PoK , on Monday as the wheel-jam strike entered its fourth day.The movement announced its march on Muzaffarabad after the talks between the JAAC core committee and Chief Secretary of the region Dawood Bareach ended in a stalemate.Expressing deep concern over the violent clashes between the police and the protesters, Prime Minister Sharif on Sunday said that there should be ""absolutely no tolerance for taking the law into one's own hands"".""I urge all parties to resort to a peaceful course of action for resolution of their demands. Despite the best efforts of detractors, the matter will hopefully be settled soon,"" he said.As part of his efforts to calm down tensions, President Asif Ali Zardari urged all the stakeholders to exercise restraint and resolve the issues through dialogue and mutual consultation.","Security forces open fire on protesters in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir's capital Muzaffarabad.

The Saudi ministers, seemingly, have convinced the crown prince that political situation in Pakistan is not stable, tensions run high between the military and jailed ex-PM Imran Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), and it would be unwise for him to visit the country in the current situation,” said Shehbaz Gill , a PTI functionary and Imran’s former principal staff officer.Last month, PTI functionary Sher Afzal Marwat had alleged that Saudi Arabia was a “conduit” in the US-led operation to oust Imran’s govt in April 2022. Following his claim, PTI removed him from its core and political committee, also issuing a show-cause for trying to harm relations with Saudi Arabia.Recently, Marwat blamed the “Saudi influence” for his party dropping his name for chairmanship of public accounts committee (PAC) of parliament.While foreign ministry spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said the revised schedule of the visit is still being worked out, govt sources maintained that there were some points on the economic front that still needed to be cleared between both sides before MBS finalised his tour.They said Saudi investors and businessmen, who recently toured Pakistan, are interested in some projects but the terms of the agreement have not yet been finalised.PM Shehbaz Sharif had extended an invitation to the crown prince to visit Pakistan during his official tour to Saudi Arabia. The two sides were expected to sign a number of MoUs during the visit, as Pakistan is hoping for a huge investment package from the oil-rich kingdom.MBS had earlier cancelled his visit to Pakistan in Nov 2022.

"Stella Assange, wife of Wikileaks founder, vows to fight on ahead of crucial court date",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/stella-assange-wife-of-wikileaks-founder-vows-to-fight-on-ahead-of-crucial-court-date/articleshow/110112828.cms,"BLEAK MAXIMUM SECURITY JAIL

LONDON: In a week, WikiLeaks ' founder Julian Assange could be on a flight to the United States at the end of his years-long legal battle to avoid extradition . Whatever happens, his wife Stella vows the fight for his freedom will go on.At a hearing at London's High Court on Monday which Assange plans to attend, judges are expected to give a ruling on whether to accept U.S.assurances which would pave the way for him to be sent across the Atlantic to face 18 charges, nearly all under the Espionage Act .""It's impossible to really prepare for this moment. What I do feel is that anything could happen, that Julian could be very close to being free, or he could be very close to being put on a plane and never seeing freedom ever again,"" Stella Assange told Reuters in an interview.The High Court's decision could bring down the curtain on the Australian-born Assange's legal battles in Britain that have been going on for more than 13 years since WikiLeaks burst onto the world stage with details from what was the biggest security breach of its kind in U.S. military history.If the judges agree to the extradition, only an intervention from Europe could block it.""Unless the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) puts a stop to it, and they're able to act in time, and we're able to file in time - all these 'ifs' - then Julian could be on a military jet to the United States, a week from now,"" said Stella, who added she had ""a lot of faith"" in the ECHR.As the clock ticks down to Monday's hearing, she said her husband was very stressed and had trouble sleeping, and it was a very difficult time for her and their family.""My heart is preparing for the win. But I have to keep my head focused on the fact that he's very close to being extradited,"" she said.She said she had not told the couple's two children, now aged 7 and 5, about the extradition, saying she would not want to ""inflict the uncertainty and the prospect of them losing their father forever"".""All they know is that he shouldn't be in prison and that we're fighting to get him out,"" said Stella, a lawyer who met her husband when she joined his legal team more than a decade ago.Assange has spent the last five years in Belmarsh maximum security jail, a bleak modern prison in a remote area of southeast London, where the couple married in a 2022 ceremony attended by just four guests - two of whom were guards.For the seven years before that, he was holed up in cramped conditions in the Ecuadorean Embassy in central London where he fled to avoid extradition to Sweden over sex offence allegations which were later dropped.He had always argued that if extradited to Sweden he would then be sent to the United States over WikiLeaks' release of hundreds of thousands of secret documents and diplomatic cables.After being dragged out of the embassy in 2019 and jailed for skipping bail, the U.S. began extradition proceedings.The U.S. authorities say his actions were reckless, damaged, national security, and endangered the lives of agents.His many supporters say the prosecution is a travesty, an assault on journalism and free speech, and revenge for causing embarrassment to Western governments.Stella would not be drawn on U.S. reports that a plea bargain deal was possible, simply saying the U.S. should drop the prosecution. Should he lose on Monday, her fight, as it has for the last decade, will continue.""I'll do whatever I can, and our family is going to fight for him until he's free.""","WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange could be on a flight to the United States in a week.

UK arrests trio accused of aiding Hong Kong intelligence; commander reassures public,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-arrests-trio-accused-of-aiding-hong-kong-intelligence-commander-reassures-public/articleshow/110107782.cms,"LONDON: Three men charged with assisting Hong Kong 's foreign intelligence service in Britain appeared in a London court on Monday after a series of arrests across England.Chung Biu Yuen, 63, Chi Leung Wai, also known as Peter Wai, 38, and Matthew Trickett, 37, were arrested earlier this month following an investigation by the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command.The trio were each charged with two offences under Britain's National Security Act , which was passed last year and introduced new measures to target threats from foreign states.They are accused of assisting a foreign intelligence service between December and May by ""agreeing to undertake information gathering, surveillance and acts of deception"" in Britain, according to the charges.Hong Kong was under British rule for 156 years before reverting to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.Spying allegations against China and Russia have been piling up in Western nations in recent years, with Beijing and Moscow scoffing at them as part of a global smear campaign.The second charge alleges the three men conducted ""foreign interference"" by forcing entry into a residential address in Britain on May 1.The three men appeared in the dock at Westminster Magistrates' Court, where they spoke only to confirm their names, dates of birth and address.They were not asked to enter any pleas to the charges and they will next appear in court at the Old Bailey on May 24. All three men were granted bail.The Metropolitan Police earlier said a total of 11 people were detained this month, nearly all in the Yorkshire area of northern England.""While these offences are concerning, I want to reassure the public that we do not believe there to be any wider threat to them,"" Commander Dominic Murphy, Head of the Met's Counter Terrorism Command, said in a statement.Seven men and one woman who were not charged were released from custody, police said, adding that the investigation is ongoing.Police said the charges against the three men were not linked to a separate investigation involving Russia, which was also conducted under the same national security law.There was no immediate response from Hong Kong's Economic and Trade Office in London, Hong Kong's Security Bureau, or the Hong Kong police.","Chung Biu Yuen, 63, Chi Leung Wai, 38, and Matthew Trickett, 37, were arrested earlier this month.
