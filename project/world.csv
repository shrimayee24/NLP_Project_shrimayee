"'Durga Mata Ki Jai': On Kargil anniversary, Captain Vikram Batra's twin brother echoes J&K Rifles's war cry",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/yeh-dil-maange-more-twin-echoes-captain-batras-battle-cry/articleshow/112024978.cms,"DRASS: A more poignant act of twinning would be hard to find. As banker Vishal Batra stood at Point 5140 in Drass Thursday, scanned the horizon and yelled ""Yeh dil maange more"" thrice, he was harking back to a moment etched as much in the national consciousness as the deepest recesses of his heart.Kargil hero Capt Vikram Batra , his twin and posthumous Param Vir Chakra winner, had uttered those words 25 years ago in a famous victory message after capturing Tiger Hill.Vishal wanted to recreate the moment and feel his brother's spirit in the wind brushing against his face on that barren terrain where bravery remains the final milestone.The twins would have celebrated turning 50 together on Sept 9. Vishal, a spitting image of his brother, visited one of the posts Capt Batra had occupied a quarter of a century ago ""to be closer to him"" in their ""special year"".""After 45 days, I will be a 50-year-old with grey hair, but Vikram will remain young at 25. We shared a strong bond, being identical twins and more like friends,"" he told TOI.Vishal rounded off his tribute to the slogan immortalised by his brother with the J&K Rifles' war cry ""Durga Mata Ki Jai"".""I travelled to the remote post with permission from the Army Chief of Staff, Gen Upendra Dwivedi, who acceded to my special request. Some of the soldiers who had worked with my brother accompanied me,"" he said.""The atmosphere was charged with emotion as I walked through the area and spoke to those who had shared his journey. Each step at the post, which is at an altitude of around 17,000 feet, was a poignant reminder of the sacrifice and valour of Vikram and his men.""Capt Batra wrote four letters to his sibling between June 16 and July 5, 1999. The first spoke of his ""mission"". The second one, written on June 23, mentioned that he had been recommended for the Maha Vir Chakra, the country's second highest gallantry award.In his third letter, datelined July 2, was about him moving further for his next mission. ""We received the final letter after he died in battle,"" Vishal recalled.The twins' mother Kamal Kant Batra, who died this Feb, had named them ""Luv and Kush"" because she was a disciple of Ram.""When he was alive, I was called Kush, being the younger one. Now, I am proud to be known as the brother of Shershah (Capt Vikram's codename during the Kargil War),"" Vishal said.Vishal said he wanted to join the Army as much as his twin, and they together appeared for an SSB interview in Allahabad. ""He was selected in his first attempt, but I was rejected. I tried thrice but didn't make it. Perhaps, it was destiny. I am living a dream through my brother.""On the 20th anniversary of Kargil War in 2019, Vishal had visited Point 4875, later named ""Batra Top"". Capt Batra was among the 25 casualties the Army suffered while capturing that post. Rifleman Sanjay Kumar, among those who died fighting, was also posthumously conferred the Param Vir Chakra.","Kargil hero Capt Vikram Batra's twin Vishal visited one of the posts he had occupied a quarter of a century ago ""to be closer to him"" Vishal wanted to recreate the moment and feel his brother's spirit in the wind brushing against his face on that barren terrain.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112024997,imgsize-27832,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/112024997.jpg"
"25 years on, Kargil man who tipped off Army awaits relief for 18 yaks eaten by Pak intruders, civilian honour",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jammu/intruders-ate-my-yaks-but-i-got-no-aid-kargil-shepherd/articleshow/112024239.cms,"Tashi Namgyal

LAMOCHAN (DRASS): A quarter-century later, Namgyal has two wishes: compensation for the 18 yaks eaten by the intruders and official recognition in the form of a civilian honour . “Govt provides compensation for various losses, but I have not received anything for my yaks. I am ready to provide all details through the village nambardar to get compensated,” he said.Namgyal acknowledges the annual honours he receives from the Army during Kargil Vijay Diwas, but hopes for broader recognition.“I get Rs 18,000 a month as a ration allowance. The Army takes care of me whenever I need help. Although 25 years have passed, I still hope the Centre will give me some civilian honour for my contribution to the forces,” he said.Namgyal attended the 25th Kargil Vijay Diwas in Drass with his daughter Tsering Dolkar, a teacher. “My father is a hero for me and the entire country. He made a huge contribution to the victory in the Kargil War. He deserves the country’s civilian honour,” said Dolkar.In May 1999, as soon as he spotted the intruders, Namgyal reported the suspicious movement to local Army unit’s Havildar Balwinder Singh of Punjab Regiment and Havildar Nandu Ram of Military Intelligence. “Nandu Ram reassured me that if my information is correct, ‘you will become India’s hero, and my name will be written in golden letters’. All financial hardships would be over,” recalled the 58-year-old Namgyal, father of four from Aryan Valley in Kargil’s Garkon, which now falls in the Union territory of Ladakh.The ensuing Kargil War raged from May 3 to July 26, 1999. Thanks to Namgyal’s timely alert, Indian troops mobilised swiftly, thwarting the Pakistani military’s covert mission to sever the highway. India’s victory in Kargil was hard-won, and Namgyal emerged as a hero — the good shepherd whose vigilance turned the tide.Namgyal’s story is a reminder of the individual acts of courage that collectively shaped the nation’s victory in the war. As he continues to wait for his due recognition and compensation, his legacy as the vigilant shepherd of Kargil endures.","Tashi Namgyal spotted the intruders and reported them to local Army unit.

Authorities also warned people against providing shelter, food, or aiding the terrorists in hiding and navigating the area undetected.Earlier, police have arrested two men, including Showket Ali, who allegedly provided food, shelter, and WiFi access to three terrorists before the July 15 attack in Desa forest of Doda district that left four soldiers dead.

Modi's embrace of Russian President Putin during the visit, on a day Russia allegedly bombed a children's hospital in Kyiv, only added to the outrage in the West.Lu, however, sought to put things in context and said that Modi also met Ukraine President Zelenskyy at the G7 in Italy and that there was no major defence deal between India and Russia during his Moscow trip.

Pablo Escobar: Naidu compares Jagan Reddy to Pablo Escobar: 9 interesting facts about Colombian drug lord,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/naidu-compares-jagan-reddy-to-pablo-escobar-9-interesting-facts-about-colombian-drug-lord/articleshow/112020195.cms,"Magical realism is defined as what happens when a highly detailed, realistic setting is invaded by something too strange to believe. There was a reason magical realism was born in Colombia .

Who was Pablo Escobar?

Narcos - Main Trailer - Netflix [HD]

5) Extravagant Lifestyle:

6) Escaping Prison:

7) War with the Government:

8) Buying Power:

9) The End:

It’s fitting that the Netflix show Narcos – which focused on the Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar – starts by describing a literary phenomenon most commonly associated with Colombia author Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Escobar’s story is certainly littered with its own sprinkling of magic, how a boy who grew up in abject poverty went on to become the most powerful drug lord in the, who continued to cock his snook at the mighty US government and its DEA agents.Strangely, not unlike magic realism, the Medellin Cartel’s boss' name came up in the Andhra assembly when the Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu compared his rival YSR Congress leader Jagan Mohan Reddy to the notorious narco-terrorist and accused him of fostering a drug crisis in the state during his five-year rule. Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu declared that the state's situation during Jagan Mohan Reddy's governance was unprecedentedly dire. Naidu remarked in the assembly, ""Only one person can be compared to what happened in Andhra, and that is Pablo Escobar,"" highlighting the severity of the drug menace. He alleged that from 2019 to 2024, the state had become the ""ganja capital"" and pledged to address the issue.Naidu elaborated, ""Pablo Escobar was a Colombian drug lord and narco-terrorist who became a politician and started his drug cartel, amassing $30 billion at that time, now worth $90 billion. He was arrested in 1976 and by 1980 had become the world's richest drug lord. Some people aim to become richer by selling drugs.""Born on December 1, 1949, in Rionegro, Colombia, he rose to become one of the wealthiest and most powerful criminals in history through his extensive cocaine trafficking operations. Escobar's life has inspired numerous books, movies, and television series, highlighting his dramatic ascent and subsequent downfall in the criminal underworld.At the height of his power, Escobar was among the richest men globally, with his net worth estimated to be around $30 billion in the early 1990s. He was reportedly making approximately $420 million weekly from his drug empire.Pablo Escobar used his immense wealth to fund various community projects in Medellín, Colombia, earning a degree of local support. He built housing for the poor, constructed sports fields and facilities, and funded schools and hospitals. Escobar's investments in infrastructure included paving roads and installing streetlights in underdeveloped neighbourhoods. Additionally, he sponsored local soccer teams and provided substantial financial assistance to needy families, enhancing his Robin Hood-like reputation among the local populace.The Medellín Cartel employed numerous innovative methods to smuggle cocaine into the United States, including using submarines, airplanes, and even hollowed-out statues. Escobar owned a fleet of planes and helicopters specifically for this purpose. Escobar collaborated with Amado Carrillo Fuentes, known as ""The Lord of the Skies,"" to smuggle cocaine using a fleet of private jets and commercial aircraft.Pablo Escobar entered politics in Colombia in the early 1980s. In 1982, he was elected as an alternate member of the Chamber of Representatives of Colombia. Escobar's political career was short-lived, as his involvement in drug trafficking soon became widely known, leading to his eventual expulsion from Congress.Escobar's immense wealth enabled him to live an extraordinarily lavish lifestyle. He owned multiple properties, including the famous Hacienda Nápoles estate, which featured a zoo with exotic animals, a private airport, and a bullring. Pablo Escobar kept a variety of exotic animals at his Hacienda Nápoles estate, including hippos, elephants, giraffes, rhinoceroses, camels, exotic birds, and antelopes.In a controversial agreement with the Colombian government, Escobar was allowed to build his own luxurious prison, known as La Catedral, in 1991. This facility included amenities such as a nightclub, a jacuzzi, and a waterfall. He continued to manage his drug empire from within until he escaped in 1992 after authorities attempted to move him to a standard prison. It was also the host of many famous footballers including Diego Maradona who claims he had a great time there.Escobar's conflict with the Colombian government and rival cartels resulted in massive violence. He was responsible for numerous assassinations, bombings, and terror acts, leading to the deaths of thousands, including judges, police officers, journalists, and civilians. Escobar masterminded the infamous siege of Colombia’s Supreme Court in 1985. By the end of the operation, 12 Supreme Court Justices, 48 Colombian soldiers, and 35 members of the M-19 guerrilla group, including their leader, had been killed. In total, the conflict resulted in over 100 fatalities.Pablo Escobar used his immense wealth from drug trafficking to buy political influence in Colombia. He strategically bribed politicians, offering them large sums of money in exchange for their cooperation and protection. Among those implicated were President Alfonso López Michelsen, who allegedly received campaign funds from Escobar, and Justice Minister Rodrigo Lara Bonilla, who initially fought against Escobar's operations but was later assassinated by the cartel. Escobar's influence extended deeply into the political sphere, allowing him to evade law enforcement and expand his empire.Escobar was killed by Colombian National Police in a shootout on December 2, 1993, on a rooftop in Medellín. His death marked the end of the Medellín Cartel's dominance. Despite his criminal activities, he remains a controversial figure in Colombia, symbolizing both the extreme violence of the drug trade and the impact of his philanthropic efforts on local communities.","Magical realism is a literary phenomenon most commonly associated with Colombia author Gabriel Garcia Marquez.

'I'm not moving'

STAROKOSTIANTYNIV: With its castle, medieval tower and river-side beach, the western Ukrainian tourist town of Starokostiantyniv doesn't seem an obvious target for Russian missile and drone strikes.But a major airbase across the Sluch river has put the town firmly in Russia 's sights -- and locals fear the imminent arrival of F-16 fighter jets in Ukraine will only intensify the bombardments .""We're super nervous about the arrival of the F-16s. If they park them here, the number of attacks will only go up,"" said Olena Shpachenko, a guide at the town's history museum, located inside the 17th-century castle.Kyiv says the advanced US-made fighters, some already being transferred to Ukraine, will help it better protect its skies and compete with Russia for air superiority.Russia has intensified its bombing of Ukrainian air bases -- including Starokostiantyniv, home to the seventh tactical aviation bridge -- and pledged to target F-16s.In a show of force earlier this month, Moscow hit three Ukrainian airfields in as many days.""From here we have a good view of the explosions,"" said Shpachenko, gesturing out of the castle window.""We hear them as if we were right there,"" she told AFP.For more than two years, she has watched the enemy's explosive drones and supersonic missiles pepper the sky at night.Pointing to a row of partially damaged ancient religions icons hanging over her desk, she said the air base was ""so close, the missiles can make it all the way over here.""Ukraine and its Western partners have not given any official indication of where the F-16s will be based.A Western defence industry source told AFP the Starokostiantyniv airfield -- equipped with Soviet-era partially underground shelters -- is an ideal candidate.Residents, used to the roar of jets even before the war , say tensions in the city are ratcheting up.""The authorities held a large-scale exercise in the event of a nuclear strike. They believe the base is a prime target for Moscow,"" said Shpachenko.""We pray that the F-16s don't wind up here,"" she added, looking anxiously outside once more.Even if Ukraine's air defences intercept Russian missiles targeting the base, ""debris will rain down on the city,"" she feared.She has forbidden her daughters from playing outside.Despite being hundreds of kilometres from the front lines, the war literally hangs over the town that locals call ""Starkon"".The smell of powder and kerosene punctuate the air and the sky is strewn with black contrails left behind by the jets.Large tanks of jet fuel are hidden in the surrounding woods, where groups of soldiers were playing cards in a moment of respite.The town's lights are turned off at night and the troops scour the sky, ready to shoot down drones with machine guns.Anatoliy, the commander of a mobile anti-aircraft unit, said Russia had stepped up attacks over the past month.""The Russians are now using cluster munitions with the aim of damaging the jets on the ground,"" he said, puffing on a cigarette.The explosives can target areas covering thousands of square metres with a single drop.Asked if he thought the escalation was due to the possible arrival of the F-16s, Anatoliy hesitated, before smiling: ""The Russians, those fools, will never guess where they are.""The war has also taken its toll on the town's previously vibrant tourism industry.""The soldiers, the attacks... it discourages people from coming. We've even had drone debris fall on the beach, Shpachenko said.One family of vacationers ""heard a plane flying close to the ground, dropped their stuff and ran to the castle,"" she said.Many of the Ukrainians who came to Starokostiantyniv after fleeing their homes in the east left as soon as they heard the first roar of a fighter plane.""The desire to survive is stronger than the need for rest,"" said Shpachenko.Despite the danger, some locals were outside, relaxing in the shade of the weeping willows or on the small beach.Valery, in his 70s, has been here so long he knows the engine noises of the different planes by heart.He still goes for a morning swim in the river at the foot of the castle every day.""I'm afraid of the arrival of the F-16s. I don't know what will happen to the city if they end up here,"" he said.""Whatever happens, I'm not moving.""",Ukrainian tourist town of Starokostiantyniv is a prime target for Russian missile and drone strikes.

Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has ignited a fresh controversy by claiming that he was misled into consenting to puberty blockers for his transgender child. In a recent interview with Jordan Peterson, Musk described the experience as a ""trick"" and blamed the ""woke mind virus"" for his son's transition.Musk's child, Xavier, who now identifies as Vivian Jenna Wilson, underwent a name and gender change in 2022.Musk asserts that he was pressured into approving puberty blockers for Xavier under false pretenses, claiming that he was told the child was at risk of suicide.""I lost my son, essentially. They call it deadnaming for a reason,"" Musk said. ""The reason it's called deadnaming is because your son is dead. My son Xavier is dead, killed by the woke mind virus.""After an extended pause, Musk added, ""I vowed to destroy the woke mind virus after that.""Musk's comments have sparked intense debate over parental rights, transgender healthcare, and the influence of cultural and political ideologies on personal decisions. Critics argue that Musk's statements are harmful and stigmatizing to transgender individuals, while supporters contend that he is raising legitimate concerns about the medical treatment of minors.The controversy comes amid broader cultural tensions over issues of gender identity and parental rights. Musk's decision to relocateSpaceX headquarters to Texas, citing a new California law limiting parental notification of a child's gender identity change, further underscores these divisions.Musk's pledge to take on the ""woke"" left likely inspired his latest decision to move the California headquarters for SpaceX to Texas, after Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill into law that will bar school districts from notifying parents if their child uses different pronouns or identifies as a gender that's different from what’s on school records.""This is the final straw,"" Musk wrote on X, his social media platform, in explaining his decision.

BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh govt has rejected an RTI application seeking correspondences related to ‘ Project Cheetah ’, citing concerns over “national security, sovereignty, and integrity of India”.Wildlife activists aren’t amused. What does cheetah management have to do with national security or sovereignty, they wonder.Activist Ajay Dubey had filed the RTI plea for details about the cheetah reintroduction project, particularly how they are being cared for at Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary in Sheopur district and the plans for a second home at Gandhi Wildlife Sanctuary in Mandsaur district.He had sought records on “management correspondence” at both cheetah sites.To his dismay, the state govt denied his request, invoking Section 8(1)(a) of RTI Act, which allows public authorities to withhold information whose disclosure could “affect the sovereignty and integrity of India, its security, strategic, scientific, or economic interests, or its relations with a foreign state”.Saurav Kumar Kabra, public information officer at the office of the principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife), said: “This information is related to management branch, which has decided not to provide information under Section 8(1)(a) of RTI Act, 2005.”A bewildered Dubey remarked, “This is the first instance where information regarding cheetah conservation has been linked to national security. My efforts to shed light on the project have met with significant resistance from the authorities.”In Feb this year, Dubey said he obtained a photograph of a cheetah cub with a bandaged leg through RTI. The picture was shared widely on social media. Dubey then filed a complaint with National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), alleging that MP forest authorities had not informed it about the cheetah’s injury.","Madhya Pradesh govt has rejected an RTI application seeking correspondences related to ‘ Project Cheetah ’, citing concerns over “national security, sovereignty, and integrity of India’ Activist Ajay Dubey had filed the RTI plea for details about the cheetah reintroduction project.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112024405,imgsize-61626,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/112024405.jpg"

The group was accused by Israel of hiring individuals linked to the October 7 Hamas attacks, leading to financial withdrawals from various countries. Although Emhoff removed the link from her profile, the incident sparked backlash from UN Watch, as per reports.Ella, 25, and her brother Cole affectionately call Kamala Harris “Momala.” Emhoff gained public attention with her bold fashion choices at Harris’s inauguration and subsequently signed with IMG Models.

Previous debate agreements

Former US President and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has announced that he will not engage in a debate with his Democratic rival , Vice President Kamala Harris , until the Democrats formally confirm their nominee. Trump’s decision comes despite Harris’s readiness to participate in a debate.“I have agreed to the previously agreed-upon September 10 debate,” Harris said at Joint Base Andrews upon her return from Houston.“He (Trump) agreed to that previously. Now here he is backpedaling, and I’m ready. The voters deserve to see the split screen that exists in this race on a debate stage.”Trump, who was officially declared the Republican nominee at the party’s convention in Milwaukee earlier this month, is awaiting the Democrats' formal decision on their nominee. Harris is expected to be declared the Democratic nominee at the party’s convention in Chicago in August.“Given the continued political chaos surrounding Crooked Joe Biden and the Democrat Party, general election debate details cannot be finalized until Democrats formally decide on their nominee,” said Trump Campaign Communications Director Steven Cheung in a late-night statement.Cheung further criticized Harris, suggesting that some in the Democratic Party, including former President Barack Obama, doubt her viability as a candidate. “There is a strong sense that Kamala Harris is a Marxist fraud who cannot beat President Trump,” Cheung said.Trump and President Joe Biden had previously agreed to two debates: one on June 27 and another on September 10. However, Biden’s poor performance in the June 27 debate, hosted by CNN, led him to withdraw from the race three weeks later. The September 10 debate was slated to be hosted by ABC News.Trump has expressed willingness to debate Harris, noting that he is not thrilled with ABC. “I want to debate her, and she’ll be no different because they have the same policies,” Trump said earlier this week. He also indicated a willingness to participate in more than one debate.In light of the recent changes, Fox News Media has proposed hosting a debate between Trump and Harris on September 17 in Pennsylvania. “Now that Vice President Kamala Harris is the presumptive Democratic nominee, FOX News Media is amending our proposal for a debate this cycle,” the network stated in letters sent to both campaigns.The proposal suggests holding the debate in Pennsylvania, a key battleground state, just as early voting begins.

We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering and I will not be silent.""Harris, who assumed the Democratic presidential nomination after Biden announced he would not seek re-election, emphasized the urgency of addressing the humanitarian crisis during her ""frank"" discussion with Netanyahu. ""I expressed with the prime minister my serious concern about the scale of human suffering in Gaza, including the death of far too many innocent civilians. And I made clear my serious concern about the dire humanitarian situation there.""In addition to calling for a Palestinian state, Harris urged both Israel and Hamas to agree to a ceasefire and release hostages to end the conflict, which began with Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel. ""As I just told Prime Minister Netanyahu, it is time to get this deal done,"" she asserted.Harris's forthright stance contrasts sharply with the earlier amicable exchange between Biden and Netanyahu, despite underlying tensions and questions about Biden's influence. Netanyahu praised Biden, saying, ""From a proud Zionist Jew to a proud Zionist Irish American, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the State of Israel. And I look forward to discussing with you today and working with you in the months ahead.""While Harris has previously been more vocal about Gaza than Biden, White House officials maintain there is no significant policy divergence between them. The White House stated that Biden would emphasize the need for ""compromise"" in a deal, following Netanyahu's assertive speech to the US Congress.Biden and Netanyahu also met with families of US hostages held in Gaza, who expressed cautious optimism about a potential new ceasefire proposal. ""We feel probably more optimistic than we have since the first round of releases in late November,"" said Jonathan Dekel-Chen, father of American hostage Sagui Dekel-Chen.Protests erupted outside the White House, echoing the demonstrations during Netanyahu's Congressional address. Despite ongoing US military aid to Israel since the October 7 attacks, relations with Netanyahu have been strained by Israel's war conduct and suspicions of stalling on a peace deal.The Hamas attack on October 7 resulted in 1,197 deaths in Israel, predominantly civilians, with 111 of the 251 hostages taken still held in Gaza.

She expressed her unwillingness to remain silent on the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. This marks a departure from the approach of outgoing President Joe Biden, who largely exercised behind-the-scenes pressure on Israel.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112028094,imgsize-91234,width-400,resizemode-4/112028094.jpg"
What's this California law that Musk says 'killed' his son?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/whats-this-california-law-that-musk-says-killed-his-son/articleshow/112027765.cms,"On July 17, the world's richest man Elon Musk declared he would pluck the headquarters of two of his companies - SpaceX and X - from California and plant them in Texas. Was it to save on income tax? No, Musk's sudden decision seemed to be shaped by ideology.""This is the final straw,"" he wrote on X, blaming a new California law that requires schools to keep parents in the dark about changes in their children's gender identities.""Because of this law and the many others that preceded it, attacking both families and companies, SpaceX will now move its HQ from Hawthorne, California, to Starbase, Texas,"" he wrote. As for X, it's going to Austin.Why did Musk react so strongly to this law? Was it because one of his 12 children is a transgender woman who broke all ties with him two years ago?Musk had five sons from his first marriage to Canadian author Justine Wilson. Twins Xavier and Griffin were born in 2004, followed by triplets Damian, Kai and Saxon in 2006.In 2020, amid the Covid pandemic, 16-year-old Xavier Alexander Musk came out as trans but didn't inform Papa Musk, according to the latter's biographer Walter Isaacson. Instead, Xavier texted Elon's sister-in-law: ""Hey, I'm transgender, and my name is now Jenna. Don't tell my dad.""Isaacson says Elon was ""generally sanguine"" about Xavier's transition. Until then he had seemingly embraced diversity and supported LGBTQ rights. In 2018, for example, he ticked off someone for a now-deleted post against Pride Month: ""Don't buy our car if that's a problem. People should be free to live their lives where their heart takes them.""But this was before Jenna officially changed her gender to female and her name to Vivian Jenna Wilson on turning 18 in 2022. She took her mother's surname to disassociate herself from her father, and said in her petition: ""I no longer live with or wish to be related to my biological father in any way, shape or form.""At the time, Musk had criticised the press for publishing Jenna's (she goes by her middle name) story. ""I think it is important to defend her right to privacy. Please don't out someone against their will - it's not right.""It's ironic that the new law that Musk called his 'last straw' aims to do just that - not out anyone against their will, not even to their parents.Two days before Musk decided to quit California, state governor Gavin Newsom had signed the divisive bill AB-1955, better known as SAFETY (Support Academic Futures and Educators for Today's Youth Act) into law. Musk says he had cautioned Newsom ""about a year ago that laws of this nature would force families and companies to leave California to protect their children"". So what, according to Musk, was so dangerous about this law?The law is firstly meant to protect LGBTQ+ students in schools. Nobody at school is allowed to ""disclose any information related to a pupil's sexual orientation, gender identity , or gender expression to any other person (including parents) without the pupil's consent"".Secondly, it shields school staff from the management. They cannot make any rule that forces staff to disclose information about a child's sexual orientation or gender identity to a third person. They also cannot retaliate against an employee or contractor who stands up for students in this regard.To Musk, AB-1955 is nothing but a symptom of the ""woke mind virus"" that he's been complaining about since his estrangement with Jenna. Most recently, on July 22, he brought it up in an interview with Canadian psychologist and conservative commentator Jordan Peterson, saying, ""My son is dead - killed by the woke mind virus"".So, shortly after AB-1955 became law, Musk tweeted: ""The state will take away your kids in California."" His biographer says Musk is waging war against ""woke"" thinking because the rift with Jenna has hurt him ""more than anything in his life since the infant death of his first child, Nevada."" Musk told Isaacson: ""I've made many overtures, but she doesn't want to spend time with me.""He had also indicated his opposition to laws like AB-1955 last year, when he tweeted: ""Consenting adults should do whatever makes them happy, provided it does not harm others, but a child is not capable of consent, which is why we have laws protecting minors.""The same day he wrote: ""I will be actively lobbying to criminalise making severe, irreversible changes to children below the age of consent.""In conversation with Peterson last Monday, Musk described gender-reassignment surgery as ""child mutilation and sterilisation"". He stressed that Xavier had been ""killed"" after he received gender-affirming treatments such as puberty-blockers. By stalling the production of sex hormones in teens, these drugs halt changes associated with puberty.On his own role in the process, he said, ""I was essentially tricked into signing documents for one of my older boys. This was really before I had any understanding of what was going on, and we had Covid going on, so there was a lot of confusion."" Musk says he agreed to put his son through gender-affirming care only because he was told there was a risk of the boy committing suicide.",Elon Musk is moving the headquarters of SpaceX and X from California to Texas. He blamed a new California law that requires schools to keep parents in the dark about changes in their children's gender identities.

The army said the party information secretary was in charge of PTI ’s digital media cell which, it alleged, was involved in running anti-state propaganda.Last month PM Shehbaz Sharif had approved a military offensive to counter aspikein terrorist attacks across Pakistan, particularly in volatile northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and southwestern Balochistan provinces, but the idea was widely criticised by opposition parties, particularly PTI and the rights group Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM). They termed it a ploy against Pashtuns to earn dollars from major powers and exploit their resources.Addressing a presser in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, the military’s spokesperson, Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, asked, “Why did a mafia, a political mafia , and an illegal mafia say that they would not let this campaign (OperationAzm-e-Istehkam, or Resolve for Stability) happen?” He added that opponents of the offensive had tried to make it “controversial” and paint it as a purely military operation in which thousands of people would be displaced.He did not name any party or group butcalled the army’s critics “politicalandillegal mafias”,an apparent reference to PTI and PTM.Lt Gen Chaudhry said they were using “fake news and propaganda” to spread lies about the army and its intentions.“This is digital terrorism,” he said. “The physical terrorist also attacks law enforcement agencies and the army, and the digital terrorist also attacks the army. They are doing the same thing.”“Digital terrorists”, the spokesman said, would be deterred through laws, regulation and monitoring.He, however, questioned the lack of action against such individuals despite their activities against the leadership of the state and other institutions. “Instead of the courts and regulations moving forward against them, they’re given further space and they’re made heroes in the name of freedom of expression,” he said.Ahead of Sharif’s press conference, security forces had raided PTI’s offices and arrested Raoof Hasan from the party’s central secretariat. The raid came a week after the govt had said it planned to ban the party.“The PTI digital media centre had become a centre of international disinformation, from where anti-Pakistan propaganda is run throughout the world,” Islamabad police said, adding that those directly involved in anti-national propaganda were arrested and all evidence from PTI’s digital media cell wasconfiscated.The party issued a statement on X, saying: “It’s absolutely shameful how Islamabad police continues to completely mock and disregard every law in this country. Law of the jungle is reigning over Pakistan!”The crackdown on PTI follows several court rulings in its favour this month that threaten PM Sharif’s govt, which came to power in Feb this year with the military’s backing.","Pakistan army accuses its criticsof “politicising” its anti-terrorism efforts.

He questioned whether the army should be responsible for these tasks.The DG ISPR also mentioned the issue of the ""illegal spectrum"", which hides a major illegal economy through which the criminal system and terrorism operate. He said the requirement of the illegal spectrum is a ""soft state"" and the solution to it is the National Action Plan.While the DG ISPR's statements highlight the challenges faced by the government in implementing its counter-terrorism strategy, it is essential to note that the army's involvement in political matters can be a sensitive issue.The military has historically played a significant role in the country's politics, and its direct intervention in political affairs has often been a subject of controversy.It remains to be seen whether the army will take a more active role in the country's affairs in response to the alleged sabotage of the counter-terrorism campaign by the ""illegal political mafia"".","Pakistan army accuses an ""illegal political mafia "" of trying to sabotage its renewed military operation.

"Bangladesh factories, banks reopen as curfew is eased after protests taper off",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-factories-banks-reopen-as-curfew-is-eased-after-protests-taper-off/articleshow/111985045.cms,"STUDENT DEMANDS

DHAKA: Rush-hour traffic returned to the streets of the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka on Wednesday, as a curfew was eased after four days of nationwide shutdown that followed deadly protests led by university students against quotas in government jobs .Offices reopened and broadband internet was largely restored, although social media continued to be suspended, days after the clashes between protesters and security forces killed almost 150 people.The country has been relatively calm since Sunday after the Supreme Court ruled in favour of an appeal from Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's government and directed that 93% of jobs should be open to candidates on merit.Bangladesh 's mainstay garment and textiles industries, which supply to major Western brands, also began reopening some factories after a pause in production during the curfew.""All our factories are open today. Everything is going smoothly,"" said S.M. Mannan, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association.The stock exchange opened too, as well as banks, after remaining shut the past two days.Residents of Dhaka were out on the streets, some making their way to offices as public buses also began running in some places.""It was a hassle to reach the office on time,"" said Shamima Akhter, who works at a private firm in the capital. ""Some roads are still blocked for security reasons. Don't know when everything will get normal.""Local news websites, which had stopped updating since Friday, were back online too.Bangladesh authorities had shut mobile internet and deployed the army on the streets during the curfew that was imposed from midnight on Saturday.The government said curfew restrictions would be relaxed for seven hours on Wednesday and Thursday, and offices would also be open from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.Analysts say the student action has given fresh impetus to Hasina's critics, months after she won a fourth-straight term in power in January in a national election boycotted by the main opposition party.""The informal federation of government critics appears deeper and wider than before the election, which presents a serious challenge to the ruling party,"" said Geoffrey Macdonald at the United States Institute of Peace.Hasina, 76, is the daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founding father of Bangladesh, who led the country's movement for independence from Pakistan.The earlier 56% job quotas included a 30% reservation for families of veterans of the 1971 independence war, which critics said favoured supporters of Hasina's Awami League.Hasina's government had scrapped the quotas in 2018, but a high court ruling reinstated the them last month.Students were furious because quotas left fewer than half of state jobs open on merit amid an unemployment crisis, particularly in the private sector, making government sector jobs with their regular wage hikes and perks especially prized.Hasina has blamed her political opponents for the violence and her government said on Tuesday that it would heed the Supreme Court ruling.The main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party has denied any involvement in the violence and accused Hasina of authoritarianism and a crackdown on her critics, charges denied by her government.Protesting students have given the government a fresh 48-hour ultimatum to fulfil four other conditions of an eight-point list of demands, and said they would announce their next steps on Thursday.""We want the government to meet our four-point demand, including restoration of internet, withdrawal of police from campuses, and opening universities (which have been closed for a week),"" protest coordinator Nahid Islam said.",Bangladesh's mainstay garment and textiles industries also began reopening some factories after a pause in production during the curfew.

'Forced' cremations of Covid-19 victims: Sri Lanka issue apology to Muslim community,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/forced-cremations-of-covid-19-victims-sri-lanka-issue-apology-to-muslim-community/articleshow/111979363.cms,"Sri Lanka 's government formally apologised to the island's Muslim minority on Tuesday for its controversial policy of forcing cremations on COVID-19 victims , despite assurances from the World Health Organisation (WHO) that burials in accordance with Islamic rites were safe.The cabinet issued a statement of apology regarding the compulsory cremation policy implemented during the pandemic.The government also announced plans to introduce a new law that will guarantee the right to either burial or cremation, ensuring that the funeral customs of Muslims and other communities are respected in the future.In Islamic tradition, Muslims bury their dead facing Mecca, while Sri Lanka's majority buddhists and hindus are typically cremated. The government's previous policy had required the cremation of COVID-19 victims, which clashed with the religious practices of the Muslim community .Representatives of Sri Lanka’s Muslim community welcomed the apology but expressed that the entire community remains traumatised by the experience. ""We will now sue two academics, Meththika Vithanage and Channa Jayasumana, who were behind the forced cremation policy of the government,"" said Hilmy Ahamed, spokesman for the Muslim Council of Sri Lanka, as quoted by AFP. ""We will also seek compensation.""Ahamed recounted the distress of a young Muslim couple who endured severe emotional trauma when their 40-day-old infant was cremated by the state against their wishes.Former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa had banned burials despite facing international condemnation from the UN Human Rights Council and other forums for violating Muslim funeral practices. In a book published earlier this month, Rajapaksa defended his actions by citing ""expert advice"" from Vithanage, a professor of natural resources, on the risks of interring COVID-19 victims, despite her lack of medical expertise.Rajapaksa's forced cremation policy was halted in February 2021 following an appeal from then-Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan during a visit to Sri Lanka. After the policy's revocation, burials were permitted in the remote Oddamavadi area in the island's east under strict military supervision, though bereaved families were not allowed to participate in the burial process.Rajapaksa was ousted from office two years ago amid widespread protests over an unprecedented economic crisis that led to severe shortages of food, fuel, and medicines.","Sri Lanka's government formally apologised to the island's Muslim minority for its controversial policy of forcing cremations on COVID-19 victims.
