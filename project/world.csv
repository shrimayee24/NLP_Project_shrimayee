DEHRADUN: A traders ’ body in Uttarakhand ’s Khansar town in Chamoli district, around 260km from Dehradun, has “passed a resolution” asking about 15 Muslim families to leave the town by Dec 31. Some of them have been in Chamoli for decades.The resolution was passed on Wednesday during a meeting of the vyapar mandal, following a ‘chetna’ (awareness) rally in Maithan market of Khansar on the same day.TOI has accessed a video of the rally in which the participants, mostly local traders, could be purportedly seen raising provocative slogans.Former traders’ body president Virendra Singh, who is now president of Maithan Seva Samiti, told TOI the resolution was passed “unanimously” as “preventive action.”A meeting of the vyapar mandal in Uttarakhand’s Khansar town in Chamoli Wednesday passed a resolution asking Muslim families to leave the town by Dec 31.Virendra Singh, president of Maithan Seva Samiti, told TOI, “During the meeting, it was decided that all such families should leave before Dec 31. Failing to do so will attract legal and punitive action not only against these families but also against those who rent out their houses or establishments to them. Such landlords will also face a penalty of Rs 10,000.”Singh added, “Moreover, it has been decided to prohibit all hawkers from entering villages in Khansar valley. Any hawker caught doing business will face a penalty of Rs 10,000 and legal action.

New footage captures Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar throwing stick at drone before being killed by Israel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/new-footage-captures-hamas-chief-yahya-sinwar-throwing-stick-at-drone-before-being-killed-by-israel/articleshow/114344358.cms,"Yahya Sinwar's Video Fighting Israeli Military Before His Death Out | Last Moments On IDF Cam

Footage released by the Israeli Defence Forces reveals Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar making a last-ditch attempt to save his life just moments before he was killed. In the footage, Sinwar who was one of the key faces behind the October 7 attack, could be seen throwing a stick at an Israeli drone moments before he was killed in southern Gaza . The video showed Sinwar slumped in a chair, covered in dust, as the drone hovered nearby.The video emerged following a year-long manhunt that concluded with a gun battle on Wednesday.Israeli forces initially did not realise they had located Sinwar. As Israeli military officials detailed, the operation that led to his demise was not a planned airstrike, but rather an engagement by infantry soldiers from the Bislach Brigade, who were operating in the Tal El Sultan area, where they believed senior Hamas members were present.During the encounter, the troops engaged three suspected militants, prompting a firefight that forced Sinwar into a derelict building. Israeli forces subsequently targeted the structure with tank shells and a missile. In the aftermath, the drone footage revealed Sinwar, wounded and dishevelled, as he futilely attempted to knock down the drone with a stick. Initial identification of Sinwar as a combatant was confirmed later through dental records and DNA testing.Hamas has yet to officially respond to Sinwar's death, but sources within the group have acknowledged its likelihood. The Israeli military highlighted that extensive operations conducted over the past year had severely limited Sinwar’s movement, forcing him into increasingly desperate measures. In his final days, he reportedly ceased using telephones, believing this would aid in evading Israeli intelligence.Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi, head of Israel's military, noted that Sinwar's actions reflected a fugitive's lifestyle, as he changed locations frequently. While there were concerns he might use hostages as human shields, no captives were found in the vicinity during the operation.","Yahya Sinwar was one of the key faces behind the October 7 attack.

A look at Media bias and player support



Tyreek Hill Arrest Bodycam is MUCH Worse Than You May Have Thought...

What occurred with the police officers involved in Tyreek Hill's arrest?



The NFL is no stranger to controversy, but recent incidents have cast a shadow over the league. Just as Tyreek Hill made headlines for his arrest on the way to the season opener, former quarterback Jay Cutler was charged with possession of a handgun and DUI in Franklin, Tennessee. With the spotlight on both an active player and a retired legend, the NFL faces the repercussions of these troubling events.Let’s delve into the details surrounding Cutler’s arrest and the reactions that have followed.Also Read: Kamala Harris finally addresses Taylor Swift’s support following Donald Trump’s criticism of Travis Kelce The NFL has been shaken by ongoing run-ins with law enforcement. Recently, Tyreek Hill was arrested en route to the season opener, and now former quarterback Jay Cutler faces charges in Franklin, Tennessee for possession of a handgun and DUI. He’s also hit with two additional charges: failure to exercise due care and violation of implied consent.In the wake of Hill's arrest, he received backing from teammates and fans. He’s now calling out media hypocrisy, referencing Cutler’s arrest and posting on X (formerly Twitter), “I don’t see no media outlets talking about what just happened with former QB.”While Hill remains an active player in the NFL and was headed to a game during his incident, Cutler retired seven years ago in 2017. Though Cutler’s arrest initially flew under the radar, it quickly gained traction across media outlets once it became public. Here’s what we know about the situation.On the evening of October 17th, Franklin Police stopped the former Dolphins quarterback for a check and found him driving under the influence. He was booked at Williamson County Jail at 6:50 PM CDT, but it’s unclear if his arrest involved violence like Tyreek Hill’s.After spending about three hours in custody, he posted a $5,000 bond and was released at 9:59 PM CDT. In his mugshot, the NFL legend appeared tired and disheveled. As of now, he has not made any public comments regarding his arrest, and more details are still pending. In contrast, Tyreek Hill was under the public spotlight, with many supporters rallying around him.On his way to the Jaguars opener in his McLaren 720S, Tyreek Hill was stopped and arrested by Miami Dade County officials. He was later released, scored a touchdown, and celebrated in a handcuffed pose, but body cam footage revealed the aggressive nature of his arrest. Officer Manuel Batista initiated the stop, leading to a confrontation with Hill, while Officer Danny Torres handcuffed him. The backlash resulted in Torres being placed on administrative leave, having been suspended six times in 27 years. In the post-game conference, Hill questioned the police misconduct , asking, “What if I wasn’t Tyreek Hill?” While tensions have eased, his remarks highlight how active players often garner more headlines than retired legends. We’ll keep reporting on players, both current and former, to provide fans with insights.Also Read: Patrick Mahomes' mom Randi reflects on 19 years of bonding as she copes with her husband’s health challenges","The NFL has been shaken by ongoing run-ins with law enforcement.

NEW DELHI: Police in Pakistan used tear gas and batons to disperse student protesters on Thursday after they ransacked a college building. The protests erupted over an alleged on-campus rape in Lahore that has sparked anger and demonstrations in four cities.Reports of the incident spread on social media, increasing tensions on college campuses. Students in Rawalpindi, Punjab province, burned furniture and blocked a key road before vandalizing a college building.Earlier, a security guard died during clashes between student protesters and police in Gujrat, also in Punjab province. Authorities arrested one person related to the guard's death and another for spreading misinformation about the alleged rape.In Lahore, over two dozen students were injured earlier this week while demanding justice for the alleged victim, who students claim was raped at the Punjab Group of Colleges.In response to the growing unrest, the government banned rallies in Punjab. The Federal Investigation Agency filed cases against 36 people accused of spreading misinformation on social media.Authorities, including the Punjab chief minister, and the woman’s parents denied any assault happened. However, Punjab police called on the public to share any information regarding the alleged rape.The unrest seems to have started spontaneously, as student unions in Pakistan have been banned since 1984.These protests also come after a woman reported being gang-raped during a polio vaccination drive in Sindh province last month. Police arrested three men involved, but the woman's husband expelled her from home, citing damage to the family name.","Protests erupted over an alleged on-campus rape in Lahore that has sparked anger.

North Korea claims it discovered the remains of a South Korean drone in its capital,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/north-korea-claims-it-discovered-the-remains-of-a-south-korean-drone-in-its-capital/articleshow/114364942.cms,"North Korea claims it discovered the remains of a South Korean drone in its capital (KCNA photo via AP)

SEOUL: North Korea said Saturday it found the remains of a South Korean drone during a search in its capital, Pyongyang , claiming the drone proved the South’s military was behind the alleged drone infiltrations over the city’s skies earlier in the month.South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff in a statement described the North Korean claim as “unilateral” and “unworthy of responding.”The North’s official Korean Central News Agency released photos showing a seemingly damaged aircraft with wide, V-shaped wings and winglets.It said a joint investigation by North Korea’s military and state security agencies concluded that the aircraft, which it said was found on Oct. 13, was the same type of drone that appeared in a South Korean military parade earlier in October.North Korea accused South Korea of flying drones over the night skies of Pyongyang three different times this month to drop anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets. It threatened to respond with force if such flights occur again.The aircraft allegedly found in Pyongyang was likely one of the drones that were used to drop leaflets, North Korea’s Defense Ministry said, but further examinations were needed to verify that.Should South Korea deny that the aircraft was used to drop leaflets, that would only confess to a separate infiltration of North Korea’s airspace by the South’s military, the ministry said. If North Korea confirms another violation of its territorial ground, airspace and waters by the South’s military, that will be regarded as a “declaration of war and an immediate retaliatory attack will be launched,” the ministry added.South Korea’s defense minister initially made a vague denial after the North's Oct. 11 accusation that the South sent drones over Pyongyang. The South’s military adjusted its response hours later, saying it couldn’t confirm whether or not the North’s claims were true.Tensions on the Korean Peninsula are now at their worst in years as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ramps up his weapons tests and threats, and expands military cooperation with Russia, with South Korea claiming the North dispatched troops to support Russia’s war against Ukraine.The animosity has been exacerbated by Cold War-style psychological warfare campaigns between the Koreas in recent months.Since May, North Korea has sent thousands of balloons carrying paper waste, plastic and other trash to drop on the South. The South’s military has responded by using loudspeakers at the border to broadcast propaganda and K-pop to North Korea.North Korea is extremely sensitive to any outside criticism of Kim’s authoritarian government and his family’s dynastic rule.","North Korea claims it found the remains of a South Korean drone during a search in its capital, Pyongyang.

The cabinet shuffle is not expected to happen imminently and could even wait until after the US polls, according to officials.Other ministers have already stepped down from Trudeau’s cabinet. In the past few months, Seamus O’Regan quit his job as labour minister as he didn’t intend to run again and Pablo Rodriguez left as transport minister in order to run for the leadership of Quebec’s provincial Liberal party. Trudeau is under pressure to show his caucus a plan to erode the dominant polling lead enjoyed by Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre , who’s been ahead by around 20 percentage points for over a year now.There have been reports over past week that some Liberal lawmakers intend to challenge Trudeau at next week’s caucus meeting, either calling on him to resign as leader or to make a bigger shakeup in the people around him.","The four ministers expected to leave cabinet — Carla Qualtrough, MarieClaude Bibeau, Dan Vandal and Filomena Tassi — are not in major portfolios.

Democrat presidential nominee and vice president Kamala Harris highlighted concerns regarding 78-year-old Donald Trump and his physical stamina to serve as president during her campaign in Michigan on Friday.""It should be a concern. If he can't handle the rigours of the campaign trail, is he fit to do the job?"" she asked reporters before a rally in Grand Rapids. The question arose particularly after reports indicated he skipped interviews due to fatigue and opted out of a second debate with her.In response, Trump rejected the allegations, saying, ""I've gone 48 days now without a rest.I'm not even tired. I'm really exhilarated. You know why? We're killing her in the polls."" He pointed to polls in competitive states showing the race effectively tied.On Thursday, Harris accused Trump of 'gaslighting' the American people about the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack by Trump supporters. Trump recently called the attack 'a day of love' during his Univision town hall.Seeking support from Arab Americans in Michigan disappointed with Democrats, Trump visited a campaign office in Hamtramck. Where the city's first Muslim mayor, Amer Ghalib praised him for his efforts. Trump emphasised on the need for peace in the Middle East, asserting that it could be achieved quickly with the right leadership.""We all ultimately want one thing. We want peace in the Middle East. We're going to get peace in the Middle East. It's going to happen very fast. It can happen with the right leadership in Washington,"" he said.Later, Trump held a rally in Detroit, the largest city in Michigan, where he reiterated his Detroit statement, he claimed that the US would resemble Detroit if Harris won.Meanwhile, Harris continued her campaign across Michigan, targeting the state's Arab-American, senior, union, and working-class voters.Harris has shifted her strategy to appeal to more Republicans and men, by enlisting former first lady Michelle Obama to join her campaign efforts in Michigan on October 26.Recent public and internal polls show extremely narrow margins for both candidates in Michigan, a crucial battleground state with 15 Electoral College votes.","Kamala Harris questions Donald Trump's physical stamina to serve as president.

Former US President and Republican nominee Donald Trump faced technical issues during a rally in Detroit on Friday night when his microphone cut out, leaving him to pace the stage in silence for almost 20 minutes.He was prepared to discuss tariffs in his poll rally, the sound unexpectedly failed, halting his speech.Visibly frustrated, Trump wandered the stage while the crowd chanted ""USA"" and ""We love Trump"" in support.The event’s screens displayed messages of "" Technical Difficulties "" and ""Complicated Business"" as Trump waited for a solution.An aide eventually provided a new microphone, allowing him to resume his speech, during which he jokingly said, ""Now what happens is I won't pay the bill for this stupid company that rented us this crap. I won't pay the bill""The malfunction marks the second time in a week that one of Trump’s events was interrupted. Earlier in the week, he ended a town hall early due to medical emergencies in the crowd.Prior to the microphone mishap, Trump attacked his Democratic opponent as ""grossly incompetent"" and vowed to ""save"" Detroit, as Vice President Kamala Harris campaigned in Oakland County. The latest polls show Trump and his opponent tied in the key swing state of Michigan.Meanwhile, Trump continued his attacks on legal challenges against him, calling Judge Tanya Chutkan ""the most evil person"" and special counsel Jack Smith a ""sick puppy,"" in response to the latest developments in the January 6 case.The Harris campaign seized on the moment, posting on X that Trump appeared ""exhausted"" as he paced the stage, using the incident to question his fitness for office.","Former US President and Republican nominee Donald Trump faced technical issues during a rally in Detroit on Friday night.

Like Epstein's list, a list of names, all celebrities, with links to P Diddy and his Freak sessions, are doing the rounds on social media.The alleged list contains names of Leonardo Dicaprio , Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Ashton Kutcher, Paris Hilton, Howard Stern, Russell Brand, Mariah Carey, Jennifer Lopez, Russell Simmons, Usher, Meghan Fox. The list goes viral as Usher, Pink deleted their X posts and theories that Justin Bieber might have been a victim of Diddy float around.Nobody has been implicated in the Sean Combs case so far.P Diddy is facing serious charges of sex trafficking and racketeering where he forced women to have sex with male prostitutes that continued for days as the entire action was caught on camera. Huge stocks of baby oil, drugs were found at Diddy's sex den while Diddy did not plead guilty to the charges.Usher who once stayed with Diddy said his X account got hacked and that's why all his past posts disappeared. This happened as his old statement in which said he witnessed wild things when he stayed with Diddy resurfaced.Apart from Usher and Pink, Megan Fox deleted all her posts on Instagram and X triggering speculations over how she was linked to Diddy.An old snipped of Khloe Kardashian claiming that she attended one of Diddy's naked parties emerged. ""I got on a plane at 5:30 am. Well this party...I think half the people there were butt naked,"" this is exactly what Khloe said about Diddy's party.Diddy was Justin Bieber's mentor but Bieber's spokesperson said he is trying not to focus on the charges and accusation of Diddy. Justin is in a happy bubble since he became a father.As the list of the Hollywood A-listers becomes long, they are maintaining absolute silence over Diddy's arrest.An officer involved in the raid on Diddy's home compared him to Jeffrey Epstein, stating that Diddy was part of the same social circle as Epstein and Harvey Weinstein. The officer claimed there were 15 years of wild parties, suggesting that while not everyone who attended was complicit in trafficking, they witnessed inappropriate behavior. He emphasized that many people knew what went on, especially as things became more explicit late at night.Also read on the Diddy case:","No Hollywood A-lister has been implicated in the Sean Diddy trafficking case but several 'Diddy lists' are viral.

Who was Yahya Sinwar?

Born in 1962 in a refugee camp in Khan Younis, Gaza.

A founding member of Hamas, joining the group in 1987.

Nicknamed “The Butcher of Khan Younis” for his role in killing suspected collaborators.

Arrested by Israel in the late 1980s, he was sentenced to four life terms but was released in 2011 as part of a prisoner exchange.

Became the head of Hamas in Gaza, working closely with Iran to bolster the group’s military power.

Was instrumental in the October 7 attack on Israel that triggered the ongoing conflict.

Yahya Sinwar's Last Message To Israel On Al-Aqsa Mosque | His Rise From Israeli Jails To Gaza

Israel said on Thursday that it had successfully killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar , a key figure behind the 7 October attack on Israel. His body was discovered among the rubble in Gaza, where Israeli forces had unknowingly come across him during a battle in Rafah. His identity was later confirmed through DNA, dental records, and fingerprints.Sinwar's remains were reportedly found with a bulletproof vest, grenades, and 40,000 shekels, according to Israeli military officials.Footage released by the Israeli military shows Sinwar’s final moments, captured by a drone deployed to survey the area. The footage showed the Hamas leader, visibly injured, attempting to throw a piece of wood at the drone in a desperate attempt to avoid detection. Moments later, another strike on the building caused it to collapse, killing Sinwar and two other militants.Sinwar’s involvement in the 7 October attack, which left over 1,200 people dead and resulted in the kidnapping of around 250 Israelis, made him one of Israel’s most-wanted individuals. He played a crucial role in orchestrating the surprise assault that triggered the current conflict between Israel and Hamas.His death is being celebrated by Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , who described it as a major victory against Hamas.Netanyahu said, “Hamas will no longer rule Gaza. This is the start of the day after Hamas,” reinforcing Israel’s commitment to continue its military campaign until all hostages are released and Hamas is fully dismantled. Defence minister Yoav Gallant urged Hamas fighters to surrender and release the remaining hostages.While Israel sees Sinwar’s death as a turning point, Hamas has not yet confirmed the loss of its leader.","Yahya Sinwar was a key figure behind the 7 October attack on Israel.

TOI Correspondent from London

: US Republicans have accused Britain of foreign interference in their elections after it emerged that 100 former and current Labour party members have gone to the US to campaign for Kamala Harris A LinkedIn post by Sofia Patel, head of operations at the Labour party, was widely circulated on Thursday. She wrote: “I have nearly 100 Labour Party staff (current and former) going to the US in the next few weeks heading to North Carolina, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Virginia.I have 10 spots available for anyone to head to the battleground state of North Carolina — we will sort your housing.” She then provided her email address as labourforkamala@gmail.com and asked people to email her if they are interested.An earlier post by her, in Aug, stated: “I’m planning a trip for Labour party staff to help our friends across the pond elect their first female president. If you worked for the Labour party during the general election, have now left, but are interested, please drop me an email to my work address. I will be going for the final two weeks of the election. Let’s show the Democrats how to win election!”Patel’s entire LinkedIn account has now been deleted.TOI’s own enquiries have found the posts did exist and these Labour party staff have gone to the US to campaign for the Democratic nominee.Republican politician Marjorie Taylor Greene said that Labour was breaking Federal Election Commission laws. “Foreign nationals are not allowed to be involved in anyway in US elections . Please go back to the UK and fix your own mass immigration problems that are ruining your country,” she wrote on X.Leader of Reform UK Nigel Farage said: “This is direct election interference by the governing Labour Party, and particularly stupid if Trump wins. Who is paying for all of this?”Former UK PM Liz Truss wrote on X: “President Trump is definitely going to win now”, whilst Elon Musk branded it as “illegal” and Conservative activist Robby Starbuck branded it as “foreign election interference”. ""Now you know why they invented Russia collusion,” he said.It is understood that the trips to the US are for individuals in a personal capacity, funded by themselves and on their own time. They are not organised or funded by the Labour party. The accommodation is being arranged by volunteers campaigning for the Democrats.The Federal Election Commission directed TOI to its website, which states: “Although foreign nationals may not make contributions or expenditures in connection with any federal, state or local election, an individual who is a foreign national may participate in campaign activities as an uncompensated volunteer. In doing so, the volunteer must be careful not to participate in the decision-making process of the campaign.”On Sept 29, Labour MP Ruth Cadbury posted a photo of herself on X campaigning in New Hampshire with the Harris-Walz team. She wrote: “I’ve taken myself to do my bit to stop Trump winning. Door-knocking yesterday with the #HarrisWalz team in (swing state) New Hampshire, along with State Senate candidate Wayne Haubner.” Sam Forster, who works in regional comms for Labour, posted a photo of himself holding Harris-Jacky Rosen flyers on 10 Oct and wrote: “What happens when two Labour staffers go on holiday to a swing state?”","100 former and current Labour party members have gone to the US to campaign for Kamala Harris.

The state called the ad ""false,"" and at least one station stopped airing it after receiving the department's letter.Lauren Brenzel, the director of the ""Yes on 4"" campaign, praised the court's decision, calling it ""a triumph for every Floridian who believes in democracy and the sanctity of the First Amendment."" She emphasized that the government cannot silence the truth about Florida's extreme abortion ban.Governor Ron DeSantis has pledged to defeat Amendment 4 and has used state power to oppose the measure, leading to several legal challenges. While courts had previously declined to intervene, Judge Walker's order was met with criticism from the governor's office. Julia Friedland, Mr. DeSantis's deputy press secretary, claimed that the ads are false and put the lives and health of pregnant women at risk, asserting that Florida's heartbeat protection law always protects the life of a mother and includes exceptions for victims of rape, incest, and human trafficking.The campaign is seeking a preliminary injunction against the state, with a hearing scheduled for Oct. 29. A separate lawsuit, filed by opponents of Amendment 4 and seeking to remove the measure from the ballot, is currently pending in state court.","A federal court on Thursday ordered a Ron DeSantis led Florida administration to stop threatening television stations with criminal prosecution for airing a political ad in favor of enshrining abortion rights in the state's Constitution.

Donald Trump Health: 'Overweight...never smoker': 5 things to know about Donald Trump's health,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/overweight-never-smoker-5-things-to-know-about-donald-trumps-health/articleshow/114358355.cms,"Donald Trump's health: Here is what we know

Former White House physician Jeffrey Kuhlman told Axios that Donald Trump never smoked but he is overweight. He said Trump appears to be in good health for his age but raised concerns about his cognitive ability for critical decision making. Kuhlman never examined Donald Trump. Donald Trump is 6 feet 3 inches tall, according to records. His weight is 244 pounds (110 kg). He is medically obese. However, there are many records of Trump's height and weight. He self-reported his weight as 215 pounds (97.5 kg) in 2020. Another record from 2018 said his weight was 239 pounds (108 kg). In 2018, it was revealed that he had high cholesterol which dropped by 2020, Axios reported. Trump has parental history of dementia as his father Fred Trump was diagnosed with dementia in 1991 when he was 86. Fred was later found to have Alzheimer's disease. In 2018, it was reported that Trump had a common form of heart disease which was easy to address if he increased the dose of his cholesterol-lowering medication. This was diagnosed by the Mayo Clinic.

Former president Donald Trump who will be the oldest president in history to be inaugurated if he wins the election has not revealed his detailed medical report -- a ground on which the Kamala Harris campaign has upped its attack on the GOP. Vice president Kamala Harris released her full health record where she had been deemed as fit to be the president. The vice president asked her opponent to do the same and questioned his mental agility as there are only three weeks left for the election.Donald Trump is 78-year-old and his team has Kennedy Jr who wants to Make America Healthy Again.Trump boasts of doing well as a cognitive test though it is not certain which one he speaks about. In 2018, he was given the Montreal Cognitive Assessment under Dr Ronny Jackson and he had a perfect score of 30 out of 30, according to reports.",Former White House physician Jeffrey Kuhlman told Axios that Donald Trump never smoked but he is overweight.

Donald Trump: US Presidential Election Top 10: Is Trump the orator back from the dead?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-al-smith-dinner-orator/articleshow/114357736.cms,"After the only debate between Trump and Harris, this author had argued that Donald Trump, the orator, was finished. Yours truly had argued: “It became apparent to all viewers – whether MAGA supporters or members of the K-Hive – that the Donald Trump of old was gone, as the verve and vivacity that once made Trump such an avant-garde speaker with his stream-of-consciousness style were missing.Perhaps this is why he avoided the Republican primaries, where Vivek Ramaswamy stood out as his surrogate and attack dog. Before the Harris debate, Trump claimed: ‘Donald Trump is probably the greatest political debater we’ve ever had in American history.’ Reality begged to differ.”However, it would appear that the old powers have returned, perhaps bolstered by his improved performance in polls that is inversely proportional to Kamala Harris ’s interviews. Or, to put it in Catholic terms: Trump, the orator, has risen again.At the Al Smith Dinner – held in honour of the first Catholic presidential nominee – it was vintage Donald Trump. The Trump of yore that chewed up the entire Republican nominees before the 2016 election, weaving like James Joyce and spitting like Eminem.Trump was the best comedian on stage, which is saying something given the fact that MC Jim Gaffigan , who plays Tim Walz on SNL, was in top form, mocking the Democrats for being so concerned for democracy that they staged a coup to remove Biden and wondered why Harris was missing the most important Catholic dinner (22% of Americans identify as Catholic) but had time to attend the coitus-obsessed Call Her Daddy Podcast.Trump had a joke for everyone.For New York Mayor Eric Adams, he told him to stay strong before pointing out that for a vegan, he loved turkey too much. He praised the powers of prayer, stating that sometimes it took “three-and-a-half years” and a George Clooney op-ed. He poked fun at White Dudes for Harris, stating that their wives and their wives’ lovers would be voting for him. He pointed out his normal audience was a lot younger and had more energy, but this crowd had more cash, echoing George W. Bush’s iconic comment that the audience was a collection of “haves and have lots,” his base.He even cracked a joke about loving being anywhere in New York without a subpoena, jested with Chuck Schumer that his party was so woke that he could still be the first female President if Kamala lost, and said that Tim Walz was missing but would still say he was there. He kidded that there was no point in making self-deprecating jokes about himself given other people were already shooting at him.Piers Morgan, who had earned the ire of the MAGA crowd by saying Harris won the debate comfortably, praised Trump, saying: “This speech was absolutely hilarious. Trump at his funniest and most entertaining. And the fact Kamala ducked the event was cowardly and a massive mistake.” It was objectively funnier than most late-night comedy shows. The only ones who were displeased were mainstream media. The BBC actually had a heading that said: “Trump and Harris roast each other for charity event...” The pre-recorded video that Harris gave, with Molly Shannon playing her SNL character Marty Katherine Gallagher, was barely a skit, let alone a roast. The Harris campaign released a statement claiming “he struggled to read and lashed out at the crowd,” a claim that will be seen as objectively false to anyone who watched the entire thing and doesn’t suffer from Trump Derangement Syndrome.The last Presidential nominee to miss the event was Walter Mondale , who managed to lose every state except Minnesota and Washington DC against Nixon in 1984, the most lopsided election result in American history, giving us a map that could’ve been called Red Red Redemption.Currently, Harris is stuck in what Silicon Valley BC David Sacks called an “interview Doom Loop.” He had argued: “She’s going to have to abandon this basement strategy of not doing interviews. The problem is, she’s not good at interviews. And if she does more interviews, she’s going to fall further behind in the polls, and it could cause a doom loop.” Since Harris started giving interviews, first with Walz, and then solo, her gap has decreased from 3.5 to 2.4 (538 poll of polls). The fact is that, at this moment, things are looking more up for Trump compared to Harris, who is clawing away at the post-debate gains. The return of Trump, the orator, could be further bad news.Also read: Top 10 stories","The Donald Trump of old was gone, as the verve and vivacity that once made Trump such an avant-garde speaker with his stream-of-consciousness style were missing.

Pakistan's Punjab CM blames PTI party

Senior directors of a Pakistan college stated on Wednesday that there was no evidence to support claims of a student being raped on campus, despite reports circulating online that led to several days of protests. The allegations, which spread through social media posts, claimed that a woman was raped in the basement of a Punjab College for Women campus in Lahore .In response to the posts, hundreds of students, mostly male, engaged in protests that involved smashing windows and burning school buses. These demonstrations reflect a growing concern in Pakistan regarding safety, harassment, and sexual violence.Arif Chaudry, the Lahore director of the private Punjab Group of Colleges , which operates the women's college, was quoted by AFP during a press conference saying, ""The incident does not exist. I will resign and I will leave this profession and stand with the students if the incident took place.""Another director of the group, Agha Tahir Ijaz, urged students not to believe misinformation during the same news conference.As the anger grew over the alleged incident, police arrested a security guard who was identified in the online posts. However, they reported that no victim had come forward and that they were unable to verify the incident.The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) cybercrime wing has initiated an investigation targeting individuals responsible for disseminating the information via social media channels which is now claimed to be false.The protests, which began at two of the college's campuses on Monday afternoon, quickly spread to several other colleges throughout the city and continued for three days and resulted in injuries to at least 28 people.As the college denied the claims, Maryam Nawaz , the chief minister of Pakistan's Punjab also addressed the alleged rape incident, asserting that the accusations were 'fabricated'.Nawaz further claimed that the political party led by Imran Khan , Pakistan's former prime minister who is currently imprisoned, exploited the false allegation to provoke extensive student demonstrations and cause instability throughout the province.The Punjab government has closed the college campus where the alleged rape was said to have occurred until further notice. ""On social media, a factory of lies is running. PTI's politics have sunk so low that it is exploiting tragedies for political gain,"" Maryam said while warning that those responsible for spreading the false posts would face punishment. Addressing PTI founder Imran Khan, the CM added, ""If politics stoops to such levels of inhumanity, then you deserve to be where you are.""

Li is likely to virtually inaugurate the CPEC-funded airport in the southwestern province, bordering Afghanistan and Iran.Neither side commented on the reason for a virtual inauguration, but sources cited heightened security concerns following the recent Karachi attack for Li being advised against travelling to a restive region.Islamabad, too, has sought to temporarily curb the movements of Chinese nationals in the country, citing fears of violence from armed groups. Officials said the Karachi blast is likely to figure in talks between Li and his Pakistani counterpart.“We will review progress on existing initiatives, especially the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ), and also explore new avenues of mutually beneficial cooperation. The Pakistan-China all-weather strategic cooperative partnership is the cornerstone of regional stability and prosperity,” Shehbaz wrote on X.According to the foreign office, Li will also call on President Asif Ali Zardari and hold meetings with parliamentary members and the senior military leadership.The two-day SCO meeting starts Tuesday in Islamabad.
