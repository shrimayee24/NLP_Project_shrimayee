Assault by bouncers? Actor-politician & TVK chief Vijay booked in manhandling case during rally in Perambalur; case registered under three sections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/assault-by-bouncers-actor-politician-tvk-chief-vijay-booked-in-manhandling-case-during-rally-in-perambalur-case-registered-under-three-setions/articleshow/123537332.cms,"NEW DELHI: Police in Kunnam have registered a case against actor-politician and Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) chief Thalapathy Vijay along with his bouncers following a complaint of alleged assault.According to officials, the case was filed based on a complaint submitted by Sarathkumar at the Perambalur District Superintendent of Police office. He alleged that he was manhandled by Vijay’s bouncers during an incident.Kunnam Police said a case has been registered against Vijay and his security staff under three sections of the Indian Penal Code.The development comes as Vijay, who founded TVK in 2024, seeks to position himself as a major challenger in Tamil Nadu politics. Earlier this month, the actor-politician declared that he would contest the 2026 assembly elections from Madurai East, making his most direct pitch yet to take on the ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK).At the party’s second state conference in Madurai, Vijay launched a fiery attack on the DMK, calling it his main political rival while identifying the Bharatiya Janata Party as TVK’s “only ideological enemy.”Drawing loud cheers from thousands of supporters, he declared, “TVK is not a political game; it is an ideology. This is not a speech for publicity. This is a warning to those who are in power. TVK is here to dominate. Crores of people are with us. The 2026 election is a fight between TVK and DMK.”Vijay has sought to frame TVK as a clean, uncompromising force. “TVK is not a party that makes underground deals, forges alliances, and cheats the people. We are not afraid of anyone. The people of Tamil Nadu, the women and the youth stand with us,” he said. At the rally, he also promised to “free Katchatheevu island from Sri Lanka” and ensure the safety of Tamil Nadu fishermen, a long-standing political demand in the state.His recent political events have drawn massive crowds, underlining his appeal beyond the silver screen. The Madurai rally was billed as TVK’s biggest mobilisation yet, echoing historic elections of 1967 and 1977 when new parties under CN Annadurai and MG Ramachandran rose to power. Vijay, however, enters politics as a newcomer despite his two-decade-long popularity as a film icon.The actor-turned-politician has also been sharpening his criticism of chief minister MK Stalin’s DMK government. On social media, he condemned the arrest of protesting sanitation workers in Chennai as “fascist” and “inhumane.” He has repeatedly attacked both state and central governments on issues such as custodial deaths and the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET), demanding its abolition. “Revoke NEET! Can you do it, Narendra Modi avargal?” he asked, directly addressing the Prime Minister.Even as his rallies have showcased TVK’s growing strength, they have not been without setbacks. At the recent Madurai conference, a 33-year-old party worker from Chennai, Prabhakaran, collapsed and died on his way to the event, casting a shadow over the gathering.",Police in Kunnam have registered a case against actor-politician and Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) chief Thalapathy Vijay. The case was filed based on a complaint submitted by Sarathkumar at the Perambalur District Superintendent of Police office. He alleged that he was manhandled by Vijay's bouncers during an incident.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123537371,imgsize-563133,width-400,resizemode-4/123537371.jpg"
SCO summit: PM Modi to be in China after 7 years; Xi Jinping to host over 20 world leaders including Vladimir Putin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sco-summit-pm-modi-to-be-in-china-after-7-years-xi-jinping-to-host-over-20-world-leaders-inculding-putin/articleshow/123537009.cms,"NEW DELHI: Chinese President Xi Jinping will host more than 20 world leaders at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin next week, in what analysts describe as a show of Global South solidarity and diplomatic support for Russia.According to a Reuters report, the summit, scheduled for August 31 to September 1, will be attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and leaders from Central Asia, the Middle East, South Asia, and Southeast Asia.The gathering will mark PM Modi’s first visit to China in over seven years as both countries continue efforts to ease tensions following deadly border clashes in 2020. PM Modi last shared the stage with Xi and Putin during the Brics summit in Kazan, Russia, even as Western leaders distanced themselves from the Russian president over the war in Ukraine.Russian officials in New Delhi said Moscow hopes trilateral talks involving India and China will take place soon.""Xi will want to use the summit as an opportunity to showcase what a post-American-led international order begins to look like and that all White House efforts since January to counter China, Iran, Russia, and now India have not had the intended effect,"" said Eric Olander, editor-in-chief of The China-Global South Project.""Just look at how much Brics has rattled (US President) Donald Trump, which is precisely what these groups are designed to do. ""Chinese officials said this year’s summit will be the largest since the SCO’s founding in 2001, calling the bloc an ""important force in building a new type of international relations."" Initially set up by six Eurasian nations to focus on security, the SCO has since expanded to 10 permanent members and 16 dialogue and observer states, extending its agenda to economic and military cooperation.Analysts note, however, that the bloc’s outcomes have often been limited. ""What is the precise vision that the SCO represents and its practical implementation are rather fuzzy. It is a platform that has increasing convening power, which helps in narrative projection,"" said Manoj Kewalramani of the Takshashila Institution in Bangalore. ""But the SCO's effectiveness in addressing substantial security issues remains very limited. ""Frictions persist among members, especially India and Pakistan. The June SCO defence ministers’ meeting failed to adopt a joint statement after India objected to the omission of a reference to the April 22 terror attack on Hindu pilgrims in Kashmir. New Delhi also refused to endorse the bloc’s condemnation of Israeli strikes on Iran earlier this year.Still, experts say geopolitical shifts are pushing India and China towards dialogue. The easing of border tensions and renewed tariff pressures on New Delhi from the Trump administration are fuelling expectations of a constructive meeting between Xi and PM Modi. ""It's likely (New Delhi) will swallow their pride and put this year's SCO problems behind them in a bid to maintain momentum in the détente with China, which is a key Modi priority right now,"" Olander added.Indian foreign ministry official Tanmaya Lal said India’s priorities at the SCO include trade, connectivity, and respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity. Modi is expected to hold bilateral meetings on the sidelines, with possible announcements on troop withdrawals, trade facilitation, visa easing, climate cooperation, and people-to-people engagement.While substantive policy breakthroughs are unlikely, analysts believe the optics of the summit will be crucial. ""This summit is about optics, really powerful optics,"" Olander said. PM Modi will leave China after the summit, while Putin is expected to stay for a World War Two military parade in Beijing, marking an unusually long foreign visit for the Russian leader.(With inputs from Reuters)","Chinese President Xi Jinping will host more than 20 world leaders at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin next week. The summit will be attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and leaders from Central Asia, the Middle East, South Asia, and Southeast Asia.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123537494,imgsize-24274,width-400,resizemode-4/123537494.jpg"

MYSURU: A 25-year-old man was detained in connection with the mysterious murder of a woman in a lodge room in Saligrama taluk, Mysuru district, Saturday.According to police, the 20-year-old woman, married and has a two-year-old child, was found with her mouth and right part of her face ripped open in what seemed to be a controlled blast triggered by an unidentified device. When police arrived, Darshitha was found dead in a pool of blood on the floor of the hotel room in Bherya village, 55km from Mysuru city.Police claimed the suspect, Siddaraju, from Bettadapura in Periyapatna, had brought Darshitha from Hunsur's Gerasanahalli to visit a temple. He allegedly plotted the murder of Darshitha as she refused to marry him, according to police. They reportedly knew each other for 7 years. Siddaraju worked at a hardware shop, while she lived with her parents at Gerasanahalli. Her husband lives in Kerala.Police suspect the accused may have used a pressure-triggering object or electricity to kill her. It's suspected Siddaraju may have electrocuted her by forcibly inserting a cable into her mouth and turning the power switch on, as a two-metre electric cable was recovered from the spot.Siddaraju allegedly attempted to carry Darshitha's body on his shoulder.The hotel staff asked him not to move the body until police arrived, police stated.Mysuru superintendent of police N Vishnuvardhana said police are being assisted by a forensic science expert to identify the object used to kill the woman. He ruled out the use of gelatine sticks or any combustible materials to injure and kill the woman. An investigation is being carried out to identify the object used to cause her severe bleeding in her mouth, which resulted in her death.According to lodge manager Manu, the duo arrived seeking a room around 2pm Saturday. Siddaraju introduced Darshitha as his wife. He went out to get food, returned with a parcel in a plastic cover about 30 minutes later and claimed the room was locked from inside.Immediately, lodge staff force-opened the door. To their shock, they found Darshitha dead in a pool of blood.Manu appeared to suggest it was a mysterious blast since there was no sound of an explosion and there were no traces of gunpowder inside the room.","A 25-year-old man was detained in connection with the mysterious murder of a woman in a lodge room in Mysuru district.

One of them was sentenced to death and the other life imprisonment.The apex court pulled up police for a shabby investigation. A bench of justices Vikram Nath, Sanjay Karol and Sandeep Mehta quashed the 2018 Allahabad HC order, by which the conviction and sentence awarded by a trial court in 2014 was upheld, and directed that the two be released forthwith. It said the HC had made a grave error in placing reliance on the evidence, including DNA profiling, which had glaring discrepancies.The only evidence against the two was that clothes and other items belonging to the girl were found in the agricultural field of the main accused and a comb found near the body allegedly belonged to the second accused. SC noted that these were not sent for forensic examination.""...The scientific analysis of these articles might have provided vital evidence for proving the guilt of the accused-appellants or otherwise.The very fact that the investigating officer (Narad Muni Singh) did not consider it essential to send the articles to FSL gives rise to a strong suspicion that the recovery of these articles was a planted recovery,"" SC said. The court also noted that recovery of the victim's underwear was not initially mentioned in the report. It said the omission was far too significant to be overlooked.

New Delhi: Ahead of PM Narendra Modi's visit to Tianjin in China for the SCO summit, govt on Tuesday said India was seeking a strong condemnation of cross-border terrorism in the Tianjin declaration, the joint statement that will follow the summit.Senior officials recalled that when SCO was established, one of its main objectives was to counter challenges to peace and security arising from terrorism, separatism and extremism.MEA secretary (west) Tanmaya Lal, in a joint briefing with foreign secretary Vikram Misri, said while the declaration text was still being finalised, India was working with other member-states to ensure there was a reiteration of the strong condemnation of terrorism.This will be the first meeting of the SCO leaders after the Pahalgam attack and India expects the declaration to reflect the solidarity expressed by the international community.

New Delhi: Maharashtra, through senior lawyer Harish Salve, told Supreme Court on Tuesday that the Constitution empowers a governor or the President, not an assembly, to have the final say on a state bill. It made a five-judge bench led by CJI B R Gavai ask: ""Is this the federal governance structure envisaged by Constitution framers?""Making good his argument, Salve, who has moved to the UK and is now the King's Counsel, told the bench of CJI Gavai and Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar that the Constitution mandates that the President will always be bound by the aid and advice of the Union council of ministers led by the PM but there is no such provision of aid and advice by state council of ministers for a governor on a bill passed by an assembly.He said when a governor reserves a bill for the consideration of the President, the latter will either grant or withhold assent based on the advice of the PM-led council of ministers. If a governor or the President withholds assent, the bill falls through, Salve said, adding that the framers of the Constitution intended a federal governance where Parliament/President will have the last word on framing of laws, not the assemblies.","Senior lawyer Harish Salve told Supreme Court that the Constitution empowers a governor or the President, not an assembly, to have the final say on a state bill.

As additional tariffs imposed on India made landfall on Wednesday, US President Donald Trump once again asserted that he prevented a nuclear war between New Delhi and Islamabad by threatening crippling tariffs and halting trade deals unless the two countries agreed to a ceasefire.Speaking during a cabinet meeting at the White House on Wednesday, Trump said he threatened India with steep tariffs and refused to proceed with a trade deal unless the conflict was resolved.“I am talking to a very terrific man, Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi. I said what's going on with you and Pakistan... The hatred was tremendous. This has been going on for a hell of a long time, like, sometimes with different names for hundreds of years,” Trump said.Trump went on to say that he issued a warning during a call with PM Modi, “I said, I don't want to make a trade deal with you... You guys are going to end up in a nuclear war... I said, call me back tomorrow, but we're not going to do any deals with you, or we're going to put tariffs on you that are so high, your head's going to spin.”Trump claimed that within five hours of the conversation, both sides had backed down. “It was done. Now maybe it starts again.I don't know. I don't think so, but I'll stop it if it does. We can't let these things happen,” he said.The US President also reiterated his claim that the conflict had resulted in the downing of several military aircraft. “That's not good, that's a lot of jets. 150 million dollar planes were shot down, a lot of them - seven, maybe it could be higher, they never revealed the true numbers,” he said, without providing evidence or citing official sources.Drawing a parallel with the Russia-Ukraine war, Trump said the India-Pakistan situation had the potential to escalate into a global crisis. “Just like Russia and Ukraine were going to pull the world into World War, India and Pakistan were going to end in nuclear war,” he said.Trump has made similar claims in the past, saying his intervention prevented an all-out war between the two South Asian rivals. However, India has repeatedly denied any third-party involvement in the de-escalation.Defence minister Rajnath Singh had earlier said that the ceasefire was a result of India's own strategic decisions and that no external pressure was a factor.PM Modi himself last month in Parliament categorically refuted the claims of any third party mediation, so have other senior ministers including external affairs minister S Jaishankar and home minister Amit Shah.",US President Donald Trump claims he prevented a nuclear war between India and Pakistan.

Trump’s broader death penalty agenda

Crime, troops, and political tensions

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday said that his administration will seek the death penalty in all murder cases in Washington, DC, a move that could collide with longstanding city law and resistance from juries.“Anybody murders something in the capital, capital punishment. Capital, capital punishment,” Trump declared during a Cabinet meeting. “It'll be a crime free city. By the way, speaking of that, anybody murders something in the capital. Capital punishment. If somebody kills somebody in the capital, Washington DC, we're going to be seeking the death penalty.”The president framed capital punishment as a “very strong preventative” measure but did not provide specifics. He noted that while states must decide for themselves, prosecutors in the nation’s capital would pursue executions in eligible cases.“And that's a very strong preventative. And everybody that's heard it agrees with it. I don't know if we're ready for it in this country, but we have it. We have no choice...”Washington DC has not had a death penalty for more than four decades, BBC reported. The Supreme Court nullified the city’s statute in 1972, and the council repealed it in 1981.A 2002 referendum pushed by Congress also saw residents overwhelmingly reject reinstatement.Most murders in the city are tried in DC Superior Court, where capital punishment is not an option. However, the US attorney’s office in Washington, unlike in any other jurisdiction, handles both local and federal cases and could seek the death penalty under federal law.“We will use all legal sanctions and sentences called for by law,” US Attorney Jeanine Pirro said when pressed on whether her office would pursue executions, BBC reported.The announcement builds on Trump’s January executive order reinstating the federal death penalty, overturning the Biden administration’s moratorium. During his first term, Trump oversaw 13 federal executions in just six months, the highest in modern history, including one just five days before leaving office.His order described executions as “an essential tool for deterring and punishing those who would commit the most heinous crimes.”Trump’s remarks came as about 800 National Guard troops and hundreds of federal officers remain stationed in Washington, DC, part of a broader federal crackdown he says could extend to Chicago and Baltimore. He has denounced the capital as gripped by “complete and total lawlessness.”DC Mayor Muriel Bowser pushed back, noting that violent crime has dropped after a 2023 spike. “We are at a 30-year violent crime low,” she said, dismissing Trump’s rhetoric as exaggerated.Illinois Governor JB Pritzker also condemned Trump’s comments about Chicago, accusing him of “attempting to manufacture a crisis.”","US President Donald Trump said his administration will seek the death penalty in all murder cases in Washington, DC.

Trump administration has warned that California, Washington, and New Mexico may face significant cuts in federal safety funding unless they enforce English language requirements for commercial truck drivers - a move spurred by a recent fatal crash in Florida involving an Indian-origin driver, reported Fox news.Transportation secretary Sean Duffy told reporters the three states have 30 days to comply with English language proficiency (ELP) mandates, or risk losing millions under the motor carrier safety assistance program.“States don’t get to pick and choose which federal safety rules to follow,” he said. “As we saw with the horrific Florida crash that killed three, when states fail to enforce the law, they put the driving public in danger,” the news outlet quoted.The threatened cuts are substantial, $33 million for California, $10.5 million for Washington, and $7 million for New Mexico.The new enforcement follows a deadly crash on August 12, when an Indian origin trucker Harjinder Singh - living in the US illegally - made a U-turn on Florida’s Turnpike. The resulting accident killed all three occupants of a minivan. Singh has since been charged with vehicular homicide and immigration violations.Duffy accused the states of lax enforcement after internal reviews revealed widely varying practices. In California, more than 34,000 inspections led to only one driver taken off the road for failing the language test. In Washington, out of more than 6,000 inspections, only four drivers were removed. New Mexico reportedly enforced no such removals.“This is about keeping people safe on the road… we need to make sure that those… driving big rigs… can understand the road signs, that they’ve been well-trained,” Duffy emphasised. The political fallout has begun. California governor Gavin Newsom’s office responded sharply: “This is rich. The Trump Administration approved the federal work permit for the man who killed 3 people - and now they’re scrambling to shift blame after getting caught,” calling the announcement “a big joke.”","California, Washington, and New Mexico may face significant cuts in federal safety funding unless they enforce English language requirements for commercial truck drivers.

US President Donald Trump opened a marathon Cabinet meeting at the White House with an awkward riff about attorney general Pam Bondi’s looks, before launching into a three-hour-and-16-minute stream of consciousness that lurched from tariffs to artificial intelligence.“I look at Pam. I would never say she’s beautiful, because that’s gonna be the end of my political career,” Trump said, sparking uneasy laughter from around the table.What followed was part monologue, part stand-up routine, as the 79-year-old president shifted from drug prices — confusing Eli Lilly with Johnson & Johnson — to his plan for a “very substantial” tariff on furniture.He claimed to have slashed prescription costs by “1,500 per cent,” praised wife Melania’s new AI initiative as “the new internet, the new television, the new everything all put together in one,” and said his second term didn’t truly begin until he redecorated the Oval Office.Trump also lobbed insults at rivals, calling Illinois Governor JB Pritzker a “slob” and mocking senate majority leader Chuck Schumer’s age, while lauding secretary of state Marco Rubio as “born for this job.”Rubio, floated as a future presidential contender, looked visibly uneasy at Trump’s suggestion he should never run for another office again.At other moments, Trump mused about being labeled a dictator — “if that’s the case, I’d rather have a dictator” — waved around a Meta data center mockup, griped about windmills, and dismissed Russia’s peace talk posture as “bulls--t.”Cabinet members largely played along. Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer boasted she had hung a giant banner of Trump’s face on her department’s headquarters. “You are really the transformational president of the American worker,” she gushed.By the time it wrapped, Trump had veered across dozens of subjects — from egg prices to “dirty doors” at restaurants — with one constant: a captive audience willing to applaud, laugh, and flatter their leader.",US President Donald Trump opened a marathon Cabinet meeting at the White House with an awkward riff about attorney general Pam Bondi’s looks.

US restaurant chain Cracker Barrel announced Tuesday it will restore its original logo after a week-long backlash from customers and political leaders, including President Donald Trump, who criticised its recent rebrand.The Lebanon, Tennessee-based chain confirmed in a statement on its website that it would keep its traditional emblem featuring an elderly man in overalls, known as “Uncle Herschel,” sitting next to a barrel alongside the words “Old Country Store.” “We thank our guests for sharing your voices and love for Cracker Barrel. Our new logo is going away and our ‘Old Timer’ will remain,” the company said.The controversy began last week when Cracker Barrel introduced a simplified text-only design as part of an effort to modernise its 660 restaurants across 43 states and appeal to younger customers.However, the shift sparked a culture war backlash online, with critics branding the move “woke.”The company’s shares, which had slumped after the rebrand, rebounded following the announcementOn Monday, Cracker Barrel issued an apologetic statement saying it “could have done a better job sharing who we are and who we’ll always be.” By Tuesday morning, Trump weighed in on Truth Social, urging the chain to revert to its old design, describing customer feedback as “the ultimate Poll.”Hours later, the company confirmed the reversal.Trump celebrated the decision, writing: “Congratulations ‘Cracker Barrel’ on changing your logo back to what it was. All of your fans very much appreciate it. Good luck into the future. Make lots of money and, most importantly, make your customers happy again!”As per ABC News, Cracker Barrel stressed it would continue honouring its long-standing traditions, including the porch rocking chairs and menu favourites tied to Uncle Herschel’s legacy. “At Cracker Barrel, it’s always been – and always will be – about serving up delicious food, warm welcomes, and the kind of country hospitality that feels like family,” the company said.The White House also joined the mockery by sharing a spoofed logo on X with a caption “Go woke, go broke”. The image shared featured Trump in place of Uncle Herschel with the words “America First” and the slogan “AMERICA IS BACK.”Despite CEO Julie Masino’s earlier defence of modernisation, Cracker Barrel’s climbdown reflects the strength of its loyal customer base.

In May 2025, she stormed the stage at a Muslim civic engagement event at the Texas State Capitol, snatching the microphone and launching into an anti-Islam tirade.Footage shared online showed her declaring,The event, known as Texas Muslim Capitol Day, included prayers, training sessions and meetings with lawmakers.Her actions drew sharp criticism from civil rights groups, including the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), which denounced her rhetoric as dangerous and called for accountability while stressing the importance of protecting religious liberty.The Quran-burning episode adds to a string of provocative stunts.In December 2024, Gomez released a campaign video depicting the mock execution of a hooded immigrant, calling for “public executions” of undocumented migrants accused of violent crimes.Social media platforms restricted the footage for violating rules on violent content. Earlier this year, she filmed herself burning LGBTQ+ literature, vowing to ban such material if elected, while also targeting transgender communities in her remarks.Born in Medellín, Colombia, on May 8, 1999, Gomez moved to the US with her family in 2009, settling in Jersey City, New Jersey.

In 2024, she ran unsuccessfully for Missouri Secretary of State, finishing sixth in the Republican primary with just 7.4% of the vote.Despite repeated electoral failures and multiple social media bans for violating platform rules, Gomez has continued to build her profile online with incendiary content, positioning herself as a far-right figure unafraid of controversy.","Republican congressional candidate Valentina Gomez has triggered fresh outrage online.

The incident

A 56-year-old Australian man has been identified as the suspect in a deadly shooting that left two police officers dead and a third seriously wounded, as a large-scale manhunt entered its second day on Wednesday in Victoria’s remote northeast.Victoria Police chief commissioner Mike Bush said the suspect, Dezi Freeman, was “heavily armed” and skilled in wilderness survival. Authorities have urged residents in the area to remain indoors.“Be vigilant, keep yourselves safe. Please don’t go outside if you don’t need to,” Bush told locals.Australian media reported that Freeman espouses so-called ‘sovereign citizen’ beliefs. A 2021 video showed him attempting to “arrest” a magistrate and police officers while representing himself in court.Sovereign citizen movements reject government authority using debunked legal arguments. In a 2024 Supreme Court case, where Freeman unsuccessfully challenged the suspension of his driver’s license, a judge noted his “history of unpleasant encounters with police,” whom he referred to asNazisandterrorist thugsBush cautioned, however, that it was “too soon to say” if Freeman's ideology motivated the attack.He added that the targeted officers were part of a specialist unit investigating sexual offenses and child abuse.The shooting unfolded on Tuesday, when 10 armed officers attempted to execute a search warrant at Freeman’s property in Porepunkah, a town of just over 1,000 people, near Melbourne.Freeman allegedly opened fire, killing a 59-year-old detective and a 35-year-old senior constable. A second detective was shot and his injuries are non-life threatening.","A 56-year-old Australian man has been identified as the suspect in a deadly shooting that left two police officers dead and a third seriously wounded.

‘Disappointed but not surprised’: Fema employees put on leave after dissent; agency accused of retaliation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/disappointed-but-not-surprised-fema-employees-put-on-leave-after-dissent-agency-accused-of-retaliation/articleshow/123537489.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: AP)

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) has suspended around 30 employees after they signed an open letter to Congress warning that the Trump administration’s overhaul of the disaster-relief agency had gutted its ability to respond to hurricanes, floods and other extreme weather events.According to The New York Times, the suspended workers were among 182 current and former Fema staffers who signed the so-called “Katrina Declaration,” released Monday ahead of the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina.Thirty-six employees signed with their names, while the rest remained anonymous for fear of retaliation. Those who publicly identified themselves received emails Tuesday evening placing them on paid administrative leave “effective immediately, and continuing until further notice.”The letter accused the administration of seeking to dismantle Fema and warned of “cascading effects” that could lead to “another national catastrophe like Hurricane Katrina, [or] the effective dissolution of Fema itself and the abandonment of the American people.”As per CNN, the declaration also accused US President Donald Trump and homeland security secretary Kristi Noem of undermining Fema’s capabilities, appointing unqualified leadership, and stripping the agency of congressionally mandated authority.Signatories urged Congress to shield Fema from political interference and protect its workforce.Virginia Case, a supervisory analyst at Fema who signed the letter, was quoted as saying by CNN that she received notice of suspension and knew of at least six colleagues in the same position. “I’m disappointed but not surprised,” she said. “The public deserves to know what’s happening, because lives and communities will suffer if this continues”, she added.Colette Delawalla, executive director of Stand Up for Science, which publicised the letter, was quoted as saying by The New York Times that the move “appeared to be an act of retaliation.”She added, “Once again, we are seeing the federal government retaliate against our civil servants for whistleblowing — which is both illegal and a deep betrayal of the most dedicated among us.”Fema, in response, defended the administration’s reforms. A spokesperson cited by CNN said, “It is not surprising that some of the same bureaucrats who presided over decades of inefficiency are now objecting to reform. Change is always hard … Our obligation is to survivors, not to protecting broken systems.”As per news agency AP, at least two employees were ordered to check in daily despite being placed on indefinite leave with pay. Notices reviewed by AP stated the move “is not a disciplinary action and is not intended to be punitive.”The suspensions follow similar actions at other agencies. In July, the Environmental Protection Agency placed 144 workers on leave after they signed a dissent letter, while the department of homeland security ordered some employees to take polygraph tests amid leak investigations.The Trump administration has proposed cutting Fema’s staff and non-disaster grants, while signalling plans to “wean” states off the agency. Fema has already lost one-third of its workforce this year through firings and buyouts.Critics say such moves risk repeating the catastrophic failures seen during Hurricane Katrina in 2005.",The Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) has suspended around 30 employees.

From “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!” to warm wishes

Trump’s feud with “woke” Swift

Wedding invite? Don’t count on It

Even Donald Trump couldn’t escape a Taylor Swift question this week.At a press conference on Tuesday, before diving into a serious query about visas for Chinese students, a reporter asked the US president for his reaction to Swift’s engagement to NFL star Travis Kelce Trump’s response was unexpectedly cordial: “I wish them a lot of luck. I think he’s a great player, and he’s a great guy, and I think she’s a terrific person.”The soft tone was a sharp contrast to Trump’s past tirades against the pop icon. Back in 2024, after Swift endorsed Kamala Harris, Trump posted in all caps: “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!” and warned she would “probably pay a price” for backing his Democratic rival.Swift has long leaned blue. She endorsed Harris last election, urged fans to register to vote in 2020, and helped drive a surge in sign-ups at Vote.org with one Instagram post. Her influence has made her a political target, especially for Trump.Earlier this month, Trump even dragged Swift into the controversy over Sydney Sweeney ’s American Eagle jeans ad. While praising Sweeney as “HOTTEST,” Trump used the moment to bash Swift again: “Ever since I said I HATE her on Truth, she was booed out of the Super Bowl and became NO LONGER HOT.”Swift announced her engagement on Instagram on Tuesday with the playful caption: “Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married.” Photos showed Kelce on one knee in a lush garden, with Swift flashing her vintage engagement ring.At least for now, Trump’s reaction is all smiles. But whether he makes the guest list? Highly doubtful.","The US president was asked about Swift's engagement to NFL star Travis Kelce at a press conference on Tuesday.

Foreign aid row: Trump administration seeks Supreme Court intervention to block $12 billion spending; DOJ warns of ‘irreparable costs’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/foreign-aid-row-trump-administration-seeks-supreme-court-intervention-to-block-12-billion-spending-doj-warns-of-irreparable-costs/articleshow/123536455.cms,"Trump administration seeks Supreme Court intervention to block $12 billion foreign aid (Picture credit: AP)

The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to step into a legal battle over foreign aid funds, warning that without intervention, it will be forced to disburse billions of dollars, overriding the administration’s foreign-policy judgments.In an emergency appeal filed Tuesday, the justice department urged the justices to block a lower court order requiring the government to obligate some $12 billion in aid before the fiscal year ends on September 30, according to CNN.Solicitor general John Sauer argued that forcing immediate spending would “inflict irreparable diplomatic costs” and undermine the administration’s authority. “Any lingering dispute about the proper disposition of funds that the President seeks to rescind shortly before they expire should be left to the political branches, not effectively prejudged by the district court,” he wrote, according to Politico.The case stems from US President Donald Trump’s 90-day freeze on foreign aid announced on his inauguration day. As per news agency Reuters, the pause was followed by moves to gut USAID, including sidelining much of its staff and exploring its absorption into the State Department.Two nonprofit groups, AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition and Journalism Development Network, sued, claiming the freeze unlawfully blocked congressionally approved funds earmarked for global health and HIV/AIDS programs.While a three-judge panel of the DC Circuit Court ruled earlier this month that only Congress has standing to challenge spending impoundments under the 1974 Impoundment Control Act, the full court has yet to decide.For now, US District Judge Amir Ali’s order remains in effect, requiring the administration to spend billions by the September deadline. The Trump administration told the justices that the district court has “installed itself as supervisor-in-chief of further spending and rescissions proposals,” as CNN reported.Plaintiffs argue that the freeze jeopardises lives and undermines Congress’s constitutional role.Mitchell Warren, executive director of the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, said in a statement cited by Politico, “Time and again, this administration has shown their disdain for foreign assistance and a disregard for people’s lives … the question being put to SCOTUS is whether they will be complicit in further eroding the constitutional commitment to checks and balances.”The administration has asked the Supreme Court to issue a ruling by September 2 to avoid what it calls “extensive preliminary steps” to release the funds.The justices narrowly declined to intervene in March, allowing litigation to continue, but the issue is now back before the high court with even greater urgency.","The case stems from US President Donald Trump’s 90-day freeze on foreign aid announced on his inauguration day.

Sioux City stunner: Democrats flip Iowa Senate seat as Catelin Drey defeats Christopher Prosch; GOP supermajority shattered,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/sioux-city-stunner-democrats-flip-iowa-senate-seat-as-catelin-drey-defeats-christopher-prosch-gop-supermajority-shattered/articleshow/123537824.cms,"File photo: Catelin Drey (Picture credit: X)

Iowa Democrats scored a notable win on Tuesday after Catelin Drey, the party’s nominee, defeated Republican Christopher Prosch in a special election for a Sioux City–area state Senate seat, breaking the GOP’s two-thirds supermajority.According to preliminary results reported by county officials, Drey led by nearly 800 votes, or 11 percentage points, with all precincts counted, according to the New York Times.Michelle K Skaff, the auditor and election commissioner in Woodbury County, said only two additional ballots remained outstanding and could be added if received by Wednesday.With this outcome, Democrats will now hold 17 seats in the chamber, compared with 33 for Republicans. The shift strips Republicans of the supermajority that allowed them to confirm Governor Kim Reynolds’ nominees without Democratic support, NBC News reported.The seat was left vacant after Republican Sen. Rocky De Witt, who won the district in 2022, died of cancer in June. Reynolds had called the special election earlier this summer.Drey, who founded the left-leaning policy group Moms for Iowa, campaigned on issues such as affordable child care, gun restrictions, and abortion rights.Prosch, a business owner, had focused his campaign on cutting taxes, opposing “woke ideologies” in schools, and supporting Donald Trump’s immigration policies.National Democrats hailed the result as evidence of growing momentum. “When Democrats organise everywhere, we win everywhere, and today is no exception,” Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin said in a statement, as cited by The New York Times.He argued that voters saw Republicans as a “rubber stamp” for Trump’s agenda and were ready for change.Heather Williams, president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, called the win a “flashing warning” to the GOP, saying voters were rejecting “the failing MAGA agenda.”The win is Democrats’ second flip in the Iowa Senate this year. In January, Mike Zimmer captured a seat in eastern Iowa in a district that Trump had won by more than 20 points, as per The Hill.While Iowa remains solidly Republican, the GOP controls every statewide office but one and dominates the state legislature, Democrats see these special election victories as signs of renewed energy despite the party’s broader challenges in the region.","Catelin Drey defeated Republican Christopher Prosch in a special election for a Sioux City–area state Senate seat.

Some programmes for black students become 'illegal DEI' under Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/some-programmes-for-black-students-become-illegal-dei-under-trump/articleshow/123536093.cms,"Chicago is a testing ground for some of the Left's biggest ideas about race and education. School systems in the city and nearby suburbs are pushing to hire more Black male teachers, add more Black history and train teachers in concepts like white privilege.Some of those policies have a strong record of improving student learning, while others lack much track record. But for the Trump administration, all of it could be against the law.Now, school districts with programs aimed at lifting up Black students, and others, are finding themselves legally vulnerable. The White House is pursuing a reversal of the federal govt's traditional role on race and schools, going after what it calls ""illegal DEI,"" or diversity, equity and inclusion. The administration is using the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights, which was established to protect racial and ethnic minority groups, to try to end programmes meant to help some of those same students.Through executive orders, investigations and threats to cut funding, govt has put what was once a bipartisan movement to address the legacy of slavery and racism on the defensive. Even Republican-leaning states such as Florida and Mississippi have teacher recruitment programs intended, in part, to diversify the workforce - an idea the administration has called illegal affirmative action.Trump administration lawyers are arguing that when school leaders direct resources to racial groups that remain behind, they discriminate against those that have traditionally been ahead.Nowhere is the potential impact of this reversal starker than in Illinois. The education department has announced civil rights investigations into two of the state's most prominent school systems, in Chicago and in the nearby college town of Evanston, accusing them of breaking the law by focusing school improvement efforts on nonwhite children. Conservatives hope the cases against the two districts will set precedents that can reach into schools and other institutions nationally.Kimberly Hermann, president of Southeastern Legal Foundation, the conservative group that filed a lawsuit and federal complaint against the school district in Evanston, acknowledged that many education leaders believe race-conscious programs will help disadvantaged students. ""Sometimes you can have a noble goal,"" she said, ""but you can't implement it in a way that violates laws.""This fall, Chicago Public Schools will roll out what it calls the Black Student Success Plan. It calls for doubling the number of Black male teachers hired by 2029, reducing disciplinary actions against Black students, adding more Black history and enrolling more Black children in advanced courses.Sarah Parshall Perry, vice president of Defending Education, a conservative legal group that filed a federal complaint against the plan, argued that by focusing so much on Black students, Chicago risked ignoring the needs of other groups, like Hispanic students. Black children make up 34% of the district's students, while Hispanic children account for nearly half. ""I think a lot of these schools are well intentioned but ill advised,"" Perry said. ""In their effort to level the playing field for one specific group, they have failed to account for the needs of all students."" Chicago Public Schools did not respond to questions.",The White House is pursuing a reversal of the federal govt's traditional role on race and schools.

A deadly Israeli strike on a Gaza hospital that killed 20 people, including five journalists, was targeting what the military believed was a Hamas surveillance camera, as well as people identified as militants, the Israeli military said in a statement on Tuesday.The military issued the statement as part of its initial inquiry into the attack, which Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu called a ""tragic mishap.""The military said the back-to-back strikes on southern Gaza's largest hospital were ordered because soldiers believed militants were using the camera to observe Israeli forces and because Israel has long believed Hamas and other militant groups are present at hospitals, though Israeli officials rarely give evidence.The military's chief of general staff acknowledged several ""gaps"" in the investigation so far, including the kind of ammunition used to take out the camera.The initial findings emerged Tuesday as a surge of outrage and unanswered questions mounted, after international leaders and rights groups condemned the strikes.

Financial markets worldwide have been rattled by President Donald Trump 's announcement that he's firing Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook, an unprecedented move and sharp escalation in his effort to exert greater control over what has long been considered an institution independent from politics.But Cook said she's not leaving, and her lawyer said Tuesday that she'll sue to keep her job. ""President Trump purported to fire me 'for cause' when no cause exists under the law, and he has no authority to do so,"" Cook said in an emailed statement. ""I will not resign.""Trump said in a letter posted on his Truth Social platform that he is removing Cook effective immediately because of allegations by one of his supporters that she committed mortgage fraud. Market reaction was swiftly negative - economists have long preferred independent central banks because they can more easily take unpopular steps to fight inflation and ensure the economic stability that is key to business confidence.Cook's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said Trump ""has no authority to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook.""Cook, appointed by President Biden in 2022, is the first African-American woman to serve on the Federal Reserve's governing body.Trump, in a letter announcing his move to fire her on Monday, said he had ""sufficient cause to remove you from your position"" because in 2021 Cook had indicated on documents for separate mortgage loans on properties in Michigan and Georgia that both were a primary residence where she intended to live. Cook has denied wrongdoing and has not been charged.",Lisa Cook is the first African-American woman to serve on the Federal Reserve's governing body.

The TOI correspondent from Washington:

In growing signs that the White House is ready to jettison Washington's bipartisan Indo-Pacific policy of supporting India rise as a counterweight to China, MAGA supremo Donald Trump said on Monday that the US will allow Chinese students to come in big numbers to America.Trump said the US is ""going to get along with China"" and asserted that it is going to allow their students to come in, appearing to reverse his administration's position that suspended visas for Chinese graduate students and researchers with ties to its military. The policy led to the revocation of visas for approximately 1,000 Chinese scholars.""We're going to allow their students to come in. It's very important, 600,000 students. But we're going to get along with China,"" Trump told reporters from the Oval Office during a meeting with South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung, even as he warned Beijing of a 200% tariff if it withheld rare earth magnets export to the US. It is not clear where Trump dredged the 600,000 number from since there are currently around 270,000 Chinese students in US. India has more than 300,000 students in the US.Broadly, foreign students from the global south are having to jump through hoops to study in the US now as Trump's MAGA hardliners have launched a campaign against them, saying US universities and corporations use them to undercut wages and deny jobs to native-born Americans.Trump's sudden outreach to Chinese students, who have increasingly been preferring to study at home, triggered an immediate backlash from MAGA hardliners, including those who have been abusing each other.""Nobody, I repeat nobody, wants 600,000 more Chinese 'students' aka Communist spies in the US. China murdered 1.2 million Americans. Now they get to replace us? This cannot happen,"" said MAGA megaphone Laura Loomer, tagging Trump's immigration policy czar Stephen Miller to her post on X. ""We should not let in 600,000 CHINESE students to attend American colleges and universities that may be loyal to the CCP,"" chimed in Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor-Greene.But Trump's pivot seemed to extend beyond the student visa issue as he alternately courted and threatened Beijing to keep an emerging Eurasian grouping in the form of the SCO off balance. During his meeting with South Korean President Lee, Trump said that the US holds ""incredible cards"" in its trade dispute with China, and he could ""destroy"" their economy if he chose to. But he wouldn't - and US would ""get along with China"", he said.","Trump said the US is ""going to get along with China"" and asserted that it is going to allow their students to come in.
