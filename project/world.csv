"All 7 NCP MLAs in Nagaland merge with NDPP, give CM Rio absolute majority in assembly",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/all-7-ncp-mlas-in-nagaland-merge-with-ndpp-give-cm-rio-absolute-majority-in-assembly/articleshow/121545081.cms,".

All seven Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) MLAs in Nagaland joined the ruling Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party (NDPP), giving the Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio-led party an absolute majority in the 60-member assembly.With this merger, the NDPP's tally increased from 25 to 32. NCP emerged as the third-largest party in the 2023 assembly elections, after the NDPP and its ally BJP, which won 12 seats.Addressing a press conference on Saturday, Nagaland Government Spokesperson KG Kenye said that the NCP, the third-largest group in the state assembly with 7 members, has formally merged with the NDPP.""We have been joined by a few more friends in the NDPP party force this evening; there are 9 groups in the state assembly this time and out of that, the NCP party is the third largest group in the state assembly with 7 members,"" said Kenye, who is also a minister in the state.The Speaker of the House has accepted the merger application. As a result, the NDPP's strength in the state assembly has increased from 25 to 32 members.Kenye emphasised that this development will strengthen Chief Minister Dr Rio's leadership and enhance the government's ability to serve the people.He clarified that coalition seat-sharing arrangements are not permanent and may be reconsidered in future elections.On the ministerial reshuffling, he stated that it falls under the Chief Minister's prerogative.Addressing the reason behind the merger move, he explained that national parties like the NCP face constraints in addressing state-specific issues. The move was motivated by the desire for a more state-focused political approach.He pointed out that the merger was influenced by both political necessity and the leadership appeal of the current government and NDPP leaders.Apart from 32 NDPP and 12 BJP MLAs, the state assembly has five NPP legislators, two members each of the LJP (Ram Vilas), Naga People's Front and RPI (Athawale, a JD (U) MLA and four independents.","All seven Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) MLAs in Nagaland joined the ruling Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party (NDPP) NCP emerged as the third-largest party in the 2023 assembly elections, after the NDPP and its ally BJP, which won 12 seats.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121545129,imgsize-28278,width-400,resizemode-4/121545129.jpg"

You and any order given by you are greater than God. If you are there then I have everything. I just need your trust and love and nothing else,” Tej Pratap posted on X, formerly Twitter. “Papa, if you were not there then this party would not have been there and neither would greedy people like Jaichand who do politics with me. Just mummy papa, may you both always be healthy and happy. ”The post came days after the RJD patriarch expelled his eldest son from the party for six years, accusing him of disregarding moral values and harming the family’s principles. The decision followed a controversial Facebook post by Tej Pratap in which he revealed a 12-year-long relationship with a woman named Anushka, a post he later said was the result of his account being “hacked.”“Ignoring moral values in personal life weakens our collective struggle for social justice,” Lalu had written in his own X post on May 26.“The actions, public conduct, and irresponsible behavior of my eldest son are not in accordance with our family’s principles. Therefore, under these circumstances, I am removing him from the party and the family.”Lalu added that while his son is “capable of judging what is right or wrong in his personal life,” those choosing to associate with him should do so at their own discretion.Reacting to the development, Tejashwi Yadav, Tej Pratap’s younger brother and RJD’s key face in Bihar, stated that the party maintains a clear boundary between personal and political conduct. “We cannot tolerate such things. If it's about my big brother, political life and personal life are different. He has the right to make his personal decisions,” he told the media.The family dispute reignited public attention on Tej Pratap’s past, including his failed marriage with Aishwarya Rai, granddaughter of former Bihar chief minister Daroga Rai. Aishwarya had parted ways within months of their wedding, citing mistreatment by Tej Pratap and his family.","Tej Pratap Yadav shared an emotional message on social media, addressing his parents Lalu and Rabri Devi.

Poll hould there be a comprehensive review of India's defense preparedness? Yes No

NEW DELHI: Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge on Saturday targeted the Modi government following the remarks made by Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Anil Chauhan on Operation Sindoor in an interview in Singapore. Kharge claimed that the nation had been misled and demanded a special session of Parliament to address the issue.“In the wake of the remarks made by the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) in Singapore in an interview, there are some very important questions which need to be asked. These can only be asked if a Special Session of the Parliament is immediately convened. The Modi Govt has misled the nation. The fog of war is now clearing,” Kharge said in a post on X.Kharge referenced CDS Chauhan who had earlier today, firmly dismissed Pakistan's claims that it had downed six Indian warplanes during Operation Sindoor, describing the statement as ""absolutely incorrect"". Speaking toduring the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, he said, ""What is important is that, not the jet being down, but why they were being downed."" He explained that the Indian Armed Forces identified tactical errors, corrected them, and resumed operations within two days.Also read: What CDS Anil Chauhan said on Pakistan's claim of downing India jets during Operation Sindoor Kharge lauded the bravery of IAF pilots, saying: “Our IAF pilots were risking their lives fighting the enemy. We have suffered some losses, but our pilots were safe. We salute their resolute courage and bravery.” However, he stressed that a “comprehensive strategic review is the need of the hour.”“The Congress party demands a Comprehensive Review of our Defence Preparedness by an independent expert committee, on the lines of the Kargil Review Committee,” he added.Kharge also raised concerns over US President Donald Trump’s repeated claim that he brokered a ceasefire between India and Pakistan. “This is a direct affront to the Shimla Agreement,” he said, questioning why the Modi government had not provided clarity on Trump’s assertions or the affidavit filed by the US Secretary of Commerce in a United States court.“Instead of clarifying Mr. Trump's repeated assertions, and the affidavit filed by US Secretary of Commerce in the United States Court of International Trade, PM Modi is on an election blitz, taking PERSONAL CREDIT for the valour of our Armed Forces, hiding behind their bravery and dodging the contours of the agreed CEASEFIRE, which the Foreign Secretary announced on 10th, after Mr. Trump's tweet,” Kharge said. “Is India and Pakistan now again hyphenated? What are the conditions of the CEASEFIRE agreement? Rs 140 Cr Patriotic Indians deserve to know this. ”Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh echoed Kharge’s concerns, criticising the lack of transparency from the government. “It is an extraordinary and telling commentary on Undeclared Emergency that the PM will not chair all-party meetings and will not take Parliament into confidence but the nation gets to know of the first phase of Operation Sindoor through the CDS’s interview in Singapore,” Ramesh posted on X. “Couldn't opposition leaders have been taken into confidence by the PM earlier?”General Chauhan, while speaking at the Shangri-La Dialogue, rejected the idea that India and Pakistan had approached nuclear confrontation, calling such claims “far-fetched.” He also dismissed Pakistan’s claims about the success of Chinese-supplied weapons, saying they “didn’t work,” and asserted that India had conducted precision strikes 300 kilometres deep into Pakistani territory.",Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge targeted the Modi government following the remarks made by Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Anil Chauhan on Operation Sindoor.

Poll Do you support the nullification of Article 370? Yes No

NEW DELHI: The all-party delegations visiting various countries to expose Pakistan post the Pahalgam attack seem to be becoming a headache for the Congress with senior party leader and former external affairs minister Salman Khurshid's recent remarks backing nullification of Article 370 in 2019 by the Modi government likely to discomfit the Congress. This comes after another delegation member, Shashi Tharoor, faced strong criticism from within the party for his statement that India crossed the line of control (LoC) to conduct surgical strikes ""for the first time"" under the Modi government.While addressing think tanks and academia in Indonesia on Friday, Khurshid said it was unfortunate that Pakistan wants to undo the prosperity that has come to Jammu & Kashmir following the abrogation. Khurshid is part of one of the seven- all party delegations currently touring various countries. The Congress had initially opposed the move to scrap Article 370. The party later nuanced its position and has since been ambivalent on the issue of restoration of the Article which granted J&K special status.""Kashmir had a major problem for a long time. Much of that was reflected in the thinking of the government in an article called 370 of the Constitution, which somehow gave the impression that it was separate from the rest of the country.But Article 370 was abrogated, it was finally put to an end, because so much time had passed.,"" Khurshid said while addressing the Indonesian think tanks and academia.""Subsequently, there was an election with 65% participation. There's an elected government in Kashmir today, and therefore, for people to want to undo everything that has happened, the prosperity that has come to Kashmir, it is very unfortunate. It will give a setback to anybody,"" Khurshid further said.While the senior leadership made no comment on Khurshid's remarks, unease within the party has been brewing ever since the government announced the names for the 51 members of the all-party delegations. The Congress had accused the Modi government of ""complete insincerity"" and for playing ""cheap political games"" while highlighting that ""regrettably"" only one of the four names suggested by the Congress leadership has been included. However, the opposition party relented, allowing ""eminent"" party members selected by the government to go with the delegations and make their contribution.The Congress had submitted the names of Anand Sharma, Gaurav Gogoi, Syed Naseer Hussain, and Amrinder Singh Raja Warring. However, the delegation finalised by the government includes Shashi Tharoor who is leading a delegation.

NEW DELHI: At least 18 people have died and dozens have been displaced across five Northeastern states as relentless rainfall triggered widespread landslides and flash floods over the past 48 hours. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued fresh warnings of heavy to extremely heavy rainfall in the region till May 31.In Mizoram, four people were killed in separate incidents triggered by landslides caused by heavy rainfall over the past two days. Among the dead were three members of a family in Champhai district and one person in Serchhip. One person remains trapped under the debris.Landslides and floods have been reported from at least 10 districts including Aizawl, Lunglei, Kolasib, Mamit, Champhai, and Serchhip. According to the Mizoram State Disaster Management and Rehabilitation Department, over 15 houses were destroyed and many roads have become inaccessible.Mizoram disaster management minister prof. Lalnilawma visited the State Emergency Operations Centre to assess the situation and announced Rs 4 lakh ex-gratia for the families of the deceased.“I assure the people that the government is doing everything it can. Relief operations are ongoing despite the difficult terrain,” he said.Governor Lt Gen VK Singh (retd) expressed condolences and urged residents in disaster-prone areas to remain alert and cooperative.In Arunachal Pradesh, nine people were killed in two separate incidents caused by heavy rains.A major tragedy occurred in East Kameng district on Friday night when a landslide on National Highway 13 pushed a vehicle carrying seven people into a deep gorge. All passengers — including a pregnant woman, three children, and three others — were from Kitchang village and were returning from Seppa town.“Due to darkness and another slide nearby, we had to halt operations. All seven bodies were recovered this morning,” said East Kameng Superintendent of Police Kamdam Sikom on Saturday.In a separate incident, two labourers were buried alive in a cabbage field in Lower Subansiri district on Saturday after a landslide hit the area where they were working.Meanwhile, in Upper Subansiri district’s Daporijo town, flash floods triggered by the overflowing Sigin river damaged over 117 houses. Authorities have issued prohibitory orders in several vulnerable areas to prevent further casualties.In Manipur, heavy rainfall has led to city-wide flooding in Imphal, affecting hundreds of homes and disrupting road traffic. Chief Secretary Prashant Kumar Singh said that emergency services and municipal departments were on high alert.The Indian Army deployed eight rescue columns to assist the civil administration. Among those rescued were members of a private radio broadcast team stranded in a low-lying area of Imphal.“The water level is dangerously high in several areas.

The state’s Emergency Operations Centre said landslides were reported from Mangan, Gyalshing, and Soreng districts.Although no casualties have been reported so far, district officials have asked people in low-lying and landslide-prone areas to remain cautious and prepare for possible evacuations.According to the IMD, the ongoing heavy rainfall in the Northeast is due to a combination of a depression over Bangladesh and a western disturbance approaching northwest India. The IMD warned of “extremely heavy rainfall at isolated places” accompanied by thunderstorms and lightning.Disaster management authorities in all affected states have ramped up relief efforts, cleared road blockades, and opened relief camps. People are being urged to avoid venturing near rivers, landslide-prone hillsides, and waterlogged streets.“The situation remains critical.

""If he is not permitted to attend the examination and internship programme, it will cause undue hardship to the petitioner,"" the court said in its interim order on Thursday.RGNIYD's assistant registrar, Avinav Thakur, the warden, and the assistant warden visited the hostel premises and found Aslam defacing the property with graffiti. An inquiry committee, including Avinav, subsequently suspended Aslam from the institute and expelled him from the hostel.However, Aslam alleged that he was being victimised after he and some other students exposed a pending sexual assault case against Avinav in Jharkhand. He claimed that Avinav influenced the committee and coerced some students to testify against him. The court then adjourned the matter for hearing on June 25.","Madras HC stays Rajiv Gandhi National Institute of Youth Development's decision to suspend PG student for defacing hostel property.

Or is Tharoor being punished simply for daring to challenge the Gandhi camp’s chosen candidate for Congress President?"" he asked.Former external affairs minister Khurshid, who is in one of the 7 all-party delegations to expose Pakistan post Pahalgam terror attack, said that prosperity and normalcy have returned to Jammu and Kashmir after abrogation of Article 370.""Kashmir had a major problem for a long time. Much of that was reflected in the thinking of the government in an article called Article 370 of the Constitution, which somehow gave the impression that it was separate from the rest of the country. But Article 370 was abrogated and it was finally put to an end,"" Khurshid said while addressing the Indonesian think tanks and academia.""Subsequently, there was an election with 65% participation in the election. There's an elected government in Kashmir today, and therefore, for people who want to undo everything that has happened, the prosperity that has come to Kashmir,"" he added.This comes after Tharoor faced criticism from party colleagues over his recent remarks on surgical strikes.Tharoor, currently leading a multi-party delegation to countries including Panama and the US, had said that India conducted its first cross-border surgical strike in 2016, a claim seen by many in the party as undermining similar operations during the UPA era.Facing flak from Congress leaders such as Pawan Khera and Udit Raj, Tharoor defended himself in a strongly worded post on X from Panama City, clarifying that his remarks specifically referred to responses to terrorist attacks, not to prior wars or conflicts.""After a long and successful day in Panama, I have to wind up at midnight here with departure for Bogota, Colombia in six hours, so I don’t really have time for this — but anyway: For those zealots fulminating about my supposed ignorance of Indian valour across the LoC: in the past,"" Tharoor said in a post on X.""I was clearly and explicitly speaking only about reprisals for terrorist attacks and not about previous wars and my remarks were preceded by a reference to the several attacks that have taken place in recent years alone, during which previous Indian responses were both restrained and constrained by our responsible respect for the LoC and the IB,"" he added.Tharoor's ""India breached the LoC for the first time during the 2016 surgical strike"" remark prompted a sharp response from his party colleague Udit Raj, who accused Tharoor of denigrating Congress's legacy. ""How could you denigrate the golden history of Congress by saying that before PM Modi, India never crossed the LoC and the International border?"" Raj questioned.He went so far as to suggest Tharoor be made a ""super spokesperson of the BJP.""Pawan Khera also weighed in, posting a screenshot from Tharoor’s book, where the MP had previously criticised the Modi government for politicising the 2016 strikes while acknowledging that the Congress had authorised several such operations in the past without publicising them.","BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya, in a post on X, pointed to Khurshid’s remarks during the ongoing multi-party MPs delegation tour.

'Backstabbed from within'

Letter bomb revealed rift

HYDERABAD: In an escalation of intra-party squabbling in Telangana, Bharat Rashtra Samithi MLC and former MP Kalvakuntla Kavitha, daughter of party supremo K Chandrasekhar Rao, Thursday accused senior netas within her own party of attempting to merge BRS with BJP - a move she says she vehemently opposed even while incarcerated in the Delhi liquor policy scam case last year.Interacting with media at her residence, Kavitha tore into the party leadership, indirectly targeting working president and her brother KT Rama Rao for failing to act against 'internal coverts,' not responding to attacks from Congress, and remaining silent during a coordinated smear campaign against her.""When I was in jail, there was talk of merging BRS with BJP. I told my father, let party remain independent, even if it meant I stayed in jail for another year,"" Kavitha said. She added her actions were aimed only at strengthening the party, and backstabbing was not in her DNA.Kavitha said there was an internal conspiracy to sideline her and sever her connection with KCR. Referring to the leak of a private letter she had written to her father earlier this month, she accused party insiders of attempting to discredit her and questioned why the leadership failed to act against those responsible.""Instead of finding those who leaked the letter, they unleashed paid social media trolls and media artistes, even from abroad, to malign me,"" she quipped.The succession war within BRS - between KTR and Kavitha - has come at a time when BRS is celebrating its silver jubilee and at the same time grappling with multiple issues, including fighting a legal battle over defections by its MLAs who have joined Congress.Analysts say succession battles typically arise after the supremo is no longer in picture. However, in BRS's case, power tussle has begun while KCR is still at the helm. Sources said KCR's relatives within BRS have already split into camps, supporting either KTR or Kavitha.The rift between the duo became apparent after Kavitha wrote a 'feedback letter' to KCR regarding his speech at the BRS silver jubilee meeting in Warangal. In the letter, she expressed dissatisfaction, particularly regarding KCR in his speech not targeting the BJP, not addressing the issue of BC reservations, lack of accessibility to BRS leaders, and other concerns. Party sources said differences emerged more than a year ago and intensified in the past few months.","Kalvakuntla Kavitha, daughter of party supremo K Chandrasekhar Rao, accused senior netas within her own party of attempting to merge BRS with BJP.

Social media buzz and public reaction





A Japanese manga artist known for her unsettlingly accurate predictions has sparked widespread concern, leading to a surge in travel cancellations to Japan., often called, has captured global attention for her chilling predictions, including a major disaster anticipated for July 2025. With a track record that reportedly includes predictions of the devastating 2011 Tohoku earthquake and the death of iconic figures, Tatsuki’s latest prediction has left travellers reconsidering their plans, citing fear, anxiety, and a desire to avoid potential danger.Tatsuki's warning has already impacted the travel industry, with agencies seeing booking declines as the predicted date nears. Airlines, hotels, and tour operators brace for further losses. Explore Tatsuki's history of accurate predictions and how concerned travelers are seeking reassurance or alternative destinations amidst growing uncertainty.Ryo Tatsuki is a Japanese manga artist whose prophetic claims have drawn comparisons to the late Bulgarian mystic Baba Vanga, known for her eerily accurate predictions about global events. Tatsuki first gained attention in 1999 with the release of her booka compilation of visions she claims to have experienced over the years.While the book initially received little mainstream attention, several of Tatsuki’s predictions have reportedly come true, earning her a devoted following in Japan and beyond.Some of her most notable forecasts include the catastrophic March 2011 earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan’s northern Tohoku region. This disaster, which claimed over 18,000 lives and triggered the Fukushima nuclear crisis, occurred in the same month and year Tatsuki had predicted with eerie accuracy. Her book also allegedly foresaw the 1995 Kobe earthquake and the death of legendary Queen frontman Freddie Mercury, further adding to her growing reputation as a modern-day seer with uncanny prophetic abilities and an expanding international following.In a revised edition of The Future I Saw, published in 2021, Tatsuki issued a stark warning about a potentially catastrophic event set to strike in July 2025. According to CNN and other media reports, Tatsuki’s prophecy describes a massive undersea rupture forming between Japan and the Philippines, capable of generating tsunamis three times the height of those seen during the 2011 Tohoku disaster. He claimed that this unprecedented natural disaster would cause widespread destruction, displace millions, and lead to a humanitarian crisis on an unimaginable scale, urging people in coastal regions to stay alert and prepare for emergency evacuation.Her prediction includes unsettling imagery of Japan’s oceans “boiling,” which some interpret as a possible reference to an underwater volcanic eruption or a massive seismic event. The epicenter of this anticipated disaster is drawn as a diamond-shaped region connecting Japan, Indonesia, Taiwan, and the Northern Mariana Islands – a part of the Pacific known for its intense geological activity.Reports indicate that Tatsuki’s prophecy has already started to influence travel behavior, particularly among tourists planning to visit Japan in the coming months. According to Hong Kong-based travel agency WWPKG, bookings to Japan dropped by as much as 50 percent during the recent Easter break, a trend expected to continue as the feared date draws closer.Speaking to CNN, CN Yuen, managing director of WWPKG, noted that concerns over Tatsuki’s prediction have been compounded by recent advisories from the Chinese embassy in Tokyo. In a statement issued in April 2025, the embassy warned Chinese nationals in Japan to remain vigilant against potential natural disasters, further fueling anxiety among travelers.The Chinese government’s warning was reportedly prompted by a series of recent seismic events and increased volcanic activity around Japan’s coastline. The South China Morning Post reported that the advisory urged residents and tourists to “take extra precautions against natural disasters,” a statement that many interpreted as an indirect acknowledgment of the growing fears surrounding Tatsuki’s prediction.Japanese authorities, however, have been more reserved in their response, focusing on reassuring the public about the country’s extensive disaster preparedness infrastructure. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) has not issued any specific alerts related to the July 2025 timeframe, emphasizing that its seismic monitoring systems remain among the most advanced in the world.Social media platforms are buzzing with speculation, as the hashtag #July2025Prediction trends globally. While some users voice concerns, others dismiss the predictions as sensationalism or coincidence. Online forums focused on earthquake preparedness have experienced a surge in engagement, with members exchanging safety tips, evacuation plans, and worst-case scenario strategies. The growing conversation highlights a mix of uncertainty and readiness as people react to the predictions surrounding this significant date. Meanwhile, influencers and content creators have begun posting reaction videos and survival guides, further fueling public interest.

Departure from the White House

Road ahead for Katie Miller







Katie Miller, a seasoned political advisor and communications strategist, has officially departed the White House alongside Elon Musk following the end of their roles as special government employees. Miller, who previously served as an advisor and spokeswoman for Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), is now set to work for him full-time. Her transition marks a significant move in Musk’s continued involvement in U.S. policy and government reform initiatives, especially after his highly publicized 130-day stint in Washington, D.C. Miller’s influence in both political and tech circles has made her a central figure in the DOGE initiative.Katie Miller is married to Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, according to insiders cited by WIRED. Katie, who served as the spokesperson for Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), will now work full-time for Musk. Meanwhile, social media has been rife with rumours speculating that Katie left her husband Stephen Miller for Elon Musk, suggesting the three were involved in a “throuple” during Musk’s time at the White House.Katie acted as the crucial link between Musk and the administration, often delivering bad news to him, while she and Stephen also helped navigate Musk through Washington. Rumors suggest Stephen Miller “used” his wife as Musk’s handler and bragged about controlling Musk, though these remain unconfirmed. A senior Republican strategist described Katie as a powerful figure who “leaves bodies everywhere she’s been.” Despite Musk’s exit signalling possible tensions with Trump, some Republicans like Vice President JD Vance believe Musk’s political influence will continue, cautioning that the “Elon era” is far from over.Katie Miller holds a BA from the University of Florida and a Master of Public Policy from George Washington University. She began her political career as a press assistant for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, later serving as press secretary for Senator Steve Daines and spokeswoman for Senator Martha McSally. In 2017, she joined the Department of Homeland Security as deputy press secretary, where she defended the Trump administration’s family separation policy. She went on to serve as press secretary and then communications director for Vice President Mike Pence, becoming a key figure in Republican communications.In December 2024, Donald Trump announced Miller’s appointment to the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), where she became a close advisor to Elon Musk. According to WIRED, she was a key intermediary between DOGE and the rest of the White House, responsible for delivering daily messaging and managing Musk’s political communication.Miller’s responsibilities grew to include coordinating Musk’s media appearances, particularly around SpaceX’s Starship launch and broader tech policy. Her influence in DOGE was described as ""pivotal"" by insiders, and she helped shape Musk’s messaging and manage sensitive government interactions.Musk’s tenure as a special government employee ended in May 2025 after 130 days, and Miller’s term concluded alongside his. Following their departure, CBS News confirmed that Miller would continue working for Musk full-time, leading communications across his ventures. Her shift to the private sector marks a new phase in their professional collaboration.Katie Miller's unique role bridging government policy and technological innovation positions her as an influential figure in both political and tech worlds. As Musk plans to step back from political spending and re-evaluate his role in public policy, Miller’s communications acumen will likely continue to play a major role in shaping the public narrative around Musk’s ventures.Her next chapter, outside of government but still within the realm of high-stakes influence, will be closely watched as Musk’s enterprises continue to blur the line between Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C.","Katie Miller has officially departed the White House alongside Elon Musk.

As Zion Williamson faces a wave of serious allegations, his girlfriend Ahkeema took to Instagram with a message focused on self-love. Just as the New Orleans Pelicans star was named in a disturbing lawsuit accusing him of r*pe, assault, and emotional abuse, Ahkeema shared a post of self-motivation. The timing of her post has drawn attention, especially given the gravity of the claims now surrounding Williamson.Ahkeema, who has nearly 56,000 followers on Instagram, posted a collage featuring two selfies and a caption that read, “Get to know me. My latest obsession, me.”The post arrived the same day Jane Doe filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court, accusing Williamson of years-long abuse. According to PEOPLE, the woman claimed the relationship began in 2018 during Williamson’s time at Duke University and escalated into acts of violence, manipulation, and r*pe.Jane Doe alleged that she was r*ped twice in 2020, once in a Beverly Hills home Williamson allegedly rented while training during the COVID pandemic.Williamson allegedly called her “stuck up” and a “b*tch” before pinning her down and r*ping her.She accuses him of using cocaine and threatening to have his security kill her and her family.Her lawyer, Rachel Lanier of The Lanier Law Firm, described the case as one of “coercive control, threats, and domination including stalking, strangulation and threats with a loaded firearm.”Lanier said her client had endured years of abuse and only after months of medical treatment and counseling, found the courage to come forward.Zion Williamson, through his attorney Michael Balascio, issued a firm denial.“The allegations contained in the complaint are categorically false and reckless,” Balascio stated. He claimed the relationship was casual and consensual, ending years ago. He asserted that “at no point during or immediately after that relationship did the plaintiff raise any concerns.”Furthermore, Balascio said Williamson reported alleged extortion attempts by the accuser and is planning to file counterclaims, “We understand that an arrest warrant was issued in connection with that report… We are confident that the legal process will expose the truth and fully vindicate Mr. Williamson.”Jane Doe’s legal team responded through attorney Sam E. Taylor, asserting, “We have every intent to take this matter to trial… Each of these claims is supported by witnesses and corroborating evidence.” According to the lawsuit filed by Doe, she is seeking damages ranging from $18 million to $50 million, as reported by the reputable media outlet, the New York Post.Also Read: New Orleans Pelicans star Zion Williamson accused of r*pe and years of abuse by former girlfriend in Los Angeles lawsuit While legal proceedings begin to unfold, Ahkeema’s message stands out as a quiet declaration of self-worth in the midst of public chaos.

Viral: MIT Grad Wears Arab Headscarf; Torches Alma Mater’s Israel Ties In Viral Speech |Megha Vemuri





At a politically charged commencement ceremony on Thursday, MIT ’s class of 2025 president Megha Vemuri, an Indian-American student, used her platform to deliver a bold pro-Palestinian message, sharply criticising the university’s ties to Israel and calling on fellow graduates to take a stand.Wearing a red keffiyeh, a symbol of Palestinian solidarity, Vemuri addressed a crowd of graduates, families, and faculty, saying, “You showed the world that MIT wants a free Palestine.”Her remarks came amid ongoing nationwide campus unrest over the war in Gaza and US university connections to defence and research institutions tied to the conflict. In her speech, Vemuri acknowledged the uncertainty gripping academia and the intense pressures faced by student activists.“It is no secret that at this time, academic institutions across the country are shrouded in a dark cloud of uncertainty,” she said. “There is a lot of fear in many of our hearts.”Vemuri pointed to MIT’s research links with the Israeli military as a source of shame and moral conflict for the institution. “The Israeli occupation forces are the only foreign military that MIT has research ties with,” she said. “This means that Israel’s assault on the Palestinian people is not only aided and abetted by our country, but our school.”She noted that both MIT’s undergraduate body and its graduate student union had, in recent months, voted “overwhelmingly to cut ties with the genocidal Israeli military.”“You faced threats, intimidation and suppression coming from all directions, especially your own university officials, but you prevailed,” she told graduates. “Because the MIT community that I know would never tolerate a genocide.”Referring to the destruction of higher education infrastructure in Gaza, Vemuri added: “There are no universities left in Gaza. We are watching Israel try to wipe Palestine off the face of the earth, and it is a shame that MIT is a part of it.”The student leader concluded her address with a symbolic gesture, asking graduates to turn their MIT class rings so that the emblem faced outward—a tradition that symbolises their move into the wider world. But her message was pointed.“We carry with us the obligation to do everything we can to stop it,” she said. “MIT is directly complicit in the ongoing genocide of the Palestinian people.”",Indian-American student Megha Vemuri delivered a bold pro-Palestinian message.

From gifted cars to internet hate – Cam Newton speaks up for NFL couple



Travis Hunter gets married, Gen Z runs the NBA & Revisiting the WORST sports takes EVER

Newton reminds public – Behind the headlines are real people







NFL veteran Cam Newton has stepped into the spotlight once again — this time not for his play, but to defend Travis Hunter and his wife, Leanna Lenee, against a growing wave of online criticism. As social media continues to scrutinize every aspect of the young couple’s relationship, Newton is calling out the double standards and harsh treatment that have disproportionately targeted Lenee.Travis Hunter, the Jacksonville Jaguars rookie and former Colorado Buffaloes standout, recently married Lenee in a high-profile ceremony. The event quickly became a lightning rod for controversy, from the flashy Brabus G-Wagon wedding gift to Lenee's tattooed ring finger. Social media erupted with accusations of her being a ""gold digger,"" questioning her intentions and loyalty. But Newton, in a recent podcast appearance, wasn’t having any of it.“He’s done everything right”, Newton said . He emphasized that Leanna Lenee has become an easy target simply because of her visibility. “She has been a punching bag, and it’s unfortunate. But guess what, baby, who’s laughing now?,"" he added.The trolling intensified after a clip from the couple’s wedding surfaced online, with critics picking apart Lenee’s facial expressions and body language. But Newton reminded listeners that viral clips lack context and often distort reality.Also read: “Is she pregnant?”: Fans flood Travis Hunter and Leanna Lenee’s wedding posts with baby rumors Cam Newton’s stance highlights a larger conversation in sports culture, the protection of young athletes and their families from toxic narratives.

Crime Branch arrests dismissed Maharashtra cop Ranjit Kasle for objectionable remarks on women’s modesty,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/crime-branch-arrests-dismissed-maharashtra-cop-ranjit-kasle-for-objectionable-remarks-on-womens-modesty/articleshow/121545348.cms,"Ranjit Kasle, a dismissed sub-inspector already embroiled in controversy over allegations of a contract to eliminate a key accused in a murder case, has been arrested by the Mumbai crime branch.





MUMBAI: Dismissed sub-inspector Ranjit Kasle, who earlier claimed he was offered a contract to eliminate Walmik Karad, a key accused in the sarpanch Santosh Deshmukh case, has landed in a fresh controversy.The city crime branch arrested Kasle on Friday from Jaitpur in Delhi on charges of spreading communal hatred, defaming public officials, and disseminating obscene content through social media.Unit 3 of the crime branch arrested Kasle and booked him under BNS sections for publishing or circulating false information/rumours, imputations, assertions prejudicial to national integration, defamation, criminal actions intended to insult a woman's modesty, and the Information Technology Act.Interestingly, Kasle is the same policeman who was dismissed from service under Article 311 last month after he made serious allegations against Dhananjay Munde, the former Maharashtra Cabinet Minister, and his close associate Walmik Karad.He also made serious allegations that he was given a contract to eliminate Karad in an encounter. Deshmukh, the sarpanch of Massajog village in Beed district, was abducted and tortured to death on December 9 last year, allegedly for attempting to stop an extortion bid targeting an energy company.The arrest came after Manisha Anil Tupe, a social and political activist from Bhandup, lodged a complaint with the city police alleging that Kasle had been regularly uploading controversial videos on Facebook, making serious and unverified allegations against elected representatives, including a sitting woman minister of the Maharashtra govt.In her complaint, she alleged that in a series of videos posted between May 27 and May 29, Kasle claimed that during his tenure at Marine Drive Police Station during the COVID-19 lockdown, he seized a Lamborghini allegedly carrying drugs.He further insinuated that a Maharashtra Assembly identity card found in the vehicle belonged to a minister and that the case had links to Bollywood personalities and high-profile political figures. In his videos, he promised further “exposés” involving other political leaders. He said he would be uploading the names of the people involved in follow-up videos.""Beyond defamation, the videos were laced with obscene language and inflammatory statements targeting members of the Maratha and OBC communities, raising serious concerns about incitement to communal discord. One particular video contained offensive remarks and caste-based insinuations, prompting swift legal action,"" said an official.Kasle is not new to controversy. Police records show he is a repeat offender with multiple prior cases against him in Ambajogai and Shivajinagar police stations under charges including cheating, criminal breach of trust, and offenses under the SC/ST Atrocities Act.A senior official from the Crime Branch said, “The accused has been misusing social media to spread misinformation and incite hatred among communities. We are examining his entire online footprint and will take strict action as per law.”","Ranjit Kasle arrested on charges of spreading communal hatred, defaming public officials, and disseminating obscene content through social media.

Mexico's first judicial elections stir controversy and confusion among voters,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/mexicos-first-judicial-elections-stir-controversy-and-confusion-among-voters/articleshow/121545350.cms,"A supporter of Lenia Batres, who is running for election for the Mexican Supreme Court, holds an instruction sheet on how to vote, during her closing campaign rally in Mexico City (Image credit: AP)





Mexico is holding its first ever judicial elections on Sunday, stirring controversy and sowing confusion among voters still struggling to understand a process set to transform the country's court system.Mexico's ruling party, Morena, overhauled the court system late last year, fueling protests and criticism that the reform is an attempt by those in power to seize on their political popularity to gain control of the branch of government until now out of their reach.""It's an effort to control the court system, which has been a sort of thorn in the side"" of those in power, said Laurence Patin, director of the legal organization Juicio Justo in Mexico. ""But it's a counter-balance, which exists in every healthy democracy.""Now, instead of judges being appointed on a system of merit and experience, Mexican voters will choose between some 7,700 candidates vying for more than 2,600 judicial positions.Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum and party allies have said the elections are a way to purge the court system of corruption in a country that has long faced high levels of impunity.Critics say the vote could damage democracy and open the judicial system up further to organized crime and other corrupt actors hoping to get a grip on power.That process has only grown more chaotic in the run-up to the vote.Civil society organizations like Defensorxs have raised red flags about a range of candidates running for election, including lawyers who represented some of Mexico's most feared cartel leaders and local officials who were forced to resign from their positions due to corruption scandals.Also among those putting themselves forward are ex-convicts imprisoned for years for drug-trafficking to the United States and a slate of candidates with ties to a religious group whose spiritual leader is behind bars in California after pleading guilty to sexually abusing minors.At the same time, voters have been plagued by confusion over a voting process that Patin warned has been hastily thrown together. Voters often have to choose from sometimes more than a hundred candidates who are not permitted to clearly voice their party affiliation or carry out widespread campaigning.As a result, many Mexicans say they're going into the vote blind. Mexico's electoral authority has investigated voter guides being handed out across the country, in what critics say is a blatant move by political parties to stack the vote in their favor.""Political parties weren't just going to sit with their arms crossed,"" Patin said.Miguel Garcia, a 78-year-old former construction worker, stood in front of the country's Supreme Court on Friday peering at a set of posters, voter guides with the faces and numbers of candidates.He was fiercely scribbling down their names on a small scrap of paper and said that he had traveled across Mexico City to try to inform himself ahead of the vote, but he couldn't find any information other than outside the courthouse.""In the neighborhood where I live, there's no information for us,"" he said. ""I'm confused, because they're telling us to go out and vote but we don't know who to vote for.""","Mexico's ruling party, Morena, overhauled the court system late last year, fueling protests and criticism.

The death toll from widespread floods in central Nigeria rose to more than 150 people on Saturday, local emergency services reported.After torrential rains earlier in the week, flood waters have swept away more than 50 homes in the market town of Mokwa in the central Niger State.Ibrahim Audu Husseini, spokesperson for the Niger State emergency agency told AFP on Friday that he ""expected the toll to rise considerably because there are different rescuers at different locations.""Additionally, more than 3,000 people have been displaced.Nigerian President Bola Tinubu offered his condolences to those affected and said federal agencies had been instructed to help with the emergency response.""I extend my heartfelt condolences to the affected families and the good people of Niger State at this difficult time,"" he said on social media.""Search-and-rescue operations are ongoing, and all relevant federal agencies have been mobilized to support the state government’s efforts,"" Tinubu added.""Relief materials and temporary shelter assistance are being deployed without delay.""Mokwa is a key local hub for traders from the south of the country and farmers from the north.It is located around 220 kilometers (140 miles) west of the capital Abuja.The flooding was triggered by several hours of heavy rain, with the collapse of a nearby dam exacerbating the situation.Nigeria's Meteorological Agency warned of possible flash floods in 15 of Nigeria's 36 states, including Niger State, between Wednesday and Friday.Nigeria's rainy season has only just started and normally lasts around six months.The annual occurrence regularly kills hundreds of people.

Ukraine:







Poles are set to vote on Sunday in a knife-edge presidential election with major implications for the country's role in Europe and for abortion and LGBTQ rights.Warsaw's pro-EU mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, 53, an ally of the centrist government, faces off against nationalist historian Karol Nawrocki, 42.Opinion polls predict an extremely close race with Nawrocki on 50.1 per cent and Trzaskowski on 49.9 per cent, a tiny difference within the margin of error.Polls are open between 0500 GMT and 1900 GMT in the EU and Nato country, which borders Ukraine and has been a key supporter of its neighbour against Russia.An exit poll is expected as soon as ballots close and election officials predict the final result will be known on Monday.A victory for Trzaskowski would be a major boost for the progressive agenda of the government led by Prime Minister Donald Tusk, a former European Council president.It could mean significant social changes such as the introduction of civil partnerships for same-sex couples and an easing of the near-total ban on abortion.Presidents in Poland, a fast-growing economy of 38 million people, have the power to veto legislation and are also the commander-in-chief of the armed forces.Victory for Nawrocki would embolden the populist Law and Justice (PiS) party, which ruled Poland between 2015 and 2023, and could lead to fresh parliamentary elections.Many Nawrocki supporters want stricter curbs on immigration and advocate for conservative values and more sovereignty for the country within the European Union ""We should not give in to European pressure,"" 40-year-old Agnieszka Prokopiuk, a homemaker, said ahead of the vote.""We need to make our own way... and not succumb to trends from the West,"" she told AFP in the city of Biala Podlaska in eastern Poland near the Belarus border.Tomasz Czublun, a 48-year-old mechanic, said: ""The European Union is important but the sovereignty of our country is much more important.""Anna Materska-Sosnowska, a politics expert, called the election ""a real clash of civilisations"" because of the wide policy differences between the candidates.Many Trzaskowski voters support greater integration within the EU and an acceleration of social reforms.Malgorzata Wojciechowska, a tour guide and teacher in her fifties, said Polish women ""unfortunately do not have the same rights as our European friends"".""I hope that Rafal Trzaskowski will relaunch the debate on abortion so that we can finally live in a free country where we can have our own opinion,"" she told AFP.The election is also being closely watched in Ukraine, which is seeking to bolster international diplomatic support in its negotiations with Russia as its resistance to Moscow's invasion grinds on.Nawrocki, an admirer of US President Donald Trump, opposes Nato membership for Kyiv and has called for curbs on benefits for the estimated one million Ukrainian refugees in Poland.He used his last campaign hours on Friday to leave flowers at a monument to Poles killed by Ukrainian nationalists during World War II.""It was a genocide against the Polish people,"" he said.The election's final result is expected to hinge on whether Trzaskowski can mobilise enough supporters and whether far-right voters will cast their ballots for Nawrocki.Far-right candidates got more than 21 per cent of the vote in the election's first round, which Trzaskowski won by a razor-thin margin of 31 per cent against 30 per cent for Nawrocki.","Warsaw's pro-EU mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, 53, faces off against nationalist historian Karol Nawrocki, 42.

The Art Institute of Chicago's director, James Rondeau, is set to return to his position Monday after being temporarily sidelined due to a bizarre and embarrassing incident on an international flight that saw him reportedly strip naked mid-air.Rondeau, who earns more than $1 million annually as the museum's highest-paid employee, was detained by German authorities on April 18 upon landing in Munich. According to reports, he became intoxicated after consuming alcohol and prescription medication, eventually disrobing in-flight aboard a United Airlines flight from Chicago.The 55-year-old museum chief was taken into custody by German police after the plane touched down, sparking an internal crisis at one of the nation's most respected art institutions. Rondeau later took a voluntary leave of absence while the museum launched an independent investigation into the incident.In a statement released through CBS News, Rondeau expressed remorse for the ordeal, ""I deeply regret this incident and the impact it has had on the museum and me and on my colleagues. I have dedicated the past 27 years of my professional career to the Art Institute and I am grateful to have the opportunity to continue furthering its mission.""Despite the public embarrassment, the Art Institute has decided to reinstate Rondeau, citing confidence in his leadership.""Board leadership of the Art Institute of Chicago has conducted an independent investigation of this incident and is confident in James Rondeau’s leadership and ability to continue as the president and director of the museum,"" a museum spokesperson told CBS News.Rondeau has been with the Art Institute since 1998, when he began as an associate curator.

Alyssa’s body was later discovered inside the same home. Due to the condition of the house, her remains were not immediately visible, police said.

However, public records indicate that Rodney Shippy was facing serious financial difficulties. The home, which he and his wife purchased in 2021, was at risk of foreclosure.In January, the US Bank national association filed a foreclosure notice, citing $135,000 in unpaid principal. Court documents show Shippy was given until June to respond to the notice.As the investigation continues, neighbors shared that 10-year-old Logan Shippy had autism and was nonverbal.

It further identified Iran and North Korea as smaller but significant “regional disruptors.”According to the report, Britain was entering “a new era of threat,” as drones, artificial intelligence, and other emerging technologies were transforming the nature of warfare more profoundly than ever before.The analysis is not expected to announce new defence spending commitments but will reaffirm Starmer’s February pledge to raise the defence budget to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, and to 3% in the following parliament. However, the document is likely to support a major medium-term spending increase—potentially exceeding £50 billion in real terms—that may be agreed at the upcoming Nato summit in June.There, Western allies are considering a proposal to raise core defence spending to 3.5% of GDP by 2032, with an additional 1.5% dedicated to cyber and infrastructure efforts, partly in response to mounting pressure from US President Donald Trump.It is also expected to address the issue of British army size, as tensions continue between the ministry of defence and the treasury over whether to commit to increasing troop numbers beyond the current target of 73,000. This comes amid fresh figures revealing that the army's strength has fallen to 70,860 full-time trained soldiers as of 1 April—its lowest level since the Napoleonic era—marking a 2.3% decline over the past year.Meanwhile, US defense secretary Pete Hegseth has also warned Indo-Pacific allies of an ""imminent threat"" from China, reassuring them that they would not face growing military and economic pressure from the country alone.","Britain's defence review has warned against “immediate and pressing” threat from Russia.

Poll What do you think about the appropriateness of political speeches at graduation ceremonies? They are important for raising awareness. They should focus solely on the graduates.

Viral: MIT Grad Wears Arab Headscarf; Torches Alma Mater’s Israel Ties In Viral Speech |Megha Vemuri





At an already fractious time in US academia, an Indian-American undergrad at the famed Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) torched her own alma mater's ties to the Israeli military and spoke up for Palestine in the face of growing pressure from the Trump administration on US institutions to clamp down on criticism of Israel.Megha Vemuri, a senior class president at MIT, did not hold back during a graduation ceremony on Thursday, accusing Israel of trying to ""wipe Palestine off the face of the earth,"" and lamenting ""it is a shame that MIT is a part of it.""""Right now, while we prepare to graduate and move forward with our lives, there are no universities left in Gaza,"" Vemuri, who completed her undergraduate degree in computer science, neuroscience, and linguistics and served as president of the graduating class, said in remarks that was greeted with cheers from students at the convocation.Vemuri trained her guns on MIT itself and recalled that students scored a major victory earlier this year, forcing MIT to end its partnership with Elbit Systems, who are Israel’s largest weapons manufacturer, whose drones and surveillance systems are said to have been widely used in Israeli attacks on Gaza.""The Israeli occupation forces are the only foreign military that MIT has research ties with. As scientists, engineers, academics, and leaders, we have a commitment to support life.Support aid efforts, call for an arms embargo, and keep demanding that MIT cuts the ties,"" Vemuri said.MIT President Sally Kornbluth, who spoke immediately after Vemuri, ignored her criticism of MIT, and while acknowledging the institution valued freedom of expression, she said, ""Today is about the graduates,"" a sentiment shared by critics who accused her of political grandstanding instead of focusing on academics.""Graduation speeches are meant to inspire, not divide. Turning a shared moment into a personal political stage, especially with such a charged issue, is unfair to fellow students,"" one critic wrote on social media, where clips of her speech went viral.Others found her remarks courageous and inspirational. ""Her speech makes me proud as an Indian! Well done here, on the right side of history,"" read one of hundreds of reactions on X, even as more extreme critics doxxed her and warned that she would never be able to get a job.Vemuri's remarks came even as US secretary of state Marco Rubio had announced that the Trump administration would deny visas to foreign nationals who come to the United States to foment hatred against the Jewish community.While few details are available on the young undergrad, she appears to be a US-born daughter of immigrants from India. Her social media profile shows she went to school in Alpharetta, Georgia, home to many healthcare, insurance, and manufacturing companies.","Megha Vemuri, a senior class president at MIT, did not hold back during a graduation ceremony on Thursday.

"Elon Musk's drug use reached extreme, it affected his bladder: Shocking details revealed",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elon-musks-drug-use-reached-extreme-point-it-affected-his-bladder-shocking-details-revealed/articleshow/121516805.cms,"Elon Musk has always been open about taking drugs but he denied ever overdoing it.

Elon Musk has always been open about his drug use







Elon Musk's daily medication box with which he travels has about 20 pills, including stimulant Adderall that is marked separately, a New York Times report claimed citing those who have seen the box. The report chronicled Musk's brief stint in the government that started with Musk throwing himself into the campaign and ended with him exiting the Department of Government Efficiency -- a brainchild of his. The report sad that this period coincided with Musk's family drama along with his heavy drug use. People familiar wit his activities confirmed to the Times that he was using drugs far more intensely than previously known.Elon Musk told people he was taking so much ketamine that it was affecting his bladder, the report said. He also took Ecstasy and psychedelic mushrooms.It was the same time that Musk faced family drama with overlapping romantic relationships and legal battles over his children, their mothers etc.While the NYT report points to an extreme use of drugs, Elon Musk never shied away from accepting that he took drugs. In a 2018 podcast with Joe Rogan, Elon Musk smoked marijuana, prompting severe backlash.Musk has openly discussed using ketamine, a dissociative anesthetic, under a prescription to manage depression. In a 2024 interview, Musk openly admitted that he takes a small dose every other week or less to address ""negative chemical states"" in his brain. He said that he has a prescription that comes from a licensed doctor and he said he needed it as he works 16 hours a day. He also denied overusing it.A 2024 Wall Street Journal report alleged Musk has used recreational drugs, including LSD, cocaine, ecstasy, and psychedelic mushrooms, often at private parties where attendees sign NDAs or surrender phones.The NYT report claimed that he has been using ketamine daily, often mixing it with other drugs.","Elon Musk's daily medication box with which he travels has about 20 pills, including stimulant Adderall that is marked separately.

JD Vance speaks up amid H-1B row: 'This idea that American citizens don't have talent to do great things...',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jd-vance-speaks-up-amid-h-1b-row-this-idea-that-american-citizens-dont-have-talent-to-do-great-things-/articleshow/121520214.cms,"JD Vance said what he thinks about foreign students in US.





Vice President JD Vance broke his silence amid the ongoing H-1B row and the controversy over the Donald Trump administration's crackdown on universities. In an interview with the Newsmax, Vance dismissed criticisms that the crackdown will lead to an academic brain drain in the US.""First of all, I've heard a lot of the criticisms, the fear that we're going to have a brain drain,"" Vance said. ""If you go back to the '50s and '60s, the American space program, the program that was the first to put a human being on the surface of the moon, was built by American citizens — some German and Jewish scientists who had come over during World War II, but mostly, by American citizens who built an incredible space program with American talent,"" Vance said.""This idea that American citizens don't have the talent to do great things ... do you have to import a foreign class of [students] and professors to do these things? I just reject it. I just think we should invest in our own people. We can do a lot of good.""Vance's comments came amid a fresh row over H-1B as the USCIS revealed that they have selected 120.141 H-1B visa applications for 2026. Several companies, including Walmart, announced job cuts, enraging US workers as they allege that the administration is not doing enough to put Americans first -- as companies are still relying on cheap labor from outside.Moving on to his second point, Vance defended the crackdown on universities and said, ""These institutions do an important job; but if you back up and look at American higher education over the past 20 or 30 years, there are a few incontrovertible facts.""""No. 1, the hard sciences, particularly biology, we have a terrible what is called a reproducibility crisis, meaning most of the papers that are published in biology don't replicate; they're not good science. So even our elite universities are not often doing good science.""Second important point, these institutions — sometimes by their own admission — are engaging in explicit racial discrimination, often against whites and Asians in explicit violation of the Civil Rights Act. If the people's government can't come in, given those problems, and say, 'Look, we've got to have some accountability here; you can't violate the Civil Rights Act,'"" he continued.""We've got to make sure that if we're funding science with federal money, you're actually doing good science. That's called accountability.""Vance said this is not 'fascism' and if the American taxpayer is frustrated with these universities, they have got to reform. ""What they're doing instead, what too many of them are doing and saying, 'Aw, the Trump administration, this is dictatorial, this is fascism.' No, this is democratic accountability, and I think universities ought to see it as an opportunity. If they do that, they're going to get better, and the American people will be better off because of it,"" he said.","Vice President JD Vance broke his silence amid the ongoing H-1B row and the controversy over the Donald Trump administration's crackdown on universities.
