'State sponsor of terrorism': Ex-diplomat slams Pakistan; says Islamabad glorifying terrorists on I-Day,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/state-sponsor-of-terrorism-ex-diplomat-slams-pakistan-says-islamabad-glorifying-terrorists-on-i-day/articleshow/123341718.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Former diplomat Veena Sikri has strongly criticised Pakistan for honouring terrorists during its Independence Day events, calling it yet another example of Islamabad’s deep-rooted support for terror groups.Speaking to news agency ANI, Sikri described Pakistan as a “terror monger” state and warned that India must remain alert.“We have always said that Pakistan is a state sponsor of terrorism. It is a matter of great concern to India. And our Prime Minister has now declared the new normal that every act of terror will be considered an act of war. So this is a big warning to Pakistan,” Sikri was quoted as saying by ANI.She cautioned that Islamabad must not allow its army or groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba to operate, stressing that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s words amount to a “huge warning” against any further misadventure.""So I hope they will heed that warning. What they did on their own Independence Day on 14th August just proves the point. They have always been supporting terrorism. They have always been supporting terrorist groups, giving them money,"" she said.Sikri also alleged that Pakistan was using International Monetary Fund (IMF) funds to rebuild infrastructure destroyed during India’s Operation Sindoor . “They are now offered to build all their buildings which were destroyed during the Operation Sindoor with government money.So all the money going from the IMF is going for this purpose. It is terrible, and the world should take note of that,” she said.In his Independence Day address, Prime Minister Modi hailed the success of Operation Sindoor and saluted the armed forces for striking terror camps in Pakistan. He recalled the Pahalgam attack in Jammu and Kashmir where “husbands were killed in front of their wives and fathers were killed in front of their children after asking their religion,” saying the operation was India’s answer to such brutality. “Our brave jawans punished the enemy beyond its imagination,” PM Modi said from the Red Fort.The Prime Minister also underlined that Operation Sindoor had inflicted “heavy losses” on Pakistan and marked a new phase in India’s fight against cross-border terrorism. Rejecting Islamabad’s “nuclear blackmail,” he reaffirmed that India would retaliate decisively against any future attacks.PM Modi further criticised the Indus Water Treaty , calling it “unjust and one-sided,” and declared that “blood and water cannot flow together,” promising India’s farmers full rights over the country’s river waters.",Former diplomat Veena Sikri has strongly criticised Pakistan for honouring terrorists during its Independence Day events.

At first, some expressed concern about losses, but they soon agreed, recognising the larger benefit for children's health,"" he said.The trigger for the ban was the realisation that many drug addicts were mixing narcotics with energy drinks, said Singh. The small community was alarmed. ""Moreover, doctors have been warning about the ill-effects of these drinks on children.They were being sold in large quantities,"" added the sarpanch.Beyond energy drinks, the panchayat passed several other strict resolutions.

India appreciates 'progress' at Trump-Putin Alaska meet,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-appreciates-progress-at-trump-putin-alaska-meet/articleshow/123341062.cms,"Trump and Putin

NEW DELHI: Even though the Trump-Putin Alaska summit concluded without an agreement to end the Russia-Ukraine war, India appreciated the ""progress"" made in the meeting between the US and Russian presidents, saying in an official statement their leadership in the pursuit of peace is ""highly commendable"".The Indian govt is hoping that Trump's claims about great progress being made in Alaska, and the talk about a comprehensive peace agreement even in the absence of a ceasefire, will ease the US pressure on India to review its energy ties with Russia.India welcomes the summit meeting in Alaska between US President Donald Trump and President Vladimir Putin of Russia, said the Indian govt. ""India appreciates the progress made in the summit. The way forward can only be through dialogue and diplomacy. The world wants to see an early end to the conflict in Ukraine,"" it added.Facing an additional 25% tariff/secondary sanctions from the US for its energy imports from Russia, India would have liked to see a quick end to the war in Ukraine as it would have rendered these sanctions untenable. The Trump administration imposed the additional tariffs, which will come into effect on Aug 27, accusing the Indian govt of funding Russia's war on Ukraine.Just before the meeting, Trump said Russia had lost India as its ""oil client"" suggesting the US could do a rethink on the secondary sanctions issue. After the meeting, asked whether he still planned to penalise countries like China for trade with Russia, Trump said because of what happened in the summit with Putin, he didn't have to think about it. ""Now, I may have to think about it in two weeks or three weeks or something, but we don't have to think about that right now. I think, you know, the meeting went very well,"" said Trump, raising hopes that secondary sanctions on India too may not be implemented.US treasury secretary Scott Bessent raised the stakes for India, ahead of the Trump-Putin summit, by saying the sanctions on India could go up if the Alaska meeting did not go well. India sees these sanctions as unreasonable and unjustified as other countries importing from Russia have been spared such action.An agency report from New York said Trump had signalled he won't impose additional tariffs on India as he had said that Russia just lost an ""oil client"" in India.""Well, he (Putin) lost an oil client, so to speak, which is India, which was doing about 40% of the oil. China, as you know, is doing a lot...And, if I did what's called a secondary sanction, or a secondary tariff, it would be very devastating from their standpoint. If I have to do it, I'll do it. Maybe I won't have to do it,"" Trump had told Fox News.","India welcomes the summit meeting in Alaska between US President Donald Trump and President Vladimir Putin of Russia.

NEW DELHI: NCERT's newly released Partition Horrors Remembrance Day modules have triggered a political storm by explicitly naming Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Congress and then Viceroy Lord Mountbatten as ""culprits"" behind India's division in 1947.The supplementary modules - separate versions for classes VI-VIII and IX-XII - are not part of regular textbooks but designed for discussions, debates and projects. They open with PM Narendra Modi's 2021 message declaring Aug 14 as Partition Horrors Remembrance Day: ""Partition's pains can never be forgotten. Millions of our sisters and brothers were displaced and many lost their lives due to mindless hate and violence. ""In a section titled ""Who Was Responsible for Partition?"", the secondary-stage module states: ""Historically, three actors were responsible for Partition: 1. Jinnah, who demanded it. 2. The Congress, which accepted it. 3. Mountbatten, who formalised and implemented it."" The text criticises Mountbatten for advancing the transfer of power from June 1948 to Aug 1947. ""Due to it many essential arrangements that should have preceded Partition were never completed.The Partition became disorderly and chaotic.""The framing has drawn sharp criticism, with Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera rejecting the NCERT's narrative.

CHASOTI: A two-storey wooden home crumbled in seconds. Boulders roared down the hillside, mud and water swallowed fields at Chasoti village in J&K’s Kishtwar district. “It was as if mountain itself was coming down,” said 26-year-old arts student Piyra Singh, who fled into maize fields as his house collapsed behind him.By the time silence returned, his uncle and cousin were dead, two visiting pilgrims missing, and his family in shock. “My brother kept touching me, asking, ‘are you alive?’” Singh said.Chasoti is now rubble. Flash floods following a cloudburst killed Thursday at least 60 people, injured 160, and left up to 70 unaccounted for. Chief secretary Atul Dullo said 72 missing reports had been filed. MLA Sunil Sharma warned numbers could be higher. Rescue workers pulled out four more bodies Saturday.Everywhere, grief hangs heavy. Pawan Kumar, a bulldozer driver from Rajouri, has been searching since Aug 14 for 14 relatives who came for the Mata Machail pilgrimage. “Many bodies have been pulled out,” he said, breaking down when one stretcher finally carried his mother’s remains.At a community kitchen, Jaffar Hussain of Doda described watching 30 people vanish in a matter of seconds.“When I looked again, there was none,” he said. Such accounts fuel fears that actual missing numbers could cross official estimates.On Saturday morning, CM Omar Abdullah arrived to placate restless families demanding answers. “They have been waiting for two days. They want to know if their family members will come out alive or not,” he said, promising relentless search efforts. He pegged missing figures between 70 and 80. “It will fluctuate a little, but I do not think the number will reach 500 or 1,000 as some are claiming,” he said.Rescue teams of SDRF and NDRF are digging through boulders with excavators while revenue officers note names of missing. Relatives wait at the edge, weeping. Politicians shuttle in and out.Union minister Jitendra Singh visited the injured at GMC Jammu. He said PM Narendra Modi is “personally monitoring” relief. Sixty-seven patients were admitted, 15 discharged Saturday, leaving 52 under treatment. Singh announced an MP help-desk to provide food, medicines, and transport. “This was a natural calamity no one was prepared for,” he said.For survivors like Piyra Singh, life is upended. “Our homes are gone, our employment is gone, my uncle and cousin are dead,” he said. “I thought I will continue studying. But now I am burdened with responsibilities. I don’t know if we will live in this village now.”","Flash floods following a cloudburst killed at least 60 people, injured 160, and left up to 70 unaccounted for.

US proposes 'Nato-style' security guarantee for Ukraine; Putin signals settlement — what it means,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-proposes-nato-style-security-guarantee-for-ukraine-putin-signals-settlement-what-it-means/articleshow/123333210.cms,"So what's being proposed?



What did the Alaska summit yield?







The United States has suggested giving Ukraine Nato-style security guarantees without allowing the country to join the alliance, a diplomatic source told AFP on Saturday.The proposal surfaced after a series of calls between US President Donald Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders.According to the diplomatic source, the US has proposed a non-Nato Article 5-type guarantee for Ukraine—meaning: a promise of collective defence-like support akin to Nato's, but without formal alliance membership. It’s a way to reassure Ukraine without triggering the full legal obligations that come with joining Nato.The security is said to have reportedly discussed with Russian President Vladimir Putin. “As one of the security guarantees for Ukraine, the American side proposed a non-Nato Article 5 type guarantee, supposedly agreed with (Russian leader Vladimir) Putin,” the source said.The move comes a day after Trump’s high-profile meeting with Putin in Alaska ended without a breakthrough on ending the war, now in its fourth year. Trump later argued that the only path to peace was a direct accord, not a temporary ceasefire. “It was determined by all that the best way to end the horrific war between Russia and Ukraine is to go directly to a Peace Agreement, which would end the war, and not a mere Ceasefire Agreement, which often times do not hold up,” he wrote on his social media site Truth Social.Zelenskyy confirmed he would travel to Washington on Monday for talks with Trump. He described their conversation as “long and substantive.” He said the two would “discuss all of the details regarding ending the killing and the war.” It will be his first visit to the United States since a tense Oval Office exchange with Trump in February.Zelenskyy stressed that Europe must remain involved in security discussions. “It is important that Europeans are involved at every stage to ensure reliable security guarantees together with America,” he said. He also noted “positive signals from the American side regarding participation in guaranteeing Ukraine’s security.”Trump has proposed a possible trilateral summit involving himself, Zelenskyy and Putin. The Ukrainian leader welcomed the idea, saying “key issues can be discussed at the level of leaders, and a trilateral format is suitable for this.”On the battlefield, matters remain tense. Russia launched overnight attacks with one ballistic missile and 85 Shahed drones, of which Ukraine’s Air Force said 61 were shot down. Strikes hit areas in Sumy, Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk and Chernihiv. Russia’s defence ministry claimed its air defences destroyed 29 Ukrainian drones over its territory and the Sea of Azov.","Proposal surfaced after a series of calls between US President Donald Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders.

‘Incredibly isolated’: New Zealand mom and son freed after weeks in US immigration detention – who is she?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/incredibly-isolated-new-zealand-mom-and-son-freed-after-weeks-in-us-immigration-detention-who-is-she/articleshow/123340405.cms,"



A US mother and her 6-year-old son were released this week after spending more than three weeks in US immigration detention, following a brief trip to Canada and what her attorney called a minor paperwork mistake.Sarah Shaw, a 33-year-old New Zealand citizen who has lived legally in the U.S. since 2021, was detained at the Blaine, Washington, border checkpoint while returning from Vancouver, where she had dropped her two older children off for a flight to New Zealand to visit their grandparents.Shaw’s attorney, Minda Thorward, told CNN that Shaw didn’t realize her travel permit—part of a “combo card” granting both work and travel authorization—had expired. Although her son’s documents were valid, both were taken into custody by Customs and Border Protection and transferred nearly 2,000 miles away to the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas.In June, Shaw received confirmation of her work permit renewal, but mistakenly believed it also extended her travel authorization – a “minor administrative paperwork error” – according to her lawyer.“She had completely re-established herself.She had a full-time job, an apartment, adopted a dog, a new boyfriend, and the kids were in school and doing great,” Thorward said. “She made a mistake, but she has no previous convictions – none. This is a very clean case.”Shaw, who works for the state of Washington and had just renewed her work permit, mistakenly believed the renewal also extended her travel authorization. Her attorney said she applied for humanitarian parole, which would have allowed her to return home, but was denied. Requests for her boyfriend or a friend to collect her son were also rejected.A friend of Shaw’s, Victoria Besancon, told CNN Shaw has spent three weeks in a cramped detention facility, feeling “incredibly isolated.” “Each room contains 5 to 6 bunk beds, and rooms are locked from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m.,” Besancon told CNN, adding that she has been able to phone Shaw daily and recently video chat.Her son, who had expected to spend summer vacation at home, spent weeks confined indoors with limited activities. “There’s not a lot for kids to do—maybe some coloring books,” Thorward said.Shaw arrived in the U.S. in 2021, married a citizen that year, and later filed an I-360 petition after the marriage ended. Her application remains pending. She has since built a life in Washington—working full time, raising her children, and preparing to begin a master’s degree in psychology this month at Northwest University.A CBP spokesperson defended the detention, saying individuals with expired parole documents must be held under immigration law. ICE has insisted its family facilities are safe and equipped with medical, dental, and mental health services, though critics argue the conditions are traumatizing for children.New Zealand’s foreign ministry confirmed it was in contact with Shaw but declined to share details, citing privacy.","Sarah Shaw, a 33-year-old New Zealand citizen, has lived legally in the U.S. since 2021.

Martina Navratilova, the famous former tennis player, spoke up on August 14, 2025, on her X account. She shared how upset she was with President Donald J. Trump. Trump had taken over the Washington, D.C. , police force and brought in 800 National Guard troops, saying the move was needed to fight rising violent crime in the city. But crime was actually at a low. Navratilova shared a Rolling Stone report and wrote plainly: “He would love nothing more than an excuse to open fire on protesters.” She once said, calling out Trump’s policy,One of the all-time greats, Martina Navratilova, renounced her former nation and is now a United States citizen. She achieved 18 Grand Slams overall and won her first at Wimbledon in 1978 against Chris Evert.Under Section 740 of the DC Home Rule Act, President Trump signed an executive order on August 11, 2025. He said violent crime was surging and took temporary control of the Metropolitan Police Department. He also sent in 800 National Guard soldiers to the capital.But news outlets like PolitiFact and local officials, including Mayor Muriel Bowser, said crime had actually gone down since 2023.Studies found violent crime dropped by about 26–35 per cent in recent years.In response, many residents took to the streets. They called the military move harsh and anti-democratic. Against this backdrop, Navratilova’s warning rang out: she said Trump looked for any excuse to silence or harm protesters. Her words echoed the concern many felt.Also Read: “More than any American Culture”: Martina Navratilova once shared how Chris Evert’s Catholic upbringing shaped her tennis image Martina Navratilova, who moved to America in 1981, also spoke recently about immigration.

Duke of York Prince Andrew mistreated his staff members and will summon his protection officer or maids to pick up his golf balls or tissues to pick that up, the royal biographer Andrew Lonie claimed in one of the episodes in Channel 5's documentary, Andrew and Fergie: The Duke and Duchess of Excess.The new documentary goes into the lives of Prince Andrew and his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, exploring their relationship, lavish lifestyle, business ventures, Ferguson’s financial struggles, and their controversial links to Jeffrey Epstein, as per Express UK reported.During the episode, royal biographer Lonie said, ""Andrew was particularly horrible to staff; he doesn't seem to see them as normal people. He treats them as basically subordinates to be bossed around. I think he’s very narcissistic and everything is about him.""Lonie further added, ""He’ll summon his protection officer to pick up his golf balls after he's teed them down the fairway, he will summon maids from four floors down to open the curtains. He will drop tissues he's used on the floor and expect people to pick that up.""The documentary continued: ""Andrew has not commented on the new claims about his behaviour towards staff.""These bombshells were exposed in a new book about the disgraced royal and his family, ""The Rise and Fall Of The House of York"", by Andrew Lownie.Earlier this year, it was also reported that the Duke had previously asked for a member of staff to be moved because he ""disliked a mole on the man's face."" This claim was made by royal author Tom Quinn, who wrote about the royal's temper in ""The Times"". He penned: ""It’s true that some royals can display acts of ill temper. One former servant recalled how Prince Andrew insisted on a member of staff being transferred because he disliked a mole on the man’s face.

A Palestinian woman, who was evacuated from Gaza to Italy for treatment after suffering from extreme malnutrition, has died at a hospital in Pisa, officials said.Marah Abu Zuhri, 20, traveled with her mother to Pisa on an overnight flight on Wednesday as part of an Italian government evacuation programme. The University Hospital of Pisa said she went into cardiac arrest and died on Friday, less than two days after her arrival.She had a “very complex clinical picture” and was “in a profound state of organic wasting,” stated doctors of the hospital, as per the Guardian. The hospital did not provide further details about her condition, but Italian news agencies, citing medical sources, reported that she had been suffering from severe malnutrition.Thirty-one patients and their companions arrived this week in Rome, Milan, and Pisa, many suffering from severe congenital conditions, injuries, or amputations, as per the Italian foreign ministry.Since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas, Italy has evacuated and received more than 180 children and young people from the besieged Gaza Strip.The UN has raised alarms over widespread malnutrition in Gaza, with experts supported by the organisation warning in a report last month that a “worst-case scenario” of famine is already unfolding.The UN World Food Programme reported in July that one-third of Gaza’s population endures days without food, while around half a million people are facing imminent starvation.“The worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out in the Gaza Strip,” said the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) last month urging an immediate ceasefire to ease “widespread starvation.”Israel’s defence ministry said that it will start supplying Gaza City residents with tents and other equipment on Sunday ahead of relocating them to designated “safe zones”. The announcement came shortly after the government confirmed plans to occupy Gaza City, followed by days of intense bombardment in Zeitoun, the city’s largest district.The situation in Zeitoun was “catastrophic”, a municipal spokesperson was quoted as saying by the BBC, citing mass displacement after six consecutive days of heavy Israeli airstrikes, shelling, and demolitions.There have been more than 250 instances of hunger-related deaths in the war-ravaged territory since the start of the conflict in October 2023. Eleven people died from malnutrition last week, as per the health ministry.“There is no policy of starvation in Gaza, and there is no starvation in Gaza,” Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said last month.","Marah Abu Zuhri, 20, traveled with her mother to Pisa on an overnight flight on Wednesday as part of an Italian government evacuation programme.

In midtown Manhattan, a Queens couple proved that not even the roar of a protest could overshadow their wedding day.Nicole and Richard Uraga, both 30, tied the knot at the main branch of the New York Public Library in Bryant Park, entering the iconic building just before over 700 pro-Palestine protesters gathered with signs, loud music and bombastic political chants.“When we came out, the whole protest was going on and they were banging and screaming up,” said Nicole. “But nothing can stop love,” the groom told The New York Post.The Uragas entered the building, exchanged their “I do’s” and reemerged outside as husband and wife into protesters swarming the entrance of the library.As the newlyweds took pictures near the steps celebrating their union, the protesters chanted “From the River to the Sea” and banged pots, pans and metal bowls. However, the demonstrators’ shrill shrieks could not disturb their newly minted marital bliss.“We did not let the protest get in the way of our marriage,” Nicole said. “It’s a day we’ve planned and we’ve hired a photographer and officiant and it’s a day that means something to us, August 16. So we decided to keep going on with our ceremony,” she added.The couple have been together for over 11 years and secured this date four months in advance.","Nicole and Richard Uraga, both 30, tied the knot at the main branch of the New York Public Library in Bryant Park.

First Lady Melania Trump wrote a “peace letter” to Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling on him to protect children and future generations by ending the war in Ukraine.The letter was hand-delivered to the Russian leader by US President Donald Trump ahead of his summit with Putin at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska on Friday, according to Fox News.First lady’s message emphasized the war’s devastating effect on children, describing them as “caught in the crosshairs” of the violence.Her letter began with “Dear President Putin, Every child shares the same quiet dreams in their heart, whether born randomly into a nation’s rustic countryside or a magnificent city-center. They dream of love, possibility, and safety from danger.”“As parents, it is our duty to nurture the next generation’s hope. As leaders, the responsibility to sustain our children extends beyond the comfort of a few”, Melania wrote.The letter marked the first lady’s second involvement in foreign affairs with the Eastern European power. Melania played a role in convincing her husband to increase military aid to Ukraine and adopt a tougher stance on Russia in dealings related to the protracted war.Calling children “a purity, an innocence which stands above geography, government, and ideology,” Mrs.Trump urged Putin to act. “Mr. Putin, you can singlehandedly restore their melodic laughter,” she wrote. “In protecting the innocence of these children, you will do more than serve Russia alone, you serve humanity itself.”The letter concluded with a time-bound note to act on the current situation. “Such a bold idea transcends all human division, and you, Mr. Putin, are fit to implement this vision with a stroke of the pen today. It is time.”The letter was presented to Putin just before the Alaska summit.Trump described the Alaska meeting as “extremely productive,” while clarifying that no formal agreement was reached. Both leaders gave positive accounts of the meeting, though no signed deal emerged.Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is expected to travel to Washington DC on Monday to meet President Trump.","US First Lady pens 'peace letter' to Putin; urges protection of children, future generations.

‘Puts lives at risk’: Man dies attempting to flee ICE raid in California; dozens honour Montoya with march,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/puts-lives-at-risk-man-dies-attempting-to-flee-ice-raid-in-california-dozens-honour-montoya-with-march/articleshow/123341099.cms,"AP file photo





A man fleeing an immigration raid at a Home Depot in Southern California was struck by a vehicle and killed on a freeway on Thursday as federal agents closed in, authorities said.The victim has been identified as Roberto Carlos Montoya Valdés, 52, of Guatemala, by the National Day Laborer Organizing Network.Montoya fled a Home Depot in Monrovia, about 20 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles, when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents launched their operation Thursday morning, stated Monrovia city manager Dylan Feik.A local police officer observed the raid after the department received a report of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity in the area, Feik was quoted as saying by NBC News. During the operation, an individual ran onto the 210 Freeway, he said.Moments later, the fire department and emergency crews were dispatched to a report of a pedestrian struck by a vehicle.Montoya was reportedly attempting to cross north across the eastbound lanes of Interstate 210 when he was struck by an SUV travelling around 60 mph in the far-left lane. He was struck by the vehicle’s front right side, sustained severe injuries, and later died at a hospital.The individual who ran onto the freeway was “not being pursued by any DHS law enforcement,” ICE was quoted as saying by CNN.“We do not know their legal status. We were not aware of this incident or notified by California Highway Patrol until hours after operations in the area had concluded.”The company is not “notified that ICE activities are going to happen, and we aren’t involved in the operations,” Beth Marlowe, a Home Depot spokesperson, was quoted as saying by NBC News.In a statement shared on his Instagram story, State Assemblymember John Harabedian, who represents Monrovia, said 10 people were detained in the raid. ""Raids like this do not make our streets safer — they terrorize families, instill fear, and put lives at risk,"" he said.“CHP can confirm that the incident occurred within the vicinity of a federal enforcement operation,” stated the California Highway Patrol, which is investigating the incident. “However, CHP cannot confirm the connection between the enforcement operation and the fatality at this time.”Dozens gathered in the parking lot of the Monrovia Home Depot for a solemn march honoring Montoya on Friday.“We’re here to just to lift up his humanity, to say his name … and to say that this cannot happen anymore,” Rev. Francisco Garcia, who co-chairs the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles’ Sacred Resistance ministry, was quoted as saying by CNN.Immigration authorities have focused many of their recent operations on Home Depot stores and other home improvement retailers where day laborers often gather.Enforcement Removal Operations agents carried out a “targeted enforcement operation” last week, at a Home Depot in Washington, DC, as part of the Trump administration’s broader crackdown on immigrants and unhoused people in the city.","The victim has been identified as Roberto Carlos Montoya Valdés, 52, of Guatemala, by the National Day Laborer Organizing Network.

Fraud probe: New Orleans mayor indicted on multiple charges; accused of hiding romantic relationship with her bodyguard,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fraud-probe-new-orleans-mayor-indicted-on-multiple-charges-accused-of-hiding-romantic-relationship-with-her-bodyguard/articleshow/123326552.cms,"New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell (AP image)





A federal grand jury on Friday indicted New Orleans mayor LaToya Cantrell on charges of conspiracy, fraud and obstruction, stemming from allegations that she tried to hide a romantic relationship with her bodyguard.The indictment marks the conclusion of a multi-year federal investigation into Cantrell, the city’s first female mayor in its 300-year history.Her bodyguard, Jeffrey Vappie, has pleaded not guilty to charges of wire fraud and making false statements. Prosecutors allege that Vappie hid the relationship with Cantrell while submitting false payroll records claiming he was on duty. Vappie, who retired from the police department last year, is scheduled to stand trial in January.Federal authorities say Cantrell and Vappie exchanged encrypted messages through an app to avoid detection and deleted the conversations afterward. Both have maintained that their relationship was strictly professional.Acting US Attorney Michael Simpson described the case as a “three-year fraud scheme that we allege exploited their public authority and positions.” He said Cantrell arranged for Vappie to attend 14 trips, claiming these were occasions when they were “truly alone.”The indictment states that in 2021, Cantrell and Vappie “developed a personal and intimate relationship” and allegedly used their public positions to hide it and create opportunities to spend time together. Simpson added that Cantrell falsely claimed in a 2021 affidavit that her phone automatically deleted messages, when the function was only activated in December 2022 after media scrutiny.Following photos taken by a private citizen showing Cantrell and Vappie dining together and drinking wine, Cantrell reportedly filed a police report and sought a restraining order.Cantrell will leave the office in January. Her second term has been marked by clashes with City Council members and a failed recall effort in 2022.“This is a sad day for the people of New Orleans,” said Monet Brignac, a spokesperson for City Council President JP Morrell. “Our thoughts and prayers are with the Cantrell family as they navigate through this difficult time.”Cantrell has not posted on her X account since July 15, when she reported that there have been historic declines in crime in the city. Political observers note that her public profile has diminished in recent months due to disputes with the city council and restrictions on her executive powers approved by voters.Cantrell and her supporters argue that she has been unfairly targeted as a Black woman and held to a different standard than male officials. Earlier this year, she described some of the treatment she received as “very disrespectful, insulting, in some cases kind of unimaginable.”","New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell indicted on charges of conspiracy, fraud and obstruction.

US President Donald Trump said that his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin , reportedly described the 2020 presidential elections as “rigged” because of mail-in voting.“Vladimir Putin said your election was rigged because you have mail-in voting. He said no country has mail-in voting. It's impossible to have mail-in voting and have honest elections,” Trump said in an interview with Fox News on Friday.Trump also reiterated his claim that there would not have been a war between Russia and Ukraine, and millions of lives would have been saved if he won the 2020 elections.""And if you have won, we wouldn't have had a war. You'd have all these people, millions of people, alive now instead of dead,"" Trump said in the interview.Following a closed-door meeting with Putin in Alaska that lasted more than three hours, Trump described the talk as “warm” and said that he agreed on a lot of points with Putin and they are pretty close to making a deal on the ongoing conflict.When asked for his advice to Kyiv, Trump strongly urged Ukraine to strike a deal, stressing the imbalance of power between the two countries. ""Make the deal. Gotta make a deal. Yeah.Look, Russia is a very big power and they're not. They're great soldiers and they have great. But, you know, they also had the best equipment. You know, they had our equipment,” Trump said.Putin has previously said that the “crisis in Ukraine,” referring to Russia’s full-scale military offensive, might not have happened if Trump had been the US president at that time.""I cannot but agree with him that if he had been president, if his victory hadn't been stolen in 2020, then maybe there would not have been the crisis in Ukraine that emerged in 2022,"" Putin said earlier this year, as per a state TV reporter.Trump also previously criticised former president Joe Biden ’s handling of the crisis as “not good”. “I always felt, so when I left, there wasn't even a chance that this would happen. When Biden got involved, I won't say whether or not he handled it properly, but obviously it wasn't good, because the war started,"" Trump said.“I think if I didn't win the election, he would have gotten all of Ukraine. I think he would have taken all of Ukraine,"" he added.Trump previously demanded the appointment of a special prosecutor to examine the 2020 election, which he lost to Democrat Joe Biden, once again repeating an unfounded claim of widespread fraud.“Biden was grossly incompetent, and the 2020 election was a total FRAUD!” he said through a post on social media. “The evidence is MASSIVE and OVERWHELMING. A Special Prosecutor must be appointed. This cannot be allowed to happen again in the United States of America! Let the work begin!”The cybersecurity division of the Department of Homeland Security declared the election “the most secure in American history,” reported Al Jazeera.","US President Donald Trump said that his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, reportedly described the 2020 presidential elections as “rigged” because of mail-in voting.

US Attorney General Pam Bondi who is temporarily overseeing Washington DC’s police at President Donald Trump ’s request had announced on Thursday that the Department of Justice (DOJ) has sent letters to sanctuary jurisdictions across the country. These jurisdictions have one week to comply with federal immigration laws or face potential legal action. Bondi contrasted South Carolina’s cooperation with Democratic-leaning states like New York and California.Bondi was in Greenville, South Carolina, for a panel discussion with State Attorney General Alan Wilson, members of Congress and local law enforcement officials. She had confirmed that letters had been sent to 32 mayors and several governors, warning them to follow federal policies or face DOJ action, as reported by Fox News.In a social media post on X, Bondi announced that DOJ has sent ""demand letters"" to sanctuary cities, counties and states as a “key step” in eliminating sanctuary policies from California to New York."" Threatening lawsuits, she said that ""any sanctuary jurisdiction that continues to put illegal aliens ahead of American citizens can either come to the table or see us in court.""The announcement comes amid concerns about law enforcement staffing in sanctuary cities. Following Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani ’s primary victory in New York, the New York City Police Department reportedly saw a surge in retirement filings.Bondi had also spoken out against current Mayor Eric Adams before, criticizing the city for being a sanctuary city. She stressed the importance of strong leadership for officer safety and urged federal, state and local governments to support law enforcement.Bondi specifically mentioned a letter sent to California Governor Gavin Newsom, warning that officials obstructing federal immigration enforcement could face criminal charges. The letter stressed the importance of cooperation between federal, state and local agencies to enforce immigration law and protect national security.She also praised South Carolina as a model of cooperation among federal, state and local law enforcement. She cited recent operations, including the arrest of a Sinaloa Cartel member after a large cocaine seizure in Myrtle Beach and the largest fentanyl seizure in the state’s history, which involved coordinated efforts by DEA agents, local sheriffs and state police. The seized fentanyl was estimated to have the potential to kill 36 million people and a street value of $1.7 million.Several states, including California, New York, Colorado and Illinois, have already faced lawsuits over their immigration policies.

The State Department made a major announcement of halting all visitor visas for people from Gaza for the time being, as it conducts a full and thorough review of the ""process and procedures"" used to issue medial-humanitarian visas in recent days.“All visitor visas for individuals from Gaza are being stopped while we conduct a full and thorough review of the process and procedures used to issue a small number of temporary medical-humanitarian visas in recent days,” the department wrote in a statement posted to X.The announcement came after MAGA activist Laura Loomer ranted for a day how Palestinians have been entering the country via a humanitarian organization through various airports.

TOI correspondent from Washington:





Absent a formal agreement, statements or read-outs, analysts unpacked everything from choreography of the arrival to body language at the meeting to read the tea leaves, with the broad consensus being Putin conceded nothing while overcoming his pariah status in the west with a meeting on American territory. Some critics described Trump's effort as ""low energy,"" recalling his warning that he would walk out if the talks if Putin was not conciliatory and his claim that he would know within two minutes of meeting if the Russian leader was ready to make a deal.But after nearly three hours of talks, Putin appeared to have engaged the realtor-turned-President as salesman or messenger for relaying his terms to EU leaders and Zelensky, while tacitly making his way back to the global mainstream. Trump repeatedly referred to Putin as ""Vladimir"" and exuded friendly vibes -- even deference -- towards the Russian leader, in contrast to the intimidation he subjects many other leaders to.Putin too cosied up to Trump, endorsing the US President's claim that there would have been no war if he (Trump), rather than Biden, had won a second term in 2020. When Trump suggested that they will probably be seeing each other again very soon, the Russian leader quickly interjected with ""Next time in Moscow.""Trump: ""I'll get a little heat on that one... but I could see it possibly happening.""Earlier, Trump warmly welcomed Putin at the Elmendorf Air Force Base (AFB), clapping as the Russia leader alighted from his plane and walked a red carpet that looked as if it had been retrieved from a thrift store and rolled out. Putin, who has a black belt in judo, held firm as Trump, who towered several inches above him, rolled out his ""yank shake.""It was the Russian leader's first formal visit to the US since 2007 -- not counting a trip to the United Nations in 2015 -- and it effectively ended his isolation in the west. Putin has visited India half a dozen times in the same period, including as state guest for India's Republic Day in 2007, and three visits tied to the annual Russia-India summit.While MAGA partisans saw Trump's glad-handling, a flypast by a B-2 stealth bomber flanked by four F-35s, and a line-up of F-22 Raptors on the tarmac as ""power moves"" and ""epic flex"" by the US President, critics saw it as a sign of undeserving respect for the visiting dignitary. Both leaders looked up to the sky to see the timed fly-past with Trump trying to say something to Putin over the roar of the jets before they took the Presidential limousine nicknamed the ""Beast"" for talks that extended longer than anticipated given lack of clear outcome.Critics, mostly on the Democratic/Moderate/Liberal spectrum, excoriated Trump for ""folding"" before the Russian leader, saying the meeting was high on optics but low on substance, and it would eventually result in throwing Ukraine under the bus. But many MAGA faithful argued that there was no compelling reason the US has to carry the burden of European insecurity and treat Russia, an Arctic neighbor, as an enemy, and concessions by Ukraine and EU was inevitable if there has to be peace.",Putin appeared to have engaged the realtor-turned-President as salesman or messenger for relaying his terms to EU leaders and Zelensky.

Andrew Brenneman, a 25-year-old pilot of Frontier Airlines, called in a fake bomb threat to one of his own company's planes to stop his ex-girlfriend from attending a domestic violence court hearing against him. His former girlfriend, also an employee of the same airline, was on the flight from Cincinnati International Airport going to Kentucky.According to reports, Brenneman joined the airline as a First Officer in 2023 and started dating flight attendant Molly Burnam in November 2024. But their relationship ended five months later as Burnam alleged physical abuse against Brenneman and reported a complaint in Kentucky where Brenneman was based. Burnam said Brenneman threw her to the ground, placed his hands around her neck, caused scratches and bruises; and also sent harassing text messages.Based on the report, she was supposed to appear for a court hearing on May 9 for an emergency protective order. a day before, Brenneman called the airline and said there was a bomb threat on the flight Burnam was traveling.The pilot even said that Burnam was planning an attack on the flight.Police removed her immediately and questioned her and allowed her to board another flight to attend the hearing. Burnam informed the police that Brenneman fabricated the threat to block her court appearance.Investigators found there was no credible threat originating from Burnam or otherwise. Frontier later told police that the report originated from Andrew Brenneman,Brenneman’s arrest occurred on July 4 at his home, with charges including domestic violence and harassing communications. Frontier suspended him after the protective order, though his current employment status remains unclear.

‘Floods came like fire’: Pak’s monsoon misery overflows,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/floods-came-like-fire-paks-monsoon-misery-overflows/articleshow/123338698.cms,"A firefighting department vehicle submerged in a floodwater following flash flooding due to heavy rains in the neighbourhood of Mingora, the main town of Swat Valley, northwestern Pakistan, Friday, Aug. 15, 2025. (AP Photo/Sherin Zada)









PESHAWAR: The death toll in north Pakistan’s flash floods and landslides crossed 350 on Saturday, with one resident in worst-hit Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Buner saying the torrents “came like fire”.The devastation, caused by heavy monsoon rains, came without warning. Villagers in Buner said it wasn’t rainwater but a wall of mud and boulders crashing down the mountains. “It felt as if the sky broke apart. We had no chance to run,” said Gul Zarin, a shopkeeper who lost his brother.Buner alone accounted for over 200 fatalities. Dozens were still missing. Neighbouring districts -- Swat, Bajaur, Dir, Shangla, Mansehra, and Kohistan -- were left in ruins as swollen rivers swept away homes, bridges, and police outposts. For many Pakistanis, the scenes recall the 2022 disaster that killed over 1,700 people and submerged a third of the country.Met department warned of more rain till Aug 21 in the region, with cloudbursts and glacial lake outbursts still a danger. Relief operations remain hampered by broken roads and washed-away bridges.Even rescuers were not spared. A govt helicopter ferrying relief supplies to Bajaur crashed in heavy rain, killing all five on board, including two pilots.One had messaged his wife earlier in the day: “Don’t worry, I’ll be back tonight.”For survivors, the destruction is personal. In Pir Baba, a mother sat on the rubble of her home, holding a sodden schoolbag. “This is all I found of my son,” she whispered. The nine-year-old, who dreamed of becoming a teacher, was washed away with hundreds of others.In Shangla, villagers dug with bare hands to retrieve the dead. “We buried them ourselves. “There was no one else to help,” said a teenage boy, his face streaked with dust.The floods are now pushing south. Rising waters in Swabi and Mardan threaten to spill into the Indus plains. Farmers have begun moving cattle and bedding to higher ground. “We can see the river swelling every hour. If it breaks, we will lose everything,” said one farmer.Although the fury reminded many of the 2022 floods, this year’s devastation has been swifter and more violent. Scientists warn that a warming atmosphere is turning each monsoon into a greater threat.The grief, however, is not Pakistan’s alone. The same rivers and monsoon systems bind South Asia. “Maybe people across the border heard this thunder too. It was the sound of our lives breaking,” said a resident of Dir.Beyond statistics, a survivor’s words revealed the raw truth: “We were not warned -- only buried. The state comes too late, the water too fast. Our children’s future is drowning with us.” This monsoon has left Pakistan with a stark reminder: climate reckoning respects no borders.","The death toll in north Pakistan’s flash floods and landslides crossed 350 on Saturday. The devastation, caused by heavy monsoon rains, came without warning. For many Pakistanis, the scenes recall the 2022 disaster that killed over 1,700 people and submerged a third of the country.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123338700,imgsize-320240,width-400,resizemode-4/123338700.jpg"

Rescuers in Pakistan are struggling to recover bodies after flash floods triggered by relentless monsoon rains killed at least 321 people in the past 48 hours, officials told AFP on Saturday. Most casualties were reported in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where 307 people died as rivers burst their banks and houses collapsed.A video shared by RT.com showed the scale of destruction as torrents swept through towns and villages, leaving entire neighbourhoods in ruins. The floods, described by residents as “doomsday”, have left many communities cut off with relief efforts hampered by washed-out roads and ongoing rainfall.Authorities said around 2,000 rescue workers are engaged in operations across nine districts, but access remains severely restricted.“Heavy rainfall, landslides in several areas, and washed-out roads are causing significant challenges in delivering aid, particularly in transporting heavy machinery and ambulances,” Bilal Ahmed Faizi, spokesman for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s rescue agency, told AFP.“Due to road closures in most areas, rescue workers are travelling on foot to conduct operations in remote regions,” he added.Buner district has been hardest hit, recording at least 184 deaths. Other badly affected areas include Shangla, Mansehra, Swat, Bajaur and Battagram. The provincial government has declared these mountainous districts as disaster zones.Survivors have described terrifying scenes as torrents tore through homes without warning.“I heard a loud noise as if the mountain was sliding. I rushed outside and saw the entire area shaking, like it was the end of the world,” Azizullah told AFP. “The ground was trembling due to the force of the water, and it felt like death was staring me in the face.”Mass funerals were held across affected districts on Friday, with mourners grieving in front of rows of bodies covered by blankets. Local schoolteacher Saifullah Khan said: “We still have no clear idea who in this small village is alive and who is dead. I help retrieve the bodies of the children I taught, I keep wondering what kind of trial nature has imposed on these kids.”Officials warned the death toll is likely to rise further as dozens remain missing. Pakistan’s meteorological department has issued more rain alerts, warning that the intensity of the monsoon will worsen over the next two weeks.","Floods triggered by relentless monsoon rains have killed at least 321 people in Pakistan.
