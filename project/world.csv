KOLKATA/BEHRAMPORE: Trinamool Congress national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee Saturday blamed BJP politicians and a ""new gaddar (traitor)"" for stoking violence in Beldanga, a town in Murshidabad district bordering Bangladesh, and urged residents to deny the opposition party political space.""Stop providing oxygen to BJP,"" Banerjee told a public rally in Behrampore.

US Lawmakers Name India As Strategic Partner, Dismiss Pakistan As Ally And Flag China As Top Threat

NEW DELHI: Amid questions over Washington’s outreach to Islamabad in recent months, senior US lawmakers moved to clear the air, stressing that India — not Pakistan — remains central to America’s long-term strategic vision in the Indo-Pacific and beyond.Speaking at a discussion hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), representative Rich McCormick underlined India’s importance to global stability.“There is no more important friend that we’re going to need for the future of not just the United States and India, but for the entire stability of the world, than India,” he said, pointing to “the commonality we have in the way we look at economics and freedom and advancement of a people.”McCormick also highlighted the strength of economic ties between the two countries. “Pakistan is a country with 300 million people. But you don't see it bringing investments into America. India not only take investment, it also brings investments into the United States,” he said.Stressing the broader importance of the relationship, McCormick warned, “If America embraces Indians as friends, we will have peace and prosperity.If we alienate them, it is going to be big trouble for all of us.”His remarks come amid strains in bilateral ties following the Trump administration’s decision to impose steep 50% tariffs over India’s purchase of Russian oil. Relations have also faced friction over issues such as US immigration policy and President Donald Trump’s claim of having ended the India–Pakistan conflict in May last year.Representative Ami Bera echoed the message, saying routine diplomatic engagement with Pakistan should not be mistaken for a strategic shift. “We’re not creating a strategic partnership with Pakistan,” Bera said.“You don’t see American companies making multibillion-dollar investments in Pakistan. That’s all happening in India,” he said, adding that investors clearly understand US priorities.While noting that India follows an independent foreign policy, McCormick said Washington understands New Delhi’s decisions. Calling PM Narendra Modi “extremely nationalistic,” he said, “PM Modi is extremely nationalistic in a good way. He's looking out for his country. When India buys cheap Russian oil, America hates that. But he is doing it in the best interest of his country.”The renewed emphasis on the partnership comes as Washington and New Delhi work to finalise a comprehensive bilateral trade agreement. US Ambassador to India Sergio Gor has said the two sides are actively engaged in concluding a new deal.","US Lawmakers Name India As Strategic Partner, Dismiss Pakistan As Ally And Flag China As Top Threat.

‘BRICS Brings Countries Together’: Jaishankar Frames Bloc as Global Welfare Platform Under India

NEW DELHI: The Indian government has defended its decision to not participate in the ""Brics Naval Exercise"", saying it was purely a South African initiative in which not all Brics members took part.The naval exercise was not a regular or institutionalised Brics activity, said the ministry of external affairs.""India has not participated in previous such activities.

The week-long military wargame took place amid increasing tensions in Iran over possible military strikes on the country following its crackdown on anti-govt protesters.US President Donald Trump has repeatedly attacked Brics for looking to challenge American economic hegemony by moving away from the US dollar. India, however, maintains that it will not back any BRICS push for ""de-dollarisation"".

Pawars meet in Pune



NEW DELHI: Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Saturday dismissed suggestions that deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar had been ""rejected"" on his home turf, saying voters had instead endorsed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership and the BJP’s governance model.“I will not say that people have rejected dada, rather they have accepted the leadership of Prime Minister Modi, the BJP and us,” Fadnavis said, as quoted by PTI.Fadnavis' remarks came a day after the party’s sweeping victory in key civic polls.Ajit Pawar, popularly known as ‘dada’, had allied with his uncle Sharad Pawar’s faction of the NCP for the civic elections in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad, long considered Pawar family strongholds. The alliance, however, failed to stem the BJP’s surge.Also Read: Mumbai BMC Election Results 2026 Live Updates: Shinde Sena moves newly elected corporators to luxury hotel Asked who now held the title of ‘dada’ in Pune politics, Fadnavis replied that authority ultimately rested with the electorate. “The people of Pune are the dada, and we are their sevaks,” he said.Thanking voters for what he described as a “landslide” mandate, Fadnavis said, “I thank the voters of Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad for reposing their faith in the BJP and giving us a landslide victory.I am not merely thanking them; I am indebted to them.” He added that while the results were encouraging, they also carried responsibility. “While we are happy with this mandate, it also reminds us of our responsibility towards these cities. ”The campaign had seen Ajit Pawar attack BJP-led civic administrations over alleged irregularities and stalled development between 2017 and 2022. Fadnavis, however, said the results had settled speculation around the contest, noting that they were “beyond the expectations of many people”.Also Read: BMC and other Maharashtra civic poll results 2026: Top 10 winners and losers He said voters had placed their trust in the BJP’s development vision and PM Modi’s leadership, adding, “We will have to work even harder to live up to the trust that people have placed in us. I will ensure that the vision we presented before the people is translated into reality immediately after the mayor is elected.”Ajit Pawar did not attend a cabinet meeting in Mumbai earlier in the day. Addressing his absence, Fadnavis said, “I had met Ajit Pawar on the voting day (January 15) when he told me that he would not be attending the cabinet meeting.”Pawar on Saturday also met his uncle Sharad Pawar. Ajit Pawar said the meeting was incidental, linked to the inauguration of an agriculture exhibition in Baramati, and stressed family unity amid merger speculation.“An agriculture exhibition was inaugurated today, and I had come to Baramati for that. I was told that (Sharad) Pawar saheb is also at his residence. So I went to his house and we all later headed for the exhibition,” he said.“We are together (as Pawar family). We go to each other’s places at required times,” he added.Congratulating the BJP, he said his party would review the defeat. Pawar dismissed allegations over EVMs and said setbacks should prompt reflection rather than discouragement, adding that alliance decisions for local polls rest with local leadership.“Voters are important, and every political party must continue its efforts. The BJP has achieved significant success, and I congratulate the party for its performance. These civic polls were fought by the BJP under the leadership of Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, and the other parties had to face defeat,” he said.The BJP secured 119 of 165 seats in the Pune civic body, while the Ajit Pawar-led NCP won 27 seats and the NCP (SP) managed just three. In Pimpri Chinchwad, the BJP won 84 of 128 seats, comfortably crossing the majority mark.","Devendra Fadnavis dismisses suggestions that deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar had been ""rejected"" on his home turf.

Cleanliness Crown Cracks As Indore Loses 13 Lives To Poisoned Water And Administrative Lapses

NEW DELHI/INDORE: The Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi , today met the families of the victims who died due to the consumption of contaminated drinking water in Indore and also those who are undergoing treatment in hospital.Gandhi accused the BJP government in Madhya Pradesh of criminal negligence over the deaths and illnesses caused by contaminated drinking water in the Bhagirathpura area of Indore, saying the government must take responsibility and ensure compensation and assistance to the affected families.After meeting the victims and their families, Gandhi said access to clean drinking water remains a serious issue in the country even today. He alleged that the failure to provide safe drinking water and control pollution reflected the government’s inability to discharge its basic responsibilities.Several people have died and many others have fallen ill after consuming contaminated water in the area, he noted, adding that such incidents were a direct consequence of administrative negligence. “The affected families must be given proper compensation and support,” he demanded.Quoting local residents, the Congress leader said there was still no assured supply of clean drinking water in Bhagirathpura, and that alternative arrangements were temporary and largely symbolic. He warned that once public attention faded, the situation could revert to its earlier state. Residents, he said, were demanding a permanent and systematic solution, which was fully justified.Gandhi said that as Leader of the Opposition, it was his duty to raise the concerns of the affected families and stand with them in their struggle for basic civic amenities.He also questioned the implementation of the Smart City scheme, remarking that this appeared to be the new model of a “Smart City” where citizens did not even have access to clean drinking water. The problem, he said, was not limited to Indore but was prevalent in many cities across the country.Later, in a post on X, Gandhi alleged that the BJP’s “double-engine government” model was marked by poisoned water, air, medicine and land, and that when questions were raised, bulldozers were deployed instead of accountability. He said no one was held responsible for the deaths of the poor, and demanded punishment for those responsible, along with proper treatment and immediate compensation for the victims.",Gandhi accused the BJP government in Madhya Pradesh of criminal negligence over the deaths and illnesses caused by contaminated drinking water in the Bhagirathpura area of Indore.

‘BJP Won By Betrayal’: Uddhav Thackeray’s First Reaction On Mumbai Civic Poll Results

NEW DELHI: Following a sweeping victory for the BJP-Shiv Sena Mahayuti in the BMC elections Eknath Shinde shifted the newly elected corporators to a luxury hotel in Bandra on Saturday as the race for Mumbai’s next mayor intensified.The Shiv Sena contested 90 seats in the Mumbai civic polls and won 29. A senior party leader said the corporators were being shifted to the hotel to help them “refresh” after a hectic election season, but did not specify how long they would stay there.Another party functionary said the move was meant to orient newly elected members and added that the corporators would be housed in the hotel for a couple of days.According to sources, the Shinde Sena is likely to stake claim to the Mayor’s post in India’s richest municipal corporation. The demand is being linked to the centenary year of Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray, with January 23 marking his 100th birth anniversary.The undivided Shiv Sena had controlled the BMC for the longest period before the party split into two factions in 2022. In the latest civic polls, the BJP-Shiv Sena alliance emerged as the single largest bloc, defeating the Thackeray brothers. Official figures show the BJP won 89 seats, while its alliance partner, the Shinde Sena, secured 29 seats.After the Mahayuti’s victory in most of the civic bodies that went to polls, the CM said the alliance would form Mayors in 25 of the 29 municipal corporations.However, discussions on the Mayor’s post cannot begin in any of the 29 municipalities until there is clarity on reservations for each municipality’s Mayor position.Earlier today, deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said the decision on the Mayor’s post would be taken collectively by him, deputy CM Eknath Shinde, and party leaders. He clarified, “There is no dispute whatsoever on this.”","The Shiv Sena contested 90 seats in the Mumbai civic polls and won 29.

Navid Afkari’s execution after protests shows the deadly cost of dissent in Iran

Navid Afkari dreamed of wearing Iran’s colors at the Olympics. Donald Trump tried to save his life and Dana White begged publicly for mercy. Still, in September 2020, the Iranian state hanged the 27-year-old wrestler. His death shocked the sports world and sent fear through a nation already hurting.If life had been fair, Afkari would have been training, traveling, and chasing medals. Instead, he was killed by the same country he loved after joining street protests. Iranian officials said he was guilty of murder. Afkari said again and again he was innocent. Human rights groups said his trial was unfair. What happened next showed how dangerous it can be to speak up in Iran.Afkari grew up in Shiraz, a city known for poetry and culture. Wrestling is Iran’s proudest sport, and Afkari was good at it from a young age. By 17, he was in a national camp. By 23, coaches saw him as a future Olympian. To support his training, he worked as a laborer during the day and trained whenever he could. His rise made him famous, and that fame later made him a target.In 2018, Iran faced large protests over rising prices and strict rules.Afkari joined those protests. Soon after, he and his two brothers were arrested and accused of killing a security guard. Afkari said he was tortured into a false confession. Amnesty International called his trial “grossly unfair,” saying he was not allowed a proper defense.Despite global anger, the courts sentenced Afkari to death. One charge was murder. Another was “waging war against the state” for protesting. His brothers received long prison terms, with one spending around 1,000 days in solitary confinement. Afkari’s claims of torture were never properly checked.On September 12, 2020, Afkari was hanged in Shiraz. His family was not allowed a final visit. The execution was rushed. United Nations later said the killing appeared to be used as a warning during growing unrest.Before his death, Afkari recorded a message from prison. He said he had faced many opponents in wrestling, but none as unfair as the system holding him. He said he was innocent and asked people not to forget him.Iran’s power system leaves little room for protest. The Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, has final control. Online spaces are tightly watched, and many platforms are blocked. Journalist Masih Alinejad later said Afkari became a hero after death, not because he wanted fame, but because he spoke up.Trump and White both appealed publicly. Trump posted on Twitter asking Iran to spare Afkari’s life, linking to Fox News. White released a video saying Afkari was a human being and deserved mercy. Their efforts failed.After Afkari’s death, his grave was damaged many times. According to Iran International, officials even tried to control his headstone to stop it becoming a protest site. Years later, fear still surrounds those who speak out. Afkari’s story shows how little has changed, and how high the price of protest remains.Also Read: Olympic Swimmer Ryan Lochte Moves In With Girlfriend And Her Three Kids As Blended Family Grows Amid Divorce And Custody Battle",Iran hanged wrestler Navid Afkari at 27 after protests ignoring pleas from Donald Trump and Dana White.

Indian truck driver Sukhdeep Singh faces deportation after running red light; had licence despite living in US illegally,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/indian-truck-driver-sukhdeep-singh-faces-deportation-after-running-red-light-had-licence-despite-living-in-us-illegally/articleshow/126566595.cms,"



Running a red light has landed Indian truck driver Sukhdeep Singh at risk of deportation from US after authorities found he was in the country illegally.A routine traffic stop in Arizona turned serious when local police pulled over Singh for allegedly running a red light and a stop sign.According to authorities, Singh is an Indian national who was unlawfully present in US. This was confirmed by agents from the Border Patrol after running a brief check, even though Singh had a California commercial driver’s licence.He was taken into custody in the town of Quartzsite and is now being processed for deportation under 8 USC 1182, the section of US immigration law dealing with inadmissible non-citizens.The United States Border Patrol, Yuma Sector, confirmed the incident in a post on X: ""Quartzsite police pulled over Sukhdeep Singh after he ran a red light and a stop sign. Officers contacted Blythe Station Border Patrol agents who determined Singh is an Indian national that was illegally in the United States, despite being in possession of California commercial driver’s license. Singh will be processed for deportation under 8 USC 1182.Border Patrol officials said Singh’s case is not the only one that involves commercial truck drivers without legal immigration status present in US. Earlier operations by agents at the Blythe Station led to the arrest of six undocumented Indian nationals in separate incidents. In each case, the individuals were working as truck drivers and held commercial driving licences despite being in the country unlawfully.It was reported that all six were processed for deportation, and later lost the opportunity to legally re-enter the United States.Authorities also advised the undocumented individuals to voluntarily self-deport using the CBP Home app. This option allows people to leave the country on their own and may help preserve their eligibility to legally return to US in the future.For the last few months, California has been facing federal scrutiny for issuing thousands of commercial driver’s licences to non-citizens, including some without lawful status, in apparent violation of federal rules. The US Department of Transportation has revoked about 17,000 licences, withheld funding and tightened eligibility, saying states must verify immigration status for commercial licences. Most of the truck drivers are from India. The Trump administration blames the Biden-era rules that allegedly allowed thousands of immigrant truck drivers to attain a commercial license without proper english proficiency and formal legal procedures.","Sukhdeep Singh was stopped for running a red light and a stop sign in Arizona.

Thousands killed in unrest: Khamenei blames US; Trump demands new leadership — what's happening in Iran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/thousands-killed-in-unrest-khamenei-blames-us-trump-demands-new-leadership-whats-happening-in-iran/articleshow/126637185.cms,"



For the first time, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has admitted that thousands of people were killed during the country’s recent nationwide protests, a rare acknowledgment from the clerical leadership amid a harsh crackdown that has drawn international attention, Fox News reported.Speaking in a televised address on Saturday, Khamenei said the unrest, which began in late December over economic hardships and wider political grievances, resulted in ""several thousand"" deaths. He described some of the casualties as caused by ""inhuman, savage"" conditions, but pointed the finger at the United States and other foreign actors rather than Iran’s own security forces.Supreme Leader Khamenei also accused US President Donald Trump of encouraging the recent demonstrations in Iran, which began over rising costs and inflation but later turned into broader anti-regime protests. Khamenei called Trump a ""criminal"" for commenting on and supporting the movement from afar.He claimed protesters were being manipulated by foreign powers and warned that authorities would not allow what he termed ""criminals"" to go unpunished, Fox News reported.Human rights organisations have condemned the crackdown, estimating that more than 3,000 people have died in clashes between demonstrators and security forces.Exact figures remain difficult to verify, in part due to intermittent internet shutdowns imposed by Iranian authorities.In response, Trump intensified his rhetoric, saying it was ""time to look for new leadership"" in Iran. In an interview with Politico, he criticised the clerical establishment’s handling of the unrest and condemned Khamenei’s role in the violence, calling him unfit to lead.""What he is guilty of, as the leader of a country, is the complete destruction of the country and the use of violence at levels never seen before,"" Trump said. ""Leadership is about respect, not fear and death.""He added, ""The man is a sick man who should run his country properly and stop killing people. His country is the worst place to live anywhere in the world because of poor leadership.""The exchange comes as global attention focuses on Iran’s political stability and the possibility of further international pressure.Meanwhile, Khamenei continued to accuse the US, posting on X: ""The recent sedition was orchestrated by the US. The US did the planning and took action. The US's goal is to devour Iran.""Despite the tension, daily life in Tehran and other major cities shows signs of returning to normal after weeks of protests and security operations.","Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has admitted that thousands of people were killed during the country’s recent nationwide protests.

'Ripped limb from limb’: January 6 rioter Jake Lang claims he was ‘lynched’ during clash with anti‑ICE protesters in Minneapolis — watch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ripped-limb-from-limb-january-6-rioter-jake-lang-claims-he-was-lynched-during-clash-with-antiice-protesters-in-minneapolis-watch/articleshow/126636550.cms,"Anti-ICE crowd chase off pro-ICE demonstrators from Minneapolis streets (AP photo)





A January 6 rioter pardoned by US President Donald Trump led a small pro-ICE rally in Minneapolis on Saturday, but was quickly swamped by a much larger counter-protest against Trump’s immigration crackdown and the surge of federal agents in the city.Jake Lang, one of around 1,600 people granted clemency by Trump on his first day back in office gathered with his supporters outside the federal courthouse, but was soon surrounded by counter protesters shouting slogans and holding anti-ICE signs. As tensions rose, Lang was chased from the area.Earlier, Lang’s group played the song Ice Ice Baby and made anti-immigrant remarks, claiming immigrants were “replacing” white Americans. Lang had promoted the event online as a “Crusader march” and used the term “Little Somalia” for the area, referring to Minneapolis’ large Somali population. He had also said he planned to burn a Quran during the protest.A local group, the People’s Action Coalition Against Trump, had called for a counter protest, and dozens of people turned up. Videos from the scene showed crowds surrounding Lang and forcing him away from the courthouse.After the rally, Lang claimed on social media that he had been attacked and stabbed. He later said he had been taken to hospital and accused city authorities of failing to protect him. Lang urged Trump to send in the National Guard and shared a fundraising link for his medical bills.""I just got stabbed by a crazie white commie leftist rioter today in Minnesota,"" Lang wrote on X. In another post he said, ""I was just literally lynched by an anti-white mob of liberals & illegal immigrants- I’m at the hospital now getting staples in my skull..Nearly ripped limb from limb in Minneapolis!!!!""The protests came amid rising anger in Minneapolis over a surge of federal immigration agents in the city. Earlier this month, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer fatally shot Renee Good, a 37-year-old woman. The shooting sparked protests across the country.Local and state leaders have openly criticised the federal presence. Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey told ICE to leave the city, while Minnesota officials have sued the Trump administration, arguing that the deployment of agents is unconstitutional.The White House has rejected the criticism and accused Democrats of encouraging violence against law enforcement. Trump has warned he could invoke the Insurrection Act to deploy active-duty troops against protesters, though he later appeared to soften his comments.","Jake Lang was one of around 1,600 people granted clemency by Trump on his first day back in office.

Indonesia plane crash: Wreckage found in Bantimurung-Bulusaraung National Park; search on for 10 onboard,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/indonesia-plane-crash-wreckage-found-in-bantimurung-bulusaraung-national-park-search-on-for-10-onboard/articleshow/126637515.cms,"Indonesia plane crash (AP image)





Rescue teams in Indonesia on Sunday found debris from a small turboprop aircraft that went missing a day earlier in eastern Indonesia. However, the 10 people on board are yet to be located, officials said.The Indonesian Air Transport plane lost contact with air traffic control on Saturday afternoon while flying from Yogyakarta to Makassar, the capital of South Sulawesi province. Authorities launched a large-scale search operation after communication with the aircraft was cut shortly after 1 pm local time.At a press briefing, Muhammad Arif Anwar, head of the Makassar search and rescue agency, said the joint rescue team had recovered aircraft parts believed to include “the fuselage, the tail section, and the windows”. He said both ground and aerial units were continuing efforts to trace the missing passengers and crew, as reported by AFP.“Our current priority is locating victims, and we hope there are still some we can evacuate in a safe condition,” Arif said. He added that an aerial rescue unit had also been deployed to support the search.According to officials, the aircraft crashed into Mount Bulusaraung inside Bantimurung-Bulusaraung National Park, a mountainous area that borders the city of Makassar.The terrain, combined with poor visibility, has made rescue efforts challenging.Local military chief Bangun Nawoko told reporters that the operation was being hindered by harsh terrain and dense fog. “These conditions are slowing movement on the ground and limiting visibility from the air,” he said.More than 1,000 personnel have been involved in the search operation, including teams from the air force, police, search and rescue agencies and local volunteers.Helicopters, drones and ground teams have been deployed across Maros Regency, near the plane’s last known location, officials said. Multiple agencies are coordinating the effort to ensure coverage of difficult-to-reach areas.Authorities said there were 10 people on board the aircraft, including seven crew members and three government employees from the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries. Minister Sakti Wahyu Trenggono said the officials were travelling on official duty.“They were on a mission to conduct aerial monitoring of resources in the area,” Trenggono said, confirming that his ministry was in close contact with rescue agencies and the families of those on board.Aircraft manufacturer ATR said it had been informed of “an accident” involving one of its planes and was supporting the ongoing response. “ATR specialists are fully engaged to support both the investigation led by the Indonesian authorities and the operator,” the company said in a statement.Indonesia, a vast archipelago of more than 17,000 islands, depends heavily on air transport to connect its remote and geographically dispersed regions. However, the country has faced repeated aviation safety challenges over the years, with several fatal accidents involving both planes and helicopters.In September last year, a helicopter carrying six passengers and two crew members crashed shortly after taking off from South Kalimantan province, killing everyone on board. Less than two weeks later, another helicopter crash in the remote Papua district of Ilaga claimed four lives.",Small turboprop aircraft went missing a day earlier in eastern Indonesia.

$1 billion entry fee?

US President Donald Trump wants nations to pay a king’s ransom of $1 billion to remain in harmony with the US and retain a seat on his proposed “peace board”, or as many critics claimed as an ""alternative to the United Nations,"" Bloomberg reported, citing a draft charter.According to the draft, Trump would serve as the inaugural chairman, with each member state granted a term of no more than three years from the charter’s entry into force, subject to renewal at the chairman’s discretion.The draft also says that Trump would decide who is invited as members. Decisions would be made by a majority, with each member state getting one vote, but all decisions would still require the chairman’s approval.“Each Member State shall serve a term of no more than three years from this Charter’s entry into force, subject to renewal by the Chairman. The three-year membership term shall not apply to Member States that contribute more than $1,000,000,000 in cash funds to the Board of Peace within the first year of the Charter’s entry into force,” the draft says.Some critics worry that Trump may be trying to create an alternative to the United Nations, which he has long criticised.The board is described in the draft as “an international organization that seeks to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict.” It would become official once three member states agree to the charter.However, the White House called the report “misleading” and said there is no minimum membership fee to join the Board of Peace.“This simply offers permanent membership to partner countries who demonstrate deep commitment to peace, security, and prosperity,” the White House said on X.The US state department, when asked by Reuters, referred to previous social media posts about the board by Trump and his special envoy Steve Witkoff, which did not mention the $1 billion figure.",US President Donald Trump wants nations to pay a king’s ransom of $1 billion to remain in harmony with the US and retain a seat on his proposed ‘peace board’ Some critics worry that Trump may be trying to create an alternative to the United Nations.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126636766,imgsize-938831,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

‘Escaped Somalia To Be Killed In US?’: Ilhan Omar TRASHES Trump In Fiery ‘ICE Kidnapping’ Hearing





A US federal judge on Friday barred immigration officers in Minnesota from detaining or using force against peaceful protesters.The ruling comes amid rising tensions between federal agents and demonstrators over a large federal immigration enforcement operation in the Minneapolis area, reported AP.In an 83-page order issued on Friday, US District Judge Katherine Menendez restricted how federal immigration agents may interact with protesters, barring them from arresting or detaining individuals engaged in “peaceful and unobstructive protest activity” or from retaliating against protected speech through the use of tear gas, pepper spray, or other crowd-dispersal tools.Judge Menendez ruled that officers may not arrest individuals without probable cause or reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed or that officers are being obstructed. She also barred agents from stopping vehicles when there is no reasonable suspicion, noting that “safely following agents at an appropriate distance does not, by itself, create reasonable suspicion,” AP reported.The ruling grants a preliminary injunction in a lawsuit filed in December on behalf of six Minnesota activists represented by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). The case alleges that federal agents violated protesters’ constitutional rights during immigration enforcement actions.The order gives the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) 72 hours to bring its immigration operation in the Minneapolis–St Paul area into compliance.The order follows a series of violent encounters involving federal agents this month. On January 7, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer fatally shot 37-year-old American woman Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis during a federal immigration enforcement action, officials said the officer fired after Good’s vehicle approached him, though video evidence and local accounts have raised questions about the circumstances of the encounter.Later this week, on January 14, a federal officer shot a Venezuelan man in the leg during a targeted traffic stop in North Minneapolis. DHS said the man, identified as a Venezuelan national, fled and then engaged in a struggle with officers before the shot was fired, and he was hospitalised and is expected to recover.In a separate incident, DHS confirmed that Heber Sanchez Dominguez, a 34-year-old Mexican national, died while in ICE custody, bringing the number of deaths in ICE detention so far this year to at least four.The Justice Department is investigating Walz and Frey for allegedly impeding federal officers, CBS News reported, a move that could further inflame tensions. The department did not respond to requests for comment. Responding to the ruling, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the agency was taking “appropriate and constitutional measures to uphold the rule of law and protect our officers and the public from dangerous rioters,” AP reported, adding that obstructing or assaulting law enforcement remained a serious crime.Protests intensified after Good’s killing, with crowds clashing with immigration officers and counter-protesters. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz accused federal agents of carrying out “a campaign of organised brutality against the people of Minnesota,” in a video posted on X, AFP said. Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey have called for peaceful protests against immigration sweeps.US President Donald Trump, who earlier threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act to deploy the military, said on Friday that there was no immediate need to do so. “If I needed it, I would use it. I don’t think there is any reason right now to use it,” he told reporters at the White House, according to AFP.BBC notes that the Insurrection Act, a 19th-century law, allows a US president to deploy active-duty military forces to carry out law-enforcement duties within the United States. Presidents may invoke the statute if they determine that “unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion” make it impracticable to enforce federal law through ordinary judicial proceedings.Once invoked, the law permits troops, including the National Guard, which is typically used for domestic emergencies and disaster response — to perform a wide range of functions, from quelling civil unrest and enforcing court orders to arresting and detaining migrants.","A US federal judge on Friday barred immigration officers in Minnesota from detaining or using force against peaceful protesters.

Trump's Brutal ISIS Revenge: US Military Air-drops 90 Bombs On Arab Nation After Venezuela





US forces have killed a senior Al-Qaeda-affiliated operative in northwest Syria during a retaliatory strike linked to last month’s ambush that claimed the lives of two American soldiers and a civilian interpreter, US officials said.The strike, confirmed by US Central Command on Friday, targeted Bilal Hasan al-Jasim, whom officials described as “an experienced terrorist leader who plotted attacks and was directly connected” to the December 13 assault. The ambush killed Sergeant Edgar Brian Torres-Tovar, Sgt. William Nathaniel Howard and interpreter Ayad Mansoor Sakat.CENTCOM commander Admiral Brad Cooper said the operation underscored Washington’s determination to pursue those responsible for attacks on US personnel. “The death of a terrorist operative linked to the deaths of three Americans demonstrates our resolve in pursuing terrorists who attack our forces,” he said. “There is no safe place for those who conduct, plot, or inspire attacks on American citizens and our warfighters. We will find you.”The strike marked the third wave of US retaliation ordered by American President Donald Trump following the attack, forming part of a wider campaign aimed at “ISIS thugs” attempting to reorganise after the fall of former Syrian leader Bashar Assad a year ago.The Republican president has said Syrian forces were fighting alongside US troops as cooperation expands under the anti-ISIS coalition, and noted that Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa was “extremely angry and disturbed by this attack.""According to CENTCOM, the ongoing operation, codenamed “Hawkeye Strike,” has seen the US and allied forces, including Jordan and Syria, hit more than 100 Islamic State infrastructure and weapons targets.","US forces have killed a senior Al-Qaeda-affiliated operative in northwest Syria during a retaliatory strike linked to last month’s ambush that claimed the lives of two American soldiers and a civilian interpreter.

Greenland Explodes, Protesters Storm US Embassy As Trump Vows Takeover By June 1 | ‘Hands Off!’

Trump announces tariffs

Why Trump wants Greenland

Rising international tensions





Thousands of Greenlanders marched through snow- and ice-covered streets on Saturday in what is being described as the largest coordinated protests the Arctic island has seen. The mass rally was aimed at rejecting renewed pressure from US President Donald Trump to take control of the territory and voicing support for Greenland’s self-rule.In Nuuk, the capital, demonstrators waved their national flag, carried hand-painted signs reading “Greenland is not for sale” and chanted in Greenlandic as they walked from the city center to the US Consulate, which was sealed off by police. According to police and organizers, the march drew nearly a quarter of Nuuk’s population, making it unprecedented for a city of fewer than 20,000 people. Similar protests and solidarity rallies were held in other Greenlandic towns, as well as in Copenhagen and other Danish cities, news agency AP reported.Greenland prime minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen joined the march in Nuuk, at one point climbing onto a snowbank to raise a flag as the crowd cheered. “We said it last year, and we will keep saying it: We are not for sale,” Isak Berthelsen, a 43-year-old electrician was quoted by the New York Times as saying, adding that repeating the message was “energizing” because it showed Greenlanders had “our own voice.”Many protesters said they had reached a breaking point after repeated statements by Trump suggesting the United States would take Greenland “one way or the other.”“Every new statement makes it worse,” said Kristian Johansen, a retired carpenter who helped organize the demonstration. ""I hope it can show him that we stand together in Europe,’ Nuuk police officer Tom Olsen was quoted by AP as saying. 'We are not going down without a fight. ""As the protest in Nuuk concluded, news broke that Trump had announced a 10% import tax, starting in February, on goods from Denmark and several other European countries that oppose US control of Greenland. “I thought this day couldn’t get any worse but it just did,” said Malik Dollerup-Scheibel, a 21-year-old protester, after learning of the announcement, news agency AP reported.Despite concerns about the economic impact of tariffs, several demonstrators said Greenland’s autonomy mattered more. “This is a fight for freedom,” said former Greenland lawmaker Tillie Martinussen.Also read: Trump's Greenland push- Atlantic alliance cracks over Arctic US President Donald Trump has repeatedly argued that the United States needs to acquire Greenland for national security reasons, citing growing global competition in the Arctic. The White House reiterated this position last week, even as protests spread across Greenland and Denmark.“The President has made his priority quite clear. He wants the United States to acquire Greenland. He thinks it is in our best national security to do that,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a media briefing. She added that the deployment of European Nato troops to Greenland would not affect Trump’s plans, saying it did not “impact his goal of the acquisition of Greenland at all.”Trump has warned that if the United States does not take control of Greenland, rival powers would. He has said that “China or Russia will” otherwise gain influence over the strategically located Arctic island, comments that have heightened tensions within Nato and alarmed many Greenlanders.The renewed push has come alongside increased military activity in the Arctic. European Nato countries, including France, Germany, Sweden and Norway, have announced troop deployments to Greenland as part of Danish-led security exercises. Germany’s defense ministry said the mission was intended to examine ways to ensure Arctic security in response to what it described as “Russian and Chinese threats,” while France confirmed its first personnel were already en route, news agency AFP reported.The protests followed a week of heightened diplomatic and military activity. France, Germany, Sweden and Norway have announced the deployment of military personnel to Greenland as part of Danish-led exercises, a move Danish officials say is aimed at strengthening Arctic security. Denmark’s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said a working group would be set up on security issues but stressed that “the American ambition to take over Greenland remains intact,” calling the situation “a serious matter. ”Greenland’s deputy prime minister, Mute Egede, said Nato forces would have a greater presence in coming days, while Russia has criticized the deployments. For many protesters, however, the message remained simple. “We are not American, and we will never be American,” said Maria Meier Brun at a rally in Copenhagen.","Thousands of Greenlanders march through snow- and ice-covered streets on Saturday.

In both ‘Embers of War’ and ‘

JFK

: Coming of Age in the American Century’, you emphasise the concept of “contingency” — the idea that critical junctures presented real choices for leaders. Comparing the early 1960s to the post-9/11 period, do you see a similar failure of American political culture to genuinely debate alternative paths, or were the structural pressures in each era fundamentally different?

Your biography of JFK details his evolution on Vietnam. Given the evidence of his private scepticism, if he had lived and won re-election in 1964, would a full-scale Americanisation of the war have been avoidable?

Your work shows JFK as a complex figure — both a committed Cold Warrior and a pragmatic internationalist who sought engagement with the non-aligned movement. In today’s era of renewed great-power competition, which aspect of his worldview do you find relevant or instructive?

In ‘Embers of War’, you establish the deep roots of the Vietnam conflict in the colonial period. When US policymakers later spoke of “learning from the French mistake”, what was the fundamental lesson they refused to learn?

How does focusing on a figure like JFK change your view of the

Cold War

? Can the Great Man Theory, which suggests that history is basically shaped by the actions of extraordinary men, and structuralist history coexist?

As a historian, you have done a lot to bridge the distance between academia and the public square. As you look at current global crises, what is the most urgent lesson from the early Cold War and Vietnam for today’s policymakers?





Harvard professor Fredrik Logevall is best known for his Pulitzer Prize-winning book, ‘Embers of War’, which is a powerful account of the French conflict in Vietnam and the lessons America failed to learn from it. He is currently executive-producing the Netflix adaptation of his biography of John F Kennedy, starring Michael Fassbender as Joe Kennedy Sr.In this interview with Tina Shashikanth on the sidelines of the Jaipur Literature Festival, Logevall speaks about why history’s most enduring lesson may be humilityThere are differences and similarities. After 9/11, the threat felt immediate and acute to all Americans. In the early 1960s, Vietnam was a slow build-up that most ignored. The key similarity is how leaders in both eras boxed themselves in. By repeatedly declaring publicly that victory in Vietnam or Afghanistan was essential to American security, they made it politically excruciating to later change course. This points to how perceived domestic political imperatives, perhaps especially potent in a geographically powerful and secure nation like the US, can drive foreign policy.We can’t know for sure, but his doubts about a military solution were deeper than Lyndon Johnson’s. Crucially, Kennedy’s key decision would have come in his second term, liberating him from re-election politics. He was also more secure, actively encouraging dissenting voices in his administration, unlike Johnson, who demanded consensus. The change in leadership mattered.His internationalism and understanding of limits. He grasped that American power, however great, is finite. In the fall of 1961, in his first year as president, he said America cannot solve every world problem. While opposed to Soviet communism, he was deeply interested in arms control and preventing nuclear war. His inaugural address was, in my view, less aggressive and belligerent than often remembered. This sensibility — recognising the need to engage the world, not dominate it — is critical.They refused to learn that they were repeating French mistakes. Studying both the French and the American wars produces déjà vu: the problems of counterinsurgency, telling friend from foe, insufficient troops, and an apathetic or hostile local population were identical. However, Americans believed they were different because they were not colonialists but ‘liberators’, and more powerful. They failed to see that for most Vietnamese, both were large western powers imposing their will at gunpoint.Biography forces you to confront structure versus agency. There is this idea that the history of the world is, at least in part, the history of decisions made by powerful people. I believe both structure and agency matter. Leaders, especially American presidents during the Cold War, possessed significant agency — their decisions shaped history. Even today, Donald Trump can affect so much of what happens in the world. So, in a way, it’s a kind of affirmation of the so-called Great Man Theory of history. Yet, they also faced immense constraints, both internationally and domestically. It is a constant question for me as a biographer — what’s the role of individual agency versus the role played by the deep state? Sometimes people ask me, ‘Is biography different from history?’ The research is similar to general history, but biography keeps the individual constantly at the centre. If the subject disappears from the narrative for too long, the reader asks for them to be reintroduced.The most urgent thing that my reading of modern history teaches is the critical importance of considering unintended consequences. Leaders as well as ordinary people often fail to anticipate how things can go wrong. Related to this is the necessity for empathy — the capacity to see the world through others’ eyes, which I fear we are losing. Finally, a historical sensibility brings humility — about the limits of power, the importance of working with allies and even adversaries, and what can be achieved when we understand our constraints. It’s both a cautionary and a hopeful message.","Harvard professor Fredrik Logevall is best known for his Pulitzer Prize-winning book, ‘Embers of War’ He is currently executive-producing the Netflix adaptation of his biography of John F Kennedy, starring Michael Fassbender as Joe Kennedy Sr. In this interview with Tina Shashikanth on the sidelines of the Jaipur Literature Festival, he speaks about why history's most enduring lesson may be humility.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126614548,imgsize-21920,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-1.jpg"

US President Donald Trump on Saturday called for an end to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s 37-year reign, saying, “It’s time to look for new leadership in Iran,” in comments to POLITICO.Trump made the remarks as widespread protests calling for an end to the regime appeared to have waned, after thousands of protesters across the country were killed over the last three weeks. The killings prompted Trump to repeatedly threaten military intervention.On Tuesday, Trump called on Iranians to keep protesting and “take over institutions,” saying that “help is on its way.” The next day, the president abruptly changed course, saying he had been informed that the killings had stopped.“The best decision he ever made was not hanging more than 800 people two days ago,” Trump said Saturday, when asked about the size of a possible US military operation in Iran.Trump’s comments came shortly after Khamenei’s X account posted a series of hostile messages aimed at Trump, accusing the US president of being responsible for deadly violence and unrest in Iran.“We find the US President guilty due to the casualties, damages and slander he inflicted upon the Iranian nation,” Khamenei wrote.In another post, he said Trump had mischaracterised violent groups as representing the Iranian people, calling it “an appalling slander.”Trump, after being read the posts, said Tehran’s rulers rely on repression and violence to govern. “What he is guilty of, as the leader of a country, is the complete destruction of the country and the use of violence at levels never seen before,” Trump said. “In order to keep the country functioning — even though that function is a very low level — the leadership should focus on running his country properly, like I do with the United States, and not killing people by the thousands in order to keep control. ”“Leadership is about respect, not fear and death,” Trump added.The exchange underscored a sharpening rhetoric between Washington and Tehran at a volatile moment for the region, and as Khamenei recently made a public address in which he claimed that “the Iranian nation has defeated America.”Trump went further in personal terms, denouncing Khamenei and the Iranian system of governance.“The man is a sick man who should run his country properly and stop killing people,” Trump said. “His country is the worst place to live anywhere in the world because of poor leadership.”",US President Donald Trump called for an end to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s 37-year reign.

Who is on the Gaza executive board





Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has publicly criticised the US administration over the composition of a newly announced Gaza governing body, marking a rare open disagreement with President Donald Trump’s White House.In a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office, Netanyahu said the announcement on the “Gaza Executive Board” was made without coordination with Israel and runs counter to Israeli policy.As per the Times of Israel, the statement said that “the announcement regarding the composition of the Gaza Executive Board, which is subordinate to the Board of Peace, was not coordinated with Israel and contradicts its policy”.The White House had earlier named both an “Executive Board” and a separate “Gaza Executive Board” as part of its Gaza ceasefire and governance plan.The inclusion of figures such as Turkish foreign minister Hakan Fidan in the Gaza Executive Board is believed to be one of the main reasons behind Netanyahu’s decision to issue the statement.Turkey has strained relations with Israel, despite maintaining contacts with Hamas.The Prime Minister’s Office said Netanyahu has instructed foreign minister Gideon Sa’ar to raise Israel’s concerns directly with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.This is notable as Sa’ar has largely been kept away from handling Israel-US relations in recent months, which have instead been managed through Netanyahu’s office and his close advisers.The US administration has said the Gaza governance plan will be overseen by a “Board of Peace” led by President Trump, with an executive committee of international figures supervising the process.The executive committee includes US secretary of state and national security adviser Marco Rubio, White House Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, former British prime minister Tony Blair, World Bank president Ajay Banga and Apollo Global Management chief Marc Rowan.Regional representatives named include Turkish foreign minister Hakan Fidan, Qatari diplomat Ali Al-Thawadi, Egypt’s intelligence chief Gen Hassan Rashad, and UAE Cabinet minister Reem Al-Hashimy.Other members include Maj Gen Jasper Jeffers, appointed to lead an international stabilisation force, former UN Middle East envoy Nickolay Mladenov as high representative for Gaza, UN humanitarian coordinator Sigrid Kaag, and Israeli businessman Yakir Gabay, who provides Israel with an unofficial presence on the board, according to news agency AP.Ali Shaath has been named head of the new Palestinian committee to run Gaza’s daily affairs.The White House says the plan has entered its second phase, which includes international security deployment, disarmament of Hamas and reconstruction of Gaza.Netanyahu’s statement, however, signals Israeli discomfort with key elements of the plan being advanced without prior coordination with Jerusalem.",Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu has publicly criticised the US administration over the composition of a newly announced Gaza governing body.

Amid the ongoing ICE crackdown in Minnesota, primarily targeting Somali migrants, a video of two students being detained by the ICE went viral, claiming that they are Indian students. Several NRI groups circulated the video with a warning message asking Indian students to stay away from part-time restaurant jobs, as the visa does not permit this and they can be arrested for breaking the law.Going by the viral claim, the incident took place at an Indian restaurant at St. Louis Park, Minnesota. There has been no official confirmation about the raid at an Indian restaurant or the arrest of two Indian students working there who were believed to be released later after questioning, but the ICE crackdown is going on in St Louis Park.ICE agents are storming establishments in the area, including day cares, elementary schools, as photos and videos of their confrontation with the locals, who allege that their daily life is being disrupted because of the heavy presence of the ICE agents, go viral. Democrats have condemned the intense trauma and terror caused by the enforcement surge in Minnesota.Minnesota has been targeted because of the alleged welfare fraud linked to Somali migrants.But the ICE agents are raiding any establishment, picking up anyone obstructing their work, and questioning people about their citizenship.The crackdown goes on even after the shooting of Minneapolis woman Renee Good, a US citizen, triggered a major controversy and the ICE agent Jonathan Ross is still in hiding because of public outrage. The administration defended Ross and said he fired at the woman because the woman was coming at him with her car.As NRI channels are openly alerting students not to engage in part-time employment at restaurants, it came to the surface how Indian students are openly breaking visa rules as F-1 visa in the US does not allow students to work outside the campus. They are allowed on-campus jobs only up to 20 hours per week during semesters. But many local Indian restaurants employ them without any legal basis with a cash-in-hand arrangement which is a serious violation of the visa status that may qualify for loss of F-1 status, visa cancellation and future visa problems in the US.","Video of two students being detained by the ICE went viral, claiming that they are Indian students.

In the 12 days since the US seized Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, interim President Delcy Rodriguez worked to consolidate her power by installing loyalists in key positions to protect herself from internal threats, and one of them is interior minister Diosdado Cabello.A new Reuters report revealed a lot about Diosdado Cabello and his connection with the US authorities and also about Rodriguez, who is very firm to secure her position.Rodriguez, 56, a quiet but rigorous technocrat who was vice president and oil minister, named a central banker to help run the economy, a presidential chief of staff and a new head of Venezuela’s feared DGCIM, the military counterintelligence agency built over decades with Cuban assistance.Major General Gustavo Gonzalez, 65, will now head the agency, a move three sources with knowledge of the govt described as an early gambit by Rodriguez to counter what many in Venezuela said was the biggest threat to her leadership: Diosdado Cabello, Venezuela's hardline interior minister with close ties to the security services and the dreaded “colectivos” motorcycle gangs which have killed opposition supporters.""She is very clear that she doesn't have the capacity to survive without the consent of the Americans,"" said one source close to the govt. ""She's already reforming the armed forces, removing people and naming new officials.""Interviews with seven sources in Venezuela, including diplomats, business people and politicians, revealed in previously unreported detail the fault line at the heart of Venezuela's govt and the risks it posed to Rodriguez as she tried to consolidate internal control while meeting Trump administration dictates on oil sales. The sources spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.The tightrope Rodriguez was attempting to walk was evident in her first major speech since taking office. Addressing parliament in a national annual address on Thursday, she called for unity, stressed her bona fides as Maduro’s loyal deputy, and vowed to forge a new chapter in Venezuela’s politics with increased oil investment.Venezuela’s communications ministry, which handles all press inquiries for the govt and individual officials, did not respond to a request for comment for this story.The White House responded to emailed questions from Reuters by referring the news agency to recent comments made by Trump. In an interview with Reuters on Wednesday, Trump said Rodriguez ""has been very good to deal with"" and that he expected her to visit Washington at some point.Rodriguez, nicknamed ""the tsarina"" for her business connections, had broad influence over the country's civilian levers of power, including the crucial oil industry, and now also enjoyed the backing of the United States. That backing appeared to be reemphasised on Thursday when Rodriguez met with CIA director John Ratcliffe in Caracas.The other main faction was led by Cabello. Cabello, who also heads the ruling PSUV socialist party, is a former soldier with a weekly four-hour show on state television, which has run for 12 years. His first public act after Maduro's capture was to appear on screen dressed in a flak jacket and surrounded by armed guards as he led a chant of, ""To doubt is to betray.”Officials in the Trump administration had contact with Cabello months before the operation to seize Maduro and have also been in communication with him since, four sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, warning him against using the security services or colectivos to target the opposition.Cabello, who was jailed in Venezuela for backing eventual socialist President Hugo Chavez in a failed 1992 coup, is under indictment in the US and has a $25 million reward for his capture.So far Cabello has been conciliatory towards Rodriguez, saying they are “very united” and he arrived at Thursday's national address alongside Rodriguez and her brother Jorge, the head of the national assembly. But sources with knowledge of their relationship told Reuters that Cabello remained the biggest threat to her ability to govern.In Caracas, security forces were skittish. A few hours after Rodriguez was sworn in, there was a brief burst of anti-aircraft fire outside the presidential palace that some feared could be another US attack. Instead, reports suggested it was a miscommunication between police and the presidential guard, which shot down police drones. The govt said the craft were spy drones, without explaining who they belonged to.Across the country, people were reeling from the shock of Maduro’s capture and unsure whether to be hopeful or scared. In some places, local socialist party branches asked members to spy on their neighbours and report anyone celebrating Maduro’s downfall, according to three party members who spoke on condition of anonymity.In this tense environment, Rodriguez had to persuade party loyalists that she was not a US puppet who betrayed Maduro. She also had to stabilise an economy that saw prices for basic goods soar in the days since the US attack, as well as wrestle some degree of control over the sprawling military-linked patronage networks that developed over decades of Chavismo rule.Venezuela has as many as 2,000 generals and admirals, more than double the number in the United States, a military superpower with 20 times more active duty and reserve troops. Senior and retired officers control food distribution, raw materials and the state oil company PDVSA, while dozens of generals sit on the boards of private firms.Many officials were able to run their regional fiefdoms as they saw fit, ordering patrols or checkpoints by soldiers under their command, and some parts of the country and the capital Caracas saw increased activity by security services since Maduro's capture.Gonzalez, the new head of the military counterintelligence agency DGCIM, worked closely with Cabello over his long career in Venezuela’s govt, particularly during two stints as head of the separate civilian spy agency.Yet it was to Rodriguez that Gonzalez owed his most recent posts. In 2024, Rodriguez tapped Gonzalez for a top job at the state oil company, Venezuela’s most important company and the engine of the country’s economy.Questions still remained over how much control Gonzalez would be able to exert over DGCIM. Cabello's allies within the agency could undermine him, the three sources with knowledge of the govt said.One source with knowledge of the inner workings of the security services said Gonzalez's DGCIM predecessor General Javier Marcano struggled to control the agency.""The role of boss of repression already has a name… Diosdado,"" this person said. ""Marcano was coordinating with (civilian) militias and with the colectivos, but he had serious difficulties controlling DGCIM because his designation was nominal.""Reuters could not reach Marcano directly and all formal communication with officials in Venezuela is handled through the communications ministry, which did not respond to a list of questions related to this story.The colectivos, closely connected to Cabello, could also make the country ungovernable by implementing a so-called ""anarchization"" strategy, which was first designed to fend off US intervention but could be directed against Rodriguez, the source close to the govt told Reuters. That strategy would mobilise the intelligence services and colectivos to plunge Caracas into disorder and chaos.Cabello could also slow the pace of prisoner releases that have been hailed by Trump. They have been proceeding much more slowly than demanded by families and rights groups, creating a potential pressure point for Rodriguez.Outside of Venezuela, however, pressure on Cabello continued to mount.""For the Trump administration to achieve a real transition in Venezuela, sooner or later Diosdado Cabello must face U.S. justice,"" US Representative Maria Elvira Salazar said on X this month. ""When Diosdado is brought to justice, it will be a decisive step toward a democratic transition in Venezuela and the release of all political hostages.""",Interim President Delcy Rodriguez has installed loyalists in key positions to protect herself from internal threats. Interior minister Diosdado Cabello is seen as the biggest threat to her leadership.

"New York heist: Gunmen take 'gotta catch ’em all' too seriously; Pokémon cards worth $100,000 stolen",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-york-heist-gunmen-take-gotta-catch-em-all-too-seriously-pokmon-cards-worth-100000-stolen/articleshow/126620441.cms,"Representative image





“Gotta catch ’em all” is meant to be a childhood slogan about collecting fantasy creatures, not a real-world crime spree. But in a brazen robbery that stunned New York’s trading card community, armed men appeared to take the Pokémon mantra far too literally, storming a Manhattan card shop and making off with rare collectables worth over $100,000.The robbery took place around 6:45 pm (local time) on Wednesday at Poké Court, a newly opened store on West 13th Street, an area better known for luxury boutiques and exclusive clubs.Three men entered the shop, and one of them immediately pulled out a gun and pointed it at customers and staff, store owner Courtney Chin was quoted as saying by the New York Times.Another suspect pulled a curtain across the front of the store and stood guard to stop anyone from leaving.Security footage shows two of the men smashing a locked display case with a hammer and grabbing high-value Pokémon cards and sealed packs before stuffing them into backpacks.Chin said the store keeps its most valuable items in the case, including rare and professionally authenticated cards.“They started systemically taking the items that had really large price tags, really high values,” Chin said, adding that the stolen items included a first-edition Charizard card worth about $15,000, as per the New York Times.Products inside the case were priced between $400 and $18,000, according to Peter Du, the store’s partnerships manager.The men, dressed in black, also took an unknown amount of cash from the register and stole a phone from a 27-year-old woman, police said.The entire incident lasted about three minutes, and no one was injured. No arrests have been made so far, and the investigation is ongoing, according to the New York Police Department, reported NBC News.The robbery occurred during Poké Court’s first community event since opening in November. Around 50 people were inside the store for a free arts-and-crafts workshop focused on customising Pokémon card display cases.Chin said she was shocked the shop was targeted on the night of the event. “It’s a beautiful place. It’s a community space, and we obviously want to keep it safe and bright and cozy and welcoming,” she said.A heightened police presence was seen outside the store the following day, with broken glass still visible on the smashed display case. Supporters of the store sent snacks and supplies, a gesture that content creator Keem Kim described as reflecting the spirit of the Pokémon community, as per the New York Times.The Manhattan robbery is the latest in a growing string of Pokémon card thefts across the United States. At least $300,000 worth of Pokémon cards were stolen from a California shop earlier this month, while a Massachusetts store lost more than $100,000 worth of rare cards in July, according to the New York Times.NBC News also reported recent incidents in Los Angeles, including a burglary in Burbank involving around $100,000 in merchandise and a separate robbery where a customer’s Pokémon collection valued at roughly $300,000 was stolen.Experts say the surge in thefts reflects the rising value of trading cards. Corey Williams, an assistant professor of economics at Shippensburg University, said, as quoted by the New York Times, that the pandemic fuelled renewed interest in Pokémon, with some collectors treating rare cards as low-cost investments.The weaponisation of monetary value, he noted, has made such items increasingly attractive targets for criminals.Store managers say many card shops are now rethinking security, including limiting displays of high-value cards or moving to appointment-only visits, as the risk of theft continues to grow.As investigators sift through security footage and hunt for leads, the slogan seems to have taken on a new, unintended meaning. This time, it’s not collectors but the police who are under pressure to “catch them all” — and bring the stolen Pokémon cards back where they belong.","The robbery took place around 6:45 pm (local time) on Wednesday at Poké Court, a newly opened store on West 13th Street.

Indian-origin doctor arrested in Ohio after 10-week-old infant son found with broken bones: 'Don't know how this happened',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/indian-origin-doctor-arrested-in-ohio-after-10-week-old-infant-son-found-with-broken-bones-dont-know-how-this-happened/articleshow/126620442.cms,"Dr Gowda shows how he changed baby's diaper; cops arrest him





Dr Hanuman Gowda, a 31-year-old Indian-origin physician working at ProMedica Hospital, has been arrested and charged after his 10-week-old son was found with multiple broken bones. Dr Gowda said he did not know how this happened, as there was no physical or verbal abuse at home. Days later, he told the police that the infant might have fallen off the bed, or off the bounce chair but investigators told him that the injuries were not consistent with what he was describing. Then Dr Gowda showed how he changed his son's diapers and police arrested him as they alleged that being a physician Dr Gowda was aware that his hand placement on a baby's chest would have caused great pain.Dr Gowday has been charged with two counts of second-degree felonious assault, two counts of second-degree endangering children, and two counts of third-degree endangering children.On January 4, the baby was brought to the Toledo Hospital after Dr Gowda reported that the baby appeared to be in pain. A medical examination revealed that teh baby had at least ten different bone fractures throughout his body. The hospital informed the police and reported ""possible non-accidental trauma"" to the baby.Dr Gowda described to the police how he would put his hand on the baby's chest to hold him down while changing his diaper. According to the affidavit he said “he has done this hard enough that he knows he is causing pain” to the infant.He also told police he would grab the baby’s arms and hold them down on the side “with force” and “he knows he has caused pain” to the infant because the child was crying.The incident was separate from Dr Gowda's work at the hospital and he was put on administrative leave. “We will work with and support the involved authorities as appropriate. The safety and care of our patients and their families remain our top priority,” the hospital said.","Dr Hanuman Gowda, a 31-year-old Indian-origin physician, has been arrested and charged after his 10-week-old son was found with multiple broken bones.

Pakistan Calls Indian Army Chief's Terror Camp Remark Delusional Rhetoric, Terror Bosses Blow Cover





At least 23 people were killed in two separate road accidents in Pakistan on Saturday, including six children, as dense fog and over-speeding continued to disrupt traffic across several regions, according to officials.In the first incident, 14 people, including six children and five women, lost their lives when a truck carrying passengers fell from a bridge into a dry canal in Punjab’s Sargodha district.According to news agency PTI, the accident occurred in Kot Momin tehsil, around 200 kilometres from Lahore, during the early hours of the day.A spokesperson for Punjab Emergency Services Rescue 1122 said the truck had 23 people on board, most of them members of an extended family travelling from Islamabad to Faisalabad to attend a funeral.“As the motorway was closed because of heavy fog, the truck took a local route. It fell from the Galapur bridge in Kot Momin tehsil into a dry canal as the driver lost control over the vehicle because of poor visibility,” the spokesperson said.Nine people were injured in the crash and are being treated at the Civil Hospital in Kot Momin, according to PTI.In a separate incident in Balochistan, at least nine people were killed and 15 others injured when a passenger coach overturned on the Makran Coastal Highway near Gwadar early Saturday.Coastal Highway Police Superintendent of Police Aslam Bangulzai confirmed the accident, saying the coach was travelling from Jiwani to Karachi. “The accident took place early this morning on the Makran coastal highway as the passenger coach overturned due to over speeding,” Bangulzai said, as quoted by PTI.Dense fog has severely affected traffic movement across Punjab’s motorways and major roads during night and early morning hours since the onset of an extreme cold wave last month.As reported by Dawn, several motorway sections have been closed intermittently due to low visibility.Pakistan frequently witnesses fatal road accidents, with factors such as over-speeding, poor enforcement of traffic rules, driver fatigue and weak licensing controls cited as major causes.On December 31, at least 14 passengers were killed in a head-on collision between a bus and a van on the Jhang-Faisalabad road in Punjab, according to PTI.","At least 23 people were killed in two separate road accidents in Pakistan on Saturday.

Pact To Power Bloc: How Turkish Arms, Saudi Money And Pakistan Nukes May Align In Islamic NATO





Islamic Nato in the making? Turkey is seeking to join a defence alliance between nuclear-armed Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, this can be seen as an effort in direction to reshape security alignments in the Middle East region and beyond, as Bloomberg reported.The pact, initially signed by Pakistan and Saudi Arabia in September, reportedly states that “any aggression” against one member would be treated as an attack on all -- a provision that mirrors Article 5 of Nato, of which Turkey is a member and fields the second-largest military after the US.Talks on Turkey’s entry are said to be at an advanced stage, with a deal appearing likely, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg on condition of anonymity.Bloomberg reported that the expanded alliance reflects growing overlap in the strategic interests of Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan across South Asia, the Middle East and parts of Africa.Turkey also sees the arrangement as a way to strengthen its security and deterrence posture at a time when questions persist over US reliability and President Donald Trump’s commitment to Nato, despite Washington’s close military ties with all three countries.Saudi Arabia would bring financial strength to the grouping, Pakistan its nuclear capability, ballistic missiles and manpower, while Turkey contributes military experience and a rapidly expanding defence industry, said Nihat Ali Ozcan, a strategist with Ankara-based think tank TEPAV.“As the US prioritizes its own interests and that of Israel in the region, changing dynamics and fallout from regional conflicts are prompting countries to develop new mechanisms to identify friends and foes,” Ozcan said.Turkish defence ministry declined to comment on the report. Pakistan’s information ministry did not respond to requests for comment, while Saudi officials were unavailable over the weekend.If Turkey formally joins the pact, it would highlight a new phase in relations with Saudi Arabia, once rivals for leadership of the Sunni Muslim world. After years of strained ties, the two countries are now deepening economic and defence cooperation, including holding their first-ever naval meeting in Ankara this week, according to the Turkish defence ministry.Despite shared concerns over Shiite-majority Iran, Turkey and Saudi Arabia favour engagement with Tehran rather than confrontation. They also back a stable, Sunni-led Syria and support Palestinian statehood.Turkey and Pakistan already enjoy close military ties. Ankara is building corvette warships for Pakistan’s navy, has upgraded Islamabad’s F-16 fighter jets, and shares drone technology with both Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. Bloomberg previously reported that Turkey now wants both countries to join its Kaan fifth-generation fighter jet programme.The trilateral defence discussions come after a ceasefire between India and Pakistan ended a four-day military clash and high tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May. Regional tensions remain high, however, with Pakistan and Afghanistan at odds following clashes and accusations by Islamabad that the Taliban is sheltering hostile militant groups.Turkey and Qatar have mediated talks between the sides, though those efforts have so far failed to produce a breakthrough, Bloomberg reported.","Turkey is seeking to join a defence alliance between nuclear-armed Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.

Open Letter From Pakistan Backs India As Baloch Leader Signals Diplomatic Break With Islamabad





A fresh surge of enforced disappearances has been reported across Balochistan, Karachi, and adjoining regions, with nine more Baloch citizens allegedly taken away by Pakistsecurity agencies in recent weeks.Human rights defenders stated that these incidents follow a familiar pattern: individuals are arrested without warrants, held in secret locations, and never brought before a court, as reported by The Balochistan Post.According to The Balochistan Post, sources in Mand, Kech district, stated that Abdullah, son of Iqbal, was whisked away and shifted to an unknown facility. In Karachi, 24-year-old student Hamdan, son of Muhammad Ali, was detained by CTD officials in the Golimar area, with no subsequent legal proceedings or public acknowledgement of his custody.On November 2, 2025, three youths, Dawood Baloch, Usman Baloch, and Hakeem Majeed Baloch, were picked up during early-morning raids in Bhatta Colony by teams from Military Intelligence and the CTD. Their whereabouts remain undisclosed.Additional cases include the late-night detention of religious instructor Zubair from Quetta's Lak Pass area on November 20; the abduction of labourer Muhammad Iqbal Marri from outside the Rakhni Sessions Court in Barkhan on December 26; and the raid in Mastung on 11 December in which Frontier Corps and CTD personnel allegedly took 21-year-old herder Saeed Ahmed.Families say none of these detainees have resurfaced. According to another report, 17-year-old student Jamal Murad was apprehended in Gwadar on 2 January by CTD and Military Intelligence operatives, after which he disappeared.The Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP) continued its protest camp outside the Quetta Press Club, marking its 6,052nd day. Families, including the relatives of Nasreena Baloch, reportedly detained during a raid in Hub Chowki, joined the demonstration.Her family stated that local police refused to register an FIR, while the Hub Press Club was locked to stop their press briefing, as highlighted by The Balochistan Post.VBMP Chairman Nasrullah Baloch accused state institutions of weaponising national security to intensify enforced disappearances, even targeting Baloch women. He said detainees are denied legal rights, courts are bypassed, and new laws merely protect extrajudicial actions.He called on national and international bodies to take meaningful steps to end the crisis and secure the release of all missing persons, as reported by The Balochistan Post.","A fresh surge of enforced disappearances has been reported across Balochistan, Karachi, and adjoining regions.

No IMF Loan In 6 Months? Pakistan Defence Minister’s Jet Export Claim Collapses Under Debt Reality





Pakistan on Saturday claimed that Iraq has expressed “keen interest” in acquiring JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak training aircraft, following talks between the air chiefs of the two countries.According to a statement issued by the Pakistan Army, air chief marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu, chief of air staff of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF), met lieutenant general staff pilot Mohanad Ghalib Mohammed Radi Al-Asadi, commander of the Iraqi Air Force, during an official visit to Iraq.The discussions focused on enhancing bilateral military cooperation, including joint training, capacity building and operational coordination.“The Iraqi air chief praised PAF’s professionalism and technological advancement, expressed interest in benefiting from PAF’s world-class training and expressed keen interest in JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak trainer aircraft,” the statement said, as quoted by news agency PTI.Both sides also agreed to pursue joint exercises and training initiatives to strengthen interoperability between the two air forces.The JF-17 Thunder is a single-engine, lightweight combat aircraft jointly developed by China’s Chengdu Aircraft Corporation and the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex.Pakistan has claimed that the aircraft proved its capabilities during last year’s conflict with India, although its effectiveness remains disputed.Pakistan had also deployed Chinese-origin J-10 fighter jets during the May 7–10 hostilities with India.The development comes days after Pakistan and Bangladesh air chiefs held talks on the “potential procurement” of JF-17 jets by Dhaka. However, Bangladesh has not officially confirmed any such plan.Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif recently claimed that the country has seen increased interest in its fighter aircraft following the May 2025 standoff with India. Reports have also suggested that Pakistan is exploring similar defence deals with other countries, including Saudi Arabia, amid ongoing financial pressures.Notably, Pakistan has repeatedly relied on International Monetary Fund support in recent years, with the IMF approving a $7 billion bailout in September 2024 and an additional $1.4 billion loan in May 2025.",Iraq has expressed “keen interest’ in acquiring JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak training aircraft.
