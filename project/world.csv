RS passes waqf bill 128-95 as BJD boosts NDA numbers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rs-passes-waqf-bill-128-95-as-bjd-boosts-nda-numbers/articleshow/119993588.cms,"Budget session ends, both Houses adjourned sine die

NEW DELHI: The Rajya Sabha passed the Waqf (Amendment) Bill with 128 votes in favour and 95 against after a marathon 15-hour debate which started at 11am on Thursday and wound up around 2.30 am the next day.The lengthy debate, marked by acrimonious exchanges, ended with the opposition seeking a division and the bill sailing through with National Democratic alliance's (NDA's) 'secular' allies firmly in its corner.BJD's surprising decision to withdraw its whip to allow its seven members to vote as ""per their conscience"" brought a few extra votes for the governing side and took its tally beyond the anticipated 123 votes to 128. A minimum of 119 votes was required for passage, and BJP's deft floor management ensured a comfortable margin. The opposition bloc, expected to muster 98 votes, fell short at 95.The bill was passed in the Lok Sabha on Thursday after nearly 14 hours of discussion, with 288 members supporting it and 232 against it. With both Houses approving the bill, it now awaits President Droupadi Murmu's assent to amend the Waqf Act of 1995.Parliament also approved the Mussalman Wakf (Repeal) Bill, 2025, with the Rajya Sabha giving its nod. The lower house had earlier cleared the bill. The budget session of Parliament, which began on Jan 31, came to a close with both Houses being adjourned sine die on Friday.Replying to the debate, minority affairs minister Kiren Rijiju dismissed the opposition's charges as fear mongering, while putting up a spirited defence of the bill.""We have since yesterday consistently said that Muslims will constitute the overwhelming majority in both central waqf council and state waqf boards - 18 out of 22 and eight out of 11, in that order. Still, it was repeated ad nauseam that these bodies will be controlled by non-Muslims as a conspiracy to divest Muslims of their assets,"" the minister said.Rijiju, however, was blunt in saying that the two bodies could not be allowed to be exclusive Muslim entities either.""Their brief is not religious and disputes over waqf properties invariably involve non-Muslims,"" he said, adding that the central govt worked for all with the motto of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas'.The minister said the waqf board was a statutory body and, like all govt bodies, it should be secular. He said the inclusion of a few non-Muslims on the waqf board would not alter the decisions of the body and, instead, would add value.The waqf bill debates were the budget session's highlight, with the Rajya Sabha sitting until 4.02am on Friday - echoing a 1981 session on the Essential Services Maintenance Bill that lasted until 4.43am. Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar called the 15-hour debate ""unprecedented"".Historically, Parliament has seen marathon discussions. The longest, on the 'state of our democracy', spanned 20.08 hours in the Lok Sabha, followed by the 1993 Railway Budget (18.35 hours) and the 1998 Railway Budget (18.04 hours). This session also saw swift discussions on other matters, like the ratification of President's rule in Manipur, cleared in 42 minutes by the Lok Sabha and 1.24 hours by the Rajya Sabha.","The Rajya Sabha passed the Waqf (Amendment) Bill with 128 votes in favour and 95 against.

""The bill was passed according to the rules of the House. It is unfortunate that, despite following all parliamentary procedures, such allegations are being made,"" he said, underscoring that the process adhered to democratic standards.The Speaker, who refrained from making a direct reference to Sonia, emphasised that the bill underwent extensive deliberation, with Lok Sabha debating it for 13 hours and 53 minutes, followed by three rounds of voting.His response sparked protests from Congress benches. Congress members raised slogans as the Speaker delivered the valedictory address, ensuring a raucous end to the session. Sonia had made the remark while addressing a meeting of the Congress Parliamentary Party on Thursday. She termed the waqf bill a ""brazen assault on the Constitution"", and claimed that it pushed through without adequate discussion. Sonia was rebutted also by parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju . Raising the issue in LS, he urged the Speaker to issue an appropriate order. He dismissed the ""bulldozed"" charge as ""baseless and absurd"" and said the Rajya Sabha debate had set a new record for the longest discussion in the Upper House.Addressing a press conference later, Rijiju defended the bill's passage and said, ""There was not a single disruption during the discussion on the Waqf (Amendment) Bill.""Meanwhile, the opposition intensified its attack on the govt over another issue - US President Donald Trump's imposition of 26% reciprocal tariff on Indian goods. Congress MPs, including Rahul Gandhi, Gaurav Gogoi and Manish Tewari, moved adjournment motions in both Houses, warning of ""severe economic ramifications"" for sectors like automobiles, pharmaceuticals and agriculture. Rahul termed the tariff a potential ""devastation"" for India's economy and demanded that PM Narendra Modi address the House. Congress MP Amarinder Singh Raja Warring echoed this, while protests near Parliament's Makar Dwar underscored the party's discontent.","Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla sharply criticised former Congress president Sonia Gandhi for her remarks alleging that the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2025, was ""bulldozed"" He emphasised that the bill underwent extensive deliberation, with Lok Sabha debating it for 13 hours and 53 minutes, followed by three rounds of voting.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119991628,imgsize-1316363,width-400,resizemode-4/Sonia-Gandhi-Om-Birla.jpg"

B'desh says reports of attacks on minorities 'hugely inflated'

PM Modi on Friday asked Bangladesh chief adviser Muhammad Yunus to ensure safety and security of minorities, including Hindus, in the country and thoroughly investigate ""atrocities"" committed against them.In their first bilateral meeting since the formation of the interim govt in Dhaka in Aug 2024, Modi sought positive and constructive relationship with Bangladesh based on pragmatism, and urged Yunus to avoid rhetoric that could vitiate the atmosphere.However, as Modi broached the subject of minorities and increasing radicalisation, a Bangladesh readout said, Yunus called for a reality check against what he described as social media propaganda and said ties should be shaped on basis of principles like territorial integrity and non-interference in internal affairs.Yunus came to the meeting in Bangkok armed with his own list of issues Dhaka considers important, including the extradition of Sheikh Hasina , border killings, Saarc cooperation and pending Teesta water-sharing agreement. Even in the absence of any assurance that India would consider extraditing the ousted PM, Bangladesh authorities described the meeting as constructive and fruitful, but called upon India to restrain her from making inflammatory statements. Modi touched upon the issue of polls in Bangladesh as he reiterated India's support for a democratic, stable, peaceful, progressive, and inclusive neighbour. According to Bangladesh, Modi said India's ties are with the country and not with a political party or organisation.PM Modi underlined that India believed in a people-centric approach to the relationship and highlighted the cooperation between the two countries over a long period that has delivered tangible benefits to people in both countries,"" said foreign secretary Vikram Misri.According to Misri, the PM spoke at length about the issue of minorities, expressing deep concern over their plight and telling Yunus how violence against them impacts society in India too. He expressed hope Bangladesh would be able to fulfil its responsibility of protecting minority communities.However, the minority issue remained a sticking point as Yunus, according to the Bangladesh readout of the meeting, said the reports of attacks on minorities were hugely inflated and ""the bulk of them were fake news"". He asked Modi to send reporters to Bangladesh to investigate the alleged attacks themselves.""The chief adviser said he has instituted an effective system for monitoring every incident of religious and gender violence in the country, and his govt was taking serious actions to stop any occurrence of such incidents,"" said Dhaka in a statement.While calling for Hasina to be extradited, Yunus also accused the former PM of destabilising Bangladesh through her ""inflammatory"" statements from India, calling it an abuse of the hospitality extended to her by the Indian govt. He also accused Hasina of committing crimes against humanity, citing a UN report about the human rights violations under her govt.""We request that Indian govt take appropriate measures to restrain her from continuing to make such incendiary statements while she remains in your country,"" said Yunus. Interestingly, according to Dhaka, Modi blamed social media for tensions over Hasina's remarks and said India doesn't have special preference for any party or individual.He also said Bangladesh remained thankful for the ""unwavering support"" of the govt and people of India during its most challenging time in 1971. ""Excellency, we seek to work together with you to set the relationship on the right track for the benefit of both our peoples,"" said Yunus, according to Bangladesh.While Yunus raised the issue of border killings, Modi told him strict enforcement of the law and prevention of illegal border crossings, especially at night, are necessary for maintaining border security and stability. The Bangladesh readout quoted Modi as saying Indian border troops opened fire only in self-defence and the fatalities occurred in Indian territories. Yunus stressed it is important to address this issue to build trust between the countries.""PM expressed his conviction that all issues of mutual interest between the two countries would continue to be addressed and resolved bilaterally through constructive discussions, in the interest of their long standing and mutually beneficial bilateral relationship,"" said the Indian govt. Modi also congratulated Yunus for taking over as Bimstec Chair and Yunus sought India's support for a free trade agreement that the inter-regional group is discussing.",PM Modi meets Bangladesh's Muhammad Yunus on the sidelines of Bimstec Summit.

Since then, MNS activists have upped the ante. In one instance, police booked an MNS worker for slapping an SBI bank employee. Reacting to the incidents, the CM said while it was ""not wrong to demand Marathi in Maharashtra…if someone takes the law in his hand, then the law will take its course.""Tamhane in his letter to chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Thursday said, ""Some antisocial elements are indulging in acts such as threatening and beating up bank officials.

""If immediate action is not taken, we will be left with no choice but to escalate our protest, including strikes and other legal measures.""There have been several instances this week of bank staff being browbeaten by MNS activists in the wake of Thackeray's call. In Ambernath, MNS workers entered a Bank of Maharashtra branch and intimidated the manager, accusing him of failing to use the official state language while interacting with customers. A video capturing the confrontation went viral on social media. The clip showed the MNS men banging a table, shoving a computer monitor and shouting at the manager, demanding that he converse in Marathi. The bank manager appeared unfazed and told the MNS workers that as part of an all-India service, he was permitted to use any permissible language in official communications. ""One cannot be expected to learn the local language instantly; it takes time,"" he is heard saying in the video.In Thane, a group led by MNS city chief Ravindra More visited the Vartak Nagar branch of Karnataka Bank and asked the manager why the branch had failed to put up instructions in Marathi. They presented a Marathi alphabet book to the manager and removed an informative board printed in English, urging the administration to start displaying information in Marathi. MNS also issued a warning to staff of the postal department at Manpada, to ensure interaction with customers in Marathi.His colleague Sandeep Pachange appealed to management of schools not to discourage or penalise students from speaking in Marathi as it is the state's native language. A video also showed a group of MNS activists led by functionary Samiksha Markande confronting staff of a nationalised bank branch in Kopri after an employee initially refused to speak in Marathi. The video showed them warning they would stage a protest, following which the bank staff issued an apology.MNS workers visited banks in Ulhasnagar, where they tore down posters in English. In Lonavla, the police registered a non-cognisable offence against an MNS worker for slapping a bank employee during their conversation with the manager, an official said.In the video, MNS workers are seen arguing with the manager of the State Bank of India's Lonavla branch for not using Marathi and issuing warnings. When a Marathi-speaking employee of the bank tried to intervene, some party workers were seen slapping him and pushing him out of the cabin.

In a blunt message, US secretary of state Marco Rubio on Friday said Denmark must reckon with the reality that ""Greenlanders don't want to be a part of it.""""Denmark should focus on the fact that the Greenlanders don't want to be a part of Denmark,"" Rubio said following a Nato foreign ministers' meeting in Brussels. The remark adds a new edge to the ongoing diplomatic tension over Greenland, a semi-autonomous Danish territory rich in natural resources and strategically located in the Arctic.Rubio's comments come amid growing US interest in Greenland and rising concerns over potential Chinese influence in the region. He made it clear that while Washington respects Greenland's right to decide its own future, it will not allow the island to fall into China's economic orbit.""What we're not going to do is let China come in now and offer them a bunch of money, and become dependent on China,"" Rubio said, reiterating America's strategic concerns in the Arctic.Greenland, home to around 57,000 people, has long expressed a desire for independence.

The Fallout Begins



Timing Is Everything



Cyber Threats, Real and Present



Five Eyes intelligence community.

Capitol Hill Reacts

The Morale Problem

Demand for Answers

The abrupt dismissal of National Security Agency (NSA) Director General Timothy Haugh and his civilian deputy Wendy Noble has lit a firestorm of speculation across Washington’s national security circles. No official explanation has been offered by either the Pentagon or the White House. What’s left is a void—one rapidly filling with questions, theories, and quiet panic.That such a high-level purge would occur without context is startling enough. That it would happen at a time of escalating global cyber threats only deepens the unease. The NSA, America’s nerve centre for electronic espionage and cyber defence, now finds itself rudderless—its leadership ejected without warning or cause.General Haugh, a four-star Air Force officer, had led the NSA since February 2024 while simultaneously heading US Cyber Command. His dual-hatted role made him one of the most influential figures in American intelligence, responsible for countering adversaries like China and Russia in an increasingly volatile digital arena. Haugh’s tenure was defined by modernization initiatives and high-stakes cyber manoeuvring. His ouster, without even the courtesy of a press release, has left senior officials dumbfounded.Wendy Noble, his long-serving deputy, was similarly shown the door—“reassigned” to the Office of the Undersecretary of Defence for Intelligence. Noble had been with the NSA since 1987 and was revered as an institutional compass. Her removal wasn’t just surprising; it was unthinkable.In their place: Lt. Gen. William Hartmann, Haugh’s deputy at Cyber Command, has been installed as acting NSA director. Sheila Thomas, formerly the agency’s executive director, will serve as acting deputy. These temporary appointments may ensure bureaucratic continuity, but they don’t resolve the central mystery: Why were Haugh and Noble removed—and why now?Their exit coincided with a broader round of unexplained firings. That same day, several National Security Council staffers were dismissed, following a White House meeting between President Trump and far-right provocateur Laura Loomer. Loomer, a fringe activist with a flair for conspiracy and a direct line to Trump’s inner circle, reportedly urged the president to purge officials she deemed “disloyal” to his second-term agenda.The optics are damning. Within hours of Loomer’s Oval Office audience, some of the government’s most seasoned national security officials were out.Whether her influence was the spark or the excuse, it has turned a personnel decision into a political flashpoint.Critics, including former intelligence officials, worry the firings suggest a deeper rot: political purges dressed up as bureaucratic reshuffles. With no transparency, the most dangerous question is now the most logical one: was the NSA leadership removed for doing their jobs too well—or not politically enough?The stakes couldn’t be higher. Just weeks before the shake-up, US cyber analysts were responding to “Salt Typhoon,” a sophisticated intrusion attributed to Chinese state actors. The breach targeted secure government networks and demonstrated advanced exfiltration techniques—raising alarms across theTo remove seasoned cyber strategists in the middle of a high-profile response effort is more than questionable. It borders on sabotage.Intelligence veterans warn that leadership instability can hamstring operations, stall innovation, and weaken morale. The NSA doesn’t just intercept emails—it anchors America’s cyber defence posture. Shake that foundation, and the consequences ripple outward—from Wall Street servers to battlefield communications.Lawmakers from both parties are rattled, though Democrats have been more vocal. Some have called for hearings to uncover the rationale—or lack thereof—behind the dismissals. Others are pressing for answers about whether fringe advisers or political operatives outside traditional government channels influenced the firings.So far, silence.Without transparency, rumours flourish. Was there a clash over surveillance policy? A leak investigation gone too far? Or is this simply the latest chapter in a pattern of loyalty tests masquerading as governance?Inside the intelligence community, fear is metastasizing. Officials who have spent decades in government now whisper about “career risks” and “political unpredictability.” Haugh and Noble were not rebels; they were insiders. Professionals. Their removal sends a chilling message: even the most competent aren’t safe if they’re not in favor.It’s not just about cyber operations anymore. It’s about whether America’s intelligence agencies can function under an administration that seems more interested in obedience than expertise.Pressure is mounting. Advocacy groups, cybersecurity experts, and a growing chorus in Congress are demanding clarity. The public, too, deserves an explanation. The NSA is not a backroom agency—it is a bulwark of national security. The lights may still be on at Fort Meade, but the question remains: Who's pulling the plug? Until the White House steps forward with a credible account, the nation is left in the dark—hoping that its most sensitive defences haven’t just been compromised from within.",National Security Agency Director General Timothy Haugh and his civilian deputy Wendy Noble were dismissed without warning or cause.

Those kinds of – that kind of behavior is contrary to the basic compact we have as Americans.”Obama's comment on law firms referred to Trump's announcement of a deal with a law firm which agreed to provide at least $100 million in pro bono legal services throughout his second term. Interestingly, Kamala Harris's husband Doug Emhoff works at the firm -- Willkie Farr & Gallagher.Kamala Harris too spoke up against the administration after her long absence. “Fear has a way of being contagious.

A long-anticipated deal to shift TikTok’s US operations into American hands was nearly sealed, until US President Donald Trump’s sweeping new tariff announcement derailed it, according to sources familiar with the negotiations, reported news agency Associated Press.The Trump administration had been working for months to secure a plan that would see TikTok spun off into a new, US-based entity, backed by American investors and independent from ByteDance , its Chinese parent.According to AP, the near-finalised agreement had the backing of ByteDance, US investors, new stakeholders and administration officials. It also included a 120-day closing period to finalise paperwork and financing.US Vice President JD Vance’s team reportedly played a key role in crafting the deal alongside firms like Oracle and Blackstone.But on Thursday, just as the White House was preparing to announce a breakthrough, Beijing pulled back.According to a person familiar with the matter, ByteDance officials told the White House they could not move forward without fresh negotiations over trade and tariffs, following Trump’s announcement of broad global tariffs, including measures directly targeting China.This sudden policy move appears to have rattled Chinese regulators, leading to a pause in talks and uncertainty over ByteDance’s ability to send a clear signal about the deal’s terms without endangering its standing with Beijing.The timing of the collapse has sparked questions over whether Trump’s aggressive trade stance unintentionally sabotaged the very deal his administration had spent months pursuing.The President’s response was to sign an executive order Friday, delaying enforcement of a federal law banning TikTok unless ByteDance divests. The extension grants another 75 days, pushing the new deadline to mid-June.“My Administration has been working very hard on a Deal to save TikTok… which is why I am signing an Executive Order to keep TikTok up and running for an additional 75 days,” Trump posted on Truth Social.While Trump framed it as an extension, critics argue it’s more of a legal bypass. “He’s not extending anything,” law professor Alan Rozenshtein told AP. “All he’s doing is saying that he will not enforce the law for 75 more days. The law is still in effect.”ByteDance confirmed talks were ongoing but warned that “any agreement will be subject to approval under Chinese law.”Analysts say the heart of the deal remains the control of TikTok’s powerful algorithm.Cybersecurity expert Chris Pierson told AP that as long as ByteDance retains that control, “the underlying risks” remain unchanged.","Deal to spin off TikTok's US operations was nearly sealed, according to sources.

Rumeysa Ozturk: Judge transfers case of detained Turkish PhD student Rumeysa Ozturk to Vermont,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/judge-transfers-case-of-detained-turkish-phd-student-rumeysa-ozturk-to-vermont/articleshow/119993601.cms,"Judge transfers case of detained Turkish PhD student Rumeysa Ozturk to Vermont (Picture credit: AP)

A federal judge on Friday ordered the case of Rumeysa Ozturk , a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University , to be moved from Massachusetts to Vermont , where she was briefly held after her arrest by immigration officers last week.Ozturk’s lawyers had filed a petition for her release in Boston, but the department of justice sought to dismiss it or shift it to Louisiana , where she is currently detained.US district judge Denise Casper ruled Vermont was the appropriate venue since Ozturk was held overnight in St Albans, Vermont, when the habeas petition was filed. “Here, because Ozturk was confined overnight in Vermont when the petition was filed, the District of Vermont is the proper transferee court,” Casper wrote in her decision, as per news agency AP.Casper rejected the government’s argument that the case should be moved to Louisiana, stating the transfer to Vermont serves “the interest of justice.” She also blocked any attempt to remove Ozturk from the US until Vermont courts decide on jurisdiction.According to NBC News, the deportation ban remains in place unless lifted by the transferee court.Ozturk was arrested on March 25 in Somerville, Massachusetts, after her student visa was revoked. Footage showed Homeland Security agents in plain clothes surrounding her and placing her in a vehicle as she screamed. After stops in New Hampshire and Vermont, she was flown to Louisiana the next day.Ozturk’s lawyers said her sudden arrest and cross-state transfer were attempts to manipulate jurisdiction and prevent her from challenging her detention. Judge Casper acknowledged this concern, writing that “the irregularity of the arrest, detention and processing… is coupled with the failure to disclose Ozturk's whereabouts” even after the government knew she had legal representation.As per CBS News, the department of homeland security has accused Ozturk, without offering evidence, of supporting Hamas, which the US classifies as a terrorist organisation. However, her lawyers argue that her detention violates her First Amendment rights and due process protections.Ozturk had co-authored a Tufts Daily op-ed last year criticising the university’s stance on student resolutions calling for divestment from companies linked to Israel.On Thursday, her attorney released a statement from Ozturk in which she reaffirmed her commitment to justice and dialogue: “I believe the world is a more beautiful and peaceful place when we listen to each other and allow different perspectives to be in the room.”“Let’s be clear: Rumeysa should never have been arrested or detained by ICE in the first place,” said her lawyer Mahsa Khanbabai, as per AP. “What matters most right now is our continued fight to ensure her immediate release and safe return home”, Khanbabai added.","Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University, was briefly held after her arrest by immigration officers last week.

Supreme Court Decision: Supreme Court backs Trump in scrapping $600m education grants linked to DEI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/supreme-court-backs-trump-in-scrapping-600m-education-grants-linked-to-dei/articleshow/119992911.cms,"File photo: US President Donald Trump (Picture credit: AP)

The US Supreme Court on Friday handed a major victory to the Trump administration by allowing it to terminate over $600 million in federal teacher-training grants , part of its broader campaign to dismantle diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.The 5-4 decision overruled a lower court’s block on the cuts, marking US President Donald Trump’s first Supreme Court win in his second term.The court’s conservative majority, minus Chief Justice John Roberts who sided with the liberal justices in dissent, said the government was not legally bound to continue payments under the Teacher Quality Partnership and Supporting Effective Educator Development programs.These grants, focused on preparing teachers in critical subjects such as science, maths, and special education, have shown strong results in improving retention, particularly in under-resourced schools, according to multiple states challenging the decision.According to CNBC News, the Trump administration argued the programs violated a new executive order aimed at eliminating DEI-related spending. Education officials described the grants as “woke” and unnecessary, and had halted payments abruptly in February without prior notice.In response, a coalition of eight Democrat-led states led by California sued the federal government, saying the cancellation lacked legal justification and disproportionately impacted efforts to address America’s worsening teacher shortage.A federal judge in Boston, Myong Joun, appointed by the previous US President Joe Biden, initially blocked the cuts through a temporary restraining order, saying the cancellations likely violated federal law and were already harming teacher development programs. However, the Supreme Court’s majority ruled the states could maintain the programs using their own funds for now, arguing the federal government would have no way to recover the money if it ultimately prevails in the case.Justice Elena Kagan, writing in dissent, criticised the court’s intervention as unnecessary and hasty. “Nowhere in its papers does the government defend the legality of canceling the education grants at issue here,” she wrote, with Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson adding in a separate opinion that it was “beyond puzzling” to treat the administration’s request as an emergency.As per news agency AP, this legal fight is just one of several where lower courts have delayed or blocked Trump’s second-term agenda, prompting his administration to escalate disputes to the Supreme Court. Trump has also signed an executive order calling for the dismantling of the Department of Education, pushing to eliminate DEI elements across government institutions.California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, New York and Wisconsin remain parties in the ongoing lawsuit as the legal battle continues.","The US Supreme Court on Friday handed a major victory to the Trump administration by allowing it to terminate over $600 million in federal teacher- training grants.

Inter-American Foundation: Federal judge blocks Donald Trump’s attempt to dismantle Inter-American Foundation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/federal-judge-blocks-donald-trumps-attempt-to-dismantle-inter-american-foundation/articleshow/119992000.cms,"File photo: US President Donald Trump (Picture credit: PTI)

A US federal judge on Friday blocked US President Donald Trump’s move to dismantle the Latin America development agency , Inter-American Foundation (IAF), ruling that the administration likely overstepped its authority when it removed the agency’s leadership and froze its grants.US district judge Loren AliKhan , an appointee of US President Joe Biden, ordered that ousted IAF president and CEO Sara Aviel be reinstated immediately and blocked the Trump administration ’s efforts to dissolve the agency’s operations. “Because neither President Trump nor Mr Marocco had the authority to fire her from her position… Ms. Aviel is likely to succeed on the merits of her case,” AliKhan wrote in her decision, according to the news agency Associated Press.Established by Congress in 1969, the IAF is an independent US agency that funds grassroots development efforts to combat poverty, migration and instability in Latin America and the Caribbean. Since its inception, the agency has disbursed more than $945 million in grants across roughly three dozen countries.Trump had signed an executive order on February 19 aiming to drastically shrink the federal government, listing the IAF among the agencies to be “eliminated to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law,” reported The Hill. The following day, representatives from the department of government efficiency (DOGE), led by Trump advisor Elon Musk, appeared at IAF’s offices.Days later, the administration removed the agency’s board, fired Aviel, and installed Peter Marocco as acting board chair. Marocco, who had previously worked on dismantling the US agency for international development, later appointed himself as Aviel’s temporary replacement.As per The Hill, the IAF was left with just one employee and one active grant.AliKhan’s order invalidated Marocco’s role and actions, including the cancellation of nearly all IAF grants and plans to fire most of its staff. “If those terminations go into effect, those staff will never return,” Aviel’s attorneys warned, adding that the foundation’s long-standing relationships and reputation in Latin America would be “gutted,” AP reported.Nine grantee organisations have also sued to preserve the agency, including groups that combat school violence in Peru, support rural women in Mexico, and train small-scale farmers. Several have already laid off employees or are facing closure.The justice department argued that Trump lawfully replaced the board and that the administration’s actions were part of broader efforts to ensure government leadership aligns with the president’s goals. But judge AliKhan pushed back strongly. “That reading eviscerates the Appointments Clause,” she wrote, calling the administration’s theory of unchecked executive power “frightening,” reported The Hill.","US district judge Loren AliKhan ordered that ousted IAF president and CEO Sara Aviel be reinstated immediately.

Maryland man Kilmar Abrego Garcia to be returned to US?

Who is Abrego Garcia?



Maryland man Kilmar Abrego Garcia who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador last month has to be brought back to the US no later than 11.59 pm on April 7, a federal judge ruled Friday. This came after the Trump administration, in a surprise move, acknowledged that they did a mistake deporting the Maryland father of three because of an administrative order. The government said they could not bring him because he is in Salvadoran custody.“This case is certainly important to Abrego Garcia and his family,” judge Paula Xinis said. “In recognition of that. I feel like I can’t wait on giving my order.”During the hearing, the judge flagged that Garcia was apprehended last month without legal basis and deported without justification. Garcia's alleged ties to the MS-13 gang which Trump officials maintained did not have sufficient evidence, the judge said.“When someone is accused of membership in such a violent and predatory organization, it comes in the form of an indictment, complaint, criminal proceeding that has a robust process,” she said. The Justice Department didn’t provide additional evidence beyond what’s already been submitted in the case. “The government made a choice here to produce no evidence,” DOJ attorney Erez Reuveni told the judge.Abrego Garcia, 29, was among the hundreds of alleged members of crime gangs MS-13 and Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua the government expelled from the US to El Salvador last month. He fled El Salvador as a teenager to escape gang violence. On March 12, he was pulled over by ICE agents near his home and three days later he was expelled and sent back to El Salvador even though he won a legal battle six years earlier barring his removal.Abrego Garica’s wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, and their 5-year-old son, who are both US citizens, sued the government demanding his return.","Maryland man Kilmar Abrego Garcia has to be brought back to the US no later than 11.59 pm on April 7, a federal judge ruled Friday.

Trump's tariff team: Who stands for what



Trump tariffs and their aftershocks



A White House official told Washington Post that President Donald Trump is ""at the peak of just not giving a f**k anymore"", explaining the rationale behind the reciprocratory tariffs that the president announced on April 2. ""Bad news stories? Doesn't give a f**k. He's going to do what he's going to do. He's going to do what he promised to do on the campaign trail,"" a Washington Post report quoted a White House official as saying.The report said the president was given a menu of tariff options, but he personally selected a formula to arrive at the percentage of tariffs for countries. The formula was based on two simple variables -- the trade deficit with each country and the total value of its US exports, the report said.Several rounds of meetings were held on Tuesday, the day before the announcement and Trump didn't decide on the final plan until around 1pm Wednesday, less than three hours ahead of his Rose Garden announcement.There were reports of internal fighting among the aides over the tariff formula but the Washington report said it was far less than the first term. “In the first term,” said a senior White House official, “everyone thought they were president.”Trump's tariff team comprised Peter Navarro, Trump’s senior trade counselor; Scott Bessent, the treasury secretary; Howard Lutnick, commerce secretary; Jamieson Greer, U.S. trade representative; Stephen Miller, deputy chief of staff for policy; Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council; and Vice President JD Vance. Chief of Staff Susie Wiles was also in the meetings. Hassett was not present for the final meeting Wednesday.Navarro was the strongest champion of taking aggressive measures; Miller and Vance left it for the president to decide.China retaliated with a 34 per cent tariff on all US products. The Commerce Ministry in Beijing also said in a notice that it will impose more export controls on rare earths, which are materials used in high-tech products such as computer chips and electric vehicle batteries. Beijing announced it had filed a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization over the tariff issue. Trump said it was wrong of China and they panicked. He also informed that Vietnam expressed interest in reducing tariffs on the US.",Donald Trump personally chose the formula based on which the tariffs were decided.

The White House has postponed its annual spring garden tour originally set for Saturday, citing security concerns over a “massive” anti-Trump protest expected near the premises. The tours will now take place on Sunday, April 6, between 10 am (local time) and 2:30 pm (local time), with all previously issued tickets for Saturday honoured regardless of the original time slots, confirmed a statement from the First Lady’s office.“This decision has been made out of an abundance of caution and to ensure the safety of all within proximity to public demonstrations planned near the White House on April 5,” said the official statement.The change comes as the “Hands Off!” rally, part of a National Day of Action , is set to draw more than 12,000 demonstrators to the National Mall, according to Washingtonian magazine.Organisers say the protest is a response to what they describe as “a hostile takeover” of the American government and economy by US President Trump and his wealthy allies. “Trump, Musk, and their billionaire cronies are orchestrating an all-out assault on our government, our economy, and our basic rights,” reads a statement on the movement’s website.The demonstration is expected to be the largest single-day protest since Trump took office.As per Axios, more than 1,100 rallies and events are being held across all 50 states, with nearly 250,000 RSVPs recorded by March 29. Protesters plan to rally against a wide array of policies linked to Trump, including attacks on consumer protections, transgender rights, Social Security benefits, and immigration. The involvement of Elon Musk in federal governance via DOGE has also drawn criticism, further fuelling the movement.While President Trump is not scheduled to be in Washington during the protests—he is expected to attend a LIV Golf event in Doral, Florida, and later visit Mar-a-Lago—security agencies remain on alert.The White House has said it is “working closely with the United States Secret Service and National Park Service to safely accommodate all ticket holders,” reported The Hill.The annual spring garden tours offer the public a rare chance to view iconic areas like the Rose Garden, the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden and the White House Kitchen Garden. The tours are free, but tickets are distributed on a first-come-first-served basis outside the White House Visitor Center.Melania Trump first announced the April 5–6 tour dates last month.Sunday tourgoers are expected to arrive at their scheduled times, while Saturday’s attendees can use their tickets without rescheduling.","The White House has postponed its annual spring garden tour originally set for Saturday, citing security concerns.

Who are the militant groups?



Which are the most affected regions?



What are the consequences of the rising violence?



More than 100 deadly attacks in Pakistan by Islamist militants and separatist rebels made March the deadliest month over a decade with 335 people killed, a think tank reported Thursday.Of the deaths, 228 were caused by militant groups, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) think tank. They included 73 members of security services, including soldiers and police officers, 67 civilians and 88 militants.The Islamist-militant Pakistani Taliban, or Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and the separatist rebel Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) were the main militant groups responsible for the attacks.The BLA was responsible for a 28-hour hijacking of the train Jaffar Express in the southwestern region Balochistan. Some 450 people were held hostage and more than two dozen were killed.Balochistan was the most affected province, followed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the northwest of Pakistan.They have both also been targets of suicide bombings, a form of attacks that surged in March.In Punjab, the eastern province bordering India, the think tank observed a strong increase in militant activity.At least seven attacks were recorded, and most were attributed to the TTP.In response to the growing threat, Pakistan's security forces have intensified their operations in the region. Many people have been arrested with connections to militant groups, including the TTP.Islamabad claims that most attacks, both by militants and rebels, are planned and executed from Afghanistan. It accuses the neighboring country of granting Pakistani militants space to plan and organize attacks.A recent report by the United Nations supported this claim. It said that the Taliban provided support to the TTP and that some attacks were launched from Afghan territory.As a consequence, the Pakistani government has urged the ruling Taliban in Afghanistan to act against the allegedly responsible criminals. Kabul, on the other hand, denies that the militants are in Afghanistan.","Of the deaths, 228 were caused by militant groups, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.

He maintains his innocence, asserting that the charges are politically driven.","Imran Khan has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for his contributions to human rights and democratic values.

For Afghans like Zahra, a 32-year-old mother in Rawalpindi, the stakes are personal: “We fled war once.
