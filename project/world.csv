LONDON: UK shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel has called on the British government to intervene in the ""increase in violence"" in Bangladesh that has involved murders of Hindus and use its influence to bring about stability in the country.The British Indian Opposition Conservative MP posted her letter to Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper on social media on Friday, which also calls upon the Labour Party government to make a statement on the issue in the House of Commons.""The situation in Bangladesh is very concerning.

Given the increase in violence, can you advise what steps have been taken over the last year to monitor and make representations?""Given the wider political situation in Bangladesh, what work is underway with partners in the region to use our diplomatic influence and convening powers to bring about stability in Bangladesh and respect and protections for minorities,"" she questions in her letter.Meanwhile, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has condemned a ""disturbing pattern"" of recurring attacks on minorities in Bangladesh.""We continue to witness a disturbing pattern of recurring attacks on minorities as well as their homes and businesses by extremists. Such communal incidents need to be dealt with swiftly and firmly,"" MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.""We have observed a troubling tendency to attribute such incidents to personal rivalries, political differences, or extraneous reasons.

BMC Becomes Mega Battleground As Thackerays Reunite And Alliances Shift Ahead Of Civic Wars 2026

PUNE: Estranged cousins Ajit Pawar and Supriya Sule came together for the first time on a political platform on Saturday to release the joint manifesto of NCP and NCP (SP) for the Pune civic polls nearly two-and-a-half years after the split in the family and party. However, both remained non-committal on a possible merger of their outfits. ""Wait and watch,"" said Ajit Pawar, without giving a specific answer to the issue of speculation over the parties' merger.Ajit Pawar's NCP and Sharad Pawar's NCP (SP) formed an alliance for the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporation elections despite being on opposite sides in the state govt and at the Centre. NCP is with the governing alliance in both govts, while NCP (SP) is in the opposition. After the two NCPs forged the alliance, some workers from both sides were disappointed. Speaking on the issue, Sule said, ""When any alliance is formed, some party workers get disappointed. But we will not leave them on their own. On both sides of the alliance, our focus is on workers and not on netas.""When Sule was asked about her absence in the Pune municipal corporation (PMC) and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporation (PCMC) poll campaign, her cousin Ajit Pawar came to the rescue.""She told me to take the lead in the campaign as I am older to her and promised that she would follow me,"" he said. The PMC will go to polls with 28 other municipal corporations in the state on Jan 15.The bonhomie between members of the two parties was visible during the release of the joint manifesto. They had trained guns on each other during the Lok Sabha and assembly polls in 2024 following the split in NCP in July 2023. Sharad Pawar's NCP (SP) approached the court against Ajit Pawar's NCP, claiming ownership of the party's name and the ""clock"" symbol.Asked about speculation over the parties coming together when the case was still in court, the deputy chief minister said, ""We respect the court's order and follow it. As far as the solution to the issue is concerned, Supriya and I will sit together and find it on our own; nobody else needs to bother about it.""",Ajit Pawar and Supriya Sule came together for the first time on a political platform.

Ayodhya Faced Conspiracies But Sanatan Prevailed, UP CM Yogi Adityanath Says At Ram Temple Event

AYODHYA/LUCKNOW: A 55-year-old man from Kashmir entered the Ram temple in Ayodhya and attempted to offer namaz near a restricted area on Saturday evening, sending security posted at the complex into a tizzy.The person, identified as Abu Ahmad Sheikh (55), was detained as he was trying to offer namaz near the southern circumambulatory corridor of the Ram Janmabhoomi complex, close to Sita Rasoi.Sheikh is a resident of Wodapora village in J&K's Shopian district. Officials said he had completed darshan and was exiting the premises when security personnel noticed his actions and immediately restrained him.Sources said the man raised slogans after being stopped, following which intelligence agencies and police swung into action. He was taken to the Ram Janmabhoomi police outpost, and was being questioned under the supervision of SP (security) Balramachari Dubey.Ayodhya SSP Gaurav Grover said the man's antecedents were being verified and a detailed report had been sought from J&K Police. No suspicious object was recovered from him, Grover said.The district administration and the Ram Temple Trust had not issued any statement till late evening.The incident inside the high-security temple complex has brought Ayodhya's security architecture under sharp focus. Several former DGPs TOI spoke to said the shrine's protection must remain uncompromising and should be constantly evolving in view of its religious significance, high footfalls and rising threat perception. Since the consecration of Ram Lalla, around 1.5 lakh devotees have been visiting the shrine daily on an average.In view of repeated threats and high footfall at the complex, the state is planning a permanent NSG hub in Ayodhya to strengthen rapid response to terror threats and high-risk situations.","The man, identified as Abu Ahmad Sheikh (55), was detained as he was trying to offer namaz near the southern circumambulatory corridor of the Ram Janmabhoomi complex.

MUMBAI: Just four days before her retirement on Jan 3, former DGP Rashmi Shukla submitted a report to the state home department saying an offence should be registered against ex-DGP and former Mumbai police commissioner Sanjay Pandey, along with two other police officers, for conspiring to arrest Devendra Fadnavis, who was opposition leader, and Eknath Shinde, who was UD minister, during the tenure of the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) govt.An SIT was formed to probe the issue raised in the assembly by MLC Pravin Darekar, and it submitted its report to the govt. Shukla was asked to submit her opinion on the report. Pandey declined to comment.The SIT had investigated the allegation of a criminal conspiracy to implicate Fadnavis and Shinde in an urban land ceiling (ULC) certificates scam case. The scam pertained to builders who allegedly submitted bogus ULC certificates and were exempted from surrendering 5% excess land to govt. During the MVA govt's tenure, Thane police had investigated businessman Sanjay Punamia, who was in a dispute with his business partner Shaymsundar Agarwal, in the scam. Afterwards, Punamia had alleged he was pressured to give a statement against Fadnavis and Shinde.Shukla suggested the govt register an FIR against Pandey and police officers Laxmikant Patil and Sardar Patil for criminal conspiracy, a public servant disobeying the law, fabricating evidence, threatening a person to give a false statement, and for conspiring to implicate Fadnavis and Shinde in an old case registered in Thane in 2016.A retired police officer said there is no provision in law where a mere alleged intention to arrest, when no arrest was made, becomes an offence.Laxmikant Patil, then DCP, crime, Thane, used a govt vehicle to visit Mantralaya, Vidhan Bhavan, office of the DGP and Sahyadri guest house in Mumbai, but instead of mentioning the exact location, his drivers wrote only ""Mumbai"" in the vehicle's log book. It was also alleged Laxmikant Patil exerted pressure on the accused and witnesses. It was further said Shukla found that while Punamia was in custody in a 2021 case registered in Thane, Patil interrogated him regarding the ULC scam and pressurised him to give a false statement that Fadnavis extorted money from builders. Retired ACP Sardar Patil was investigating the case.The investigating officer conducted a re-investigation on the basis of an application submitted by one Raju Shaha to the then DGP Pandey in May 2021. The chargesheet in the case was submitted in 2017. The SIT said that on the instruction of Pandey, Laxmikant Patil arranged an appointment for Shaha with him (then DGP) for submission of an application, based on which police started the re-investigation of the Thane case with an intention to implicate Fadnavis and Shinde. Subsequently, Pandey became Mumbai police commissioner, and he allegedly pressured a junior officer to file charges against Fadnavis in an offence registered with cyber police in BKC. Pandey spent five months in jail after retirement on charges of alleged money laundering.BJP Mumbai president Ameet Satam said there ""was an invisible hand which was none other than that of then CM Uddhav Thackeray"" behind Pandey's act.","Former DGP Rashmi Shukla submitted a report to govt just 4 days before her retirement on Jan 3 against ex-DGP and former Mumbai police commissioner Sanjay Pandey.

Supreme Court Directs Dogs Be Shifted From Schools, Bus Stands To Shelters; Petitioner Breaks Down

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday continued hearing pleas seeking changes to its earlier order on stray dogs, with actor Sharmila Tagore appearing as one of the applicants through her counsel.The top court sharply pushed back against the submissions made on Tagore’s behalf, saying such arguments were “completely removed from reality.""Appearing for Tagore, counsel told the court that there cannot be a “one size fits all” solution when it comes to stray dogs on the streets. It said the issue must be looked at through science and psychology, adding that while the Animal Birth Control (ABC) rules may not be perfect, they need to be reviewed, not discarded.The counsel said the law already recognises a difference between normal street dogs and aggressive dogs and argued that some aggressive dogs can improve after treatment and behavioural care, though it accepted that aggression can return in some cases. Such dogs, he said, must be clearly identified by designated committees.When the Counsel cited example of a long-standing stray dog at AIIMS, the court said any dog living on the streets is likely to carry ticks and warned that allowing such animals inside hospitals could have “disastrous consequences”. The judges told the counsel not to romanticise the presence of dogs in sensitive public spaces.""Was she being taken to the hospital theatre also? Any dog that’s in the streets is bound to have ticks.And a dog with ticks in a hospital will have disastrous consequences. Do you understand? We’ll let you know the reality of what is being argued. You (the dog lover’s side) are completely removed from reality. Don’t try to glorify these dogs in the hospitals,"" the bench said.Suggestions like colour-coded collars to identify dogs with a history of biting were also raised by Tagore's counsel, citing examples from other countries. The court questioned the comparison and asked lawyers to remain realistic, pointing to differences in population size.The Supreme Court was hearing petitions seeking modification of its earlier directions in the stray dog matter.",Supreme Court on Friday continued hearing pleas seeking changes to its earlier order on stray dogs.

'No Courage, No Strength': Lt Gen Katiyar Ridicules Pak, Exposes Terror Strategy, Warns Against War

CHANDIGARH: Clarifying that the death of a soldier cannot be solely attributed to alcohol consumption, Armed Force Tribunal has held that other service-related factors, including deployment on higher altitude are also contributing factors, reports Ajay Sura. The tribunal passed these orders while granting special family pension to the widow of an IAF soldier who died from a fatal medical condition at 1,500m Kurseong in Darjeeling (West Bengal).A division bench comprising Justice Suresh Kumar Gupta, judicial member, and Major General Sanjay Singh (Retd.), administrative member, of Lucknow bench of AFT passed these orders while allowing an application filed by Kavita Talan, wife of late Corporal Jasvindra Singh Talan. The tribunal held that her husband's death occurred in the performance of official duty. Talan died on July 15, 2015.During the hearing, govt argued that medical summary shows Talan was a 'regular alcohol consumer' for six years prior to his death. The bench observed attributing the death solely to alleged alcohol consumption was unsustainable & lacked a definitive medical basis.","Armed Force Tribunal has held that other service-related factors, including deployment on higher altitude are also contributing factors.

Why Is Divorce Still Treated Like a Sin? The Truth Society Refuses to Accept | Anand Handa

AHMEDABAD: Gujarat HC ruled that terms and conditions agreed during the divorce are fully enforceable and executable by a family court, which earlier refused to direct a divorced woman to relinquish her rights in a joint property with her ex-husband.The couple involved in this case married in 2008 in Ahmedabad. They had a daughter in 2015 and got a divorce decree from the family court in 2019 by mutual consent. Their petition under Section 13B of Hindu Marriage Act included various terms and conditions for peaceful separation, including that daughter's custody would be with the mother, and she would relinquish her ownership rights in a flat in Vastrapur and cooperate in getting the release deed registered with the sub-registrar.In 2021, when the husband requested his ex-wife to give up her property rights as agreed in the petition, the woman dragged her feet and asked him to transfer the right to their daughter instead. The man approached the family court and sought execution of the settlement to remove the wife's name from the property records.In 2023, the family court declined relief, holding that the divorce decree did not specifically direct execution of a document.The family court said that if the petitioner was desirous of getting the release deed executed, he could do so by filing a separate suit seeking specific performance of the agreement according to the provisions of the Specific Relief Act.The man challenged family court's order. A bench of Justice Sangeeta Vishen and Justice Nisha Thakore quashed the order and held that once settlement terms are incorporated into a consent divorce decree, they become part of the decree itself & must be enforced in execution.The HC questioned whether the wife was permitted to turn around and raise a grievance against the divorce deed and judgment after accepting the family court's decree once. It further said, ""Also, the family court, for executing the decree, cannot relegate the party to file a separate suit for the issues already agreed and judgment having passed in terms thereof. If such a course is allowed, it would go against the spirit of the Act of 1984 as well as the Act of 1955, as the central theme underlying both the legislations is to lessen the litigation, providing early resolution to the disputes between the parties.

NAGPUR: Reiterating the limits of judicial intervention at the threshold stage, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court recently held that the inherent powers under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) cannot be invoked to stifle a legitimate prosecution, particularly when the allegations disclose a prima facie offence requiring trial.A division bench comprising Justices Urmila Joshi Phalke and Nandesh Deshpande dismissed a criminal application filed by a businessman from Buldhana, seeking quashing of an FIR registered at Ramtek police station in Nagpur (rural) on April 6, 2025, for offences including abetment of suicide under Section 108 of BNS.After a man died by suicide on April 2, 2025, his wife lodged a complaint alleging that the petitioner drew her husband into a partnership venture for supplying shed-nets to farmers under a govt scheme, persuaded him to obtain bank loans, and later failed to supply material or repay dues. As per the FIR, farmers repeatedly approached the man, while bank officials demanded repayment. The woman alleged her husband died by suicide due to the pressure coupled with harassment.Additional govt pleader Neeraj Jawade opposed the petition which was filed under CrPC Section 482 for quashing the FIR. The bench underscored settled legal principles governing abetment while rejecting the petition. ""For attracting offence under Section 108 of BNS, what is required is a direct or proximate act which leads the deceased to commit suicide,"" the court observed, adding that such an act must have a clear nexus with the suicide.On examining the FIR, the judges said, it ""spells out detailed methodology of the petitioner to drive persons like the husband of the complainant to commit suicide,"" holding that prima facie material existed against the businessman. The bench also noted the prosecution's submission that similar FIRs for identical offences were registered against the petitioner, reinforcing the need for a full-fledged trial.Emphasising judicial restraint, the court said the extraordinary powers under Section 482 of CrPC must be exercised ""sparingly and with great circumspection"" and cannot be used to ""stifle legitimate prosecution"". Allegations and counter-allegations, it added, must be tested ""on the anvil of cross-examination"" during trial.Relying on Supreme Court precedent, including the State of Madhya Pradesh versus Laxmi Narayan case, the bench concluded that this case did not warrant interference at the investigation stage. The businessman's criminal application was rejected, clearing the way for the probe to continue.",Nagpur bench of Bombay high court recently held that the inherent powers under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) cannot be invoked to stifle a legitimate prosecution.

Preventive detention can't be to prolong custody: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/preventive-detention-cant-be-to-prolong-custody-supreme-court/articleshow/126458206.cms,".

Detention order lacks proof of public threat: SC

New Delhi: Observing that preventive detention can't be used just to prolong the custody of stubborn offenders, the SC has said it cannot be invoked because there is apprehension that an accused may not mend ways and commit another crime after getting bail.SC said if an accused commits fresh offence while on bail, then it can be handled under ordinary law by seeking cancellation of bail or by challenging bail in higher courts, but it cannot be the sole reason for ordering preventive detention.Quashing the preventive detention of a woman facing 3 cases under NDPS Act, the court held ""mere apprehension on the part of the detaining authority that in the event of the detenu being released on bail, she was likely to indulge in similar crimes that would be prejudicial to maintenance of public order would not be a sufficient ground to order her preventive detention"".In this case, the accused was in judicial custody but the Hyderabad collector had ordered to detain her if she gets bail to prevent her from committing crime.he authority, suspecting that she would return to peddling ganja, said, “I strongly believe that you are not amenable to ordinary law, unless you are detained by an appropriate order of detention as a last resort, in the interest of public at large”.The accused challenged the order in Telangana HC on ground that detention order was passed merely as an alternative to cancellation of bail. HC rejected her plea and was of the view that repeated and well-planned actions of the detenu were sufficient to raise presumption of threat and alarm amongst the public regarding their health. SC quashed the HC order and said, “Detention order ought to indicate the recording of subjective satisfaction by the detaining authority in that regard. It is well settled that there is a fine distinction between ‘law and order’ and ‘public order’.Mere registration of three offences by itself would not have any bearing on maintenance of public order unless there is material to show that narcotic drug dealt with by detenu was in fact dangerous to public health under the Act of 1986. This material is found to be missing in the order of detention.” The court said detention order does not indicate in what manner the maintenance of public order was either adversely affected or was likely to be adversely affected so as to detain the detenu.It said that if the detaining authority was of the view that detenu had violated any conditions of bail, steps for cancellation of her liberty could have been taken but noted that it was not done in this case.","SC said if an accused commits fresh offence while on bail, then it can be handled under ordinary law.

NEW DELHI: Indian military retaliation against the terror attack in Pahalgam led Pakistan to frantically seek US mediation to make New Delhi pause the strikes deep inside its territory.Disclosures from US FARA (Foreign Agents Registration Act) filings reveal that between May 7, when IAF struck headquarters of JeM, LeT and Hizbul Mujahideen, and May 10, when Pakistan director general of military operations Major General Kashif Abdullah rang up his Indian counterpart Lt General Rajiv Ghai, Islamabad had launched an urgent lobbying campaign in Washington.

The details are part of the filings by Squire Patton Boggs, hired by Pakistan for lobbying and which, like other US lobbying firms, are mandated to share with the US Department of Justice, the details and nature of their dealings.A majority of meetings were sought between the onset of Operation Sindoor and the eventual suspension of India's military operations with requests to secure American mediation to ""somehow halt"" India's retaliatory military operations.While Pakistan tried to dismiss the impact of India's strikes, the records confirm a high-level of behind-the-scenes panic.Pakistan had hired lobbying firm Squire Patton Boggs originally to help it steer away from FATF grey list.

NEW DELHI: Bangladesh's interim government on Thursday announced that it has asked its key diplomatic missions in India, including the High Commission in New Delhi, to temporarily suspend visa services citing ""security concerns"".""What I have done is that I have asked our three missions (in India) to keep their visa sections closed for the time being. It's a security issue,"" Foreign affairs adviser M Touhid Hossain told reporters at a media briefing.The remarks came after Bangladesh's Deputy High Commission in Kolkata overnight restricted visa services, following similar steps taken earlier in New Delhi and Agartala.However, business and work visas have been kept outside the scope of the restrictions. Bangladesh also has diplomatic missions in Mumbai and Chennai, where visa services continue to operate normally.Hossain also said Bangladesh has approached the United States seeking a reversal of a recently imposed visa bond requirement. Dhaka will pursue diplomatic channels to seek an exemption, calling the move ""certainly unfortunate and painful for us,"" PTI reported.At the same time, he noted that the US decision was ""not abnormal"", as it was not applied only to Bangladesh and several other countries were facing similar immigration-related measures.Ties between Dhaka and New Delhi have remained strained since the Awami League government led by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was ousted in violent, student-led protests in July–August 2024.Relations have since hit another roadblock following the killing of youth leader Sharif Osman Hadi in Dhaka, which triggered anti-India protests. Hadi, a prominent figure in last year's July uprising, was killed amid rising political tensions, sparking widespread unrest.Protests also broke out after the killing of Dipu Chandra Das, a young Hindu factory worker who was lynched in Mymensingh after being falsely accused of religious defamation.Hindu religious organisations and minority rights groups held a protest outside the National Press Club in Dhaka on Monday, describing the incident as part of a wider pattern of religious extremism, attacks on minorities and official inaction.India too raised concerns over the safety of minorities, the security of diplomatic missions and what it calls ""misleading narratives"" emerging from Bangladesh. New Delhi further urged Dhaka to bring those responsible for the lynching of Dipu Chandra Das to justice and said it remained ""vigilant about the safety of minorities.""From exile in India, Sheikh Hasina blamed interim chief adviser Muhammad Yunus for Bangladesh's instability, accusing the interim government of empowering extremists, failing to protect minorities and undermining ties with India.","Bangladesh has asked its key diplomatic missions in India to temporarily suspend visa services.

At one point, Rebecca told Renee to “drive, baby, drive,” after an altercation occurred between them and the agent.The footage then became chaotic, with the camera angle shifting as the ICE agent fell to the ground, followed by gunshots.US vice-president sharing the video in a post on X write, ""Watch this, as hard as it is. Many of you have been told this law enforcement officer wasn't hit by a car, wasn't being harassed, and murdered an innocent woman.

They point to her calm tone and her attempt to drive away as evidence that she was trying to leave the scene, not harm anyone.Several witnesses have also said they did not see Good’s car hit an officer before shots were fired.The US Department of Homeland Security defended the shooting, saying ICE officers were conducting targeted operations when protesters allegedly blocked them.DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said an officer fired “defensive shots” after a vehicle was used as a weapon, describing the act as “domestic terrorism.”President Trump also defended the agent, telling reporters he did not want to see anyone shot but claimed the woman had run over an officer. “She behaved horribly… she ran him over,” Trump said, adding that the situation was “vicious.” After viewing surveillance footage, he described it as “a terrible scene” and said he hated watching it.Also Read | ‘Behaved horribly’: Donald Trump defends ICE agent after Minneapolis shooting; claims 'she ran him over Local leaders disputed the federal account.

UAE restricts scholarships for students to study in UK amid concerns over Islamist radicalisation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-restricts-scholarships-for-students-to-study-in-uk-amid-concerns-over-islamist-radicalisation/articleshow/126432669.cms,"The UAE halted scholarships for UK studies, citing Muslim Brotherhood concerns, sharply reducing Emirati student enrolment/Image: AP

UAE excludes UK universities from scholarship list





The Times UK

Sharp decline in emirati students going to UK





Radicalisation concerns and the Muslim brotherhood





Broader diplomatic strains









The United Arab Emirates has taken a decisive step to limit government funding for emirati students who want to study at British universities, reflecting rising tensions over the UK’s stance on the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood. The move signals deeper strains in a historically close relationship and raises questions about the future of UK-UAE educational ties.According to The Financial Times report, the UAE’s Ministry of Higher Education published a revised list of international universities eligible for state scholarships in June 2025. While institutions in the United States, Australia, France, and Israel were included, British universities were notably absent.Officials told UK representatives that the exclusion was intentional, not an oversight. Sources familiar with the discussions explained that Abu Dhabi’s primary concern was preventing Emirati students from exposure to what it views as potential Islamist radicalisation on UK campuses. A person with direct knowledge said, “They don’t want their kids to be radicalised on campus.” UK officials responded by emphasising the importance of academic freedom.Officials with knowledge of the policy also toldthat federal funding was being limited for citizens hoping to study in the UK, but that the government was not imposing a blanket ban on enrolments. Wealthier families can still send their children to British universities if they cover the costs themselves, while state funding continues to be available for students studying in other countries.The decision comes after federal funding for Emiratis pursuing UK studies had already declined prior to June. Students who had already enrolled in British universities continue to receive support, but the new rules mean that Emirati students starting courses in the UK will face limited or no government funding.The impact has been tangible. In the year ending September 2025, only 213 Emirati students were granted visas to study at UK universities, marking a 27 percent decrease from the previous year and a 55 percent decline from 2022.Beyond scholarship restrictions, the UAE has also stated that qualifications from universities not on the approved list, including most British institutions, will not be recognised domestically. This diminishes the value of UK degrees for Emirati students seeking employment or further study in the UAE.The UAE’s move is closely tied to its long-standing concerns about Islamist movements, particularly the Muslim Brotherhood. Since the Arab uprisings of 2011, Abu Dhabi has imposed strict controls on domestic Islamist activity and sought to limit political Islam regionally. Under President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the UAE has repeatedly questioned the UK’s decision not to proscribe the Brotherhood.Official UK data shows that during the 2023-24 academic year, 70 students at UK universities were referred for possible participation in the government’s Prevent deradicalisation programme for signs of “Islamist radicalisation,” nearly double the previous year, out of a total higher education population of almost three million students. While one UK academic downplayed the scale of Islamist activity on campuses, they noted that events such as the Israel-Gaza conflict have contributed to heightened tensions and protests on campus.The UK government’s 2015 review concluded that the Muslim Brotherhood had not been linked to terrorist activities in or against Britain. Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s administration stated last year that the matter remained under “close review.”Separately, Nigel Farage, leader of the Reform UK party, has pledged to ban the Muslim Brotherhood if he becomes prime minister. The UAE government funded Farage’s visit to the country in 2025.The scholarship restrictions are part of wider strains in UK-UAE relations. Past disagreements have included Abu Dhabi-backed attempts to acquire The Daily Telegraph in November 2023, allegations of UAE support for paramilitary groups in Sudan, which the UAE denies, and a legal dispute in the English Premier League involving Emirati-owned Manchester City football club.Despite these tensions, the UK continues to expand its educational footprint in the UAE. Several British universities, including the University of Manchester and Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, operate campuses in Dubai. Nevertheless, the exclusion of UK institutions from government scholarships highlights the challenges faced by Emirati students seeking to study in the UK.","UAE halts scholarships for UK studies, citing Muslim Brotherhood concerns, sharply reducing Emirati student enrolment. In the year ending September 2025, only 213 Emirati students were granted visas to study at UK universities. Wealthier families can still send their children to British universities if they cover the costs themselves.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126432784,imgsize-818613,width-400,resizemode-4/keir-starmer.jpg"
Iran protests: Is Reza Pahlavi planning to return after 50 years in exile?

Call for strikes and street mobilisation

Message to protesters and security forces

Who is Reza Pahlavi?

Protests grip Iran





Iran’s former Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi on Saturday said that he is preparing to return home. He linked the possible move to the ongoing mass protests against the country’s clerical leadership.Pahlavi, who has lived in exile in the United States for five decades, announced the move in a video message and a post on X, as demonstrations continued across Tehran and other cities.“I, too, am preparing to return to the homeland so that at the time of our national revolution’s victory, I can be beside you, the great nation of Iran. I believe that day is very near,” he wrote.His remarks came amid widespread unrest that has disrupted daily life in parts of Iran and posed one of the most serious challenges to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in years.Many demonstrators have openly called for the return of Pahlavi, the son of Iran’s last shah, who was overthrown during the 1979 Islamic Revolution.In his message, Pahlavi urged Iranians to intensify pressure on the state by targeting the economy and reclaiming public spaces. He called on workers in key sectors to stop work and join the protests.“I call upon the workers and employees of key economic sectors—especially transportation, oil, gas, and energy—to begin the process of nationwide strikes,” he said.Also Read: 1 USD = 1,400,000 IRR: Iran on edge - why this is the most dangerous uprising yet He also appealed for coordinated street action over the weekend, asking people to gather from 6 pm with national symbols and move towards the central areas of cities.“Our goal is no longer merely to be present in the streets; the goal is to prepare for the capture and holding of city centres,” Pahlavi said.Pahlavi praised those who have continued to demonstrate despite threats and crackdowns, describing recent protests as a major blow to the leadership.“My dear compatriots, through your courage and resilience, you have earned the admiration of the world,” he said. Pahlavi added that the protests were “a crushing response to the threats of the treacherous and criminal leader of the Islamic Republic.”He also addressed members of Iran’s armed and security forces who have expressed sympathy with protesters.“To the youth of Iran's Immortal Guard, and all armed and security forces who have joined the national cooperation platform, I say: Slow down and disrupt the repression machine even more so that on the appointed day, we can completely disable it,” he said.Reza Pahlavi was groomed from birth to inherit Iran’s Peacock Throne and was undergoing fighter pilot training in the United States when the 1979 revolution ended his father Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi’s rule.Forced into exile, he has since lived mainly in the US, becoming a symbolic figure for monarchists and some opposition groups, according to BBC.Now 65, Pahlavi said he does not seek to restore the monarchy by force, insisting instead on a peaceful transition and a national referendum to decide Iran’s future system of governance.“This is not about restoring the past. It’s about securing a democratic future for all Iranians,” he has said previously.Iran has been witnessing widespread protests for nearly two weeks, initially triggered by rising living costs but rapidly expanding into broader demonstrations against the clerical establishment.Large crowds have taken to the streets in Tehran and several other cities, chanting slogans against Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.Several human rights groups said that dozens of protesters have been killed and hundreds injured in clashes with security forces.Authorities have responded with a sweeping internet shutdown, which activists say is aimed at limiting the spread of protest footage and masking the scale of the crackdown.The unrest has drawn international attention, with Iran accusing the United States and Israel of inciting instability. Tehran has approached the United Nations Security Council, blaming foreign interference for the escalation of protests into violent acts.",Iran's former Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi says he is preparing to return home.

NEW DELHI: Chief minister Rekha Gupta on Friday said she felt pained that words mistakenly uttered by her were used by AAP members to hurt her dignity, claiming that the opposition cannot tolerate a woman running govt and working round the clock. She also referred to AAP increasingly using memes to take a dig at her.Replying to the discussion on lieutenant governor's address in the assembly, Gupta launched a sharp attack on AAP and its national convener, Arvind Kejriwal , without taking names. ""He consciously swore on his children that he would neither seek power nor accept govt posts, official bungalows or vehicles, and would never ally with Congress. Those misleading statements were made consciously and not by mistake as I did,"" CM said.Referring to Kejriwal's political journey, Gupta claimed that the transition from a hunger strike at Ramlila Maidan to ""Sheesh Mahal"" was undertaken with full awareness.""I am pained by the way AAP functionaries behaved. They do not like a woman running govt or a woman chief minister working 24x7, doing so many things… They are unable to tolerate it. Sometimes they said something to hurt (my) dignity, made cheap comments, levelled baseless allegations and went after my words...They said ‘AQI was uttered as 'AIQ', Gupta said.She added, ""In my speech, I said Congress instead of British, and they started making reels out of it. Anyone can make such verbal slips.""During the debate on pollution, she said two more vehicle fitness centres were opened. ""We started bicycle services at 17 metro stations, three more metro corridors were permitted, and new metro routes are being planned."" The metro, which is 394km, will be taken over 500km, CM underlined. The plan is to develop a public transport culture where people are not ashamed to use public transport instead of a private vehicle, she added.She said, ""You (AAP) make Rs 25-crore smog tower, which doesn't last for a month, and you question us on cloud seeding. Even if it did not succeed, govt tried and should be appreciated.""Delhi Assembly passed Jan Vishwas (Amendment) Bill aimed at decriminalising minor offences. It also passed Court Fees (Delhi Amendment) Bill, 2025, providing for a full refund of court fees in all cases where disputes are settled. Delhi Shops and Establishments (Amendment) Bill allowing women employees to work night shifts also got its nod. AAP MLA Gopal Rai said that slogans and abuses couldn't clean Delhi's air.The former environment minister argued that if BJP govt merely carried forward the work done under Kejriwal, pollution levels would come down. He pointed out that Delhi had progressed from just 109 good air days in 2016 to 209 through sustained governance.","Rekha Gupta said she felt pained that words mistakenly uttered by her were used by AAP members to hurt her dignity.

'I administered medicine through cannula to my wife': Chilling details pour out in Bengaluru doctor murder case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/docs-murder-five-key-evidence-build-case-against-surgeon-husband/articleshow/126456581.cms,"Bengaluru Headlines Today — The Biggest Updates You Need to Know.







BENGALURU: Months after Bengaluru police unravelled the sudden and mysterious death of young doctor Dr Krutika Reddy last year and arrested her husband, surgeon Dr Mahendra Reddy, investigators on Friday filed a voluminous 2,322-page chargesheet before a local court in Bengaluru.As many as 23 doctors have recorded their statements in connection with the murder case. In total, statements of 77 witnesses—including family members, colleagues and friends of the deceased—have been examined by the investigating team, police said.Special public prosecutor P Prasanna Kumar said five major and clinching pieces of evidence strongly establish the prosecution's case against Dr Mahendra Reddy and are likely to lead to his conviction. He credited Marathahalli police inspector Anil Kumar PN and sub-inspector Ravichandra SA for their meticulous efforts in gathering multiple forms of evidence that helped build a strong case.One of the key pieces of evidence is a voluntary statement given by the accused to police. ""I administered medicine through a cannula (intravenous pipe) to my wife on the night of April 23. We slept at midnight. Around 4.30am, I woke up and removed the cannula,"" Dr Mahendra Reddy stated.According to the prosecution, this statement places the accused with the victim during the crucial hours leading up to her death.The prosecutor also said medical evidence revealed traces of propofol anaesthesia in Dr Krutika's body. ""The traces were also found on her legs, indicating that the drug was administered through the legs,"" he said, pointing to clear signs of external administration.Soon after Dr Krutika's death, the accused allegedly opposed a postmortem examination and pressured his father-in-law and others to resist an autopsy, claiming that the body would be cut into pieces. ""Being a doctor, he knew an autopsy would reveal the real cause of death,"" Prasanna Kumar said.The prosecution has also produced circumstantial and electronic evidence showing that Dr Mahendra Reddy himself purchased propofol from a pharmacist. ""He made the payment online using his own mobile phone and his own bank account,"" the prosecutor noted.Additionally, after Dr Krutika's death, the accused allegedly sent messages to a woman friend through a payment app, stating that he had killed his wife for her. When the woman replied that she had not accepted such an act, he allegedly responded that he would remain a killer while she should live happily. ""These messages clearly establish the motive and amount to a confession by the accused,"" Prasanna Kumar said.","Bengaluru police unravelled the sudden and mysterious death of young doctor Dr Krutika Reddy last year.

Man found with 100 human skulls and mummfied bodies in Pennsylvania grave robbery case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/man-found-with-100-human-skulls-and-mummfied-bodies-in-pennsylvania-grave-robbery-case/articleshow/126457952.cms,"Deadly Blast Rocks Pennsylvania; Nursing Home Destroyed As Explosion Causes Multiple Casualties





A man accused of breaking into a historic cemetery near Philadelphia was found with about 100 human skulls, mummified body parts and decomposing torsos, after investigators linked him to a series of grave robberies stretching back weeks, authorities said. The suspect, Jonathan Christ Gerlach, 34, was arrested near Mount Moriah Cemetery, an abandoned burial ground on the city’s outskirts, where at least 26 mausoleums and underground vaults have been forced open since early November.The case came to a head when officers noticed bones and skulls visible inside a vehicle parked near the cemetery, prompting further investigation. Searches of Gerlach’s home in Ephrata and a storage unit uncovered more than 100 human skulls, long bones, mummified hands and feet, and two decomposing torsos, most of them stored in a basement, according to prosecutors.Delaware County District Attorney Tanner Rouse said the remains were in varying conditions. Some were intact, others partially assembled, and some consisted only of skulls placed on shelves. Jewellery believed to have been taken from graves was also recovered, and in at least one instance, a pacemaker was still attached, indicating that not all of the burials were extremely old.Investigators said Gerlach became a suspect after licence-plate data showed his vehicle had repeatedly been near the cemetery during the period of the break-ins.He was arrested as he returned to his car carrying a crowbar and a burlap bag, which authorities say contained mummified remains of two small children, three skulls and additional bones.According to police, Gerlach told investigators he had taken about 30 sets of human remains and showed them some of the graves he allegedly targeted. Authorities said the total number of remains recovered is still being assessed and could be higher.Founded in 1855, Mount Moriah Cemetery spans roughly 160 acres and is believed to contain around 150,000 graves, making it one of the largest abandoned burial grounds in the country. Police say the suspect focused on sealed vaults and mausoleums, damaging stonework to access remains inside.Prosecutors said the motive remains unclear, and they have declined to speculate while the investigation continues. “Given the scale of what we are dealing with, it is difficult at this stage to say exactly why this happened,” Rouse said.Gerlach has been charged with 100 counts each of abuse of a corpse and receiving stolen property, along with multiple counts of burglary, theft, trespassing, and desecration of a historic burial place and venerated objects. He is being held on $1 million bond. Court records do not list an attorney representing him.Authorities said identifying the remains and returning them to their original burial sites is expected to be a lengthy process, given the number involved and the age of many of the graves.","Jonathan Christ Gerlach, 34, was arrested near Mount Moriah Cemetery in Philadelphia.

Naughty But Nice

Barron Watches as Melania and Trump Share an ‘Uncomfortable’ New Year’s Kiss at Mar-a-Lago

CNN 20100429 010000 Larry King Live 4-year old Barron Trump speaks with Slovenian accent





Barron Trump has spent most of his life being watched without ever really being heard. Now 19 and a sophomore at New York University, the youngest son of President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump is, according to people close to the family, quietly working on how he sounds when he speaks.Celebrity journalist Rob Shuter reports that Barron has been taking elocution lessons, training focused on pronunciation and speech clarity, as part of an effort to soften the Slovenian-influenced accent he grew up with. In the Wednesday, January 7 edition of, a source close to the family said the teenager is “very focused on how he presents himself,” adding that he wants to “be confident when he speaks.”Barron’s accent has long been a quiet footnote of his childhood. Raised largely by his mother and her family, he grew up speaking multiple languages and sounded, at times, more European than American. That was on public display when he was four years old and appeared in a pre-recorded segment on Larry King Live. In the clip, a young Barron tells the host, “I like my suitcase,” speaking with a pronounced Slovenian accent. Asked by Larry King whether Barron had an accent, Melania replied, “He does,” explaining that he spent most of his time with her and spoke three languages.When King turned to Trump, the then-businessman answered simply: “I think it’s great. Anything he does is OK with me.”Those early clips resurfaced repeatedly as Barron grew older, including footage of him speaking with a pronounced Slovenian lilt, a reminder of how closely his upbringing was tied to his mother and grandparents. One family friend told Shuter that dynamic has not changed much with age. “Barron was raised primarily by his mother and his grandparents. Even as he grows older, Melania watches over him closely. She wants him to have a normal life, free from cameras and public pressure, while still giving him the tools he needs to succeed. ”People around Barron describe the speech work as deliberate and private, not a performance for public consumption. “Barron is very focused on how he presents himself now,” another source told Shuter. “He’s thoughtful, deliberate, and wants to be confident when he speaks, but he does it quietly, without drawing attention.” A second insider echoed that point, saying, “He stays away from the spotlight whenever possible. He’s very aware of his privacy, and his mother makes sure it stays that way. Melania is fiercely protective of him.”That instinct to stay out of view has followed him into adulthood. Barron is currently attending classes at NYU’s Washington campus while living in the Executive Residence at the White House, a rare arrangement that places him close to power while keeping him largely unseen. According to those who know him, his focus on speech and presentation is part of a broader effort to define himself on his own terms, separate from viral childhood moments and the political gravity surrounding his parents.Elocution lessons, which emphasise clear articulation, breath control and confident delivery, are often used to refine speech rather than erase identity. In Barron’s case, the work appears less about rejecting his roots than about navigating a future in which every word he says is likely to be noticed. For a young man raised between languages, countries and relentless attention, learning how to speak, and when, may be one of the few choices that remains entirely his own.","Barron Trump, 19, has been taking elocution lessons, training focused on pronunciation and speech clarity.

Minnesota BOILS: Tim Walz Confronts Trump, Activates National Guard Amid Anger As ICE Kills American

What was the X post that Jeff Dean quoted

Jesus Freakin Congress' wrote:

🚨BREAKING: Border Patrol just illegally arrested a U.S. citizen… a TEENAGER… in Richfield, Minnesota. The teen was working at Target when agents tackled him and arrested him, while his passport was in his pocket, fully identifying himself as a U.S. citizen.

None of it mattered.

Why? Because he looked Latino.

When a coworker asked who to call, he said, heartbreakingly: “my mom.”

Think about that. Your teenage son goes to work, and Border Patrol kidnaps him.

This isn’t an isolated incident. ICE and Border Patrol have repeatedly illegally arrested U.S. citizens, especially in Minnesota. And after agents murdered a U.S. citizen who tried to drive away from illegal detention, this should outrage every single American.

U.S. citizens do not have to prove their citizenship. Yet, ICE and Border Patrol agents are routinely violating the Constitution, demanding proof anyway… and even refusing to accept drivers licenses or real IDs.

And now? Even a passport doesn’t matter.

This isn’t enforcement… it’s targeting Americans based on fear and appearance, treating citizens like criminals in their own country.

When will this end? When will the government stop stripping citizens of their rights and labeling them terrorists for simply existing?

Controversy over ICE shooting of woman in Minneapolis

Khamenei In BIG TROUBLE: Iran Riots Video Viral Despite Internet Crackdown; BOMBS, Torched Cars...





Iran has been hit with a near‑total nationwide internet blackout amid widespread anti‑government protests, with independent monitors reporting connectivity has fallen to a tiny fraction of normal levels as authorities restrict access across the country. NetBlocks, a global internet monitoring group, confirmed the blackout has persisted for over 36–48 hours, sharply curtailing Iranians’ ability to communicate and share information.Cybersecurity expert noted the shutdown appears to be an intentional, centrally imposed disruption — often described as an “internet kill switch” — rather than a technical failure, and is intended to limit coverage of events on the ground and disrupt protest coordination. The move appears to be aimed at limiting and hiding the flow of information about alleged abuses and crimes by security forces as nationwide protests challenging Iran's theocracy continue. Concerns existed that authorities might attempt to interfere with satellite signals to prevent footage of the unrest from reaching the outside world.According to the Associated Press, at least 116 people have been killed in connection with the nationwide unrest so far.Amnesty International said, ""People in Iran daring to express their anger at decades of repression and demand fundamental change are once again being met with a deadly pattern of security forces unlawfully firing at, chasing, arresting and beating protesters.""Alp Toker, CEO of NetBlocks, was quoted by Fox News as saying, ""This is Iran’s war against its own population using digital means. This was a piecemeal measure that eventually encompassed the entire country, with the government willing to use this kind of measure for an extended period of time.""He added that ""There would be an attempt by the regime to cover up crimes that it may have committed, so this blackout could potentially last for days or weeks.""NetBlocks has described the current blackout as among the most severe ever recorded in Iran. ""We are tracking near-total disconnection of internet service across Iran right now, and connectivity is below 2% of ordinary levels,"" Toker said. ""This is a nationwide disruption that is impacting almost all services, all connectivity and all avenues of life, extending beyond just mobile phones and computers.""The shutdown is affecting essential services, including banks, and severely restricting communication within the country. ""There are a few gaps, so it's possible to communicate with those close to the borders through Wi-Fi or mobile service that crosses borders,"" Toker explained. ""It’s also occasionally possible to find a part in the service, in a fixed-line service, where they can tunnel through all those, but that is increasingly rare and no longer an option. ""Satellite internet, such as Starlink, remains technically feasible but the regime has banned the equipment. ""The technology that the Iranian regime uses to trace links is essentially anti-espionage technology,"" Toker said.He noted that similar measures were imposed during multi-week blackouts in 2019 and 2022, both coinciding with major protests, including those following the killing of Mahsa Amini. ""In past incidents, we did observe that the government attempted to keep a baseline of service available. In this recent case, they pulled the plug, so there’s a far more extreme measure in place here, which suggests that the regime is scared and isn’t taking risks when it comes to the possibility of information reaching the outside world,"" he said.Protests fuelled by a deepening economic crisis have swept Iran since they began on December 28, following the collapse of the Iranian rial, as soaring inflation has driven frustrated traders and university students into the streets of major cities, including Tehran. The unrest, challenging Iran's theocracy, has since intensified. Observers say the demonstrations are the largest since 2022, when the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody sparked nationwide anti-government protests. At least 116 people have been killed in violence linked to the nationwide protests challenging Iran’s theocratic leadership. The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency reported that more than 2,600 people have also been arrested. With internet access restricted and phone lines cut across Iran, assessing the full scale of the demonstrations has become increasingly difficult.",Iran has been hit with a near‑total nationwide internet blackout amid widespread anti‑government protests. Independent monitors report connectivity has fallen to a tiny fraction of normal levels as authorities restrict access across the country. The move appears to be aimed at limiting and hiding the flow of information about alleged abuses and crimes by security forces.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126461430,imgsize-1169890,width-400,resizemode-4/image-2026-01-11t100950914.jpg"

Candace Owens’ SHOCKING Declaration After 4.5-Hour Meeting With Charlie Kirk’s Widow Erika | Watch

Alex Stone calls out Candace Owens theorists amid renewed Charlie Kirk controversy





The fragile calm surrounding one of America’s most polarizing conservative debates has cracked again. One social media comment sparked an old embroiled battle, and caused faith, trust, and loyalty to become the subject of discussion. With the speculation revitalized about the death of Charlie Kirk, there are now public clashes within the conservative movement as to where doubt turns into disrespect.The center of the new tension is Alex Stone whose uncouth message brought a tough line to defend Erika Kirk.His words were aimed squarely at critics fueling conspiracy theories, particularly those aligned with Candace Owens, after she once again questioned Erika Kirk’s account of events tied to her late husband.Stone wrote, “If you are saying that you don't trust Erika Kirk, you are also saying that you don't trust Charlie Kirk. Charlie wasn't dumb. He wasn't naive. He married her and he trusted her. All of these Candace Owens conspiracy theorists should put their phones down and pick up a Bible.”The statement spread quickly, framing the debate as more than a factual dispute. It became a moral challenge.Owens recently revisited doubts about Erika Kirk’s alibi from September 8, just days before Charlie Kirk was shot and killed.Her comments followed what had been described as a ceasefire between the two women after a private meeting late last year. That truce now appears broken.Owens argued that unanswered gaps still linger, including questions about communications and timelines. Erika Kirk, who now leads Turning Point USA, has urged commentators to stop public speculation, warning it could influence the jury in the ongoing case against the accused shooter.Stone’s response reflects a broader frustration within conservative circles. Many see the theories as harmful, not only to a grieving family but to a movement already fractured by internal distrust. Some people say that it is important to be scrutinized even when it is not comfortable.What is very evident is that the rift has ceased to be silent. As the powerful mouths take their sides, the evidence discourse has taken a back seat to ethics. And to a movement that is founded on togetherness and belief, that division can be as difficult to mend as any virtual fight.Also Read: Clavicular accuses Candace Owens’ manager of demanding $30K a month to “PR train” him","Candace Owens reignited controversy surrounding Charlie Kirk’s murder by again questioning the account of his widow, Erika Kirk.

Dan Illouz responds to Candace Owens as supporters push back on Israel Likud remarks





Candace Owens made a strong claim this week that Israel’s ruling Likud party named her and Tucker Carlson as enemies. Her comments came after a speech by Dan Illouz in Israel’s parliament, the Knesset. Candace Owens shared an article from Washington Jewish Week on X and reacted strongly. She wrote, “The Likud party in Israel just named me and Tucker Carlson as enemies that must be fought.” She later added, “These people are murderers. Murderers are threatening me and Tucker Carlson over speech.”Owens also questioned the role of the United States government. She asked, “How is this at all acceptable to our government?” Her post quickly spread online and drew heavy reaction from both supporters and critics.The speech that triggered the backlash happened on Monday. During his address, Illouz warned about what he called harmful ideas coming from the West. He said, “We are used to enemies from outside. We fight terror tunnels of Hamas. We fight the ballistic missiles of Iran. But today I look at the West, our greatest ally, and I see a new enemy rising from within.” He continued, “I am speaking of a poison being sold to the American people as patriotism.I’m speaking of the intellectual vandalism of Tucker Carlson and Candace Owens.”After Owens shared the article, many of her supporters spoke out online. One user asked, “Why are Israeli politicians labeling lawful American citizens who exercise their First Amendment rights as enemies of the state of Israel? Since when did American patriotism become ‘poison’?”Soon after, Dan Illouz responded directly to Owens on X. He wrote, “A quick civics lesson for RealCandaceO: In a democracy, a Member of Parliament speaking is a debate, not ‘the Party.’ This is the freedom America gifted the world.”Illouz also pushed back on the idea that his words were a threat. He said, “This is a civilizational battle of ideas. Any insinuation of violence is just a desperate silencing tactic.” He added that he would respond with “truth and stronger arguments.”The exchange comes as both Candace Owens and Carlson face criticism over past content. Carlson previously hosted Nick Fuentes, a far-right activist known for antisemitic views. Owens has also made sharp comments about Israel in recent months.After the killing of Charlie Kirk, Candace Owens suggested foreign involvement but did not provide proof. The debate remains focused on speech, politics, and rising tension between public figures across countries.Also Read: Candace Owens Raises New Questions About Charlie Kirk After Revealing A Never Before Seen Image With No Visible Blood","Candace Owens made a strong claim this week that Israel’s ruling Likud party named her and Tucker Carlson as enemies.

US role and ongoing mission





The United States carried out “large-scale” retaliatory strikes against Islamic State targets across Syria on Sunday, following last month’s ambush near Palmyra that killed two US soldiers and an American civilian interpreter.US Central Command said the strikes began around 12.30 pm ET and were conducted alongside partner forces, hitting multiple ISIS targets across the country. A US official told CNN that more than 90 precision munitions were fired using more than two dozen aircraft.Saturday’s strikes are part of Operation Hawkeye Strike, the Trump administration’s response to the December attack that killed Sgt. Edgar Brian Torres-Tovar, Sgt. William Nathaniel Howard, and civilian interpreter Ayad Mansoor Sakat while they were supporting Operation Inherent Resolve, the US-led mission to defeat ISIS.US Central Command said the strikes were aimed at preventing future attacks and degrading ISIS’s remaining capabilities in Syria.“The strikes today targeted ISIS throughout Syria as part of our ongoing commitment to root out Islamic terrorism against our warfighters, prevent future attacks, and protect American and partner forces in the region,” the command said in a statement on X.“Our message remains strong: if you harm our warfighters, we will find you and kill you anywhere in the world, no matter how hard you try to evade justice,” US Central Command said.The December ambush marked the first deadly attack on US personnel in Syria since the overthrow of longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad in December 2024. Torres-Tovar, 25, of Des Moines, Iowa, and Howard, 29, of Marshalltown, were members of the Iowa National Guard. Three other Guard members were injured.Operation Hawkeye Strike was launched on December 19 with a large-scale operation that hit roughly 70 ISIS targets across central Syria. The United States and Jordan also carried out a previous round of strikes under the same operation last month.A day before Saturday’s strikes, Syrian officials said their security forces had arrested the military leader of ISIS’s operations in the Levant.Saturday also saw intense clashes in northern Syria’s Aleppo city, where Syrian government forces deployed in the Kurdish-majority Sheikh Maqsoud neighborhood after days of fighting with Kurdish fighters that left dozens dead and wounded.According to Syria’s state news agency SANA, two Kurdish fighters blew themselves up while surrounded by security forces, causing no casualties. Gunfire was reportedly still heard around noon as security forces urged residents to stay indoors. Later in the day, an explosive drone struck the Aleppo Governorate building shortly after a press conference by two Cabinet ministers and a local official.The clashes began Tuesday in Sheikh Maqsoud, Achrafieh, and Bani Zaid after negotiations between the government and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) stalled over integrating Kurdish forces into the national army. Government forces have since taken control of Achrafieh and Bani Zaid. Five days of fighting killed at least 22 people, including civilians on both sides, according to AP.The United States on Saturday called on the Syrian government and Kurdish authorities to return to negotiations, AFP reported. Conflicting reports emerged from Aleppo, with authorities claiming a halt to fighting and the transfer of Kurdish fighters out of the city, which the Kurdish forces denied.The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces have long been the United States’ main partner against ISIS, but since Assad’s ouster, Washington has increasingly coordinated with Syria’s central government in Damascus. Syria recently joined the global coalition against ISIS.Despite President Donald Trump’s skepticism about US involvement in Syria, hundreds of American troops remain deployed as part of Operation Inherent Resolve. In April, the Pentagon announced plans to cut troop levels in half, and in June US envoy Tom Barrack said the United States would eventually reduce its bases in the country to one.",US Central Command said the strikes began around 12.30 pm ET and were conducted alongside partner forces. A US official told CNN that more than 90 precision munitions were fired using more than two dozen aircraft.
