SRINAGAR\JAMMU: Chief minister Omar Abdullah asserted Monday that it would not be possible to end militancy in J&K without people’s support. His comments came amid an ongoing search in Jammu’s Kathua for terrorists who had attacked security forces Sunday, leaving a seven-year-girl injured in the crossfire.“We are making all efforts (to end militancy), although it is not our responsibility directly,” Omar told journalists outside the assembly when asked about the search for terrorists along the Pakistan border in Sanyal area of Kathua’s Hiranagar.Omar pointed out that security and law and order were not under control of the elected govt in J&K after the region became a Union Territory following the 2019 abrogation of special status under Article 370. “The elected govt is making attempts and supporting (Centre-appointed Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha) to keep the situation under control,” the CM said.Asked about a spurt in terror in Kathua, Omar recalled that such attacks had been reported from Rajouri-Poonch belt, too. Late Sunday, forces seized arms, including AK-47s, ammunition and IEDs from a hideout in Sangla Top area of Poonch’s Surankote.Referring to the ongoing operations in Kathua’s Sanyal, Omar said information so far given to him suggested that no contact had been established with the terrorists.A Kathua official put the number of terrorists, reportedly from Jaish-e-Muhammad , at four to five. Teams of army, J&K police and BSF resumed the search early Monday in the rugged terrain. J&K DGP Nalin Prabhat arrived in Sanyal Monday to oversee the operations, bolstered by additional forces, drones, sniffer dogs and elite NSG commandos.The operations had started Sunday evening after a couple, caught by the terrorists, escaped and alerted security forces. The terrorists, who were hiding in the forested patch, opened fire on forces, triggering an encounter. “The exchange of fire stopped last night (Sunday) but the area was cordoned off,” the official said.Anchal Kumari, the girl who suffered splinter injuries, is the daughter of a migrant labourer from Bihar. She was rushed to hospital and is stable, sources said.Anita Devi, the woman caught by the terrorists, said she and husband Ganesh had gone to collect firewood. “They held us hostage but I escaped. The terrorists spoke a mixed local language. Later, my husband also gave them the slip and informed forces,” Anita said.",Chief minister Omar Abdullah says it would not be possible to end militancy in J&K without people's support. His comments came amid an ongoing search in Jammu’s Kathua for terrorists who had attacked security forces Sunday.

They claimed that Congress is providing reservation on the basis of religion which is completely false. BJP is the one which is making laws on the basis of religion.

""Ye Ambedkar ke rakhwaale bante hain (These people claim to be saviours of Ambedkar),"" he said, adding, ""Sardar Patel and Ambedkar had said that reservation in the name of religion will not take place."" Kharge made it clear that ""no such statement was made by the Karnataka minister"".""Nobody talked about changing the Constitution, and no one from our side would talk about changing the Constitution. Such claims are always made from that side,"" Kharge said pointing towards the NDA leaders.His claims were dismissed by BJP president JP Nadda, who said that ""whatever the leader of opposition said is complete lie and false."" He repeated the claim that DKS talked about ""changing Constitution"".""Samvidhan Congress ne diya hai, Samvidhan ko badalne ka kaam bhi Congress karegi,"" he said citing it as DKS's comment.Kharge, in a press brief after Parliament was adjourned, said: ""Congress party and other parties in Karnataka, all together accepted the reservation started in 1994. That reservation has been there since then...continuing till today. But what is their problem? Their problem is that our 5 guarantees are reaching the people in Karnataka and so they are very sad that the popularity of Congress is increasing.""The controversy erupted after Shivakumar, at an event on Sunday, reportedly said that the ""Constitution will be changing"" while discussing a bill granting 4% reservation to minorities and other backward Classes in public contracts.His remarks triggered a political storm, drawing sharp criticism from BJP leaders. Meanwhile, the Karnataka state cabinet has approved an amendment to the Karnataka Transparency in Public Procurement (KTPP) Act, aimed at reserving 4% of tenders for minority contractors.Moreover, the Congress's chief whip in the Rajya Sabha, Jairam Ramesh, on Monday gave a notice of question of breach of privilege against Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju for ""misleading"" the House on alleged statements made Shivakumar. Ramesh gave the notice under Rule 188 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Council of States (Rajya Sabha).","Mallikarjun Kharge says he will take legal action against JP Nadda and Kiren Rijiju.

A national icon’s choices leave fans questioning his allegiance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/has-wayne-gretzky-forgotten-his-canadian-roots-a-national-icons-choices-leave-fans-questioning-his-allegiance/articleshow/119305633.cms,"Image via Getty Images

A missed opportunity at the 4 Nations Face-Off



Does Gretzky still consider Canada home?

Few athletes in the history of sports have been as popular in Canada as Wayne Gretzky . From his early days as a child prodigy in Brantford to being the heart and soul of the Edmonton Oilers dynasty, his path has been one of unprecedented achievement. For decades, he was not just a hockey player—he was a national symbol. But recent developments have left many Canadians asking: has Gretzky moved away from the nation that raised him?The controversy flared again when Wayne Gretzky showed up as Canada's honorary captain during the 4 Nations Face-Off Final. Rather than wearing a red-and-white jersey to symbolize the nation that turned him into a legend, he showed up in a blue suit. More importantly, he took to the ice close to the U.S. bench and gave a thumbs-up to the American players. The symbolic faux pas left many Canadians feeling snubbed. As one sports writer wrote, he was unable to ""read the room.""This is not the first time Wayne Gretzky's Canadian connections have been called into question. His public endorsement of former U.S. President Donald Trump , including trips to Mar-a-Lago, has also raised questions. While personal politics are a private affair, aligning with a divisive figure often has public repercussions. But, as many fans admit, political decisions don't always determine national identity.What hurts more for Canadians is the feeling that Wayne Gretzky has moved away from the nation that raised him. He departed for Los Angeles in 1988, a deal that made him cry and broke the heart of Edmonton. But even then, Canada still owned him. Now, though, instances like the 4 Nations final present a different tale—one in which Gretzky seems more suited to his life in America than his Canadian heritage.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky's daughter Emma Gretzky celebrates boyfriend Stone Eby’s 22nd birthday with heartfelt tribute All it would have required was a little gesture—a red-and-white jersey, a wink at the nation that built him The Great One. But instead, Wayne Gretzky's decision left Canadians asking themselves whether their greatest hockey idol still sees them as his own.","Wayne Gretzky showed up as Canada's honorary captain during the 4 Nations Face- Off Final.

A 21-year old Columbia University student Yunseo Chung, living in the US since the age of seven, has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) attempted to deport her despite her lawful permanent resident status.After Mahmoud Khalil, this is another student who said that the Trump administration has targeted her for deportation over her pro-Palestinian views.The legal documents state that ICE subsequently pursued her, conducting searches at her family residence and university dormitory.""ICE's shocking actions against Chung form part of a larger pattern of attempted U.S. government repression of constitutionally protected protest activity and other forms of speech.

Inside the group chat

Who is Jeffrey Goldberg?

Top Donald Trump administration officials inadvertently included a journalist in a sensitive group on Signal messaging app shortly before launching attacks on Yemen's rebel Houthis.The Atlantic 's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg was added in the classified group just before the US launched military strikes against the Houthis.The classified group chat, named ""Houthi PC small group,"" included high-level discussions about the impending military operation, with National Security Adviser Mike Waltz coordinating the US response to Houthi aggression.According to Goldberg, this Signal group had 18 participants. Besides Waltz, some of the members were individuals who identified themselves as vice president JD Vance, defense secretary Petev Hegseth, secretary of state Marco Rubio, director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, treasury secretary Scott Bessent, CIA director John Ratcliffe, Trump's Middle East and Ukraine envoy Steve Witkoff, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, homeland security adviser Stephen Miller, and others.The leaked messages revealed internal discussions and concerns over the operation’s timing. Vance, writing from Michigan while attending an economic event, expressed skepticism about proceeding with the strikes.""Team, I am out for the day doing an economic event in Michigan. But I think we are making a mistake."" He added, ""I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There's a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices.""According to The Atlantic, Joe Kent, Trump's nominee for the National Counterterrorism Center, supported Vance saying, ""There is nothing time sensitive driving the time line. We'll have the exact same options in a month.""Goldberg said he ""had hours of advance notice"" about the strikes.""I knew two hours before the first bombs exploded that the attack might be coming. The reason I knew this is that Pete Hegseth had texted me the war plan at 11:44 a.m. The plan included precise information about weapons packages, targets, and timing,"" the veteran journalist wrote in a piece on the website.The strikes commenced at approximately 1:45 p.m. Eastern time, with explosions reported across Sanaa, Yemen's capital. Following the operation, officials shared congratulatory messages in the group.National Security Adviser Michael Waltz praised the ""amazing job,"" while CIA Director John Ratcliffe termed it ""A good start."" Other participants, including ""MAR"" (believed to be Marco Rubio), wrote ""Good Job Pete and your team!!"" White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles added, ""Kudos to all – most particularly those in theater and CENTCOM! Really great. God bless.""Goldberg, 65, joined The Atlantic in 2007 as a national correspondent and in 2016 was named the magazine’s 15th editor-in-chief. Under his leadership, The Atlantic won its first-ever Pulitzer Prizes.Previously, Goldberg served as the Middle East correspondent and then the Washington correspondent, for The New Yorker. Beginning his career with The Washington Post's police reporter, he also wrote for The New York Times Magazine, where he did 15 cover stories.An author and a recipient of numerous awards, he has also served in the Israel Defense Forces.","The Atlantic's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg was added in the classified group just before the US launched military strikes against the Houthis.

His detention on Wednesday sparked the largest wave of street demonstrations in Turkiye in more than a decade, deepening concerns over democracy and the rule of law.A total of 1,133 people have been detained since March 19, when the mayor was arrested at his home, interior minister Ali Yerlikaya said. As many as 123 police officers were injured in the protests, he said adding dangerous materials like acid, firebombs and knives were seized.The minister said some of the detained were identified as having ties to groups listed as terrorist organisations.

Mahmoud Khalil: In His Own Words

'Lot of things have changed with the election of Donald Trump'



The Trump administration has found a new ground to seek the deportation of a Syrian-born immigrant with a green card Mahmoud Khalil, who was arrested by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) over his pro-Palestinian protest.The administration alleges Mahmoud Khalil provided inaccurate information on his green card application, rendering him ineligible for US residency.Court documents reveal that the administration claims Khalil omitted details about his extended employment at the British Embassy's Syria Office in Beirut beyond 2022, and his role as a ""political affairs officer"" at the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) from June to November 2023, ABC news reported.The filing states, ""Khalil is now charged as inadmissible at the time of his adjustment of status because he sought to procure an immigration benefit by fraud of willful misrepresentation of a material fact.""The administration further contended that Khalil failed to disclose his membership in the Columbia University Apartheid Divest organisation.Khalil was arrested by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents at his Columbia-owned apartment and later moved to a detention facility in Louisiana, where he now faces deportation.The filing asserts, ""Khalil's First Amendment allegations are a red herring, and there is an independent basis to justify removal sufficient to foreclose Khalil's constitutional claim.""In response, Khalil's attorney Marc Van Der Hout told ABC News, ""The additional charges the government filed last week are completely meritless. They show that the government has no case whatsoever on this bogus charge that his presence in the U.S. would have adverse foreign policy consequences. This case is purely about First Amendment protected activity and speech, and U.S. citizens and permanent residents alike are free to say what they wish about what is going on in the world.""Since 2023, Trump has repeatedly vowed to revoke visas of international students who participate in pro-Palestinian protests and criticize Israel's war efforts.During Monday's State Department briefing, spokesperson Tammy Bruce avoided directly addressing whether UNRWA employment history would disqualify visa applicants, instead stating, ""If you lie in your efforts to come to the United States to get a visa for any reason, or for a green card, maybe there haven't been repercussions, or we haven't done things properly in the past. A lot of things have changed with the election of Donald Trump.""Following his initial arrest, Khalil was moved from his student accommodation to 26 Federal Plaza in Manhattan, then to Elizabeth, New Jersey's immigration facility, before transfer to a Louisiana Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centre, according to his legal representatives.","The administration alleges Mahmoud Khalil provided inaccurate information on his green card application, rendering him ineligible for US residency.

Vanessa Trump, formerly known as Vanessa Haydon, is the ex-wife of Donald Trump Jr. , the eldest son of Donald J. Trump, the 45th and 47th President of the United States. This makes her Donald Trump’s former daughter-in-law.Vanessa and Donald Trump Jr. married in November 2005 at the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida, a property owned by Donald Trump. The wedding was a high-profile event attended by many from the political, social, and business elite, consistent with the Trump family’s media-heavy presence even before Donald Trump’s presidency. During their marriage, Vanessa and Donald Jr. had five children together, making Donald Trump their grandfather.Born Vanessa Kay Haydon, she was a former model and aspiring actress. Raised on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, Vanessa had a relatively privileged upbringing and was known in New York social circles even before her marriage to Donald Trump Jr. She signed with Wilhelmina Models and appeared in various campaigns during her modeling career. She also briefly dabbled in acting, appearing in films like Something's Gotta Give.While married to Donald Jr., Vanessa was often seen at Trump family events and campaign appearances, particularly during Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential run. However, her role was more subdued compared to other Trump family members like Ivanka or Melania. She maintained a low public profile, especially after reports emerged about tensions in her marriage in the mid-2010s.In March 2018, Vanessa Trump filed for divorce from Donald Trump Jr. after nearly 13 years of marriage. The divorce was finalized later that year. In a joint statement, the couple emphasized their continued commitment to co-parenting their five children.Though no longer married into the Trump family, Vanessa has occasionally been in the news, most recently in March 2025 when it was confirmed that she is in a relationship with golf legend Tiger Woods. The news stirred renewed interest in her background and her ties to the Trump family. Some reports suggest that her daughter Kai, an avid young golfer, may have played a role in connecting Vanessa with Woods.Ironically, Vanessa had once briefly dated Donald Trump himself before she was introduced to his son. According to past interviews and reports, she had a few interactions with Donald Trump Sr. in the early 2000s, but the relationship didn’t last. Shortly afterward, she was introduced to Donald Jr. by the elder Trump at a fashion show. That twist of personal history has become more notable with her recent relationship with Tiger Woods, another man famously associated with Donald Trump.Donald Trump’s deep connection to golf also makes the Vanessa-Woods relationship even more interesting. Trump is an avid golfer and owns or operates nearly 20 golf properties around the world. He has frequently played with professional golfers, including Tiger Woods, and has awarded him honors such as the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2019. Woods has played on Trump courses and was seen as a friendly associate of the former president. This new romantic link between Woods and Vanessa Trump places her once again at the intersection of politics, celebrity, and the sport that Trump has long considered central to his brand.","Vanessa Trump, formerly known as Vanessa Haydon, is the ex-wife of Donald Trump Jr., the eldest son of Donald J.

Though Canada has not issued any travel advisory against visiting the United States, Canadian lawmaker Charlie Angus issued a warning against travelling to the US as he claimed that Canadian citizens are being kidnapped by ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) agents. ""We have seen too many stories of citizens being pulled out of airport lines, and being fingerprinted and deported, as if they were criminals. Citizens being kidnapped to illegal detention by ICE…this is not the actions of a Democratic nation,"" New Democratic Party's leader said. While Canada and US have locked horns in a tariff war, the travel warning coincides with the Trump administration's border crackdown.""Canada will never kiss that gangster's ring. We are truth, we are north, we are strong, we are free, we will not bend, and we will not give an inch,"" Angus said in a press conference.Canadian actor Jasmine Mooney who starred in an American Pie video said she was put in chains when she went to renew her visa at the San Ysidro border crossing. She said she was told that she was in the wrong place and that she should have gone to a US consulate. After some to and fro, she was put into ICE custody as she failed to explain to the officers that she was not trying to enter the US illegally. After 12 days of detention, she was finally released and allowed to fly back to Canada.In a massive crackdown on illegal immigrants, the Trump administration has been on an arrest spree. The arrest of two green card holders, Mahmoud Khalil and Badar Khan Suri, created ripples as the administration is planning to deport them.

The only purpose is to demonstrate power over us,"" Egede said. ""His mere presence in Greenland will no doubt fuel American belief in Trump's mission — and the pressure will increase.""The territory has gained international attention due to Trump's annexation plans, particularly given its strategic reserves of rare earth minerals and growing Arctic competition between the US, Russia and China. Trump has consistently advocated for US control despite firm opposition from Denmark and Greenland.""I think we're going to get it one way or the other,"" Trump said during remarks to a joint session of Congress earlier this month.Egede, who advocates for Greenland's independence from Denmark, noted that diplomatic efforts have proven ineffective against Trump's administration's determination to control Greenland.Despite his party's recent electoral defeat, Egede continues as prime minister until a new coalition forms. Likely successor Jens-Frederik Nielsen criticised the timing of the American visit, citing ongoing negotiations and municipal elections.The White House characterised Vance's visit as cultural, focusing on historical sites and the Avannaata Qimussersu dogsled race.

Who is Mahrang Baloch?



Growing Baloch resistance



Challenging the narrative



Balochistan, a region rife with conflict, has become a powder keg as Pakistan confronts a growing insurgency and resistance movement, most recently illustrated with the hijacking of a train by the Balochistan Liberation Army.The shock attack resulted in around 60 deaths and brought to fore the boiling deep-seated tensions between the Baloch people and the Pakistani state.Following the attack, senior Pakistan ministers and army leaders held a special meeting to address the country's worsening security crisis.The Pakistan 'establishment', referring to the army, also turned its eyes towards more legitimate forms of protest.Pakistan police recently detained Mahrang Baloch , a leading human rights advocate and symbol of Baloch aspirations, igniting further unrest.Pakistan views the Baloch movement with increasing alarm, fearing the rise of separatist sentiments and challenges to its authority in the region, particularly because of Balochistan's vast area and crucial borders with hostile countries like Iran and Taliban-led Afghanistan.The arrest of nearly 150 activists, including Mahrang Baloch -- recognised by Time Magazine as one of its 100 Next Emerging Leaders -- has sparked international condemnation and raised concerns about human rights abuses and the suppression of Baloch voices in Pakistan.Pakistani authorities arrested Mahrang on Saturday under charges of terrorism, sedition, and murder after a protest in Balochistan's capital, Quetta, resulted in the deaths of three protesters.Mahrang Baloch, a medical doctor and leader of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC), has been vocal about enforced disappearances and alleged extrajudicial killings in Balochistan.Her sister, Iqra Baloch, condemned her arrest, stating on social media that her visit to Hudda Jail was reminiscent of when she saw her father behind bars 18 years ago. “Back then, Mahrang was by our side. Today, she is not,” she wrote.Mahrang has been a key figure in protests against enforced disappearances. Her father, Abdul Gaffar Langove, a nationalist leader, was forcibly disappeared in 2009, and his body was found three years later in Lasbela district, according to BBC.Since then, she took the decision to fight against enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings. Now, the 32-year-old is continuing activism despite odds thrown at her, which include death threats, travel bans, detention etc.In December 2023, she helped organise a major march to Islamabad calling for action against enforced disappearances, which was met with police crackdowns.Mahrang's family has also alleged that authorities have denied them permission to meet her in jail or deliver food.Support for the Baloch resistance, both violent and non-violent, has been growing, especially among the youth.Many have been radicalised by ongoing human rights abuses in Balochistan, where an anti-insurgency crackdown — dubbed Pakistan's ""secret dirty war"" — has led to thousands of enforced disappearances and killings over two decades.Voice for Baloch Missing Persons reports that since 2009, around 1,500 missing individuals have been found dead, often brutally tortured, while 6,000 remain missing.Human rights groups say extrajudicial killings are rising, but the military denies involvement.Faith in political solutions has also eroded after allegations of military interference in the 2018 and 2024 elections, which sidelined popular Baloch nationalist leaders.Pakistan has been battling a separatist insurgency in Balochistan for years, with militant groups targeting security forces and foreign nationals.Authorities have often pointed towards the terror activities of the BLA to justify brutal crackdown, arrests and torture of Baloch residents.A major part of the Maharang's movement, however, is based on peaceful advocacy, which observers say presents a challenge to the state's narrative.The province, which is also the poorest, accounts for the lion's share of Pakistan’s total landmass but only 6% of its population, has been a site of insurgency and heavy military presence for decades.Activists claim that Islamabad suppresses political voices while exploiting the region's natural resources.Human rights groups argue that her arrest is part of a broader crackdown on Baloch activists. Protests, often led by women, continue in various parts of Balochistan demanding her release.The Pakistani government has not yet responded to calls for transparency regarding the charges against her.The arrest of Mahrang Baloch has scaled-up scrutiny of Pakistan’s policies in Balochistan, with rights groups calling for an independent investigation into the recent protests and the treatment of activists in the region.","Mahrang Baloch, a medical doctor and leader of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC), has been vocal about enforced disappearances and alleged extrajudicial killings in Balochistan.

We are thankful for the many good wishes, prayers and condolences. We are taking some time as a family and will provide information about funeral services and a public celebration of her life in the days to come.""Prior to her death, Love had been receiving treatment for brain cancer . Her daughter had recently disclosed that the treatment was no longer effective for her mother's condition.Mia Love was born to Haitian immigrant parents and died peacefully with her loved ones by her side. She began her political journey in 2003, securing a position on the Saratoga Springs city council, located approximately 30 miles south of Salt Lake City. She subsequently advanced to become the city's mayor.Her initial attempt at a House seat in 2012 resulted in a narrow defeat against Democratic incumbent Jim Matheson in a constituency comprising Salt Lake City suburban areas, NBC news reported.She contested again in 2014, successfully defeating newcomer Doug Owens with a margin of approximately 7,500 votes.Whilst not highlighting her racial background during campaigns, she recognised the historic nature of her 2014 victory. She noted her success challenged those who doubted that a Black, Republican, Mormon woman could secure a congressional seat in predominantly white Utah.The GOP initially viewed her as a promising talent, and she maintained distance from Donald Trump, who faced considerable unpopularity among Utah voters during his presidential campaign leading up to the 2016 election.In 2016, during her re-election campaign and following the emergence of a 2005 recording containing Trump's inappropriate remarks about women, Love opted to skip the Republican National Convention. She issued a statement declaring ""definitively that she would not vote for Trump"". She backed Texas Sen. Ted Cruz instead, though he later withdrew from the race.In her 2018 campaign for a third term, Love attempted to distinguish herself from Trump regarding trade and immigration whilst supporting party positions on tax reduction. Despite Republicans outnumbering Democrats by nearly three-to-one in her district, she lost to Democrat Ben McAdams, former Salt Lake City Mayor, by fewer than 700 votes.Trump specifically mentioned Love during a post-election news conference, while criticising other Republicans who hadn't fully supported him, CBS news reported.""Mia Love gave me no love, and she lost,"" Trump said. ""Too bad. Sorry about that, Mia.""Following her defeat, Love worked as a CNN political commentator and held a fellowship at the University of Sydney.","Mia Love, the former U.S. Representative from Utah, passed away on Sunday.

"Wildfires ravage across Carolinas: Evacuations, emergency and more",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/wildfire-continue-to-burn-north-and-south-carolina-forcing-people-to-flee/articleshow/119449972.cms,"North Carolina

Black Cove fire: Started by a downed power line, this fire has burned 2,076 acres and remains 0% contained as of Sunday.

Deep Woods fire: The largest fire in the county, covering 1,802 acres, is also completely uncontained.

Fish Hook fire: The smallest of the three, this fire has burned 199 acres but is 50% contained.

Emergency measures and safety

South Carolina

Table Rock fire (Pickens county): This fire has expanded to over 1,280 acres, forcing authorities to request voluntary evacuations near Table Rock Mountain. Firefighters have used controlled burns to contain the flames.

Persimmon Ridge fire (Greenville county): This blaze, which ignited on Saturday, has spread to 800 acres despite aerial water drops.

Burning ban and safety measures



Why are these wildfires so intense?

Long road ahead

Firefighters are battling multiple wildfires in North and South Carolina, with rough terrain, strong winds, and dry conditions making containment efforts extremely difficult. The fires, which have already burned thousands of acres, are fueled by debris left behind by Hurricane Helene and an ongoing drought across the region.The North Carolina forest service reported three active wildfires in Polk county, with two major blazes spanning between 1.7 square miles (4.4 square kilometers) and 1.9 square miles (4.9 square kilometers). Fires are also burning in Burke, Madison, and Stokes counties, with Stokes County bordering Virginia.The three major wildfires: Black Cove, Deep Woods, and Fish Hook, continue to spread, forcing evacuations and threatening homes.The Black Clove and Deep Woods fire have each destroyed one home and two structures, officials in Polk County said, quoted by NBC news.At 8.20 pm on Saturday, the North Carolina department of public safety had issued mandatory evacuation orders for parts of the county, located 80 miles (129 kilometers) west of Charlotte. A shelter was also set up in Columbus, North Carolina.Over 165 properties are under mandatory evacuation orders, particularly in areas near the Henderson County line. Local officials have issued voluntary evacuation notices for parts of Laurel Mountain View Road and Boulder View Road as the flames continue to advance.Due to the escalating crisis, North Carolina has issued a statewide burn ban. The North Carolina division of air quality has also declared a “Code Red” air quality alert for Polk County, warning residents to avoid prolonged outdoor exposure. Rutherford county is under a “Code Orange” alert, signalling hazardous air conditions for sensitive groups.Kim Callaway, a Polk county resident near one of the evacuation zones, described the tense situation, “We’ve already actually evacuated everything that we thought that was important.”“And now we’re just staying at the house and trying to do what we can to get our house prepared if the firemen need to show up and hold the line,” Callaway further told WLOS-TV.The fires were burning through timberlands in the Green River Gorge, spreading across steep and difficult terrain on both state-owned and private properties.South Carolina is also struggling with dangerous wildfires, prompting governor Henry McMaster to declare a state of emergency. Two fires in the mountainous region are proving difficult to control:Both the Table Rock and Persimmon Ridge fires were sparked by human activity. While no injuries had been reported and no structures were under immediate threat, voluntary evacuations remained in effect for around 100 homes.The state also obtained a FEMA grant to help cover the costs for additional fire crews, air tankers and other equipment, McMasters said on Monday, USA Today reported.In a statement, the governor said, ""The statewide burning ban remains in effect as wildfire risks remain high across the state.”""Anyone who violates this ban can and will go to jail.""According to the New York Post, the fire that broke out on Sunday morning had spread to approximately 100 acres. The South Carolina National Guard reported that a National Guard air crew had joined efforts to contain the Persimmon Ridge Fire in Greenville, South Carolina.According to Robert Scheller, a forestry professor at North Carolina State University, the devastation left by Hurricane Helene last September has created perfect conditions for these fires.“Helene just dropped tons of fuel on the ground,” he said, “Then these flash droughts allow that fuel to dry out very fast.”This phenomenon was also observed in 2022, when the Bertha Swamp road fire burned 51 square miles of Florida’s timberland, following the path of Hurricane Michael.The North Carolina department of agriculture and consumer services reported that at least 250 firefighters from across the region are battling the flames. The combination of fallen trees, steep terrain, and dry weather is making their job significantly harder.With no significant rainfall in the forecast and high winds continuing to fan the flames, officials warn that the fire season could last for weeks. Residents in affected areas are urged to stay alert, follow evacuation orders, and take precautions against smoke inhalation.","Three major wildfires are burning in Polk County, North Carolina, forcing evacuations and threatening homes.

'Nazis got better treatment': US Judge slams Trump administration on Venezuelan deportations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nazis-got-better-treatment-us-judge-slams-trump-administrations-venezuelan-deportations/articleshow/119449611.cms,"US President Donald Trump

A US federal judge on Monday criticised the Trump administration's expedited deportation of suspected Venezuelan gang members , saying ""Nazis got better treatment"" from the US during World War II.On March 15, President Donald Trump utilised an uncommon wartime legislation, the 1798 Alien Enemies Act (AEA), to transport two aircraft filled with Venezuelan migrants to an El Salvador prison.James Boasberg, chief judge of the US District Court in Washington, issued an immediate restraining order blocking the Trump administration from conducting additional deportation flights under the AEA. The justice department sought to remove the order, and a three-judge US Court of Appeals panel conducted oral arguments on Monday.Justice department attorney Drew Ensign argued that the judge's order significantly interfered with executive branch authority and restricted presidential war and foreign affairs powers.Judge Patricia Millett expressed skepticism, noting the lower court judge questioned only the lack of individual hearings for deportees, not Trump's presidential authority.Legal representatives for several deported Venezuelans stated their clients were not Tren de Aragua (TdA) gang members, had no criminal records, and were targeted primarily because of their tattoos.""Nazis got better treatment under the Alien Enemies Act,"" said Millett, an Obama appointee. ""They had hearing boards before people were removed.""""People on those planes on that Saturday had no opportunity to challenge their removal under the AEA,"" she said. ""Y'all could have picked me up on Saturday and thrown me on a plane thinking I'm a member of Tren de Aragua and given me no chance to protest it.""Judge Justin Walker, appointed by Trump, acknowledged the need for court hearings while appearing more sympathetic to arguments about judicial interference with presidential powers.ACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt told the appeals panel that the Trump administration was employing the AEA to bypass immigration proceedings.","A US federal judge on Monday criticised the Trump administration's expedited deportation of suspected Venezuelan gang members.

JD Vance was against attack on Houthi?



'Only one word for this: FUBAR'



Donald Trump reacts to explosive claim



In a major foot-in-mouth moment for the Donald Trump administration, Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg claimed that he got to know about the plan of US bombing the Houthis two hours before it actually happened because Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth by mistake texted him the war plan.Goldberg detailed how he was added to a Signal group on March 11 by Donald Trump's national security adviser Michael Walz. He wrote that he initially thought somebody was probably masquerading as Waltz trying to trap him. Two days later, Goldberg was added to a Signal chat group called 'Houthi PC small group'.And then the members started sharing the war plans while Goldberg thought it was part of a disinformation campaign to place journalists in embarrassing positions. ""I had very strong doubts that this text group was real, because I could not believe that the national-security leadership of the United States would communicate on Signal about imminent war plans. I also could not believe that the national security adviser to the president would be so reckless as to include the editor in chief of The Atlantic in such discussions with senior U.S. officials, up to and including the vice president,"" he wrote.Goldberg's account then delved into the discussion that unfolded in real time in front of his eye as Vice President JD Vance said, ""I think we are making a mistake.""“3 percent of US trade runs through the suez. 40 percent of European trade does. There is a real risk that the public doesn’t understand this or why it’s necessary. The strongest reason to do this is, as POTUS said, to send a message.”“I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There’s a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.”The revelation by Atlantic created a stir as members of Congress and national security staffers sought to know how this happened. “Only one word for this: FUBAR,” Rep. Pat Ryan (D-N.Y.), an Army veteran who sits on the Armed Services Committee, wrote on X. “If House Republicans won’t hold a hearing on how this happened IMMEDIATELY, I’ll do it my damn self.”“Amateur hour,” Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona (D), a Marine veteran, wrote in a post on X. “These are the geniuses that are also selling out Ukraine and destroying our alliances all around the world. No wonder Putin is embarrassing them at the negotiation table.”Donald Trump said he did not know anything about the controversy but he had no liking for Atlantic. ""I don't know anything about it. I'm not a big fan of The Atlantic. To me, it's a magazine that's going out of business. But I know nothing about it. You're saying that they had what...?"" Trump said.","Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg claimed that he got to know about the plan of US bombing the Houthis two hours before it actually happened.

Vice President JD Vance reacted to the viral audio clip in which he purportedly slammed Elon Musk for his interference in the government, and for making him and President Donald Trump look bad. While AI tools busted the viral audio as fake, JD Vance clarified for once and for all that it was a fake AI-generated clip.""I'm not surprised this guy doesn't have the intelligence to recognize this fact, but I wonder if he has the integrity to delete it now that he knows it's false. If not, it could be defamation. I guess we'll find out!"" Vance posted.JD Vance's statement came in reply to a post of Bishop Talbert Swan who shared the video without mentioning anywhere that it was a fake video. ""The infighting is in full swing. Happy Monday!"" Talbert Swan posted.Before JD Vance reacted, his communications director William Martin dismissed the audio and confirmed that it was most certainly not the vice president. Several social media users deleted the link after it was out in the open that the voice was not JD Vance's though it sounded a lot like his.""Everything that he's doing is getting criticized in the media and he says that he's helping and he's not, he's making us look bad,"" the voice impersonating Vance said adding that Elon Musk is not even an American as he was born in South Africa but is now cos-playing as the great American leader.Elon Musk and JD Vance's relationship has remained volatile with some accounts claiming that initially, Elon Musk did not like JD Vance.

"Colorado Portrait Controversy: 24 posts a day, four hours of sleep....Trump on a social media tear",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/24-posts-a-day-four-hours-of-sleep-trump-on-a-social-media-tear/articleshow/119436756.cms,"File photo: US President Donald Trump (Picture credit: AP)

The TOI Correspondent from Washington:

The President of the United States was up in the middle of the night Sunday agitated about his portrait that Colorado, a Democrat-run state, had put in its legislative building.""Nobody likes a bad picture or painting of themselves, but the one in Colorado, in the State Capitol, put up by the Governor, along with all other Presidents, was purposefully distorted to a level that even I, perhaps, have never seen before,"" he fumed in a 2 a.m social media post.He said that the unnamed artist ""must have lost talent as she got older"" because she had also done a portrait of President Obama before and ""he looks wonderful.""""In any event, I would much prefer not having a picture than having this one, but many people from Colorado have called and written to complain. In fact, they are actually angry about it!""he complained, before concluding that he would be speaking on their behalf to the Radical Left Governor, Jared Polis , ""who is extremely weak on Crime, in particular with respect to Tren de Aragua (a Venezuelan gang), which practically took over Aurora (Don’t worry, we saved it!), to take it down. Jared should be ashamed of himself!""He then moved on to unload on the CBS news program 60 Minutes, which he said is now ""highly discredited"" while wondering why ""it would be doing a total “puff piece” on George Clooney, a second-rate movie “star,” and failed political pundit."" Clooney, he reflected, ""fought hard for Sleepy Joe’s election and then, right after the Debate, dumped him like a dog.""""Later, I assume under orders from the Obama camp, pushed all out for “Kamala,” only to soon realize that that was not going to work out too well…And now George Clooney again? His press agent should be making a fortune!!!"" he mused in the 2 a.m post, before unloading on ""The Failing New York Times"" for ""insisting on using ""Liddle’ Peter Baker, a really bad writer and Obama biographer and sycophant, to write many of the long and boring Fake News hit pieces against me.""""The only two people with less talent than Peter are his “wife,” the lovely Susan Glasser, and, of course, Maggot Hagerman, who may be the least talented writer in the entire stable of New York Times’ MEDIOCRITY!"" Trump said in a familiar putdown of women reporters, willfully distorting Maggie Haberman's name. ""There’s something really wrong with these people, and their SICK, TRUMP DERANGED EDITORS. They did everything within their power to help rig the Election against me. How did that work out???"" he asked triumphantly.Even by his own standards, it was a remarkable feat of venting that many people find puzzling, but his MAGA base finds endearing. Such smackdowns form a core part of his average 24 social media posts per day, mostly on his platform Truth Social where his faithful then relay and celebrate on X, formerly Twitter. Media experts have calculated that he spends anywhere from two to six hours posting on social media and watching news television every day, with a pronounced interest in viewership and ratings given his past role as a tv host.More bemusing is the timing of his posts, many coming late at night or in the week hours, like Sunday night-Monday morning crop. In interviews, Trump has said he needs very little sleep, once telling CNN's Dr Sanjay Gupta he feels great on even 3-4 hours of sleep. He also dictates some social media posts to his aides -- most notably seen when he was watching Kamala Harris during her DNC speech.But last night he was clearly on his own, railing about judges and journalists, actors and activists, in a torrent that stopped for a few hours. In the morning, he announced a 25 per cent tariff on any country that buys oil and gas from Venezuela.","US President Donald Trump was up in the middle of the night Sunday agitated about his portrait that Colorado, a Democrat-run state, had put in its legislative building.

In the All-in podcast, Lutnick revealed that he was certain to work with Elon Musk for planning on how to cut government spending once Donald Trump wins the election. His first meeting was scheduled on October 14 which was a big day for Elon as SpaceX made history by catching a rocket on landing.Revealing the story of their first meeting, Lutnick said he flew down to see Elon Musk with his son, and watched the rocket but then Elon Musk went dark as Elon went to take a nap. ""He was up all night doing the engineering and he went to sleep,"" Lutnick said.After waking up, Elon asked Lutnick to meet him in his house. ""So his house is 1,200 square feet. It's got the furniture in it that I had when I graduated from college. And I am not kidding. It's a 1,200 square feet house and it has plastic chairs,"" Lutnick said.Then they discussed how much they were able to cut. ""I say, I know how to cut 50. And he says I want to cut 80. I said I know how to do 50. He goes, are you with me or against me? I go, I know how to legally do it. What do you have? And my son says it was like two alpha dogs just, like, fighting with each other for the first half hour,"" Lutnick said. And then Musk went to walk his four-year-old son X leaving Lutnick wondering whether the meeting ended and whether it was all good.

SRINAGAR: The bodies of a young Kashmiri man and woman who jumped into the Jhelum near the LoC in Uri on March 5 were returned to their families Saturday after being retrieved from separate spots in the river in PoK. The handover took place at Kaman Post bridge, a crossing point originally built for trade and travel between the two sides of Kashmir.The bridge was opened for the first time since India suspended cross-LoC trade and travel in April 2019, citing concerns that the route was being misused by “Pakistan-based elements for funnelling weapons, narcotics, and fake money”.Though J&K police and disaster response teams had searched extensively, the bodies were found weeks later in PoK — 19-year-old Asiya Bano’s on March 19 and 22-year-old Yassir Hussain Shah’s on March 21. It wasn’t clear why the two natives of Uri in Baramulla district jumped into the Jhelum, which flows from J&K to Pakistan and joins the Chenub, a tributary of the Indus.Following a formal request from India, Pakistani authorities agreed to return the bodies. Senior civil and military officers from both countries, along with medical teams, facilitated the transfer at Kaman Post, about 115km east of Srinagar.“This was a humanitarian effort taken by both nations,” said NC legislator Sajjad Shafi from Uri. “The return of the bodies provides much-needed closure and relief to grieving loved ones.”","The bodies of a young Kashmiri man and woman who jumped into the Jhelum near the LoC in Uri on March 5 were returned to their families Saturday after being retrieved from separate spots in the river in PoK.

A huge repatriation drive

Growing worries about deportations

Calls for international help

Zahra Mousavi, a women's rights activist, fled from Afghanistan to neighboring Pakistan in March 2022 after months of fighting and protesting the oppressive Taliban regime She now lives in hiding and constant fear of being apprehended by the Pakistani police and deported to her home country.Mousavi actively participated in street protests against the Taliban regime after the Islamic fundamentalist group seized power in the war-ravaged country in August 2021.She advocated for women's rights by taking part in public gatherings and demonstrations, and tried to make the voices of Afghan women heard in the rest of the world.But with the Taliban slapping broad restrictions on women and girls and gradually squeezing them out of public life, Mousavi was forced to leave.In Pakistan, however, she has struggled to secure the necessary documents to stay in the country.""I could not obtain a valid Pakistani visa for myself and my family due to high costs and Pakistan's strict visa policies,"" the 29-year-old told DW.""This led to my arrest by Pakistani police on February 22. They entered my home in plain clothes, conducted an intense search, and arrested both me and my young daughter, taking us to a deportation detention camp,"" she said.""We were kept there in extremely harsh conditions for two days and one night, and we were only released after providing guarantees and due to the pressure of human rights activists.""DW spoke to several other Afghan female activists, who are also living in hiding as Islamabad looks to accelerate deportations to Afghanistan.Jamila Ahmadi, 27, said many of her fellow Afghan women had already been sent back to Afghanistan and warned that their lives, as well as hers, were in danger.""My activism, especially my efforts toward women's capacity-building before the Taliban takeover, my reporting on Taliban crimes, and my involvement with the National Directorate of Security (NDS), has placed me in significant danger,"" Ahmadi said.""If I am compelled to return to Taliban rule, it would clearly be a certain death.""Many women's rights activists only sought asylum in Pakistan when the situation became untenable in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan.""In February 2021, I was attacked, resulting in a broken leg, but my determination remained unshaken,"" said Ahmadi.""Again, in September 2021, we were brutally beaten by the Taliban.""Pakistan has hosted millions of Afghan refugees for decades.But over the last three years, Pakistan's relationship with Afghanistan has deteriorated.Islamabad is angry with the Taliban authorities over the operations of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group that formed in 2007 and has conducted numerous attacks on Pakistani security forces.As cross-border tensions escalate, concerns about the well-being of Afghans in Pakistan have increased.Islamabad is currently carrying out a huge drive to repatriate the roughly 4 million Afghans who have crossed the border in the past four decades.Pakistan already repatriated more than 800,000 Afghan refugees between September 2023 and the end of last year, according to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR).Legal experts and refugee rights activists have criticized the Pakistani government's deportation plans, particularly when it comes to deporting Afghan women's rights activists .""Sending activists back to Afghanistan, where they are very likely to be subjected to torture at the hands of the Taliban regime, would put them in greater risk,"" Osama Malik, a refugee lawyer in Islamabad, told DW.Ahmadi said her health had been affected by the deportation drive.""Unfortunately, for more than a month, the Pakistani police have made life difficult for refugees, including issues with visas and visa extensions. My visa expired on February 25, 2025. My personal, psychological and emotional problems are due to not having a visa and being unable to extend it,"" she said.While rights groups have accused the Pakistani authorities of harassing Afghan refugees, Islamabad has denied the allegations and stressed that the removals were part of a 2023 campaign called the ""Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan.""There ""is no specific category for activists among those being deported,"" a Pakistani official, who asked not to be named, told DW. ""The responsibility of hosting Afghan refugees should not fall solely on Pakistan, as other countries can also accommodate them,"" the official added.Qaiser Khan Afridi, spokesperson for the UNHCR in Pakistan, said the agency was worried about the deportations.""UNHCR is especially concerned for Afghans who face a risk of harm upon return, such as ethnic and religious minorities, single women, journalists, human rights activists, and members of artistic professions like musicians.""""In view of these mounting challenges, UNHCR urged Pakistan to continue to provide safety to Afghans at risk, irrespective of their documentation status,"" said Afridi.Maria Noori, a 34-year-old activist from Kabul facing deportation, called on the international community to intervene and save the lives of Afghan female activists living in fear in Pakistan.""Being sent back to Afghanistan would mean facing torture, imprisonment, or even death. The international community must understand that deporting human rights activists, particularly women, is a direct threat to our lives, and immediate action is needed to protect us,"" she told DW.The lawyer Malik criticized Western governments for their inaction.""It is unfortunate that none of the Western countries have stepped up to immediately allow these female activists to travel to their countries,"" he said.Noori explained that the lack of a legal status and residency documents poses a big challenge. ""Additionally, we face harsh economic conditions, unemployment, lack of access to health care and education, and security threats from extremists.",Afghan women's rights activist Zahra Mousavi fled Afghanistan to Pakistan in March 2022.
