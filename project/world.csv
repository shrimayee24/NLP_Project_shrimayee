"Princess Diana: Charles did not like Diana's surprise Billy Joel dance, 'it was early sign of doomed marriage'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/charles-did-not-like-dianas-surprise-billy-joel-dance-it-was-early-sign-of-doomed-marriage/articleshow/113578032.cms,"When Diana told Anne she just wanted to be loved

Princess Diana 's ballet teacher Anne Allan has written a book ' Dancing with Diana ' explaining an early sign of a doomed marriage that she picked up from an incident -- among many other recollections. In December 1985, Diana danced to Billy Joel's ""Uptown Girl"" at the Royal Opera House in London. It was meant to be a surprise for Charles but it became a shock for him as Charles, according to the writer, did not approve of the princess dancing in a slinky gown with no stockings.""She wanted Charles to approve of it,"" Anne told Fox News. Charles' three-word reaction was ""well done, darling"". That's it. Charles immediately went on to doing something else. ""And when you’ve come offstage and your adrenaline is pumping … you just want somebody to tell you that you’re doing all right.""The episode is not unknown. The Season 4 of the Crown on Netflix showed the dance routine and its aftermath.Anne Allan explained that there might be two reasons for Charles' displeasure. One, he's probably not a man who likes surprises; and two, probably he did not like his wife wearing a slinky dress, showing her body. "" I’m not quite sure whether he thought it was the appropriate thing for Her Royal Highness the Princess of Wales.""But all that Diana was hoping was to light spark in their marriage.""She just wanted to bring romance into her life, because that’s what she thought it should be. And I know that they had many, many happy times together. . . . She would arrange a nice night . . . and Charles occasionally would do that, too. But he was probably a bit more pragmatic as a person.""""I think she was much more able to see possibility of how romance should be. I’m not sure if that was how Charles was. She loved holding hands, she loved having a cuddle. She was a very affectionate person. It meant a lot to her to have that in her life.""The performance was kept under the wrap till the last moment.""She just thought it would be great fun not telling Charles,"" said Allan. ""She would just appear, and it would be hugely entertaining, and everybody would maybe have a nice time.""""More than anything, she wanted to support her husband,"" said Allan. ""That’s what mattered to her. She loved him dearly, and she just wanted him to shine. . . . When articles became more and more about her, she just said, ‘I do wish they would spend more time photographing Charles than I. I don’t want to make things difficult.’""Princess Diana and Anne eventually developed a friendship, and Diana would frequently seek Anne's counsel. In the book, Diana is quoted expressing her distress over her husband’s affair, saying, ""I know he's seeing Camilla again. Why doesn't he love me? I just can't understand.""""I have tried everything, tried to conform to his wishes even though I don’t always agree. There’s no affection between us, and I am always on my own. I just want to be loved. I can’t keep going on like this. They are really expecting me to just say nothing and keep going. How do I do that?""""Anne, he runs off to Camilla whenever he can. It’s not at all what I want. I’d like the marriage to work, but it just isn’t for now. Do I just put up with it, hoping he will change?""","Princess Diana's ballet teacher Anne Allan has written a book'Dancing with Diana'In December 1985, Diana danced to Billy Joel's ""Uptown Girl"" at the Royal Opera House in London.

Huge stocks of baby oil, drugs were found at Diddy's sex den while Diddy did not plead guilty to the charges.Usher who once stayed with Diddy said his X account got hacked and that's why all his past posts disappeared. This happened as his old statement in which said he witnessed wild things when he stayed with Diddy resurfaced.Apart from Usher and Pink, Megan Fox deleted all her posts on Instagram and X triggering speculations over how she was linked to Diddy.An old snipped of Khloe Kardashian claiming that she attended one of Diddy's naked parties emerged. ""I got on a plane at 5:30 am. Well this party...I think half the people there were butt naked,"" this is exactly what Khloe said about Diddy's party.Diddy was Justin Bieber's mentor but Bieber's spokesperson said he is trying not to focus on the charges and accusation of Diddy. Justin is in a happy bubble since he became a father.As the list of the Hollywood A-listers becomes long, they are maintaining absolute silence over Diddy's arrest.An officer involved in the raid on Diddy's home compared him to Jeffrey Epstein, stating that Diddy was part of the same social circle as Epstein and Harvey Weinstein. The officer claimed there were 15 years of wild parties, suggesting that while not everyone who attended was complicit in trafficking, they witnessed inappropriate behavior. He emphasized that many people knew what went on, especially as things became more explicit late at night.Also read on the Diddy case:","No Hollywood A-lister has been implicated in the Sean Diddy trafficking case but several 'Diddy lists' are viral.

A chimpanzee recently grabbed an infant from her mother and killed her, sparking outrage in Guinea .The mutilated infant's body was found 3 kilometers from the Nimba Mountains Nature Reserve , a Unesco World Heritage Site . The child's mother, Seny Zogba, told Reuters, ""I was working in a cassava field when a chimpanzee came up from behind, bit me, and pulled my baby into the forest.""Following the incident, residents near a chimpanzee research center in Guinea attacked the facility on Friday.According to the center's managers, the angry crowd destroyed the building and set fire to equipment like drones and computers. They also ransacked over 200 documents.Ecologist Alidjiou Sylla said that food shortages in the reserve are causing chimpanzees to leave the protected area more often, increasing the likelihood of attacks. The research center has documented six chimpanzee attacks on humans in the reserve this year.The forests in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone harbor the critically endangered western chimpanzee. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature , their population decreased by 80% from 1990 to 2014. Only seven western chimpanzees remain in Guinea's Bossou forest, part of the Nimba Mountains Nature Reserve, near local farming communities.In Guinea, chimpanzees are traditionally respected and often given food, which sometimes leads them to human settlements where they may attack, according to Reuters. The Nimba Mountains also contain significant iron ore reserves, raising environmental concerns about the impact of mining on chimpanzees.","The infant's body was found 3 kilometers from the Nimba Mountains Nature Reserve.

'Gaza no longer fit for life': Palestinian President paints grim picture at UN,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/we-will-not-leave-palestinian-president-mahmoud-abbas-demands-un-action-to-end-israel-hamas-war/articleshow/113720420.cms,"Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas (PTI file photo)

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas delivered a forceful plea to the UN General Assembly on Thursday, beginning his speech by declaring three times, ""We will not leave,"" as he called for immediate action to halt the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.""Palestine is our homeland. It is the land of our fathers, our grandfathers. It will remain ours, and if anyone were to leave, it would be the occupying usurpers,"" Mahmoud Abbas said.Abbas warned that Gaza has been almost entirely destroyed and is no longer fit for human life, urging the international community to intervene and end the devastation.""This madness cannot continue. The entire world is responsible for what is happening to our people,"" he said, addressing the 193-member body.Abbas also emphasised that his government would not tolerate any territorial loss, saying, ""We will not allow a single centimeter of Gaza to be taken.""Moreover, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called for Israel's removal from the United Nations, accusing the country of repeatedly defying UN resolutions regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.""Israel, which refuses to implement United Nations resolutions, does not deserve to be a member of this international organisation,"" Abbas said during his address to the UN General Assembly. His remarks follow the UN's earlier recognition of Palestine's eligibility for full membership.The conflict erupted on October 7, 2023, when Hamas militants launched a deadly assault on Israeli communities, killing about 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages back to Gaza, according to Israeli reports.In response, Israel’s military has carried out extensive strikes across Gaza, which Palestinian health authorities claim have killed more than 41,000 people. The assault has displaced almost all of Gaza's 2.3 million residents, leading to severe food shortages, disease outbreaks, and mounting casualties.While countries like the US, Qatar, and Egypt have attempted to mediate a ceasefire and secure the release of hostages, no resolution has been achieved.Abbas called for a complete ceasefire, an end to Israeli settler violence in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, unhindered humanitarian access to Gaza, and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the territory.He also insisted that the Palestinian Authority , under his leadership, should take full control of Gaza, including the management of its borders, particularly the Rafah crossing. He reiterated that elections would be held once peace is restored.In response, Israel's UN Ambassador Danny Danon criticised Abbas for focusing on diplomacy without condemning the Hamas attack that triggered the current war.","Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas delivered a forceful plea to the UN General Assembly on Thursday.

NEW YORK: Pulitzer Prize-winning fiction writer Jhumpa Lahiri has declined to accept an award from the Noguchi Museum in Queens next month in disapproval of its new ban on political dress for its staff, which led to the firings of three employees who had worn kaffiyehs to signal solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza Strip .""Jhumpa Lahiri has chosen to withdraw her acceptance of the 2024 Isamu Noguchi Award in response to our updated dress code policy,"" according to a statement emailed by the museum Wednesday.""We respect her perspective and understand that this policy may or may not align with everyone's views,"" the statement said of Lahiri. ""We remain committed to our core mission of advancing the understanding and appreciation of Isamu Noguchi's art and legacy while upholding our values of inclusivity and openness.""The museum, founded nearly 40 years ago by Noguchi, a Japanese American designer and sculptor, announced last month that during their working hours employees could not wear clothing or accessories that expressed ""political messages, slogans or symbols.""The policy, which does not apply to visitors, was instituted after several staff members had, over a period of months, often worn kaffiyehs -- scarves associated with Palestinians -- for what one fired employee termed ""cultural reasons."" The museum defended the prohibition earlier this month, saying in a statement that ""such expressions can unintentionally alienate segments of our diverse visitorship."" A significant majority of staffers signed a petition opposing the rule.Lahiri and Lee Ufan, a Korean-born minimalist painter, sculptor and poet, were to have received the Isamu Noguchi Award at the museum's fall benefit gala next month. Ufan could not be reached for comment Wednesday but is still scheduled to receive the award, the museum said.Lahiri, who was born in London, won the 2000 Pulitzer for fiction for her debut, the story collection ""Interpreter of Maladies,"" and has since published several books of fiction and nonfiction in English and Italian. She is also the director of the creative writing program at Barnard College. Through her literary agent, Lahiri declined to comment.Questions of how to express solidarity with Israelis or Palestinians have divided cultural institutions since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages. Israel's subsequent invasion of the Gaza Strip has killed more than 41,000 people, according to local health authorities.Lahiri was one of thousands of scholars who signed a letter to university presidents in May expressing solidarity with campus protests against Israel's military campaign in Gaza, calling it ""unspeakable destruction.""The museum's budget is supported by royalties from furniture and lighting designs by Noguchi, who died in 1988. The staff petition alludes to his voluntary internment in an Arizona detention camp for Japanese Americans during World War II in an effort to improve conditions there.","Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Jhumpa Lahiri declines to accept award from Noguchi Museum.

DHAKA: The Bangladesh interim govt’s chief adviser, Prof Muhammad Yunus , has ruled out any chance of him running for election. “No way, that’s not me,” Yunus said, adding that he had no plans to run for office. “Do I look like someone who would run,” he asked while responding to a question during a conversation at the “New York Times Climate Forward Event” on Wednesday.On ousted PM Sheikh Hasina , Yunus said that should be extradited.“Why shouldn’t she be? If she committed crimes, she should be extradited and brought to justice. You are pleading for justice. She too should have to face justice.”Referring to Hasina, law af fairs adviser Asif Nazrul had recently said Bangladesh would definitely seek extradition of any convicted person under its extradition treaty with India. Hasina, who fled Bangladesh on Aug 5, faces several cases.Responding to a question on street justice, Yunus said people abroad are getting exaggerated news and invited journalists to come and write whatever they see with their own eyes. He also said elections should not be too far away as reform initiatives have been taken.","The interim govt’s chief adviser, Prof Muhammad Yunus, has ruled out any chance of him running for election. “Do I look like someone who would run,” he asked while responding to a question during a conversation at the “New York Times Climate Forward Event” on Wednesday.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113720198,imgsize-1312807,width-400,resizemode-4/113720198.jpg"

Trump blasts Zelenskyy

WASHINGTON: The Republican Speaker of the US House of Representatives demanded that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy ""immediately fire"" his ambassador to the United States on Wednesday, a day before Ukraine's leader was due to visit the U.S. Congress.Some Republicans, particularly those closest to former President Donald Trump, have been fuming over Zelenskyy's visit on Sunday to an ammunition plant in President Joe Biden's hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania.Pennsylvania is one of the swing states seen as crucial to victory in the Nov. 5 presidential election.During the trip, Zelenskyy appeared with Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro - who has campaigned for Democratic presidential candidate and Vice President Kamala Harris - Senator Bob Casey and U.S. Representative Matt Cartwright. All are Democrats.""The facility was in a politically contested battleground state, was led by a top political surrogate for Kamala Harris, and failed to include a single Republican because - on purpose - no Republicans were invited,"" wrote Johnson, who is not expected to meet with Zelenskyy when the Ukrainian leader comes to Congress.""The tour was clearly a partisan campaign event designed to help Democrats and is clearly election interference,"" he said.The Ukrainian embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment.Trump has repeatedly criticized the Ukrainian president on the campaign trail this week.""Those cities are gone, they're gone, and we continue to give billions of dollars to a man who refused to make a deal, Zelenskyy. There was no deal that he could have made that wouldn't have been better than the situation you have right now,"" Trump said on Wednesday. ""You have a country that has been obliterated, not possible to be rebuilt.""The former president also blamed Biden and Harris for Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.The Republican-led House Oversight Committee had already announced that it would investigate whether Zelenskyy's trip was an attempt to use a foreign leader to benefit Harris' campaign.It is common practice for governors to meet with foreign leaders who travel to their states. In July, Zelenskyy visited a factory in Utah and was hosted by that state's Republican governor, Spencer Cox.Additionally, a series of foreign leaders, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, have traveled to Florida, in recent months to meet with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago home. Trump won Florida by only 3 percentage points in the 2020 election, and recent polls have shown a close race there between Harris and Trump.On Thursday, Zelenskyy is expected to thank congressional leaders for approving billions of dollars in funding for his country as it grapples with a 2-1/2-year-long Russian invasion, and to make the case for more.After becoming speaker last year, Johnson, who had voted repeatedly against aid for Kyiv, waited until April before allowing the House to vote on Biden's October request for financial assistance for Ukraine.However, he said on Wednesday his letter to Zelenskyy was not a threat to stop funding.""I'm not making any threats,"" he told reporters.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is due to visit the U.S. Congress on Thursday.

Justin Trudeau: Canadian PM Justin Trudeau survives no-confidence vote amid conservative pressure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/canadian-pm-justin-trudeau-survives-no-confidence-vote-amid-conservative-pressure/articleshow/113678502.cms,"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (Photo: Reuters)

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau narrowly survived a vote of no confidence, with 211 lawmakers opposing and 120 in favour, on Wednesday, according to AFP news agency. This vote comes in the wake of heightened scrutiny from the opposition, particularly from Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre , who is eager to capitalise on the political system following the recent collapse of the coalition agreement between the Liberals and the New Democratic Party (NDP).The no-confidence motion was introduced by Poilievre on Tuesday, which followed a debate in Parliament where he criticised Trudeau for failing to address pressing issues such as high living costs, housing crisis, and rising crime rates. “After nine years of Liberal government, the promise of Canada is broken,” said Poilievre noting the doubling of national debt under Trudeau’s leadership. He pledged to implement ""a common sense plan to reduce the tax (on carbon emissions), build homes, fix the budget and stop the crime"" if elected.“People are hurting. People are having trouble paying for groceries, paying for rent, filling up the tank,” said Trudeau on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert acknowledging that many Canadians are “looking at change.” Also, highlighting the challenges Canadians are facing, Trudeau asserted that he remains committed to ""keep fighting"" to improve their situation.Poilievre has vowed to continue pushing for an election, with another attempt to bring down the government expected as early as next week.Despite Poilievre's attempts to unseat Trudeau, other opposition parties have pushed back against his right-wing agenda. Liberal House leader Karina Gould condemned the Conservatives for “playing games,” labelling the no-confidence motion as “pretty lame.”Trudeau, who first came to power in 2015, has previously fended off two of Poilievre’s predecessors in elections in 2019 and 2021. The NDP’s withdrawal from the coalition, intended to maintain government stability until late 2025, has left the Liberals vulnerable. A recent Angus Reid poll shows the Conservatives leading the Liberals by a significant margin, with 43% of voting intentions compared to 21% for the ruling party. Political analysts suggest that an election is unlikely until spring 2025.","Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau narrowly survived a vote of no confidence, with 211 lawmakers opposing and 120 in favour.

Israel has asked its troops to prepare for a ""possible entry"" into Lebanon to ""continue degrading Hezbollah ,” after the Iran-backed organisation targeted Tel Aviv for the first time.However, a Pentagon spokesperson said that an Israeli ground incursion did not appear ""imminent"".Meanwhile, Lebanon's prime minister Najib Mikati told the UN Security Council that Israel was violating its sovereignty and called for an immediate ceasefire.Further, France introduced a proposal for a 21-day ceasefire in Lebanon during UN diplomatic efforts with the United States. The announcement followed discussions at the United Nations between Joe Biden and Emmanuel Macron, and was presented during an emergency Security Council session.US President Joe Biden warned that the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah risks escalating into an ""all-out war"".Meanwhile, France and the US are working on a 21-day ceasefire plan to push for a temporary ceasefire to ease the rising tensions, which have resulted in over 600 fatalities in Lebanon in recent days.""We are counting on both parties to accept it without delay,"" French foreign minister Jean-Noël Barrot told the UN Security Council.An Israeli official revealed that PM Netanyahu has approved the pursuit of a potential deal, contingent upon the return of Israeli civilians to their homes.A Lebanese official described the ongoing efforts as ""very serious"" and, when asked about the potential for a ceasefire, he indicated it was ""not wishful thinking"". He suggested that, if an agreement is reached, it would likely initiate with a four-week ceasefire.After Hezbollah launched missile attacks at Tel Aviv, Israel alerted its troops for a ""possible"" entry into Lebanon to continue its offensive against Hezbollah.""We are attacking all day, both to prepare the ground for the possibility of your entry, but also to continue striking Hezbollah,"" Israeli army chief Herzi Halevi said.It remained unclear whether Halevi was alluding to a ground operation, airstrikes, or another form of retaliation against Hezbollah.Recently, the Israeli military had said that it had no immediate plans for a ground invasion, but Halevi's remarks were the strongest indication yet that troops could be deployed.The Israeli military had shot down a Hezbollah missile targeting Tel Aviv, marking the first instance of the Iranian-backed militia directly aiming at the city.The counter strikes from Israel resulted in at least 51 fatalities and 223 injuries, according to Lebanese health minister Firass Abiad.Since Hezbollah began launching rockets and drones at Israel on October 8 in support of Hamas' earlier attack, approximately 60,000 Israelis have evacuated their homes. Meanwhile, Lebanon's foreign ministry reported that around 500,000 Lebanese have been displaced due to heavy airstrikes by Israeli jets over the past week.","US President Joe Biden warned that the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah risks escalating into an ""all-out war"" France and the US are working on a 21-day ceasefire plan to push for a temporary ceasefire to ease the rising tensions.

Forced confession and fabricated evidence

Fight for justice

Iwao Hakamada, world's longest-serving death row prisoner, was acquitted on Thursday, five decades after being wrongfully convicted of murdering four of a family in 1968, reported CNN.The 88-year-old spent 46 years behind bars before DNA evidence led to his release in 2014, sparking widespread debates over Japan 's criminal justice system , which has been criticised for its heavy reliance on confessions.Hakamada, once a professional boxer, used to work at a soybean processing plant in Shizuoka when his boss and the boss's family were found murdered in 1966.After police interrogation and alleged beatings, Hakamada confessed to the crime but later retracted his statement, claiming his confession had been coerced. Despite this, he was convicted, largely based on bloodstained trousers found in a miso tank, which prosecutors claimed were his.However, years later, new evidence, including DNA tests, revealed that the blood on the trousers did not belong to Hakamada or the victims.The court ruled on Thursday that the clothing, which was key to his conviction, had been planted long after the murders. This admission has raised serious questions about the integrity of Japan’s legal process and its handling of evidence.Hakamada's long fight for exoneration was led by his sister, Hideko , now 91, who has campaigned tirelessly for his release. She highlighted the psychological toll of his time on death row, stating that her brother now lives in his own world, barely recognising reality. His case has become emblematic of the issues within Japan's judicial system, where prosecutors are known to prioritise confessions over concrete evidence.Hakamada awaited execution in solitary confinement for nearly half a century, in a system where death row prisoners are often held in secrecy and executed without prior warning to their families. His case has also intensified calls for the abolition of the death penalty in Japan, the only G7 country, aside from the United States, to retain capital punishment .Hakamada's ordeal has not only exposed the deep flaws in Japan’s legal system but also fuelled ongoing debates about the country's reliance on confessions and its use of the death penalty.Amnesty International and other human rights groups have used Hakamada’s case as a rallying cry for reform, urging Japan to reconsider its judicial practices.","Iwao Hakamada, 88, was convicted of murdering four family members in 1968.

He also expressed confidence that Republicans “will win this election handily”, though he admitted “we’ve a competitive race all the way through November”.In an exclusive interview to Times Now, he highlighted India’s border issues with China and raised New Delhi’s stance on Taiwan.“I think China presents a major threat to both India’s security in the future, as well as the long-term security interests of the US,” he said, adding that “there could be opportunities when we think about production and trade relationships between the US and India, where that could be mutually beneficial to both the US and India and provide greater stability.”On Taiwan, he remarked, “God forbid, if something happens in a China-Taiwan scenario in the future. Knowing where India stands in that situation, I believe, could actually help prevent the conflict if it’s made clear from the outset.”When asked about his Indian-origin and Hindu identity and if it was a hurdle to his aspirations for the top job, he said: “I think people actually reward that authenticity. I think the USA is religiously, racially the most tolerant, and I would say one of the most ambitiously inclusive countries in human history.”Reflecting on his failed presidential bid, Ramaswamy said he was “disappointed” but kept his focus on the learnings.

Some of the more preposterous CIA attempts include exploding cigars, incompetent members of the Mafia, femme non-fatales, and LSD. Alas, Castro kept on giving seven-hour-long speeches and lived to the ripe age of 90.The recent revelations about an Iranian attempt to assassinate Donald Trump read like that laundry list, spearheaded by a Pakistani national named Asif Merchant , who was ostensibly paid a million bucks to off Trump. Merchant, who was no Jackal, was apprehended on his way to the airport. Merchant’s code words involved sartorial code words which included t-shirt (the protest to distract), the flannel shirt (stealing), and fleece jacket (assassination). Despite the clumsiness of the plot, U.S. officials treated it as a serious threat.Iran’s complicated relationship with the US goes back to the time when the US and the UK overthrew Mosaddeq in a coup. There was the Shah of Iran’s ousting, the hostage rescue act that inspired Argo, George Bush’s Axis of Evil speech, Obama’s attempt to normalise relations, and more recently, Trump ordering a drone strike to kill Qasem Soleimani , the commander of the Quds Force who was described as a combination of James Bond and Christina Aguilera. But where does Donald Trump tie into all this? It seems the hate story with Iran started in 1980, the first time the socialite from New York made a public comment about foreign policy when he expressed his horror at the Iran hostage crisis and couldn’t comprehend how a powerful country like the US could allow it. Perhaps the key to understanding Trump’s view of Iran is the Freudian view of how the human brain works.Sigmund Freud’s famous model of brain function involves three entities: the id, ego, and superego. It’s most explained using the chariot analogy: the id is the horse that can run, responsible for our basic urges and desires. The ego is the charioteer, the rational part of our brain, which can guide the horse but can never fully control it. The superego is the charioteer’s father, pointing out his mistakes and guiding him, the part of the brain responsible for criticising and moralising.Trump, on the other hand, appears to be an amalgamation of all three, a fusion of id, ego, and superego, the horse, the charioteer, and the charioteer’s father, where he cannot fathom a world that would question his worldview, and once he became President, America’s worldview. Any disagreement was seen not as a deep criticism of himself and the country he loved and that was now entwined with his psyche. As POTUS, Trump withdrew from theIran Nuclear Deal , citing its inadequacy in addressing Iran’s regional activities and ballistic missile programme. The Trump administration also implemented a “maximum pressure campaign”, targeting vital sectors of Iran’s economy, especially oil and finance, which, to his fury, didn’t secure a new, stricter nuclear deal or change Iran’s behaviour but caused significant hardship in Iran.In January 2020, Trump authorised a drone strike that killed General Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran's Quds Force. This marked a dramatic escalation in US-Iran tensions . Trump justified the strike by claiming that Soleimani was planning attacks on US interests. Trump’s Iran policy appeared to be based on muscle flexing, and in the case of the Soleimani strike, demonstrating how things would go if it wasn’t his way. Iran, understandably used to no dissent on its own turf, viewed Trump as both unpredictable and uncontrollable and seems to have left no stone unturned – barring the ones they keep for stoning women without hijabs – to try and neutralise Trump.While Iran has carried out missile strikes on US bases in Iraq, they also ran a comprehensive disinformation campaign on Trump, including running several ‘liberal’ sound news websites that mocked Trump (opioid-pilled elephant in MAGA China shop) and leaked internal documents about Trump and those close to him, including JD Vance. According to numerous reports, the hackathon is still on.Iran knows that Trump’s return would be rather bad news, who, unlike the Biden administration, hardly pretends he wants to normalise relations. While he might be inclined to do so if a Nobel Peace Prize was on the line, the current id-ego-superego amalgamation prevents him from doing so. Trump’s return portends renewed economic isolation and increased risks of military confrontation, especially over Iran's nuclear advancements.There’s a school of thought that views the October 7 Hamas terrorist attack on Israel as part of Iran’s attempts to destabilise any thawing of relationships between US allies Israel and Saudi Arabia that would have put Tehran on a back foot. Trump’s return would mean that there would be even stauncher backing for Israel in the Middle East. Iran has always viewed all American regimes with staunch distrust, but with Trump, there’s the added complication of not knowing what he will do. Irrespective of who wins the elections, it’s unlikely that the Trump-Iran relationship will meet the same fate as Inspector Captain Louis Renault’s and Rick Blaine’s: It certainly won’t be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.It's fair to say that the Iran regime, even more than Democrats, are worried about a Trump return.","Iran’s complicated relationship with the US goes back to the time when the US and the UK overthrew Mosaddeq in a coup. The first time the socialite from New York made a public comment about foreign policy was in 1980. Trump authorised a drone strike that killed General Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran's Quds Force.

A day after the bodies were found, police found Jones in his wife's house, which sits across the street from Ebeling's home, suffering from severe burns. He was hospitalized for two months before being released and moved to prison.Jones was not present at his trial or conviction, citing lingering effects from the burn injuries he suffered.Jones was linked to the killings and fires through DNA and ballistics evidence, prosecutors said at trial.The defense team for Jones did not deny that he killed the four victims, but argued during his nearly two-week-long trial that he committed the killings during an episode of mental illness he suffered.Prosecutors have said they intend to seek the death penalty , citing several aggravating circumstances - including that Jones committed multiple killings within a short period and that at least two of the killings were carried out to keep the victims from identifying him.Jones' wife, 45-year-old Carrie Jones, is charged with one count of first-degree murder in connection with Gene Twiford's death, as well as counts of tampering with physical evidence and being an accessory to a felony. She's accused of helping her badly burned husband hide while authorities searched for him in the hours after the killings.Her pretrial hearing is set for November 25.","A jury found 44-year-old Jason Jones guilty Thursday of 10 counts, including four counts of first-degree murder.

According to police, the clashes started over a land dispute despite the efforts of the government and tribal elders to calm down the situation.""So far, 36 people have been killed and 80 others injured in clashes during last six days,"" police said.Locals, however, claimed much higher casualty figures.The fighting spread to areas such as Balishkhel, Sadda, Khar Kallay, Peewar and Maqbal in the district, which borders Afghanistan's Khost, Paktia, Logar and Nangarhar provinces, which are considered strongholds of the ISIS and the Pakistan Taliban.In July, at least 50 people were killed and more than 225 injured in week-long clashes between Boshehra and Maleekhel tribes in the same region.A jirga (tribal council) consisting of tribal elders from both sides met with the Deputy Inspector General of Police and Commissioner Kohat to contain the clashes, without much success.The violent clashes entered their sixth consecutive day on Thursday, with fresh exchanges of heavy gunfire across Upper, Lower, and Central tehsils, resulting in six more fatalities and ten injuries.According to police, both sides continue targeting each other with small and large weapons.
