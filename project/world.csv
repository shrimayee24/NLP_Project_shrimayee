‘US Controlled Pak Nuclear Arsenal’: Ex-CIA Agent’s Bombshell, Says ‘Pak Can’t Win Against India’

'Millions of dollars' to Pak intel

'Qaida Plant' & Osama Escape

The US intelligence community believed that India and Pakistan were on the brink of war in 2002, following the Parliament attack (Dec 2001) and the tense military standoff that followed under Operation Parakram, former CIA officer John Kiriakou said. Such was the threat perception that families were evaucated from Islamabad, he added. The State Department at the time was urging restraint on both sides, essentially advising that if a fight were unavoidable it should be kept short and strictly conventional, because the introduction of nuclear weapons would transform the situation for everyone.Even as the CIA in 2002 chanced upon evidence connecting al-Qaida and Lashkar-e-Taiba, the US decided that its relationship with Pakistan ""is bigger than India, Pakistan...we needed the Pakistanis actually more than they needed us at this point"".""...In March of 2002, we raided a Lashkar-e-Taiba safe house in Lahore. And in that house, we captured three Lashkar-e-Taiba fighters who had with them a copy of the al-Qaida training manual. And it was the first time, analytically, that we were able to connect Lashkar-e-Taiba with al-Qaida. I remember receiving a cable from the deputy director of the CIA for intelligence congratulating us on finding this training manual, saying it was the very first time that we could attach the Pakistani govt to al-Qaida,"" he said.Asked about the issue not being highlighted, he said the decision was made at the White House. ""And the decision was that that the relationship is bigger than India, Pakistan. At least temporarily. The relationship, we needed the Pakistanis actually more than they needed us at that point. We were happy to throw money at them. That's what they responded to. But we really needed them to let us base our drones in Balochistan, for example,"" he said.Kiriakou pointed to India's stated posture on nuclear coercion, saying New Delhi has warned it will not tolerate nuclear blackmail and will respond decisively to any terror attack. He highlighted a string of Indian responses to terrorism over recent years, including surgical strikes across Line of Control in 2016, Balakot airstrikes in 2019, and Operation Sindoor in May of this year.American defence contractor funds and cash rewards handed out in Pakistan over decades of counterterrorism cooperation with US enriched some ISI officers, former CIA officer he said. ""I feel that Pakistani groups with an eye towards India benefited because of those American defence contractor monies. Their defence parts were all turned towards India. We paid tens of millions of dollars in cash as rewards to the Pakistani intelligence service. And God knows what they did with that money,"" he said.The former CIA officer also referred Osama bin Laden escaping after CIA had tracked him down soon after 9/11. ""We believed in Oct of 2001 that we had Osama bin Laden and the al-Qaida leadership cornered at Tora Bora. We did not know that the translator for the commander of Central Command was actually an al-Qaida operative who had infiltrated the US military. We told him to come down the mountain. And he said through the translator, can you just give us until dawn? We want to evacuate the women and children and then we'll give up. .. What ended up happening was bin Laden, dressed as a woman, escaped under the cover of darkness in the back of a pickup truck into Pakistan,"" he said.","Former CIA officer John Kiriakou says India and Pakistan were on the brink of war in 2002.

NAGPUR: Red fury has turned inward. The central committee of the banned CPI (Maoist) has lashed out at its own politburo senior Mallojula Venugopal Rao, alias Bhupathi or Sonu, branding him a ""revolutionary traitor"" and ""counter-revolutionary"" for allegedly engineering a ""historic betrayal"" - the mass surrender of 61 Maoist cadres in Maharashtra's Gadchiroli on Oct 15.That surrender, hailed by Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis as the ""beginning of the end"" of Naxalism, saw 50 weapons handed to security forces. In a press release dated Oct 16, the Maoists condemned it as a ""party-breaking act"" that returned ""lethal tools to the enemy"".Bhupathi's public defection has triggered a storm inside the outlawed outfit's top brass. The Maoist central committee, led by its elusive leadership under the pseudonym Abhay, expelled Bhupathi, Vivek (a Dandakaranya special zone committee member), Deepa, and 10 divisional committee members, calling on ""revolutionary masses"" to deliver ""appropriate punishment"".Yet, in a contradictory tone, the committee extended an olive branch to the surrendered cadres: ""We assure them that such people will pose no threat and can return to the party."" It warned Bhupathi and Satish - Dandakaranya commander Rupesh alias Takkalapalli Vasudev Rao, who led another mass surrender of 210 PLGA fighters in Chhattisgarh - to stop ""counter-revolutionary activities"" allegedly carried out under govt intelligence patronage.

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra police on Saturday arrested Prashant Bankar, one of two individuals accused in connection with the suicide of a woman doctor in Phaltan taluka, Satara district.According to news agency ANI, Bankar will be produced in court today. The other accused sub-inspector Gopal Badne, is still absconding.A doctor posted at Phaltan subdistrict hospital was found dead in a hotel room on Thursday evening, officials said.She had checked into the hotel late Wednesday night, as her rented accommodation was far from the hospital.Hotel staff found her body after she failed to respond to repeated knocks.In a note reportedly written on her palm, the doctor accused sub-inspector Gopal Badane of repeated sexual assault and software engineer Prashant Bankar, her landlord’s son, of mental harassment.Satara police have registered a case of abetment of suicide against both.According to a statement the doctor allegedly submitted to an internal inquiry committee, she faced ongoing intimidation and harassment from police officials.She claimed she was pressured to alter post-mortem and medical reports and taunted over prior crimes reported in her home district of Beed.One alleged incident involved police forcing her to declare a high-blood-pressure patient fit for custody and taking the patient away without proper treatment. Despite submitting a written complaint to the deputy superintendent of police in June, she claimed no action was taken.Satara police said the doctor had been in a five-month relationship with Bankar, which later turned sour. Her interactions with the sub-inspector were linked to her hospital duties, as she often conducted medical examinations for suspects in custody. Badane is currently absconding.“We have suspended him and formed a special team to trace and arrest him and the other suspect,” said Inspector General Sunil Phulari.Political leaders have demanded a swift and independent probe. NCP leader Dhananjay Munde called for a special investigation team (SIT) and a fast-track trial, saying ignoring her complaints due to her Beed origin would be a grave injustice. Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Ambadas Danve demanded that officials from outside Satara conduct the inquiry, calling the suicide “a case where protectors turned predators.”Relatives said the doctor had repeatedly complained about police harassment and pressure to alter reports. Activist Nitin Andhale shared her purported statement online, highlighting the alleged inaction and intimidation that may have contributed to her death.Satara superintendent of police Tushar Doshi confirmed that her complaints, including WhatsApp messages, were used to file FIRs under sections 64 (rape) and 108 (abetment of suicide) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.A civil surgeon-led inquiry panel is being set up to determine if hospital authorities acted on her complaints.Civil Surgeon Yuvraj Karape said the doctor had joined the hospital on contract and was nearing the end of her second 11-month term.She often stayed at the hotel after late-night duties, and authorities are examining all complaints regarding alleged police interference in hospital work.","A doctor posted at Phaltan subdistrict hospital was found dead in a hotel room on Thursday evening.

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh Stresses Tri-Services Integration After Operation Sindoor’s Success

NEW DELHI: India is now conducting a major tri-Service combat exercise called “Trishul” on the western front with Pakistan, with a NOTAM (notice to airmen) issued for all aircraft to avoid a vast swathe of airspace along the border in Rajasthan and Gujarat from Oct 30 to Nov 10.Pakistan, too, has issued a notification restricting multiple air traffic routes along its central and southern airspace, though somewhat away from the border, possibly for an exercise or weapons test on Oct 28-29.This muscle-flexing is reminiscent of the multiple NOTAMs issued by both countries in the aftermath of Operation Sindoor during which India conducted deep precision strikes against nine terror hubs as well as 11 airbases and radar sites from May 7 to 10.A senior military officer told TOI that the ongoing wargames are “routine”, in accordance with the practice to conduct a major tri-Service exercise at least once a year. The sheer scale, complexity and area of operations, however, is quite huge. “Multiple joint combat drills, both offensive and defensive in nature, will be executed during Trishul,” an officer said.Moreover, the exercise comes soon after defence minister Rajnath Singh warned Pakistan about its recent military infrastructure build-up near the sensitive Sir Creek region, the 96-km-long tidal estuary between the Rann of Kutch in Gujarat and the Sindh province of Pakistan, which is a major bilateral dispute.“If Pakistan dares to act in the Sir Creek Sector, the reply will be so strong that it will change both history and geography,” he had said.Under the overall Trishul exercise, the armed forces will conduct joint operations across diverse and challenging terrains, including offensive manoeuvres in the creek and desert sectors, amphibious operations off the Saurashtra coast, and joint multi-domain operational drills.The Army has deployed well over 20,000 soldiers with main-battle tanks, howitzers, armed helicopters and different kinds of missile systems. Drills like `Trinetra’ with a focus on “full-cycle electromagnetic spectrum operations and counter-unmanned aerial system kill-chains” are already being conducted by the 21 `Sudarshan Chakra’ strike corps in the desert sector.The IAF, in turn, will soon swing into action with `Mahagujraj” high-tempo operations, with frontline fighters like Rafales and Sukhoi-30MKIs, special aircraft, helicopters, remotely-piloted aircraft and force-enablers like IL-78 mid-air refuellers and airborne early-warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft being deployed from several air bases.The Navy, too, has deployed some frigates and destroyers off the Gujarat coast for the intensive combat manoeuvres. “Remember, the Jamnagar refinery in Gujarat will be a target for Pakistan in any full-scale war,” said the officer.“Different indigenous weapon systems and innovations will be fully tested during the Trishul exercise. In the non-kinetic domains, ISR (intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance), EW (electronic warfare and cyber capabilities will also be a focus area,” the officer said.","India is conducting a major tri-Service combat exercise called ‘Trishul’ on the western front with Pakistan.

NEW DELHI: Back in 2020, when the police and paramilitary forces heavily depended on foreign dog breeds like German Shepherd, Labrador Retriever and Belgian Malinois etc for their dog squads, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had sought to challenge status quo, suggesting the equally agile and more resilient ‘desi’ dog breeds as an ‘atmanirbhar’ alternative.Five years later, the PM will witness the success of his proposed experiment, in person. A contingent made up exclusively of Indian breed dogs like ‘Mudhol Hound’ and ‘Rampur Hound’ — trained by the BSF and now serving as force-multipliers on the eastern and border border, in anti-Naxal operations and narcotics detection — will proudly march in his presence during the Rashtriya Ekta Diwas parade on October 31, at Ekta Nagar in Narmada district of Gujarat.Ekta Nagar is home to Iron Man Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s towering statue, the tallest in the world at 182 metres.This year being the 150th birth centenary of Sardar Patel, the Rashtriya Ekta Diwas celebrations will include a grand parade by the Central armed police forces (CAPFs), including their dog squads, cavalry and camel contingents, and the state police forces. Prime Minister Modi, the guest of honour, will receive the ceremonial salute from the five CRPF Shaurya Chakra awardees as well as the 16 BSF personnel recently honoured with gallantry medals for their valour in Operation Sindoor.Also thrown in are a cultural show featuring grand performances by NCC cadets and school bands; an air show; motorcycle stunts; and tableaux of different states celebrating ‘Unity in Diversity’, BSF DG Daljit Singh Chawdhary shared at a press conference here on Friday.The Guard of Honor to be presented to the PM will be led by a female officer. Women personnel of CISF and CRPF will demonstrate their martial arts and unarmed combat skills.The ‘desi’ breed dogs contingent will be led by female BSF Mudhol Hound ‘Riya’ — conferred the ‘Best Dog’ title at the 2024 All Indian Police Duty meet in Lucknow, after beating 116 foreign breed competitors. Indigenous breeds Rampur Hound and Mudhol Hound will also demonstrate their versatile skills like climbing 18 ft wall and intercepting terrorists or intruders.BSF commandant (veterinary medicine) Sandeep Gupta shared that the force had taken a cue from PM’s ‘Mann ki Baat’ programme and started researching ‘desi’ breeds; they were found better adapted to Indian weather, besides being resilient and agile. “We limited ourselves to studying the parent generation of breeds like Mudhol Hound and Rampur Hound. A breeding programme was started and the second generation was introduced to human socialisation and foundational training. ..it was only with the third generation that we started methodical training,” he said.Chawdhary on Friday said the force has trained 150 Indian breed dogs so far and deployed them “from Thar to Tawang”.","Border Security Force's nearly 40 India-bred dogs- Rampur Hounds and Mudhol Hounds- will participate in the National Unity Day Parade on October 31.

"Collegium preserves judiciary’s autonomy, say CJI B R Gavai, Justice Kant",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/collegium-preserves-judiciarys-autonomy-say-cji-b-r-gavai-justice-kant/articleshow/124772986.cms,"NEW DELHI: CJI B R Gavai and Justice Surya Kant, the next CJI, on Thursday stoutly defended the much-criticised collegium system for selecting constitutional court judges and said it has helped the judiciary preserve its autonomy and independence in administration of justice.CJI Gavai was speaking at Royal Institute of Management in Thimphu, Bhutan, while Justice Kant was addressing Sri Lankan Supreme Court in Colombo. The CJI cited SC’s 2015 judgment striking down the National Judicial Appointments Commission and said granting primary control over judicial appointments to the executive would imperil the independence and autonomy of the judiciary.Justice Kant said the judiciary’s dominant role in appointment of judges to HCs and SC is a compelling “illustration of the doctrine of separation of powers”. The judiciary’s independence and autonomy help it to go beyond simple resolution of disputes or defending constitutional boundaries; it has allowed constitutional courts actively “shape the democratic imagination of a society and to function as architects of democratic life”, he held.Justice Kant said that if separation of powers is the framework of India’s constitutional democracy, then judicial review — Article 32 (a person can approach SC directly over violation of fundamental rights) and Article 226 (a person can file a writ petition in an HC) — is the sustaining force of democracy.The ambit of judicial review extends to constitutional functionaries like EC, Lok Sabha speaker and governors, as well as legislative assemblies. “No act of governance is beyond the purview of judicial oversight,” he stressed.“This expansive power of review is a cornerstone of India’s constitutional democracy and a part of our basic structure, affirming that legality and constitutionality are fundamental preconditions to the exercise of public power,” Justice Kant said.In what reflects the judiciary’s transformative potential to give voice to the voiceless, Justice Kant said, judicial interpretation has resulted in expanding the scope of fundamental rights, leading to legislative action.CJI Gavai said that apart from the broad and purposive interpretation of Article 21 (right to life), SC has consistently held the state accountable for safeguarding and promoting the rights of citizens, compelling govts to translate constitutional guarantees into tangible actions.Public interest litigation (PIL) has evolved as an instrument for protecting human rights and the rights of marginalised and vulnerable communities like bonded labour, undertrial prisoners, migrant workers, manual scavengers, sex workers and pavement dwellers. SC has also brought in electoral reforms by acting on PILs, the CJI said.Justice Kant disagreed with criticism that judicial activism often results in encroachment of the turfs of legislature and executive, and said, “When courts act to empower the powerless, grounded in constitutional text and moral clarity, they do not usurp democracy, they deepen it.”Both the CJI and Justice Kant referred to SC’s landmark 13-judge judgment in the Kesavananda Bharati case in 1973 that established the doctrine of ‘basic structure of the Constitution’. “That judgment transformed the judiciary from a mere interpreter of the Constitution into its guardian,” Justice Kant said.","CJI B R Gavai and Justice Surya Kant, the next CJI, stoutly defended the much- criticised collegium system for selecting constitutional court judges.

Tejashwi formally declared CM face, Sahani named his deputy





Mukesh Sahani: From political exile to deputy CM face





Congress on shaky ground?





The weakest link?





NEW DELHI: The Mahagathbandhan on Thursday announced Tejashwi Yadav as its chief ministerial candidate and Mukesh Sahani as the deputy CM face ahead of the Bihar assembly elections. While Tejashwi’s candidature was widely expected, Sahani’s unexpected rise - from a one-time NDA ally often dismissed by rivals to a key power centre within the alliance has become the defining development, signalling a shift in the coalition’s caste arithmetic and leadership dynamics.Behind the show of unity, however, tensions simmer. As Sahani celebrates his political revival, Congress appears to be the uneasy partner in this new equation. Grassroots dissatisfaction over ticket distribution, coupled with its declining influence in seat-sharing talks, raises questions about whether the grand old party is losing ground within Bihar’s opposition bloc.The Mahagathbandhan formally announced Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader and former deputy chief minister Tejashwi Yadav as its chief ministerial face for the 2025 Bihar Assembly elections. Alongside, Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) chief Mukesh Sahani was declared the alliance’s deputy chief ministerial candidate.The announcement, made during a joint press conference of alliance partners in Patna, ended weeks of speculation over leadership and marked a new phase of coordination within the opposition bloc.Senior Congress leader and election observer Ashok Gehlot said, “All of us sitting here have decided that in these elections, we support Tejashwi Yadav as the CM face.”He confirmed that the Mahagathbandhan would contest the upcoming polls in complete unity, adding that Sahani would serve as Tejashwi’s deputy if the alliance comes to power.Mukesh Sahani’s recent elevation marks a remarkable political comeback. The Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) had originally been part of the Mahagathbandhan, but disagreements over seat-sharing—stemming from the Rashtriya Janata Dal’s reluctance to prioritise smaller allies—led Sahani to exit the coalition. He later joined the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and was allotted 11 seats in the 2020 Bihar elections. Although Sahani lost his own contest, his party managed to win four seats.Sahani was subsequently elected to the Bihar Legislative Council, albeit for a shorter term of one and a half years, which expired in July 2022.Once an NDA ally, Sahani faced political isolation after his fallout with the BJP. His decision to contest against the BJP in both the Bihar Legislative Council and Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections further marginalized him, with several VIP MLAs defecting to the BJP in 2022. In the 2022 Uttar Pradesh elections, Sahani announced plans to field 160 candidates to “oust the incumbent BJP government,” and in Bihar, he fielded 55 candidates against his former ally—but none won. Following these setbacks, a BJP MLA suggested that Sahani’s political chapter in Bihar was over, hinting at his removal as minister and even a potential internal coup within the VIP. Sahani also defied NDA seat-sharing arrangements in the Bihar Legislative Council elections, fielding seven candidates against the BJP once again.In 2025, however, Sahani has staged a political revival, now named the deputy chief ministerial candidate of the opposition bloc.Speaking to reporters in Patna ahead of the announcement, he appeared confident: “Why would I have a problem with anything? Can't you tolerate so much happiness on my face? Mahagathbandhan is moving forward very strongly.”His elevation seems a calculated strategy by the Mahagathbandhan to consolidate Nishad (fishermen) votes and appeal to smaller caste groups that have drifted away from the major alliances. The support base for the Vikassheel Insaan Party consists mainly of the Nishad, Nonia, Bind, Beldar community, which comprises 20 sub-castes of fisherman and boatmen. It also signals social inclusivity — a card the RJD-led bloc has traditionally used effectively in Bihar’s caste-driven politics.While the alliance celebrated unity on stage, discontent brewed within the Congress. In recent weeks, several party workers have expressed anger over the ticket distribution process, alleging bias and manipulation by senior leaders in charge of Bihar affairs.Congress worker Munna Shahi told ANI, “Those whom Rahul Gandhi had entrusted and sent here are from the five-star hotel culture, and they don't like to be brought down to poor ashrams here... We have only one demand, 'ticket chor, gaddi chod'... The selection process has lost its basis. Only eye wash remains now.”After the Congress CEC meeting on Bihar polls, another worker said, “It was said that those people who will be on the screening committee, those who will have their online application will be given tickets. But a few leaders like Krishna Allavaru and Rajesh Ram are making women work hard and go from door to door but cheating them at the end. The promise made by Rahul Gandhi, to honour the youth and women is being broken by Krishna Allavaru. We, the Congress workers, will not stand it. Bihar will not accept it.”Interestingly, on Thursday elevating Congress also replaced Allavaru as Youth Congress chief and brought in Manish Sharma.The internal tensions in the recent weeks by local leaders point to a widening gap between the Congress high command and its state unit. This recurring issue has hurt the party’s performance in multiple states.The Mahagathbandhan’s recalibrated leadership matrix leaves the Congress in an uncomfortable spot. With the RJD holding the chief ministerial claim and the VIP now rewarded with the deputy slot, Congress finds itself without a distinct bargaining chip. Its performance in the 2020 polls, where it contested 70 seats but won only 19, has weakened its ability to negotiate.The current configuration suggests a more RJD-centric alliance, with Tejashwi and Sahani symbolising the blend of legacy and new social representation, while Congress remains peripheral.The joint manifesto of the Mahagathbandhan is set to be released on October 28, after Chhath Puja, with Congress leaders Mallikarjun Kharge and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra expected to join the campaign. However, unless it manages to address internal dissent and project a clear message, Congress could risk further erosion in Bihar’s evolving political narrative.The Bihar assembly elections will be held in two phases on November 6 and 11, with results scheduled for November 14. The Mahagathbandhan — comprising RJD, Congress, CPI, CPI(M), CPI-ML, and Mukesh Sahani’s VIP — faces the NDA alliance led by BJP and JD(U), along with the Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) and HAM(S).",The Mahagathbandhan announced Tejashwi Yadav as its chief ministerial candidate for the 2025 Bihar Assembly elections.

West Bengal Police Arrest Three in Connection with Durgapur Gang-Rape Case





BENGALURU: Bengaluru Rural police have arrested three youths in connection with the alleged gang-rape of a 27-year-old woman near Nelamangala Tuesday night. The survivor, originally from West Bengal, works as a beautician for weddings and other functions and lives with her husband and two sons. Another woman from her hometown and a man from Assam, a friend of her husband, also reside in the adjacent rented house. Her husband was at work when the incident occurred, according to sources.As per the survivor's complaint, five men barged into the house, claiming to be local police, around 9:30pm on Oct 21. ""They accused us of possessing ganja and being involved in a flesh trade, and demanded Rs 1 lakh. They then attacked me and another woman with a cricket bat and a machete. My friend nearly lost consciousness, but I managed to resist. They gagged my younger son and my husband's friend, locking them in the toilet. Three of them dragged me to a room in the adjacent house and raped me. They also robbed Rs 25,000 and two mobile phones,"" the survivor stated in her complaint.Her elder son, who was outside at the time, contacted the police control room. A patrolling Hoysala police vehicle soon arrived at the scene, but the suspects had fled the scene by then.The survivor, who was immediately shifted to a nearby hospital, filed her complaint from her hospital bed. Madanayakanahalli police registered a case of gang-rape under Section 70 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita and launched a manhunt and in less than two days, cops detained a few suspects, including juveniles, for questioning.""By Wednesday night we arrested the accused – Naveen, Kartik, and Glani – and Thursday afternoon, three more suspects—Suyog, Jangli Prithvi, and Seena—were taken into custody. We are still searching for the prime suspect—Mithun, who orchestrated the attack and involved others,"" a senior from Bengaluru Rural police officer said.Preliminary investigations revealed that Mithun, a local resident, had disputes with the survivor. ""The family has been living here for six months. Mithun and the survivor had frequent arguments, and he had threatened to teach her a lesson. That is why he brought his associates, posing as police, to carry out the attack,"" the officer added.Police said while three men allegedly raped the woman, two accused have stated they only beat her and stole cash and phones. Both the survivor and the accused have undergone medical examinations, and the reports are expected to provide further clarity on the incident.",West Bengal Police Arrest Three in Connection with Durgapur Gang-Rape Case.

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi spoke to his Malaysian counterpart Anwar Ibrahim and conveyed that he will virtually attend India-Asean summit Sunday, scotching speculation of a meeting with US President Donald Trump on the margins of Asean and East Asia summits in Kuala Lumpur.The ostensible reason for the rare miss to the summit by Modi might be preoccupation with Bihar assembly elections but it also spares him the discomfiture of running into the mercurial president in the middle of a US-India trade deadlock and growing differences over Pakistan-related issues.According to Ibrahim, Modi told him he would attend virtually “given Deepavali festival was still being celebrated in India at that time”. “I respect the decision and extend my Deepavali greetings to him and all the people of India,” said Ibrahim on X. In his own post on the same platform, Modi congratulated Ibrahim on Malaysia’s Asean chairmanship and conveyed best wishes for the success of upcoming summits.“Look forward to deepening of Asean-India Comprehensive Strategic Partnership,” said Modi. MEA later said in a statement that foreign minister S Jaishankar will represent Modi at East Asia Summit on Oct 27.In their conversation late on Wednesday, Ibrahim said India remains an important partner of Malaysia in trade and investment, technology, education and regional security sectors.Meanwhile, Congress on Thursday said the PM decided against visiting Malaysia to avoid “being cornered by Trump” and asked if this was the reason Modi did not travel to Egypt for Gaza peace summit helmed by Trump a few days back.Congress spokesperson Jairam Ramesh said Modi posting messages in praise of Trump on social media is one thing but to be seen hobnobbing in person with a man who has “claimed 53 times that he stopped Operation Sindoor and has claimed five times that India has promised to stop buying oil from Russia” is another matter which “is far too risky for him”.",The ostensible reason for the rare miss to the summit by Modi might be preoccupation with Bihar assembly elections.

World’s 9 weakest passports in 2025: Countries with the least travel freedom,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/travel/destinations/worlds-9-weakest-passports-in-2025-countries-with-the-least-travel-freedom/articleshow/124721967.cms,"Afghanistan (Rank 104, Score 25)

A passport is an important travel document for those who wish to explore other countries. It allows people international travel freedom. But the ranking of passports also matters. If a country’s passport is strong, the residents can often travel visa free or visa-on-arrival facilities to several nations. But when a country’s passport is weak, it only creates issues in obtaining a visa and also lacks several other powers that come along with strong passports.The rankings are reflection of much deeper and larger issues including political instability, limited diplomatic influence and international relations. These are prime reasons restricting travel freedom for citizens of the affected countries.According to the latest (2025) Henley Passport Index ranking, the passport of Afghanistan is the weakest and grants visa-free access to only 25 countries. On this note, let’s have a look at 9 weakest passports in the world.Afghanistan holds the 104th position on the global passport index, making it the least powerful passport worldwide.Afghan nationals can enter only 25 countries without a visa. This restricted travel freedom stems primarily from ongoing conflict, political instability, and limited diplomatic influence. For the majority of international destinations, Afghan travelers face lengthy and often uncertain visa application procedures, significantly limiting their global mobility.Syria is on number two on the list. Its low ranking is shaped by years of civil war and political instability. Only a few countries grant visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to Syrians. The passport holders also have to face severe entry requirements. Security is the main concern here.Iraq’s passport also offers limited visa-free access. It is because of political instability, security issues, and the country’s changing diplomatic relationships. Iraqi passport holders commonly need to apply for visas in advance.Pakistan has also a low ranking because of its ever-changing political scenario, security, and cross border tensions. Pakistani passport holders often have to go through lengthy visa procedures, their rejection rate is also high.Yemen has a bad security situation, the state of the country is greatly affected by political instability. The passport has limited reach, leaving many destinations off-limits. Humanitarian crises are also there. Outside travel requires careful planning and prior approvals.Somalia’s passport is affected by long-standing political instability. There are security challenges too and a limited diplomatic network. Many countries need Somalis to obtain visas before travel. Progress in governance and expanded bilateral relations is needed.Nepal’s low rank reflects a passport that Nepalis still require visas for many popular destinations. They might enjoy easier travel within South Asia and some neighboring countries, but long-haul travel involves advance visa applications.Palestinian territories also face a lot of issues. There are diplomatic and recognition issues. Passport holders require lengthy full visa processing. Geopolitical constraints and limited state recognition continue to restrict the mobility of many Palestinians.Libya’s passport has slightly higher access, yet remains burdened by political instability and security issues. Libyans frequently face prior-visa requirements and unpredictable processing times. Any sustained improvements in political stability and international relations would likely be the principal route to expand Libyan citizens’ travel freedoms.These nine weak passports of the countries only reflect how security concerns, political instability, cross border tensions, and diplomatic relationships directly affect not only international but everyday freedom to travel. It’s a difficult travel situation for the citizens of these nine nations. With lengthy visa processes and no surety of obtaining one, international mobility is often a matter of careful planning and several official approvals. It also limits work options, education, or family visits abroad, and personal opportunities too.Ultimately, a passport is more than a travel document - it’s a reflection of a nation’s global standing and stability. As countries work toward peace, stronger governance, and better diplomatic ties, their citizens may someday gain the freedom to move across borders with greater ease and dignity.","Afghanistan holds the 104th position on the global passport index, making it the least powerful passport worldwide.

Arturo Gatti Jr’s sister Sofia Gatti — is his death now officially a homicide case across Mexico, Canada, and the US?

Arturo Gatti Sr’s 2009 death also remains surrounded by mystery and doubt

Arturo Gatti Jr has shocked the boxing world after his family claimed his death is now being investigated as a possible homicide. The 17-year-old son of late Canadian boxing legend Arturo Gatti was found dead earlier this month in a Mexico apartment.

'Won't Rely On America': Canada's Big Message To Trump As Tariffs Strain Bilateral Ties

Why Donald Trump is angry with Canada over a Ronald Reagan ad





But is the ad fake?









Ontario premier Doug Ford whose ad campaign is believed to be the reason that rankled US President Donald Trump to the point that he announced the end of trade talks with Canada, reacted to Trump's announcement and shared a full YouTube link to Ronald Reagan's 1987 radio address. In the address, Reagan speaks against tariffs and discuss the importance of free but fair trade.“Canada and the United States are friends, neighbours and allies. President Ronald Reagan knew that we are stronger together. God bless Canada and God bless the United States,” the premier wrote.After a few hours, Ford confirmed that he will pause the ad. ""Our intention was always to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build and the impact of tariffs on workers and businesses. We've achieved our goal, having reached U.S. audiences at the highest levels. I've directed my team to keep putting our message in front of Americans over the weekend so that we can air our commercial during the first two World Series games,"" he said.Doug's government launched the $75 million ad campaign earlier this month using clips of Reagan saying how he dislike tariffs. Trump said the ad was fake and Canada got caught cheating.Trump said Regan loved tariffs for the US and its national security. “TARIFFS ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO THE NATIONAL SECURITY, AND ECONOMY, OF THE U.S.A. Based on their egregious behavior, ALL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CANADA ARE HEREBY TERMINATED,” Trump wrote in a major setback for the Carney government who's trying very hard to come across as a stronger force than Justin Trudeau who was reduced to the status of a 'governor' by Trump.The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute also reacted to the ads, accusing the Ontario government of “using selective audio and video” clips and misrepresenting Reagan’s remarks.“The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute is reviewing its legal options in this matter,” a written statement from the foundation read.Experts have gone through the ad and the actual address of Reagan and found out that the as was not fake but edited.Ford had said earlier that they placed the ad on every major US network so that people get to know what Reagan used to think. “That ad, it’s not a nasty ad,” Ford said. “It’s very factual. And coming from a person like Ronald Reagan, every Republican is going to identify that voice.”'Liberal elbows gone'Opposition leader Pierre Poilievre mocked Carney for his earlier promise to negotiate a win with Trump. ""Mark Carney promised to “negotiate a win” with President Trump and to get a deal by July 21st. Still no deal. Still no win. Liberal elbows gone. US tariffs up.

Trump calls ad 'fake'





US President Donald Trump announced he is imposing an additional 10% tariff on Canadian imports following the airing of a negative television commercial that featured a speech by President Ronald Reagan Officials in the province of Ontario stated that the advertisement will be removed from the airwaves next week. However, Trump declared on his social media platform that because the ad was broadcast during Game 1 of the World Series on Friday night, he is increasing duties on Canadian goods.“Because of their serious misrepresentation of the facts, and hostile act, I am increasing the Tariff on Canada by 10% over and above what they are paying now,” Trump said in his post on the social media platform.Earlier this week, Trump announced that he was halting trade talks with Canada over the advertisement, which was launched earlier this month.An advertisement, purchased by the government of Ontario and broadcast on major US television networks, featured clips from former US President Reagan’s address delivered at Camp David, ahead of his meeting with the prime minister of Japan, CNN reported.This occurred during a period when American sentiments towards Japan were becoming increasingly hostile.In the recent past, Japanese corporations such as Toyota and Sony had entered the American market with high-quality yet affordable cars and electronics, adversely affecting the businesses of prominent American brands including General Motors and RCA.Shortly before his radio address, Reagan imposed higher tariffs on various Japanese products in response to the surge of inexpensive Japanese semiconductors in the US market.Although the advertisement did not include Reagan’s harsh criticisms of Japan, his remarks in the address echoed similar sentiments to those often expressed by Donald Trump regarding trade issues.Watch ad:Shortly before his radio address, Reagan imposed higher tariffs on various Japanese products in response to the surge of inexpensive Japanese semiconductors in the US market.Although the advertisement did not include Reagan’s harsh criticisms of Japan, his remarks in the address echoed similar sentiments to those often expressed by Donald Trump regarding trade issues.“We had clear evidence that Japanese companies were engaging in unfair trade practices that violated an agreement between Japan and the United States,” Reagan stated. “We expect our trading partners to live up to their agreements.”Reagan indicated he would lift the tariffs only upon receiving evidence that Japan was treating American businesses and workers fairly, which appeared to mirror Trump's typical trade statements. However, Reagan made it clear that he was “loath” to impose trade barriers on Japan, acknowledging that high tariffs could harm American workers and the economy.He referenced the Smoot-Hawley tariffs and their role in worsening the Great Depression, a period he and his contemporaries had endured, describing the memory as “deep and searing.”The majority of Reagan’s address, and the segment utilised in the advertisement, explained why advanced economies had largely abandoned tariffs as an economic strategy by the time he assumed the presidency. He highlighted that tariffs increase domestic reliance on government intervention, reduce competition, initiate trade wars leading to more tariffs, inflate prices, and ultimately result in job losses.Trump called the advertisement ""FAKE"" in a Thursday post on X that called off trade negotiations with Canada. It stated that the ad campaign utilised ""selective audio and video of President Ronald Reagan"" and ""misrepresents the Presidential Radio Address.""The foundation did not specify what it believed was misrepresented. In a separate Truth Social post on Monday, Trump incorrectly stated that Reagan supported tariffs.“They fraudulently took a big buy ad saying that Ronald Reagan did not like Tariffs, when actually he LOVED TARIFFS FOR OUR COUNTRY, AND ITS NATIONAL SECURITY,” Trump posted.“Thank you to the Ronald Reagan Foundation for exposing this FRAUD.”The Ronald Reagan Foundation & Institute also claimed the govt of Ontario did not seek permission to use or edit Reagan’s speech, although it is not clear whether it was legally required to. The foundation stated it was reviewing its legal options and encouraged people to watch the unedited speech.","US President Donald Trump announced he is imposing an additional 10% tariff on Canadian imports following the airing of a negative television commercial that featured a speech by President Ronald Reagan.

Despite the mounting tensions, the US president emphasised his goal of securing a “good” deal with China and bringing the trade war to an end.The timing of the Malaysian talks coincided with President Trump’s visit to Kuala Lumpur for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) meeting from October 26 to 28, further highlighting the strategic importance of these discussions.","US trade representative: ""I think we're moving forward to the final details of the type of agreement that the leaders can review and decide if they want to include together"" US President Donald Trump had also expressed believe that the two nations will reach a ""comprehensive deal"" with China's Xi Jinping.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124822159,imgsize-62152,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

US President Donald Trump on Saturday acknowledged that a high-level summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin is unlikely in the near term, even as a senior Kremlin representative met with US officials in Florida to discuss ending the war in Ukraine, reported AFP.“I’m going to have to know that we’re going to make a deal. I’m not going to be wasting my time,” Trump told reporters aboard air force one as he travelled to Asia.“I’ve always had a great relationship with Vladimir Putin, but this has been very disappointing. I thought this would have gotten done before peace in the Middle East,” he added.Trump’s remarks came after plans for a summit in Budapest collapsed, with the president citing lack of sufficient progress in diplomacy. At the same time, Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev was engaged in talks with US officials, signalling that dialogue remains active. According to a Russian source familiar with the discussions, Dmitriev met on Friday and Saturday in Florida with the US special envoy Steve Witkoff.In an interview with CNN, Dmitriev said: “I believe Russia and the US and Ukraine are actually quite close to a diplomatic solution.”He added: “It’s a big move by President Volodymyr Zelensky to already acknowledge that it’s about battle lines.You know, his previous position was that Russia should leave completely - so actually, I think we are reasonably close to a diplomatic solution that can be worked out.”The comments come as the US announced sanctions on two of Russia’s largest oil companies, a move aimed at pressuring Moscow over its war in Ukraine.The European Union launched parallel sanctions on the Russian oil and gas sector. While Putin described the sanctions as “serious” and an “unfriendly act”, he maintained that they would not significantly damage Russia's economy and emphasised ongoing openness to dialogue with the United States.Despite Dmitriev’s optimism, Trump’s insistence on waiting for a concrete deal before meeting Putin suggests summit plans remain conditional.

White House alleges Biden's “War on Cryptocurrency”





Binance founder Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao has expressed his gratitude towards President Donald Trump who pardoned him, essentially erasing the criminal conviction of the cryptocurrency billionaire who served four months in prison for violating US banking laws. Zhao pleaded guilty in November 2023 to violating the Bank Secrecy Act—essentially admitting that Binance failed to implement proper safeguards against money laundering. As part of his plea deal, he agreed to step down as CEO of the exchange he'd founded and led since 2017, pay a $50 million fine, and serve a prison sentence.“Deeply grateful for today’s pardon and to President Trump for upholding America’s commitment to fairness, innovation, and justice,” Zhao said in a post on X (formerly Twitter).“Will do everything we can to help make America the Capital of Crypto and advance web3 worldwide. (Still in flight, more posts to come.) Onwards,” he addedBinance itself also pleaded guilty to charges and paid a record-breaking $4.3 billion in settlements to the US Department of Justice, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and Treasury Department. The exchange also agreed to court-appointed monitoring to ensure compliance with US laws going forward.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt framed the pardon as correcting overreach by the previous administration.“[Zhao] had been prosecuted by the Biden Administration in their war on cryptocurrency,” Leavitt said in a statement.“In their desire to punish the cryptocurrency industry, the Biden Administration pursued Mr. Zhao despite no allegations of fraud or identifiable victims,” she continued, adding, “The Biden Administration sought to imprison Mr. Zhao for three years, a sentence so outside Sentencing Guidelines that even the Judge said he had never heard of this in his 30-year career.”""These actions by the Biden Administration severely damaged the United States' reputation as a global leader in technology and innovation. The Biden Administration's war on crypto is over,” Leavitt concluded.Meanwhile, during a press conference, Trump was asked why he pardoned Zhao. His response suggested he acted on the recommendations of supporters.“I don't know, he was recommended by a lot of people. A lot of people said that he wasn't guilty of anything, he served four months in jail and they say that he was not guilty of anything,"" Trump said.“He was somebody that as I was told—I don't know, I don't believe I've ever met him—but I've been told ... he had a lot of support. They said that what he did is not even a crime, it wasn't a crime, that he was prosecuted by the Biden administration, and so I gave him a pardon at the request of a lot of very good people,” Trump added.","Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao served four months in prison for violating US banking laws.

Sacks' accusations: ‘Regulatory Capture’





Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has defended his artificial intelligence (AI) company against accusations that it’s too “woke” and using fear tactics to shape regulation, firing back at criticism from White House AI czar David Sacks and other Trump administration allies. Amodei insisted that Anthropic shares common ground with the Trump administration on “key areas of AI policy” and pushed back against what he called “a recent uptick in inaccurate claims” about the company's positions.“Despite our track record of communicating frequently and transparently about our positions, there has been a recent uptick in inaccurate claims about Anthropic's policy stances. Some are significant enough that they warrant setting the record straight,” Amodei said in a blog last week.Amodei attempted to bridge the political divide, arguing that Anthropic and the administration ultimately want the same outcomes.“I fully believe that Anthropic, the administration, and leaders across the political spectrum want the same thing: to ensure that powerful AI technology benefits the American people and that America advances and secures its lead in AI development,” he stated.Anthropic – known for its Claude chatbot – has faced criticism in recent weeks over concerns the company has a liberal bias.Anthropic has also reportedly frustrated the Trump administration by barring federal contractors from using its AI tools for certain law enforcement purposes—a policy that conflicts with the administration's law-and-order priorities.White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks has emerged as one of Anthropic's most vocal critics, alleging the company is using fear tactics to manipulate regulation for competitive advantage.“Anthropic is running a sophisticated regulatory capture strategy based on fear-mongering. It is principally responsible for the state regulatory frenzy that is damaging the startup ecosystem,” Sacks wrote on X on October 14.In a post, Sacks alleged that Anthropic wanted to “backdoor Woke AI and other AI regulations through Blue states like California,” suggesting the company is pursuing a state-by-state strategy to impose progressive values on AI development.",Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has defended his artificial intelligence (AI) company against accusations that it’s too “woke” and using fear tactics to shape regulation.

What to expect in Trump-Xi meeting

US President Donald Trump will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping on October 30, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in South Korea, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Thursday, reaffirming the meeting that had been questioned following an escalation in trade tensions.Leavitt informed reporters that Trump departs for Malaysia late on Friday night and will also visit Japan and South Korea. In South Korea, he is scheduled to meet Xi next Thursday after addressing the APEC CEO Summit.""On Thursday morning local time, President Trump will participate in a bilateral meeting with President Xi of the People's Republic of China, before departing to return home,"" Leavitt said.Trump on Thursday (local time) took a tough stance on China's alleged role in smuggling fentanyl into the US via Venezuela.He accused China of using Venezuela as a transit point for fentanyl, evading US and Mexican port controls. Trump, during a press interaction at the White House, stated that the first question he would ask the Chinese leader would be about fentanyl.""I'm meeting with President Xi... The first question I'm going to be asking him about is fentanyl. They make $100 million selling fentanyl into our country. They lose $100 billion with the 20% tariff.So it's not a good business proposition... It's one of the things we're talking about... They pay a very big penalty for doing that... We'll see what happens at the end of next week... I'm meeting with President Xi, actually, in South Korea. ..,"" said Trump.There is a lot at stake, so pressure is building on both leaders Trump and Xi to calm trade tensions that risk damaging the world’s two biggest economies.In this meeting, Trump is expected to crack a deal with Xi as he recently offered to lower tariffs on Chinese exports to the US but insisted that Beijing, too, had to make concessions, including resuming purchases of US soya beans, curbing the flow of ingredients used to make the opioid fentanyl – which has caused an overdose epidemic in America – and lifting restrictions on the export to the US of rare earth minerals, which are needed to manufacture hi-tech products such as smartphones, Guardian reported.Rare-earth stocks continue to be at the top of investors’ minds as the market weighs potential outcomes of a meeting between the leaders of the world’s two largest economies.A failure to reduce trade tensions could further harm US industries that are already grappling with the impact of Trump’s tariffs.The President was optimistic ahead of his meeting with Xi, telling reporters this week: “I think we’re going to end up having a fantastic deal with China … it’s going to be fantastic for the entire world”.Time is of the essence, however, as Trump and Xi’s meeting, yet to be confirmed by Beijing, is scheduled to occur just as additional duties of 100% on Chinese exports to the US are set to take effect.The leaders are also expected to discuss Taiwan, amid concerns that Trump might hesitate in Washington’s support for the democratic, self-governing island under pressure from Xi.Beijing has reportedly requested the White House to declare opposition to Taiwan independence – a move that would please China, which considers Taiwan a renegade province that must be reunified with the mainland.Trade tensions between the United States and China intensified in recent weeks following President Trump's announcement of 100 per cent tariffs on Chinese exports, set to take effect two days after the leaders meet.Trump's pledge followed China's announcement of newly imposed export controls on rare earth metals and related technologies in electronics and military goods.The new US tariffs would be “over and above any tariff” that China is already paying, Trump wrote in a social media post earlier this month. Trump added on Wednesday that his priority is to end Russia's war in Ukraine.Xi “would now like to see that war end,” the president said.

Colombian President Petro Says U.S. Sanctions Won’t Touch Him, Has No U.S. Assets





The United States announced economic sanctions on Colombia's president, Gustavo Petro, on Friday, following Petro's criticism of the Trump administration's military actions in the Caribbean. Washington also said it was sanctioning Petro's wife, a son, and a longtime political ally who is now Colombia's interior minister.The US treasury department, in a news release, said it was sanctioning Petro and his allies because the Colombian leader had allowed drug production to flourish since taking office in 2022.The announcement by the US Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, known as OFAC, freezes any American assets held by sanctioned individuals and blocks American citizens from doing business with them.","The US treasury department, in a news release, said it was sanctioning Petro and his allies because the Colombian leader had allowed drug production to flourish since taking office in 2022.

(AP Photo/Noah Berger)





Mayor Daniel Lurie of San Francisco did what he does best after the Trump administration prepared to send border agents to the Bay Area for a major crackdown on immigration this week. He stayed calm. He worked the phones.He ""power mapped.""In doing so, Lurie and his team visualised concentric circles of prominent business leaders who could persuade President Trump and determined who might lobby the executives to make those important calls. They wanted to deliver the message, in the most diplomatic way possible, that San Francisco was not the apocalyptic landscape that the president sees on Fox News.Soon, a host of billionaires with strong ties to the city were on the phone with Trump and Vice President JD Vance, a former venture capitalist in San Francisco. Lurie, 48, a philanthropist and an heir to the Levi Strauss denim fortune, had never served in elected office until he became San Francisco's mayor in January. To some fellow Democrats, he has been too scripted at a time that has called for brash leadership to counter Trump.Some have also resented his connections with tech billionaires.But Lurie's supporters say his approach was simply an extension of his quiet leadership and his ability to work the levers behind the scenes in ways that few others can.He leaned on Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI and a resident of the city's Russian Hill neighborhood, who served on the mayor's transition team before his inauguration. He relied on Marc Benioff, the Salesforce CEO who was eager to move past his viral comments calling on Trump to send the National Guard to San Francisco - words he later recanted and apologised for.He received help from Jensen Huang, the CEO of the chipmaker Nvidia and the owner of a mansion on San Francisco's Billionaire's Row. Ron Conway, the VC known as the Godfather of Silicon Valley, also lobbied behind the scenes. He called Republicans he thought could persuade Trump to back off. Lurie wanted the intermediaries to be factual, persuasive, private and totally noncombative.Trump called Lurie late Wednesday night, and by the end of the conversation, he had agreed to call off the surge in San Francisco that he had planned for Saturday, according to his post on Truth Social. Trump also said the tech leaders had vouched for the mayor's efforts to increase public safety in San Francisco.""I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance,"" Trump posted on Truth Social Thursday morning. ""The people of San Francisco have come together on fighting Crime, especially since we began to take charge of that very nasty subject.""

Focus shifts to Asia and China talks





Malaysia, Japan and North Korea on the agenda





Trade, peace and the search for legacy









US President Donald Trump met Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani on Saturday during a refuelling stop at Al Udeid Air Base, a key US military hub, to discuss the fragile Gaza ceasefire.The meeting came as Israel conducted an air strike on an alleged Islamic Jihad militant in Gaza, testing the truce brokered by Washington.“What we’ve done is incredible peace to the Middle East, and they were a very big factor in it,” Trump said, praising Qatar’s role in the ceasefire deal. The Qatari leaders boarded Air Force One for talks with Trump and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who recently returned from Israel as part of Washington’s diplomatic efforts to keep the Gaza peace process on track.Qatar, along with Egypt, the United States and Turkey, is a guarantor of the Gaza truce and has been central to indirect talks between Israel and Hamas since the conflict erupted following Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attack on Israel. The Emir also hosted Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan earlier this week to discuss plans for a Gaza security force and the future of Hamas’s political structure.Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform after the talks: “Let’s see what they do over the next 48 hours.I am watching this very closely.” The US president said Qatar’s prime minister had been his “friend to the world” and praised Doha’s “big factor” role in maintaining peace in the Middle East.Following his Qatar stop, Trump embarked on his first Asia tour since returning to office in January, a trip that includes visits to Malaysia, Japan and South Korea. He is expected to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday in South Korea, in what could be a decisive moment for ending the prolonged trade war between Washington and Beijing.Aboard Air Force One, Trump said, “I think we have a really good chance of making a really comprehensive deal.” Such an agreement could prevent the imposition of 100 percent tariffs on Chinese goods set to take effect on November 1. He added that he would also raise the issue of fentanyl trafficking with Xi, pushing Beijing to act against the flow of the deadly synthetic opioid into the US.The highlight of the trip will be Trump’s participation in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Busan, South Korea. He will also meet South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and address a luncheon of business leaders, followed by dinner with American technology executives in Gyeongju.Trump’s first stop on the trip will be Malaysia, where he is set to attend the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit on Sunday. The visit marks his return to the summit after multiple absences during his first term. He is expected to sign a trade pact with Malaysia and witness the signing of a peace accord between Thailand and Cambodia, continuing his pursuit of what he has called “a new era of global peace. ”On the sidelines of the ASEAN summit, Trump plans to meet Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to “reset ties” after months of strained relations.In Tokyo, Trump will meet Japan’s first female prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, a conservative who said she had a “good and candid” initial conversation with the US president. Japan, unlike many other countries, has largely avoided Trump’s punitive tariffs on global trade.Ahead of his Asia tour, Trump also reignited speculation that he could meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for the first time since 2019. “I’m open to it,” Trump said when asked about the possibility. When pressed on whether he would accept North Korea’s demand for recognition as a nuclear power, he replied: “Well, I think they are sort of a nuclear power... They got a lot of nuclear weapons, I’ll say that.”Kim has expressed willingness to meet again if Washington drops its demand that Pyongyang dismantle its nuclear arsenal. Trump’s aides, however, have downplayed the chances of a formal summit, saying it would depend on “constructive signals” from Pyongyang.Trump’s multi-nation tour, his first major foreign engagement since retaking the White House, is viewed as an attempt to project renewed American leadership abroad while balancing his dual goals of achieving peace in the Middle East and securing an economic win against China.US officials said the president hopes the combination of a durable Gaza ceasefire, a new Malaysia trade agreement, and a potential breakthrough with Xi could define his second term’s foreign policy achievements.For Trump, who has repeatedly hinted at his desire to win the Nobel Peace Prize, the trip represents a chance to showcase progress on two fronts he often links together: peace and prosperity. As he put it before boarding Air Force One, “We’re making deals that make sense — for peace, for trade, for the world.”","Qatar is a guarantor of the Gaza truce and has been central to indirect talks between Israel and Hamas since the conflict erupted following Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attack on Israel.

Entered the US illegally but has work authorization, REAL ID



K restriction



Driving under the influence







Sikh driver Jashanpreet Singh, the 21-year-old driver, accused of the crash that killed three people in California, pleaded not guilty to all the charges brought against him -- as a major controversy broke out over Indian truck drivers endangering lives in America. Singh pleaded not guilty to three counts of gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and one count of driving under the influence of a drug. He was appointed a public defender and remained in jail without bail. His next court appearance has been scheduled for November 4, when he will require a Punjabi interpreter.The requirement of a Punjabi interpreter proved that Singh does not know enough English, yet got a driving license for which English knowledge is mandatory.The Department of Homeland Security said Jashanpreet entered the US illegally from India in 2022 during the Biden administration. He has Employment Authorization Documents valid up to 2030 and a commercial driver's license to operate a semitruck. Singh's license is a federal REAL ID, which he was entitled to receive as the federal government gave him a legal status.While California blamed the Trump administration for extending Singh's work authorization, the Trump administration claimed that California violated federal law by allowing Singh to continue driving when he should have been disqualified.In June this year, California issued Singh -- who is an asylum seeker -- a restricted, non-domiciled CDL with a ""K"" restriction, limiting driving to in-state. K restriction is meant for those below 21 years. In September, the federal government paused all issuances of non-domiciled CDLs. In October, Singh turned 21, and his ""K"" restriction was removed. DOT officials say, if California had followed the new rule, Singh's license would have been denied because of his status as an asylum seeker.While Singh pleaded not guilty, his family in India claimed that he is a baptized Sikh and never does drugs. But the toxicology report claimed that he was driving under the influence and could not press the brak,e causing the mishap.","Jashanpreet Singh pleaded not guilty to three counts of gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and one count of driving under the influence of a drug.
