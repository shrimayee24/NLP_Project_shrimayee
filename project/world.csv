NEW DELHI: Ahead of Rahul Gandhi 's Amethi visit on Wednesday, posters were put up in the Congress MP's former Lok Sabha constituency targeting him and leaders of the party-led INDIA bloc for taking a ""pro-Pakistan"" stand amid escalating tensions with the neighbouring country over last week's terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam.Gandhi is on a two-day visit to Rae Bareli, which he currently represents in the Lok Sabha, and Amethi. He visited Rae Bareli on Tuesday.""INDI's hand is with Pakistan,"" one of the posters read. Hand is the Congress' symbol.The poster had comments from National Conference supremo Farooq Abdullah and Congress leader Vijay Wadettiwar. It called Gandhi a ""sympathiser"" of terrorism (""Aatank ka saathi"").Similar banners were put up across the Uttar Pradesh town targeting the opposition INDIA group leaders for making statements ""favouring"" Pakistan.The Congress and other opposition parties have declared their complete support to the government as it plans India's response for the Pahalgam attack, carried out by Pakistan-backed terrorists. However, stray remarks from its leaders forced the grand old party to distance itself from their comments.""Some Congress leaders have been speaking to the media. They speak for themselves and do not reflect the Congress' views. There should be absolutely no doubt whatsoever at this most sensitive of times that the CWC resolution, the views expressed by (Congress president) Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi and the views of authorised AICC office-bearers ALONE represent the position of the Congress (sic),"" Congress general secretary in-charge of communications Jairam Ramesh said in a post on X.Last night, after much outrage, the party deleted a social media post in which it accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of going ""missing"" during the crisis. The image, which showed a headless PM, was captioned ""Gayab"" (missing).","Posters were put up in the Congress MP's former Lok Sabha constituency targeting him and leaders of the party-led INDIA bloc.

While the Pakistani Foreign Ministry issued perfunctory condolences, other leaders have simultaneously issued veiled threats toward India and reaffirmed their support for Kashmiri insurgents, the ideological and logistical base for LeT,"" the letter added.The students noted that ""despite this, senior Pakistani government figures, some directly tied to these statements, are scheduled to attend the Pakistan Conference 2025 at Harvard University.

NEW DELHI: Congress' pictorial post on social media, seemingly portraying PM Modi without his head, caused a furore in BJP. The governing party said the image echoed the Islamist "" sar tan se juda "" call recently made by a Pakistan diplomat in London, who had mocked Indian diaspora with a throat-slitting gesture.Congress posted the image with ""gayab jimmedari ke samay (missing instead of taking responsibility)"" as the caption on its X handle by cropping Modi's head out of what appeared to be an old picture of the PM, with his trademark clothes forming the outline. It did not mention the PM's name.Congress defended the post through the day, arguing that it did not show anyone's name or face. However, with the image going viral on social media, the party deleted it in the evening.Significantly, it was only on Monday that the party, alarmed at its netas making controversial remarks like the one debunking the account of kin of Pahalgam victims that terrorists had marked out non-Muslims before killing them, had said only party chief Mallikarjun Kharge and LoP in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi represented the party's stand.BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia said the post once again exposed sincerity of Kharge's and Rahul's claim of supporting govt in responding to Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. ""This is not an innocent post by Congress. It is a sinister design to weaken the integrity of Bharat,"" he told at a presser.""On one hand, PM Modi and Army have taken a vow to destroy the power which has looked at India with an evil eye, while on the other, its the evil of terror demonic power... Pakistan's thinking and Congress's thinking,"" Bhatia alleged, mocking Congress as ""Lashkar-e-Pakistan Congress"".BJP IT dept head Amit Malviya said on X, ""Congress leaves little doubt with its use of 'sar tan se juda' imagery. This is not a political statement; it is a dog whistle aimed at its Muslim vote-bank and a veiled incitement against the PM.""Following the controversy over the 'Gayab' post, Congress on Tuesday instructed all party netas and workers to stick to the CWC resolution on the Pahalgam attack and said any deviation would be seen as a serious breach of discipline. It is learnt that AICC general secretary KC Venugopal has written to all state units and party functionaries in this regard.Congress also took down the 'Gayab' post amid a feeling within the party that BJP's campaign alleging ""sar tan se juda"" had undercut the mileage the party had sought to generate through letters to the PM seeking a special session of Parliament on the terror hit.The party was also disappointed that the post, with allegations of being ""distasteful"", dented the positive feedback about the party's stand extending support to the govt over the terror attack.The delayed response in taking down the post was said to be due to the leadership's late focus on the issue. Earlier, AICC social media chairperson Supriya Shrinate defended the post, with a detailed video of how Modi has been ""missing"" since the attack.","Congress posted the image with ""gayab jimmedari ke samay (missing instead of taking responsibility)"" as the caption on its X handle.

UK govt says ‘India has full support to go after perpetrators’ of Pahalgam terror attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/uk-govt-says-india-has-full-support-to-go-after-perpetrators-of-pahalgam-terror-attack/articleshow/120741977.cms,"TOI correspondent from London

: The UK govt has said “India has our full support to go after the perpetrators of that attack (Pahalgam terror attack)” and that it is “seeking to play its full diplomatic role to help manage heightened tensions between India and Pakistan” as the tensions spill over onto the streets of Britain.But, foreign office minister Hamish Falconer said in the House of Commons on Tuesday, “It is important there is a proper law-enforcement-led response based on a focus of the actual perpetrators.”Britain said it was “vital that here in the UK all of us in positions of influence at a community level do what we can to ensure those tensions do not play out on British streets. A terrible terrorist attack has been perpetrated … We encourage Pakistanis to cooperate fully with the Indian govt in their efforts to investigate,” Falconer said. He was speaking during a debate on the Pahalgam attack, which left 26 people dead, following an urgent question by Labour MP Gurinder Singh Josan.“The two states are talking to each other, which is welcome. It is understandable the concerns India has for its security in light of such a horrific incident and it is clearly taking steps to try to establish the facts of the incident as best it can and will have British support to do so,” Falconer said.Falconer refrained from commenting on what UK security agencies know as to who is behind the attacks. He said both the Pakistan and India high commissions “will receive all support from the UK state to ensure they remain safe.”A J&K-born man, Ankit Love (41), was charged with criminal damage after allegedly smashing windows at the Pakistan high commission on Sunday. He appeared in court on Monday. He was blacklisted by the Indian govt after being charged with criminal damage for throwing eggs and stones at the India high commission in Feb 2022.Falconer toldMPs he was aware of the throat-slitting gesture video of a Pakistan diplomat. “The Metropolitan police are investigating, so I will not provide any further commentary on that particular incident, but it is obviously concerning,” Falconer said.Several MPs expressed their horror at how Hindus and Christians were targeted in the attack. Others criticised India for suspending the Indus water treaty or making “unfounded claims” against Pakistan or resorting to ""bulldozer tactics"".Labour MP Barry Gardiner asked: “Is it not time to make the support we give to Pakistan conditional on them finally closing down the terrorist training camps that they harbour?”“Until the investigation is concluded, we should not speculate on the nature of the attack. As we understand it, international agreements have been put in abeyance, rather than being rescinded,” Falconer said.","India has our full support to go after the perpetrators of that attack (Pahalgam terror attack), UK govt says.

Muzamil's father, however, defended him, telling reporters Tuesday that his son was just terrified and had no ill intentions. ""Even if a storm comes, we say Allahu Akbar. What is our fault here?

SRINAGAR: National Conference MLA Sajad Shafi alleged Tuesday that the mother of Shaurya Chakra awardee Mudasir Ahmed Sheikh , the J&K Special Operations Group constable who died fighting terrorists in 2022, was among those escorted out of their villages in Uri as part of the govt-ordered exercise to deport citizens of Pakistan or PoK.Baramulla Police contested the allegation, saying “reports circulating on social media regarding the alleged repatriation of the mother of Shaheed constable Mudasir Ahmad @ Bindaas are false, baseless, and categorically denied”.Shafi, who represents Uri in the J&K assembly, said he was shocked to find Shameema Akhtar’s name on the list of prospective deportees. “She gave a brave son to this country,"" he said. “Many other women of my constituency have been asked to return to Pakistan without delay.”Shameema, who travelled to Delhi along with her husband in 2023 to receive their son Mudasir’s posthumous Shaurya Chakra from President Droupadi Murmu, has been living in J&K for 40 years. Her parents were from PoK, locals said.Mudasir had been part of a joint anti-terror operation with the Army in north Kashmir’s Baramulla on May 25, 2022, in which he helped gun down three Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists before being fatally shot.Another woman on the deportation list, Aliza Rafiq, said she moved to Kashmir from PoK in 2013 under the rehabilitation policy introduced during CM Omar Abdullah’s first term in office. She settled in Bandipora’s Nadihal, her husband Mohammad Rafiq Bhat’s ancestral village in north Kashmir, with their two children. A third daughter was born in J&K.Rafiq had crossed over to PoK in 2003 – he was 18 at the time – for arms training. He married Aliza and lived there for a decade before choosing surrender and rehabilitation.""I have received a notice asking me to leave the country with my two older daughters,” Aliza said. “The notice states that any child born here must be left behind. How can I abandon my third daughter, who is 10?”The rehabilitation policy, announced in 2010, had been billed as a major confidence-building measure for J&K. It enabled former terrorists who had settled in PoK to return via four approved routes: Poonch–Rawalakote, Uri–Muzaffarabad, Wagah (Punjab) and Delhi airport.Although widely publicised, the policy lacked clear implementation guidelines. Of the more than 1,200 applications, only about 350 were approved, according to officials. Most returnees, including Rafiq, used the Nepal route to enter India based on a purportedly informal understanding between Delhi and Islamabad.PDP president and ex-CM Mehbooba Mufti said the post-Pahalgam govt directive to deport all Pakistani nationals from India was riddled with “humanitarian concerns”, particularly in J&K. “Many of those affected are women who came to India 30-40 years ago, married Indian citizens, raised families, and have long been part of our society. We urge the govt to reconsider this decision, adopting a compassionate approach regarding women, children and the elderly,” she said.CPM’s M Y Tarigami, too, called for a rethink. “Deporting women from Pakistan and PoK who came here after the govt rolled out the rehabilitation policy in 2010 is inhumane. These women, married to local Kashmiri men, have built their lives here, living peacefully since their arrival,” he said.","Mother of Shaurya Chakra awardee Mudasir Ahmed Sheikh was among those escorted out of their villages in Uri as part of the govt-ordered exercise to deport citizens of Pakistan or PoK.

As she was leaving the venue, a gunman fired at her and then detonated a suicide bomb, fatally injuring Bhutto.While the Pakistani government blamed the Pakistani Taliban and militant leader Baitullah Mehsud for the attack, serious suspicions have persisted about the involvement of elements within Pakistan’s military and intelligence services, particularly the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI).Zardari, who is a former Pakistani foreign minister, threatened India days after New Delhi formally suspended the Indus Waters Treaty, following the deadly terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam that killed 26 people, mostly tourists.""India has accused Pakistan of the Pahalgam incident, with Modi making false allegations to conceal his own weaknesses and deceive his people. He has unilaterally decided to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty, under which India had acknowledged that the Indus belongs to Pakistan.

Either water will flow in this Indus, or their blood will,"" Bhutto, speaking in Sukkur alongside the Indus River, had said.Before Owaisi, Union minister Hardeep Puri had flayed Bhutto, saying the PPP chief needs to get his ""mental condition checked"".“Enough is enough,” Mr. Puri said, warning that India’s patience has worn thin.“Tell him to get his mental condition checked, what kind of statements he is giving... We will no longer tolerate this. Now wait for a few days,” Mr. Puri said, while speaking to news agency ANI.Union minister for commerce Piyush Goyal also slammed Bhutto and expressed confidence that many Pakistani nationals would not even agree with the ex-Pakistan foreign minister's views.""Pakistan is a despondent country and they don’t have any priority apart from spreading terror.

Once cordial, the Trump-Kelce dynamic now faces uncertainty

As the Kansas City Chiefs prepare for their long-overdue White House visit to celebrate their Super Bowl LIV victory, former President Donald Trump has stirred the pot once again with comments that could put a damper on the event. At the center of the controversy: pop superstar Taylor Swift and her high-profile relationship with Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce During a recent ceremony honoring the Philadelphia Eagles at the White House, Trump used the moment to revive an old rivalry. Referencing the Super Bowl where Swift was booed on camera, he quipped, “I saw it in person. I was there with Taylor Swift. How did that thing turn out? How did that thing turn out?” The comment drew laughs from some of the players, but for Swift’s partner, Kelce, the timing and tone may have struck a nerve.The Chiefs, who did not get to visit the White House in 2020 due to COVID-19, are finally slated to make their official appearance. However, Trump’s remarks risk overshadowing the celebration and igniting unnecessary drama—especially given his history of jabs at Swift, including his past comment: “I hate Taylor Swift,” after she publicly endorsed Kamala Harris.What makes Trump’s latest remarks even more surprising is the shift from previous interactions. Prior to the Super Bowl, Trump had publicly praised Kelce on Truth Social, calling him “an incredible running back and the best tight end in football (ever!).”Kelce responded diplomatically, saying, “It’s a great honor, I think no matter who the president is... it’s the biggest game of my life and to have the president there. It’s the greatest country in the world, so it’s great.” That mutual respect now seems at risk of unraveling.As speculation grows around the Chiefs’ upcoming White House visit, all eyes will be on whether Travis Kelce chooses to attend. The event, meant to be a unifying celebration of athletic achievement, may now become mired in political controversy.Also Read: “She’ll probably pay a price”: Trump taunts Taylor Swift at White House, mocks Chiefs' Super Bowl loss in jab at her relationship with Travis Kelce Given the delicate nature of the relationship between Trump and Swift—and by extension Kelce—this latest flare-up adds unnecessary tension to what should be a moment of recognition and pride. For now, the question remains: will personal loyalty trump presidential tradition?",The Kansas City Chiefs are set to visit the White House to celebrate their Super Bowl LIV victory.

New York Giants shut down Donald Trump's claim about Saquon Barkley



The New York Giants have pushed back hard against President Donald Trump’s recent assertion that he urged the franchise to retain Saquon Barkley before the star running back joined the Philadelphia Eagles . The unexpected comment came during a White House event celebrating the Eagles’ Super Bowl LIX victory — a moment that was supposed to spotlight the team's success, not spark political crossfire.While praising Saquon Barkley’s incredible athleticism, Trump shared an anecdote involving the Giants' leadership. “By the way, I have to tell you something,” Trump said. “I was with the Giants and the head coach and some people and said, ‘Do anything you have to, but don’t lose Saquon.’ They lost Saquon.""He added, ""That was not good. I called that one. That was an easy one to call because he played damn well for the Giants. I can tell you that. He made the right decision because it is a team sport, and there’s great people on this team.""However, the Giants swiftly dismissed the former president’s version of events. According to team spokesperson Pat Hanlon, “there were no conversations” between Trump and the Giants organization regarding Barkley’s free agency decision. Hanlon was firm in his denial, and when pressed further by Front Office Sports about whether any dialogue had taken place between the team and Trump, he simply replied, “No,” and pointed toward his personal account on X (formerly Twitter).In a post that captured attention, Hanlon added, “With all due respect, stop yapping. Be the leader we all want you to be. And my 401K wants you to be. I’m trying to retire!!” — a remark that mixed frustration with a dash of humor, while directly tagging Trump’s account.The timing of the controversy added to the public curiosity. Barkley, who had already turned heads for joining the Eagles in free agency, had recently spent a weekend playing golf with Trump. The two were even seen returning to Washington on Air Force One just days before the championship celebration on the South Lawn.While Barkley has not directly commented on Trump’s remarks, the situation has raised eyebrows not only for its political overtones but also for the implications of a former president allegedly involving himself in NFL free agency matters. For the Giants, it was a line they were unwilling to let stand without clarification.As the Eagles revel in their championship glow and Barkley begins a new chapter in Philadelphia, the saga adds yet another twist to a high-profile offseason — and shows how the intersection of politics and sports can still spark headlines when least expected.Also Read: As sexual assault lawsuits mount, Shannon Sharpe’s media empire collapses and future at ESPN hangs by a thread","Donald Trump claimed he urged the New York Giants to keep Saquon Barkley.

Hindustan ke saath ya Pakistan ke?""The BJP leader, speaking to ANI, criticised Congress leaders for their comments in the wake of the April 22 attack. “Congress aur unke netaaon ki kya majboori hai, ki Pakistan ke bol bolne zaruri hain? Why are they supporting Pakistan? Do they not get angry when they see the bloodshed of Indians?” Thakur said, adding that Congress has again exposed its ""pro-Pakistan face.""The minister also targeted Congress veteran Saifuddin Soz , who urged restraint and suggested listening to Pakistan's denial of involvement. “Their leader and former cabinet minister, Saifuddin Soz, asks us to listen to Pakistan when it says it is not involved in the attack, and not to stop the flow of water into Pakistan,” Thakur said.Referring to previous instances, Thakur accused the Congress of undermining India's security efforts . “Congress even raised questions when India carried out a surgical strike... Only a short time has passed, and Congress has already started raising questions about India and siding with Pakistan,” he said. “The face of the pro-Pakistan Congress has been exposed again.”He also reiterated India’s long-standing position on Pakistan's role in fostering terrorism : “There is only one country in the world which has a state policy of terrorist funding, and it is Pakistan. The one who becomes happy after killing innocent people is Pakistan.”The remarks came after Congress leaders Siddaramaiah, RV Timapur, and Soz called for restraint. Siddaramaiah had said that “terrorists did not ask the religion of victims” and later clarified that he was not ruling out war but stressed that it should be the last resort. Soz, meanwhile, stated that “if Pakistan says that it is not involved in the Pahalgam terror attack, let's accept that for a time and ultimately go by investigating agencies,” and called for dialogue between the two neighbours.In response, the Congress distanced itself from individual comments, asserting that only the CWC resolution and statements by authorised AICC leaders reflect the party’s official stance. “It is right that some leaders of the Congress party are saying several things, but this is their personal opinion…The Congress party has nothing to do with these statements, and the party does not agree with such statements,” Congress leader Jairam Ramesh told ANI.","Thakur accused opposition of echoing pro-Pakistan sentiments and asked, ""Who is Congress standing with?

US government's new policy terminates international students' legal status,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-governments-new-policy-terminates-international-students-legal-status/articleshow/120747708.cms,"File Photo (Photo: AP)

Washington, Apr 30 (AP) The US government has begun shedding new light on a crackdown on international students, spelling out how it targeted thousands of people and laying out the grounds for terminating their legal status. The new details emerged in lawsuits filed by some of the students who suddenly had their status cancelled in recent weeks with little explanation.In the past month, foreign students around the US have been rattled to learn their records had been removed from a student database maintained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement . Some went into hiding for fear of being picked up by immigration authorities or abandoned their studies to return home.On Friday, after mounting court challenges, federal officials said the government was restoring international students' legal status while it developed a framework to guide future terminations. In a court filing Monday, it shared the new policy: a document issued over the weekend with guidance on a range of reasons students' status can be cancelled, including the revocation of the visas they used to enter the USBrad Banias, an immigration attorney representing a student whose status was terminated, said the new guidelines vastly expand ICE's authority beyond previous policy, which did not count visa revocation as grounds for losing legal status.""This just gave them carte blanche to have the State Department revoke a visa and then deport those students even if they've done nothing wrong,"" Banias said.Many of the students who had visas revoked or lost their legal status said they had only minor infractions on their record, including driving infractions. Some did not know why they were targeted at all.Lawyers for the government provided some explanation at a hearing Tuesday in the case of Banias' client Akshar Patel, an international student studying information systems in Texas. Patel's status was terminated - and then reinstated - this month, and he is seeking a preliminary court ruling to keep him from being deported.In court filings and in the hearing, Department of Homeland Security officials said they ran the names of student visa holders through the National Crime Information Center, an FBI-run database that contains reams of information related to crimes. It includes the names of suspects, missing persons and people who have been arrested, even if they have never been charged with a crime or had charges dropped.In total, about 6,400 students were identified in the database search, US District Judge Ana Reyes said in the hearing Tuesday. One of the students was Patel, who had been pulled over and charged with reckless driving in 2018. The charge was ultimately dropped - information that is also in NCIC.Patel appears in a spreadsheet with 734 students whose names had come up in NCIC. That spreadsheet was forwarded to a Homeland Security official, who, within 24 hours of receiving it, replied: ""Please terminate all in SEVIS."" That's a different database listing foreigners who have legal status as students in the US.Reyes said the short time frame suggested that no one had reviewed the records individually to find out why the students' names came up in NCIC.""All of this could have been avoided if someone had taken a beat,"" said Reyes, who was appointed by President Joe Biden. She said the government had demonstrated ""an utter lack of concern for individuals who have come into this country.""When colleges discovered the students no longer had legal status, it prompted chaos and confusion. In the past, college officials say, legal statuses typically were updated after colleges told the government the students were no longer studying at the school. In some cases, colleges told students to stop working or taking classes and warned them they could be deported.Still, government attorneys said the change in the database did not mean the students actually lost legal status, even though some of the students were labeled ""failure to maintain status."" Instead, lawyers said, it was intended to be an ""investigative red flag.""""Mr. Patel is lawfully present in the US,"" Andre Watson of the Department of Homeland Security said. ""He is not subject to immediate detention or removal.""Reyes declined to issue a preliminary injunction and urged lawyers from both sides to come to a settlement to ensure Patel could stay in the US.","The new details emerged in lawsuits filed by some of the students who suddenly had their status cancelled in recent weeks.

Reconciliation, excitement

HO CHI MINH: Vietnam mounted its biggest-ever celebration of the fall of Saigon on its 50th anniversary Wednesday, including Chinese troops for the first time after Xi Jinping visited to portray Beijing as a more reliable partner than Washington.Fighter jets and helicopters carrying flags flew overhead, state TV images showed, with a float carrying a portrait of founding leader Ho Chi Minh as part of a march in the city renamed after him.Thousands of people -- many wearing T-shirts emblazoned with the Vietnamese flag -- including families with young children and the elderly stayed out overnight in the streets, sharing food and waiting for the display.The celebrations come half a century after tanks of communist North Vietnam crashed through the gates of the city's presidential palace, defeating the US-backed South and delivering a painful blow to American moral and military prestige.""I am proud of having contributed to liberating the south,"" said 75-year-old veteran Tran Van Truong who had travelled -- dressed in full military uniform -- from the capital Hanoi to see the parade.""But what's gone is gone, I have no hatred for those from the other side of the battle,"" Truong told AFP. ""We should join hands to celebrate the end of the war.""Around 13,000 people, including veterans, soldiers and members of the public, were to march down Ho Chi Minh City's Le Duan Street, a major thoroughfare which leads to the Independence Palace.For the first time, more than 300 soldiers from China, Laos and Cambodia were taking part in the spectacle.More than 300,000 Chinese troops were involved in the bloody conflict, according to state media, providing crucial anti-aircraft defence support and helping with logistics and supplies.But this year is the first time Chinese soldiers have ever been part of large-scale commemorations.Only four years after the end of the Vietnam War, China itself invaded the country, only to be pushed back by Hanoi's troops.""I think Hanoi is signalling to China that they recognise China's historical contribution,"" said Zach Abuza, a professor at the National War College in Washington who focuses on Southeast Asian politics.""It's also another way for them to signal: 'Don't think our foreign policy is lurching towards the Americans.'""After years of fighting that ended on April 30, 1975, the United States and Vietnam have rebuilt ties to become strong trade partners.But Hanoi also follows a ""bamboo diplomacy"" approach, striving to stay on good terms with both Beijing and Washington.The celebrations come after Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Hanoi this month.Beijing is trying to position itself as a stable alternative to Washington as Vietnam confronts a threatened 46 percent US tariff and American foreign aid cuts that could jeopardise war legacy programmes.After a war that eviscerated much of Vietnam, killing millions of its people as well as 58,000 US servicemen, the North's victory expanded communist rule over the whole country.Thousands of Vietnamese who worked for the Southern government fled, while others stayed and were forced into re-education camps.For many years the victory formed the basis of the Communist Party's legitimacy, before its authority became entwined with economic growth and improved living standards.In an article published Sunday on the government's news portal, the party's top leader To Lam put an unusual emphasis on reconciliation.He said Vietnamese people must rid themselves of ""hatred, separation or division... so that future generations no longer have to experience war"".Most of the population was born after the conflict's end, but many young people appeared excited on Tuesday night as music from a celebratory concert blared through the streets and huge crowds began to form.Social media users have been anticipating the parade for days after widespread coverage of rehearsals in the media, which is entirely controlled by the state in Vietnam.Thang Dang, 19, a physical education student at a university in Ho Chi Minh City, was among 250 of his classmates taking part in the parade, carrying Vietnamese national and Communist Party hammer and sickle flags.""I will tell my future children about this event,"" he said ahead of the start. ""I am so proud and my family is so proud too.""","Vietnam mounts its biggest-ever celebration of the fall of Saigon on its 50th anniversary.

China slams US as tensions rise over space observatory project in Chile,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/china-slams-us-as-tensions-rise-over-space-observatory-project-in-chile/articleshow/120747051.cms,"Representative AI image

China on Tuesday pushed back against the United States concerns over its growing presence in Chile, defending a Chinese astronomical project in the country’s north as tensions rise over Beijing’s influence in South America.During a press conference in Santiago, Chinese Ambassador to Chile, Niu Qingbao, criticised US for meddling in Chile's autonomous decisions and disseminating false information about the project.The astronomical initiative originated from a 2023 collaboration between China's National Astronomical Observatory and Chile's Catholic University of the North, planning a space observatory in the Atacama Desert.The proposed telescope would focus on observing near-Earth asteroids and comets. The initiative became caught in the ongoing US-China competition during the Trump administration.Washington's concerns increased regarding China's presence in the Americas, as Beijing increased its investments in Latin American infrastructure, agriculture, energy, and mining sectors, surpassing the US as the region's primary trading partner.At his Senate confirmation hearing in early month, Trump's Chile ambassador nominee Brandon Judd expressed concerns about China's presence in this stable South American nation. He pledged to demonstrate American superiority as a trading partner.""We are the better partner in everything, whether it's Antarctica, fisheries, marine conservation - in all of the areas that are very important to Chile,"" Judd told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the Associated Press reported.""We will continue to strengthen our ties to Chile and limit China's access to all of the resources that Chile might have available,"" Judd added.Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen viewed China's planned Chilean telescope and its Argentine space station as indicators of Beijing's global aspirations.""China is increasing its influence throughout Latin America, throughout Africa, throughout the world, at a time when the United States is pulling back,"" Shaheen said.""That is not in our security interest,"" Shaheen added.The Chilean government subsequently suspended the project for review, with the Foreign Ministry stating its scope needed clarification.Despite China's denials of military purposes, US officials expressed concerns about these space facilities potentially enhancing China's intelligence capabilities.Ambassador Niu rejected these concerns on Tuesday, stating China had no geopolitical interests. He accused the US of creating tensions by mischaracterising Chinese projects.He compared the proposed observatory to existing telescopes in northern Chile, including the American-funded Rubin Observatory launching later this year.""We are closely monitoring the developments of the incident and hope that the Chilean side can eliminate US interference and approve the implementation of the project as soon as possible,"" Niu said.The US State Department offered no immediate response to the ambassador's statements.Chilean government spokesperson Aisen Etcheverry confirmed discussions with both the northern Catholic university and Chinese National Astronomical Observatory regarding the project's alignment with Chilean regulations.Various nations including the US, European Union, and Australia operate observatories in Chile's Atacama Desert. The region's unique characteristics - high altitude, dry climate, stable air, and the Andes Mountains' protection - create ideal conditions for astronomical observation.","Chinese Ambassador to Chile, Niu Qingbao, criticised US for meddling in Chile's autonomous decisions.

Citizen Patrol

SAN DIEGO: Rosalba Hernandez used to keep her children's birth certificates close at hand in case an earthquake struck her part of California. But since Donald Trump returned to the White House, it's more because she's worried about immigration raids.News about high-profile arrests and deportations have characterised Trump's first 100 days back in office, with his administration saying he is making good on campaign promises to clamp down on illegal immigration.That has left undocumented people like Hernandez on edge.""You don't live your normal life anymore,"" Hernandez, 46, told AFP in southern California, which she has called home for half her life.Hernandez, now a mother of five, left Mexico with her eldest daughter in her arms more than two decades ago and arrived in the United States.She was briefly detained under the first Trump administration in 2019, when immigration agents raided the supermarket where she worked.The experience frightened her, but Hernandez, who now works in a restaurant, says she's never been as terrified as she has been in the past three months.""You go to work but you don't know what's going to happen... you don't know if you're going to be able to go home or not,"" she said.""With all the focus on deporting people, they don't care. Even if you don't have a criminal record, you have the bad luck of passing by when they're making an arrest or waiting for someone,"" she added.To reduce the risk of encountering agents, Hernandez now limits her outings only to what is strictly necessary -- and even then she is extra cautious.When she goes to work or takes her children to school -- four of them are US citizens by birth -- she first checks for suspicious cars outside, or consults text chains involving friends, neighbors and non-governmental organizations.""When we see something irregular, we start notifying these organizations, and everything gets put on Facebook, in messages, on Instagram,"" she said.One of these sources of information is Union del Barrio, a group that patrols the streets of San Diego and Los Angeles before dawn to be on the lookout for potential raids.""The goal is to see nothing, but if we see something, we inform the community,"" said Ron Gochez, a member of the organization.""We do this every single day in some different area of Los Angeles. And we're on call 24 hours a day,"" he told AFP during a tour of south-central Los Angeles, a working-class area with a strong immigrant presence.Activists gather at 5:30am to co-ordinate their patrol, looking for the kind of vehicle they believe Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents use.""We're looking for primarily American SUVs, Ford, Chevy, etc. Sometimes they also use pickup trucks or Dodge Challengers.""We're looking for cars with tinted windows.... that could be sometimes double parked.""These patrols began more than two decades ago in San Diego, but increased in frequency this year with the return of Trump.""The community is very scared,"" said Gochez, whose day job is teaching history in a public school.""About 10 percent of my students have disappeared. They just don't go to school anymore.""Gochez, 43, said he knew of at least one student whose family fled to El Salvador for fear of being caught up in raids.Community life has also diminished, he says, with church attendance down, and quinceaneras -- coming-of-age parties for girls turning 15 -- becoming rarer.At the end of each patrol, Union del Barrio posts images on social media so neighbors know if their area is free of raids.This information is vital for people like Hernandez, who says she fears daily being separated from her children.""If I have the opportunity to stay here, it's to help them get ahead and have a better future,"" she said.""I don't want them to have to work sometimes up to 16 hours a day.""Despite the risk, Hernandez said she wasn't afraid of giving an interview and was not ashamed.""I'm not saying anything that isn't true,"" she said.""Like many people, I am working. We're not doing anything bad for this country.""We all come to work, and our work contributes to the economy of this country.""","Rosalba Hernandez, 46, left Mexico with her eldest daughter in her arms more than two decades ago.

SEOUL: North Korea said Wednesday leader Kim Jong Un observed the first test-firings of missiles from a newly launched destroyer and called for accelerating efforts to boost his navy's nuclear attack capabilities. North Korea last week unveiled the 5,000-ton warship equipped with what it called the most powerful weapons built in its warship industry. Kim said it was a significant advancement toward his goal of expanding the operational range and preemptive strike capabilities of his nuclear-armed military.The official Korean Central News Agency said Wednesday that Kim watched the tests of the destroyer's supersonic and strategic cruise missiles, anti-aircraft missile, automatic guns and electronic jamming guns earlier this week.He appreciated the ship's combination of powerful strike weapons and conventional defences and set tasks to speed the nuclear-arming of his navy, the report said.During the ship's launching ceremony, Kim said the destroyer will be deployed early next year. He said the acquisition of a nuclear-powered submarine would be his next big step in strengthening his navy. He underscored the need to beef up North Korea's deterrence capability to cope with what he called escalating US-led hostilities targeting the North.Animosities on the Korean Peninsula are running high as North Korea continues its weapons displays and expands military cooperation with Russia. On Monday, North Korea confirmed for the first time that it has sent combat troops to Russia to support its war efforts against Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin thanked North Korea and promised not to forget the sacrifices of North Korean soldiers for Russia.The US, South Korea and their partners say North Korea has been supplying a vast amount of conventional weapons to Russia as well. They worry Russia will likely in return provide North Korea with high-tech weapons technologies that can enhance its nuclear program as well as shipping other military and economic assistance.","North Korea last week unveiled the 5,000-ton warship equipped with what it called the most powerful weapons built in its warship industry.

Trump talks ‘incredible’ Oval Office, pushes back against economic anxieties

US President Donald Trump brushed off a question from ABC News journalist Terry Moran about his confidence in secretary of defense Pete Hegseth , calling it a ""stupid question,"" asserting that, ""I don’t have 100% confidence that we’re gonna finish this interview.""In a primetime interview with ABC marking his 100th day in office, Trump was questioned about his recent talks with Pete Hegseth, who has been in the spotlight over his use of the encrypted Signal app and ongoing leadership shakeups at the Pentagon.Terry Moran asked, ""Did you take him to the woodshed?""Trump offered a measured response, saying, ""I had a talk with him, and whatever I said, I probably wouldn't be inclined to tell you, but we had a good talk.""""He's a talented guy, he's young, he's smart, highly educated, and I think he's gonna be a very good defense- hopefully a great defense secretary, but he'll be a very good defense secretary,"" Trump added, further praising Hegseth's qualifications and potential.The exchange grew tense when Moran pressed about 100% complete confidence in Hegseth.Trump responded firmly, ""I don't have 100% confidence in anything, okay? Anything,"" rejecting the premise of absolute certainty and calling it ""a stupid question"" despite Moran noting the position's significance.""'Do I have 100%' - It's a stupid question,"" he asserted. ""It's a pretty important position,"" Moran interjected.Trump pushed back strongly, “No, no, no.” “You don’t have 100%—only a liar would say I have 100% confidence.

The 2025 Canadian federal election, held on April 28, delivered a political earthquake that few had predicted: the Liberal Party , led by Mark Carney , secured an improbable fourth consecutive term. While they fell short of a majority, winning approximately 168 seats in the expanded 343-seat House of Commons, it was a clear mandate against populism, external interference, and political instability.The Conservatives finished second with around 143 seats, while the Bloc Québécois fell to about 23, and the New Democratic Party (NDP) was reduced to just 7 seats. Voter turnout surged, fuelled largely by concerns over Canadian sovereignty and an unusually intense focus on domestic unity in the face of global uncertainties.Here are the biggest winners and losers from a contest that reshaped Canada's political direction:From central banker to national leader, Mark Carney’s transition into politics was initially seen as an elite rescue mission. Instead, he led the Liberals to a resilient victory, capitalising on nationalistic sentiments in response to US President Donald Trump's provocative remarks about Canada. Carney positioned himself as a calm, serious antidote to chaos — and voters rewarded him handsomely.If Mark Carney was the face of the campaign, Chrystia Freeland was its architect. As Deputy Prime Minister and a master strategist, Freeland’s work behind the scenes ensured the smooth transition from the Trudeau era and safeguarded the Liberals' Atlantic and urban strongholds. Her influence inside the party has now reached its zenith, making her a future contender for the top job.In Atlantic Canada, the Liberals reminded the country what old-school politics looks like. Ground game, loyal networks, and localised campaigning led to a near sweep in Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island. It was a textbook lesson in political muscle memory.The election marked one of the highest turnouts in recent decades. Canadians, usually reserved in their political engagement, turned out in record numbers — spurred by anxieties about foreign influence, economic stability, and national unity. Democracy, for once, was not just a ritual but a rally.If there was any doubt about the Liberals’ lock on Canada's major cities, it has now been obliterated. Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver — all continued to paint themselves Liberal red, deepening the urban-rural divide and offering the party a crucial firewall against Conservative advances elsewhere.For Pierre Poilievre, it was a disaster. Touted as the Conservative saviour, he instead became its cautionary tale — failing not only to secure a majority but also losing his own seat. His brand of American-style populism, sharp rhetoric, and free-market absolutism alienated the very suburban voters Conservatives needed to win.Jagmeet Singh’s once-bright star dimmed dramatically. Reduced to a mere 7 seats nationally, the NDP haemorrhaged support to the Liberals as progressive voters rallied to prevent a Conservative government. To make matters worse, Singh lost his own seat, prompting immediate questions about his future leadership.In a year when sovereignty was on everyone’s lips, the Bloc Québécois found themselves talking about the wrong kind. Voters in Quebec, worried more about federal stability than independence dreams, turned away. The Bloc’s seat count fell sharply, and the movement that once shook Ottawa seemed to lose its voice.Historically, some Khalistani advocacy groups managed to exert a degree of influence among segments of the Indo-Canadian community, particularly during the turbulent decades of the 1980s and 1990s. With a keen focus on economic stability, multicultural integration, and strengthened bilateral relations with India, the electorate overwhelmingly chose mainstream political platforms over radical separatist agendas. Contemporary public sentiment, supported by robust law enforcement and legislative initiatives against violent extremism, has marginalized Khalistani-linked efforts—rendering them politically isolated and increasingly irrelevant in a Canadian political arena that now prizes unity and pragmatic governance.Donald Trump was not on the ballot, but his shadow loomed large. His brash comments about Canada being the ""51st American state"" and his aggressive tariff policies galvanised a nationalist backlash. Canadian voters rallied behind leaders who promised to preserve their sovereignty, effectively turning Trump into an unintentional campaign villain.","The 2025 Canadian federal election, held on April 28, delivered a political earthquake that few had predicted.

A massive fire broke out at an electrical substation in Maida Vale, West London in the early hours of Tuesday. Firefighters responded to the blaze shortly after 5:30 am following over 170 emergency calls.

The cause of the fire is not yet known.This is the second major substation fire in West London in recent weeks. In March, a fire at a substation near Heathrow Airport led to the cancellation of over 1,000 flights.

Canadian PM Mark Carney's Liberals staged a major political comeback to retain office in parliamentary elections, fuelled by a backlash against US President Donald Trump's tariffs and comments on making Canada the 51st US state. With almost all votes counted, results from Elections Canada showed that the Liberals had won 168 electoral districts, just short of the 172-majority mark, followed by Conservatives with 144.Conservative chief Pierre Poilievre, who three months ago had looked certain to sweep the polls, lost his seat in the Ontario district of Carleton.Tensions with the US caused supporters of two smaller parties, the left-leaning New Democratic Party and the separatist Bloc Quebecois, to shift to the Liberals. NDP chief Jagmeet Singh, known for his pro-Khalistan tilt, conceded defeat in his own district and said he planned to quit as party leader. NDP was projected to win just seven seats, down from 24 in the last House, where Singh was a 'kingmaker'. AgenciesWhatever Trump meant when he told interviewers, ""I run the country and the world,"" Canadians have given the truth to the statement in a sharpish way. Until Trump returned to the White House in Jan, Canadians were set to throw out the Liberals and vote in the Conservatives. A solid anti-incumbency had built up against the Liberals after a decade in govt. That mood got reflected in Trudeau's exit, for example. But then, drumrolls, enter The Don, declaring he wants to turn Canada into the 51st state of America, topping up the annexation threats with yuge tariffs. Poor Pierre Poilievre has paid the heaviest price. His Conservatives' authoritative 25-point lead collapsed to nada within four months and he's even lost his own seat.This is a sentiment seen in India too, that the country unites in the face of an outside enemy. Canada has united against what's widely seen as Trump's bullying. Its identity has been as a friend of America but also emphatically as non-America. To be kicked in its teeth by a neighbour it's always supported, for no rhyme or reason that anybody can sensibly explain, has united the country, collapsed support for the smaller parties, and all the advantage has swung to the Liberal Party. Because its post-Trudeau face Mark Carney has gone all out to defend Canada from Trump with vim and vigour.Cometh the hour cometh the man. Carney had never before fought an election but he's been the governor of Bank of Canada and even Bank of England. What's also notable from New Delhi's point of view is that NDP vote share has collapsed and its chief Jagmeet Singh has lost his seat. It will likely find doing business with this Canadian govt to be much more pleasant than in the Trudeau era.","Canadian PM Mark Carney's Liberals staged a major political comeback to retain office in parliamentary elections. fuelled by a backlash against US President Donald Trump's tariffs and comments on making Canada the 51st US state.

Poll Do you believe that the recent bombing in South Waziristan was a targeted attack against the peace committee? No Yes

At least seven people were killed and 16 others wounded on Monday after a powerful bomb exploded outside the office of a pro-government peace committee in South Waziristan, northwest Pakistan.The blast occurred in Wana, the main city in South Waziristan district, a region once considered a stronghold of the Pakistani Taliban.Usman Wazir, a local police chief, was quoted by news agency The Associated Press as saying that the bomb specifically targeted the peace committee office, which publicly opposes the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). The committee also plays a role in resolving local disputes. Police officials described the explosion as “powerful,” leaving significant casualties and damage at the scene.No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. However, suspicion quickly turned toward the TTP, which frequently targets security forces, civilians, and organisations seen as collaborating with the Pakistani state.The Pakistani Taliban, while a distinct entity, maintains close ties with the Afghan Taliban who took power in Afghanistan in 2021 following the withdrawal of US and Nato troops.The blast came just a day after Pakistan’s military announced it had killed 54 militants during an operation in the neighbouring North Waziristan district. According to AP, those militants had attempted to cross into Pakistan from Afghanistan, underlining the continued volatility along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.The Pakistani Taliban’s resurgence has been a major concern for Islamabad, particularly since many of its leaders and fighters have found safe haven in Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover.Meanwhile, Pakistan's security situation remains tense in other regions as well. In a separate incident in Balochistan province, the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for a deadly roadside bomb attack on April 25, which killed ten Pakistani military personnel and injured three others in Quetta.The BLA said that a remote-controlled IED was used in the attack targeting a bomb disposal squad vehicle.Pakistan continues to face threats from insurgent groups across different provinces. While the TTP focuses mainly on Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and border regions, the BLA has carried out a series of deadly attacks in Balochistan.","A powerful bomb exploded outside the office of a pro-government peace committee in South Waziristan, northwest Pakistan.

DHAKA: Radical Islamist group Hefazat-e-Islam Bangladesh has warned chief adviser Muhammad Yunus that he will be treated like deposed Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina if the interim govt pushes ahead with implementing ""anti-Islamic"" proposals made by the Women's Affairs Reform Commission. Hefazat leaders also condemned the proposals as being in direct conflict with the Quran and Sunnah. Meanwhile, Khelafat Majlis also called for the abolition of the Commission. ""This is against the Quran and Sunnah and threatens the religious identity of Muslims,"" said secretary general Ahmad Abdul Quader.Hefazat's warning came during nationwide protests triggered by the Commission's recent report, which Hefazat claims goes against Islamic law . Speaking at a protest site in Narayanganj on Friday, Hefazat joint secretary general Mamunul Haque said, ""We welcomed five of the six reform commissions, but the proposals from the Women's Affairs Reform Commission are shocking. They blame religious and social norms for gender discrimination, which is a clear rejection of Islamic law."" Referring to Yunus, Haque said, ""We have shown him respect, but if he insists on pushing this agenda, we will be compelled to treat him no differently than Sheikh Hasina.""",Hefazat-e-Islam Bangladesh has warned chief adviser Muhammad Yunus that he will be treated like deposed Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.
