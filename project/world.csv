'Shame': Trump trade adviser's fresh attack on India after RIC huddle at SCO; takes jibe at PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shame-trump-trade-advisors-fresh-attack-on-india-after-ric-huddle-at-sco-takes-jibe-at-pm-modi/articleshow/123646265.cms,"



NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro on Tuesday said that ""it is a shame"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi shared the stage with the ""two biggest authoritarian dictators"" in the world during the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in China.While talking to reporters, Navarro said that PM Modi needs to step up and be with Europe and Ukraine, and stop ""buying oil from Russia.""""The road to peace in many ways runs at least partly through New Delhi. It's time for Modi to step up. I have great respect for Modi. I love the Indian people. It was a shame to see Modi getting in bed, as the leader of the biggest democracy in the world, with the two biggest authoritarian dictators in the world, Putin and Xi Jinping,"" Navarro said.""So we hope that the Indian leader comes around to seeing that he needs to be with us in Europe and Ukraine and not with Russia on this, and he needs to stop buying the oil,"" he added.This comes a day after the White House trade counselor ignited a firestorm in the ongoing US-India trade spat, alleging, in reference to India selling refined Russian oil to the West, that ""Brahmins are profiteering at the expense of the Indian people.""""Look, Modi's a great leader. I don't understand why he's getting into bed with Putin and Xi Jinping when he's the biggest democracy in the world. So I would just simply say to the Indian people: please, understand what's going on here. You've got Brahmins profiteering at the expense of the Indian people. We need that to stop. Yeah, and we'll be watching that closely,"" he said during an interview with Fox News.Navarro has made multiple jabs at India as the latter refuses to budge on ceasing trade with Russia. These included calling the Russia-Ukraine war ""Modi's war,"" branding India ""Kremlin's laundromat,"" and accusing New Delhi of fueling the Ukraine war for profit.The Trump administration, earlier this month, ramped up attacks on India for buying Russian oil, with Navarro characterizing the Russia-Ukraine conflict as ""Modi's war,"" and cautioning New Delhi about getting close to Beijing and Moscow.""India, you're the biggest democracy in the world, okay? Act like one... side with the democracies. (Instead) you're getting in bed with the authoritarians,"" Navarro had said, just hours after 50% tariffs on India went into effect.Trump has imposed 25 per cent reciprocal tariffs on India and an additional 25 per cent for Delhi’s purchases of Russian oil.India has termed the tariffs imposed on it as “unjustified and unreasonable.”“Like any major economy, India will take all necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security,” India has said.Meanwhile, on Friday, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that most of Trump's sweeping global tariffs are unlawful.Following this, the Democrats on the House Foreign Affairs Committee called on Speaker Mike Johnson to put on the floor US Representative Gregory Meeks' resolution to terminate Trump's ""national emergency"" declaration, which he used to impose the massive tariffs.Quoting Meeks in a social media post, it also called for the Speaker to ""stop covering for Trump’s lawlessness.""","US President Donald Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro on Tuesday said that ""it is a shame"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi shared the stage with the ""two biggest authoritarian dictators"" in the world during the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in China.

‘No power to impose’: US court declares most tariffs illegal; Trump says 'total disaster for country',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/no-power-to-impose-tariff-us-court-declares-most-trump-tariffs-illegal-judge-cites-overreach/articleshow/123592775.cms,"Donald Trump (File -AP)

India’s ‘Befitting Response’ To Trump’s 50% Tariffs; Sets Russian Oil 'Import Record' | Report





A US federal appeals court on Friday ruled that most tariffs imposed by president Donald Trump under emergency powers were illegal, striking at the heart of his trade policy and setting up a likely battle in the Supreme Court The ruling by the US court of appeals for the federal circuit in Washington, DC, covered two sets of tariffs - Trump’s “reciprocal” duties imposed in April as part of his trade war and another set announced in February against China, Canada and Mexico. It does not affect other tariffs Trump imposed under separate statutes, including those on steel and aluminum imports.In a 7-4 judgement the court observed: “The statute bestows significant authority on the President to undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency, but none of these actions explicitly include the power to impose tariffs, duties, or the like, or the power to tax,” as quoted by Reuters.The decision also said Trump had exceeded his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).Trump had invoked IEEPA, a 1977 law historically used for sanctions and asset freezes, to justify tariffs by declaring a national emergency over persistent US trade deficits and cross-border drug flows. The administration argued that the law’s power to “regulate” imports extended to tariffs.The appeals court rejected that view, saying: “It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs. The statute neither mentions tariffs (or any of its synonyms) nor has procedural safeguards that contain clear limits on the President’s power to impose tariffs.”The appeals court put its ruling on hold until October 14, allowing the Trump administration time to seek a reversal from the Supreme Court.Minutes after the ruling, President Donald Trump sharply criticised the judgement, saying if allowed it would be a “ total disaster for the Country”.In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, he attacked the appeals courts as ""Highly Partisan"" and asserted that the Supreme Court would rule in his favour.“If these Tariffs ever went away, it would be a total disaster for the Country,” Trump wrote in his post. “If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America.”“The President’s tariffs remain in effect, and we look forward to ultimate victory on this matter,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a separate statement, as quoted by CNBC.Trump has relied heavily on tariffs in his second term, using them as a central tool of US foreign policy to pressure trading partners and push for revised trade agreements. While the duties have helped his administration secure economic concessions, they have also added to uncertainty in financial markets.The lawsuits were filed separately by five small US businesses and a coalition of 12 Democratic-led states, who argued that under the Constitution, the power to issue taxes and tariffs lies with Congress and any delegation of that authority must be both explicit and limited.Trump had defended the tariffs as a way to rebalance global trade and protect US industries. He said the April tariffs were necessary because the US had imported more than it exported for decades, undermining manufacturing and military readiness.He also said the February tariffs against China, Canada and Mexico were justified because those countries were not doing enough to curb the flow of illegal fentanyl into the US - an assertion those governments have denied.The New York-based US Court of international trade had earlier ruled against Trump’s tariff policies on May 28, saying the president had exceeded his powers when imposing both sets of challenged tariffs. That three-judge panel included one judge appointed by Trump during his first term. Another court in Washington also found that IEEPA does not authorize tariffs, with the government appealing that decision.According to Reuters, at least eight lawsuits have been filed against Trump’s tariff measures, including one brought by the state of California.While the latest decision restricts tariffs imposed under IEEPA, it leaves intact those imposed under other legal authorities. The Justice Department is expected to appeal, with the case likely headed to the US Supreme Court.","US federal appeals court rules that most tariffs imposed by president Donald Trump under emergency powers were illegal.

But terrorism, separatism and extremism are big challenges in this path. Terrorism is not just a challenge to the security of a country but a common challenge for all of humanity.""""We have to say clearly and unanimously that no double standards are acceptable on terrorism,"" he added.""This attack was an open challenge to every country and person who believes in humanity. In such a situation, it is natural to raise the question of whether the open support of terrorism by some countries can be acceptable to us. We have to unanimously oppose terrorism in every form and colour. This is our duty towards humanity,” the Prime Minister further said.PM Modi also took a veiled jibe at China's Belt and Road Initiative as he said that connectivity loses its trust and meaning if it bypasses sovereignty.While speaking at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Summit in China's Tianjin, PM Modi pointed to the SCO Charter and said that connectivity should always respect sovereignty and territorial integrity.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday addressed the plenary session at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit in Tianjin and called for a united global fight against terrorism.

That is why we are working on Chabahar and the International North-South Economic Corridor, which will enhance connectivity to Afghanistan and Central Asia,"" he added.SCO member states ""strongly condemned"" the terrorist attack in Pahalgam on April 22, expressing their deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the deceased and the injured.""The Member States strongly condemned the terrorist attack in Pahalgam on 22 April 2025. They expressed their deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the dead and the wounded. They further stated that perpetrators, organisers and sponsors of such attacks must be brought to justice,"" the declaration read.The declaration emphasised that the perpetrators, organisers and sponsors of such attacks must be brought to justice.PM Modi and Putin also travelled in the same car to the destination of their bilateral meeting after the conclusion of the SCO Summit in China's Tianjin.In a social media post on X, PM Modi shared the image and said, ""After the proceedings at the SCO Summit venue, President Putin and I travelled together to the venue of our bilateral meeting.""According to news agency PTI, PM Modi was offered a lift by Putin in his Aurus limousine to reach the venue.“The two leaders continued their one-to-one dialogue on the way to the hotel where they were to be joined by members of their teams.

Misri said a banquet was replaced by a brief interaction due to scheduling constraints.The SCO currently has 10 member states, with India becoming a full member in 2017.Meanwhile, India’s S-400 “Sudarshan Chakra” missile defence systems played a crucial role during “Operation Sindoor” on the night of May 7 and 8. The Indian Air Force successfully intercepted Pakistani drones and missiles aimed at 15 Indian cities, according to ANI reports quoting domain experts.Officials confirmed that debris from Pakistani drones and missiles was recovered at multiple sites, providing evidence of the attack. India’s Integrated Counter-UAS Grid and Air Defence systems thwarted the attempt, preventing damage to key assets.The S-400 “Sudarshan Chakra” — India’s name for the Russian-made Triumf system — can engage targets up to 400 km away and detect threats as far as 600 km. Equipped with phased-array radar, it can track over 100 targets simultaneously and neutralise threats ranging from drones to ballistic missiles.India signed a $5.43 billion deal with Russia in 2018 for five S-400 units, the first of which was deployed in Punjab in 2021. The advanced system is seen as a game-changer in South Asia, bolstering India’s multi-layered air defence and giving it a strategic edge against Pakistan and China.The government described the May 7 strikes as “focused, measured, and non-escalatory,” clarifying that no Pakistani military installations were targeted. However, after Pakistan escalated on Wednesday, Indian forces struck back, neutralising Pakistani air defence systems, including one in Lahore.","PM Modi, Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping were seen laughing together and engaging in a cordial conversation.

Tom Brady’s newsletter sparked tension with Bündchen

Gisele Bündchen focused on peace and a new chapter with Joaquim Valente



Back in August, headlines swirled once again around Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen — not for their divorce settlement, but because of a newsletter penned by the NFL legend. The retired quarterback, who often used his personal platform to share insights on parenting and discipline, appeared to strike a nerve with his ex-wife. His words, meant to frame himself as a hands-on father, reportedly deepened the rift in their already fragile post-divorce relationship.In his 199th edition, Brady wrote about “being a great father” and insisted that “reading bedtime stories and helping them with homework are not the only ways to be a great parent.” While the remark seemed general, insiders claimed Bündchen interpreted it as a pointed dig. According to one source, the supermodel felt frustrated with the ongoing “narrative that he sacrificed everything for them,” adding bluntly, “he didn’t. She did.”The fallout reportedly shifted their co-parenting dynamic. A separate insider told Rob Shuter’s #ShuterScoop that there was no “real relationship” left between the two. Their interaction, the source added, had become “strictly logistics” — limited to “drop-offs, pick-ups, school events” for their children, Benjamin and Vivian.While Brady’s comments stirred controversy, Bündchen appeared to be moving forward.By then, she had already welcomed a child with her boyfriend, Joaquim Valente, in May 2025. The couple’s growing family fueled speculation about wedding plans, with Bündchen sharing glimpses of their happiness on social media, including a tender Mother’s Day post introducing their baby.Also Read: Post-Tom Brady glow? Gisele Bündchen wows in sizzling new fashion campaign just months after welcoming baby Reports suggested the model was focused on “peace” and creating stability in her new life, even as whispers from Brady’s camp resurfaced. The former couple’s story, long dissected by fans and tabloids, underscored how their split was not just about divorce papers but about clashing narratives of sacrifice, parenting, and personal reinvention.","Tom Brady’s newsletter sparked tension with Gisele Bündchen.

'Totally one sided': Trump on trade with India







US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Tuesday expressed confidence in resolving trade frictions with India claiming that the ""two great countries will get this solved"". Bessent, however, down played the significance of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit where Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping.When asked about PM Modi’s engagement with Putin and Xi on the sidelines of the SCO summit in Tianjin, Bessent was dismissive. “This is a longstanding meeting, it’s called the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and I think it’s largely performative,” he said, speaking to Fox News at Martin’s Tavern in Washington.“I think at the end of the day, India is the most populous democracy in the world. Their values are much closer to ours and to China’s than to Russia’s.”The US Treasury Secretary was also asked on India’s deepening ties with Russia, particularly its purchases of discounted oil, which Washington argues is helping to fund Moscow’s war effort.Bessent suggested that, despite current tensions, Washington remains confident about the long-term relationship. “I think at the end of the day, two great countries will get this solved. But the Indians have not been great actors in terms of buying Russian oil and then reselling it, financing the Russian war effort in Ukraine,” he said.Bessent also confirmed that President Donald Trump is prepared to consider further sanctions on Russia in response to Moscow's continued attacks on Ukraine. “So I think with President Trump, all options are on the table, and I think we’ll be examining those very closely this week,” he added. His remarks came as Russia unleashed a fresh barrage of missiles and drones on Kyiv, killing at least 17 people, including four children.Bessent said Moscow had escalated its attacks on Ukraine despite repeated overtures for peace. “I think everything’s on the table,” he said. “President Putin, since the historic meeting in Anchorage, since the phone call, when the European leaders and President Zelensky were at the White House the following Monday, has done the opposite of following through on what he indicated he wanted to do. As a matter of fact, he has, in a despicable, despicable manner, increased the bombing campaign. ”President Trump echoed similar frustrations on social media, calling the US-India relationship “totally one sided” and accusing New Delhi of maintaining “the highest tariffs in the world”. India has rejected the tariffs as “unjustified and unreasonable”, insisting that its energy security and agricultural interests cannot be compromised.Other senior Trump officials have struck a sharper tone. Trade adviser Peter Navarro accused Indian refiners of turning the country into a “massive refining hub and oil money laundromat for the Kremlin” and went further in attacking “Brahmins profiteering at the expense of the Indian people.” While describing Modi as a “great leader,” Navarro argued that India’s continued engagement with Putin and Xi undermines its role as the world’s largest democracy.The Trump administration has already imposed reciprocal tariffs of 25 per cent on Indian goods and an additional 25 per cent levy on oil imports linked to Russia, pushing overall duties to 50 per cent — among the highest in the world.","US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed confidence in resolving trade frictions with India claiming that the ""two great countries will get this solved"" He down played the significance of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit where Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Russian President Vladimir Putin.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123645806,imgsize-943758,width-400,resizemode-4/scott-bessent.jpg"

Protesters marched in several US cities on Labour Day, criticising president Donald Trump's policies. Hundreds of events were organised by labour groups, local activists and opposition Democratic Party officials.In New York, crowds gathered outside Trump Tower, chanting “Trump must go now” and carrying signs denouncing what they called a fascist regime. Trump has not lived in the building for years, but it continues to be a rallying point for demonstrations.Similar protests were held outside Trump Tower in Chicago, where chants included “No National Guard” and “Lock him up.”Large gatherings also took place in Washington DC, San Francisco and other West Coast cities. In Washington, protesters carried signs reading “Stop the ICE invasion” and “Free DC No masked thugs.” Along the West Coast, from San Diego to Seattle, rallies focused on immigrant rights, and low wages.In Chicago, where Trump has discussed deploying National Guard troops to address street crime, multiple groups joined together to hear speeches.Evanston mayor Daniel Biss told the crowd, “We’re here because our core values and our democracy are under attack.They are threatening to send the military into our streets.”A brief confrontation broke out when a woman shouted support for Trump and the protesters responded with shouts of their own until the woman left a few minutes later.Union members and worker rights groups also marched in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Portland.The Labour Day demonstrations added to a series of recent protests, including the “May Day” rallies on May 1, the “No Kings” marches in June and last month’s demonstrations against Trump’s plan to redraw congressional districts.","Hundreds of events were organised by labour groups, local activists and opposition Democratic Party officials.

Thousands of Australians on Sunday participated in anti-immigration demonstrations nationwide, which the center-left government denounced as being associated with neo-Nazis and intended to incite hatred. According to the group's website, March for Australia marches against immigration took place in Sydney as well as other state capitals and rural hubs.According to the Australian Broadcasting Corp, between 5,000 and 8,000 people had gathered for the event in Sydney, many of them wearing Australian flags. It took place close to the Sydney Marathon track, where 35,000 racers ran through the streets on Sunday before coming to a stop at the Opera House.""Mass migration has torn at the bonds that held our communities together,"" according to the website. The rally's goal, the group wrote on X on Saturday, was to accomplish ""what the mainstream politicians never have the courage to do: demand an end to mass immigration.""In addition, the group claims that it is worried about infrastructure, hospitals, crime, wages, traffic, housing and water supply, culture, and the loss of community.Right-wing extremism, including neo-Nazi protests, has been on the rise in Australia, a country where one in two people was born abroad or has an overseas parent.""We vehemently oppose today's March for Australia demonstration,"" said Murray Watt, a senior minister in the Labor government.

Hundreds Killed, 1000 Injured As Powerful Quake Flattens Afghanistan | Shocking Scenes On Cam

Poll Do you believe the international community should provide more aid to earthquake victims in Afghanistan? Yes No





At least 800 people were killed and thousands injured in a strong earthquake that struck Afghanistan on Monday. Tremors were felt across eastern Afghanistan in the districts of Nur Gul, Soki, Watpur, Manogi, and Chapadare and parts of Pakistan.Sediqullah Quraishi Badloon, a communications official for Nangarhar province, said most of the casualties were reported in Kunar, while nine deaths occurred in Nangarhar. The quake struck about 27 km east-northeast of Jalalabad, a city of nearly 200,000 people, at 11:47 pm local time (1917 GMT), according to the US Geological Survey. It was followed by at least three aftershocks.“The number of casualties and injuries is high, but since the area is difficult to access, our teams are still on site,” health minister Sharafat Zaman said. Kunar’s provincial information head, Najibullah Hanif, added that hundreds of injured were taken to hospitals, with the toll expected to rise as reports come from remote districts.The midnight quake struck at a shallow depth of around 8–10 km, toppling mud and stone homes along the mountainous border with Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region. Rescuers were operating across multiple districts, searching the rubble for survivors.Authorities confirmed that several children died when their home’s roof collapsed.Buildings shook for several seconds in Jalalabad and other towns, while tremors were also felt in Islamabad, nearly 370 km away, AFP reported.Earthquakes are a recurring disaster in Afghanistan, where much of the population lives in fragile housing near geological faults. The country’s position at the junction of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates, particularly in the Hindu Kush region, makes it highly vulnerable to seismic activity. Each major quake further strains reconstruction efforts in a nation already battered by decades of conflict.","At least 800 people were killed and thousands injured in a strong earthquake that struck Afghanistan on Monday.

MUMBAI: After a two-hour hearing on Monday, Bombay High Court said, ""We give an opportunity to Jarange and others to clean up the city and vacate the roads and all such places blocked except the designated place by noon tomorrow. We hope and trust that good counsel will prevail on Jarange and others and they will obey the orders.'' The HC said the matter will be heard by the regular bench on Tuesday for further orders.The HC had set up the special bench comprising Justice Ghuge and Justice Gautam Ankhad for urgent hearing on petitions challenging permissions granted for the Maratha quota protest. The petitions said lakhs of people supporting Jarange had brought the city to a standstill and the govt had failed to protect Mumbaikars' fundamental rights to free movement and pursuit of livelihood.The protest, which entered its fourth day on Monday, has drawn an estimated 35,000-45,000 people, who arrived in the city in about 650 vehicles. The Advocate General read out the Rules and undertakings given by the protesters as well as the earlier HC order and said permission from police was for only one day subject to conditions including that not more than 5,000 people will assemble and the premises will be vacated by 6 pm.On Aug 26, a Bombay HC bench of then Chief Justice Alok Aradhe and Justice Sandeep Marne had said that Jarange and his associates shall not stage any protest at Azad Maidan till they seek and obtain permission under the Public Meetings Rules. The rules impose obligations on protestors and organisers to maintain order and not disrupt city life.""There has been flagrant violations of the Rules and the order of the Court,'' the AG said, adding that police authorities are under pressure considering the Ganpati festival and have done a delicate balance on law and order. Saraf said in such circumstances where thousands of men, women and children are on the streets for Ganpati, police instead of taking coercive steps, have tried to convince the protesters to vacate public roads and spaces.A PIL filed by advocate Nilesh Tribhuvan challenged traffic restrictions imposed on key routes including the Eastern Freeway due to the Maratha Kranti Morcha's activities. It said the restrictions violated fundamental rights of citizens to free movement and pursuit of livelihood. Govt had failed to regulate crowds and protest timings, effectively leading to traffic paralysis, and risks to emergency services, it said. It asked for the protest to be declared illegal and sought directions to the state to relocate the protestors to alternative venues and establish SOPs for large assemblies. Lawyer Gunratan Sadavarte who appeared as a petitioner against reservation for Marathas, said the protests were politically motivated and intended to target chief minister Devendra Fadnavis.The HC instructed that the protestors be given food packets and water at the Maidan and that Jarange, who said he is on a fast unto death, be allowed medical assistance. The bench asked the lawyers representing the protesters to convince Jarange to ensure agitators exceeding 5,000 vacate Mumbai to enable peaceful protests after fresh applications are made to the authorities.The HC also noted that Jarange's lawyer tactfully did not reply when asked whether the protestors had permission to occupy the streets. ""We, therefore, posed a question as to whether these protesters would clean up the streets, vacate the streets and go back home and let peace and tranquility prevail in Mumbai, so that the common man leads a normal life. He had no answer, but he submits that he will strive to convince Jarange to convince the protesters to vacate the streets,"" the HC said.","The Bombay High Court said the matter will be heard by the regular bench on Tuesday for further orders.

BENGALURU: It had all the trappings of a celluloid thriller: An older man consumed by obsession, a young woman in multiple relationships over time, and a chase ending in a public execution.Yet, this was no silver screen drama. This was a real-life incident that played out on the streets of Hulimavu in Bengaluru, much to the shock of the eye-witnesses.The victim, identified as 25-year-old Vanajakshi, was burned alive on Saturday afternoon by her 52-year-old former live-in partner Vittal, who just couldn't digest the presence of another man in Vanajakshi's life.Following Vanajakshi's death in hospital on Sunday night, leaving behind an eight-year-old son, police arrested Vittal, who was later remanded in judicial custody.Police said Vanajakshi was with her male companion Muniyappa on Aug 30, when Vittal reached the spot, doused her with petrol and set her on fire.Muniyappa, a businessman, in his complaint said Vanajakshi was married to Madhu, in his mid-50s. Due to a marital discord, the couple parted ways before Madhu died.Thereafter, Vanajakshi was living with her son in Bilwaradahalli on Bannerghatta Road. Muniyappa often visited their house.On the day of the incident, Vanajakshi and Muniyappa were on their way to St John's Hospital to visit Vanajakshi's elder sister's son, who was admitted there, when the attack took place.While the duo was near Hommadevanahalli, Vittal started tailing them and honked repeatedly. When Muniyappa's car stopped due to a traffic jam, Vittal got off his car and poured petrol on Muniyappa's vehicle.Taken aback, a frightened Muniyappa told Vanajakshi to immediately get off the car. As she got off and tried to run, she tripped and fell.

What Alexis Wilkins said in her lawsuit



“[FBI Director Kash Patel] has had his own little ‘ honeypot’ issue that’s been going on of late, so we’re just going to acknowledge it real publicly. He’s got a girlfriend that is half his age, who is apparently is both a country music singer, a political commentator on Rumble, a friend of John Rich through Bongino, who also now owns a big chunk of Rumble, and she’s also a former Mossad agent in what is like the equivalent of their NSA. But I’m sure that’s totally because, like, she’s really looking for like a cross-eyed, you know, kind of thickish built, super cool bro who’s almost 50 years old who’s Indian in America. Like it has nothing to do with the fact that we’re really close to the Trump administration. Anyway, I’m sure that’s totally just like love. That’s what real love looks like.”

“Definitely not. That is a firm no.”

“I’ve spent my career saying no to anything that would compromise my character and working to restore America. It’s disappointing to see people with no real contribution to political discourse spin ridiculous conspiracy theories out of thin air. These accusations are obviously insanely ridiculous and coming from accounts that are farming because their engagement dried up after Trump’s win.

I would encourage anyone interested to actually research the facts of my life — they’re readily available.

At the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit in China's Tianjin, camaraderie between three major world leaders -- Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Russian President Vladimir Putin , and Chinese President Xi Jinping -- drew attention worldwide. In the United States, reactions appeared divided. California Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat and vocal critic of US President Donald Trump , used the moment to take a swipe at him.Sharing a clip of PM Modi, Putin, and Xi's friendly interaction, Newsom posted on X: “But have no fear, Trump is sending the Guard to Chicago.”The video showed PM Modi and President Putin holding hands as they walked jovially toward Xi, with all three sharing a laugh while standing shoulder to shoulder.In one widely circulated clip, PM Modi is even seen pulling Putin and Xi together in a symbolic gesture of unity.The jab from Newsom came after Trump hinted last week that he planned to deploy National Guard personnel to Chicago and New York, a move that has already drawn sharp criticism from Democrats.","California Governor Gavin Newsom posted a clip of PM Modi, Putin, and Xi's friendly interaction.

US president Donald Trump has a low approval rating, according to recent surveys by Gallup, Reuters/Ipsos and other pollsters.More than seven months into his presidency, the numbers show continued low approval, with Americans divided over his handling of the economy, immigration and the deployment of troops in Washington DC.Gallup’s August survey reported that 40% of Americans approve of Trump’s performance, while 56% disapprove. RealClearPolitics put his net approval margin at minus five points at the end of August, and The New York Times tracker showed minus eight.These figures keep Trump below the first-year ratings of earlier presidents such as Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Ronald Reagan. Public approval stood at 49% for Joe Biden in August 2021, 36% for Donald Trump in August 2017, 53% for Barack Obama in August 2009, and 56% for George W Bush in August 2001. The highest in the list was George HW Bush, who recorded a massive 69% in August 1989.Public opinion has also been negative on key policy areas. A Reuters/Ipsos poll found only 38% of Americans supported his move to deploy the National Guard in Washington, while 46% opposed it. His immigration policies had 43% approval, and only 37% supported his handling of the economy.Trade has been another sticking point. An Economist/YouGov survey showed that 52% of Americans believe Trump has gone too far with tariffs.","US president Donald Trump has a low approval rating, according to recent surveys by Gallup, Reuters/Ipsos and other pollsters.

Commuters vent frustration

WFH in Gurgaon





NEW DELHI: Heavy rainfall brought large parts of Gurgaon, on the outskirts of Delhi, to a standstill on Monday, with waterlogged roads and vehicle breakdowns causing severe traffic congestion across the city.The district traffic police said it received nearly 200 distress calls by 7.30 pm from residents seeking assistance with stalled vehicles, breakdowns and guidance on alternative routes.Major gridlock was reported along the Delhi-Jaipur Expressway (NH-48), particularly near Rajiv Chowk, where pumps were deployed to drain flooded stretches. Congestion was also reported at Narsinghpur, Hero Honda Chowk, IFFCO Chowk and near the Kherki Daula toll plaza.A video shared widely on social media platform X showed the NH-48 choked with vehicles following the downpour.Sunidhi Sharma, who was stuck on NH-48, said: “Usually it takes me around 20 minutes to reach Shankar Chowk from Atlas Chowk, but today it took me around 90 minutes. The roads are broken, there are multiple bottlenecks, and authorities work only on paper. Nothing changes.”Similarly, IT professional Niharika Singh said, “What usually takes 20 minutes from my office in Cyber City to home in Sector 14 took one-and-a-half hours today.The entire expressway was packed, and traffic was crawling.”On X, one user wrote, “To the educated elite residing in Gurugram (erstwhile Gurgaon) — what compels you to endure perennial waterlogging, fractured infrastructure, and scarce cleanliness? This enigma I cannot decipher nor comprehend.”Another, Aparajita Bharti, criticised what she called the city’s complacency: “This is the same Gurgaon that mobilised quickly to save the dogs (good), but doesn't have it in itself to protest living like dogs after paying crores of rupees to live in this city. The cycle repeats every year. It is both sad and tiring. Father let my country awake.”Others described how the city ground to a halt. “Gurgaon was on a standstill. Thanks to our administration & failed governance. People were stuck in traffic for hours. Some booked hotels 2 avoid traffic madness. Some stayed at their friend’s house,” said another.The District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) issued an advisory on Monday night urging private offices and institutions to shift to remote working, while schools were asked to conduct online classes on Tuesday.Officials said the measures, prompted by an orange weather alert, were aimed at reducing traffic snarls, ensuring public safety and minimising disruption after the city received more than 100mm of rain between 3pm and 8pm.The advisory also urged residents to remain indoors wherever possible and to avoid non-essential travel.Copies of the order were circulated through the District Information and Public Relations Office, while education officers were tasked with ensuring compliance across government and private schools.Emergency services, officials added, remain on standby as authorities continue to assess the situation.","Heavy rainfall brought large parts of Gurgaon, on the outskirts of Delhi, to a standstill on Monday.

A notice directs Jarange to vacate the grounds due to disruptions, property damage, and unauthorized activities.





MUMBAI: The Mumbai Police have formally rejected a fresh application submitted by Maratha quota activist Manoj Jarange Patil’s associates seeking permission to continue their indefinite agitation at Azad Maidan, citing repeated violations of rules and interim directions of the Bombay High Court.The Mumbai Police on Tuesday issued a notice to Maratha quota activist Manoj Jarange Patil directing him to vacate the Azad Maidan grounds where he and his supporters have been staging a protest for the past four days.Also read: Mumbai Maratha Quota Protest News Live Updates Police officials said the notice also seeks an explanation from Jarange over multiple violations allegedly committed by his supporters during the agitation.These include traffic disruptions, damage to public property, and unauthorized activities within the protest site.In a notice addressed to core committee members of Jarange and his supporters police stated not to agitate at Azad Maidan without proper permission and to restrict such protests to Kharghar, Navi Mumbai.Despite this, Jarange and his supporters launched a hunger strike at Azad Maidan on August 29 with nearly 40,000 protestors and around 11,000 vehicles entering South Mumbai, leading to massive congestion. Over 5,000 vehicles were allegedly parked illegally around the High Court, Mantralaya, railway stations and key arterial roads, disrupting access to hospitals, courts and government offices.The notice states that the protest continued beyond the one-day permission granted for August 29 and that senior citizens were brought to the venue, one of whom threatened suicide.Police also referred to an attempted self-immolation by a protestor, the gathering of almost 40,000 people despite permission for only 5,000, the use of loudspeakers without approval, cooking, bathing and defecating in public areas, and road blockades at CSMT, Churchgate and other junctions.Authorities further pointed to provocative statements made by activists threatening to bring “5 crore Marathas” to Mumbai if their demands were not met.On Jarange’s protest at Azad Maidan, the High Court observed that it was for the state to decide the course of action. Since Jarange had prima facie violated the conditions of the permission granted by the state government and did not hold any valid permission to continue the protest at Azad Maidan, the court said the state should follow due procedure laid down in law for initiating appropriate steps.Citing serious disruption to public health, order and safety, the Mumbai Police declared the continuation of the agitation illegal, rejected the September 1 application for fresh permission, and directed the group to vacate Azad Maidan immediately.","Mumbai Police reject Maratha quota activist Manoj Jarange Patil's plea to continue his agitation at Azad Maidan.

Indonesia Erupts: Deadliest Riots in 20 Years Force Prabowo Into Retreat Amid Mass Protests

Jakarta on edge





At least 20 people remain missing in Indonesia following days of violent protests over lavish perks for lawmakers that have spiralled into broader anger against police, a rights group said Tuesday.The Commission for the Disappeared and Victims of Violence (KontraS) said it had received 23 reports of missing persons as of September 1.“After the search and verification process, 20 missing persons remain unfound,” the group said in a statement, according to AFP. The cases were reported in Bandung, Depok, and across Jakarta’s administrative regions.At least six people have been killed since the unrest began last week. Tensions escalated further after a young delivery driver was shot dead by a paramilitary police unit despite not being involved in the clashes.The United Nations has called for an investigation into allegations of excessive force. The unrest has already forced President Prabowo Subianto into a rare policy reversal on lawmakers’ perks, marking the most serious challenge to his presidency since taking office in October 2024.On Monday, the military was deployed in Jakarta as hundreds of protesters massed outside parliament. Authorities set up checkpoints, conducted joint police–army patrols, and stationed snipers at key sites. The normally congested capital saw lighter traffic, with schools, universities, and civil offices shifting online or remote until at least Tuesday.Elsewhere, clashes spread nationwide: protesters threw Molotov cocktails and firecrackers at the council building in Bandung, while violent confrontations erupted in Gorontalo on Sulawesi. Thousands rallied in Palembang on Sumatra, and hundreds more marched in Banjarmasin (Borneo), Yogyakarta (Java), and Makassar (Sulawesi).",At least six people have been killed since the unrest began last week.

NYC Labour Day ‘Bloodbath’: Gunman Goes Berserk, ‘Stabs’ & Opens Fire At West Indian Parade





NEW YORK: At least six people were shot and another was stabbed in separate incidents following the West Indian Day Parade in Brooklyn on Monday, the New York Police Department (NYPD) said.The violence occurred across four locations in Crown Heights between late afternoon and early evening as parade crowds dispersed, reported to Fox News 5.No arrests have been made so far.The first shooting occurred around 5.35 pm near 1098 Eastern Parkway, where a woman in her 40s was grazed in the back and a man in his 20s was shot in the leg.

'Trump Is Dead' Trend: White House Responds With 'All Is Well' Message | Details





A 50-year-old woman, who was locked up after making a series of disturbing social media posts threatening to kill Donald Trump, was quietly released by the judge, whom the US president hates.Last week, chief US district judge James Boasberg released Nathalie Rose Jones, a resident of Big Apple under electronic monitoring. The Obama-appointed judge also ordered her to see a psychiatrist once back home.The decision came less than a week after US magistrate judge Moxila Upadhyaya had denied bond, citing Jones's persistent threats.In a Facebook post on August 6, Jones allegedly wrote that she was ""willing to sacrificially kill this POTUS by disemboweling him and cutting out his trachea,"" and claimed to have alerted FBI offices across five states. Other posts urged defence secretary Pete Hegseth to coordinate Trump's ""arrest and removal"" at the White House.Jones later told Secret Service agents in an August 15 interview that she would ""carry out the mission"" with a ""bladed object"" if given the chance, according to court filings.Friends of Jones said she has long struggled with schizophrenia and other mental health issues, but has never acted violently. Boasberg ordered her to remain under strict monitoring while awaiting trial.Her arrest was announced earlier this month by new DC US attorney Jeanine Pirro, who vowed aggressive prosecution. ""Threatening the life of the President is one of the most serious crimes and one that will be met with swift and unwavering prosecution,"" Pirro said.","Nathalie Rose Jones, 50, was locked up after making a series of disturbing social media posts threatening to kill Donald Trump.

Katchatheevu row: Sri Lankan president 'inspects' island; makes unscheduled visit days after actor-politician Vijay's remarks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/katchatheevu-row-sri-lankan-president-inspects-island-makes-unscheduled-visit-days-after-actor-politician-vijays-remarks/articleshow/123645707.cms,"Image released by Sri Lankan President's office





Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake made an unannounced visit to Katchatheevu island on Monday, just days after actor-turned-politician Vijay’s remarks about the island reignited debate over its status. Once claimed by both India and Sri Lanka, the dispute over Katchatheevu was formally resolved in 1974, with New Delhi relinquishing its claim.A statement from the Sri Lankan President’s Office described the visit as an “inspection” following a day of development activities in Jaffna.“Following his participation today in a series of inauguration and development programmes in Jaffna, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake undertook an inspection visit to Katchatheevu Island,” according to the statement “Minister of Fisheries, Aquatic and Ocean Resources, Ramalingam Chandrasekar, Minister of Public Security and Parliamentary Affairs Ananda Wijepala and Rear Admiral Buddhika Liyanagamage, Commander Northern Naval Area also joined the President on this visit,” it added.The visit comes amid renewed focus on fishermen’s rights in the region. A 1976 treaty between India and Sri Lanka prohibits fishermen from either country from entering the other's territorial waters — a policy that has long been a point of friction, particularly among Tamil Nadu’s fishing communities, who often face arrests or confrontations by the Sri Lankan Navy.It was against this backdrop that actor and Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) leader Vijay, who launched his party in February 2024, raised the issue during a political rally in Madurai on August 21, directly targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi.""Nearly 800 fishermen have suffered due to attacks by the Sri Lankan Navy. I am not asking you to do anything big to condemn this. Please do something very small. Retrieve Katchatheevu from Sri Lanka at least now for our fishermen's safety. That would be enough,"" Vijay said.In response, Sri Lanka’s foreign minister Vijitha Herath dismissed the remarks as ""poll-time rhetoric.""“Elections are slated to be held in South India, and candidates will make various statements on the election stage to obtain votes. This is not the first time. Even in the past, similar claims have been made during election campaigns,” Herath said at a weekly press briefing in Colombo, while reaffirming Sri Lanka’s sovereignty over the island.Tamil Nadu is scheduled to hold assembly elections in April-May 2026, making Katchatheevu a potentially significant political talking point in the months ahead.",Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake made an unannounced visit to Katchatheevu island on Monday.

The event is being organised by Representatives Ro Khanna, a Democrat from California, and Thomas Massie, a Republican from Kentucky.Khanna says the victims’ testimonies could be “explosive” as many of them have never spoken publicly before. ""When Epstein got that lenient plea deal, no one talked to the victims or their lawyers,"" Khanna said Monday in a Fox News interview.Khanna further said “people are going to be outraged” after the press conference. “My belief is, when the American people actually hear the victims for the first time, they are going to sympathise, their hearts are going to be broken, and all the victims are saying is for closure,” he said.The Democrat added that the accounts would increase pressure on lawmakers to support a bill requiring the Justice Department to release the files.The two lawmakers need 218 signatures to advance the measure. With all 212 Democrats backing the effort, only six Republicans are needed, Khanna told NBC news.The Epstein case has created divisions within Republican ranks. US president Donald Trump’s administration has faced criticism including from his MAGA supporters for attempting to close the matter, despite earlier fuelling expectations of major disclosures.Meanwhile, the House Oversight Committee has subpoenaed Epstein’s estate as part of an inquiry into possible mishandling of a federal investigation involving him and Ghislaine Maxwell. Epstein died by suicide in a New York prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Maxwell was later convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison.","10 victims of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein will be held on Wednesday at the US Capitol.

Planes stopped at 2:30 AM: Judge halts flights carrying Guatemalan children; orders to let them stay in the US for now,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/planes-stopped-at-230-am-judge-halts-flights-carrying-guatemalan-children-orders-to-let-them-stay-in-the-us-for-now/articleshow/123627607.cms,".

Judge received a call at 2:30 AM





A federal judge on Sunday temporarily halted aircraft carrying migrant children who were waiting on tarmacs to be deported to their home country of Guatemala. The judge sided with the children's lawyers, who said the government was violating the law and putting their clients in danger.From tarmacs in Texas to a courthouse in Washington, the astonishing drama unfolded over the course of one holiday weekend. It marked the most recent conflict over the Trump administration's immigration crackdown and the most recent conflict between the administration's enforcement actions and the legal protections Congress established for vulnerable migrants.The judge claimed that she was woken up at 2:30 in the morning to respond to the children's attorneys' urgent filing, in which they bolded the fact that flights might be departing in the next two to four hours. According to her, Sooknanan tried to acquire answers from government attorneys for hours.At the midday hearing, Sooknanan stated, ""It is surprising that the government is trying to remove unaccompanied minors from the country in the early hours of the morning on a holiday weekend."" She went on to say, ""If the courts hadn't taken action, all of those children would have been sent back to Guatemala, possibly to very dangerous situations.""Five charter buses arrived at a plane at Valley International Airport, a deportation flight hub in Harlingen, Texas, minutes after her hurriedly planned hearing. Authorities had escorted scores of people, possibly as many as fifty, toward the aircraft in a section designated for government aircraft just hours before. The passengers were dressed in colorful attire, which is customary in government-run shelters for children of migrants.“I do not want there to be any ambiguity,"" stated U.S. District Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan.According to the verdict, Guatemalan youngsters who came to the border without their parents or guardians will remain there for at least two weeks while the legal battle is being fought.All 76 of the children aboard the planes should have been moved to shelters supervised by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services by the end of Sunday, the Justice Department said in a court filing.Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, wrote a letter on Friday stating that the Trump administration intends to deport about 700 Guatemalan children who entered the country unaccompanied.","Judge received a call at 2:30 AM that flights might be departing in the next two to four hours.

Visas revoked for Palestinian officials ahead of UN meeting



National security argument







In a latest move, US on Sunday said that it has suspended visa approvals for nearly everyone who holds a Palestinian passport, according to a news report from the New York Times.This sweeping measure could affect medical patients, students, and business travellers..The decision, which goes significantly further than earlier restrictions under Donald Trump's administration, has sparked criticism from pro-Palestinian groups. Two weeks ago, the state department said it was halting all visitor visas for individuals from Gaza while conducting a ""full and thorough"" review.On Friday, the US began denying and revoking visas for members of the Palestinian Authority (PA) and Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) ahead of the United Nations General Assembly in September, according to the state department.While the US is required as host nation to grant entry for foreign officials attending the UN in New York, officials said they were complying with those obligations by permitting the Palestinian mission to attend, but revoking individual visas for PLO and PA members outside that scope.""The Trump administration has been clear: it is in our national security interests to hold the PLO and PA accountable for not complying with their commitments, and for undermining the prospects for peace,"" the state department said in a statement.The measure marks another step by Washington to align itself with Israel's right-wing government, which opposes Palestinian statehood. Critics say the suspension of visas amounts to collective punishment and undermines Palestinians' ability to engage internationally.","US has suspended visa approvals for nearly everyone who holds a Palestinian passport.

The bruise that wouldn’t fade

Makeup, cameras, and awkward excuses

The ankle twist

Experts weigh in





A bruise on the hand of a 79-year-old man wouldn’t normally make headlines, unless that man is Donald Trump, the president who campaigned in 2024 on being sharper, stronger, and healthier than Joe Biden What began as a curious blotch on his hand has spiraled into months of speculation, with the White House offering shifting explanations that have only deepened doubts about Trump’s health.The saga began on February 24, 2025, when a Getty photographer snapped Trump greeting French President Emmanuel Macron.The close-up revealed a dark bruise smeared with makeup, clumsily concealed but unmistakable.Observers soon realized the mark had been visible as far back as spring 2024, when Trump himself dismissed it as the byproduct of “overzealous handshakes.”“A woman gripped my hand so hard, the Secret Service had to step in,” Trump told the Washington Examiner in 2024. He repeated the story to Time magazine later that year.But as the bruise lingered into 2025, the explanation began to unravel.By summer, Trump was regularly spotted with mismatched concealer caked on his hand.A C-SPAN cameraman zoomed in on the blotchy makeup during a July press event, sparking fresh scrutiny.The White House doubled down, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt calling the bruise nothing more than “soft tissue irritation” from endless handshakes and daily aspirin.Then came the curveball. At the FIFA Club World Cup Final in New Jersey on July 13, Trump was photographed with swollen ankles. Days later, the White House abandoned the handshake defense and admitted the president had been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), a vascular condition common in older adults that hampers blood flow from the legs to the heart.Trump’s doctor, Sean Barbabella, assured reporters there was “no evidence of heart failure or serious illness.” But crucial details about treatment remain undisclosed, with Leavitt insisting, “You see the president every day, he’s working, he’s moving, he’s continuing.”Not everyone is convinced the story adds up. Dr Peter Henke, a former chair of the American Heart Association’s vascular council, told New York Magazine that the bruising on Trump’s hand is “unrelated to venous insufficiency.” Instead, Henke suggested, aspirin use could explain the unusual bruising.The White House has not allowed Dr Barbabella to face questions directly, despite earlier promising transparency.","Donald Trump, 79, was photographed with a bruise on his hand in February 2025.

GENEVA: The International Labour Organisation (ILO) is assessing the impact of a $107 million funding cut proposed by the Trump administration to the Geneva-based UN agency, according to an internal message reviewed by Reuters.Staff at the ILO, which promotes international labour rights, told Reuters there are fears of further job cuts as the US, which contributes 22% of the ILO’s regular budget, seeks to row back on funding.President Donald Trump has moved to unilaterally cancel $4.9 billion in foreign aid authorised by Congress for a number of international programmes, including a $107 million cut to the ILO, a White House statement said on Friday.In the internal note sent to staff, ILO director-general Gilbert F Houngbo said he lacks “full clarity” on the cut’s implications. The ILO told Reuters that it is in contact with the US administration to seek more detail. Houngbo told staff that the US, the agency’slargest donor, had yet to pay its 2024 and 2025 dues. The ILO’s $930 million total 2-year budget for 2026-2027 was approved in June.","The International Labour Organisation (ILO) is assessing the impact of a $107 million funding cut proposed by the Trump administration to the UN agency.

US President Donald Trump on Monday announced that Rudy Giuliani , the former New York City mayor and longtime ally, will receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honour.Trump made the announcement on Truth Social, calling Giuliani ""the greatest Mayor in the history of New York City"" and ""an equally great American Patriot."" He added that details of the ceremony would be shared later.The announcement came just a day after Giuliani was seriously injured in a car crash in New Hampshire. His spokesman, Michael Ragusa, said the 80-year-old former mayor had pulled over to assist a woman fleeing domestic violence and had helped her call 911. After leaving the scene, Giuliani's rental car was struck from behind at high speed on the highway.He was hospitalised with multiple injuries, including a fractured thoracic vertebrae, contusions, and injuries to his left arm and lower leg. Ragusa said Monday that Giuliani's condition is improving and that he is expected to be discharged in the coming days.""This is a man who survived 9/11—so a little car accident won't be slowing him down,"" Ragusa said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""He is eager to return to business and continue fighting for this country, as he has proudly done for the past 50 years.""Giuliani, who served as mayor of New York City from 1994 to 2001, rose to national prominence for his leadership following the September 11 attacks.

Filmmaker Woody Allen has said he wishes to direct US president Donald Trump again, more than two decades after casting him in the 1998 film Celebrity.Speaking on Bill Maher’s “Club Random” podcast, Allen, called Trump “a pleasure to work with” and described him as “very professional and charismatic” in front of the camera.“I’m one of the few people who can say he directed Trump. I directed Trump,” Allen recalled. “He was a pleasure to work with and a very good actor. He was very polite, hit his mark, did everything correctly and had a real flair for show business. I could direct him now. If he would let me direct him now that he’s president, I think I could do wonders,” Allen said.Trump had a cameo in Celebrity, playing himself in a short scene about real estate.The director, however, made clear that he did not support Trump politically. He said he voted for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election and disagrees with “99%” of Trump’s views.Allen added that he was surprised Trump chose politics at all, given his earlier interests in sports, golf and beauty contests. He said, “I’m surprised he wanted to go into politics. Politics is nothing but headaches and critical decisions and agony.This was a guy I used to see at the Knick games, and he liked to play golf, and he liked to judge beauty contests and he liked to do things that were enjoyable and relaxing. Why anyone would want to suddenly have to deal with the issues of politics is beyond me. ”Despite his differences, Allen summed up Trump’s acting in positive terms, saying he was ""pleasant to work, and very professional, very polite to everyone. Very, you know, as I say, I would like to direct him now as president and let me make the decisions.

US President Donald Trump is touting an unlikely alliance with Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser, crediting her cooperation with his administration for what he calls a stunning collapse in the capital’s crime rates.“Wow! Mayor Muriel Bowser of DC has become very popular because she worked with me and my great people in bringing crime down to virtually nothing in DC,” Trump posted on Truth Social.Trump claimed Bowser’s approval rating has surged 25% since the crackdown began, framing her as a contrast to Democratic governors like Illinois’s JB Pritzker and California’s Gavin Newsom, whom he accused of “justifying violent crime.”Calling DC “a crime-free zone,” Trump credited “hard work, courage, and being smart”, and said his early use of troops had prevented Los Angeles from losing the Olympics during riots and wildfires. “Congratulations to Mayor Muriel Bowser,” he added, “but don’t go woke on us. DC is a giant victory that never has to end!!!”Bowser, for her part, touted dramatic drops in carjackings, robberies, and gun crimes since the federal surge began.“Carjackings are down 87%, violent crime is down 45%, arrests are up 20%, and illegal gun recoveries are up 12%,” she said last week. “We know that when carjackings go down, when the use of guns goes down, when homicide or robbery go down, neighborhoods feel safer and are safer.”Attorney General Pam Bondi added that nearly 1,600 arrests have been made and 165 illegal guns seized since the operation started.The apparent partnership may not end in Washington. Trump has already threatened to deploy National Guard troops to other Democratic-run cities to impose the same brand of federal crackdown.","US President Donald Trump is touting an unlikely alliance with Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser.

Eric Trump erupted online, raging against what he called “twisted” rumors about his father’s health after speculation spiraled over the US president’s four-day disappearance from the public eye.The president’s third child with his late first wife, Ivana, accused political opponents of deliberately spreading “death” rumors to damage his father. “This is the left at its absolute worst,” Eric fumed, reposting his father’s defiant Truth Social message declaring, “NEVER FELT BETTER IN MY LIFE.”But critics were quick to throw his own words back at him. In 2020, Eric repeatedly questioned Joe Biden ’s fitness, warning about his “cognitive decline” during the presidential race. His father later amplified conspiracy theories suggesting Biden had been replaced by “clones” and “robotic engineered entities.”The meltdown came as Trump’s health has drawn intense scrutiny. The 79-year-old has been photographed with swollen ankles, bruised hands, and an unsteady gait. Earlier this year, the White House acknowledged he suffers from chronic venous insufficiency, a circulatory condition, and attributed the bruising to aspirin use and excessive hand-shaking.Even allies have added fuel. Vice President JD Vance, while insisting Trump was fit, recently said he was ready to step in if a “terrible tragedy” befell the president, comments that only stoked speculation.Meanwhile, far-right activist Nick Fuentes compared the situation to what he claimed was a Biden “cover-up,” declaring on X, “There is obviously something going on with Trump… This is literally Biden 2.”","Eric Trump rages against what he calls ""twisted"" rumors about his father's health.
