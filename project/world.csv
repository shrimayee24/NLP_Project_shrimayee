In their joint statement, they twice underscored the need to prevent escalation and spilling over of the conflict in the region.India Monday issued an advisory asking Indian nationals in Lebanon to exercise caution after Israel threatened action against Hezbollah for a Golan Heights attack that left 12 children dead.While discussing global and regional issues, the Quad meeting also focused on the war in Ukraine and terrorism , naming Pakistan based terror groups like LeT and JeM and seeking action without delay against the perpetrators of Mumbai and Pathankot attacks.On Ukraine, for the second time in 2 years the ministers expressed their deepest concern over the “tragic and terrible” humanitarian consequences of the war as they called upon all states to not use force against sovereignty, territorial integrity and “political independence” of any state.At a media event later in the day, Jaishankar defended India’s position on the war saying India believes there won’t be a “decisive outcome” from the battlefield and it’s important for countries in touch with both parties to remain active and do whatever they can to move the action from the battlefield to the conference table. While he didn’t confirm whether PM Narendra Modi will visit Ukraine in August, Jaishankar said he “reasonably” expected more Indian contact with both Ukraine and Russia.There was substantial focus in the joint statement on West Asia as the ministers said they shared great interest in achieving peace and stability in the region, and called for an end to any action that could undermine the prospects of a 2-state solution, including Israeli expansion of settlements and violent extremism on all sides.According to the joint statement, the ministers reiterated commitment to a sovereign, viable and independent Palestinian state “taking into account Israel’s legitimate security concerns as part of a two-state solution that enables both Israelis and Palestinians to live in a just, lasting, and secure peace”.They also unequivocally condemned the terror attacks on October 7, 2023, by Hamas, while describing as unacceptable the large-scale loss of civilian lives and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.“We affirm the imperative of securing the release of all hostages held by Hamas, and emphasize that the deal to release hostages would bring an immediate and prolonged ceasefire in Gaza,” said the joint statement, stressing the need to significantly increase deliveries of life-saving humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza and to comply with international humanitarian law. The ministers urged countries in the Indo-Pacific too to increase their efforts to address the “dire humanitarian need on the ground”.Quad also condemned ongoing attacks by the Houthis against commercial vessels transiting through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. “These attacks destabilize the region, impede navigational rights and freedoms, and trade flows, and jeopardize the safety of vessels and people on board including sailors,” said the ministers.",Quad calls for parties concerned to work for release of all hostages and immediate ceasefire.

The satellite, fitted with a new "" liquid oxygen and petroleum engine ,"" exploded minutes after liftoff, raising suspicions about the origin of the technology.The NIS informed lawmakers that there were no signs North Korea had developed the liquid oxygen and kerosene engine. Lee Seong-kweun, a member of the parliamentary intelligence committee, stated, ""Given that liquid oxygen and kerosene were used in the engine for the first time, they had likely received Russian support.""The NIS disclosed that Russia had also assisted North Korea in its successful launch of a reconnaissance satellite in November, which occurred two months after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited Russia. During this visit, President Vladimir Putin had promised to help North Korea build satellites.Putin reciprocated with a visit to Pyongyang in June, during which both nations signed a ""comprehensive strategic partnership"" pact. While both Russia and North Korea have denied engaging in arms transactions, they have vowed to enhance military cooperation.Additionally, Lee mentioned that Kim Jong Un's daughter, Ju Ae, is being groomed to become the next leader of North Korea, based on information provided by the NIS. Although North Korea's state media has reported on her public activities, there have been no official statements about her political future.Another parliamentary intelligence committee member, Park Sun-won, noted that the NIS stated the recent indictment of Sue Mi Terry in the United States had no impact on intelligence cooperation between Washington and Seoul. Terry, a foreign policy expert previously with the CIA and the White House National Security Council, was indicted earlier this month on charges of acting as an unregistered agent for the South Korean government in exchange for luxury goods and other gifts.Park said, ""The NIS said they're working hard to learn a lesson from this. But there are no major problems with intelligence cooperation between the two countries, and it is actually expanding.""The indictment came at a surprising time, as Presidents Joe Biden and Yoon Suk Yeol have been strengthening security partnerships.

""This just wasn’t the right time for North Carolina and for me to potentially be on a national ticket,” Cooper said in a statement. “Harris has an outstanding list of people from which to choose, and we’ll all work to make sure she wins"", according to AP.Harris' search for a running mate is ongoing, with her team of lawyers and political aides reviewing a narrowing list of candidates. Initially, about a dozen contenders were under consideration, but the focus has now shifted to Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro and Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, who are seen as front-runners.Cooper, the former chairman of the Democratic governors association, has a longstanding relationship with Harris dating back to their time as state attorneys general. His potential selection was viewed as advantageous for shifting North Carolina — a critical state for Democrats — into Harris' favour.Under North Carolina's state constitution, lieutenant governor Mark Robinson , a Republican and the GOP nominee to replace the term-limited Cooper, would assume the governor's powers when Cooper travels out of state. Cooper's concerns about Robinson's potential actions in his absence played a significant role in his decision to withdraw. Robinson is known for his ardent social conservative views, including calling abortion ""child sacrifice"" and making derogatory remarks about LGBTQ+ individuals.In the weeks leading up to President Joe Biden 's withdrawal from the race, Cooper appeared alongside Harris at campaign events in Greensboro and Fayetteville. He has remained discreet about the vetting process, recently stating, “I trust her to make the right decision.”The New York Times first reported Cooper's withdrawal, but did not detail the timing or rationale.

This event is part of a series of Zoom meetings designed to raise funds and rally support for vice president Harris.President Biden had previously announced he was leaving the presidential race and endorsing Harris.The event featured appearances from actors Mark Ruffalo, Mark Hamill, and Bradley Whitford. Democratic officials such as transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, and Illinois governor JB Pritzker also participated. The virtual gatherings have been organised by supporters' backgrounds, including Black women, Hispanic women, Black men, Asian Americans, Native Americans, and the LGBTQ+ community.Jeff Bridges praised Harris and humorously channeled his role as 'The Dude' from the 1998 film 'The Big Lebowski,' saying, ""As the Dude might say, 'That's just my opinion, man.'""Organisers noted that the call was another example of how Democrats, including Biden, have historically relied on diverse voter groups to build coalitions of support. Biden's 2020 victory, for example, relied on organised labor and conservative suburban women disillusioned with Donald Trump.'White dudes' Zoom events have become a part of this trend, also featuring comments from participants like Bradley Whitford, who dryly remarked on the event's numerous white male speakers as 'a rainbow of beige.' JB Pritzker joked about his initial hesitation to attend an event called 'White Dudes for' something, while Pete Buttigieg expressed his honor in sharing a virtual platform with Jeff Bridges and emphasised the importance of men's freedom in a country with access to abortion rights.""Men are also more free in a country where we have a president who stands up for things like access to abortion rights.""Gov. Walz pointed out that Trump supporters aren't inherently bad people and urged: ""Don't ever shy away from our progressive values. One person's socialism is another person's neighborliness.""Ross Morales Rocketto, the progressive operative who founded the 'dudes' group, highlighted that not all white men are supporters of the Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement. ""We know that the silent majority of white men aren't MAGA supporters,"" he said.Although Harris' team has not organised these Zoom calls, they welcome the support and fundraising efforts. ""Winning campaigns are powered by real, organic support,"" said Harris campaign communications director Michael Tyler.Harris' calls often feature celebrities who have previously supported Biden's campaign. For example, the political networking group 'Win With Black Women' saw its participants swell to over 44,000 on the same night that Biden dropped out. This event featured celebratory speeches from activists, business leaders, and members of Congress.Following that, a 'Win With Black Men' virtual fundraising event attracted more than 53,000 attendees, including Democratic Rep. Maxwell Frost of Florida and Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock. A Zoom event for 'White Women for Harris' also drew over 164,000 participants and featured personalities such as singer Pink, soccer star Megan Rapinoe, and actor Connie Britton.The efforts to organize supporters by their distinct backgrounds are not unique to Harris' campaign. Trump's campaign has also organised events aimed at different groups, such as Black voters in battleground states like Pennsylvania and Georgia, as well as 'Latino Americans for Trump.'Some Republicans have criticised Harris for her 'diversity, equality and inclusion politics,' arguing that her political career has been aided by Democratic efforts to promote diversity. However, House Speaker Mike Johnson and other GOP leaders have discouraged lines of criticism they consider racist and sexist, urging party members to focus their criticisms on her political record.","The call, which took place on Monday night, saw over 123,000 participants and raised more than $3.3 million.

PM Netanyahu and his defence minister Yoav Gallant got the authorisation from the cabinet members in a meeting Sunday night.Visiting the scene of the strike Monday, Netanyahu said of the victims: ""These children are our children, the children of all of us.Israel will not and cannot let this pass and carry on as usual. Our response is coming, and it will be severe."" Israeli politicians have been vocal about the need for a significant military blow in retaliation for the rocket strike, which killed 12 children and teenagers Saturday in the Druse Arab village of Majdal Shams in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights. The Iran-backed militia group Hezbollah , which has been sending rockets into Israel for months, denied responsibility for the attack, but Israel and the US have blamed the group.Israeli analysts said Hezbollah was most likely aiming at a nearby army base on Mount Hermon and did not intentionally target the village. But the group's use of inaccurate rockets in an area dotted with civilian communities led to the kind of unintended consequence that risks sparking an all-out war, they said.Analysts said they expect a more powerful Israeli retaliation for Saturday's rocket attack on Majdal Shams, but that Netanyahu was likely to calibrate the response so as not to prompt escalation into something closer to all-out war.Since the strike on Majdal Shams on Saturday, there have been continued exchanges across the border, but they have seemed to fall within the bounds of the routine tit-for-tat of the past few months. The Israeli military said overnight that its aerial defense systems successfully intercepted an unmanned aircraft that crossed from Lebanon into northwestern Israel. On Monday morning, a drone strike in southern Lebanon killed two people and injured three others, including a child, Lebanon's state-run news agency said.US secretary of state Antony Blinken, in a call from Tokyo Monday with Israeli Prez Isaac Herzog, ""reaffirmed the US' ironclad commitment to Israel's security against threats from Iranian-backed terrorist organisations, including Hezbollah.""

North Korea seek medicines from abroad for Kim Jong Un's health problems: Seoul,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/north-korea-seeks-medicines-for-kim-jong-uns-health-problems-seoul/articleshow/112117812.cms,"North Korean officials are seeking new medicines from abroad to treat their leader of North Korea Kim Jong Un who has reportedly regained weight and is now facing health issues related to obesity . Kim jong is reportedly suffering with conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes, according to South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS).At 40 years old, Kim has a family history of heart problems, with both his father and grandfather dying from heart-related issues. Known for his heavy drinking and smoking habits, Kim is approximately 170 centimeters (5 feet, 8 inches) tall and previously weighed 140 kilograms (308 pounds). Despite appearing to have lost a significant amount of weight in 2021, possibly due to dietary changes, recent state media footage suggests he has regained the lost weight, reported AP.Lawmaker Lee Seong Kweun stated that the NIS estimates Kim's current weight to be around 140 kilograms (308 pounds), placing him in a high-risk group for heart disease. ""Kim has shown symptoms of high blood pressure and diabetes since his early 30s,"" Lee said. Lawmaker Park Sunwon added that the NIS believes Kim's obesity is linked to his drinking, smoking, and stress.The NIS also informed lawmakers that North Korean officials have been attempting to procure new medicines from abroad to address Kim's suspected high blood pressure and diabetes.Kim's health is a topic of significant interest beyond North Korea's borders, as he has not formally named a successor, raising concerns about who would take charge of the country's growing nuclear arsenal in the event of his incapacitation.During Monday's briefing, the NIS reiterated its assessment that Kim's preteen daughter, reportedly named Kim Ju Ae, appears to be bolstering her status as her father's heir apparent. However, the NIS noted that it cannot entirely rule out the possibility that one of her siblings could replace her as the successor, given that she has not been officially designated as her father's successor.Speculation about Kim Ju Ae, who is about 10 years old, began to spread when she started accompanying her father to high-profile public events in late 2022. State media have referred to her as Kim Jong Un's ""most beloved"" or ""respected"" child and have released numerous photos and footage showcasing her increasing political prominence and her close relationship with her father. The NIS reported to lawmakers that at least 60% of Kim Ju Ae's public appearances have involved being present at military events with her father.","North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has reportedly regained weight and is now facing health issues related to obesity.

Another key demand in the motion was to write to PM Starmer to convey “deep concerns at UK intelligence reports of Indian govt agencies targeting Sikh activists in Slough”.Smith said he accepted that to some, it sounded like a pro-Sikh motion and to others, as “anti-Sikh, anti-Indian or even anti-Indian govt”. “It offers sympathy to victims of inter-communal violence in India in 1984, but also appears to ascribe motives and blame for actions that followed both,” Smith said.Proposer Akram defended her wording of the motion.“People in this chamber are safe to call the 1984 atrocities an act of genocide. It was also an accepted definition by the Indian PM (Narendra) Modi, no less. The fact that security agencies have contacted members of two families in Slough who are British citizens to say their lives are at risk demonstrates the real threat to our sovereignty as a country,” Akram said.Akram referred to the assassination of Khalistani separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Canada last year and the death of activist Avtar Singh Khanda in “mysterious circumstances” to contend that the issue of anti-Sikh transnational repression was “very real”.Nineteen councillors voted in favour of the challenge, eight against, two abstained and eight did not vote. This meant the challenge was upheld and the motion was treated as withdrawn.The fury followed soon after in the council’s public gallery and the meeting had to be adjourned whilst it was cleared of angry Sikhs. They shouted “never forget 1984 Sikh genocide”, “Shame on you” and accused the council of being supporters of genocide. Another screamed: “There are Sikhs in Slough under threat by the Indian govt. If they are murdered, you are all at fault.”The Sikh Federation UK said: “We wrote to the council leader in advance of the meeting and said preventing the motion from being debated was a direct attack on democratic British values and it would lead to community disharmony.”",The motion was proposed by councillor Sabia Akram who quit PM Keir Starmer’s Labour party this June over issues related to the war in Gaza.

North Korea 's Kim Jong Un has regained weight and is suffering from obesity-related health problems including high blood pressure and diabetes, and his officials are looking for new medicines abroad to treat them, South Korea's spy agency told lawmakers on Monday. The 40-year-old, known for heavy drinking and smoking, comes from a family with a history of heart problems.Observers said Kim appeared to have lost a large amount of weight in 2021, likely from changing his diet. But recent footage shows he has regained the weight. Kim's health is in focus since he hasn't formally anointed a successor. The National Intelligence Service, in its briefing, maintained its assessment that Kim's preteen daughter , reportedly named Kim Ju Ae, appears to be bolstering her status as her father's likely heir apparent.Polish divers have found a 19th-century shipwreck off the coast of Sweden laden with bottles of champagne, a ""very exclusive"" cargo they say may have been destined for the tsar of Russia before the vessel sank. They discovered the wreck, which also contains porcelain and bottles of mineral water, around 60m below the surface of Baltic Sea, but say they would need permission from Swedish authorities to bring the cargo to shore. If the divers get permission to remove some bottles, they will send them to the manufacturer to ascertain how much they may be worth and whether they are still drinkable.","'Bubbly' cargo found in 19th-century shipwreck off the coast of Sweden.

She was 93. O'Brien died Saturday after a long illness, said her publisher Faber and literary agency PFD.She is survived by her sons, Marcus and Carlos.O'Brien published over 20 books, most novels and story collections, and would know fully what she called the ""extremities of joy and sorrow, love, crossed love and unrequited love, success and failure, fame and slaughter."" Few so concretely and poetically challenged Ireland's religious, sexual and gender boundaries. Few wrote so fiercely, so sensually about loneliness, rebellion, desire and persecution.She befriended movie stars and heads of states while also writing sympathetically about Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams and meeting with farm workers in Nigeria who feared abduction by Boko Haram.O'Brien was an unknown about to turn 30, living with her husband and two children outside of London, when 'The Country Girls' made her Ireland's most notorious exile since James Joyce. Written in three weeks and published in 1960 for an advance of roughly $75, 'The Country Girls' follows the lives of two young women: Caithleen (Kate) Brady and Bridget (Baba) Brennan journey from a rural convent to the risks and adventures of Dublin. Admirers were as caught up in their defiance and awakening as would-be censors were enraged by passages as ""He opened his braces and let his trousers slip down around the ankles"" and ""He patted my knees with his other hand. I was excited and warm and violent."" Her novel was praised in London and New York while in Ireland it was labeled ""filth"" and burned publicly. Detractors included O'Brien's parents and husband, author Ernest Gebler, from whom she was already estranged.She continued the stories of Kate and Baba in 'The Lonely Girl' and 'Girls in Their Married Bliss' and by mid- 1960s was single and enjoying the prime of ""Swinging London"": whether socialising with Princess Margaret and Marianne Faithfull, or having a fling with actor Robert Mitchum. Paul McCartney once escorted her home, picked up her son's guitar and improvised a song with lines on O'Brien: ""She'll have you sighing/She'll have you crying/Hey/She'll blow your mind away.""O'Brien is among the most notable authors never to win the Nobel or the Booker Prize.

""And most recently and most shockingly, the Supreme Court established in Trump vs the United States a dangerous precedent,"" said Biden. ""They ruled, as you know, that the president of the United States has immunity for potential crimes he may have committed while in office, immunity.

However, these proposals have already met with opposition from Republican lawmakers. House Speaker Mike Johnson critiqued the proposed judicial reforms as ""dangerous"" and declared them ""dead on arrival in the House.""

Because it stands in their way,"" McConnell said.Biden also expressed support for Vice President Kamala Harris , who is now the leading Democratic candidate for the presidential nomination.
