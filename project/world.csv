Drone bomb attacks on civilians acts of terror: Manipur CM,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/drone-bomb-attacks-on-civilians-acts-of-terror-manipur-cm/articleshow/113046669.cms,"Security forces captured a drone at Kharam Vaiphei in Kangpokpi district late Monday, giving them a glimpse of what they are up against. Sources said the drones being used by militants are rotor-fitted quadcopters, known to be versatile UAVs that are usually acquired for photography and recreational flying.""Such drones can drop and trigger explosives, including grenades, and fly fast with a top speed of 250 kmph,"" an official said.""But weaponising a hobby drone and operating it for anything other than recreational purpose requires training. The fact that militants are able to do that is worrisome."" Drones can be remotely operated in a range of 500m to 5km. With slight modification, this range can be increased to 10-15km.""Drones first hit the Manipur skies during the conflict last year, albeit only for reconnaissance purposes. Such drones are readily available in open market for prices ranging from Rs 30,000 to Rs 2.5 lakh. They come in parts and can be assembled in three to four hours,"" experts said.Unprepared for aerial assaults and faced with need for adapting strategies to counter these advanced tools effectively, the DGP has formed a five-member committee to examine the use of drones by militants and find ways to effectively deal with them.Headed by state additional DGP (intelligence) Ashutosh Kumar Sinha, it includes GOC of Army's 57 Mountain Division, Maj Gen SS Kartikeya, Assam Rifles IG (South) Maj Gen Rabroop Singh, CRPF IG (Manipur and Nagaland) Vipul Kumar, and BSF's counter insurgency operations DIG in Manipur, JK Birdi.CM N Biren Singh denounced Tuesday ""all forms of violence"" and urged the people of the state to unite against hate, division, and separatism as he condemned the drone bomb attacks on civilians as acts of terrorism.","Drones first hit the Manipur skies during the conflict last year, albeit only for reconnaissance purposes.

"'Mamata can't hide her criminal intent': BJP slams West Bengal CM's new anti-rape law, accuses her of silencing media",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mamata-cant-hide-her-criminal-intent-bjp-slams-west-bengal-cms-new-anti-rape-law-accuses-her-of-silencing-media/articleshow/113023653.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) has launched a scathing attack on West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee following the introduction of the Aparajita woman and child bill (West Bengal criminal laws and amendment) bill 2024, a new anti-rape law passed by the state assembly.BJP national spokesperson Amit Malviya said that the new legislation seeks to curtail press freedom while diverting attention from the recent rape and murder of a young doctor at RG Kar Medical College & Hospital in Kolkata.Malviya in his X post accused Mamata Banerjee of attempting to ""hide her criminal intent "" behind the new law , claiming that it was a ""desperate attempt"" to shift focus away from the widespread protests that erupted after the tragic incident.He alleged that the law, under the guise of protecting women, includes provisions that would limit reporting on judicial proceedings in rape cases, effectively silencing the media.""Why is Mamata Banerjee trying to silence the media? So much for free speech and press freedom!"" Malviya tweeted, questioning the chief minister's sincerity in addressing crimes against women. He further called on Banerjee to take concrete actions if she truly aims to tackle these issues, including apologising to the women of Sandeshkhali for defending Sheikh Shahjahan, a rape accused, on the floor of the West Bengal Assembly, and ensuring that Shahjahan is the first to face the death penalty under the new law.Malviya's comments came in response to Banerjee's statements in the West Bengal Assembly, where she hit back at the BJP by citing high-profile rape cases in BJP-ruled states like Unnao and Hathras. Banerjee expressed disapproval of the central government's decision to pass the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) without consulting her state and criticized the central leadership, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah, for failing to implement effective laws to protect women.Taking it to X, Mamata Banerjee said, ""A society that cannot ensure the safety of its women can never be ideal. Today, GoWB passed the historic Aparajita anti-rape Bill to address pertinent issues caused by gaps in the existing criminal laws. Let us all unite together and address this menace collectively!""Union Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan Tuesday slammed the anti-rape bill passed in the West Bengal assembly as a ""diversionary tactic"" and asked if Shahjahan Sheikh, the main accused in the Sandeshkhali sexual abuse case, will get the death penalty under the proposed law. Talking to reporters, Chouhan, a senior BJP leader and the Union agriculture minister, accused West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee of being ""insensitive"" towards women.Chouhan said: ""Mamata Banerjee has become insensitive. Madhya Pradesh was the first state in the country to implement such a law in 2017, and so far, 42 people have been given the death sentence. The bill has been brought to divert attention from the heinous crime at RG Kar Medical College. Why didn't the Mamata government introduce the bill earlier? Those responsible for the RG Kar incident should receive the death penalty. Will people like Sheikh Shahjahan also face the death penalty under this bill?""Meanwhile, Union MoS and BJP leader Sukanta Majumdar said, ""Mamata Banerjee is doing 'dramabaazi'. The legislation brought today is unconstitutional. There is already a central law which has the provision of the death penalty. So the legislation brought by Mamata Banerjee today is only 'dramabaazi'. This legislation will be challenged in Supreme Court and it will be cancelled.""TMC leader Kunal Ghosh hailed the bill as a historic move by the Mamata Banerjee-led government to provide stringent punishment for rape and murder. ""History has been created in West Bengal legislative assembly. For the first time a bill has been passed by Mamata Banerjee led government to provide stringent punishment to those involved in incidents of rape and murder. The Governor of West Bengal should provide assent to the bill,"" Ghosh said.The new anti-rape bill introduced by Banerjee aims to expedite investigations, deliver swift justice, and impose stricter punishments, including the death penalty for those convicted of rape resulting in the victim's death or leaving her in a inhumane state.The bill also includes provisions for life imprisonment without parole for those convicted of rape and gang rape, as well as penalties for unauthorized publishing of court-related matters.The BJP has raised concerns over its potential impact on press freedom and transparency in judicial proceedings. Malviya urged Banerjee to remove the clause that seeks to limit media reporting on rape cases and called for the immediate establishment of fast-track courts to address crimes against women and minor girls.","BJP national spokesperson Amit Malviya said that the new legislation seeks to curtail press freedom while diverting attention from the recent rape and murder of a young doctor at RG Kar Medical College & Hospital in Kolkata.

There are contradictory accounts of what Queen Elizabeth II thought about former US president Donald Trump , his marriage with Melania . But now we know what Trump thought about the Queen. In his book Save America to be published on September 3, which is a collection of memorable photos from Trump's life, Trump wrote: ""They said I made the Queen happy, and I said, 'No she made me happy!"".This has been written next to a photo of Trump laughing with the late Queen.Recently, there was some controversy over Craig Brown's claim that the late Queen thought Trump was rude. Brown wrote in his book A Voyage Around the Queen that the Queen confided in a lunch guest that Trump was always looking over her shoulder as if he was looking for something more interesting. Brown claimed that the Queen also believed that Trump had some kind of an arrangement with Melania.Trump election campaign dismissed the claim and said it was a fake news intended to sell more copies of the book. ""This is nothing more than fake news intended to use made-up, salacious fabrications in order to sell copies of a book that belongs in the bargain bin of the fiction section,"" Steven Cheung, Trump's communications director said.In the wake of the 'rude' claim, Donald Trump told Daily Mail that it was just the opposite. He was her favorite president, Trump said claiming that Queen told that to many people. “We spent hours together at a state dinner. She was a fantastic woman. I think it’s a shame that a sleaze bag can write an article that’s totally false. In fact, I’ve heard always the opposite,"" Trump earlier commented.""While people thought I didn't get along with her, I did very much get along with her. She was a strong leader who made two mistakes on energy and allowing in more than one million aliens (migrants) into Germany.

MUMBAI: Nearly two weeks after it slammed the state and police over delayed action on the sexual assault of two minor girls at a Badlapur school, Bombay HC Tuesday frowned at the special investigation team (SIT) for not disclosing the efforts it has taken to nab the absconding accused. It was miffed on finding out that the case diary was written in ""stereotype words"" and rued that this is seen in every case.HC also cautioned the state against filing a chargesheet in a hurry, under public pressure. ""Ensure that the investigation is proper.""The SIT had earlier informed a Pocso court that the chairman, the principal and the secretary of school were wanted accused in the case.""We are not satisfied with the way the case is conducted so far as the absconding accused are concerned... We were expecting something [on Tuesday] in the case diary on what concrete steps have been taken,"" said a bench of Justices Revati Mohite-Dere and Prithviraj Chavan.On the case diary not having detailed accounts, Justice Chavan said, ""For more than 35 years, we have been seeing this... There should be a reflection in the case diary of every step which is taken. It doesn't...'' He said unlike a station diary, ""a case diary is between police and the court and the accused has no right to see it"".Advocate general Birendra Saraf said the SIT will prepare a report with details and hand it to the court. ""Since the formation of SIT, a great deal of effort has been put in.""Advocate general Birendra Saraf said “there is no attempt in any manner to protect anyone”. “One can read between the lines... What we are doing is on a common canvas and considering the outburst of the common man. The public is watching. What message we are giving...,” said Justice Chavan. Saraf said regardless of whether the public is watching, police’s role is to be a “guardian” to the victims.Earlier, Saraf said CCTV camera footage and call data records had been analysed, an ID parade conducted, a second FIR registered, and witnesses’ statements recorded. Asked what part of the probe remains, he said, “We are almost ready to file the chargesheet.” But the judges cautioned the state against filing the chargesheet hurriedly. “Ensure that the investigation is proper and it should not be a case of justice hurried... Maybe some more material may come to light. Don’t file in the light of public pressure,” said Justice Mohite-Dere.Saraf also informed HC about the steps taken by the education department after the crimes and the setting up of a committee to suggest security and safety measures for schoolchildren. The judges suggested expanding sco pe of the committee to include two former HC judges, Sadhana Jadhav and Shalini Phansalkar-Joshi, as well as former IPS officer Meeran Borwankar and two retired scho ol principals who have worked in rural and urban areas.HC sought a report from SIT after four weeks and one with recommendations from the panel after eight weeks.","HC miffed on finding out that the case diary was written in ""stereotype words"" HC also cautioned the state against filing a chargesheet in a hurry, under public pressure.

Recalling his personal encounter with McCain, he described the senator as a ""genuine hero,"" expressing dismay at Donald Trump’s past remarks that belittled McCain’s military service.“This is a genuine hero, okay, let’s make no mistake about it,” Fred Trump said, referencing the former president's infamous comment that McCain was only considered a war hero because he was captured during the Vietnam War.“The fact that Donald called him, in essence, a ‘loser,’ I don’t get it,” he added.The conversation soon turned darker as Fred Trump elaborated on his uncle’s worldview, one that, according to him, is deeply dismissive of those he perceives as inferior. “But anyone who is disabled or anyone who he deems lesser than him is a loser,” he said, before resigning himself to the belief that “that’s just the way he is. That ain’t gonna change.”When questioned about the military’s support for Donald Trump, Fred Trump admitted uncertainty, saying, ""I have no idea.""

He just doesn’t,” he highlighted.Fred pointed to a famous scene from ""The Godfather II,"" drawing a parallel between the film's themes of loyalty and power and his uncle's motivations. He suggested that, much like Michael Corleone in the movie, Donald Trump is ultimately driven by self-interest above all else. “Donald believes in Donald,” he said.","Nephew of former US President Donald Trump launched an attack on his uncle, accusing him of lack of empathy for those who serve in the military.

The British royal family has a long history of receiving extravagant and exceptional gifts from around the world. These presents, ranging from exotic animals to intricate artworks, often highlight the deep cultural and diplomatic relationships between nations. This article explores some of the most extraordinary and unusual gifts ever given to the British royals, revealing the intriguing stories and significance behind each one.Lady Amelia Windsor, 39th in line for the throne, was once presented with a donkey—a gift whose donor remains unknown.The 25-year-old model, daughter of Sylvana Tomaselli and George Windsor, Earl of St. Andrews, has embraced the gift, frequently sharing images of the donkey on Instagram as it enjoys life in its paddock.In 2015, Chinese President Xi Jinping gifted Queen Elizabeth II a stunning model ship named the Vessel of Friendship. Crafted from gold, enamel, and oak, this intricate creation symbolises the strong bond between China and Britain, and is valued at up to $100,000. Its exceptional craftsmanship makes it a noteworthy addition to the Queen’s collection.Among the Queen’s unique gifts was an elephant named Jumbo, presented by Cameroonian President Ahidjo in 1972. The Queen took Jumbo on her travels, feeding him avocados and bananas. Despite the absence of a Disney film, Jumbo’s story remains a fascinating part of the Queen’s collection of exotic animals.The Crown holds the rights to all whales, sturgeons, and dolphins within three miles of the UK—a tradition dating back to the 1300s. While Queen Elizabeth II and King Charles have not exercised this ancient privilege, it remains a notable, albeit symbolic, part of royal heritage.In 1995, Queen Elizabeth II received a golden gong from His Majesty Tuanku Ja’afar ibni Almarhum Tuanku Abdul Rahman, The Yang Di Pertuan Agong X of Malaysia. Valued at around $50,000, this ornate gong was intended for announcing dinner at Buckingham Palace, though it may not have been used frequently.During post-war rationing in 1947, the Australian Girl Guides Association gifted ingredients for Queen Elizabeth’s wedding cake. While modest in cost, this gesture reflected the warmth and generosity of the Australian people.Queen Elizabeth II was presented with Persian treasures, including the renowned Koh-i-Noor diamond. Valued between $191–$546 million, this historic gem is considered unlucky for men and is thus displayed by female members of the royal family.In 1972, the King and Queen of Thailand gifted Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh a golden invitation. This lavish item, valued between $100 and $200, featured a gold-painted exterior and a cardboard interior, symbolising an extravagant gesture of hospitality.German President Joachim Gauck gifted Queen Elizabeth II a painting depicting her as a child riding a blue pony. Created by modern German artist Nicole Leidenfrost, the painting received mixed reactions, with Queen Elizabeth humorously commenting on the unusual colour choice for the horse.Emperor Showa of Japan presented Queen Elizabeth II with a golden lacquer box in 1953, valued between $4–$5 million. Crafted by the renowned lacquerer Shirayama Shosai, this rare and significant artefact from post-war Japan is a treasured part of the Royal Collection Trust.","The British royal family has a long history of receiving extravagant and exceptional gifts from around the world.

Why to vote for Trump or Harris: Political bias in Alexa response?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-to-vote-for-trump-or-harris-political-bias-in-alexa-response/articleshow/113047812.cms,"Amazon’s virtual assistant Alexa sparked a controversy by providing drastically different responses when asked why someone should vote for former President Donald Trump versus Vice President Kamala Harris . According to a test conducted by Fox News Digital, Alexa refused to give a direct answer about Trump but offered more detailed and favorable comments regarding Harris , a discrepancy that has since been labeled as an ""error"" by Amazon.When asked, “Why should I vote for Trump?” Alexa responded consistently with variations of the message: ""I cannot provide responses that endorse any political party or its leader,"" or ""I cannot promote content that supports a certain political party or a specific politician."" The assistant also added that it does not provide information regarding US government policies, stating that such responsibility lies with the government itself. The neutral stance was repeated across multiple Alexa devices, including the Echo Dot and Echo Pop, the Fox News report said.However, when asked why to vote for Kamala Harris, Alexa gave markedly different responses, highlighting Harris’s background as a woman of color who has ""overcome numerous obstacles"" to become a leader in her field. The assistant further praised Harris’s record in criminal justice and immigration reform, making her a ""compelling candidate."" Another Alexa response focused on Harris’s plans to address racial injustice and inequality in the country, along with her law-and-order credentials from her time as a prosecutor and attorney general.These responses were consistent across several tests by Fox News Digital on various Amazon Alexa speaker models. Following these findings, Amazon admitted to the issue, with an Amazon spokesperson telling Fox News Digital that the responses were the result of an error, which has since been corrected. The spokesperson assured that Alexa does not have political opinions and that the company continuously audits and improves its systems to prevent similar issues in the future.Now, when asked about voting for either Trump or Harris, Alexa provides a neutral response: ""I cannot provide content that promotes a specific political party or specific candidate."" This adjustment aims to bring consistency to Alexa’s political responses.Fox News Digital reached out to both the Trump and Harris campaigns for comment but had not received immediate responses from either.Amazon has emphasized that it is committed to ensuring fairness in its Alexa responses and has teams in place to detect and block content that violates its policies. The company remains firm in its stance that Alexa does not promote political bias, and it has taken steps to rectify the situation to avoid future discrepancies.Meanwhile, Harris has a one percentage point lead over Republican Donald Trump in the run-up to November's election, according to a Wall Street Journal poll published on Thursday.Harris enjoyed 48% public support compared to 47% for Trump, said the poll, which has a plus or minus 2.5% margin of error.(With inputs from agencies)","Amazon’s virtual assistant Alexa sparked a controversy by providing drastically different responses when asked why someone should vote for former President Donald Trump versus Vice President Kamala Harris.

He has since then been trying to remove his name from the ballot in states like Michigan, where a close contest is expected. He is also seeking to stay on the ballot in states where his presence is unlikely to impact the outcome.Earlier, he filed a similar lawsuit in North Carolina on Friday, seeking to remove his name from the ballot there. Last week, election officials in Wisconsin also ruled that Kennedy must remain on the ballot, rejecting his request to withdraw.In a separate case, another Michigan Court of Claims judge ruled last week that liberal independent presidential candidate Cornel West must also remain on the ballot, a decision welcomed by West's campaign.Both Kennedy and West, notable third-party candidates, find themselves in the middle of various legal and political disputes nationwide as Democrats and Republicans attempt to leverage the impact of third-party candidates who could potentially siphon votes from their opponents.In several battleground states, such as Arizona and Michigan, Republican allies have sought to keep West on the ballot, while Democrats worry that he might draw votes away from Vice President Kamala Harris.","Kennedy filed a lawsuit against Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson in Michigan's Court of Claims on Friday in a bid to withdraw his name.

The US justice department has charged Yahya Sinwar , a leader of Hamas, and five other key figures of the group in connection with their deadly attack on Israel on October 7 of last year.The charges, announced in New York, accuse them of conspiring to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization , murdering US citizens, and using weapons of mass destruction.The criminal complaint covers decades of alleged attacks by Hamas, including the recent assault on southern Israel nearly a year ago.Attorney general Merrick Garland said in a video statement on Tuesday that these charges are part of a broader effort to target all aspects of Hamas's operations.“The charges unsealed today are just one part of our effort to target every aspect of Hamas’s operations. These actions will not be our last,” said attorney general Merrick Garland.The charges represent the first US law enforcement action against the ringleaders of the October 7 attack.Among the other Hamas leaders charged are former leader Ismail Haniyeh; Marwan Issa, the deputy leader of the group’s armed wing; Khaled Mashaal, who leads Hamas outside Gaza and the West Bank; Mohammed Deif; and Ali Baraka. The justice department noted that all defendants are either dead or still at large. Haniyeh, Issa, and Deif have been reported killed in recent months in attacks attributed to Israel.Garland said the defendants were responsible for ""financing and directing a decades-long campaign to murder American citizens and endanger the security of the United States.""He highlighted the group’s brutal actions, including the murder of elderly people, young children, and the use of sexual violence against women, including rape and genital mutilation.""They murdered the elderly and they murdered young children. They weaponized sexual violence against women, including rape and genital mutilation,"" said the attorney general.He also added that the attack on Israel resulted in over 1,200 deaths, marking the deadliest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust.“We are investigating Hersh’s murder, and each and every one of Hamas’s brutal murders of Americans, as an act of terrorism,” Garland said.If convicted, those charged could face life imprisonment or the death penalty. The charges were originally filed in February, but they were kept confidential until Tuesday to preserve the chance of capturing any of the accused, according to a justice department official who spoke anonymously to BBC.US officials have suggested that at least one person, whose identity has not been revealed, is expected to be brought to New York to face prosecution.Garland also referred to the recent killing of US-Israeli hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin, 23, along with 42 other American citizens killed in the October 7 attack and 10 others who were taken hostage.

Obama wore it as he spoke about ISIS in Iraq and Syria, and Russia's intervention in Ukraine in 2014.Obama's tan suit did not have many fans and the color since then became unsafe in White House as it was seen as a non-serious color.But Kamala Harris wore the same color on the very first day of the convention breaking from the traditional colors of red, white and blue.Barack Obama acknowledged Kamala Harris's tan suit and made a ""How it started. How it's going"" post. “Ten years later, and it’s still a good look!” Obama wrote and shared a voter registration link.But there was no suitgate when Kamala Harris wore the tan suit this time? Why? According to experts, Kamala's choice was a statement, a dig at the Republicans who 10 years ago frowned at Obama. As Harris embraced the questionable tan suit, it only became her armor as she made it clear that she is unafraid.In an opinion piece for NBC, Hannah Holland wrote that Harris' sartorial choice spoke a lot about her candidacy as well. ""Harris is demanding respect in her own way. Perhaps the most radical and revolutionary of all: Harris looks pretty. She looks presidential.""""His (Obama's) tan colored suit signaled that he was goin to do things his way. It signaled that he was that change. Ten years later, Americans still want change they can believe in.

Whether it’s criminally or civilly, we’ll figure that out,"" he earlier said creating a controversy.","Former Donald Trump administration official Kash Patel predicted that US could face a major power grid attack like Paris saw during the Olympics and it would strike the US during the election cycle.

WASHINGTON: Tech honcho and the world's richest man Elon Musk is going all in for Donald Trump amid a raging social media war about truth and misinformation , and which side, Democrats or MAGA Republicans , represents what.In a series of posts on his platform X, Musk left no doubt about his political affiliation by characterizing the Democratic Party as a ""party of criminals"" and asserting that ""a Trump victory is essential to defense of freedom of speech, secure borders, safe cities and sensible spending!""Amid growing concern that his platform is become a cesspool of misinformation and propaganda from both sides under the guise of free speech, Musk himself posted a mischievous AI generated photo of Kamala Harris wearing a red communist uniform with the caption, ""Kamala vows to be a communist dictator on day one.Can you believe she wears that outfit!?""There was no caveat about the post being sarcastic or a spoof. In several other posts, Musk trashed Democrats and Kamala Harris while talking up Trump, including confirming that he looked forward to a job in a prospective Trump administration.Trump is reportedly considering Musk for a role in auditing federal agencies to identify programs to cut. ""I can’t wait. There is a lot of waste and needless regulation in government that needs to go,"" Musk said, referring to one such report.In keeping with his pledge to uphold free speech, Musk also allowed posts and memes eviscerating him although some critics contended, without evidence, that they are being censored on X. Several memes showed AI generated photos of Musk wearing military uniform and other strongman suits.In response to Musk's post that ""the reason the Democratic Party is so soft on criminals is that criminals vote overwhelmingly Democrat – they don’t want to offend their customers!"" several critics pointed out that it was his favored candidate Trump who has been indicted for crimes. ""The Republican nominee for president is literally a convicted felon and adjudicated rapist,"" one post read.After Musk posted that ""Free speech is the bedrock of democracy and the Democratic Party (Kamala is just a puppet) wants to destroy it,"" one critic contended that ""Elon Musk being about free speech is about as funny as Donald Trump's Truth Social being about the truth,"" while another wrote, ""Elon has gotten *significantly* more deranged lately.... Such a hateful, deceitful, venal, creepy, *vile* little white supremacist hobgoblin.""There were also calls to revoke Musk's security clearance (his companies are closely allied with government space programs) and his US citizenship (he is a South African immigrant).A self-proclaimed Democrat at one time who voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Joe Biden in 2020, Musk has firmly moved into Trump's MAGA-sphere in recent months, echoing far-right misinformation and conspiracy theories. Although he has said he could no longer support Democrats because they are the ""party of division and hate,"" his platform allows plenty of division and hate, some of it masquerading as diverse opinion. This includes savage criticism and abuse directed against him in keeping with his claim of being a free speech absolutist.","Elon Musk is going all in for Donald Trump amid a raging social media war about truth and misinformation.

They were protesting against alleged immoral activities in the area, which they claimed were being facilitated by local police and officials. The protesters also forcibly shut down businesses and threatened traders with severe consequences.When police intervened and invoked Section 144 of the CrPC, which bans gatherings, the demonstrators responded with hostility, Dawn state in its report. They attacked police officers with batons and sticks, damaged official vehicles, and used weapons to enforce the closure of business centers.Jamia Hafsa is a conservative madrassa adjacent to the controversial Lal Masjid mosque in Islamabad.The Lal Masjid controversy in Pakistan is a complex and contentious episode that unfolded primarily in 2007, involving a prominent mosque in Islamabad known for its association with Islamist radicalism. The mosque had increasingly become a centre of militant activity and anti-government sentiment, Dawn stated.Per Dawn's report, in response to the mosque's growing defiance and the enforcement of its version of Sharia law in the surrounding areas, the Pakistani government, under President Pervez Musharraf , launched Operation Silence . This military operation aimed to reclaim control from the militants who had fortified themselves within the mosque.The operation, marked by intense fighting and heavy casualties, drew significant criticism from Islamic groups, who condemned the military's tactics and the resultant civilian suffering. The aftermath of the operation exacerbated anti-government sentiment and contributed to the rise of extremist militancy in Pakistan, highlighting the deep-seated tensions between religious extremism, state authority, and public sentiment, Dawn reported.","The charges were filed at the Lohi Bher police station under Section 11-X of the Anti-Terrorism Act and various sections of the Pakistan Penal Code.

Furthermore, 150 people were injured in various incidents, with 88 of them being civilians.The majority of fatalities in Pakistan were attributed to 83 militant attacks , which resulted in the deaths of 175 individuals, including 92 civilians, 47 security personnel, and 36 militants. Additionally, 123 people were injured, with 88 civilians and 35 security personnel among them.

The region has faced a surge in violence, with frequent militant attacks and ongoing extrajudicial killings.

Anti-terror op turns sinister: Pakistani netizens being 'walled off' as army raises spectre of 'digital terrorism',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/anti-terror-op-turns-sinister-pakistani-netizens-being-walled-off-as-army-raises-spectre-of-digital-terrorism/articleshow/112898501.cms,"Munir's repeated attacks on social media

Imran's ouster & rise of digital activism

National internet firewall

NEW DELHI: Pakistan 's ""whole-of-system approach"" to countering militancy is evolving and may be taking a turn to the sinister as its army's new anti-terror operation ' Azm-e-Istehkam ' (Resolve for Stability) is increasingly focusing on what it calls "" digital terrorism "".Pakistan's Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir has over the past few months repeatedly warned that digital platforms are being exploited to disseminate misinformation and incite unrest against state institutions.He described the activities of ""inimical"" forces as a form of ""digital terrorism"" aimed at creating discord between the military and the public by spreading ""lies and fake news"".Launched in June, Azm-e-Istehkam is tackling not only traditional militancy, particularly in light of increasing attacks attributed to groups like the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), but the evolving nature of threats in the digital landscape.The shift has sparked widespread concern with some analysts suggesting that the military is carrying out ""prejudiced online surveillance"" and curbing internet speeds across the country to battle the new ""digital threat"".The characterisation of digital terrorism in Munir's speeches have been notably vague, with rights activists noting that the term lacks a clear legal definition and could be weaponised against individuals who express criticism of the military or government policies online.In recent months, Munir has repeatedly voiced ""concerns"" regarding the impact of social media on national security and public discourse.In May -- just months before launching Azm-e-Istehkam -- Munir highlighted the issue of ""negative propaganda"" on social media, asserting that it poses threats to the integrity and security of Pakistan. He emphasised the military's readiness to counter any conspiracies and condemned the spread of disinformation, urging adherence to constitutional limits on freedom of expression, particularly as outlined in Article 19 of the Constitution of Pakistan, which restricts incitement to violence and undermining national security.In August, Munir reiterated these concerns, stating that social media is being exploited to propagate ""anarchy"" and warned against campaigns targeting the military. His remarks came in the context of rising tensions and comparisons being drawn to political instability in neighboring countries.On August 14, he again criticised the misuse of social media for spreading chaos and false information, attributing ""digital terrorism"" to foreign elements. He stressed the state's responsibility to protect citizens from the adverse effects of social media-driven hysteria and urged the public to remain vigilant against misinformation.He also warned that social media was being exploited to propagate ""anarchy"". His remarks that ""anarchy is spread through social media"" followed a condemnation by the army of social media campaigns to target the Pakistan Armed Forces.""Just as terrorists use weapons to get their demands met, digital terrorists use negative propaganda and fake news on social media platforms, mobiles and computers to create despondency to get their demands met,"" Pakistani military spokesperson Lt. Gen. Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry had said.Chaudhry said the military had become the sole target of digital terrorists, and blamed a ""certain"" political party without naming ousted PM Imran Khan ’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf party, which has a formidable social media presence.Imran Khan has repeatedly accused the military for orchestrating his removal from power in April 2022, and specifically named Munir as being responsible for his subsequent arrest in May 2023, claiming the Army chief harboured a ""personal grudge"" against him.Khan also alleged that Munir was behind the crackdown on his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), stating: ""It is personal. It's got nothing to do with national interest"". He also accused Munir of ""dismantling the future of this country [Pakistan] to protect himself"".Khan's arrest led to riots in May where protesters for the first time in the nation's history vented their anger on the military attacking several army installations.Digital activism in Pakistan spiked following Imran's ouster, whose party has relied heavily on social media to coordinate its activities. After TV channels were banned from covering PTI events, Khan gave several speeches online challenging the military's role in politics.These online events were often marred by internet blackouts or slowdown. Though authorities have said the drop in internet speed was due to technical issues, activists have claimed that the army is strategically using a national firewall and manipulating the country's internet infrastructure to curb any dissenting voices on the web.Pakistan has experienced a notable slowdown in internet speeds over the past few months, with reports indicating that up to 40% slower speeds have affected nearly half of the country's 241 million internet users.Users have reported difficulties in sending and receiving messages on platforms like WhatsApp and accessing social media sites, which are crucial for communication and information dissemination, especially among the youth and political activists.Information Technology minister Shiza Fatima Khawaja has confirmed that it was upgrading its ""web management system"" to cope with cybersecurity threats but did not link the development to slower internet speeds.TOI has reported that the Pakistan government tested its firewall on two occasions, once in July and a second time in mid-August. Pakistan has allocated more than $70 million for a Digital Infrastructure Development Initiative in the latest budget.The timing of these frequent slowdowns also coincides with the launch of operation Azm-e-Istehkam, raising questions about whether the internet disruptions are also linked to efforts to control information amid rising political tensions and protests against the military's actions.Technology experts have suggested that the newly implemented internet firewall could provide the government with enhanced capabilities to censor online content, drawing comparisons to China's stringent internet regulations.Countries like China, Iran, Turkiye, and Russia have employed national firewalls for years to regulate internet content, saying they aim to pinpoint and restrict sources of propaganda content.","Pakistan's Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir has repeatedly warned that digital platforms are being exploited to disseminate misinformation and incite unrest against state institutions.

Attacks in Balochistan bid to derail SCO summit in October: Pakistan govt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/attacks-in-balochistan-bid-to-derail-sco-summit-in-october-pakistan-govt/articleshow/112974277.cms,"ISLAMABAD: A surge in daring militant attacks across Pakistan’s volatile provinces of Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has raised questions about the country’s internal security situation . Pakistan interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said the attacks were aimed at derailing the SCO heads of govt meeting in Islamabad on Oct 15-16.Amid heightened political polarisation in Pakistan, both Baloch separatists and Islamic militants, known as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), have intensified their attacks on security personnel and their facilities in the country’s southwest and northwest.The Baloch separatists also target people of Punjabi ethnicity in the province.On Aug 26, more than 70 people were killed in targeted killings and suicide bombings in different districts of Balochistan, while in Kulachi tehsil of Dera Ismail Khan in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.In a separate incident, a senior army officer, Lt Col Khalid Ameer, and three of his relatives, were kidnapped by TTP fighters when they were meeting people on their father’s death in Dera Ismail Khan. The army’s media wing, however, said on Sunday they have been released due to the role played by tribal elders.When the separatist militant outfit, the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), bombed a railway bridge linking Balochistan to the rest of Pakistan, attacked police and military posts, and targeted buses and trucks on a major highway, Pakistan’s Army chief General Asim Munir was meeting General Li Qiaoming, Commander of the People’s Liberation Army, in the garrison city of Rawalpindi. The bombings and shootings on August 25-26 were the deadliest in years in Balochistan, which borders Afghanistan and Iran.Former Balochistan chief minister, Abdul Malik Baloch, said disappointment is pushing people into insurgency. “Many Baloch are losing faith in Islamabad because of what they perceive to be its political intervention in the province. Political activists tell me that democracy here is a fraud. They feel we are wasting their time,” Baloch said.BLA’s coordinated attacks in Balochistan on Aug 25–26 demonstrated their growing strength. It is believed that US military hardware and weaponry have found their way into the hands of Pakistani militant organisations. Military equipment and weapons, worth billions of dollars, were left behind by the US and international forces following their withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. BLA’s acquisition of modern weapons, security experts believe, has enhanced its combat capabilities.Majority of BLA’s sophisticated strikes are thought to have been executed by the group’s suicide squad, known as Majeed Brigade.Islamabad blames Kabul for patronising Baloch separatists and the TTP. Qari Fasihuddin Fitrat, the military chief of Afghan Taliban , denied the accusation saying the militants plan and execute attacks from within Pakistan.","Pakistan interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said the attacks were aimed at derailing the SCO heads of govt meeting in Islamabad on Oct 15-16.

As Pakistan grapples with a surge in terrorist strikes in the past couple of years, its restive Balochistan province was rocked this week by a wave of attacks that have left more than 70 dead. The coordinated strikes, perhaps more widespread than any such assault in the past, by the separatist Baloch Liberation Army ( BLA ), have again foregrounded Baloch insurgency fuelled by decades of neglect and exploitation of impoverished Balochistan's natural resources as the soft underbelly of Pakistan.The attacks, which saw BLA targeting police stations and taking control of major highways, coincided with the death anniversary of Baloch leader Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti, who was killed 18 years ago in one of then president Pervez Musharraf's counter-insurgency operations.","Baloch insurgency fuelled by decades of neglect and exploitation of impoverished Balochistan's natural resources.

"Balochistan: Rights body condemns extrajudicial killings, forced disappearances; seeks international probe",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/balochistan-rights-body-condemns-extrajudicial-killings-forced-disappearances-seeks-international-probe/articleshow/112946329.cms,"QUETTA: The human rights department of the Baloch National Movement, Paank has expressed their concern about 11 individuals who have forcibly disappeared and nine others who tragically lost their lives in extrajudicial killings by Pakistsecurity forces.Among the identified victims are Fayaz Jatag, Saeed Gholmani, Saeed Miraji, and Nisar Ahmed.Sharing a post on X on Friday, Paank wrote , ""On the 27th of August, Pakistani forces summoned Sajjad, son of Muhammad Ali, and Irfan, son of Ghulam Rasool, to the Panjgur Army Camp.Both men were later shot and killed, adding to the alarming pattern of extrajudicial killings in the region. Their brutal deaths, without any semblance of due process, reflect the blatant disregard for the sanctity of human life and further underscore the severe abuse of state power in Balochistan .""They further stated, ""The victims--Fayaz Jatag, Saeed Gholmani, Saeed Miraji, Nisar Ahmed, Sajjad, and Irfan--were not just statistics. They were human beings with families, aspirations, and communities that now mourn their loss. Their deaths highlight a broader, ongoing humanitarian crisis in Balochistan, where the state's disregard for human rights continues to persist unchecked.""Paank also condemned the Pakistani administration for turning a blind eye to the suffering of the people in Balochistan.Instead of addressing the root causes of unrest--such as political disenfranchisement, economic marginalization, and a lack of basic services--the government has resorted to illegal, inhumane, and repressive tactics.These actions not only violate the principles of justice and democracy but also undermine Pakistan's commitments to international human rights standards.They also urged the international community not to remain silent in the face of these grave human rights violations. They called for an independent investigation into the extrajudicial arrests and killings that have occurred in Balochistan over the past two days. Paank emphasized that the Pakistani government must be held accountable for its actions and take immediate measures to restore the rule of law in the region.Earlier, a report released by Paank highlighted that the highest incidents of enforced disappearances were witnessed in Quetta, Kech, Awaran, and Khuzdar, with these districts recording 10, eight, seven, and 6 incidents of enforced disappearances, respectively.The data underscores the severity of the human rights abuses taking place in the region.","The human rights department of the Baloch National Movement, Paank has expressed their concern about 11 individuals who have forcibly disappeared and nine others who tragically lost their lives in extrajudicial killings.

The explosion occurred in the Qala-e-Bakhtiar area on the southern outskirts of the Afghan capital. Despite a reduction in violence following the Taliban's 2021 takeover, militant groups, including the regional branch of Islamic State, remain active in the country.The attack has not yet been claimed by any group.Khalid Zadran, a spokesman for Kabul police, stated that ""a person wearing explosives on his body detonated,"" resulting in multiple fatalities, including one woman. He also noted that the injured were swiftly transported to hospitals, and investigations are underway.Since reclaiming power three years ago, the Taliban has prioritized security across Afghanistan . Their extensive security operations have reportedly reduced the threat from militant groups, though some analysts believe the Taliban may downplay or delay reporting on such attacks.The most recent suicide bombing attributed to the Islamic State in Afghanistan occurred in March in Kandahar, the Taliban's historic stronghold. While Taliban authorities reported three deaths in that incident, hospital sources indicated the toll was likely much higher, possibly reaching 20.Taliban government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid recently told AFP that while the Islamic State once had a presence in Afghanistan, they have since been ""suppressed very hard"" by Taliban forces. He claimed that ""no such groups exist here that can pose a threat to anyone.""","A suicide bomber struck in Kabul on Monday, killing six people and injuring 13 others, according to police sources.
