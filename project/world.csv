'Hurt religious sentiments': Image of Jesus Christ replaced by Lord Krishna in Durga puja pandal; move comes after VHP protest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hurt-religious-sentiments-image-of-jesus-christ-replaced-by-lord-krishna-in-durga-puja-pandal-move-comes-after-vhp-protest/articleshow/124176145.cms,"Poll Do you think the replacement of Jesus Christ's image with Lord Krishna's at the Durga Puja pandal was justified? Yes No

NEW DELHI: An image of Jesus Christ inside a 'Vatican City-themed' Durga Puja pandal in Ranchi was replaced on Friday with that of Lord Krishna.The development came following objections raised by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP). The VHP alleged that the marquee, organised by R R Sporting Club at Ratu Road, was made to ""hurt the religious sentiments of Hindus"" and encourage conversion. The organisers had rejected these charges earlier on Thursday.The club’s patron Vicky Yadav said the decision was taken by the puja committee members and not due to protests by any section, reports news agency PTI. “It was not due to the protest by a certain section but by our committee members to show all religions on the same platform,” he said. He said that European-style statues placed outside the pandal were retained.Yadav claimed that the design aimed to promote peace and brotherhood. ""India stands for religious harmony. If that doesn’t exist, then why not just declare this a Hindu nation?"" he asked, showing videos of Prime Minister Narendra Modi visiting churches abroad during official trips.He said the idea was inspired by India’s multi-faith culture and that the club promotes Sanatan Dharma..""We have been organising Durga Puja for the last 50 years, and every year we make pandals based on certain themes. This year, we decided to replicate the Durga Puja pandal made by Sreebhumi Sporting Club in Kolkata in 2022 on the theme of Vatican City,"" Yadav said.VHP national spokesperson Vinod Bansal had expressed concern on Thursday on X, saying, ""This has been done with an objective to hurt the religious sentiments of Hindus and aimed at encouraging religious conversion. If the organising committee of this Durga Puja pandal is so interested in secularism, I would ask them to display a photograph of a Hindu God or Goddess at any event organised by the Church or at Madrasas in Ranchi.

Leh Protests: DGP Explains Wangchuk Arrest, Pakistan Connection Under Scanner

Police cite foreign links, wife counters

'Peaceful protest escalated due to CRPF action '

Defence against financial charges

Call for 'mindful development'

NEW DELHI: Jailed climate activist Sonam Wangchuk ’s wife, Gitanjali Angmo, dismissed allegations of Pakistan links and financial irregularities against him, insisting that he has always advocated in the “most Gandhian way possible. ”Wangchuk, a prominent face of the five-year-long agitation for Ladakh’s statehood and inclusion under the Sixth Schedule, was detained under the National Security Act (NSA) on Friday. His arrest came two days after violent protests in Leh on September 24 left four dead and 90 injured. He has since been lodged in Jodhpur prison in Rajasthan.Speaking to news agency PTI over the phone, Angmo, co-founder of the Himalayan Institute of Alternative Learning (HIAL), said she has not been able to contact her husband since his detention. “They promised to send [the detention order] on Friday. We will take legal recourse,” she said.Ladakh DGP SD Singh Jamwal said Wangchuk is being investigated for alleged links with Pakistan following the arrest of a Pakistani Intelligence Operative last month, who reportedly circulated videos of his protests. The police also flagged Wangchuk’s “suspicious” overseas trips, including a visit to Pakistan to attend an event organised by The Dawn.Angmo, however, said their recent visit across the border was purely professional and focused on climate issues. “We attended a conference organised by the United Nations, and it was on climate change. The glacier on the top of the Himalayas is not going to see whether I'm flowing into Pakistan or India,” she said.She added that the ‘Breathe Pakistan’ conference in February was hosted by the UN Pakistan and Dawn Media, with international participation. “There are organisations like the ICIMOD, which bring together all the eight Hindu Kush countries and work on different issues. We are part of the ICIMOD’s Himalayan University Consortium,” she explained.Angmo also pointed out that Wangchuk had praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the event. “The Nepal and Bangladesh reference being bandied around is actually an example Sonam gave, i.e., ‘when governments are not responsive, it leads to a revolution’. We should avoid the interpretations,” she said.Angmo strongly contested the NSA charges, arguing that Wangchuk has a long track record of peaceful protests. “I think it is a very wrong charge. Sonam certainly is not a threat to any public order,” she said.She insisted that the Leh Apex Body protest was peaceful until security forces intervened. “We have videos to show that the students and the youth were just there for a peaceful protest. Sonam did not even know about (a non-peaceful plan)… But when the CRPF personnel fired tear gas shells, the youth reacted by pelting stones, and the whole situation escalated.”Questioning the force’s response, she asked: “My question is, who gave the CRPF the right to open fire? Why should you open fire on your own people, on your own youth?”On allegations that Wangchuk delivered a provocative speech, she said his words were mistranslated. “He just said that ‘when change has to happen, it can start with one individual, or with the death of one individual and that individual could be me; I'm happy to give my life for it’,” Angmo explained.Angmo also rejected allegations of financial irregularities involving Wangchuk’s institutions, presenting details on HIAL’s funding, UGC registration, and land allotment.She said HIAL did not receive foreign donations without FCRA clearance, clarifying that payments were made for services. “We have the service agreements, which say this is a consulting assignment that we're giving to HIAL for which we will be paying them,” she said.According to her, HIAL, where 400 students study free of cost, covers expenses through innovations such as ice stupas and passive solar buildings, and does not patent its technologies. She added that the institute applied for UGC registration in 2022 and deposited ₹15 lakh, but the process has been stalled.Angmo said the lease for HIAL’s land remains unresolved due to the UT administration’s lack of a category for such institutions. “While questions are being raised on HIAL, the Sindhu Central University, which started in 2021, still doesn't have a building,” she noted.Angmo stressed that her husband is not against development, but supports giving Ladakhis a say in shaping it under the Sixth Schedule. She highlighted HIAL’s proposal to use translucent solar panels in Changtang to both generate electricity and grow fodder for Pashmina goats.“This kind of mindful development is what he’s talking about... HIAL is at the forefront of innovation. It is not that he’s anti-development,” she said.Meanwhile, the Union home ministry has cancelled the FCRA licence of the Students' Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh (SECMOL), an organisation founded by Wangchuk, citing alleged financial discrepancies.",Sonam Wangchuk was detained under the National Security Act (NSA) on Friday.

In 2018, he directed members to discontinue the use of the shorthand terms “Mormon” and “LDS.” He lifted restrictions on baptisms for children of same-sex couples while maintaining prohibitions on same-sex marriage and limiting participation for members undergoing gender-affirming procedures.Nelson led the Church through the COVID-19 pandemic, ended its affiliation with the Boy Scouts of America, and oversaw an increase in temple construction worldwide.

Candace Owens has now come up with a new conspiracy theory claiming that she now has sources confirming that Tyler Robinson was framed and he was not the person who shot and killed Charlie Kirk. Candace said everything the Feds said about the case so far and about how Tyler Robinson was caught is a lie, including that Tyler Robinson is suicidal.“I want to break this news immediately because it feels important and I think if I don’t break it immediately, something bad might happen,"" Candace said teasing a big reveal on Monday giving a weekend cliffhanger for her viewers.“Tyler Robinson is not suicidal.

Thomas Jacob Sanford, 40, of Burton, has been identified as the suspect in a shooting at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc Township, Michigan, where police reported at least two people were killed and eight others injured.Authorities said Sanford drove his pickup truck into the church before exiting and opening fire with an assault rifle.Sanford was killed by the police in the church parking lot, said Grand Blanc Township police chief William Renye, as cited by Click on Detroit.Sanford, a US Marine veteran, reportedly drove his Chevy Silverado into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc Township, Michigan, before opening fire with a semi-automatic rifle.An old Facebook post by Sanford’s mother indicates that the gunman served in Iraq from 2004 to 2008.Authorities also noted that Sanford’s truck bore a license plate reading ""IRAQ"" and featured window decals that have not yet been identified.In 2021, he took out a mortgage loan through the Veterans Administration (VA) on his Michigan property, confirming his military service, though the branch remains unclear.Public records indicate that Sanford was a veteran, with his only known legal issue stemming from a rent dispute in Utah, as reported by Newsweek.Social media accounts reportedly linked to Sanford indicate that he was a family man, with a wife and young son, as cited by the New York Post.A now-inactive GoFundMe page from 2015 raised over $3,000 for Sanford's son, who is now 10, after he was born with congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI), a rare genetic disorder in which the pancreas produces excessive insulin.The shooting comes hours after Russell M Nelson, the 17th president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the oldest leader in its history, passed away at his Salt Lake City home on Saturday at the age of 101.","Thomas Jacob Sanford, 40, has been identified as the suspect in a shooting at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc Township, Michigan.

Donald Trump openly wanted Ivanka Trump and Tom Brady together

Tom Brady chose Gisele Bündchen, and Ivanka Trump chose Jared Kushner

The resurfacing of old interviews and memoirs has reignited curiosity about one of the strangest “what if” stories in celebrity and political gossip: Donald Trump once wished his daughter Ivanka Trump would end up with NFL legend Tom Brady. While the rumor never turned into reality, the speculation still fascinates fans years later, especially considering Brady’s high-profile marriage to Gisele Bündchen.Ivanka Trump, now long married to Jared Kushner, was often positioned in her father’s orbit of power moves. According to Jared Kushner’s 2022 book Breaking History, Donald Trump once tried to rattle him by suggesting that Tom Brady was interested in Ivanka. The former president even told Playboy back in 2004: “I think Tom’s a great guy, and I think he and Ivanka would make a great combination.”The idea wasn’t just private musings. Donald Trump repeated this “dream pairing” during conversations with Howard Stern , calling Brady and Ivanka a potential “power dynasty.” But Tom Brady himself later shut down the speculation, telling Stern in 2020: “No, there was never that, where we ever dated or anything like that.”Despite Donald Trump’s matchmaking efforts, Brady never pursued Ivanka. Instead, he married Brazilian supermodel Gisele Bündchen in February 2009 — just months before Ivanka married Jared Kushner in October of the same year. Brady later reflected: “Look, it all worked out for me anyway. I married the woman of my dreams. I think I married the most amazing woman, so I have no regrets.”Though Brady and Bündchen divorced in 2022, they remain two of the most recognizable names in sports and fashion.Ivanka, meanwhile, has stepped back from politics to focus on family life with Kushner.Looking back, experts suggest that even if Ivanka and Brady had dated, their ambitions and lifestyles might have created the same challenges Brady faced with Gisele. As matchmaker Susan Trombetti explained, both Ivanka and Brady thrived in high-profile worlds but may have struggled with time apart and competing commitments.Also Read: Tom Brady’s MAGA hat nearly ripped the Patriots dynasty apart from the inside In the end, what could have been a Trump-Brady dynasty never materialized — leaving this story as one of celebrity culture’s more unusual political side notes.","Donald Trump openly wanted Ivanka Trump and Tom Brady together in 2004.

Israeli military transfers data as Microsoft cuts access





Microsoft has cut off cloud computing and AI services to an Israeli military intelligence unit after an investigation revealed the technology was being used for mass surveillance of Palestinian civilians. The tech giant made the decision following a Guardian investigation that exposed how Israel's Unit 8200 stored millions of intercepted Palestinian phone calls on Microsoft's Azure platform.Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and vice chair, announced the termination in an internal memo to employees, stating the company found ""evidence that supports elements of The Guardian's reporting."" The blocked services include cloud storage and AI technologies that Unit 8200 had used to collect and analyze up to ""a million calls an hour"" from Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.An Israeli security official downplayed the impact, telling CNN there is ""no damage to the operational capabilities of the IDF."" Neither the Israel Defense Forces nor the Ministry of Defense responded to requests for comment about the service termination.The No Azure for Apartheid group, which includes of Microsoft employees, had been pressured Microsoft for over a year through protests and demonstrations, called the decision a significant win.""Today's news is a significant and unprecedented win for the campaign and our organizing,"" said Hossam Nasr, an organizer with the group, noting Microsoft became ""the first US tech company to stop the sale of some technologies to the Israeli military since the start of the genocide in Gaza. ""However, the activist group said the action doesn't go far enough, as Microsoft only disabled services to a single unit while ""the vast majority of Microsoft's contract with the Israeli military remains intact."" The group vowed to continue organizing until all their demands are met.The company said it applies its anti-surveillance principles globally and has maintained this stance for over two decades, with Smith noting that customer privacy commitments prevented Microsoft from accessing the surveillance data directly during its investigation.Intelligence sources told the Guardian that Unit 8200 quickly moved the massive data trove out of Microsoft's Dutch servers within days of the original investigation's publication in August. The unit reportedly plans to transfer the surveillance data to Amazon Web Services, though Amazon has not responded to requests for comment.Smith emphasized that Microsoft ""does not provide technology to facilitate mass surveillance of civilians"" and noted the decision doesn't affect the company's broader relationship with Israel, including cybersecurity work. However, the termination raises questions about Israel's policy of storing sensitive military intelligence on foreign-owned cloud platforms.",Microsoft has cut off cloud computing and AI services to an Israeli military intelligence unit.

Big Win For Trump Amid Trade Faceoff With China, TikTok Algorithm Now Under American Oversight

Trump: “American operated all the way”



What’s Next







US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order approving the proposal sale of TikTok’s US operations to an American investor group. With this move, the Trump administration aims to resolve the long‑standing national security concerns while keeping the popular video app available to millions of U.S. users. As reported by Reuters, Vice President JD Vance revealed that the agreement values TikTok’s US business at $14 billion. The executive order signed by Trump temporarily bars the Department of Justice from enforcing a law that would have forced TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance face a nationwide ban.Under the deal, TikTok US will now form a new board of directors. Also, the recommendations algorithm, source code and content moderation systems of TikTok will be transferred to the new owners. As per the executive order signed by Trump, Oracle will now oversee TikTok’s US security operations and also offer cloud services.Also, investors including Oracle, Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based MGX are said to take around 45% stake in the new entity. ""There was some resistance on the Chinese side, but the fundamental thing that we wanted to accomplish is that we wanted to keep TikTok operating, but we also wanted to make sure that we protected Americans' data privacy as required by law,"" Vance told Reuters.As reported by Reuters, Trump has told the reporters that he had a word with Chinese President Xi Jinping, who gave his approval for the arrangement. “I told him what we were doing, and he said, ‘Go ahead with it,’” Trump said, adding that TikTok U.S. would be “American operated all the way.”The President also said that the new ownership structure will make sure that the social media platform is not being used as a ‘propaganda tool’.ByteDance has not yet publicly commented on the executive order but previously said it would comply with applicable laws to ensure TikTok remains available to American users.","US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order approving the proposal sale of TikTok’s US operations to an American investor group.

At least three people were killed and dozens injured on Sunday as clashes erupted between aboriginal tribesmen and the Bengali settler community in southeastern Bangladesh, following the alleged gang rape of a tribal girl.The unrest first began in Khagrachhari district headquarters, where tribal groups, mainly from the Chakma and Marma communities, enforced a roadblock with burning tyres, tree trunks, and bricks on Saturday.Authorities responded by restricting movement and rallies, but the violence later spread to the Guimara area, 36 kilometres south of the district headquarters.“Three people were killed in gunshots at Guimara.

The girl was reportedly found by her parents and neighbours around midnight in an unconscious state after returning from private tuition.She received treatment at a local hospital. Police later arrested a Bengali teenager suspected to be involved and placed him under six-day remand for questioning.The violence also injured 13 army personnel and three policemen, according to the home ministry in Dhaka.The home ministry issued a statement on Sunday evening expressing regret over the casualties, pledging legal action against those responsible, and urging residents to remain calm.“The ministry of home affairs has expressed deep sorrow over the incident in which three hill people were killed and 13 army personnel, including a major, three policemen, including the OC of Guimara Police Station and many others were injured in an attack by miscreants in Guimara Upazila of Khagrachhari district,” said the statement.","Clashes erupted between aboriginal tribesmen and the Bengali settler community in southeastern Bangladesh.

BHOPAL: Once a familiar face among European backpackers in Kathmandu, Darke Lama, 50, is today one of the most wanted wildlife traffickers in South Asia.Interpol has issued a red corner notice against him for his role in the 2015 Satpura Tiger Reserve poaching case in MP, placing his name on the wanted list of 195 countries. The notice follows the earlier arrest of his close associate Jaiy Tamang, once considered the kingpin of the network.Fluent in German and employed as a tourist guide in Nepal, Lama allegedly doubled as a crucial middleman in the illegal trade of endangered species. The hunt for Lama is no longer just MP's fight, it has become part of the world's battle against organised wildlife crime, officials said.Lama first attracted suspicion in 2003 when his name surfaced in connection with the illicit trade in shahtoosh wool, woven from the under-fur of the endangered Tibetan antelope and banned for its devastating impact on the species.Over the years, his operations allegedly expanded to include Keeda Jadi (Cordyceps), a highly valued caterpillar fungus used in Chinese medicine, along with tiger bones and red sanders, the rare Indian timber trafficked to East Asia.Investigators describe him as a trusted lieutenant of Tamang, accused of helping build supply routes from MP's tiger reserves and Himalayan grasslands to buyers in Nepal and China.Officials say his capture could provide unprecedented insight into the wider architecture of the trade.The Satpura case exposed one of India's most organised poaching syndicates. Skins, bones, and organs of tigers killed in MP were allegedly smuggled into Nepal and routed further to China.Since the probe began, 30 people have been arrested, and in Dec 2022, a Narmadapuram court convicted 27 of them, handing each a five-year sentence. Tamang was later tracked and arrested in Delhi's Majnu ka Tila area for trafficking tiger hides and pangolin scales, but Lama continues to evade capture.Lama's name has also emerged in other international seizures. In April 2015, Ethiopian authorities confiscated eight Indian tiger hides, at least three of which are suspected to have originated from Satpura.The matter was flagged during a National Tiger Conservation Authority technical committee meeting, and WCCB proposed sending a team to Ethiopia with Global Tiger Forum, though the plan stalled over financial approvals.In 2013, Nepal police seized five tiger skins and seven sacks of bones in Nuwakot district while they were being smuggled to Tibet. Analysis by WII, Dehradun, confirmed that one of the hides belonged to T-13, a tigress from Pench Tiger Reserve.","Darke Lama, 50, a former Kathmandu tourist guide, is now Interpol's most-wanted wildlife trafficker.

New York Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani on Sunday responded to Mayor Eric Adams’ shock decision to drop out of the race just over a month before Election Day, calling it a reflection of Adams’ ties to wealthy donors and national political figures rather than a shift in the city’s priorities.“It is very much the same race,” Mamdani told reporters. “It’s a race between us and the failed politics that we’ve seen, whether it’s Andrew Cuomo or Eric Adams… We’re going to show that they can’t dictate the outcome of this race”, he said, as per ABC 7 New York.Mamdani, who decisively defeated Cuomo in the Democratic primary, emphasised that his campaign remains focused on New Yorkers and the affordability crisis.“New Yorkers deserve leadership that is thinking about how to benefit the people of the city… too often politicians, be it Andrew Cuomo or Eric Adams, the meetings that they have or the phone calls with someone like Donald Trump , they’re only speaking about themselves”, he said, as quoted by democracynow.org.Criticising Adams’ record, Mamdani highlighted rising costs under the mayoralty. “This is a mayor who raised the rent by 12% on more than 2 million New Yorkers… and time and time again, exacerbated a cost-of-living crisis,” he claimed.Mamdani also addressed US President Donald Trump’s involvement and efforts to influence the race.“Donald Trump has spoken time and again about how he wants to narrow this race… yet we’re seeing the moment where he is shaping this race. But we’re going to show him that New Yorkers are tired of his politics and they’re tired of being priced out of the city”, he said, according to The Hill.He issued a pointed message to Cuomo, who has likely benefited from Adams’ exit. “To Andrew Cuomo. You got your wish. You wanted Trump and your billionaire friends to help you clear the field. But don’t forget, you wanted me as your opponent in the primary too, and we beat you by 13 points”.Despite Adams’ withdrawal, Mamdani insisted his campaign strategy remains unchanged. “We will have the same focus as we’ve always had, on working-class New Yorkers, their struggle to afford this city… and making sure the politics of the past do not dictate our future”.In polls, Mamdani currently leads the field with 45% support, ahead of Cuomo at 25%, Sliwa at 9%, and Adams at 8%.",New York Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani on Sunday responded to Mayor Eric Adams' shock decision to drop out of the race.

US Vice President JD Vance on Sunday said Russia must “wake up and accept reality” in its ongoing war against Ukraine, emphasising that the United States continues to push for peace.In an interview with Fox News, Vance said, “We want peace here”.“We have been actively pursuing peace from the very beginning of the administration, but the Russians have got to wake up and accept reality here”, he added.Vance attributed recent shifts in US policy and President Donald Trump’s confidence in Ukraine’s ability to reclaim territory to the mounting human and economic toll on Russia.“The Russian economy is in shambles. The Russians are not gaining much on the battlefield. It’s clearly time for them to listen to his passionate plea for them to come to the table and actually talk seriously about peace,” he said.Trump has called Russia a “paper tiger” and said Ukraine could reclaim its full territory with continued support.“After getting to know and fully understand the Ukraine/Russia Military and Economic situation and, after seeing the Economic trouble it is causing Russia, I think Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form,” he posted on Truth Social earlier.Vance highlighted the mounting casualties in the conflict, which began with Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, over 250,000 Russian soldiers and 60,000–100,000 Ukrainian troops have died.The UN reported more than 14,100 Ukrainian civilian deaths, while The Moscow Times cited over 620 Russian civilian fatalities, as per The Hill.“A lot of people are dying,” Vance said. “They don’t have a lot to show for it. How many more people are they willing to lose? How many more people are they willing to kill for very little, if any, gain in the military advantage on the ground there?”, he further added.The vice president also addressed Ukraine’s request for long-range Tomahawk missiles. While US officials are considering the request, Vance said President Trump will make the “final determination” on whether to approve the deal.Vance’s comments followed Trump’s meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, where the US president expressed optimism about Ukraine’s position and the possibility of future trilateral negotiations with Russia.",US Vice President JD Vance on Sunday said Russia must “wake up and accept reality” in its ongoing war against Ukraine.

US President Donald Trump is planning to meet with the top four congressional leaders at the White House on Monday, one day before the federal government faces a potential shutdown, a White House official and congressional sources confirmed.According to news agency AP , House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., along with house Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer will be attending the meeting.The development comes after Trump abruptly cancelled a planned meeting with Democratic leaders on Thursday at the urging of Johnson and Thune, calling Democratic demands “unserious and ridiculous”.The president has faced mounting pressure as the September 30 funding deadline approaches, with Congress needing to pass a spending bill to prevent a shutdown at 12:01 am (local time) on Wednesday.“President Trump has once again agreed to a meeting in the Oval Office,” Schumer and Jeffries said in a joint statement Saturday evening.“We are resolute in our determination to avoid a government shutdown and address the Republican healthcare crisis.Time is running out”, the statement added.Democrats are demanding key health care provisions be attached to any short-term funding measure, including an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies and the reversal of cuts to Medicaid included in earlier Republican legislation, as per AP.Republicans have rejected these conditions as nonstarters, insisting on a straight seven-week extension of current funding. GOP leaders have argued that health care and other policy discussions can occur separately from the emergency spending negotiations.Johnson previously acknowledged encouraging Trump not to meet Democratic leaders until they “do the basic governing work of keeping the government open”.Tensions have escalated in recent days, with the White House Office of Management and Budget instructing federal agencies to prepare reduction-in-force plans in case of a shutdown.A senior White House official described the administration’s approach bluntly and was quoted as saying by Politico, “We’re going to extract maximum pain… Democrats will pay a huge price for this”.Officials said Trump and his allies believe Democrats will be blamed for any disruptions, while GOP members are prepared to repeatedly force votes in the Senate.Despite the posturing, Democrats maintain that the president must negotiate to secure their votes.“In what world do you ask people for their votes without sitting down and having a conversation with them,” said Shalanda Young, former OMB director under President Biden, as per Politico.Every Senate Democrat, except for Pennsylvania’s John Fetterman, voted last week against a clean, seven-week funding measure backed by Republicans.The Monday meeting will be the latest effort to find common ground before federal agencies potentially halt nonessential operations, risking mass layoffs and service disruptions across the country.",US President Donald Trump is planning to meet with the top four congressional leaders at the White House on Monday.

Chaos in Portland: Ice Cube’s Tour Bus Torched After Being Mistaken for ICE Vehicle

What happened in Portland ?







President Donald Trump Saturday authorized military deployment in Portland to fight domestic terrorists, days after the city saw an increased presence of federal agents. “At the request of Secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, I am directing Secretary of War, Pete Hegseth, to provide all necessary Troops to protect War ravaged Portland, and any of our ICE Facilities under siege from attack by Antifa, and other domestic terrorists,” the president wrote in a post on Truth Social.“I am also authorizing Full Force, if necessary,” Trump added. “Thank you for your attention to this matter!”Earlier this week, Trump signed an order formally designating antifa as a domestic terrorist organization, giving the U.S. government a broad mandate to probe the anti-fascist movement’s operations or any instances where an antifa member “provided material support.”“Individuals associated with and acting on behalf of Antifa further coordinate with other organizations and entities for the purpose of spreading, fomenting, and advancing political violence and suppressing lawful political speech,” the White House said in the order that Trump signed on Monday.Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said late Friday that there were “credible” reports that federal agents “may be replaying the 2020 playbook and surging into Portland with the goal of provoking conflict and violence in my hometown,” adding that he was in “close” contact with local state officials.“Portland is a peaceful, vibrant city with no need for federal agents on our streets. I urge Oregonians not to fall into Trump’s attempt to incite violence,” Wyden said.“Just as I did in 2020, I will lead our delegation and state officials to oppose any unjustified increase in federal forces.”The official X handle of Portland called the increased presence of federal agents a 'bait' and asked people not to take the bait.""City and county leaders, congressional representatives and faith leaders hosted a press conference Friday night to discourage the federal government from escalating tension in Portland – and encourage Portlanders to voice their opinions peacefully,"" it said.“We need federal help. We need federal help to renew our infrastructure, and build affordable housing, to help clean our rivers and plant trees, and imagine the future of high-speed transportation,” said Mayor Keith Wilson. “Instead of help, they’re sending armored vehicles and masked men. If the federal government didn’t come to lend us a hand, then take a hike.”“We have a place at the table for everyone willing to lend a hand, the federal government included. However, we have no tolerance for anyone in Portland who uses this difficult moment to hurt people or damage our home.”","President Donald Trump authorized military deployment in Portland to fight domestic terrorists.

At least four people died in central Arizona after heavy rainfall caused flash flooding, officials said Saturday, with the hardest-hit areas including the historic mining town of Globe, about 88 miles east of Phoenix.Residents were forced to climb onto rooftops as floodwaters swept through downtown streets, overturning vehicles and scattering about 1,000 propane tanks from a local distributorship, as per news agency AP According to NBC News, Carl Melford, Gila County emergency manager, confirmed three deaths in Globe.“We now have a massive search and rescue underway,” he was quoted as saying by AP, noting that authorities were investigating reports of possibly missing residents.In Scottsdale, the fourth victim was identified as 38-year-old Ander Polanco, whose vehicle had been submerged in approximately eight feet of fast-moving water on Friday evening; his body was found Saturday after the waters receded, reported NBC News.The flooding in Globe, a city of around 7,250 residents, occurred after roughly 2.5 inches (6.4 centimetres) of rain fell within 24 hours.Another storm moved in on Saturday, temporarily halting search efforts due to high-flowing creeks.Streets in the nearby mining town of Miami were also flooded, though no injuries were reported there, according to Melford.Mayor Al Gameros said the damage to downtown Globe was extensive, with buildings compromised and hazardous materials, including propane tanks, strewn across the area.“Our primary, again, is search and rescue,” he said. Officials cautioned residents to avoid floodwaters, as volunteer interference could hinder rescue dogs from locating victims.Social media videos showed vehicles being swept away, some smashed against poles, with muddy water carrying debris through the city.Mike Stapleton, Globe’s vice mayor, described reports of trapped residents, including a pregnant woman who had to swim out of a flooded restaurant, and called the devastation “just unbelievable”.Council member Freddy Rios said, “This is something that we could never even imagine, and here we are living it”.Rescue operations included teams from neighbouring counties and the state.Authorities also evacuated about 20 tourists stranded on the Havasupai Indian Reservation, including at scenic Havasu Falls.The National Weather Service reported between 1 and 2 inches of rainfall across metropolitan Phoenix on Friday, including 1.6 inches at the city airport, the highest single-day total in seven years.Hail larger than an inch was observed in some areas, and some self-driving vehicles at Phoenix airport were stuck in floodwaters.Globe city council members declared a state of emergency and urged residents to stay away from downtown until it was deemed safe.Authorities were checking vehicles among debris and assessing structural damage to ensure bridges over local creeks remained stable, as per the New York Times.With further storms expected, officials warned of continued flash flooding risks across Globe, Miami, and neighbouring communities, emphasising the importance of remaining in safe locations until conditions improved.","Floodwaters swept through downtown streets, overturning vehicles and scattering about 1,000 propane tanks from a local distributorship.

Trump said through a post on Truth Social.Trump has previously described the room as needing “a little life” and noted the challenge of making gold paint look like real gold, as reported by Fox News.Despite this, Trump continued the refurbishments in the following months, increasing the use of gold throughout the office. Gold trim was added to the ceiling, door frames, and fireplace, while sculpted cherubim inside the door frames were also painted gold.During his administration, the number of gold trophies and vases on the mantle increased, and gold coasters bearing Trump’s name were added.A White House spokesperson said that the gold, described as “of the highest quality,” was purchased personally by Trump, as per Fox News.Trump also expanded the number of paintings on display in the Oval Office, with nearly 20 portraits of former presidents adorning the walls. By comparison, his predecessor Joe Biden displayed six paintings, while Barack Obama had only two.To assist with the project, Trump reportedly enlisted the help of his personal “gold guy.”John Icart, a 70-year-old cabinet maker from Florida, was flown to Washington on Air Force One to replicate the gilded flourishes he had added to Trump’s Palm Beach residence, Mar-a-Lago, as reported by the Guardian.The ornate gold carvings Icart installed in the Oval Office led White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt to describe it as a “golden office for the golden age.”","US President Donald Trump praised the 24-karat gold in the Oval Office and Cabinet Room of the White House.

New York City mayor Eric Adams has ended his reelection bid, paving the way for a three-way race between Queens Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, former Governor Andrew Cuomo, and Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa to lead the nation’s largest city.Adams, who assumed office in January 2022, announced his withdrawal through a video posted on social media on Sunday, though his name will still remain on the November ballot.""It has been my honor to be your mayor,"" he said.Speculation about Adams’ political future had intensified in recent months, with most polls showing him in single digits, trailing Mamdani, Cuomo, and Sliwa. He was also facing a corruption scandal and criticism over his ties to the Trump administration, as cited by CBS News.On September 5, reports emerged that the Trump administration was considering Adams for the role of US ambassador to Saudi Arabia. Adams responded that he had not received a formal offer and remained committed to serving as New York City’s mayor.Earlier in 2025, the Justice Department, under Trump, intervened to drop federal corruption charges against Adams, which alleged he solicited and accepted illegal gifts and campaign contributions from wealthy foreign donors, including the Turkish government, as reported by USA Today.The mayor previously dismissed speculation that he might abandon his reelection campaign. He also emphasised that he is the only one who can defeat Mandani.“I am in this race. And I am the only one who can beat Mamdani,"" Adams said.Trump commented on the broader mayoral race earlier, suggesting that Cuomo would stand a better chance against Zohran Mamdani in a head-to-head contest. However, he noted that with multiple candidates in the race, defeating Mamdani would be difficult.Trump has previously expressed opposition to Mamdani, 33, becoming mayor of New York City, and said he would prefer that Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa step aside to allow a direct matchup against Mamdani.","Eric Adams, who assumed office in January 2022, announced his withdrawal through a video posted on social media on Sunday.

'Arrest War Criminal': Times Square Explodes Against Netanyahu As Israeli PM Defends Gaza War





US President Donald Trump on Sunday suggested a ""major development"" could be imminent in the Middle East , declaring there is “something special” in the works.“We have a real chance for GREATNESS IN THE MIDDLE EAST. ALL ARE ON BOARD FOR SOMETHING SPECIAL, FIRST TIME EVER. WE WILL GET IT DONE!!!” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.While he gave no details, the announcement could relate to the Israel–Hamas conflict, which his administration has been attempting to resolve since he began his second term in January.Trump's post comes on the eve of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to the White House.On Friday, dozens of nations walked out as Netanyahu addressed the UN General Assembly, while some delegates applauded. Outside, thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters blocked Times Square. Netanyahu defended Israel’s actions against Hamas, condemned recognition of a Palestinian state, and vowed not to accept a “terrorist state.” He claimed private support from world leaders, addressed hostages in Gaza, and broadcast his speech into the enclave via loudspeakers at the border.He is scheduled to visit the White House on Monday.Hamas carried out the worst-ever attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, killing 1,219 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally from Israeli official figures, in the deadliest day in the country's history.The Palestinian militants also took 251 hostages, of which 47 remain in Gaza, including 25 the Israeli military says are dead.Israel's offensive has killed more than 65,549 Palestinians, also mostly civilians, according to health ministry figures in the Hamas-run territory.

Amid Trump-Sharif Meeting, Political Expert Explains Why US is Eyeing Pakistan As Military Launchpad





: In an effort to worm its way back into Washington’s good books, Pakistan ’s hybrid military-civilian leadership flashed glimpses of its purported rare earths bearing mineral wealth during a meeting with US President Donald Trump last week, going by a photo released by the White House.Among a dozen photos featured in the White House picture gallery relating to the Shahbaz Sharif- Asim Munir meeting with Trump is one where the duo is showing Trump an open 18x18 inch wooden box with colorful stones presumably bearing some mineral deposits. Two of the larger rocks appear to be bastanzite and monazite clumps that typically bear rare earths elements (REE) such as cerium, lanthanum, and neodymium. Some of the smaller candy-colored pebbles look like gemstones.Pakistan has long spoken of its vast untapped oil, gas, and mineral ores, some bearing rare earths, mostly in the troubled Balochistan region wracked with insurgency, and also in Khyber-Pakhtoonwa. While none of the mineral deposits are commercially proven or quantified, Pakistan’s leadership showcased the baubles to the US President to highlight collaboration and exploration bids it has signed with a private US firm earlier this month.The charm offensive also included PM Sharif wearing a lapel pin the had both the US and Pakistani flags, a gesture some Pakistani trolls on social media termed as “embarrassing.”While there is no direct government-to-government agreement to explore or exploit the mineral wealth, Pakistan's Frontier Works Organization (FWO)—a military-linked engineering and mining entity—signed an MoU on September 8 with the Missouri-based US Strategic Metals (USSM), a private US firm specializing in critical minerals.The agreement, with an initial funding of $ 500 million from USSM, envisages three phases: Phase 1 (Immediate, 2025–2026) involving export of readily available minerals (e.g., antimony and copper concentrates) to US markets, generating quick revenue. Phase 2 (Medium-term, 2026–2028) involving construction of processing plants and refineries in Pakistan, with technology transfer for REE separation and purification. Phase 3 (Long-term, 2028+), involving large-scale exploration and exploitation, including drilling in high-potential REE belts; and developing 5–10 mining projects.Islamabad's rare earths gambit with the US — which could cause Pakistan's patron China to burst a blood vessel since it has a stranglehold on rare earths supply to the US — comes on the heels of the its crypto caper, where it used a British-Pakistani entrepreneur to position itself as crypto capital where American businesses with ties to the Trump family could make a fortune.","Pakistan has long spoken of its vast untapped oil, gas, and mineral ores, some bearing rare earths.

NEW YORK: Despite being among one of the world's worst performers when it comes to democracy, and registering a high number of human rights violation cases, Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif defended the country's 'hybrid model' of governance where the army and civilian leadership work hand in glove in running the country.He made the remarks in an interview to British-American journalist Mehdi Hasan while defending Pakistan. Asif called the US democracy a ""deep state"" and tried to brush away the charges of military might in Pak governance.When asked by Hasan, ""It's a strange system you have in Pakistan.

That's what the accusation is"", Asif put the blame on past leadership, stating, ""You can say that because of our military rulers - it is more visible...""On being further probed as to where the power lies in Pakistan, the defence minister explained it as ""hybrid"".Earlier this year, Asif had told Arab News about the 'hybrid regime' that currently runs the country, Dawn reported.

A substantial cache of arms and ammunition was recovered from the scene. Three security personnel sustained injuries in the firefight.The slain militants were reportedly wanted for multiple crimes, including attacks on security forces, kidnapping for ransom, and other terrorist activities.

Awkward contradictions on Imran Khan







Pakistan's defence minister, Khawaja Asif , has once again defended his country's ""hybrid model"" of governance, insisting that the military and civilian leadership work ""by consensus"" in managing state affairs.Speaking to British-American journalist Mehdi Hasan, Asif dismissed suggestions that the army dominates Pakistan's politics, while controversially describing US democracy as a ""deep state.""When asked whether Pakistan's generals hold more power than elected ministers, Asif retorted, ""No, it's not like that. I'm a political appointee, I’m a political worker."" Pressed further with comparisons to the United States, where civilian leaders have the authority to dismiss top generals, he claimed, ""They (the US) have a different model over here. It's called deep state.""Hasan pointed out that in Pakistan, critics accuse the military of being the real decision-maker. Asif acknowledged the perception, blaming ""past military rulers"" for the image, but insisted the system was based on consensus. Asked directly who prevails if he and Army chief Asim Munir disagree, Asif said: ""It's not equal. We can agree to disagree. It is by consensus, whatever is taking place.""Earlier this year, Asif had described the hybrid arrangement as a ""practical necessity,"" saying that while not an ideal form of democracy, it was helping Pakistan manage its economic and governance crises. Local daily Dawn has reported that Asif often praises the military-civilian partnership, despite critics branding it undemocratic.Turning to geopolitics, Asif insisted Pakistan's tilt toward Washington under US President Donald Trump, with new mineral and crypto trade deals, would not jeopardise Islamabad's ties with Beijing. ""We are not worried about that, because it's a time-tested relationship with China since the late 50s. China is not worried about our flirtations or whatever you call it,"" he remarked.Highlighting defence ties, he said: ""In the past, even today and in the future also, China has been a very reliable ally. Our Air Force, submarines, planes — almost a major portion of our arms are from China, and our defence cooperation is increasing. It is much more robust than before, with China, the main reason is unreliability of other sources like the United States.""He underscored geography as another factor: ""They (China) are reliable and they are our neighbours. We share borders and we share the geography.""The interview also turned uncomfortable when Asif was confronted about his shifting claims on jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan's social media activity. At one point, he alleged Khan was operating his account from Adiala Jail. When reminded that he had earlier accused India of controlling Khan's account, Asif appeared flustered.""You just made two different allegations. Is it Imran in his prison cell or is it India?"" Hasan asked. Asif responded, ""Either he is operating from the cell or he should at least identify who is operating the jail cell.""Pressed further on evidence, Asif cited ""intelligence sources"" but refused to provide details, insisting: ""The evidence I cannot publicly disclose… but it is there.""","Pakistan's defence minister defends country's ""hybrid model"" of governance.

US President Donald Trump is expected to meet Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif at the White House on Thursday, a Trump administration official told Reuters on Wednesday.The meeting comes weeks after the two countries agreed to a trade deal and follows a brief encounter between the leaders at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.US-Pakistan ties have warmed in recent months under Trump, even as Washington’s relations with New Delhi have been tested over issues such as visa hurdles, high tariffs imposed on Indian goods, and Trump’s repeated claims that he brokered an India-Pakistan ceasefire in May.The United States and Pakistan announced a trade deal on July 31, including a 19% tariff rate imposed by Washington.However, US has yet to reach a similar trade agreement with India.Donald Trump previously hosted Pakistani army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir at the White House, marking the first time a US president met the head of Pakistan’s army without senior civilian officials. “We're working through a number of issues when it comes to counter-terrorism, when it comes to economic and trade ties,” a senior State Department official said. “And so the president remains focused on advancing US interests in the region, that includes through engaging with Pakistan and their government leaders.Asked about frictions with India, the official told Reuters, “Trump believed in being frank about frustrations in ties but the relationship was strong. Washington viewed New Delhi as a good friend and partner and believed their relationship would define the 21st century.” The official added that planning continues for a summit of the Quad grouping of India, Australia, Japan and the United States, expected either later this year or early next year.Sharif also met Trump on Tuesday on the sidelines of the UNGA in a meeting hosted alongside Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, attended by leaders from Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Egypt, the UAE, and Jordan. According to Pakistan’s foreign office, “Informal exchange followed the dialogue between President Trump and leaders of eight Islamic-Arab countries, including Pakistan.” The meeting focused on exploring diplomatic, political, and humanitarian options for de-escalating the conflict in Gaza.Washington said it shared peace proposals with leaders from those countries during the meeting. Pakistan has backed Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for his claimed efforts in easing India-Pakistan tensions, although Islamabad has criticised Israel’s operations in Gaza.Donald Trump addressed the UNGA for the first time since returning to the Oval Office, claiming he had ended seven wars in seven months, including the conflict between India and Pakistan.",US President Donald Trump is expected to meet Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif at the White House on Thursday.
