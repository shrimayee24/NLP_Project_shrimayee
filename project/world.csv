Musk vs Trump: Did Vivek Ramaswamy 'Doge' a bullet by getting out in time?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/musk-vs-trump-did-vivek-ramaswamy-doge-a-bullet-by-getting-out-in-time/articleshow/121664165.cms,"Trump WIPES OUT Elon Musk's $15 BILLION In Just 6 Minutes; Tesla Shares Tank, MAYHEM At Wall Street

Elon Musk EXPOSES Donald Trump-Epstein Link From 1992 Video: Mar-a-Lago Tapes Go Viral





In Washington’s latest episode of Tech Titans vs MAGA Caesar, D onald Trump has turned on Elon Musk —his former bromantic partner-in-disruption, SpaceX messiah, and self-appointed guardian of Western civilisation. The trigger? Musk labelled Trump’s much-hyped One Big Beautiful Bill “a disgusting abomination” and warned that America was hurtling toward “debt slavery. ”Trump, never one to take offence lightly—or privately—responded with a MAGA-flavoured blitzkrieg. Contracts for Musk’s companies? At risk. His reputation in conservative circles? Torched. “Just another whiny billionaire,” Trump sneered, “who forgot who made him matter.”As the Trump-Musk bromance dissolves faster than a Tesla on Autopilot in Washington traffic, one man watches the fireworks from a safe, well-lit distance—sipping Perrier, adjusting his campaign blazer, and thanking his stars he got out early, having clearly absorbed Sun Tzu’s timeless wisdom: “The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.”—Vivek Ramaswamy.Also read: 'Disgusting abomination' to 'bombshell': Trump & Musk feud spirals; timeline of the public meltdown Once the philosophical darling of the new right, Ramaswamy was handed a shiny new toy in Trump’s second term—DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency.A meme-ified federal Frankenstein, DOGE was Trump’s idea of bureaucratic reform through Silicon Valley swagger. Musk was the co-head. Vivek was the “sane one.” Together, they were meant to revolutionise Washington. Or at least yell at it until it agreed to be disrupted.But like any startup built on vibes and vague mission statements, DOGE began to implode before it launched. Musk wanted to fire half of Washington via app. Trump wanted press conferences with golden eagles and fog machines. And Vivek? Vivek quietly disappeared.Officially, he left to run for Ohio governor. Unofficially, insiders suggest he saw the writing on the Twitter wall —that DOGE was less a reform movement and more a digital kamikaze mission, powered by ego, caffeine, and libertarian hallucinations.And now, in hindsight, his exit looks less like a career pivot and more like a Sun Tzu manoeuvre. Because while Musk is now battling Trump, Congress, and his own booster-fuelled paranoia, Ramaswamy is free to reinvent himself as a centrist tech-whisperer in the Rust Belt. MAGA enough to get the base. Moderate enough to avoid the madness.Except MAGA, like any self-devouring revolution, doesn’t forget. Or forgive.Since stepping away from DOGE and softening his Trumpian rhetoric, Ramaswamy has found himself in the crosshairs of the same base that once anointed him their biotech Brahmin. Hardcore influencers have branded him a traitor. Conservative meme accounts now photoshop him next to Liz Cheney. And in the subterranean rage economy of right-wing internet culture, he's been rebranded from “America First entrepreneur” to “globalist plant with a Harvard tongue. ”Also read: Feud intensifies: Musk shares 1992 video; Trump seen with Jeffrey Epstein in clip The irony? The same mob now grilling Ramaswamy for “disloyalty” is turning on Musk for “disrespect.” In MAGAland, loyalty is a zero-sum blood sport, and the only acceptable exit is the one through public execution.DOGE, predictably, has become a political punchline. It was doomed from conception—run like a Reddit thread, branded like a crypto coin, and staffed by men who confuse spreadsheets with scripture. The only surprising thing is how quickly it crashed. Musk thought he could out-Trump Trump. But in MAGA-land, there can only be one sun god—and he’s orange, not emerald-mined.Ramaswamy, to his credit, didn’t wait around to become collateral damage. He understood what Musk didn’t: that proximity to Trump is radioactive. Stay too long and you mutate. Get out early and you might just survive.The result? Musk is in political freefall. Trump is in attack mode. And Ramaswamy? He’s in Ohio, sipping Perrier and talking about “innovation in public policy”—while ducking MAGA Twitter grenades and hoping they forget he ever existed.Call it foresight. Call it cowardice. Or just call it good political hygiene.Because as Sun Tzu said—he will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight.And in the dystopian sitcom that is American politics, that makes Vivek Ramaswamy the guy who ghosted the group chat before the firestorm—and lived to run another episode.","Vivek Ramaswamy was the co-head of DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency.

NEW DELHI: In a dramatic turn of events, Canadian PM Mark Carney called PM Modi and invited him for the G7 summit that begins eight days from now at Kananaskis in Alberta. Modi accepted the invitation and said he was looking forward to meeting him at the summit.The announcement by Modi on X followed almost a week of suspense over his participation because of a lack of invitation, drawing barbs from the opposition about his possible exclusion from the summit. India is not a member of G7 but Modi has been invited for all summits since 2019. Modi congratulated Carney on his poll win and thanked him for the invitation.As vibrant democracies bound by deep people-to-people ties, India and Canada will work together with renewed vigour, guided by mutual respect and shared interests,"" Modi posted on X.Without elaborating, a Canadian readout said that ""importantly, there was agreement to continued law enforcement dialogue and discussions addressing security concerns"".Modi and Carney, who was sworn in as PM in March and won federal elections the next month to cement his position, have pledged to rebuild the relationship that was left tottering by former PM Justin Trudeau's allegation of India's complicity in the murder of pro-Khalistan separatist and Canadian national Hardeep Singh Nijjar.New Delhi has rejected the allegation saying Ottawa hasn't provided any evidence to back its claim.The Indian govt will hope that Canada will ensure enough security to not allow Sikh separatist groups, who had been applying pressure on Carney to not invite Modi, to disrupt the visit. India's official position remains that the main issue with Canada is the leeway provided to Khalistan backers to carry out anti-India activities. For India to engage in any serious effort to rebuild the relationship, foolproof security for the country's diplomats, along with a crackdown on extremists and secessionists who seek to hurt Indian interests, is of paramount importance.Modi had last visited Canada in 2015. While the two countries are also said to be considering reappointing high commissioners, both Canadian and Indian authorities maintain they are looking at repairing ties one step at a time. Asked about the Nijjar investigations, Canadian foreign minister Anita Anand said last week that while the rule of law will never be compromised, Canada is looking forward to continuing to build this partnership.""The two leaders discussed the longstanding relationship between Canada and India, including deep people-to-people ties and significant commercial links,'' said the Canadian readout. The summit will also see Modi coming face to face with US President Donald Trump for the first time since their bilateral meeting in Washington in February this year.This will be Modi's first visit abroad since the military conflict with Pakistan and the PM is likely to use the opportunity to highlight India's concerns about Pakistan's continued support to cross-border terrorism and India's use of force to prevent terrorist attacks.",Canadian PM Mark Carney called PM Modi and invited him for the G7 summit.

He added that the election commission will soon present a detailed election roadmap.According to the state-run Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS), Yunus reiterated that the government had previously indicated the elections would be held between December 2025 and June 2026. ""We are taking every necessary measure to ensure the country is ready to hold free and credible elections during this window,” he said.The 84-year-old caretaker leader acknowledged widespread anticipation over the poll date, emphasising that Bangladesh’s political crises since independence have often stemmed from flawed elections.“Through repeated manipulation of elections, a political party turned into a fascist regime. Those who orchestrated those sham elections were branded as criminals by the people. The regimes that emerged from them were ultimately rejected by the public,” Yunus said.He stressed that the government's primary responsibility is to ensure the upcoming elections are ""clean, festive, peaceful, and widely participatory,"" so the nation does not fall into yet another cycle of crisis. “Institutional reform is key. If we fail to ensure good governance in institutions tied to the electoral process, all the sacrifices made by our students and citizens will be in vain,” he warned.Yunus said his administration operates on three key mandates: reform, justice, and elections. “I believe we will reach significant milestones in justice and institutional reform by Eid al-Fitr,” he said, citing visible progress in the prosecution of crimes against humanity, particularly those committed during the July uprising.He also expressed confidence in holding “the most free, fair, competitive, and credible election in the country’s history,” adding, “We want an election that honors the martyrs of the uprising and brings peace to their souls.”Yunus emphasised the importance of maximum participation: “We want the largest number of voters, candidates, and parties in this election. Let it be remembered as the most impartial election in Bangladesh’s history. After more than a century and a half, a truly representative parliament will be formed, and millions of young people will vote for the first time.”Calling on citizens to engage proactively, Yunus urged voters to seek firm commitments from all political parties and candidates: that they will uphold the reform agenda agreed upon by consensus in the next parliament; protect Bangladesh’s independence, sovereignty, and dignity; and never compromise the people’s democratic rights.He also called for pledges of clean governance: “Ask them to promise they will lead with honesty and transparency, rejecting corruption, partisanship, extortion, syndicates, and any form of anti-people activity.”Yunus concluded by framing the upcoming election as more than a political event: “This is not just a vote — it’s a chance to build a New Bangladesh. While familiar parties and symbols will appear on the ballot, it is up to the people to choose candidates truly committed to your hopes and your future.”","Bangladesh will hold its first election since last year’s mass uprising that toppled the Sheikh Hasina government, interim leader Muhammad Yunus announced.

22-year-old to lead DHS office: Trump picks ex-gardener Thomas Fugate to head prevention team; MAGA ties and little experience in security,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/22-year-old-to-lead-dhs-office-trump-picks-ex-gardener-thomas-fugate-to-head-prevention-team-maga-ties-and-little-experience-in-security/articleshow/121664094.cms,"Thomas Fugate (Image credits: X @justicemalala)





Thomas Fugate, a 22-year-old with a background in gardening and grocery store work, has been appointed by US President Donald Trump to head the center for prevention programs and partnerships (CP3) at the department of homeland Security (DHS).Just five years ago, Fugate was working as a neighborhood gardener. As recently as August 2023, he held a job at a grocery store. A 2023 graduate of the University of Texas at San Antonio, Fugate has experienced a swift rise through Republican political circles.Fugate’s LinkedIn page shows limited experience in the national security or policy field. In 2020, he listed himself as a self-employed “landscape business owner.” He also worked as a “cross functional team member” at an H-E-B supermarket in Austin, Texas.After completing his degree in politics and law, Fugate joined Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign as an “advance team member.” He has also interned at the conservative Heritage foundation and with Texas state representatives Terry Wilson and Steve Allison.In February, he was reportedly hired as a special assistant in an immigration office at DHS.Following the resignation of the previous CP3 director, Fugate was named as the acting head of the center.“Tom Fugate has performed well in his current role as a confidential assistant in our immigration & border security suboffice,” a DHS official told The Daily Beast.“Due to his success, he has been temporarily given additional leadership responsibilities in the center for prevention programs and partnerships office (CP3). This is a credit to his work ethic and success on the job.”Earlier posts from his X account show a different tone, one of interest in global aid, LEGO, Star Wars, and international development. In past tweets, he encouraged Texas lawmakers to support the international affairs budget and aid for the global poor.Fugate later shifted toward a MAGA-aligned political image, rebranding himself with the “thomas4texas” Instagram handle and announcing his entry into public service. His online profiles reflect a carefully constructed persona, including a LinkedIn photo in front of the DHS seal, hinting at confidence and ambition.His rapid promotion has sparked questions about experience and readiness, but DHS officials have stood by the decision, citing his work ethic and current performance.","Thomas Fugate, a 22-year-old with a background in gardening and grocery store work, has been appointed by US President Donald Trump to head the department of homeland Security.

Republican leader Vivek Ramaswamy faced another round of vicious trolling for no reason while the MAGA world imploded with Donald Trump and Elon Musk attacking each other in public.

At that time, Ramaswamy was a co-chief of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. Elon Musk too backed Ramaswamy on H1-B but did not like his unraveling and eventually Ramaswamy exited DOGE even before Trump's inauguration.Ramaswamy announced his bid for Ohio Governor race, got the backing of both Elon Musk and Donald Trump but gradually distanced himself from the White House.As the Trump-Musk feud unfolded, Ramaswamy posted a photo carrying his two children -- Karthik and Arjun and wrote: 'It's why we do it'.

As Muslims across the United Arab Emirates prepare to celebrate Eid al-Adha, one of the most important festivals in the Islamic calendar, the General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowments has officially announced the prayer timings for cities and regions across the country. Eid al-Adha prayers are held shortly after sunrise, typically around 15 to 20 minutes later. The timing varies slightly depending on the location. To help worshippers plan accordingly, here is a comprehensive list of prayer times according to Gulf News in each emirate and region for this auspicious occasion.Eid al-Adha, or the “Festival of Sacrifice,” commemorates the willingness of Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) to sacrifice his son in obedience to God. It marks the end of the Hajj pilgrimage in Mecca and is celebrated with special prayers, family gatherings, charity, and the ritual sacrifice of animals. The meat is shared with family, friends, and those in need. The festival serves as a reminder of faith, selflessness, and devotion to God's command.","Eid al-Adha, or the “Festival of Sacrifice,” commemorates the willingness of Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) to sacrifice his son in obedience to God.

Columbia University alumnus, currently facing deportation due to his pro-Palestinian activism, has detailed the significant ""irreparable harm"" due to his ongoing detention to his personal and professional life, while a federal judge considers his release.In court documents made public on Thursday, Mahmoud Khalil described how the “most immediate and visceral harms” due to his detention in Louisiana was him missing the birth of his firstborn in April, reported the Associated Press. ""Instead of holding my wife's hand in the delivery room, I was crouched on a detention centre floor, whispering through a crackling phone line as she laboured alone,"" the 30-year-old legal US resident wrote. ""When I heard my son's first cries, I buried my face in my arms so no one would see me weep.""The detention has severely affected his professional prospects, with Oxfam International withdrawing their employment offer for a policy adviser position.Additionally, his mother's visa application to assist with his newborn's care is currently under federal scrutiny. ""As someone who fled prosecution in Syria for my political beliefs, for who I am, I never imagined myself to be in immigration detention, here in the United States,"" he wrote. ""Why should protesting this Israel government's indiscriminate killing of thousands of innocent Palestinians result in the erosion of my constitutional rights?""The Department of Homeland Security's spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin, suggested Khalil utilise the CBP Home app for voluntary deportation, offering $1,000 and complimentary travel.Despite Khalil's green card status, the Trump administration is proceeding with its revocation. His lawyers submitted a 13-page statement alongside various legal declarations highlighting the extensive consequences of his arrest.His wife, Dr Noor Abdalla, a US citizen, described managing childbirth and early parenthood without her husband's support.Columbia's academic community expressed concerns about the dampening effect on campus activism, noting increased hesitancy to participate in protests or groups critical of the Trump administration.Recently, New Jersey Federal Judge Michael Farbiarz indicated that the administration's deportation effort likely contravenes the Constitution. Farbiarz noted that using potential threats to US foreign policy as justification for removal could enable arbitrary enforcement.Khalil's arrest occurred on March 8 in his university accommodation's lobby, marking the first detention under Trump's expanded measures against students involved in Gaza war protests.","Mahmoud Khalil, 30, has detailed the significant ""irreparable harm"" to his personal and professional life, while a federal judge considers his release.

Gautam Gambhir sends stern message after Bengaluru tragedy





A devastating incident occurred aboard the Chhattisgarh Express when a 38-year-old disabled cricketer, Vikram Singh from Punjab, reportedly passed away while travelling from Delhi to Gwalior for a wheelchair cricket tournament. Singh’s health suddenly deteriorated during the journey, and despite numerous emergency calls, medical assistance failed to arrive in time.He passed away before the train reached Mathura station, despite repeated efforts to secure help.Singh and his teammates had boarded the Chhattisgarh Express from Hazrat Nizamuddin station on Wednesday night. He began experiencing severe pain shortly after departure, and his condition worsened rapidly as the train approached Mathura.According to reports, an emergency call was made to the railway helpline at 4:58 am, urgently requesting medical support. Despite several follow-up calls, no help materialised.The train was delayed by approximately 90 minutes and eventually reached Mathura station at 8:10 am. By then, Singh had already passed away.“He was in pain in front of our eyes. We kept calling for help, but it never came,” recounted one of his distraught teammates.At Mathura Junction, Government Railway Police (GRP) officials removed Singh’s body and arranged for a postmortem. The GRP has initiated formal proceedings, while railway authorities have launched an internal investigation into the delayed response.The incident has brought to light serious concerns about the effectiveness of Indian Railways ’ emergency medical systems.“This is not just a tragedy but a glaring reminder of the gaps in our railway medical emergency response,” said a senior player who was travelling with Vikram.The tragedy has prompted widespread outrage from disability rights advocates and the sporting community, who are questioning Indian Railways' ability to adequately support differently-abled passengers in emergency situations—especially when timely intervention is critical.","Disabled cricketer Vikram Singh, 38, died aboard the Chhattisgarh Express.

US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents on Friday carried out a series of immigration sweeps, including two Home Depots, that sparked a tense standoff between the official and demonstrators.Approximately 500 demonstrators walked through streets near the federal building, displaying pro-immigrant banners and flags, following a rally organised by the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA) on Los Angeles Street.LAPD declared the protest an unlawful assembly at 7 pm, instructing participants to leave or face arrest.Immigrant advocates confirmed to CNN that authorities detained a minimum of 45 individuals without warrants at seven different sites. The arrests occurred at two Home Depot locations, a fashion district establishment and a doughnut shop, according to Angelica Salas, executive director for the Coalition of Humane Immigrant Rights, or CHIRLA, at an afternoon press conference denouncing the activity.""If our constitutional rights are violated, if our due process is violated, then anybody's rights can be violated,"" said Salas. She added, ""If you think you are protected because you're not a immigration, I'm here to tell you what's happening in our country is unprecedented.""The protest erupted following an immigration enforcement incident at a San Diego eatery. Similarly, demonstrations occurred in Minneapolis when federal agents wearing tactical equipment entered a Latino community. The officials clarified that their presence was related to a criminal investigation rather than immigration enforcement matters.During the demonstration, some participants defaced the federal building with graffiti, prompting law enforcement to respond with smoke bombs, Los Angeles Times reported.A large crowd gathered near the Los Angeles Federal Building at 4 pm to protest against the enforcement action, condemning the crackdown. The demonstrators called for the freedom of Service Employees International Union California President David Huerta. According to the labour union's statement, Huerta sustained injuries and was taken into custody while recording documentation of the raid.Huerta, aged 58, received medical attention at a hospital before being moved to the Metropolitan Detention Centre in central L.A. According to a spokesperson from SEIU, he was still in custody at 5.30 pm.“What happened to me is not about me; This is about something much bigger,” he said in a statement from the hospital. “This is about how we as a community stand together and resist the injustice that’s happening. Hard-working people, and members of our family and our community, are being treated like criminals. We all collectively have to object to this madness because this is not justice.”In a post on X, US Attorney Bill Essayli stated that Huerta had intentionally prevented federal agents from accessing a worksite where they were serving a warrant by obstructing their vehicle on Friday morning. According to Essayli, Huerta was taken into custody for allegedly interfering with federal officers and is scheduled for arraignment on Monday.""Federal agents were executing a lawful judicial warrant at a LA worksite this morning when David Huerta deliberately obstructed their access by blocking their vehicle. He was arrested for interfering with federal officers and will face arraignment in federal court on Monday,"" he said.""Let me be clear: I don’t care who you are—if you impede federal agents, you will be arrested and prosecuted. No one has the right to assault, obstruct, or interfere with federal authorities carrying out their duties,"" he added.In Los Angeles, onlookers and news teams recorded footage showing federal agents escorting individuals across a Home Depot car park, whilst confrontations occurred at additional detention locations.KTLA aired overhead shots depicting agents outside a fashion district apparel shop, guiding detainees towards two large white vans stationed in the parking area. The detained persons had their hands bound behind them. The agents conducted body searches before placing them in the vehicles. The officers wore protective gear displaying the letters FBI, ICE and HSI (Homeland Security Investigations).Armed personnel utilised yellow police cordons to maintain distance between the public and the enforcement activities.Protesters assembled outside Ambiance Apparel's warehouse, offering legal guidance to those detained within. They positioned themselves atop a long bed truck in the street, causing traffic disruptions on the busy thoroughfare.""You are not alone,"" one said into a megaphone drowning out the sounds of the crowd. ""Do not sign anything. Do not tell them where you are from.""Eighteen-year-old Katina Garcia peered through the glass, searching for her undocumented father who had arrived for his regular workday that morning, Ls Angeles Times reported.""We never thought it would happen to us,"" she said, ""I'm in disbelief.""Following a two-hour period, numerous federal agents in riot equipment arrived at Ambiance Apparel to address the growing crowd of over 100 people outside.Their convoy of armoured vehicles announced their presence with blaring sirens. ""Pigs,"" someone called out during the chaotic situation. ""Fascists,"" came another voice.ICE agents emerged and encircled the entrances that demonstrators attempted to obstruct. Several protesters hurled items towards the armed officers whilst shouting and recording the incident. Officers deployed pepper spray to scatter the assembled crowd.Officers who were stationed inside the establishment escorted approximately twelve people out and loaded them into waiting vehicles, while additional personnel in protective equipment cordoned off the surrounding area.Overhead video captured by KABC-TV depicted officers deploying smoke bombs or flash bangs onto the roadway to clear the gathering, enabling their departure in SUVs, vans and military-style transport vehicles.The LAPD and LA County Sheriff's Department issued announcements acknowledging their awareness of Friday's immigration enforcement activities. Both organisations clarified their stance of non-participation in civil immigration enforcement and confirmed they would not investigate anyone's immigration status.""We want our residents to know that when they call for help, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department will respond, investigate and protect everyone — regardless of a person's legal status,"" the department said in a statement.Union del Barrio and the Community Self-Defense Coalition planned additional protests Friday evening in downtown LA against raids and deportations that are ""terrorizing people.""“Continued chaotic federal sweeps, across California, to meet an arbitrary arrest quota are as reckless as they are cruel,” Newsom said. “Donald Trump’s chaos is eroding trust, tearing families apart, and undermining the workers and industries that power America’s economy.”LAPD reported their officers were called to assist with a ""large, unruly group"" in downtown LA, though they had not officially declared an unlawful assembly by Friday evening.","Immigrant advocates confirmed to CNN that authorities detained a minimum of 45 individuals without warrants at seven different sites.

RUDRAPUR: A man allegedly murdered his wife in a brutal attack following a domestic dispute over infidelity suspicion in Mundwakheda village of Jaspur, Udham Singh Nagar district. The accused, 35-year-old Rahul Singh, was arrested on Monday.Police said Rahul and his wife, Neema, 32, lived separately from his parents in Madua Kheda village. The couple had a son and a daughter, who were recently sent to their maternal grandmother’s home in Amritpur under the Rehda police station limits.On Saturday night, a heated argument broke out between the two, after which Rahul attacked Neema. He first hit her with a pressure cooker and then used a sharp weapon to slit her throat, hands, and legs, causing massive blood loss. Neema died on the spot. Rahul fled the scene after the murder.The next morning, Rahul’s mother informed the police. A forensic team collected evidence from the spot, and the body was sent for postmortem.

In one of the heaviest aerial bombardments of the war, Russia launched over 400 drones and 40 missiles across Ukraine overnight, killing at least six people and injuring around 80 others on Friday.Footage of the assault showed missiles slamming into the ground, lighting up the night sky with deafening booms and fiery explosions.The devastating attack came days after Kyiv carried out a drone strike on Russian airfields, and just hours after US President Donald Trump said Moscow would likely retaliate.The assault lasted several hours and hit six Ukrainian regions, including 407 drones and 44 ballistic and cruise missiles, according to Ukrainian air force spokesperson Yurii Ihnat. Ukrainian defences shot down roughly 30 missiles and up to 200 drones. The barrage killed emergency workers in Kyiv and civilians in Lutsk and Chernihiv, further dimming prospects for peace.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy took to X to condemn Russia's actions. ""This is not a country seeking peace,"" he said. “Russia doesn't change its stripes.”The timing of the strike coincided with Trump’s remarks that it “might be better to let Ukraine and Russia fight for a while” before attempting further peace efforts.His comments mark a shift from earlier calls for a negotiated settlement and cast doubt on any immediate diplomatic breakthrough.Although two rounds of direct peace talks have taken place, negotiations remain stalled. Ukraine has proposed a 30-day ceasefire and a direct Zelenskyy-Putin meeting, but the Kremlin has rejected the offer, continuing to demand terms unacceptable to Kyiv.""The Kremlin continues efforts to falsely portray Russia as willing to engage in good-faith negotiations to end the war,"" the Institute for the Study of War of Moscow said ThursdayThe massive barrage by Russia destroyed residential buildings and critical infrastructure. Fires broke out in multiple Kyiv districts, leaving over 2,000 homes without power. “They were working under fire to help people,” said Ukraine’s Interior Ministry about the emergency responders killed in the capital.Furthermore, drone debris caused blackouts in Ternopil, Lviv, and Khmelnytskyi, while Russia’s defence ministry claimed it hit military targets, including arms depots and drone factories.Ukraine launched retaliatory drone strikes on Moscow and other regions, damaging industrial sites and injuring three people. Russian air defences intercepted 174 drones and three Neptune missiles, and reported sabotage of railway infrastructure in Belgorod.","Russia launched over 400 drones and 40 missiles across Ukraine overnight, killing at least six people and injuring around 80 others.

What began as a strong alliance between US President Donald Trump and world's richest man Elon Musk has now spiralled into a sharp public fallout. Taking the rift further, the Tesla CEO and former insider in Trump’s administration triggered talk of a political shake-up by asking his followers: “Is it time to create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle?”Based on the poll results, Musk floated the name “The America Party” on X, the platform he owns.The overwhelming response to the poll, led him to say: “The people have spoken. A new political party is needed in America to represent the 80% in the middle!” and added, “And exactly 80% of people agree. This is fate.”Later in the day, he also reposted a message outlining his ""vision to dismantle the establishment,"" while spotlighting arguments against the entrenched ""establishment duopoly.""The political rift became public earlier this week when Musk slammed one of Trump’s most touted legislative efforts, referred to by the president as his “big, beautiful bill”, calling it a “disgusting abomination.”The remark surprised Republican leaders and got a rare serious reaction from President Trump.“Elon and I had a great relationship. I don’t know if we will anymore,” Trump said from the Oval Office. He didn’t stop there. Taking direct aim at Musk’s businesses, the president said: “The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts.”Musk, in return, accused Trump of “ingratitude” and escalated the standoff by reposting claims, without evidence, suggesting Trump’s name appeared in government documents linked to Jeffrey Epstein While South Africa born businessman Musk’s talk of a new party has sparked a wave of enthusiasm online, he cannot run for president himself due to the constitutional requirement that the office be held only by natural-born US citizens.","Tesla CEO and former insider in Trump’s administration triggered talk of a political shake-up by asking his followers: “Is it time to create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle?” Musk floated the name “The America Party” on X, the platform he owns.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121687393,imgsize-921203,width-400,resizemode-4/121687393.jpg"

A contingent of men deported from the US to Djibouti, East Africa, are stranded in a converted shipping container alongside US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officers who were tasked with their supervision after a court halted their deportation flight to South Sudan.According to US government reports, both the eight deportees and 13 Ice staff have started experiencing health issues.Since late May, eight individuals from Latin America, Asia and South Sudan, along with Ice staff, have remained confined at a US naval facility. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) reported that Ice officers began experiencing symptoms ""within 72 hours of landing"" in Djibouti, with ongoing suspected bacterial upper respiratory infections, the Guardian reported.The administration's plan to deport eight detainees with alleged criminal convictions to South Sudan was blocked by judicial intervention in May, upholding their right to contest the deportation through legal channels.DHS and Ice senior official Mellissa Harper stated in court documents that the detainees occupy a shipping container previously used as a conference space. The Ice officers are experiencing accommodation constraints, with only six beds available for 13 personnel.Harper's declaration noted that local burn pits have caused respiratory issues among Ice officials. She highlighted the challenging conditions, including daytime temperatures exceeding 100F (38C), and malaria risks due to lack of preventive medication before arrival.""Within 72 hours of landing in Djibouti, the officers and detainees began to feel ill,"" Harper stated, noting inadequate diagnostic facilities.Harper further reported: ""Upon arrival in Djibouti, officers were warned by US Department of Defense officials of imminent danger of rocket attacks from terrorist groups in Yemen. The Ice officers lack body armor or other gear that would be appropriate in the case of an attack.""The declaration outlined restrictive conditions for detainees, including single daily showers and security checks during bathroom visits, located 40 yards from their container. Harper noted insufficient lighting creates security concerns for both officers and detainees.The administration had initially attempted to return the eight men to Myanmar, Cuba, Vietnam, Laos, Mexico and South Sudan. After these countries refused acceptance, authorities arranged their transfer to South Sudan in late May.Boston's US district judge Brian Murphy blocked this action, stating the administration had ""unquestionably"" violated his April ruling that guaranteed legal challenge rights for individuals facing third-country deportation.","Eight men deported from the US to Djibouti, East Africa, are stranded in a converted shipping container.

'It is exhausting': Trans military personnel decides whether to stay or leave







Transgender troops, who were serving the US military for many years, are now facing a difficult question: whether to stay or leave as the 30-day deadline ended on Friday.Last month, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth announced a 30-day deadline for the trans troops, and according to that, June 6 is the final day for active-duty transgender service members to request voluntary separation under the Pentagon's policy.Following this deadline, the Defense Department will begin compulsory dismissal of remaining personnel with gender dysphoria, a condition where one experiences psychological distress due to a mismatch between gender identity and birth-assigned sex.For many, it is a wrenching decision to end a career they love, and leave units they have led or worked with for years. And they are angry they are being forced out by the Trump administration’s renewed ban on transgender troops.Benjamin Kibler, a sailor, felt honoured upon being chosen for the prestigious Limited Duty Officer position, a role the US Navy reserves for their most qualified personnel.The February 24 news brought joy to Kibler and his spouse. They began preparations for their move to Japan, which included his wife's resignation, selling their vehicle, moving to a smaller flat and disposing of their possessions.Their plans unravelled within 48 hours.Kibler is one of many transgender and nonbinary service personnel impacted by the Defense Department's February 26 directive, stating that service members diagnosed with gender dysphoria would be removed from duty.""The contrast between Monday's commission offer and Wednesday's declaration of unfitness is perplexing,"" Kibler told CNN. He continued, ""My performance isn't the issue. That's particularly difficult to accept.""By early May, approximately 1,000 personnel had volunteered for separation, representing roughly a quarter of the 4,240 individuals identified with gender dysphoria as of December 2024, according to a senior defence official. The Army alone recorded about 700 voluntary separation requests this week, a Pentagon official informed CNN. Other branches' figures remain undisclosed.Another transgender service member, who plans to retire said, “They’re tired of the rollercoaster. They just want to go."" and added, ""it’s exhausting.”“I’m choosing to stay in and fight,” a noncommissioned officer in the Air Force said. “My service is based on merit, and I’ve earned that merit.”Military branches have begun identifying personnel with gender dysphoria diagnoses. An Army memo, obtained by CNN and initially reported by CBS, outlines additional identification criteria, including previous grooming standard exemption requests and visible conduct within units or on social media.","June 6 is the final day for active-duty transgender service members to request voluntary separation under the Pentagon's policy.

Win for Trump administration: US Supreme Court allows DOGE to access social security data; transparency obligations limited,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/win-for-trump-administration-us-supreme-court-allows-doge-to-access-social-security-data-transparency-obligations-limited/articleshow/121684707.cms,"The US Supreme Court in Washington (File photo)





The US Supreme Court delivered two rulings in favour of the Trump administration on Friday regarding Department of Government Efficiency cases, including permitting access to Social Security databases with personal details of millions of US citizens. The court also limited transparency requirements for DOGE, formerly headed by Elon Musk The court's conservative majority supported the administration in these first Supreme Court appeals concerning DOGE, while the three liberal justices opposed both decisions, reported the Associated Press.These DOGE rulings emerge during a contentious falling out between the president and Musk following his White House departure, involving threats to terminate government contracts and impeachment demands. Despite both individuals confirming DOGE's continuation, its future direction remains uncertain without Musk's leadership.In one ruling, the court suspended a Maryland judge's order limiting the team's Social Security Administration access under federal privacy regulations. ""We conclude that, under the present circumstances, SSA may proceed to afford members of the SSA DOGE Team access to the agency records in question in order for those members to do their work,"" stated the court's unsigned order.Conservative lower-court judges noted no current evidence of DOGE mishandling personal data.The agency maintains sensitive information about most Americans, including educational, financial and medical records.Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson warned that the ruling creates ""grave privacy risks"" for millions by granting ""unfettered data access to DOGE regardless- despite its failure to show any need or any interest in complying with existing privacy safeguards, and all before we know for sure whether federal law countenances such access."" Justice Sotomayor supported Jackson's position; Justice Kagan also opposed the administration's stance.The administration maintains DOGE requires access to fulfil its government waste reduction mission. Musk had prioritised Social Security, which he labelled a ""Ponzi scheme"", emphasising waste reduction as crucial for decreasing government expenditure.Maryland District Judge Ellen Hollander deemed DOGE's Social Security investigations a ""fishing expedition"" based on minimal fraud evidence, noting unrestricted access endangers Americans' privacy.Her decision permitted trained, vetted staff to access anonymous data, with broader access granted upon demonstrating specific requirements. The administration contends these limitations impede DOGE's effectiveness.Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued the ruling exemplifies judicial overreach into executive agency management. The plaintiffs maintain the order's narrow scope is essential for protecting personal information.An appeals court previously maintained the DOGE access restriction, though ideologically divided. Conservative minority judges noted no evidence of ""targeted snooping"" or personal data exposure.Labour unions and retirees, represented by Democracy Forward, initiated the lawsuit. It joins numerous legal challenges to DOGE's activities, including agency cuts and staff redundancies.The judicial system has become central to challenging President Trump's conservative agenda, facing approximately 200 lawsuits on policies ranging from immigration to federal worker dismissals.In Friday's other DOGE ruling, the justices extended a stay on orders requiring operational transparency, stemming from a government watchdog group's lawsuit.Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington argues DOGE's federal agency status requires Freedom of Information Act compliance.The administration maintains DOGE's advisory status exempts it from FOIA requirements.While not resolving this issue, the conservative majority determined District Judge Christopher Cooper's document disclosure order was overly broad.","The US Supreme Court delivered two rulings in favour of the Trump administration on Friday regarding Department of Government Efficiency cases.

Did you never think Epstein was killed, Rogan asks Kash Patel





FBI director Kash Patel came clean about the Epstein Files on a surprise Joe Rogan Experience episode that dropped a day after Elon Musk claimed that President Donald Trump is named in the Epstein Files and that's why they are not releasing it. The timing of the episode caught JRE fans by surprise as it was shot when Elon Musk and Donald trump were nuking each other. Kash Patel was seen smoking and talking in details about FBI and Epstein Files.Steering clear of Elon-Trump drama, Kash Patel said people are pissed at him for the delay in releasing the Epstein files. He said he was not there when Jeffrey Epstein did the abominable act with the protection of a section of media who chose to protect Epstein because of the connections he had.Claiming that Epstein killed himself, Patel asked if anyone thinks that he and Dan Bongino would protect any information regarding the pedophile. Patel said it was the decision of the Donald Trump administration that all files would be released and they will be released ""as much as possible"", Patel said.The FBI director added that he knows that he would not be able to convince anyone that Epstein did kill himself in the prison cell, no matter how many files the FBI releases, because there have been 15 years of people coming in and creating fiction.Joe Rogan asked Kash Patel what he used to think about Epstein's death before he became the FBI director. Patel said he never had a suspicion that Epstein was killed in his cell and said that he had a different background that made him acquainted with jails as a public defender. He said he knew people who committed suicides in cell and based on the information publicly available to him at that time, he always believed that it was not possible for anyone to enter Epstein's cell and kill him.Patel said the FBi would release the video of the cell and everybody would be able to see whether Epstein killed himself or not.When Joe Rogan presented several opinions of doctors who claimed that Epstein's death and his injuries looked more like a murder and not suicide, Kash Patel called it a 'war of experts'. He said this war of experts where there will always be someone to say something in contrary will go on for years, but his current job as the FBI director is to present the public with absolutely everything.","Kash Patel said he was not there when Jeffrey Epstein did the abominable act with the protection of a section of media who chose to protect Epstein.

Trump vs Musk: DOGE staff fear fallout; public feud sparks anxiety over political targeting- report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-vs-musk-doge-staff-fear-fallout-public-feud-sparks-anxiety-over-political-targeting-report/articleshow/121684666.cms,"



Following the public spat between US President Donald Trump and Elon Musk , staff members at the Musk-established Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) are reportedly experiencing increasing concerns about their professional future and potential targeting by the administrationCurrent DOGE personnel embedded within federal agencies are concerned that the public dispute between Trump and Musk might expose them to political consequences and affect their career opportunities, multiple sources with knowledge of internal discussions told ABC News.Personnel fear their DOGE connection could make them vulnerable if tensions escalate and Trump initiates an investigation into the government-reduction programme that Musk headed until his recent departure, the sources indicated. There are additional concerns that Trump's potential distancing from DOGE could negatively impact their professional standing.Musk, who leads Tesla and SpaceX, developed a close relationship with Trump during the past year while supporting his re-election campaign before establishing DOGE to support Trump's federal government reduction objectives. DOGE, as a quasi-governmental body, has sparked debates due to its agency closures and access to sensitive information.The relationship between the president and the world's wealthiest individual deteriorated into social media confrontation on Thursday, with Musk criticising Trump for ""ingratitude"" regarding the 2024 election, whilst Trump threatened to ""terminate Elon's governmental subsidies and contracts.""The public clash between Trump andMusk has intensified, following Musk's disapproval of a significant domestic policy initiative by Trump. The conflict between the two wealthy individuals heightened on Thursday as they traded harsh words on their respective social media platforms, indicating the end of their previous alliance.Trump initiated the exchange by expressing disappointment over Musk's criticism of his administration's primary tax and spending legislation, what he labelled as his 'one big, beautiful bill'.In response, Musk claimed credit for Trump's electoral success, stating: ""Without me, Trump would have lost the election"".The deterioration in their relationship occurred after Musk's sustained opposition to Trump's significant spending legislation, which received approval from the US House and awaits Senate consideration.Following his departure from the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) after 129 days of service, Musk utilised X to denounce the bill as a ""disgusting abomination"", adding: ""Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong.""Musk expressed concerns about the legislation's impact on US national debt levels and urged his followers to contact their representatives to voice opposition to the spending proposal.During this disagreement, War Room presenter and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, who has historically criticised Musk, urged the president to investigate the billionaire following Thursday's incident. ""This is a national security issue,"" Bannon stated on his programme Thursday. ""We're dealing with a very unstable individual out saying dangerous things about the president of the United States. He must be investigated . .. and all government contracts should be suspended.""Several key Musk associates who served as special government employees, including Steve Davis, the DOGE operational lead, left with Musk . However, numerous DOGE staff remain integrated across federal agencies, including the Office of Personnel Management, Veterans Affairs, Treasury, IRS, and Social Security Administration, the ABC News sources confirmed.Musk's exit represented a significant shift for DOGE's daily operations, as officials like Davis had managed DOGE activities across federal government for months.Following Musk's departure, DOGE staff will maintain their reporting structure to respective agency leadership, the sources indicated. The White House recently stated that ""DOGE leaders are each and every member of the president's cabinet and the president himself.""Sources further informed ABC News that some current DOGE federal government staff have begun seeking alternative employment. Despite concerns about future career prospects, several technology companies have shown interest in recruiting DOGE alumni, with Coinbase creating a specific hiring portal for former DOGE staff.Meanwhile, regarding potential DOGE investigations, a White House adviser indicated the president's focus remains on his signature spending legislation, the ""Big Beautiful Bill.""Despite the public disagreement, Trump has not publicly criticised DOGE and previously praised the initiative. During a recent Oval Office press event, Trump commended Musk's transformation of Washington's operational methods and described DOGE as a significant government reform programme.Upon leaving the Trump administration, Musk minimised DOGE's dependence on his leadership, stating, ""DOGE is a way of life, like Buddhism. You wouldn't ask the question, 'Who would lead Buddhism?'""",Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) staff are experiencing increasing concerns about their professional future and potential targeting by the administration.

"'What American justice looks like': Man mistakenly deported to El Salvador back to US; faces federal charges, says attorney general",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/man-mistakenly-deported-to-el-salvador-coming-back-to-us-kilmar-abrego-garcia-faces-federal-charges-on-return-report/articleshow/121684325.cms,"Kilmar Abrego Garcia (Photo: AP)





Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March, has returned to the United States to face federal criminal charges, attorney General Pam Bondi announced Friday.Following extensive diplomatic negotiations between El Salvador's government and the Trump administration, Bondi, in apress briefing said, ""Abrego Garcia has landed in the United States to face justice,"" adding ""this is what American justice looks like."" She further expressed gratitude to El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele for facilitating Abrego Garcia's return to US soil. ""Our government presented El Salvador with an arrest warrant and they agreed to return him to our country,"" Bondi said.However, she also added that after the trial in US, ""upon completion of his sentence, we anticipate he will be returned to his home country of El Salvador"".Meanwhile, the legal representative of Abrego Garcia, in a statement to ABC News, voiced his commitment to continue pursuing a fair trial for his client. ""From the beginning, this case has made one thing painfully clear: The government had the power to bring him back at any time.Instead, they chose to play games with the court and with a man's life,"" said attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg. ""We're not just fighting for Kilmar -- we're fighting to ensure due process rights are protected for everyone. Because tomorrow, this could be any one of us -- if we let power go unchecked, if we ignore our Constitution.""This development comes over two months following the Trump administration's acknowledgement that they erroneously deported him to El Salvador, his country of origin, from his residence in Maryland. The federal judiciary and Trump administration have been engaged in a prolonged dispute over court directives requiring the government to ""facilitate"" Abrego Garcia's return from El Salvador following his incorrect deportation in mid-March. One federal judge cautioned this situation could create an ""incipient crisis"" between the governmental branches.In the Middle District of Tennessee, Abrego Garcia faces two criminal charges: conspiracy to unlawfully transport illegal aliens for financial gain and the actual transportation of illegal aliens for financial gain.According to the indictment revealed on Friday afternoon, Abrego Garcia and his associates are accused of facilitating the entry of thousands of undocumented immigrants from various Central American nations into the US in recent years, ""many of whom were MS-13 members and associates.""The administration's approach and legal positions have consistently troubled judges across the political spectrum, who expressed concern about officials' apparent disregard for due process rights, particularly given their casual response to the deportation, which various administration solicitors termed an ""administrative error"" they could not address.Whilst Abrego Garcia's is confirmed by US media outlets, his long-term residence in the US remains uncertain. His deportation to a high-security prison in El Salvador violated a 2019 judicial order prohibiting his removal to his native country due to potential gang violence risks. However, this ruling did not prevent his removal to another nation.Abrego Garcia, who hails from El Salvador, entered the United States without documentation sometime around 2011. Immigration authorities apprehended him in Maryland in 2019. Subsequently, a judicial ruling permitted his continued stay in the country, citing safety concerns if he were to return to his homeland; still he was deported.His spouse, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, who holds US citizenship, has criticised both the Trump and Bukele governments, stating they are engaging in ""political games"" at the expense of her husband's wellbeing. Neither in the United States nor in El Salvador does García have any criminal history, and he has never faced accusations of gang-affiliated activities.The administration has previously indicated that upon his return to the US, they might consider deportation to a different country or attempt to nullify the 2019 order.US District Judge Paula Xinis has permitted an investigative process to determine the government's compliance with her instruction to return Abrego Garcia to the US. Recently, the case has received less public attention as this discovery process continues largely away from public scrutiny.","Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March, has returned to the U.S. to face federal criminal charges.

"California funding slashed? Trump administration plans federal grant cuts, escalate fight over policy disputes: Report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/california-funding-slashed-trump-administration-plans-federal-grant-cuts-escalate-fight-over-policy-disputes-report/articleshow/121682436.cms,"Donald Trump has criticised California Governor Gavin Newsom over various policies (File photos)





The US administration under Donald Trump is readying plans to withdraw substantial federal funding from California, with implementation potentially beginning Friday, according to various sources, quoted by CNN.Federal departments have reportedly received instructions to identify specific grants that could be withheld from California. A whistleblower informed a Congressional committee that all research grants to the state would be terminated, as reported by one source with knowledge of the situation.California, under Democratic leadership, has consistently been a focus of President Donald Trump's criticism.Last month, Trump had indicated possible withdrawal of federal funds from California regarding a transgender athlete's sports participation, demonstrating his pattern of using funding to achieve policy objectives. The administration reduced flood prevention funding by $126.4 million, and Trump has repeatedly criticised the state's wildfire management earlier this year. There has been ongoing public disagreement between the President and California Governor Gavin Newsom.The state's tertiary education sector faces significant impact from Trump's decision. California Representative Darrell Issa (GOP), while unaware of the impending grant cancellations, told CNN about recent meetings with university officials concerned about their funding stability.""Every university, every research organization, pretty much I saw them passing through here the last two days"" Issa said.In response to university representatives' concerns, Issa further told CNN, ""We're going to advocate for essentials, but I sent them back and said come to me with specifics. Come to me with the grant and the justification, and I'll advocate for that. But I'm not going to advocate for no cuts; you just get more money every year. That's how we got in this problem.""","US administration under Donald Trump is readying plans to withdraw substantial federal funding from California.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif has urged the US to broker a ""comprehensive dialogue"" between India and Pakistan. Addressing an event at the US embassy in Islamabad on Wednesday, Sharif lauded US President Donald Trump for what he said was his role in defusing a four-day military clash last month that was triggered by the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that claimed 26 lives. India has rejected all claims of a US role in bringing about a cessation of hostilities.Sharif's praise for Trump as a leader ""against escalation and war"" was mirrored by Pakistan Peoples Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari in Washington. Bilawal credited Trump's diplomacy for the ceasefire and suggested that US mediation could facilitate broader talks. ""If America can help sustain this ceasefire, its role in arranging a comprehensive dialogue would benefit both nations,"" he said. This appeal to Trump's deal-making persona has sparked suspicion in India, where analysts see it as Pakistan's attempt to shift focus from its alleged role in cross-border terrorism and regain diplomatic leverage.Sharif's call for dialogue signals willingness to engage but raises questions about Pakistan's commitment to India's concerns, especially after dismissing the Simla Agreement and seeking US involvement.","Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif has urged the US to broker a ""comprehensive dialogue"" between India and Pakistan.

"Over 200,000 Afghans forced to leave Pakistan amid intensified deportation drive; Iran ramps up expulsions too",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/over-200000-afghans-forced-to-leave-pakistan-amid-intensified-deportation-drive-iran-ramps-up-expulsions-too/articleshow/121626249.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: ANI)





More than 200,000 Afghans have left Pakistan since April as Islamabad ramped up its deportation campaign targeting undocumented migrants, with Iran also increasing expulsions, raising concerns over Afghanistan’s capacity to manage the influx.According to Pakistan’s ministry of interior, over 135,000 Afghans left the country in April, followed by 67,000 in May, and more than 3,000 in just the first two days of June. The repatriation drive, which began in November 2023, has now seen over one million Afghans return from Pakistan, reported news agency ANI, citing ARY News.The deportation campaign is aimed at more than 800,000 Afghans whose residency documents have been revoked. Among them are individuals born or raised in Pakistan. Islamabad has accused Afghan nationals of links to terrorism and blamed Kabul for harbouring militants, a charge the Taliban authorities have repeatedly denied.Farmer Mohammad Wali, who crossed into Afghanistan via the southern Spin Boldak border, was quoted by AFP as saying, “We left behind our orchards... but we said to ourselves, ‘If we stay, maybe one day we’ll lose our dignity.’”With Eid al-Adha approaching, the pace of returns has slightly slowed, though crossings continue daily.Iran, meanwhile, is pushing ahead with similar measures. The UN's International Organisation for Migration (IOM) recorded 15,675 Afghan deportations from Iran in May, more than double the figure in April.The IOM expressed alarm at the increasing number of families, rather than single men, being sent back, calling this “a new and concerning trend.”In late May, Iranian authorities ordered undocumented Afghans to leave by July 6—a move that could impact as many as four million people, according to AFP. Already, more than 450,000 Afghans have returned from Iran since January.Both nations host millions of Afghan refugees who fled decades of conflict.But as economic conditions worsen and political tensions rise, public support for Afghan migrants has diminished. Pakistan, which still hosts around three million Afghans, has also warned it may revoke the UNHCR-issued refugee cards of 1.3 million cardholders by the end of June.The IOM has repeatedly urged countries to “immediately suspend the forced return of Afghans... until safe, voluntary, and dignified return conditions are in place.”The Taliban authorities, who remain internationally unrecognised, have echoed the call, asking for returns to occur in a “dignified” manner.Analysts view the deportation moves, particularly by Pakistan, as politically driven. Islamabad is under pressure to address domestic security threats, especially in border regions plagued by insurgencies.However, rights groups and humanitarian agencies warn that Afghanistan’s already fragile infrastructure is ill-equipped to absorb such a massive and sudden return of people.","More than 200,000 Afghans have left Pakistan since April as Islamabad ramped up its deportation campaign targeting undocumented migrants.
