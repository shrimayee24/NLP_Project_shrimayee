Trump Greenlights Over 3,300 Cruise Missiles For Ukraine To BOMB Russia, But There’s A Catch

US President Donald Trump was ""not happy"" but ""not surprised"" by Russia’s latest missile and drone strikes on Kyiv that killed at least 19 people, the White House said on Thursday, while urging “both sides” to move toward ending the war.“He was not happy about this news, but he was also not surprised. These are two countries that have been at war for a very long time,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters during her daily briefing.Leavitt added, “Russia launched this attack on Kyiv, and likewise, Ukraine recently dealt a blow to Russia's oil refineries.”The Russian barrage hit residential apartment blocks, a European Union mission, and a British government cultural centre in one of the largest attacks since the war began in February 2022, reported AFP,Trump, who had pledged to end the Ukraine conflict “within 24 hours” of taking office, has since acknowledged the situation is more complex than anticipated. A summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this month in Alaska failed to yield any breakthrough.Leavitt said the president may issue further remarks on the Kyiv attack and reiterated Trump’s stance on seeking a negotiated end to the war.“Perhaps both sides of this war are not ready to end it themselves,” she said. “The president wants it to end, but the leaders of these two countries... must want it to end as well.”Leavitt also claimed Trump had worked “harder than anyone” to secure peace, echoing recent remarks from the administration pointing to diplomatic efforts as ongoing.Meanwhile, Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, warned that the latest strikes could set back the president’s peace efforts.“These egregious attacks threaten the peace that @POTUS is pursuing,” Kellogg posted.","US President Donald Trump was ""not happy"" but ""not surprised"" by Russia's latest missile and drone strikes on Kyiv that killed at least 19 people.

NEW DELHI: Author Arundhati Roy on Thursday said that ""almost all the people who we call ‘antinationals’ are the ones who care"" while those who project themselves as nationalists often work only to protect their own wealth.""Almost all the people who we call 'antinationals' are the ones who care. And then the people who call themselves great nationalists, I can bet you that 99 per cent of them are dodging taxes, have sent their kids to America, or are doing everything to make sure that what goes on in this country doesn't affect their personal wealth or their whatever bullshit,"" Roy was quoted as saying by the news agency PTI.She was speaking at the launch of her memoir. The book is centred on her relationship with her mother, Mary Roy, a women’s rights activist who fought the landmark inheritance case for Syrian Christian women in Kerala.Roy said she wrote the memoir after Mary’s death in 2022, describing it as ""born out of the onrush of memories and feelings provoked"" by her mother’s passing. ""I wrote this book because I feel that my mother is someone who deserves to be shared with the world,"" she said, as quoted by PTI.The 63-year-old, who won the Booker Prize in 1997 for, said her writing has always come from ""a place of love and caring about something"".""I write when it becomes harder to keep quiet than to write,"" Roy told PTI in an interview. She added, ""People don't understand why one gets so upset? Why do I write? Because it comes from a place of love. It comes from caring about something. Otherwise, why should I bother? Like, why shouldn't I enjoy my Booker Prize or whatever it was.""She said she does not see herself as both a writer and activist. ""It’s a label I find absurd, something like the clunky term sofa-bed,"" she remarked.Roy described writing itself as a risky pursuit. ""The most dangerous place in the history of time has been writing. I've never been under any illusion that it was a safe place. So I'm okay here. Because it's the safety that suffocates me,"" she said.The memoir details her difficult relationship with her mother, who, she recalls, insisted her children address her as “Mrs Roy” like other students at her school in Kerala. “It was almost as though for her (Mary) to shine her light on her students and give them all she had, we — he (the brother) and I (Roy) — had to absorb the darkness,” Roy writes.She added, “She was rough, and that roughness was what put some steel into my spine... So when all those people were around me — protesting and calling me names — I’d just be going like, 'Do you know whose daughter I am?' Like, my needle isn't moving at all.”Over the years, Arundhati Roy has faced cases, protests, and even a day in jail for supporting the Narmada Bachao Andolan. Her bookwas banned in Jammu and Kashmir this August along with 24 other titles for allegedly promoting ""false narrative and secessionism"".","Arundhati Roy says those who project themselves as nationalists often work only to protect their own wealth.

Some say Mayawati has compromised, some say Owaisi has compromised, and now people are saying even Congress has compromised. Recently, while I was talking to people in Goa, they were saying that five of our (AAP's) top leaders were jailed by the BJP.

Supreme Court raised the question - its refrain through the hearings on presidential reference over the court's decision to fix timelines for governors and the President to take calls on bills - again at the end of arguments from the Centre and NDA-led states canvassing wide discretionary powers for the state executive head.Leading the arguments on behalf of opposition-governed states that are diametrically opposite to those advanced by the Centre, senior advocate A M Singhvi, on behalf of Tamil Nadu, told the bench that a governor is merely an ornamental head of the state and bound by the aid and advice of the council of ministers headed by the chief minister on every option to be exercised by him with regard to a bill.A bench of Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, P S Narsimha and A S Chandurkar said, ""The Constituent Assembly deleted the six-week timeline for a governor to take a decision on a bill and replaced it with 'as soon as possible'. Does it not mean at the earliest and not later than six weeks? As the framers of the Constitution expected a governor to act expeditiously, can SC not examine if a governor indefinitely sits over a bill passed by assembly to frustrate law-making?""This question came from the bench when solicitor general Tushar Mehta argued that a state govt is precluded from invoking Article 32 to seek a writ against a governor, who as per the Constitution is not answerable to a court for the decisions he takes while holding the constitutional post.Singhvi said a governor has no discretionary power to negate a bill passed by an assembly. Making a governor's decisions non-justiciable would make him, not the will of the people through an assembly, the supreme law-making authority as he can scotch a validly passed bill null and void by simply consigning it to his cupboard and forgetting about it, he said.The bench said if a governor finds a bill to be repugnant to central law, he had the option of reserving it for the President's consideration.",Can a governor keep a bill passed by the assembly pending indefinitely to frustrate the will of the people exercised through the legislature?

""We don't decide... if we were the ones deciding, would it have taken so long?"" Bhagwat said, suggesting that the delay was because of the BJP leadership's inability to choose a replacement for incumbent J P Nadda.Bhagwat was speaking at a marathon two and a half hours long question-answer session on the conclusion of his two-day lecture organised as part of the Sangh's centenary celebrations.While he addressed dozens of questions on a range of issues, a packed Vigyan Bhawan keenly awaited his response to a clutch of questions related to his view on whether those of 75 years of age should quit their posts.Bhagwat explained that he had merely quoted the remark that Pingle, known for his ready wit, had made in zest when he was felicitated after reaching 75 years.","Bhagwat and PM Modi turn 75 this Sept 11 and 17, respectively.

‘How do you feel?’: Lindsey Graham again blames India over Russian oil trade as Kyiv reels from deadly strikes; says it is ‘experiencing cost of supporting Putin’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-do-you-feel-lindsey-graham-again-blames-india-over-russian-oil-trade-as-kyiv-reels-from-deadly-strikes-says-it-is-experiencing-cost-of-supporting-putin/articleshow/123573653.cms,"File photo: US Senator Lindsey Graham (Picture credit: AP)

US Senator Lindsey Graham on Thursday renewed his warning to countries purchasing Russian oil, directly naming India as facing consequences for what he called support to Moscow’s war machine.In a post on X, Graham wrote, “India, China, Brazil and others who prop up Putin 's war machine by buying cheap Russian oil: How do you feel right now that your purchases have resulted in innocent civilians, including children, being killed? India is experiencing the cost of supporting Putin. To the rest, you will soon, too.”His remarks came after a barrage of Russian missile strikes on Kyiv on Thursday that killed at least 23 people and injured dozens.According to Euro News, the attack also damaged the European Union’s diplomatic mission in the Ukrainian capital, sparking international condemnation. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described the strikes as “another massive attack against our cities and communities,” confirming that rescuers were pulling survivors from the rubble of a residential building.“At least 8 people have already been confirmed dead. One of them is a child.My condolences to all their families and loved ones,” he said in a post on X.As per news agency AFP, the strikes form part of one of the deadliest attacks on Kyiv in recent months, with authorities later raising the toll to 23 dead, including four children. EU and British diplomatic missions, as well as offices of media organisations, were also hit.Graham has repeatedly linked the continuation of the war in Ukraine to oil revenue from international buyers. Speaking earlier on NBC’s Meet the Press, the senator said US President Donald Trump was determined to end the conflict by targeting Russia’s oil customers. “Without oil and gas revenue, Russia collapses… the whole goal is to crush his customers – India, China, Brazil,” Graham said.His criticism coincides with mounting trade tensions between Washington and New Delhi. India has denounced new US tariffs of over 50 per cent on Indian goods as “unjustified and unreasonable.”The commerce ministry acknowledged the new tariffs will cause short-term pain in sectors such as textiles, chemicals and machinery, though it maintained that the long-term effect on overall trade and GDP would be limited. Industry bodies, it said, have already raised concerns about liquidity pressures as orders slow and payments are delayed.Graham has previously warned European allies as well, accusing some nations of indirectly buying Russian oil routed through India. In a post earlier this month, he cautioned, “We are watching. This needs to stop now.”",US Senator Lindsey Graham renewed his warning to countries purchasing Russian oil.

Tragically, five of her children passed away shortly after birth, leaving 11 surviving siblings. The family is currently grappling with severe financial difficulties and lacks stable housing.Medical practitioner at Jhadol Community Health Center, Roshan Darangi, said Kalbeliya initially informed them this was her fourth delivery. However, the hospital later learnt that she had already given birth to 16 children. The doctor said such a delivery could have been high-risk without knowing the patient's full medical history.However, the woman did not have any previous sonography reports or prenatal test results.The health department expressed grave concerns over the health risks associated with such high numbers of childbirths, especially given the family's socio-economic challenges. Dr Madhu Riteshwar, a senior health official, said, ""If a woman has given birth to her 17th child, it is a matter of concern. We will investigate the case to determine if our teams have ever reached the family to encourage family planning. We will also assess if other families in the area face similar situations.""The incident intensified the health department's focus on certain blocks in Udaipur, primarily tribal pockets, which are already under scrutiny for high total fertility rates (TFR). Despite ongoing efforts, officials are struggling to bring these numbers down, and this case underscores the urgency of their mission.Officials said the health department is committed to preventing maternal mortality and addressing high-risk cases such as Kalbeliya's. The investigation, they added, will seek to uncover the root causes of such high fertility rates and implement effective strategies to promote family planning and population stabilisation in the region.","55-year-old woman from Jhadol village in Udaipur district has given birth to her 17th child.

What are protesters demands

Two Microsoft employees were terminated on Wednesday, August 27, after their participation in a sit-in at the company president's office, a protest against the tech giant's business ties to Israel. The employees, Anna Hattle and Riki Fameli, were reportedly among seven protesters who occupied the office of Microsoft President Brad Smith on Tuesday. According to the activist group No Azure for Apartheid , Hattle and Fameli received voicemails informing them of their termination. A Microsoft spokesperson confirmed the dismissals, citing ""serious breaches of company policies and our code of conduct"" related to ""the break-in at the executive offices.""The other five protesters arrested during the sit-in were identified as former Microsoft workers or individuals unaffiliated with the company.“Two employees were terminated today following serious breaches of company policies and our code of conduct. The first violated the Business Conduct Policy, participated in the unlawful break-in at the executive offices, and other demonstrations on campus, and was arrested by authorities on our premises on two occasions. The second was involved in the break-in at the executive offices and was subsequently arrested. These incidents are inconsistent with the expectations we maintain for our employees. The company is continuing to investigate and is cooperating fully with law enforcement regarding these matters.”The protest group No Azure for Apartheid has demanded that Microsoft sever its ties with Israel and provide reparations to Palestinians. The group's name references Microsoft's Azure cloud software, which a joint media investigation by The Guardian, +972 Magazine, and Local Call reported is used by an Israeli military surveillance agency. The investigation claimed the agency utilized Azure to store recordings of phone calls made by Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza and for the broader surveillance of Palestinians.""We are here because Microsoft continues to provide Israel with the tools it needs to commit genocide while gaslighting and misdirecting its own workers about this reality,"" Hattle said in a statement.In response to the media investigation, Microsoft announced this month that it had hired the law firm Covington & Burling LLP to conduct a review.Two employees terminated in April due to similar protestsThe firings of Hattle and Fameli follow a similar incident in April when two other Microsoft employees were also terminated after a pro-Palestinian protest interrupted a company event. The latest firings highlight a growing trend of employee activism within the company and come amid widespread protests at corporations and universities over their connections to Israel.Microsoft President Brad Smith addressed the protests on Tuesday, stating, ""we respect the freedom of expression that everyone in this country enjoys as long as they do it lawfully.""","Two Microsoft employees were terminated on Wednesday, August 27, after their participation in a sit-in at the company president's office.

‘A part of staircase collapsed week before Virar building portion crash’

Vacate buildings issued notices: VVCMC official

VASAI: Seventeen people, including six women and three children, were killed and nine injured after the rear wing of a 13-year-old, five-storey unauthorised building collapsed in Virar (E) around Tuesday midnight- an indication of rampant illegal constructions over years in the Vasai-Virar belt. The victims included a one-year-old girl, whose birthday party had just ended.Ramabai Apartment in Vijay Nagar has around 50 flats and half a dozen shops. The rear side of the building, comprising around 12 flats, collapsed, trapping 25 people. The debris fell on one side of an 8-room chawl but none from the chawl was injured.The search and rescue operations, which started within hours, continued till Thursday afternoon.Additional commissioner of Vasai-Virar municipal corporation, Sanjay Herwade, who visited the spot said prima facie the construction material used was of an inferior quality and urged other residents who have received notices to vacate- a resident said the developer did not share any such notice. All affected families have been put up in a shelter. Officials said the residents, most of them blue collar workers, believed the building was legal as they were paying taxes.""Most of these deals were based on notarised documents,"" an official said.Police have booked the developer, Nittal Gopinath Sane (47), owner of Sai Dutta Builders and Developers, for culpable homicide and were questioning him till the time of going to press.Just around Tuesday midnight, the rear side of Ramabai Apartment, located in the C-Ward of Vasai-Virar City Municipal Corporation at Vijay Nagar, Virar East, collapsed. The debris also fell on one side of an 8-room chawl built near its base but no one from the chawl was injured.The chawl along with another three-storey building was evacuated as only a lane separated these two from the collapsed Ramabai Apartment.Police have booked the builder, Nittal Gopinath Sane (47), owner of Sai Dutta Builders and Developers, under provisions of the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning (MRTP) Act, 1966, and BNS Section 105 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder).The office of chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has announced Rs 5 lakh as compensation for the families of those who died. Fadnavis said Virar has a history of issues of illegal, old and dilapidated buildings and poor infrastructure. “We have started taking action as can be seen from the recent Enforcement Directorate (ED) raids. We are addressing these issues,” he said.After 41 illegal buildings were demolished in Vasai based on the orders of the court, earlier this month, ED had arrested VVCMC commissioner Anil Pawar, an IAS officer, among others, who ED claimed was part of an alleged cartel of civic officers, architects, chartered accountants and intermediaries, which set in motion the large-scale illegal constructions in the region.A social worker alleged that last week a portion of a staircase had collapsed and he had informed the developer the building might collapse but this was ignored. He also claimed this building had till now received three notices but the developer ignored those too.The locals were the first to reach the spot and begin the rescue work. They were later joined by the fire brigade, NDRF and the police. The rescue operation was called off around 2pm Thursday after the last body was pulled out. VVCMC has decided to demolish the remaining portion of the building to avoid any damage to adjacent buildings.The rescue operation was hampered since there was no proper access to bring in heavy machinery. It was only post afternoon Wednesday that the chawl was razed to make way for the machinery. Occupants of the adjoining three-storey building were also evacuated as the use of machinery could hamper its stability.One resident said the developer did not share notices from VVCMC.He said they were trying for redevelopment and even hired a lawyer but the landowner and the developer did not cooperate. Tukaram Shinde, a resident, said the developer did receive notices from VVCMC regarding its dilapidated status.While announcing the completion of the search and rescue operation in the Virar building collapse, VVCMC additional commissioner Sanjay Herwade said prima facie the construction material used was poor and appealed to residents of other dilapidated buildings who have received notices to vacate them and not take any risk.Meanwhile, Anil Chavan, deputy district president (Palghar) of Shiv Sena and a lawyer, said he will write to both the VVCMC commissioner and the MBVV police commissioner to file cases under stringent sections against erring developers so that their properties can be seized and the proceeds distributed among cheated buyers.","The rear wing of a 13-year-old, five-storey unauthorised building collapsed in Virar (E) around Tuesday midnight- an indication of rampant illegal constructions over years in the Vasai-Virar belt. The rear side of the building, comprising around 12 flats, collapsed, trapping 25 people. Police have booked the developer, Nittal Gopinath Sane (47), for culpable homicide.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123576175,imgsize-183002,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/-.jpg"

Family of Jim Irsay responds after new report on relapse and overdoses

“We continue to grieve the loss of our Dad, a man defined not only by his role as owner of the Colts, but also by his resilience, his personal struggles, and his deep love for family, friends, and community. Throughout his life, our Dad was open about his battles with addiction and mental health.

He never claimed to be perfect. Instead, he used his voice to reduce stigma and advocate for those facing similar challenges, with honesty, vulnerability, and compassion.

“We understand the public interest in his life and legacy. While we respect the role of responsible journalism, we decline to comment on the allegations in your inquiry. The media is not the place to address inquiries about information which is disputed, lacks essential context, or involves private medical matters.

Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay, who passed away on May 21, 2025, at the age of 65, had been struggling in secret with a relapse in the final years of his life, according to a new investigation by The Washington Post.

He was found dead in a luxury hotel in Beverly Hills, California, where he often stayed.The Washington Post investigation, published on August 28, 2025, shared accounts from five people with direct knowledge of Jim Irsay’s relapse. They said they saw him taking opioid pills, and four of them said they personally witnessed him receive ketamine injections.The report explained that Irsay’s health issues had long been presented as something else publicly, including statements from the Colts organization, but in reality, he had suffered several overdoses in the past few years.The Post found evidence of three overdoses before his death: once in Turks and Caicos in 2020, when he had to be flown by air ambulance for treatment; another in December 2023 at his Carmel, Indiana home, where police listed the case as an overdose; and a third 12 days later in Florida, when he was rushed to a hospital from a resort near Miami.After that Florida incident, Irsay was flown to Ascension St. Vincent Hospital in Indianapolis, where he spent nearly four months recovering. Even after this, he continued to receive prescriptions from Dr. Harry Haroutunian, an addiction specialist based in California.

The former WWE chairman and CEO, Vince McMahon, has been in the news for all the wrong reasons. In recent times, McMahon’s character has received some serious allegations and has come under heavy examination as a result of serious charges made by former WWE partner Janel Grant.He has been pressed with serious charges related to sexual assault, sex trafficking, sexual misconduct, and emotional abuse. These severe allegations have tarnished McMahon’s image in the industry, and the WWE mogul is going through rigorous investigation proceedings.Recently, former WWE writer Dan St. Germain has made some shocking claims and alleged that Vince McMahon was engaged in sexual misconduct with the late women’s wrestler Ashley Massaro on a flight. He even called McMahon a “maniac” for his unruly behaviour and disgusting character.Former WWE writer Dan St. Germain made shocking claims, accusing former WWE chairman Vince McMahon of engaging in public sexual acts with Massaro during a European tour. He opened up about the recent incident during an appearance on the Bein’ Ian podcast.According to St. Germain, McMahon initiated sexual behavior with Massaro on the plane. He recalled that once they landed, he allegedly ordered the entire WWE crew onto the tarmac, where they watched the plane rock back and forth while the act continued inside.Speaking about the incident, Dan St. Germain said, “Vince f***** a girl in front of everyone. They were on a European trip, and Vince started finger*** Ashley Massaro. And then Vince goes when they got on the tarmac, ‘Alright, everyone, get on the tarmac.’ They all went on the tarmac and watched as the f****** plane bounced back and forth, and Vince just f****** this girl in front of them. He’s an absolute maniac. This is true. So anyway, a lot of crazy stuff about that place.” Ashley Massaro was previously embroiled in a scandal during her stint with the WWE. In an affidavit that surfaced after she died in 2019, Massaro claimed that WWE assisted in concealing a 2007 sexual assault she had while on a WWE tour at a military installation. Now, with Germain’s allegations, it speaks about how difficult it must have been for Massaro during her time in WWE.These new details will raise more questions about WWE’s culture and McMahon’s character and unchecked behavior behind the scenes.Amidst investigation and court cases, Vince McMahon was recently spotted celebrating his 80th birthday with a lavish celebration in New York City, drawing WWE legends including John Cena, The Undertaker, Kane, and Shane McMahon. The private gathering at the Baccarat Hotel and Gotham Hall featured strict media control, with a professional photographer handling official images.However, Triple H, Stephanie McMahon, and Nick Khan were absent as they reportedly are overseas for a WWE tour.

Florida on Thursday executed Curtis Windom, a 59-year-old inmate convicted of killing his girlfriend, her mother and a man he claimed owed him $2,000.He was sentenced to death for a violent spree on November 7, 1992, in the Orlando area.Windom was pronounced dead at 6:17 pm after receiving a three-drug lethal injection at Florida State Prison near Starke, officials said. This marked a record 11th execution this year by the state of Florida.According to court records, Windom became enraged after learning that Johnnie Lee, who he said owed him $2,000, had won just $114 at a greyhound racetrack. Telling a friend that “you’re gonna read about me,” he bought a .38-caliber revolver and ammunition from a Walmart. He tracked down Lee, shooting him twice in the back from his car before firing twice more at close range. He then drove to his girlfriend Valerie Davis’ apartment, fatally shooting her “without provocation” in front of a witness. Windom also wounded another man before encountering Davis’ mother, Mary Lubin, who was rushing to check on her daughter. Lubin was shot dead in her car at a stop sign.Windom received three death sentences for the murders and a 22-year sentence for attempted murder.Davis was the mother of his daughter, Curtisia Windom, who this week joined an anti-death penalty group in urging Governor Ron DeSantis to halt the execution. “Forgiveness comes with time, and 33 years is a long time. I, myself, have forgiven my father,” she said, as activists submitted more than 5,000 petition signatures to the governor’s office.His lawyers pursued multiple appeals over the years, arguing he had been represented at trial by an incompetent lawyer who failed to investigate mental health issues. The Florida Supreme Court dismissed the claims, ruling prosecutors would have countered with damaging evidence, including allegations that Windom was a drug dealer and that Davis and Lubin were police informants.The US Supreme Court rejected his final appeal on Wednesday, clearing the way for DeSantis, who had signed his death warrant on July 29, to proceed.Windom became the 30th person executed in the United States in 2025, with Florida leading the tally after a flurry of death warrants signed by DeSantis. The state’s previous annual record was eight executions in 2014.A 12th execution is already scheduled for September 17, when David Joseph Pittman, 63, convicted of killing three members of his estranged wife’s family in Polk County in 1990, is set to die.","Curtis Windom, 59, was sentenced to death for killing his girlfriend, her mother and a man he claimed owed him $2,000.

Federal prosecutors have reduced charges against a man who threw a sandwich at a federal officer in Washington, after a grand jury refused to indict him on a felony assault count.Sean Charles Dunn, 37, a former justice department paralegal, went viral earlier this month after being filmed hurling a footlong submarine sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection officer near 14th and U streets.The video showed him shouting “fascists” and telling officers, “I don’t want you in my city!” before tossing the sandwich at one of them.Prosecutors initially pursued felony assault, which carries up to eight years in prison. However, grand jurors declined to return an indictment this week, prompting the US attorney’s office to refile the case as a misdemeanour charge of simple assault, punishable by up to one year behind bars, reported The New York Times.The failure to indict was striking given the near-automatic nature of the grand jury process. A well-known legal adage says prosecutors could “indict a ham sandwich.” Yet, in recent weeks, Washington jurors have rejected multiple felony cases linked to US President Donald Trump’s deployment of federal agents and National Guard troops in the capital.According to news agency AP, the Trump administration had spotlighted Dunn’s arrest, releasing a heavily produced video of armed officers arriving at his flat.Washington’s top prosecutor, Jeanine Pirro, also promoted the felony charge in a social media clip, quipping: “So there, stick your subway sandwich somewhere else.”Dunn, swiftly dismissed from his justice department role by attorney general Pam Bondi, has since been labelled “Sandwich Guy” by sections of the media and embraced by supporters as a symbol of pushback against Trump’s federal policing surge.As per AP, prosecutors faced another setback earlier this week when three separate grand juries refused to indict a woman accused of assaulting an FBI agent during an immigration protest. Her case, too, was downgraded to a misdemeanour.Judges have also expressed scepticism about some of these prosecutions. Magistrate Judge Zia M. Faruqui, in a separate case involving lawyer Paul Bryant, criticised prosecutors for detaining him, saying their request had “close to zero” chance of success.","Sean Charles Dunn, 37, was filmed hurling a footlong submarine sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection officer in Washington.

Two firefighters working to contain a wildfire in Washington state’s Olympic Peninsula were detained by US Border Patrol agents during an immigration enforcement operation, prompting widespread criticism from lawmakers and state officials.According to news agency Associated Press, the workers were part of a 44-person contract crew assigned to the Bear Gulch Fire when federal agents carried out identity checks on Wednesday.Authorities said two men were found to be in the United States illegally, with one facing a prior removal order.Both were taken into custody on charges of illegal entry and re-entry. The Bureau of Land Management subsequently terminated contracts with two Oregon-based firms, Table Rock Forestry and ASI Arden Solutions, and escorted the remaining 42 workers off federal land.The operation unfolded while crews were tackling the Bear Gulch Fire, which has burned about 14 square miles of forest and was 13 per cent contained by Thursday afternoon.Witnesses cited by the Seattle Times said that the firefighters were lined up and ordered to show identification, and were barred from saying goodbye to their detained colleagues. One firefighter was quoted as saying, “You risked your life out here to save the community.This is how they treat us.”The detentions provoked sharp responses from Washington Senator Patty Murray, who branded the Trump administration’s approach to immigration “fundamentally sick.”As per The Guardian, she said: “Here in the Pacific Northwest, wildfires can, and have, burned entire towns to the ground. This new Republican policy to detain firefighters on the job is as immoral as it is dangerous.”Washington Governor Bob Ferguson also said he was “deeply concerned” and has demanded further information from federal agencies. Commissioner of Public Lands Dave Upthegrove added that the actions had stoked fear and mistrust at a time when firefighters were risking their lives.As per news agency AFP, agents held the crews for several hours and prohibited them from filming the encounter. US Customs and Border Protection later defended the move, saying it was carried out at the request of land management officials and highlighted interagency coordination.As per AP, chief patrol agent Rosario Vasquez stated, “US Border Patrol steadfastly enforces the laws of the United States and unapologetically addresses violations of immigration law wherever they are encountered.”Lawyers with Innovation Law Lab, representing one of the detained men, alleged he was unlawfully held and denied access to counsel. “We demand that they allow him to access counsel as is his right afforded by the US Constitution,” lawyer Rodrigo Fernandez-Ortega was quoted as saying by AP.The US Forest Service confirmed it was aware of the Border Patrol’s activity but stressed that firefighting progress at Bear Gulch was not disrupted.","Two firefighters working to contain a wildfire in Washington state were detained by US Border Patrol agents during an immigration enforcement operation.

USA Today

US Vice President JD Vance has pushed back against swirling speculation over President Donald Trump’s health, insisting that the 79-year-old leader remains in “incredible” condition and full of energy.“The president is in incredibly good health,” Vance toldon Wednesday. “He’s got incredible energy. I feel very confident he is in good shape, will serve out the remainder of his term and do great things for the American people.”The remarks came amid a social media buzz triggered by viral clips showing a lighter cosmetic patch on Trump’s hand during his recent public appearances, including a visit to the People’s House museum in Washington DC and a FIFA World Cup event.Online remarks suggested possible health concerns, but the White House brushed off the speculation. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt highlighted Trump’s packed schedule of public engagements, stressing that he continues to actively interact with Americans, without directly addressing Donald Trump's hand patch condition.Donald Trump is the oldest person ever sworn in as US president, was 78 when he began his second term in January 2025.JD Vance, at 41, is the third-youngest vice president in US history.When asked if he was prepared to assume the presidency should circumstances demand, Vance said he was ready but reiterated confidence in Trump’s ability to serve.“Yes, terrible tragedies happen,” he said. “But I can’t think of better on-the-job training than what I’ve had in the past 200 days. That said, I believe the president is strong, focused and leading from the front.”Vance also pointed to Trump’s demanding work routine, noting that despite being older than most of his staff, the president is “the last to go to bed, the last making calls at night, and the first up in the morning setting the day’s agenda.”","JD Vance, 41, is the third-youngest vice president in US history.

Blue States vs Donald Trump: 19 Democratic Governors unite against National Guard threat; slam ‘abuse of power’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/blue-states-vs-donald-trump-19-democratic-governors-unite-against-national-guard-threat-slam-abuse-of-power/articleshow/123574074.cms,"File photo: US President Donald Trump (Picture credit: AP)

Nineteen Democratic governors on Thursday issued a rare joint statement denouncing US President Donald Trump’s threat to deploy National Guard troops in major US cities without their consent, describing the move as an “alarming abuse of power. ”The statement, signed by Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, Maryland’s Wes Moore, New York’s Kathy Hochul and nearly every other Democratic governor except those in Arizona, Connecticut, Hawaii and Minnesota, directly challenged Trump’s claim that he could override state authority.“Instead of actually addressing crime, President Trump cut federal funding for law enforcement that states rely on and continues to politicise our military by trying to undermine the executive authority of governors as commanders in chief of their state’s National Guard,” they wrote, according to the New York Times.They added, “Whether it’s Illinois, Maryland and New York or another state tomorrow, the president’s threats and efforts to deploy a state’s National Guard without the request and consent of that state’s governor is an alarming abuse of power, ineffective, and undermines the mission of our service members. This chaotic federal interference in our states’ National Guard must come to an end.”Trump escalated tensions earlier in the week by claiming he had “the right to do anything I want to do” with the Guard, sparking fears among Democratic-led states.In recent months, his administration has already sent troops to Washington, DC, and Los Angeles. As per news agency AP, the department of homeland security also approached Naval Station Great Lakes, north of Chicago, for logistical support in immigration operations, suggesting the city could be next.Local leaders in Chicago said they were not consulted. Mayor Brandon Johnson and Governor Pritzker have vowed to resist, with city officials preparing for potential legal action. Police Superintendent Larry Snelling urged clearer communication to avoid panic, saying, “We don’t want to create chaos on our streets.”The pushback from Democratic governors comes amid rising concerns about militarisation in domestic affairs. Former President Barack Obama warned on X that the erosion of due process and the use of troops on American soil “puts the liberties of all Americans at risk.”Pete Buttigieg, now US transportation secretary, also criticised the idea, noting that Naval Station Great Lakes was never meant for surveillance or enforcement against citizens.Trump, however, has defended his approach, insisting Democratic leaders have failed to control crime. On his Truth Social platform, he wrote, “The people are desperate for me to Stop the crime, something the Democrats aren’t capable of doing.”Despite Trump’s repeated characterisation of Chicago as a “war zone”, city data shows violent crime has fallen sharply. According to AP, in the first half of 2025, total violent crime dropped by more than 22 per cent compared with the same period in 2024. Still, with 573 homicides last year, Chicago recorded more killings than any other US city.Governor Pritzker has argued there is no emergency justifying military intervention, accusing Trump of pursuing a political agenda ahead of the 2026 elections. “This is a part of his plan to do something really nefarious, which is to interfere with elections,” Pritzker was quoted as saying by AP.","US President Donald Trump has threatened to deploy National Guard troops in major US cities without their consent. 19 Democratic governors on Thursday issued a rare joint statement denouncing the move as an “alarming abuse of power” The statement was signed by Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, Maryland’s Wes Moore, New York’S Kathy Hochul and nearly every other Democratic governor.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123574124,imgsize-956271,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-85.jpg"

Washington Post

Jim O’Neill, deputy secretary of Health and Human Services, has been appointed acting director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), thereported.His appointment follows a leadership crisis at the agency after President Donald Trump removed CDC Director Susan Monarez last week.O’Neill, a biotech investor with close ties to Trump ally Peter Thiel, has been working alongside Kennedy since November to implement the administration’s “Make America Healthy Again” agenda.The White House in a statement said Susan Monarez dismissal was due to her being “not aligned with the president’s agenda.” Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt added, “If people are not aligned with the President’s vision and the Secretary’s vision to make this country healthy again, then we will gladly show them the door.”The ousting triggered chaos inside the CDC, with dozens of staff staging a walkout at the agency’s Atlanta headquarters on Thursday and at least three senior leaders resigning. Among them was Chief Medical Officer Debra Houry, who warned in a letter about the “rise of misinformation” on vaccines and raised concern over looming budget cuts under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.His appointment is seen as paving the way for Kennedy to assert greater influence over the CDC, as health experts warn that the turmoil could undermine trust in one of the world’s leading public health institutions.","Jim O’Neill, deputy secretary of Health and Human Services, has been appointed acting director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Susan Monarez has resigned as director of the US centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) just weeks after formally assuming the role, The New York Times reported, citing sources familiar with the matter.Monarez, an infectious disease researcher and the first non-physician to lead the agency in over 50 years, reportedly stepped down following disagreements with health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr, particularly over changes to the CDC's vaccine advisory panel.According to individuals who spoke to the portal on the condition of anonymity, Monarez had clashed with Kennedy over his decision to remove and replace members of the influential immunization policy committee with individuals critical of existing vaccine guidelines.Her short tenure coincided with significant restructuring at the CDC, including workforce reductions, budget cuts, and the elimination of some core agency functions. She had previously served as acting director since President Donald Trump took office and was confirmed after the president withdrew his earlier nominee, Dr. David Weldon.Dr. Monarez was reportedly required to coordinate policy decisions with both Matt Buckham, chief of staff at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and Matt Buzelli, chief of staff at the CDC.Last week, HHS appointed a vocal critic of COVID-19 vaccines to lead a subcommittee on vaccine safety, sparking concern among public health professionals. Meanwhile, CDC employees issued an open letter urging Kennedy to stop promoting what they called ""inaccurate information"" about vaccines.Monarez appeared to support their concerns, expressing worry about misinformation in an internal note, though without directly naming Kennedy.She had also received praise from CDC staff for her empathetic leadership following a recent shooting at the CDC’s Atlanta headquarters, in which a gunman—believed to be motivated by anti-vaccine beliefs—killed a police officer and fired on the building.As of now, no official comment has been provided by the department of health and human services.","Susan Monarez, an infectious disease researcher and the first non-physician to lead the agency in over 50 years, reportedly stepped down following disagreements with health secretary Robert F.

Cracker Barrel logo row: Chain restores ‘Old Timer’ after backlash; White House mocks with spoofed image featuring Donald Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/cracker-barrel-logo-row-chain-restores-old-timer-after-backlash-white-house-mocks-with-spoofed-image-featuring-donald-trump/articleshow/123535436.cms,"Cracker Barrel logo

US restaurant chain Cracker Barrel announced Tuesday it will restore its original logo after a week-long backlash from customers and political leaders, including President Donald Trump, who criticised its recent rebrand.The Lebanon, Tennessee-based chain confirmed in a statement on its website that it would keep its traditional emblem featuring an elderly man in overalls, known as “Uncle Herschel,” sitting next to a barrel alongside the words “Old Country Store.” “We thank our guests for sharing your voices and love for Cracker Barrel. Our new logo is going away and our ‘Old Timer’ will remain,” the company said.The controversy began last week when Cracker Barrel introduced a simplified text-only design as part of an effort to modernise its 660 restaurants across 43 states and appeal to younger customers.However, the shift sparked a culture war backlash online, with critics branding the move “woke.”The company’s shares, which had slumped after the rebrand, rebounded following the announcementOn Monday, Cracker Barrel issued an apologetic statement saying it “could have done a better job sharing who we are and who we’ll always be.” By Tuesday morning, Trump weighed in on Truth Social, urging the chain to revert to its old design, describing customer feedback as “the ultimate Poll.”Hours later, the company confirmed the reversal.Trump celebrated the decision, writing: “Congratulations ‘Cracker Barrel’ on changing your logo back to what it was. All of your fans very much appreciate it. Good luck into the future. Make lots of money and, most importantly, make your customers happy again!”As per ABC News, Cracker Barrel stressed it would continue honouring its long-standing traditions, including the porch rocking chairs and menu favourites tied to Uncle Herschel’s legacy. “At Cracker Barrel, it’s always been – and always will be – about serving up delicious food, warm welcomes, and the kind of country hospitality that feels like family,” the company said.The White House also joined the mockery by sharing a spoofed logo on X with a caption “Go woke, go broke”. The image shared featured Trump in place of Uncle Herschel with the words “America First” and the slogan “AMERICA IS BACK.”Despite CEO Julie Masino’s earlier defence of modernisation, Cracker Barrel’s climbdown reflects the strength of its loyal customer base. The chain said its 70,000 employees now look forward to “welcoming you to our table soon.”","US restaurant chain Cracker Barrel announced Tuesday it will restore its original logo after a week-long backlash.

Russia surveillance drones fly over US weapons routes?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/russia-surveillance-drones-fly-over-us-weapons-routes/articleshow/123574827.cms,".

Russia or its proxies are flying surveillance drones over routes that the US and its allies use to ferry military supplies through eastern Germany, collecting intelligence that could be used to bolster the Kremlin's sabotage campaign and assist its troops in Ukraine, according to US and other Western officials. US and German officials have been discussing Russian sabotage efforts, including information that led to the arrest of three Ukrainian men accused in a Russia-linked plot, the officials said.The Russian sabotage campaign has led to fires at warehouses in Britain, an attack against a dam in Norway, attempts to cut cables under the Baltic Sea and an array of operations intended to bring the war in Ukraine closer to the heart of Europe and to undermine support for Kyiv.After hitting a high last year, Russian sabotage acts have fallen off significantly this year, experts and Western intelligence officials said. That is at least partly the result of heightened security in Europe, and efforts by US and European intelligence services to prevent attacks.The drop also likely reflects a swirl of diplomatic activity to negotiate an end to the fighting in Ukraine. ""The landscape is more difficult for Russians to operate,"" said Seth Jones, who studies the issue for the Center for Strategic and International Studies.""But it's not unreasonable to assume the Russians are a bit more cautious now while there are negotiations.""Jones noted in a report that Russian attacks in Europe quadrupled between 2022 and 2023, then tripled again between 2023 and 2024. But he tracked a significant drop-off in the first six months of this year, with only four incidents qualifying as sabotage or attempted sabotage by Russia.US spy agencies have been providing information to European govts about potential sabotage actions, according to people briefed on the discussions. US officials confirmed the flights but said they were unable to track their origin. They believe the drones have been flown by Russians or people working for Russian intelligence services.Asked about the report by journalists, Russian spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that ""it's hard to imagine, because then the Germans would have seen it clearly, and they would hardly have kept quiet. So, of course, all this looks more like another newspaper fake.""","Russia or its proxies are flying surveillance drones over routes that the US and its allies use to ferry military supplies through eastern Germany.

The White House said late Wednesday that it had fired Susan Monarez, the new director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, after a tense confrontation in which health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. tried to remove her from her position. A lawyer for Monarez said in response that she was refusing to step down.Monarez, an infectious disease researcher, was sworn in just a month ago by Kennedy, but had clashed with the secretary over vaccine policy, people familiar with the events said. Four other high-profile CDC officials quit en masse, apparently in frustration over vaccine policy and Kennedy's leadership.Because Monarez has been confirmed by the Senate - previous CDC directors were not subject to such confirmation - she serves at the pleasure of the president, and Kennedy likely did not have the authority to dismiss her.A spokesperson for President Donald Trump, Kush Desai, said in an email that Monarez was ""not aligned with the president's agenda of Making America Healthy Again,"" and so ""the White House has terminated Monarez from her position with the CDC.""Shortly past midnight, one of Monarez's lawyers, Mark S Zaid, rejected the firing as ""legally deficient"" because the president did not announce it. Desai did not respond to an email message asking if Trump would do so.Her lawyers had asserted earlier Wednesday that Monarez's situation was symbolic of larger issues. ""It is about the systematic dismantling of public health institutions, the silencing of experts, and the dangerous politicization of science,"" they wrote.The clash between Kennedy and Monarez, which had been brewing for days, burst into public view Wednesday. That afternoon, the department announced that Monarez was ""no longer"" director of the CDC. NYT","Susan Monarez, the new director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has been fired.

‘Poison in mind’: Trump’s crackdown on gender identity; says revise curriculum or face grant cuts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/poison-in-mind-trumps-crackdown-on-gender-identity-says-revise-curriculum-or-face-grant-cuts/articleshow/123572830.cms,"Donald Trump threatens funding cuts to states

The Trump administration among the 40 states has directed the Alabama department of public health (ADPH) to revise its teen sex education curriculum funded under the federal personal responsibility education program (PREP), citing the inclusion of “gender ideology” as outside the scope of the law, within 60 days.In a letter sent to the state, federal officials said Alabama’s current use of PREP funds - totaling $1.8 million annually - must exclude content related to gender identity and pronoun usage, which they say were improperly approved by the previous administration.“The statute neither requires, supports nor authorizes teaching students that gender identity is distinct from biological sex or that boys can identify as girls and vice versa,” the letter said, according to reporting by AL.com.“Thus, gender ideology is outside the scope of the authorizing statute and any expenditures associated with gender ideology are not allowable, reasonable, or allocable to the PREP grant.”Acting assistant secretary Andrew Gradison of administration for children and families, part of the US department of health and human services, in his letters to states said,“Accountability is coming,” Gradison said in a press release.“Federal funds will not be used to poison the minds of the next generation or advance dangerous ideological agendas.“The Trump Administration will ensure that PREP reflects the intent of Congress, not the priorities of the left.”PREP grants are intended to educate adolescents on topics like abstinence, contraception, and the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases. However, current Alabama curriculum materials also include language encouraging educators to ask participants for their pronouns as a way to create “a safe space for transgender or gender nonconforming youth.”“Model what you want participants to say by giving your own pronouns,” the curriculum says.“Some transgender youth might have typical pronouns (he/she/his/her/their) or they might request more creative pronouns such as hir or zir.”It adds, “The simple act of requesting pronouns sends the message that transgender and gender nonconforming youth are welcome and respected in the group.”The federal letter acknowledged that such language had previously been approved but said the “prior administration erred in allowing PREP grants to be used to teach students gender ideology.”It continued, “that approval exceeded the agency’s authority to administer the program consistent with the authorizing legislation as enacted by Congress.”As a result, “Alabama’s current PREP curricula and program materials are out of compliance with the PREP statute and HHS regulations and must be modified,” the letter said.State Senator Chris Elliott, a Republican from Baldwin County, confirmed that the matter was raised in a recent meeting in Washington with Trump administration officials.“They expressed concern about the Alabama department of public health's use of PREP funds,” Elliott told AL.com, noting that the concerns were part of a broader discussion around diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts and the creation of the Alabama office of minority affairs.",Alabama is one of 40 states that receive funds from the federal personal responsibility education program (PREP) Federal officials say Alabama’s current use of PREP funds - totaling $1.8 million annually - must exclude content related to gender identity and pronoun usage.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123572847,imgsize-814322,width-400,resizemode-4/donald-trump-threatens-funding-cuts-to-states.jpg"

US health and human services secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr has announced that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is launching formal studies into whether psychiatric medications - particularly SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) - and other drugs associated with gender transition could be linked to violent behavior, reported News3.The announcement came during an interview on Fox News following a tragic school shooting in Minnesota this week, where a 23-year-old shooter identified as transgender and left behind a manifesto describing years of depression and suicidal ideation.“We are doing those kinds of studies now,” Kennedy told host Brian Kilmeade. “At NIH we're launching studies on the potential contribution of some of the SSRI drugs and some of the other psychiatric drugs that might be contributing to violence. You know, many of them on there have black box warnings that warn of suicidal ideation and homicidal ideation. We can't exclude those as a culprit, and those are the kind of studies that we're doing. ”The shooter, Robin Westman, reportedly left a manifesto written in Russian Cyrillic script detailing struggles with gender identity, mental health, and a belief they were terminally ill.“I am severely depressed and have been suicidal for years,” Westman wrote, according to The New York Post.While Westman’s prescription history remains unclear, the incident has renewed public scrutiny around psychiatric medications.This is the second case of a transgender individual involved in a school shooting in the past two years.SSRIs like Lexapro and Zoloft - commonly prescribed for depression - are known to carry black box warnings about increased risks of suicidal thoughts and aggressive behavior in individuals under 25. According to past NIH studies, these medications, along with Varenicline, have been among the drugs most frequently associated with violence towards others.Kennedy’s remarks suggest the Trump administration’s health agencies are taking a broader look at the psychiatric drug landscape, including medications used in gender transition therapies, though no specific drug or patient group has been directly linked to the Minnesota case.","The announcement came during an interview on Fox News following a tragic school shooting in Minnesota this week.

The White House on Thursday clarified that US President Donald Trump is not increasing the number of student visas for Chinese nationals, countering recent speculation over a supposed expansion in student entries.“President Trump isn’t proposing an increase in student visas for Chinese students. The 600k number refers to two years’ worth of visas. It’s simply a continuation of existing policy,” reported Fox News, citing a White House spokesperson.The clarification comes amid rising political backlash online and from some conservative commentators, who interpreted the 600,000 figure as a sign of a significant increase in student visa allocations.The controversy had erupted after Trump said, “we're going to allow their students to come in. It's very important, 600,000 students. It's very important. But we're going to get along with China.”The topic sparked criticism from segments of Trump’s support base, who argued that such a move would be inconsistent with the administration’s broader stance on reducing dependence on China, and also a significant departure from previous restrictive immigration and visa policies.Currently, over 270,000 Chinese students are studying in universities across the US, under existing visa frameworks. The 600,000 figure, the White House said, reflects a two-year cumulative count and does not indicate any policy shift or expansion.The clarification comes amid ongoing trade negotiations between Washington and Beijing, where educational exchanges remain one of the discussion points.The statement reaffirmed that there has been no increase in the number of visas issued under the current administration, and the visa policy remains unchanged.","The White House has clarified that US President Donald Trump is not increasing the number of student visas for Chinese nationals.

US President Donald Trump on Thursday escalated his criticism of Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, citing a fresh spike in gun violence in Chicago and suggesting federal intervention may be necessary if local authorities fail to act.It comes after Trump issued threats to deploy federal troops in America’s third-largest city, to bring down crime.Posting on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump wrote, “Governor Pritzker had 6 murders in Chicago this weekend. 20 people were shot. But he doesn’t want to ask me for help. Can this be possible? The people are desperate for me to STOP THE CRIME, something the Democrats aren’t capable of doing.”The statement follows recent federal law enforcement deployments in cities such as Washington, DC, under Trump’s national anti-crime initiative. These surges involve coordination between federal task forces, immigration and customs enforcement (ICE), and local police, aimed at addressing violent crime and repeat offenders.Trump has repeatedly accused Democratic leaders of failing to address crime in major cities, saying his administration is stepping in where local governments have ""lost control.""His broader messaging continues to frame the issue as a partisan failure, claiming that Democratic-run cities are unable to maintain law and order, branding them incapable of doing so.The current approach, however, has drawn criticism from city officials and civil rights groups, who argue that the presence of out-of-state federal officers - particularly ICE agents - can undermine community trust, especially in immigrant neighborhoods.In DC, mayor Muriel Bowser has raised concerns over masked agents participating in local enforcement, saying it creates confusion and fear among residents. She went on to say that immigrants in the city are living in terror.Trump has also issued similar warnings to officials in Philadelphia, Atlanta, and other cities with persistent crime rates. While he has not confirmed whether Chicago is next in line for a federal deployment, his remarks suggest it remains under consideration.Governor Pritzker is yet to respond to Trump’s comments.

As US President Donald Trump’s federal law enforcement surge nears the end of its third week in Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser has publicly voiced concern over the growing anxiety among residents - especially in immigrant communities.While Bowser acknowledged that the increased federal presence has helped push crime trends in a positive direction, she criticised the role of masked ICE agents and out-of-state national guard troops operating in the city, according to a report by WTOPnews.“There’s tremendous anxiety in the District,” Bowser said at a recent press conference. “When I look and I see residents putting things on social media or neighborhood chats, I know that there is a lot of anxiety. There’s a lot of anxiety with kids going back to school,” as quoted by the portal.The Mayor specifically referred to a recent incident reported by the news agency AP, where federal officers made an arrest near Bancroft Elementary School in Mount Pleasant, prompting chants from residents. Some of the officers reportedly had their faces covered, further intensifying public fear.Bowser confirmed to the portal that US immigration and customs enforcement (ICE) agents have been riding along with DC police officers during traffic stops, particularly those involving mopeds.However, the city, she said, has no access to information about who ICE detains.“I am concerned, for sure, because we think anything that we do and anything that we’re going to ask federal partners to do is focused on violent crime,” she said.DC is home to many residents with temporary protected status, and Bowser warned that the current enforcement approach risks alienating both documented and undocumented individuals.“Whether you have documents or you’re undocumented, you almost feel like you’re being caught up in a dragnet, and that is horrible,” she said. To Hispanic workers living in fear, she added: “I would express to them as a neighbor how very sorry I am that they’re living in this terror,” the mayor was quoted.Police chief Pamela Smith also acknowledged the hesitation among residents to reach out for help due to fear. Deputy mayor for public safety and justice Lindsey Appiah reiterated the city’s appeal: “We do want people to continue to call when they need help.”The federal deployment is currently set to end on September 10 unless President Trump seeks congressional approval for an extension. Bowser said the city would be ready to work with federal resources differently once the 30-day period ends.“We will be prepared to take advantage of additional federal officers to focus on beautification, to support the federal task force, when that time period expires,” she said.Despite tensions, crime in the city is reportedly down compared to the same period last year. Bowser also emphasised the need to strengthen DC’s police force by hiring 500 more officers to reach a 4,000-member target over the coming years.",DC Mayor Muriel Bowser has publicly voiced concern over the growing anxiety among residents - especially in immigrant communities.

ISLAMABAD: Nearly 100 days after Indian fighter jets pounded “terror bases” in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), local police said they have arrested a man who allegedly passed on the GPS coordinates of a mosque that was among those hit.The May 6 raids had left the Bilal Mosque in Muzaffarabad badly damaged, with three fatalities reported. Now, PoK police say Obaid Jahangir of Rawalakot “sold out” by sharing its exact GPS location with India over WhatsApp, allegedly for money.Obaid has been booked under the draconian Official Secrets Act, 1923, with police claiming they had recovered “hard evidence” of espionage. “He passed on sensitive images and the mosque’s coordinates in exchange for hefty payments,” claimed SSP Riaz Mughal of PoK police’s counter-terrorism department (CTD).But the case is already mired in conflicting narratives. Another senior CTD officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, went further, alleging Jahangir had a past with a banned outfit before joining a so-called relief organisation. Investigators, he added, had traced communications with Indian handlers on his phone.The family, however, insists Obaid is no militant. His uncle admitted the 30-something may have “fallen into a money trap” but stressed he was only associated with the Jammu Kashmir United Movement, a relief body.“If he is guilty, he should face the law, but he has never been part of any militant outfit,” the uncle maintained.His lawyer, Abdul Samad, pointed out that the sections invoked against him cover trespassing into restricted areas and passing on information “prejudicial to national security”. Conviction under these clauses carries punishments ranging from 14 years in prison to life.Earlier this year, too, PoK police had arrested a police constable on charges of selling sensitive information across the border.","Indian fighter jets pounded ‘terror bases’ in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) Nearly 100 days later, local police said they have arrested a man who allegedly passed on the GPS coordinates of a mosque.

Pakistan blaze: Fireworks warehouse explosion injures at least 25; fire triggers road closures in Karachi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-blaze-fireworks-warehouse-explosion-injures-at-least-25-fire-triggers-road-closures-in-karachi/articleshow/123434002.cms,"



At least 25 people, including some in critical condition, were injured after an explosion took place at a fireworks storage facility in Karachi, Pakistan.Thick smoke could be seen billowing into the sky from the building where firecrackers were stored, according to television footage.Witnesses cited by AP said that broken glass from nearby shops covered the road and panicked residents fled the scene.Firefighters rushed to extinguish the blaze while ambulances ferried the injured, including passers-by, to hospitals.Senior police official Asad Raza said several shops and vehicles on Jinnah Road were damaged in the blast. The cause of the explosion was not immediately known.The fire was reported in a warehouse near Taj Complex on MA Jinnah Road, a Rescue 1122 spokesperson said, adding,“as soon as Rescue 1122’s Central Command and Control team received the information, the Fire and Rescue team reached the scene along with an ambulance and two fire brigade trucks.”Police surgeon Summaiya Syed told Dawn, “Sixteen injured at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre [with] two critical. Fourteen at Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Trauma Centre,” adding that the warehouse had been storing firecrackers.Karachi traffic police said MA Jinnah Road had been closed due to the fire, with traffic from Numaish being diverted towards Society Signal and Ali Raza Imambargah.Citizens were advised to call the Traffic Police helpline at 1915 for alternate routes “to avoid inconvenience,” the Dawn reported.Sindh CM Murad Ali Shah took notice of the incident and directed officials to control the blaze and ensure no lives were lost. According to a statement, he also ordered the Karachi Commissioner to provide immediate medical assistance to the injured and submit a detailed report. “There is no permission to produce materials near cities or populated areas which can cause damage,” CM Murad was quoted as saying.The Sindh home ministry later issued a statement saying 20 people had been injured in the blaze.Home minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar directed police reinforcements to the scene, saying, “Police reinforcements should be sent to rescue the injured and transfer them quickly to the nearest hospital. An investigation must be completed and a report submitted soon.”Lanjar also instructed investigators to include statements from the injured and evidence from the scene, Dawn furthed added.Explosions at fireworks facilities are not uncommon in Pakistan. In January, six people were killed in a similar blast at a fireworks storage site in Mandi Bahauddin, Punjab province. Fires in commercial and residential buildings are also frequent, largely blamed on poor infrastructure, weak enforcement of safety rules, and negligence.","At least 25 people, including some in critical condition, injured after explosion at fireworks storage facility in Karachi, Pakistan.

"Violence against minorities in Pakistan: Conversions, blasphemy killings on rise",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/violence-against-minorities-in-pakistan-conversions-blasphemy-killings-on-rise-what-human-rights-panel-said/articleshow/123431097.cms,"Forced conversions

Targeting Ahmadiyya community



Blasphemy accusations







The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has raised alarm over violence against minority communities in the country.HRCP on Thursday released its latest report, Streets of Fear: Freedom of Religion or Belief in 2024/25, documenting violations of freedom of religion or belief (FORB) between 1 July 2024 and 30 June 2025.The report painted a picture as grim as in previous years, recording targeted killings, forced conversions, mob lynchings, hate speech, desecration of places of worship and extrajudicial killings. It also warned that religious freedom in Pakistan is facing an unprecedented threat.The HRCP highlighted several cases where individuals were killed over blasphemy accusations, describing the trend as deeply troubling in a country that has already witnessed the assassination of a provincial governor by his own security guard.The HRCP report noted that the pattern of minor non-Muslim girls disappearing and later resurfacing after allegedly converting to Islam and marrying Muslim men persisted in 2024/25.Hindus in Sindh, who form 8.8% of the population, and Christians in Punjab (1.9%), have raised repeated concerns. A fact-finding study found that forced conversions and coerced marriages remain most prevalent among Scheduled Caste Hindus due to poverty and limited social mobility.The report highlighted the role of cleric-politician Mian Abdul Haq, or Mian Mithu, accused of using his influence to facilitate conversions at his seminary in Ghotki. He was sanctioned by the UK in 2022.The report also cited cases where police were seen siding with abductors, often claiming it would be “haram” to return a girl after conversion.In July 2024, Faisalabad police recovered Christian minor Laiba Suhail, abducted in February and forcibly converted before being married off illegally. Another girl, Alina, is still missing. In January 2025, a Mirpurkhas court heard a plea from a couple accused of forcing an underage Hindu girl to convert and marry.Other cases were reported across provinces: in April 2025, 14-year-old a Hindu girl, Chahat disappeared in Quetta and later claimed in a video to have converted, though her parents produced documents proving she was underage.In May, Hindu Panchayats in Ghotki and Rohri protested the disappearance of a Meghwar teenager in Rohri, fearing abduction for forced conversion. In June, civil society groups and Hindu Panchayats in Larkana expressed concern over three minor girls and a teenage boy from Shahdadpur allegedly being forced to convert.The HRCP stressed that such cases continue to deepen insecurity among religious minorities and called for protective measures to safeguard vulnerable children and their families.The report listed multiple killings of Ahmadis: dentist Zakaur Rahman in Lalamusa (July 2024), Tayyab Ahmad in Rawalpindi (December 2024), Amir Hasan in Naukot (December 2024), Laeeq Cheema lynched in Karachi (April 2025), Muhammad Asif in Kasur (April 2025), and senior doctor Mahmood Sheikh in Sargodha (May 2025).The UN warned, “We are alarmed by ongoing reports of violence and discrimination against the Ahmadiyya community in Pakistan.”“According to the data provided by the Ahmadiyya community, 29 Ahmadi places of worship were attacked and damaged during the review period,” the report said.It further added that in 26 cases, the demolition was carried out by law enforcement agencies.“These incidents occurred in Okara, Khanewal, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Vehari, Sheikhupura, Gujrat, and Sargodha, among other locations Back in January, a historic Sialkot site linked to Pakistan’s first foreign minister Zafarullah Khan was “reduced to rubble”.The report said that the blasphemy law has been often misused to settle personal scores or seek financial gain in Pakistan, where, a ‘mere accusation of blasphemy can be a death sentence.’In September, last year, two men accused of blasphemy were killed while in police custody less than a week apart. One was inexplicably shot and killed in Mirpurkhas during an alleged police encounter, and the other was killed by a police constable inside a police station in Quetta.On 12 September 2024, constable Saad Khan Sarhadi shot dead Abdul Ali, a blasphemy suspect, inside Quetta’s Cantonment Police Station after mobs from religious parties gathered outside demanding his custody. It marked the first such incident in the city where a serving officer killed a suspect in custody. Days later, Ali’s family pardoned Sarhadi, while lawyers and a JUI-F senator pledged legal support for him.Later, on 17 September 2024, Shahnawaz Kunbhar, a civil hospital employee from Umerkot, fled to Karachi after a cleric accused him of posting blasphemous content. He denied the charge in a video message before being arrested by police, who assured his family of protection. Two days later, police claimed he was killed in an encounter, with officers celebrated as heroes.His family was prevented from burying him by armed mobs, and the body was desecrated. Following outrage from rights groups, a Sindh police inquiry declared the encounter “fake.”The report also showed that the mainstream media largely ignored issues of religious freedom under the period covered. Even the Islamabad High Court’s hearings into the “blasphemy business group,” affecting nearly 400 households and livestreamed for four months, drew little coverage. Likewise, cases of coerced marriages, forced conversions and violence against minorities rarely made headlines.A worrying trend has emerged in Pakistan, where ultra-right-wing groups are exerting growing pressure on the judiciary and elected officials through propaganda and intimidation, it added.","The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has raised alarm over violence against minority communities in the country.

’14 Pakistani Soldiers Killed’: Baloch Rebels Attack Day After India’s Strike On Terror Hubs | Watch





The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for an attack in Panjgur that left four Pakistan 's army personnel dead. According to BLA spokesperson Jeeyand Baloch, fighters launched a raid in the Surdu area of Panjgur on Tuesday night, eliminating a key operative of the Pakistan army.The statement revealed that Ghulam Sarwar had earlier established and commanded a so-called death squad under the protection of the Pakistani military. This squad, which had been active for years in Gichek and other parts of Panjgur, was later led by his son, Islam Sarwar. The group allegedly supported the army's operations, carrying out targeted killings, enforced disappearances, and other violent acts. In return, the army reportedly allowed them to freely engage in drug trafficking, kidnappings for ransom and extortion through road checkpoints.During the operation, BLA fighters seized three Kalashnikov rifles, an M-4, additional weapons, two vehicles, and three motorcycles from Islam Sarwar's hideout. The site, according to the BLA, also served as a torture chamber, where electric shock devices and other tools of abuse were found. Islam Sarwar was accused of abducting and killing a young man in Panjgur just two months earlier. Jeeyand Baloch warned that the Pakistani army and its allies would be held accountable for crimes against the Baloch people.The BLA's latest offensive is part of the ongoing insurgency in Balochistan , where separatist groups are demanding greater autonomy and recognition of Baloch rights. In recent years, attacks on military and paramilitary forces, along with government facilities, have intensified.Separatist factions argue that the Baloch people face systemic marginalisation and exploitation, despite the province's wealth in natural resources. In response, Pakistan's military has pursued counterinsurgency campaigns to suppress the rebellion. However, human rights groups have repeatedly raised concerns over reports of forced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, and excessive force during these operations.Numerous accounts point to the widespread issue of disappearances, with civilians and activists allegedly detained without due legal process. Rights organisations argue that such tactics fuel fear and deepen mistrust, further straining relations between the Pakistani state and the Baloch population.","Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for an attack in Panjgur that left four Pakistan's army personnel dead.
