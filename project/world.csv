'Needle is moving towards negotiation than continuation of war': Jaishankar on India's role in Russia-Ukraine conflict,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/needle-is-moving-towards-negotiation-than-continuation-of-war-jaishankar-on-indias-role-in-russia-ukraine-conflict/articleshow/116078996.cms,"(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Saturday detailed how India has been walking the talk by engaging directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv, transparently carrying messages between the two sides.He outlined India’s proactive diplomatic efforts in addressing global conflicts, including the Russia-Ukraine war and tensions in the Gulf and Mediterranean regions and expressed hope for identifying ""common threads"" that could pave the way for meaningful negotiations when the time is right.Speaking at the Doha Forum, Jaishankar said, ""(We are trying to) find common threads which can be picked up at some point of time when the circumstances are right for it to be developed.""When asked about India's role in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Jaishankar said, ""The general sort of needle is moving more towards the reality of a negotiation than the continuation of the war,"" he said.Jaishankar stressed that the war has had widespread repercussions on developing nations, including rising fuel costs, food, inflation, and fertilizers.He said that India is articulating the sentiments and interests of the Global South — 125 countries affected by this war. ""And, in the last few weeks and months, I've even seen this sentiment expressed by major European leaders, who are actually telling us, please keep engaging Russia and engaging Ukraine. So we do think that things are moving somewhere in that direction,” he added.He underscored the need for more innovative and participatory diplomacy to address the world’s pressing challenges.Reflecting on the broader conflict landscape, he cited ongoing tensions in the Gulf, the Red Sea, and the Mediterranean, mentioning Israel-Iran hostilities and the disruption of shipping routes impacting Asia.Jaishankar said that diplomats must recognize the messy realities of the world and step forward. He also said the era of the 60s and the 70s when the UN Security Council or a few Western powers managed conflicts is ""behind us,"" adding that all countries need to step forward.Jaishankar spoke on other key issues, including speculation around the Brics currency and recent remarks by US President-elect Donald Trump threatening tariffs on Brics countries. “India has never advocated de-dollarization, and there is no proposal for a Brics currency at the moment. Countries within Brics hold varied positions on this matter,” he said.On questions about the emergence of an anti-Western axis involving Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran, Jaishankar said, “Countries align and diverge based on interests. The global reality is far more complex than sweeping generalizations,”Jaishankar’s remarks came as part of the 22nd edition of the Doha Forum, a global platform that fosters dialogue on critical challenges and drives innovative, action-oriented solutions.Themed “The Innovation Imperative,” the forum emphasises diplomacy, dialogue, and diversity as tools to address interconnected global challenges.","S Jaishankar outlined India’s proactive diplomatic efforts in addressing global conflicts.

Police have described the accused as ""remorseless"" and possibly a ""psychopath,"" as per reports from news agency PTI.The incident occurred on Friday afternoon at Dhamora Government High School. According to investigators, the student followed Saxena, 55, into the washroom and shot him in the head with a locally-made pistol. The teenager then calmly walked into the principal's office, took his scooter keys, and fled the scene along with a classmate. He was apprehended hours later near the Uttar Pradesh border, still armed with the weapon.Police revealed that the alleged shooter had a history of disciplinary issues and had frequently been admonished by Saxena for his behaviour. ""The accused claims he killed the principal because he often scolded him and told him not to indulge in 'goondaism' at school,"" an investigator said to PTI. Despite the gravity of the act, the boy has shown no remorse. ""He appears to have a psychopathic tendency,"" the official added.Saxena, who had been the principal of the school for five years, was described by his colleagues as a kind and dedicated educator who often went beyond the call of duty for his students. Teachers were left in shock as there were no known disputes that could have led to such an extreme act.Superintendent of Police Agam Jain stated that the boy had skipped school on Friday and was spotted by Saxena near the gate, leading to yet another warning.

The classmate who fled with him on the scooter has been detained for questioning, with authorities seeking to determine his role in the incident.The firearm used in the killing has been traced back to a man from the accused's village, who had since moved to Raipur and died two months ago.

HYDERABAD: Revathi and Mogadampalli Bhaskar's son Sritej, 9, became a fan of Telugu actor Allu Arjun after watching 'Pushpa: The Rise' three years ago, so much so that neighbours nicknamed him 'Pushpa'.As Sritej battled for life in a Hyderabad hospital on Thursday and his mother's body lay in a mortuary, an inconsolable Bhaskar wondered if 32-year-old Revathi lost her life by putting family above self, as always.She died in the stampede at a city theatre the previous night during the premiere of the sequel to the 2021 'Pushpa' film.""She gave me life, and now she's gone,"" the 40-year-old said.

Wednesday was supposed to be a special movie night for them, with Arjun being in attendance at the premiere in Sandhya Theatre. Revathi was with Sritej when the stampede broke out, trapping both in a melee of frantic feet. Bhaskar had moved away with Sanvi earlier because the girl started crying amid jostling by fans desperate for a glimpse of the film star.""I decided to drop Sanvi at my in-laws' home in the lane next to the theatre. By the time I returned, my wife and son weren't where I left them. When I called, Revathi said they were inside the theatre... That was the last I heard her voice,"" Bhasker said, breaking down.The bereaved husband believes Revathi was fatally injured in trying to protect their son as the unruly crowd scrambled to escape a police baton charge.Even as he waited outside Gandhi Hospital mortuary, Bhaskar worried about his son who is in a hospital room a few kilometres away, having suffered ""severe hypoxia and potential lung injury"". ""I remember someone showing me a video where Sritej was being carried in a stranger's arms, then being taken in a patrol car that stopped at Chikkadpally police station. He was motionless as they drove him to KIMS Hospital,"" said the anxious father.""I didn't get any updates about Revathi until 2.30am Thursday. That's when some cops broke the news to me, and my world crashed.""Bhaskar has since being trying to convince himself to ""stay strong"" for Sanvi.

Who Is Bashar al-Assad? The Syrian President who fled Damascus as rebels advanced,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/who-is-bashar-al-assad-the-syrian-president-who-fled-damascus-as-rebels-advanced/articleshow/116094746.cms,"Who is Bashar al-Assad?

Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has presided over a brutal crackdown on a pro-democracy uprising that evolved into one of the deadliest conflicts of the century.

Having suppressed widespread protests calling for his removal and crushed an armed rebellion, Assad had, until recently, regained control of much of Syria in the civil war that began in 2011.

Known for his quiet demeanor, Assad has proven to be a skilled political survivor, adept at forging alliances with Russia and Iran while portraying himself as Syria's only viable leader against the Islamist threat. However, since November 27, an Islamist-led rebel offensive has seized several key cities, including Aleppo and Hama, for the first time since 2011, leaving Assad’s hold on power in jeopardy.

He has long framed himself as a protector of Syria's minorities and a barrier against extremism, emphasizing his role as a stabilizing force in the war-torn nation.

Over the years, Assad has claimed sweeping victories in elections held exclusively in government-controlled areas, elections Western nations have criticized as neither free nor fair.

Typically dressed in sharp business suits rather than military attire, Assad projects a calm, almost reserved image in official appearances, interviews, and even on the frontlines.

Assad’s path to leadership was unexpected. Initially pursuing a career in ophthalmology, his life took a dramatic turn in 1994 when his older brother, Bassel, who was groomed for the presidency, died in a car accident.

Bashar left his studies in London—where he had met his wife, Asma, a British-Syrian Sunni Muslim and former JP Morgan employee—and returned to Syria. There, he undertook military training and received political guidance from his father.

Upon his father’s death, Bashar assumed the presidency through an uncontested referendum and secured a second term in 2007.

Sworn in at 34, Assad was initially seen as a potential reformer, offering hope to Syrians yearning for freedom and economic modernization. Early in his presidency, he was occasionally seen driving his own car or dining publicly with his wife, Asma

Hafez al-Assad was the president of Syria from 1970 until his death in 2000, a leader who shaped the country through a combination of military dominance, political maneuvering, and brutal repression.

from 1970 until his death in 2000, a leader who shaped the country through a combination of military dominance, political maneuvering, and brutal repression. Born into the Alawite minority , a sect of Shia Islam, Assad rose to prominence within the Syrian military, particularly during the sectarian power struggles that gripped the country in the 1960s.

, a sect of Shia Islam, Assad rose to prominence within the Syrian military, particularly during the sectarian power struggles that gripped the country in the 1960s. As defense minister and air force commander, he played a key role in the 1966 struggle for power within the Baath Party, ultimately seizing control in a bloodless coup on November 13, 1970. This marked the end of Syria's tenth military coup in seventeen years, bringing a fragile stability to a country long plagued by turmoil.

Assad consolidated his power by using the Baath Party as a facade while positioning members of the Alawite minority in crucial military and intelligence roles, particularly within the special forces and armored corps.

In 1982, when Muslim extremists in Hama rebelled, Assad's forces carried out a brutal crackdown, leveling much of the city and killing thousands of civilians.

While Assad's rule was marked by severe repression, many Syrians appreciated the relative stability and order he brought to a country that had experienced nearly constant upheaval since gaining independence.

He ruled through emergency decrees for over three decades, leaving behind a legacy of both fear and admiration. After his death in 2000, Syria came under the control of his son, Bashar al-Assad.

As rebels advanced on the Syrian capital, anti-regime protests intensified across the country. In the Jermana suburb, just ten kilometers from central Damascus, demonstrators brought down the statue of Hafez al-Assad , the late father of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad on Saturday. The act of defiance was followed by the destruction of a statue of Bashar’s late brother, Bassel al-Assad, in Aleppo, a city that had also witnessed mounting resistance.In addition to toppling statues, protesters tore down posters of both Bashar and Hafez al-Assad, challenging the personality cult that had been meticulously cultivated around them by the ruling Baath Party .","Hafez al-Assad was the president of Syria from 1970 until his death in 2000.

South Korea president Yoon narrowly escaped an impeachment vote as his party, the People power party (PPP), managed to block the motion on Saturday. However, the repercussions of the martial law declaration on the political future of the president continue to unfold.The political landscape in South Korea has entered a state of turmoil following the controversial declaration of martial law earlier this week. This unprecedented move, which briefly suspended civilian governance, has triggered widespread protests and has drawn severe criticism both domestically and internationally.Despite the PPP's efforts to shield president Yoon from impeachment, the party has indicated that he has effectively agreed to step down, leaving him sidelined from governance until his resignation is formalised. Discussions are set to take place between party leaders and prime minister Han Duck-soo to strategise an ""orderly retreat"" for Yoon.Opposition leaders, including Lee Jae-myung, have vowed to persist in their campaign against Yoon, with plans for another impeachment attempt as early as Wednesday.Massive demonstrations erupted outside the National assembly during the impeachment vote, with organisers claiming participation from over a million individuals, while police estimates were significantly lower at around 150,000. Protesters, undeterred by the freezing temperatures, chanted for Yoon’s ouster and waved LED candles in a powerful display of dissent.In a significant development, defence minister Kim Yong-hyun, who played a pivotal role in the implementation of the martial law order, was arrested on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: A 56-year-old businessman was gunned down by two bike-borne assailants at Farsh Bazar in east Delhi on Saturday morning.The deceased was identified as Sunil Jain, who lived with his family in Krishna Nagar and ran a business selling utensils. He was returning home from a morning walk when he was shot dead. Jain was riding pillion on a scooter which his friend Sumit was riding. As they reached near the traffic light, two men on a bike approached them, shot Jain dead and fled the scene. Sumit escaped unhurt and was taken to the police station as he was the prime witness in the case.While the circumstantial evidence points towards a targeted killing , a set of investigators believe that Jain may have been killed in a case of mistaken identity. Some witnesses claimed that the shooters fired over 12 times, while police said they found 7-8 empty cartridges, suggesting that 4-5 bullets may have hit the Jain.Deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara) Prashant Gautam said they received information about the incident at 8.26am on Saturday. A team from the local police station rushed to the spot, which was located near Mandir Mata Chintpurni Marg in Vishwas Nagar, close to the DCP Shahdara office and Krishna Nagar police station. Jain's utensil shop was situated approximately 500 metres away from the spot.Surender, who works at a shop in the area, said he heard the gunshot and started running towards the sound, where he saw the body. He said he heard from people who were present at the spot that when Jain was shot, he urged the assailants not to kill him and to take whatever they wanted, but they replied that they would take his life. Both the men were wearing helmets.Sitaram, a shopkeeper, said he was on his way to work when he mistook the gunfire for the sound of a motorcycle silencer. Only when he emerged from his home did he see the businessman’s body.Churchill Jain, a resident of the area, said that Jain was a regular morning walker. He would leave for Yamuna Sports Complex in the morning, meet his friends -a group of 20-25 people -and exercise together. On his way back, he would often stop for tea or pick up milk before returning home. His shop workers said that he would typically arrive at the shop around 9.30am.“What I heard is that the duo shot him in the head before fleeing the spot,” the officer said. The location where the incident took place is a busy area with several shops and hotels, and the road remains busy throughout. It has two CCTV cameras installed nearby.The deceased's family claimed that he had no enmity with anyone. Ekansh Jain, a relative, said that Jain's friends informed his family about the incident. When asked whether Jain received any extortion calls or threats, Ekansh denied it. “He was someone who avoided confrontations and disagreements with others,” he added. Police are investigating the motive from different angles.","A 56-year-old businessman was gunned down by two bike-borne assailants at Farsh Bazar in east Delhi on Saturday morning.

Where is Syrian President Assad? Questions mount as rebels enter Damascus,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/where-is-syrian-president-assad-questions-mount-as-rebels-close-in-on-damascus/articleshow/116094668.cms,"(AFP photo)

Rebel gains spark reports of Assad fleeing Syria



Assad's alleged flight sparks rumours



Rebel advance threatens Assad strongholds



Iranian and Hezbollah forces retreat



A sectarian divide deepens



'Red line'



As rebel forces breach the outskirts of Damascus, speculation about the whereabouts of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad dominates discussion both within and beyond the war-torn country. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported on Sunday that Assad has left Syria via Damascus International Airport following significant territorial losses to a rapid rebel offensive.However, this report has not been independently verified by AFP, deepening the mystery around Assad’s whereabouts as his regime faces its greatest challenge in decades.There are also conflicting reports coming out of his alleged flights to Russia and Jordan.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that President Bashar al-Assad has left Syria via Damascus International Airport, following significant territorial losses to a rapid rebel offensive. According to Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman, Assad's departure occurred before army security forces vacated the airport.Reports swirling across Syria claim Assad could be in Russia or Jordan, sparking rumours of his departure amid one of the most severe challenges to the Assad family’s half-century of rule. Flight records from Damascus are being scrutinised, adding to the uncertainty. Despite official statements that the president remains in the capital, Assad has not been publicly seen, fueling further speculation.Rebel factions have made a rapid advance through western Syria, capturing strategic cities like Homs and Aleppo, leaving the government in control of only three provincial capitals: Damascus, Latakia, and Tartus.The government’s ""ring of steel"" around Damascus has failed to prevent the collapse of major strongholds, as symbols of Assad’s regime, including statues of his father and brother, are torn down in newly captured areas.Assad’s allies are also retreating. Lebanese Hezbollah fighters have vacated positions around Damascus and Homs, with reports indicating some have moved to Latakia or back to Lebanon. Iran, a critical ally, has been unable to provide the same level of support as in the past due to distractions from other regional conflicts.The Syrian conflict, rooted in calls for reform, has transformed into a sectarian battle. Assad, an Alawite leader, has long positioned himself as a defender against Sunni Islamist factions. However, the rise of groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), rooted in al-Qaeda, has added sectarian tensions, even as these groups attempt to reassure minorities of their safety.Assad has been backed by Syrians who saw him as a bulwark against hardline Sunni Islamists, though critics accuse him of fueling sectarianism. Despite his portrayal of Syria as a secular state, the conflict deepened along sectarian lines with Iranian-backed Shi'ite militias supporting Assad and Sunni-led states like Turkey and Qatar aiding the rebels.Iran declared Assad’s survival a “red line,” while the US failed to enforce its own against chemical weapons use. After a 2013 sarin gas attack killed hundreds, Moscow brokered the destruction of Syria’s chemical stockpile. However, further gas attacks, including one in 2017, prompted limited US retaliation. Assad has denied the state involvement.","Reports claim President Bashar al-Assad has left Syria via Damascus International Airport.

Several weeks ago, whilst driving with her children Kat Dunbar , a 37-year-old acupuncturist, noticed this peculiar sight, New York Times reported.""I was like, 'What is that? Is that a UFO?'"" said Dunbar. ""And we watched it the whole way home."" They were drones, she realised.""In the last week, it became a little bit of a menacing and, like, creepy thing,"" Kat Dunbar said.Several videos on the online space are being circulated claiming that they observed an UFO in sky.""Morris county drones they just kept coming #nj drones #ufo # New Jersey drones #drones NJ,"" a user said on X while another user said, ""Triangle Shaped “Drones” spotted over New Jersey tonight from multiple witnesses.""Since mid-November, drone sightings have been reported across at least 10 New Jersey counties. These devices have been observed near critical infrastructure, including reservoirs, power lines, railways, residential areas and motorways. They typically operate in groups, producing a distinctive hum that Nick Dunbar, 39, likens to electric vehicle sounds. These drones appear substantially larger than standard consumer models.The Federal Aviation Administration responded by implementing temporary drone restrictions over a Morris County military facility and a golf club owned by President-elect Donald Trump. On November 26, drone activity prevented a medical helicopter from retrieving an accident victim in Somerset County, according to NJ.com.State officials maintain these drones pose no public danger, yet questions about their operators and purpose remain unanswered.Local law enforcement expresses concern about these sightings. Florham Park's police chief described the drone presence as ""nefarious in nature"". Hunterdon County officials reported drone activity near their emergency communications centre and Round Valley Reservoir, New Jersey's largest water source.The sightings have spread to southern New Jersey, Philadelphia suburbs and coastal areas.

Last December, drones surrounded Langley Air Force Base in Virginia for 17 days, with comparable sightings near a California base this year.Recently, the US Navy reported ""small unmanned aerial systems"" near four US military bases in Britain.

Syrian opposition fighters on Sunday reportedly entered the capital city of Damascus in a rapid offensive, posing a significant challenge to President Bashar Assad 's rule. This marks the first time rebels have reached Damascus' outskirts since 2018.The Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), Syria's strongest insurgent group, along with the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army , launched the offensive on November 27th. They quickly captured Aleppo, Syria's largest city, and Hama, the fourth largest.HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani stated the offensive aims to overthrow Assad's government. ""The aim of the offensive is to overthrow Assad's government,"" al-Golani said. The HTS, despite its origins in al-Qaida, claims to have severed ties with the organization.The alliance between HTS and the Syrian National Army is potentially fragile. The Turkish-backed groups want a buffer zone near Turkey's border, and Turkey, while previously supporting anti-Assad fighters, has recently pushed for reconciliation and denies involvement in the current offensive. The future cooperation of these groups remains uncertain.Simultaneously, other opposition groups have mobilized. Local forces have taken control in Sweida, home to Syria's Druze minority, and Daraa, a Sunni Muslim area and a center of the 2011 uprising. The Syrian Democratic Forces, a US-backed Kurdish-led group, control much of eastern Syria. Assad's government now holds only Damascus, Latakia, and Tartus, three of the 14 provincial capitals.Insurgent commander Hassan Abdul-Ghani stated on Telegram that opposition forces have begun the 'final stage' by surrounding Damascus. Syrian troops also withdrew from Homs, Syria's third-largest city. Losing Homs would sever the connection between Damascus and the coastal region, Assad's stronghold.Assad's allies, Russia and Iran, are preoccupied with other conflicts, and Hezbollah, weakened by the war with Israel, offers limited support. The UN is pushing for talks regarding a political transition in Syria.

'Assad has left Damascus'



Hezbollah withdraws forces from Damascus outskirts, Homs



Intense gunfire sounds in Damascus



'Assad is gone, Homs is free'



'This is not our fight'



Doha diplomacy

Syrian rebel forces have reached Damascus as the capital city's defence forces collapsed and intense gunfire sounds were heard as reported by multiple residents of the city. This comes after the rebels captured Homs and Aleppo posing a threat to the 24-year-old rule of President Bashar Assad.“Militarily, Damascus has fallen,” a source familiar with the rebels told CNN.The recent advances by opposition factions, including a significant push by a group with roots in al-Qaida, are among the largest in years.This group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which is designated as a terrorist organization by both the US and the United Nations, has made substantial progress in its efforts to overthrow Assad's government. The insurgents have faced minimal resistance from the Syrian army during their offensive.Syrian President Bashar al-Assad boarded a plane and left Damascus for an undisclosed location on Sunday, according to two senior army officers.However, this comes only a day after his office said that the president Bashar al-Assad was still carrying out his duties from Damascus, rejecting reports that he had fled as rebels moved closer to the capital.Hezbollah has withdrawn its forces from the outskirts of Damascus and the Homs region, according to a source close to the Lebanese group.The group ""has instructed its fighters in recent hours to withdraw from the Homs area, with some heading to Latakia (in Syria) and others to the Hermel area in Lebanon"", AFP reported quoting a source, and noted that ""Hezbollah fighters have also vacated their positions around Damascus.""Intense gunfire was heard in the center of Damascus on Sunday, as rebels advanced towards the Syrian capital, according to two residents living near the city's heart, Reuters reported.The source of the shooting remained unclear. Meanwhile, Syrian rebels claimed full control of the strategic city of Homs after just one day of fighting.Syrian rebels announced they had taken full control of the crucial city of Homs early on Sunday after just one day of fighting, further threatening President Bashar al-Assad’s 24-year rule as insurgents advanced on the capital, Damascus.As the army withdrew, thousands of Homs residents filled the streets, celebrating with chants of ""Assad is gone, Homs is free"" and ""Long live Syria, down with Bashar al-Assad.""Rebels fired into the air in triumph, while youths tore down posters of the Syrian president, marking a dramatic week-long collapse of Assad's territorial control.US President-elect Donald Trump said that the US had nothing to do with the conflict in Syria as the latter ""was not a friend.""""Syria is a mess, but is not our friend, & THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT. LET IT PLAY OUT. DO NOT GET INVOLVED!,"" Trump said in a post on his social media platform Truth Social.Trump said that Russia, distracted by its war in Ukraine, ""seems incapable of stopping this literal march through Syria, a country they have protected for years."" He suggested that if Russia were forced out of Syria, it ""may actually be the best thing that can happen to them"" because ""there was never much of a benefit in Syria for Russia.""The foreign ministers of Iran, Russia, and Turkey, meeting in Qatar, called for an end to the ongoing hostilities. Turkey, a key supporter of the rebels, participated in the discussions.“Assad didn’t seize this opportunity to start engaging and restoring his relationship with his people,” Qatar's top diplomat, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said, AP reported.He expressed surprise at the rapid advance of the rebels, warning that there is a serious threat to Syria's ""territorial integrity.""

Police probing whether special gun used to kill Thompson



Suspect uses false identity



In the UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson murder case , after finding the suspect's bag, the NYPD divers searched Central Park's Lake on Saturday for the weapon used, whilst the manhunt enters its fourth day.The search was concentrated near the park's boathouse and Bethesda Fountain. Investigators still seek two crucial pieces of evidence: the suspect's electric bicycle and the murder weapon.Authorities discovered a backpack in the park on Friday evening, which is undergoing forensic analysis in Queens. Officials confirmed the backpack contained no firearm but included a Tommy Hilfiger jacket, CNN reported.The NYPD is receiving assistance from federal investigators to analyse evidence, including the backpack, photographs, video footage, ammunition, and DNA samples. They believe the suspect has left the city.The FBI has announced a $50,000 reward for information leading to arrest and conviction, whilst the NYPD offers an additional $10,000 reward.Officials believe the suspect, who arrived in New York via Greyhound from Atlanta last month, has departed the city by interstate bus. NYPD detectives have travelled to Atlanta to advance the investigation, with support from local police.Mayor Eric Adams highlighted the backpack discovery as a positive development, stating they would identify and apprehend the suspect.“The net is tightening,” Mayor Adams told reporters at a Police Athletic League holiday party in Harlem on Saturday.Mayor Adams declined to say whether investigators already had the suspect’s name when asked at a Harlem event.“We don’t want to release that now,” Adams said. “If we do, we are basically giving a tip to the person we are seeking and we do not want to give him an upper hand at all. Let him continue to believe he can hide behind the mask. We revealed his face. We’re going to reveal who he is and we’re going to bring him to justice.”Investigators are scrutinising surveillance images of an unmasked individual released on Thursday. Commissioner Jessica Tisch reported substantial evidence collection, including fingerprints and extensive CCTV footage of the suspect's movements.Chief Detective Joseph Kenny indicated they're investigating whether a specialised weapon was used. Border authorities on both Canadian and Mexican frontiers have been alerted.Cops are probing whether the weapon used was a “veterinary” gun commonly used to euthanize animals, an NYPD official said, New York Post reported.The murder weapon used in the assassination of Thompson “appears to be a larger handgun” similar to the style of a veterinary gun , NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said.“It’s a weapon commonly used on farms and ranches. If an animal has to get put down, the animal can be shot without causing a loud noise,” Kenny explained Friday, but the lead proved a dead end, sources told The Post.The weapon is believed to be a modernized version of a World War-II style gun called a Welrod, sources said. Modern versions of the firearm are known as VP-9 or Station 6.The suspect reportedly used false identification to book accommodation at an Upper West Side hostel after arriving on November 24. Evidence includes hostel photographs, a disposable phone, and a water bottle from the crime scene.Ammunition recovered bore the words ""delay,"" ""deny"" and ""depose,"" potentially linking to insurance industry criticism.

US Tiktok Ban: TikTok faces looming ban in US as appeals court upholds divestment law,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tiktok-faces-looming-ban-in-us-as-appeals-court-upholds-divestment-law/articleshow/116054242.cms,"TikTok faces looming ban in US as appeals court upholds divestment law (Picture credit: AP)

Contested future for TikTok

Political dynamics

Implications for tech landscape

A US federal appeals court has upheld a law requiring ByteDance, the China-based parent company of TikTok, to divest its US operations by January 19, 2025, or face a nationwide ban on the app.The decision, delivered on Friday, intensifies the platform's legal and operational challenges while escalating tensions between the United States and China.The ruling by a three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia was described as a significant victory for the Justice Department, which has long argued that TikTok poses a national security threat.The court stated that the divestment law passed with bipartisan support, was designed to protect US national security interests against potential threats from China's influence over the app.TikTok, which boasts 170 million users in the United States, is expected to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court.The company argues that the divestment law infringes on First Amendment rights and constitutes censorship. ""The Supreme Court has a strong track record of defending Americans' free speech, and we are confident they will uphold this principle in our case,"" TikTok said in a statement.The law prohibits app stores and internet hosting services from offering TikTok after the deadline unless ByteDance sells its US operations.While ByteDance has denied allegations of sharing data with the Chinese government, US officials have raised concerns over data security and potential manipulation of information on the platform.The decision leaves the ultimate enforcement of the ban in the hands of President Joe Biden, who could grant a 90-day extension if significant progress is made toward a sale, and President-elect Donald Trump, who will take office the day after the January 19 deadline.Trump, who attempted to ban TikTok in 2020, has since reversed his stance, expressing opposition to a ban during his recent presidential campaign.The ruling is already drawing criticism from free speech advocates. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) called the decision ""flawed and dangerous,"" arguing it sets a troubling precedent for censorship.If enforced, the ban could significantly reshape the social media landscape, benefiting rivals such as Meta and Alphabet's YouTube. Meta's shares surged following the ruling, reflecting investor optimism about reduced competition in the online advertising space.Despite the uncertainty, TikTok has continued to expand its US operations, including reporting $100 million in Black Friday sales through its e-commerce venture.However, analysts warn that a ban could disrupt content creators and businesses dependent on the platform while deepening the rift in US-China relations.As the deadline looms, all eyes are on the Supreme Court and the incoming administration to determine TikTok's fate in the United States.","Appeals court upholds law requiring ByteDance to sell US operations by January 19, 2025.

President Emmanuel Macron hosted trilateral discussions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Donald Trump, where they addressed global concerns that Trump described as a ""little crazy"". The meeting, held at the Élysée Palace, focused on global affairs which Trump described as “a little crazy right now.”At the French presidential palace, Trump received full military honours despite not being in office yet.

This meeting held particular significance for Zelensky, considering apprehensions in Kyiv about Trump's stance on the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Meanwhile,the Paris visit provided Macron an opportunity to understand the potential direction of Trump's second presidency, commencing in January.This was Trump's first international engagement following his electoral victory. His delegation included key advisors Susie Wiles, Steve Witkoff, and Massad Boulos, with Tesla CEO Elon Musk expected to attend the Notre Dame ceremony.Despite previous tensions, Trump highlighted his positive relationship with the French leader, stating, ""We had a great relationship as everyone knows. We accomplished a lot.""On the other hand, Macron expressed gratitude for Trump's attendance at the Notre Dame reopening, recalling Trump's supportive response to the 2019 cathedral fire during his presidency.Their initial relationship in 2017 began positively, despite political differences, though it later deteriorated over disagreements regarding climate change, trade and defence matters.The discussions encompassed the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, alongside trade relations. Trump had earlier expressed views against US involvement in Syria, where rebels report advancing towards Damascus.Zelensky joined the meeting later, describing it as ""good and productive"" on social media, expressing hopes for a just conclusion to the conflict.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan ’s imprisoned ex-prime minister Imran Khan has threatened to launch a nationwide civil disobedience movement, in an apparent bid to keep his public mobilisation campaign intact and to force the country’s powerful authorities to agree to his demands.Less than two weeks after his “final call” protest in Islamabad was violently suppressed, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief has asked his supporters to converge on Dec 13 in the northwestern city of Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, to pay homage to party workers who were killed in the crackdown by security forces in Islamabad.His call for protest in Islamabad had mobilised thousands of supporters, primarily from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a province governed by his party. Imran’s party is believed to have organised the Dec 13 gathering in Peshawar keeping in mind his popularity in the region.Imran has also constituted a five-member team to discuss two key demands with govt: release of undertrial prisoners and a judicial probe into the crackdown on the Nov 26 protest march and the violence on May 9 last year. On both dates, PTI workers and Imran’s supporters held major protests, but faced a backlash from govt and security forces.“If these two demands are not accepted, a civil disobedience movement will begin on Dec 14. Govt will bear full responsibility for the consequences,” the PTI chief’s post in Urdu read.“As part of the movement, we will urge overseas Pakistanis to limit remittances and start a boycott campaign. In the second phase, we will escalate our actions further,” he added.The announcement followed Imran’s recent indictment for his involvement in an attack on military headquarters on May 9 last year, while he was also slapped with charges of terrorism for his role in protests that besieged Islamabad last month.Meanwhile, data submitted before the Islamabad high court revealed that the 72-year old cricketer-turned-politician is currently facing 188 criminal cases and inquiries.

Growing threat from Baloch separatists

Sectarian violence fuels instability

Border tensions and counterterrorism efforts

What lies ahead

Pakistan witnessed a sharp rise in terror attacks in November, with 61 incidents marking a 27% increase from the previous month, according to a report by the Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS). The number of fatalities also surged by 69%, climbing from 100 in October to 169, with 225 others injured.The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a banned group, carried out 12 attacks in November, including three high-impact incidents that resulted in 45 deaths. These figures surpassed the fatalities caused by the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), indicating a shift in the BLA's operational strategy. Experts suggest this escalation requires a reassessment of counterterrorism tactics.The majority of these attacks in Balochistan targeted security forces and civilians. Notable incidents included an assault on the Quetta railway station, an attack on a police van in Mastung, and a strike on a security check-post in Kalat, which collectively accounted for 91% of the province’s fatalities.Sectarian violence added another layer to the country's security challenges, particularly in the Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). Seven incidents, including two terror attacks and five sectarian clashes, claimed 115 lives and left 137 injured. The violence was triggered by an attack on passenger buses on November 21, which spiraled into broader sectarian unrest.KP remained the most affected province, with 41 terrorist attacks leading to 114 deaths and 95 injuries. The TTP, Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group, Lashkar-i-Islam, and other local factions were linked to most of these incidents.The report also highlighted six incidents of border violence along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, resulting in 25 terrorist deaths and 11 injuries. This underscores the ongoing instability in the region and the challenges posed by cross-border insurgents.Security forces conducted 19 counterterrorism operations in November, killing 53 terrorists. Most of these operations were concentrated in KP and Balochistan, the epicenters of recent violence.The PIPS report paints a grim picture of Pakistan's security landscape, with 98 conflict-related incidents causing 338 deaths and 411 injuries in November alone. Experts suggest that the evolving nature of terror threats, including the increasing lethality of BLA operations and persistent sectarian tensions, requires urgent and innovative policy responses.As Pakistan grapples with these challenges, the question remains: can the state adapt quickly enough to address the multifaceted threats destabilizing the country?","Pakistan witnessed a sharp rise in terror attacks in November, with 61 incidents marking a 27% increase from the previous month.

ISLAMABAD: A Pakistan anti-terrorism court indicted on Thursday former prime minister Imran Khan along with dozens of other Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) politicians on charges of inciting supporters to attack the country’s military installations on May 9, 2023.Following Khan’s arrest on May 9 last year, his supporters had attacked and torched several military buildings and offices to protest against what they describe as the illegal detention of their leader. At least eight people were killed in the violence that followed Khan’s arrest on alleged graft charges.Khan pleaded not guilty to the charges while the court also indicted more than 60 others, including opposition leader in the National Assembly Omar Ayub, in the same case linked to the attack on the army’s General Headquarters (GHQ) in the garrison city of Rawalpindi.

Arrest warrants were also issued for 45 absconding accused, with the court warning that legal proceedings would begin to declare them fugitives if they failed to appear.Judge Amjad Ali Shah conducted the hearing at a makeshift court set up in Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, where Khan has been incarcerated. Following the indictment, the court fixed Dec 10 as the date for recording prosecution’s evidence.Khan has been facing anti-terrorism charges in connection with the violence, which is viewed as the most serious challenge to the military’s dominance in Pakistan’s history.

Pak sectarian violence: Death toll rises to 130 as clashes continue in Kurram despite ceasefire,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pak-sectarian-violence-death-toll-rises-to-130-as-clashes-continue-in-kurram-despite-ceasefire/articleshow/115868783.cms,"PTI photo

PESHAWAR: The death toll from sectarian violence in Pakistan's restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province surged to 130, with at least six people killed and eight injured on Sunday, as clashes in the volatile Kurram district continued for the eleventh consecutive day.The clashes between Alizai and Bagan tribes in the district started on November 22, after an attack on a convoy of passenger vans near Parachinar in which 47 people were killed a day earlier. Several passengers who had sustained grave injuries succumbed later, raising the toll in the convoy killing to 57.Police said the situation remained tense, and violence persists despite a recent ceasefire agreement between the Sunni and Shia groups.The six new deaths reported on Sunday brought the death toll to 130, while the total number of injured rose to 186 after eight fresh injuries were reported.The 10-day truce brokered last week has been rendered ineffective by intermittent violence, which shows no signs of abating.A high-powered delegation, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Secretary Nadeem Aslam Chaudhry and IGP Akhtar Hayat Gandapur, had also negotiated a ceasefire last weekend, but violence resumed shortly afterwards.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi earlier planned to dispatch members of the grandpeace jirga (council of tribal leaders) from Kohat division to Kurram for engaging with leaders from both warring factions to negotiate peace.Addressing a gathering of political leaders and tribal elders in Kohat on Sunday, he called for strict action with public cooperation to make the region weapon-free through joint operations.He said he was ready to go to Kurram and stay there for as many days as the jirga suggested to ensure peace in the region.""No other country or province will resolve our issues. We must take responsibility for improving the situation ourselves,"" he said.Kundi announced an All-Parties Conference (APC) for peace and the province's rights and invited Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur to join it.The governor stressed the role of religious scholars in promoting peace, urging them to focus on unity.Several other leaders addressed the gathering, putting aside their ideological differences on other issues.The continued violence forced the closure of the main Peshawar-Parachinar Road for travel, and commuting at the Pak-Afghan Kharlachi border has also been suspended.The closure of the main arteries has created a scarcity of oil, food commodities and medicines in the region.The Kurram region is also experiencing a communication blackout, with mobile and internet services suspended and educational institutions closed.Police and other security forces personnel had been deployed in various parts of Lower Kurram, said Deputy Commissioner Javed Ullah Mehsud, adding that all-out efforts will be made for a truce in other areas today as well.""We are hopeful for progress on a ceasefire and reopening of transport routes,"" he stated.Previous efforts to mediate peace, including a seven-day truce brokered by provincial officials in November have failed to hold.","Death toll from sectarian violence in Pakistan's restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province surges to 130.
