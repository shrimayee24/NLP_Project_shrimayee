KOLKATA: A CBI lawyer kept a Kolkata court waiting 50 minutes for a hearing Friday on RG Kar hospital rape-murder suspect Sanjay Roy 's bail application , prompting the exasperated magistrate to wonder aloud at one point if she should accept the plea and let out the alleged perpetrator of the Aug 9 crime.""If the lawyer is not present, he (Roy) should be granted bail,"" additional chief judicial magistrate Pamela Gupta said on hearing from a CBI officer at 4.10pm that the public prosecutor was delayed.As the minutes ticked by and lawyer Dipak Poria still hadn't arrived, the magistrate asked the CBI officer to call him. ""It is 4.20pm now. This is very unfortunate,"" she said.The officer, who identified herself as an assistant investigating officer in the case, stepped out of the courtroom to make a call and returned after nearly 15 minutes to say that the lawyer was on his way.When Poria entered the courtroom at 5pm, defence lawyer Kavita Sarkar got up to question why CBI wasn't being represented by the counsel who attended the Aug 23 hearing.Poria replied that he was CBI's ""full-time lawyer"" and informed the court without citing any reason that the agency opposes Roy's bail plea. Magistrate Gupta remanded the rape-murder suspect, the lone person named in the FIR, in judicial custody till Sept 20.Defence lawyer Sarkar had argued for bail to Roy on the ground that he didn't have criminal antecedents or a criminal case pending against him. She also mentioned that CBI was still to reveal the evidence against him, while the prosecution was ""reluctant"" and ""lethargic"" to argue in court.""Roy should be granted bail for these reasons,"" Sarkar said.CBI's second remand plea since the agency was handed the probe by Calcutta HC reiterates that Roy, who used to be a civilian traffic police volunteer, remains the only suspect in the rape-murder of a 31-year-old junior doctor.TOI had reported on Aug 23 that CBI's first remand note in a Sealdah court seeking Roy's judicial custody does not mention ""gang rape"", although the victim's family suspects she was assaulted by more than one person.""The relevant DNA report has been sent to AIIMS (Delhi) for an opinion,"" a CBI officer said later. ""We have not concluded anything so far. The samples were collected by police and later given to us. The victim was cremated before we took over the probe and we don't have any option but to depend on what police gave us.""CBI has questioned over 100 people and conducted over 10 polygraph tests, including two on Sandip Ghosh , the arrested former principal of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital.",A CBI lawyer kept a Kolkata court waiting 50 minutes for a hearing Friday on rape-murder suspect Sanjay Roy's bail application.

KOLKATA: She was working exceptionally hard, aiming for a gold medal in her specialty. Her parents expected her home very late on Aug 9 after a 36-hour shift. She did return at the expected hour, but in a hearse - supine, wrapped in a shroud.She was raped and murdered in the quiet of a seminar room where she had retired to read, reflect, and rest awhile after 16 hours of her marathon shift.The morning of August 8 began like any other for the 31-year-old postgraduate resident doctor, known for her punctuality.She arrived at the RG Kar Medical College and Hospital 's respiratory medicine department OPD around 10am, ready for a long shift. Having stayed in a hostel on campus, she had been commuting from her home, on the outskirts of Kolkata and about 14km north of RG Kar hospital, for over a year.Colleagues recalled her as being her usual busy, focused self, with nothing out of the ordinary. ""The OPD was bustling with patients when she entered the hospital and got busy right away. She admitted six patients and had no time for a break except to snatch a few moments to have some tea,"" said a colleague.Assigned to unit 2A of the department, her team in the OPD included a resident medical officer, a senior resident doctor, a faculty member, as well as interns and house staff. Housed in room 204 of the OPD building, it was her workstation until 3pm.After that, she joined her team in the ward. Her team had ordered lunch, and since she was late, they kept her food aside.""She came in after 3pm and had her food in the 'sleep room' next door where we usually eat. She was a little reserved but very focused. A senior faculty member and I left around 4.30pm after telling her to call if any patient's condition deteriorated. The call never came and the next morning I learned of her gruesome death,"" said a third-year trainee doctor.After a late lunch, she hurried to take charge of patients in her unit. The 80-bed department on the third floor of the Emergency Building has six units, and this was to be her place of work until another PG trainee doctor relieved her late on Aug 9.""Didi was dashing to the ward when I bumped into her in the corridor. We exchanged pleasantries and she said she had a lot of work in the ward,"" said a first-year PG doctor. Both passed by one of the seminar hall doors.Once in the ward, she diligently checked her patients, reviewed their treatment papers, and coordinated with the nurses on their medications. Although she had a third-year PG doctor guiding her during the day, she took charge of her unit - comprising two first-year PG doctors, an intern, and a house staff - at night, as was the practice.""Whatever little interaction we had with her, she would always encourage us to aim for perfection,"" said a junior.Colleagues noted she took a break around midnight for dinner, then returned to the ward to do a round before heading to the seminar hall to rest around 2am on Aug 9 - 16 hours since she reached the hospital. That shuteye turned out to be her last, and her colleagues shuddered at the thought of how brutal it was.","The 31-year-old postgraduate resident doctor was known for her punctuality.

NEW DELHI: Manipur CM N Biren Singh called an emergency cabinet meeting on Saturday following a week of renewed violence in the state.Earlier, at least five people were killed in a gun battle between groups belonging to two communities in Manipur's Jiribam district. A security source said that several others were injured and the number of casualty can rise.On Friday, suspected militants launched rocket attacks at the residence of Manipur's first chief minister Mairembam Koireng, killing one and injuring six others.Security forces in response destroyed three bunkers in the neighboring Churachandpur district and aerial patrolling was conducted using a military helicopter.Additionally, the spokesperson of the Coordinating Committee on Manipur Integrity (COCOMI), Khuraijam Athouba, declared an indefinite public emergency citing increased Kuki aggression in the region.""The escalation of Kuki aggression has increased double-fold again. Over the past few days there were several incidents of drone bombing in Imphal West, killing several people and injuring many others, and today again there have been two missile attacks, which have been shot from a very long range around 7 kilometres.

In the aftermath of the tragic Apalachee High School shooting , the grandfather of suspect Colt Gray has spoken publicly about the family's troubled past and the devastating consequences of the environment in which his grandson was raised.According to Channel 2 Action News reports, Charlie Polhamus expressed sorrow for the events that unfolded, while emphasizing the difficult circumstances surrounding Colt Gray’s upbringing.“I’m not discounting what my grandson did. It was awful. And he needs to pay a price for it,” Polhamus was quoted as saying. “He was driven to do what he did by the environment that he lived in.”The 16-year-old Colt Gray faces four counts of felony murder following the shooting that claimed the lives of four people and injured nine others. His father, Colin Gray, was also arrested and charged with second-degree murder, involuntary manslaughter, and cruelty to children.Both father and son appeared in Barrow County court for preliminary hearings on Friday. While Colt Gray, as a minor, is exempt from the death penalty, he could face life imprisonment. Colin Gray’s potential sentence could reach 180 years if convicted.District Attorney Brad Smith addressed the media after the hearings, underscoring the rarity of a parent being charged in connection with a school shooting. “This may be the first case in Georgia, and the second in the country, where a parent faces charges like this,” Smith said.Polhamus, struggling with the weight of the situation, added, “He deserves what he gets. The one thing I’m telling you is he wasn’t born to do that. He’s a victim of his environment. That’s as plain as I can put it.”Prosecutors plan to present both cases before a grand jury on October 17.","The 16-year-old Colt Gray faces four counts of felony murder following the shooting that claimed the lives of four people and injured nine others.

Amid speculations that Prince Harry is desperate to return to the UK and has sent feelers to his old aides to plan a possible comeback for him, the first reaction of the Royal Family is now known.

The Iranian regime is accused of enlisting criminals, including drug lords, to carry out its operations.Abdelkrim S, who had previously served a 10-year sentence for a killing in Marseille, was released on probation in July 2023.

His wife, Sabrina B, reportedly accompanied him on these trips.Abdelkrim S denies any involvement in terrorism, claiming that his travels to Germany were purely for shopping. French authorities have also linked the cell to several arson attempts on Israeli-owned companies in southern France between December 2023 and January 2024. These attacks were reportedly intended to intimidate Jewish communities.Despite the mounting evidence, Abdelkrim S has rejected the claims.

Father’s influence and firearm access

Family Tensions and legal issues

A 14-year-old Georgia teenager, Colt Gray , and his father, Colin Gray , 54, have been charged in the fatal shooting at Apalachee High School in Barrow County, Georgia, which claimed the lives of two students and two teachers. Nine others were injured, with seven suffering gunshot wounds. The shooting has drawn attention to Colt’s troubled home life, his family’s instability, and the role of his father.Colt’s upbringing was marked by instability, moving between several rental homes in a short period of time.His parents’ divorce in May 2022 further contributed to this turmoil. Following the separation, Colt lived with his father while his two younger siblings moved in with their mother, Marcee Gray. According to court documents obtained by Fox News Digital, the family had been evicted from a rental property in Jefferson, Georgia, in 2022. They later lived in another rental home in the same town before relocating again.Neighbors told Fox News Digital that the Grays stayed in their Jefferson home for only “a couple of months.” These frequent relocations and family disruptions left Colt struggling to find stability.Police interview transcripts from 2023 reveal that Colt experienced significant bullying at school. According to his father, the teen was ""picked on and ridiculed"" by classmates at West Jackson Middle School before transferring to Jefferson Middle School, where the situation slightly improved.In the interview, Colin Gray explained how his son was mocked for trying to join the school’s golf team. He recalled, “I was trying to get him on the golf team … like, ‘Oh look, Colt’s gay. He’s dating that guy.’ Just ridiculed him day after day after day.” The constant bullying left Colt isolated and emotionally distressed. Despite the challenges, his father tried to encourage him to engage in outdoor activities, such as hunting, to cope with the situation.In May 2023, police investigated Colt after he allegedly made threats to shoot up his middle school. During a police interview, Colin Gray denied knowledge of the threats but admitted that both he and his son spent time shooting and hunting. Colin described these activities as bonding experiences, even showing investigators a photo of Colt after shooting his first deer.Despite these reassurances, authorities discovered that Colin had provided Colt with a semiautomatic AR-15-style rifle, the same weapon used in the Apalachee High School shooting. Colin Gray is now facing second-degree murder charges for giving the firearm to his son, despite knowing that Colt posed a threat to himself and others.The family dynamic worsened in November 2023 when Colt’s mother, Marcee Gray, was arrested for vandalizing her ex-husband’s truck in a violent outburst. Court documents revealed that police found methamphetamine, fentanyl, and other illegal substances in her vehicle during her arrest. She was later prosecuted under Georgia’s First Offender Act, serving 46 days in jail and receiving probation for five years.Under the conditions of her probation, Marcee was prohibited from contacting Colin Gray directly, with any communication regarding their children to be made through a third party.Both Colt and his father now face serious charges for their involvement in the Apalachee High School shooting. The case highlights the impact of Colt’s unstable home life, ongoing bullying, and family tension. The father and son appeared in court for the first time in September 2023, where their attorneys declined to seek immediate bail.","Colt Gray, 14, and his father, Colin Gray, 54, have been charged in the fatal shooting at Apalachee High School in Barrow County, Georgia.

The White House has been warning Iran for months not to transfer ballistic missiles to Russia.""Any transfer of Iranian ballistic missiles to Russia would represent a dramatic escalation in Iran's support for Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine and lead to the killing of more Ukrainian civilians,"" National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett said in a statement. ""This partnership threatens European security and illustrates how Iran's destabilizing influence reaches beyond the Middle East and around the world.""The US finding comes as the Kremlin tries to repel Ukraine's surprise offensive that has led to the seizure of about 500 square miles (1,300 kilometers) of Russia's Kursk region. Meanwhile, Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is pressing allies to allow his country to use Western-supplied missiles to strike deep inside Russia and hit sites from which Moscow launches aerial attacks.Iran, as it has with previous US intelligence findings, denied providing Russia with weapons for its war in Ukraine.""Iran considers the provision of military assistance to the parties engaged in the conflict - which leads to increased human casualties, destruction of infrastructure, and a distancing from ceasefire negotiations - to be inhumane,"" according to a statement from Iran's mission to the United Nations. ""Thus, not only does Iran abstain from engaging in such actions itself, but it also calls upon other countries to cease the supply of weapons to the sides involved in the conflict.""CIA Director William Burns, who was in London on Saturday for a joint appearance with his British intelligence counterpart, warned of the growing and ""troubling"" defense relationship involving Russia, China, Iran and North Korea that he said threatens both Ukraine and Western allies in the Middle East.The White House has repeatedly declassified and publicized intelligence findings that show North Korea has sent ammunition and missiles to Russia to use against Ukraine, while Iran supplies Moscow with attack drones and has assisted the Kremlin with building a drone-manufacturing factory.China has held back from providing Russians with weaponry but has surged sales to Russia of machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that Moscow in turn is using to produce missiles, tanks, aircraft and other weaponry, according to US officials.The White House has been on edge for months about a possible deal between Iran and Russia.The Democratic administration said in January that US intelligence officials had determined a Russian-Iran deal had not been completed, but officials were concerned that Russia's negotiations to acquire missiles from Iran were actively advancing.Last September, according to the White House, Iran hosted a top Russian defense official to show off a range of ballistic missile systems, adding to the US concern that a deal could come together.The US and other countries have taken steps aimed at thwarting the supply, sale or transfer involving Iran and ballistic missile-related items, including issuing guidance to private companies about Iranian missile procurement practices to make sure those companies are not inadvertently supporting Iran's development efforts.President Joe Biden is set to host British Prime Minister Keir Starmer for talks at the White House on Friday. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said ""continuing robust support to Ukraine in its defense against Russian aggression"" will be on their agenda.","The White House has been warning Iran for months not to transfer ballistic missiles to Russia.

A tragic outcome

Marcee Gray , a former engineer from Fitzgerald, Georgia , has been thrust into the spotlight following the tragic shooting at Apalachee High School in Winder, Georgia. Her son, Colt Gray , 14, has been charged with the murder of four people in the incident.Marcee Gray’s professional life seemed to be on an upward trajectory.She reportedly earned a Bachelor’s degree in Industrial Management from Georgia Southern University in 2005 and a Master’s degree in Occupational Safety and Health from Columbia Southern University in 2008. Her career included notable positions such as Quality Engineering Supervisor at Toyota Industries, North America, and Quality Manager at Olympic Steel.However, her career was cut short in 2021, with her LinkedIn profile showing her final roles as Quality Assurance Manager at Georgia Pacific LLC and Senior Quality Engineer at PCC Airfoils, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.Marcee's personal life, however, tells a starkly different story. Arrested in 2023 on charges related to drug possession, trafficking, and vehicle theft, her criminal record reveals a history of drug abuse and domestic violence, reported the New York Post. According to her sister, Annie Polhamus Brown, Marcee's addiction and subsequent actions have deeply affected their family. “Marcee destroyed our family with her drug addiction,” Polhamus Brown said in social media posts.Marcee’s tumultuous relationship with her husband, Colin Gray, was marked by allegations of abuse. Marcee herself detailed the abusive nature of her marriage in social media posts, explaining why she stayed for 14 years: “I made a commitment to the Lord and my husband. No one but me understands the pain that my husband lives with every single day,” she wrote.Neighbors and family members paint a grim picture of Colt’s upbringing, reported the New York Post. Lauren Vickers, a neighbor, described frequent disturbances and neglect: “There were nights where the mom would lock him and his sister out the house… It was constant abuse.” Charles Polhamus, Colt’s maternal grandfather, described Colt as “a good kid” in a “hostile” environment, suffering from the abuse he and his mother endured.Investigations are now focusing on the family's interactions with child protective services. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation is looking into Colt’s mental health struggles and his family’s failure to address them adequately.The situation worsened when Colin Gray, who works in construction, reportedly bought Colt an AR-15 rifle for Christmas. Colin has been charged with multiple counts, including involuntary manslaughter and cruelty to children. The GBI’s Chris Hosey emphasized that these charges stem from Colin’s decision to allow Colt to possess the weapon.Annie Brown expressed frustration at the adults who failed to help Colt, saying, “The adults around him failed him.”Colt Gray has been charged as an adult with four counts of murder following the Apalachee High School shooting.

The attack was planned to mark the first anniversary of the October 7 attack on Israel from Hamas.Muhammad Shahzeb Khan, 20, also known as Shahzeb Jadoon, was nabbed in or around Ormstown, Canada, which is about 12 miles from the US border, the Justice Department said.The US government said it will seek to extradite him from Canada.“The defendant is alleged to have planned a terrorist attack in New York City around October 7th of this year with the stated goal of slaughtering, in the name of ISIS , as many Jewish people as possible,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement.“Jewish communities — like all communities in this country — should not have to fear that they will be targeted by a hate-fueled terrorist attack,” he added.According to the officials, Khan had planned to attack a Jewish center in Brooklyn in support of the Islamic State group, or ISIS. He was also considering carrying out a shooting on Oct. 11, which is Yom Kippur, the holiest day in Judaism.According to the complaint, Khan attempted to travel from Canada to New York City, where he intended to use automatic and semi-automatic weapons to carry out a mass shooting in support of the IS at a Jewish centre in Brooklyn, New York.Khan began posting on social media and communicating with others on an encrypted messaging application about his support for the IS in or about November last year when, among other things, Khan distributed IS propaganda videos and literature.""If we succeed with our plan, this would be the largest attack on US soil since 9/11,"" he said in one of the messages.As part of his plan, Khan attempted to reach the US-Canada border around September 4th.

Presidential debate: Trump campaigns while Harris prepares – what to know and when to watch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/presidential-debate-trump-campaigns-while-harris-prepares-what-to-know-and-when-to-watch/articleshow/113159635.cms,"Harris preps, trump hits the trail

The debate will follow these agreed-upon rules:

As the presidential debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris draws closer, the stark differences in their preparation methods are becoming clear. Trump, the Republican nominee, has been holding rallies and dismissing the importance of debate prep, while Vice President Harris is intensely focused on crafting her responses during a weekend of debate preparation in Pennsylvania.Both candidates are vying for voter attention in crucial swing states, with Harris in Pennsylvania and Trump in Wisconsin.The polls show a tight race, making this upcoming debate a pivotal moment.While Harris hunkers down with her team to fine-tune her responses for the debate, Trump continues his campaign stops, relying on his instincts rather than structured preparation. He remarked during a town hall with Fox News host Sean Hannity, “You can go in with all the strategy you want, but you have to feel it out as the debate's taking place.”In contrast, Harris has been working closely with Democratic consultants to sharpen her message against Trump, focusing on issues like the economy, abortion, and law enforcement. She has repeatedly emphasized that Trump’s disregard for the truth will be evident during the debate.The ABC News debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris is set for Tuesday, Sept. 10, at 9 p.m. Eastern Time. Taking place at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, the 90-minute event will be moderated by a panel of ABC journalists.- The debate will last 90 minutes with two commercial breaks.- Only the two seated moderators will ask questions.- A virtual coin toss held on Sept. 3 determined podium placement and the order of closing statements. Former President Donald Trump won the toss and chose to give the final closing statement, while Vice President Kamala Harris selected the right podium (stage left).- Candidates will be introduced by the moderators and will enter from opposite sides of the stage, with the incumbent party introduced first.- There will be no opening statements, and each candidate will have two minutes for closing remarks.- Candidates will stand behind podiums throughout the debate, and props or prewritten notes are not allowed on stage.- No topics or questions will be shared in advance with the candidates.- Each candidate will have a pen, pad of paper, and a bottle of water onstage.- Candidates will be given two minutes for answers, two minutes for rebuttals, and an additional minute for follow-ups or clarifications.- Microphones will only be live for the candidate speaking and muted when it is the other candidate's turn.- Candidates will not be allowed to ask each other questions.- Campaign staff cannot interact with the candidates during commercial breaks.- Moderators will enforce time limits and ensure a civil discussion.- The debate will take place without a live audience.","The ABC News debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris is set for Tuesday, Sept. 10, at 9 p.m. Eastern Time.

Former President Donald Trump held a rally at Central Wisconsin Airport, addressing his familiar grievances about his legal battles and attacks on the Biden-Harris administration.

Trump’s accusations came shortly after his court appearance related to a sexual abuse case appeal.""To every citizen who is sick and tired of the parasitic political class in Washington that sucks our country of its blood and treasure, November 5th will be your new liberation day"" Trump said.During the rally, Trump also criticized Vice President Kamala Harris , warning that her re-election would result in a ""Banana Republic"" and condemned the Biden administration's immigration policies, calling them ""suicidal.""""We will completely overhaul Kamala’s corrupt department of injustice and turn the Justice Department back into the best law enforcement agency on the planet. Instead of persecuting Republicans, they will focus on taking down bloodthirsty cartels, transnational gangs, and Radical Islamic Terrorists,"" Trump said.In his speech, Trump continued to question the integrity of US elections, encouraging attendees to verify their voter registration and vote in large numbers to counteract alleged voter fraud, despite no substantial evidence supporting these claims.As Trump rallied his supporters, the Harris campaign shared key moments from his speech, highlighting his controversial remarks. The campaign shared clips of Trump announcing his plans to pardon January 6 rioters on his first day in office and reaffirming his commitment to the Project 2025 plan, which includes eliminating the Department of Education and building mass detention camps for migrants.","Former President Donald Trump held a rally at Central Wisconsin Airport, addressing his familiar grievances about his legal battles and attacks on the Biden-Harris administration.

""I'm going to be mad as hell if he did, and then all the guns will go away.""Now both Colt, 14, and Colin Gray, 54, are charged in the killings of two students and two teachers Wednesday at Apalachee High School in Barrow County, outside Atlanta. Nine others were hurt, seven of them shot. The Grays appeared Friday for the first time in court, where their attorneys declined to immediately seek bail.The teen is charged with murder, and his father is accused of second-degree murder for providing his son with a semiautomatic, AR 15-style rifle used to kill children. Arrest warrants say the elder Gray did so knowing his son ""was a threat to himself and others.""Jackson County authorities ended their inquiry into Colt Gray a year ago, concluding that there wasn't clear evidence to link him to a threat posted on Discord, a social media site popular with video gamers. The records from that investigation provide at least a narrow glimpse into a boy who struggled with his parents' breakup and at the middle school he attended at the time, where his father said others frequently taunted him.""He gets flustered and under pressure. He doesn't really think straight,"" Colin Gray told the investigator on May 21, 2023, recalling a discussion he'd had with the boy's principal.Shooting guns and hunting, he said, were frequent pastimes for father and son. Gray said he was encouraging the boy to be more active outdoors and spend less time playing video games on his Xbox.When Colt Gray killed a deer months earlier, his father swelled with pride. He showed the investigator a photo on his cellphone, saying: ""You see him with blood on his cheeks from shooting his first deer.""""It was just the greatest day ever,"" Colin Gray said.There's no mention in the investigator's report and interview transcript of either Gray owning an assault-style rifle. Asked if his son had access to firearms, the father said yes.But he said the guns weren't kept loaded and insisted he had emphasized safety when teaching the boy to shoot.""He knows the seriousness of weapons and what they can do,"" Gray said, ""and how to use them and not use them.""An eviction upended the Grays' family in summer 2022.On July 25 of that year, a sheriff's deputy was dispatched to the rental home on a suburban cul-de-sac where Colin Gray, his wife, Colt and the boy's two younger siblings lived. A moving crew was piling their belongings in the yard.The Jackson County deputy said in a report that the movers found guns and hunting bows in a closet in the master bedroom. They turned the weapons and ammunition over to the deputy for safekeeping, rather than leave them outside with the family's other possessions outside.The deputy wrote that he left copies of receipt forms for the weapons on the front door so that Gray could pick them up later at the sheriff's office.The reason for eviction is not mentioned in the report. Colin Gray told the investigator in 2023 that he had paid his rent.It was following the eviction, he said, that his wife left him, taking the two younger siblings with her.Colt Gray ""struggled at first with the separation and all,"" said the father, who worked a construction job.""I'm the sole provider, doing high rises downtown,"" he told the investigator. Two days later, there was a follow-up interview with Colin Gray while he was at work. He said by phone: ""I'm hanging off the top of a building. ... I've got a big crane lift going, so it's kind of noisy up here.""Middle school had also been rough for Colt Gray. He had just finished the seventh grade when Miller interviewed the father and son.Colin Gray said the boy had just a few friends and frequently got picked on. Some students ""just ridiculed him day after day after day.""""I don't want him to fight anybody, but they just keep like pinching him and touching him,"" Gray said. ""Words are one thing, but you start touching him and that's a whole different deal. And it's just escalated to the point where like his finals were last week and that was the last thing on his mind.""The investigator also interviewed the boy, then 13, who was described in a report as quiet, calm and reserved.He denied making any threats and said that months earlier he'd stopped using the Discord platform, where the school threat was posted. He later told his father his account had been hacked.""The only thing I have is TikTok, but I just go on there and watch videos,"" the teen said.A year before they would both end up charged in the high school shooting, Colin Gray insisted to the sheriff's investigator that his son wasn't the type to threaten violence.""He's not a loner, Officer Miller. Don't get that,"" the father said, adding: ""He just wants to go to school, do his own thing and he doesn't want any trouble.""","Colt Gray, 14, and his father, Colin, 54, are charged in the killings of two students and two teachers.

On both occasions, the military had publicly denied direct involvement, saying indigenous Kashmiri rebels were fighting Indian forces.In 1999, however, thousands of paramilitary Northern Light Infantry regulars, drawn exclusively from Gilgit-Baltistan and skilled in high-altitude combat, were sent to occupy military posts that Indian troops would vacate in the snowy months.They established positions on the heights and commanded a view of the Srinagar-Leh highway, a major supply route for Indian troops stationed on the Siachen glacier.When India detected the incursion in early May 1999, Pakistan had claimed they were Kashmiri militants fighting Indian rule.According to observers, Pakistan had sent troops to Kargil to cut Indian supplies to Siachen, inflict heavy losses on Indian troops and pressure them into negotiating a settlement of the Kashmir dispute on Pakistani terms. Since Islamabad had conducted nuclear tests a year earlier, Pakistani generals were expecting a muted response from India.But the Indians hit back hard, sending infantry backed by artillery and air support. By mid-June the Pakistani positions on the hills began to fall. There were also international calls for Pakistan to withdraw its forces. Evidence suggested the Pakistani military leadership had not shared details of the Kargil operation with the govt of then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif . On July 4, Sharif was forced to announce a unilateral ceasefire. His govt was toppled in a military coup two months later.India had reconquered the Kargil heights by July 26. It lost more than 500 troops in the war, while estimates of Pakistani losses range from 400 to about 4,000. Thousands of people made homeless by the war are displaced in Pakistan to this day.","Pakistan's military had attempted on at least two occasions to send its forces into Kashmir to start a rebellion against Indian rule.

NEW DELHI: In a first, Pakistan army chief General Asim Munir publicly acknowledged the military's involvement in the Kargil War , during a recent defence day speech. Previous army chiefs and political leaders, such as Pervez Musharraf and Nawaz Sharif, have acknowledged Pakistan's involvement in the Kargil operation.According to several media reports, General Munir -- while addressing a ceremony at the General Headquarters in Rawalpindi to mark the country's 59th Defence Day, said: ""Be it 1948, 1965, 1971 or 1999 Kargil war, thousands of Shuhadas (martyrs) have sacrificed their life for the country and nation.""This marks the first time a serving army chief has openly admitted to the army's direct role in a conflict that has long been shrouded in denial and controversy in Pakistan.The audio of the video, which has been circulated widely online, has not been independently verified.For years, Pakistan's military and political leadership has maintained a narrative that distanced itself from the Kargil operations, often referring to the infiltrators as mere ""Kashmiri freedom fighters"".India has, however, repeatedly said that the operation was a calculated military strategy aimed at altering the Line of Control (LoC) and asserting Pakistan's claim over Kashmir.The Kargil War was characterised by its high-altitude combat and brutal conditions, taking place in one of the most challenging terrains on Earth.The Pakistani military's strategy involved infiltrating troops disguised as militants into Indian territory, occupying strategic heights that overlooked key supply routes.The operation was intended to disrupt Indian logistics and draw international attention to the Kashmir issue, thereby internationalising the longstanding conflict.In strong retaliation to the Pakistan 'infiltrators', between mid-May and July 1999, the Indian Armed Forces gradually recaptured critical positions from the Pakistani infiltrators. The Kargil War officially concluded on July 26, 1999, when the Army announced the complete eviction of Pakistani forces from Indian soil.Over two months, intense battles took place in the challenging mountainous terrain. The Indian Army, as part of Operation Vijay, managed to drive out Pakistani intruders and successfully recaptured Tiger Hill and other strategic positions.","Pakistan army chief publicly acknowledged the military's involvement in the Kargil War.

Justice Asim Hafiz, who delivered the verdict, noted that the process was illegal.""Lest anyone misunderstand this, we make it clear that the appointment to any post under the government can only be made after a proper advertisement has been made, inviting applications from eligible candidates. Without holding a proper selection where all eligible candidates get a fair chance to compete would violate the guarantee enshrined under Articles 18 and 27 of the Constitution,"" Hafiz said.""I am afraid that illegality committed by way of an unauthorized appointment, one cannot hide the elephant in a mouse-hole,"" the judge added.The ruling is considered unusual given the powerful role the Pakistan army has traditionally played in the country, including periods of military rule in its more than 75 years of existence.Experts say the high court's decision might be seen as a setback for those who support the current regime, as the military often seeks to place its personnel in major civil positions.",Afsar became the first serving military officer to head Nadra in October 2023.

Court martial initiated against ex-ISI chief Faiz Hameed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/court-martial-initiated-against-ex-isi-chief-faiz-hameed/articleshow/113104543.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistani army said Thursday that court martial proceedings against former ISI chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (retd) were initiated in the wake of several charges that he violated the Pakistan Army Act .Rumours have been swirling in Islamabad these days that Hameed’s arrest last month could pave the way for a possible military trial of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan over charges of treason and attempting to incite mutiny in the army.The allegations are linked to cases which were filed after Imran's supporters went on a rampage last year following his arrest.Hameed was arrested over charges of graft, misuse of authority and violating the Pakistan Army Act. His arrest, however, has been seen by the opposition as a ploy to implicate Imran in cases linked to May 9 riots. This apprehension had prompted Khan to approach the Islamabad high court on Tuesday, pleading to stop civilian authorities from handing him over to the military. “A few weeks ago, a retired senior army officer (Faiz Hameed) was taken into military custody. It has been widely speculated and reported in the media that he will be made an approver against the petitioner (Imran Khan) in cases pertaining to May 9 and 10, 2023 and the petitioner will be transferred to military custody on this basis,” the petition read.Govt officials have repeatedly said Hameed worked with Khan to plan the riots.Addressing a press conference in Rawalpindi, army’s spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said the law takes its own course if a person from the Pakistani army works for personal gain or promotes a specific agenda.“The case of Gen Hameed is a clear example that the army takes violations of its rules very seriously. He (Hameed) had overstepped his legal and constitutional boundaries at the behest of certain political elements,” Chaudhary said.He said Gen Hameed’s case was referred to the Pakistani army through the defence ministry in light of a “full belief in the army’s accountability process”, following which the army ordered a “high-level court of inquiry” into the matter.“There is a clear consensus within the army that it is a national, state-owned institution, which must be prevented from being used against the completion of goals related to specific political agendas.”Khan is being currently tried in a civil court for allegedly abetting the violence on May 9, 2023, a charge he has denied.",Court martial proceedings against former ISI chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (retd) were initiated. Allegations are linked to cases filed after Imran's supporters went on a rampage last year following his arrest.

It mentioned that no documentation or order has been attached to the petition. The registrar's office asked how the petitions can be filed in the Islamabad high court when cases have been filed in Punjab.Furthermore, the IHC registrar's office questioned how the petition can be filed in a high court while the matter of military trials is subjudice in the supreme court , according to a Geo News report.Speaking to reporters, Imran Khan's lawyer, Intezar Panjutha said that they talked to the PTI founder regarding his plea in the IHC.
