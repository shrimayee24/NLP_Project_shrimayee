China military drills: 'Strong punishment': China conducts biggest ‘blockade’ drills around Taiwan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/strong-punishment-china-conducts-biggest-blockade-drills-around-taiwan/articleshow/110348456.cms,"The drills are being conducted in the Taiwan Strait, the north, south and east of Taiwan. (Representative image)

Why is

China conducting military drills around Taiwan

?

China's military drills are a direct response to what it perceives as ""separatist acts"" by Taiwan, particularly following the inauguration of Lai Ching-te as Taiwan's new president. Beijing views Lai's pro-independence stance as a threat to its claim over Taiwan, which it considers a part of its territory. The exercises are intended as a ""strong punishment"" and a ""stern warning"" against both Taiwanese independence forces and external forces supporting Taiwan.

What do these military drills involve?

The drills include joint sea-air combat-readiness patrols, precision strikes on key targets, and integrated operations around Taiwan and its outlying islands such as Kinmen, Matsu, Wuqiu, and Dongyin. The exercises involve multiple branches of the Chinese military, including the army, navy, air force, and rocket force. The objective is to test and showcase the actual joint combat capabilities of the forces.

Song Zhongping, a mainland military commentator and former PLA instructor, told the South China Morning Post that the PLA is utilizing the drills to rehearse a “blockade” of Taiwan. “It is a warning to Lai,” Song mentioned. “It is not the first time the PLA did so, but this time it is more severe,” he added.

How has Taiwan responded to these drills?

Taiwan has mobilized its sea, air, and ground forces in response to the drills. The ministry of national defence condemned the exercises, calling them ""irrational provocations"" that threaten regional peace and stability. Taiwan assured its citizens that it is prepared to defend its freedom, democracy, and sovereignty. A senior Taiwanese official noted that the government has a ""comprehensive grasp"" of Chinese military movements and had anticipated this scenario.

Have there been similar drills in the past?

Yes, China has conducted similar military drills in the past, often triggered by interactions between Taiwan and the United States. For instance, in August 2022, China launched extensive military exercises around Taiwan following a visit by then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. These exercises are part of a pattern where Beijing responds to what it sees as challenges to its sovereignty over Taiwan with displays of military might.

What are the political implications of these drills for Taiwan's new president, Lai Ching-te?

The drills increase pressure on President Lai, who has taken a strong pro-independence stance. His inauguration speech, which emphasized Taiwan's sovereignty and democratic values, was seen by Beijing as a direct challenge. Lai's leadership now faces the dual challenge of managing Taiwan's defense and navigating the heightened political and military tensions with China. Additionally, domestic opposition lawmakers are pushing for changes to Taiwan's laws that could limit the powers of the new government, further complicating Lai's position.

What has been the international reaction to these events?

There is significant international concern over the stability of the Taiwan Strait, a critical maritime trade route and a key player in the global tech industry, particularly in semiconductor manufacturing. Countries around the world have urged restraint and dialogue to resolve the tensions peacefully. The drills have also sparked fears of a potential invasion or heightened military conflict in the region.

China has started its biggest military exercise in a year around Taiwan in response to the inauguration of Taiwan's new president, Lai Ching-te . The drills, which Beijing describes as ""strong punishment"" for Taiwan's ""separatist acts,"" involve coordinated operations between the army, navy, air force, and rocket force. The exercises come after Lai's inauguration speech, which China condemned as a ""confession of independence."" These drills, focusing on joint sea-air combat-readiness and precision strikes, are seen as a demonstration of China's readiness to assert its claim over Taiwan, which it considers a breakaway province.The Taiwanese government has reacted strongly to these maneuvers. Taiwan's ministry of national defence has dispatched its sea, air, and ground forces to respond to the threat, condemning China's actions as ""irrational provocations"" that undermine regional stability. Despite the heightened tensions, Taiwan's stock market showed resilience, with a slight increase in the benchmark index. Internationally, there is widespread concern over the stability of the Taiwan Strait, a crucial maritime trade route and a hub for semiconductor manufacturing.Here is all you need to know about these military drills:(With inputs from agencies)","China's military drills are a direct response to what it perceives as ""separatist acts"" by Taiwan.

NEW DELHI: After being marred by weeks of pro-Palestine protests by students in US universities , hundreds of students adorning graduation robes walked out of Harvard commencement ceremony chanting ""free, free Palestine"" on Thursday.This came a day after the university announced that 13 students would not get their diploma as they participated in pro-Palestine protests. Expressing support for their counterparts, students chanted “Let them walk, let them walk”, urging the authority to allow those 13 students to receive their diplomas.The decision by Harvard's senior governing board comes after faculty members recommended on Monday that the 13 students be allowed to graduate despite their participation in the encampment. However, Harvard said that each of the 13 students had broken university policies by their actions during the encampment protest.“In coming to this determination, we note that the express provisions of the Harvard College Student Handbook state that students who are not in good standing are not eligible for degrees,” it said in a written statement.Expressing disappointment over the way university handled the protestors, student speaker Shruthi Kumar said “this semester our freedom of speech and our expressions of solidarity became punishable.”“I am deeply disappointed by the intolerance for freedom of speech and the right to civil disobedience on campus,” she said.“This is about civil rights and upholding democratic principles,” she said. “The students had spoken. The faculty had spoken. Harvard do you hear us?”, she added.Addressing the graduates at the ceremony, speaker Maria Ressa, a journalist and advocate for freedom of press said that “you don't know who you are until you're tested, until you fight for what you believe in. Because that defines who you are.”“The campus protests are testing everyone in America. Protests are healthy. They shouldn't be violent. They shouldn't be silenced,” she added.(With inputs from AP)","Hundreds of students walked out of Harvard commencement ceremony chanting ""free, free Palestine"" on Thursday.

NEW DELHI: The International Criminal Court (ICC) is pursuing arrest warrants for Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , Israel's defense minister Yoav Gallant, and two other top Hamas leaders, Mohammed Diab Ibrahim al-Masri (also known as Mohammed Deif) and Ismail Haniyeh, according to a statement released by ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan on Monday.The charges are related to the October 7 attacks on Israel and the subsequent war in Gaza, which Khan alleges constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity .The charges against Sinwar, Haniyeh, and al-Masri include ""extermination, murder, taking of hostages, rape and sexual assault in detention"", while the charges against Netanyahu and Gallant include ""causing extermination, causing starvation as a method of war, including the denial of humanitarian relief supplies, deliberately targeting civilians in conflict,"" said Khan in his statement.The ICC's decision to target Netanyahu marks the first time the court has sought an arrest warrant for the top leader of a close US ally, placing him in the same category as Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is also facing an ICC arrest warrant over the war in Ukraine.A panel of ICC judges will now consider Khan's application for the arrest warrants.Israel's top leaders slammed the development as a ""historical disgrace"".A furious Netanyahu lashed out at the ICC and the prosecutor, stating that the ""absurd"" move was ""exactly what new anti-Semitism looks like"".Vowing to bring down Hamas and achieve total victory, Netanyahu said Israel was fighting a ""just war"".Israel's foreign minister Israel Katz also hit out at the ICC chief prosecutor, stating: ""The Attorney General in the same breath mentions the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence of the State of Israel alongside the abominable Nazi monsters of Hamas -- a historical disgrace that will be remembered forever.""Israeli war cabinet minister Benny Gantz slammed the move which he said draws ""parallels between the leaders of a democratic country determined to defend itself from despicable terror to leaders of a blood-thirsty terror organisation (Hamas)"". ""It is a deep distortion of justice and blatant moral bankruptcy,"" he added.Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri also panned the ICC prosecutor's move, stating that the decision ""equates the victim with the executioner"" and encourages Israel to continue its ""war of extermination"" in Gaza.Wasel Abu Youssef, member of the Palestine Liberation Organization executive committee, said: ""The Palestinian people have the right to defend themselves ... The ICC is required to issue arrest warrants against Israeli officials who are pursuing crimes of genocide in the Gaza Strip.""When reports of the potential ICC action surfaced last month, Netanyahu called it ""an outrage of historic proportions"" and asserted that Israel has an independent legal system that thoroughly investigates all violations of the law. In response to Netanyahu's comments, Khan stated, ""Nobody is above the law,"" and advised Israel to raise a challenge before the court's judges if they disagree with the ICC's jurisdiction.Although Israel and the US are not members of the ICC, the court claims jurisdiction over Gaza, East Jerusalem, and the West Bank after Palestinian leaders formally agreed to be bound by the court's founding principles in 2015.The US also slammed the ICC prosecutor's move, stating that such a ""shameful"" decision puts ""truce talks at risk"".""We reject the prosecutor's equivalence of Israel with Hamas ... The ICC arrest decisions could jeopardise efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement, hostage deal and to increase humanitarian aid in Gaza,"" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.","ICC pursuing arrest warrants for Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel's defense minister Yoav Gallant. The charges are related to the October 7 attacks on Israel and the subsequent war in Gaza, which the ICC alleges constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity.

"More bad weather could hit Iowa, where 3 powerful tornadoes caused millions in damage",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/more-bad-weather-could-hit-iowa-where-3-powerful-tornadoes-caused-millions-in-damage/articleshow/110379345.cms,"GREENFIELD: For block after block through the small city of Greenfield , Iowa , the destructive power a tornado that ripped apart more than 100 homes in just one minute is evident in the muddy, shattered mess left behind. All along the mile-long swath Thursday was the deafening clamour of heavy equipment scooping up the splintered homes, smashed vehicles and shredded trees. But on either side of that path, picturesque houses and lawns seem untouched, and one might be hard-pressed to believe a twister packing peak winds of 175-185 mph (109-115 kph) had ravaged the community of 2,000, killing four people and injuring at least 35.More than 202 homes were destroyed by a series of tornadoes that raked the state on Tuesday, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said Thursday at a news conference. Most were in and around Greenfield. The count does not include businesses or other buildings destroyed or damaged, like Greenfield's 25-bed hospital.The havoc spun by the tornado now shows on the faces of people still processing how quickly homes and lives were shattered.Among those killed were Dean and Pam Wiggins, said their grandson Tom Wiggins.On Thursday, Tom Wiggins tried to find any of his grandparents' mementos that remained after the tornado demolished their home, leaving little more than its foundation. He described them as ""incredibly loved by not only our family but the entire town.""Not far away, Bill Yount, 64, also was cleaning up.""It's like somebody took a bomb,"" said Yount, gesturing to the land - covered with wood, debris , trees stripped of their leaves, heavy machinery and equipment to clean up the mess.Also surveying the damage was 80-year-old Edith Schaecher, who was briefly trapped in her collapsed house with her daughter until neighbors helped them out. They sought shelter in a basement concrete shower, holding pillows over their heads to protect from the falling debris.""It was over within probably 30 seconds,"" she said, destroying the home where she had lived for 47 years.Schaecher's neighbor, Joan Mitchell, was with her 57-year-old son in the home she'd lived in for 10 years when the tornado roared through.She had ignored the tornado warnings - until she was knocked to the floor and two recliners flew on top of her.""I kept praying and praying, and after that I started hollering, Help! Help! Help!'"" Mitchell recalled. Both she and her son survived with bumps and bruises.The governor praised the Federal Emergency Management Agency's response on Thursday as she sought a disaster declaration for multiple counties. After surveying Tuesday's destruction, the National Weather Service determined that three separate powerful tornados carved paths totaling 130 miles (209.21 kilometers) across Iowa, according to Donna Dubberke, the meteorologist in charge in Des Moines.Colton Newbury, 24, was working in Des Moines when the twister hit, nearly 60 miles (97 kilometers) away from his wife and 10-month-old daughter at their home in Greenfield.He rushed back only to find their home was ""a hole in the ground,"" he said. His wife hadn't heard the sirens. Newbury said his cousin ran out to get his wife and baby, and they rode out the tornado in the cousin's basement. The winds pulled entire homes away, he said: ""About every house on the block, just foundations left.""Still more severe weather was moving across the Midwest. The weather service's Storm Prediction Center shows an enhanced severe storm risk late Thursday into Friday morning for much of Nebraska and western Iowa, including areas where tornadoes hit Iowa and hurricane-force winds, large hail and torrential rain flooded streets and basements in Nebraska. Tornado warnings were issued Thursday evening for southwestern Oklahoma and in central Texas.This latest band of severe weather - including possible tornadoes - will hit Iowa ""when people are sleeping,"" warned National Weather Service meteorologist Andrew Ansorge of Des Moines.""Because of the damage already there, it won't take much wind to inflict even more damage on these homes,"" Ansorge said. ""It's just a bad deal all the way around.""More severe weather also could hit Saturday and Sunday in storm-damaged parts of Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas. An emergency was declared in Temple, Texas, after powerful storms ripped through the city of more than 90,000. Thousands lost power, Thursday's classes were canceled and nearby Fort Cavazos reported debris blocking traffic at the Army installation.The Greenfield twister is one of the strongest this year, which the National Weather Service identified Thursday as an EF4 - the second-most powerful ranking assigned to tornadoes.The year's deadliest tornado previously had been one that killed three people in Logan County, Ohio, on March 14. The Greenfield tornado set a new grim record as it obliterated homes and crumpled massive power-producing wind turbines outside the city.It was so destructive that it took authorities more than a day to account for the area's residents, and Iowa's Department of Public Safety said the number of injured is likely even higher. Officials haven't yet released the names of the Greenfield victims.A fifth person was killed Tuesday about 25 miles (40 kilometers) from Greenfield when her car was blown off the road in a tornado, according to the Adams County Sheriff's Office. Monica Zamarron, 46, died in the crash Tuesday afternoon, officials said.Reynolds has requested an expedited presidential disaster declaration for those Iowa counties that sustained significant damage. FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell joined her at the news conference in Greenfield and said that her agency will process the request as quickly as possible to get resources - which could include funding for temporary housing - to those left without homes.This is a historically busy tornado season in the US, in an era when climate change is heightening the severity of storms around the world. April had the country's second-highest number of tornadoes on record.Through Tuesday, 859 tornadoes had been confirmed this year, 27% more than the U.S. sees on average, according to NOAA's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. Iowa has recorded the most, with 81 confirmed twisters.","More than 202 homes were destroyed by a series of tornadoes that raked the state on Tuesday, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds says.

This will be the fourth installment of military aid for Ukraine since Congress passed a long-delayed foreign aid bill late last month and comes as the Biden administration has pledged to keep weapons flowing regularly and to get them to the front lines as quickly as possible.The package includes high mobility artillery rocket systems, or HIMARS, munitions as well 155 mm and 105 mm high-demand artillery rounds, according to the two US officials. Additional items in the aid package include Javelin and AT-4 anti-tank systems; anti-tank mines, tactical vehicles, small arms and ammunition for those weapons, one of the officials said. Both officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide details of the aid package before the public announcement.It follows a monthly gathering Monday of about 50 defense leaders from Europe and elsewhere who meet regularly to coordinate getting more military aid to Ukraine. At this latest meeting, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Ukraine was in a ""moment of challenge"" due to Russia's new onslaught on Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city. He pledged to keep weapons moving ""week after week.""Russia has sought to take advantage of Ukrainian shortages in manpower and weapons while the war-torn country waits for the arrival of more US assistance, which was delayed for months in Congress. Ukrainian forces have been pushed backward in places, while Russia has pounded its power grid and civilian areas.In the month since President Joe Biden signed the $95 billion foreign aid package, which included about $61 billion for Ukraine, the US has announced and started to send almost $1.7 billion in weapons pulled from Pentagon stockpiles.It's also announced $6 billion in funding through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative. That pays for longer-term contracts with the defense industry and means that the weapons could take many months or years to arrive.With this latest package, the US has now provided almost $51 billion in military assistance to Ukraine since Russia invaded in February 2022.","This will be the fourth installment of military aid for Ukraine since Congress passed a long-delayed foreign aid bill late last month.

Pakistan: Gang 'involved' in child abuse apprehended in Karachi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-gang-involved-in-child-abuse-apprehended-in-karachi/articleshow/110359022.cms,"KARACHI: In a significant development, Police in Karachi 's Orangi Town have dismantled a gang allegedly engaged in the sexual abuse of children, rescuing three minors in the process, according to Pakistan media outlet ARY News.The Superintendent of Police (SP) for Orangi Town revealed that three members of the gang have been apprehended, with an equal number of children recovered by law enforcement.According to the SP, the modus operandi of the gang involved enticing children with sums ranging from PKR 200 to PKR 300 before subjecting them to sexual exploitation . Additionally, the suspects were purportedly engaged in filming the abuse and circulating the videos within the vicinity, as reported by ARY News.The investigation into the matter was initiated following the disappearance of a child on May 11. Subsequent interrogations led to the unraveling of the gang's illicit activities.One of the suspects, identified as Nisar, reportedly enticed children from gaming zones and transported them to the gang's hideout. There, the minors were allegedly subjected to sexual abuse and also trafficked to others.It was disclosed by the police that the gang predominantly targeted children aged between 12 to 14 years.Law enforcement authorities further elaborated that the suspects employed a strategy of wearing a helmet associated with an online motorcycle service to evade detection while transporting the children from one location to another, ARY News reported.Data collected by Sahil, an NGO dedicated to addressing child sexual abuse, reveals a disturbing trend: the majority of abusers are individuals known to the victims, such as acquaintances, neighbours, or even family members.Shockingly, religious teachers and clerics emerge as the primary perpetrators within institutional settings, surpassing even police officers, school teachers, or nuclear family members in the number of complaints filed against them, according to Dawn.Primary data remains limited and organisations rely on media reports and police complaints but the trend over the past 20 years shows the gender divide of abused girls in madrassas is slightly higher than that of boys ('Cruel Numbers').","Police in Karachi have dismantled a gang allegedly engaged in the sexual abuse of children.

He added that temperatures could reach up to 6 degrees Celsius (10.8 Fahrenheit) above the monthly average. This week could rise above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) in many parts of the country, Babar said.It's the latest climate-related disaster to hit the country in recent years. Melting glaciers and growing monsoons have caused devastating floods, at one point submerging a third of the country.Pakistan recorded its wettest April since 1961, with more than double the usual monthly rainfall, according to the national weather center. Last month's heavy rains killed scores of people while destroyed property and farmland, experts say the country witnessed heavier rains because of climate change .Pakistan is still trying to recover from $30 billion in losses caused by devastating climate-induced floods that killed 1,739 people in 2022.According to health officials, hospitals were instructed to set up emergency heatwave response centers so that those affected by the scorching temperatures could be quickly treated.Doctors say heatstroke is a serious illness that occurs when one's body temperature rises quickly because of sweltering heat, potentially causing some to fall unconscious. A severe heatstroke can cause disability or death.Some areas in Pakistan are also currently facing hours-long power outages.""We were without electricity for hours on Monday,"" said Ibrar Abbasi, who lives on the outskirts of Islamabad.Scientists have long warned that climate change, driven by the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation and certain agricultural practices, will lead to more frequent and prolonged bouts of extreme weather, including hotter temperatures.Babar said another intense heat wave will hit the country in June, when the temperature is likely to reach 45 degrees (113 Fahrenheit). He said people should drink a lot of water and avoid unnecessary travel. Farmers and other livestock owners should take measures to protect their animals during extreme heat, he said.However, many people, especially laborers and construction workers in the impoverished nation, ask how they can stay indoors as their families will suffer if they don't work.""I am not feeling well because of the stifling heat, but I have to work,"" said Ghulam Farid, who owns a small general store in Sheikhupra, a city in Punjab province.Construction workers were seen sitting near a road on the outskirts of the capital, Islamabad, hoping to get a job.

NEW YORK: In perhaps the first acknowledgement of its kind on a global forum that the ""new India is a dangerous entity"", Pakistan 's Permanent Ambassador to the United Nations, Munir Akram said, invoking the alleged targeted and extra-judicial assassinations in his homeland and elsewhere.Pakistan's permanent representative at the world body also quoted from a report in a leading US daily to say the ""new India comes into your home and kills you"".Addressing the General Assembly on May 2, Akram said, ""Pakistan's foreign minister informed the Security Council, as well as the secretary general and the president of the General Assembly of India's campaign of targeted assassinations in Pakistan. This extra-territorial state terrorism is not limited to Pakistan. It has been extended to targeted killings of political opponents in Canada and attempted in the United States and probably in other countries.""""The Washington Post reported that Prime Minister Modi last week told his cheering supporters, and I quote, ""Today, even India's enemies know this is Modi. This is the new India. This new India comes into your home and kills you"". This new India is a dangerous entity, it is a net provider of insecurity, not security,"" Pakistan's permanent representative to the UN alleged.Earlier, top British daily, The Guardian, claimed in a report that the Indian government carried out assassinations of wanted individuals deep inside Pakistan as part of a ""wider strategy to eliminate terrorists living on foreign soil"".It said, citing intelligence sources, that targeted assassinations increased significantly in 2023, claiming India's involvement in the suspected deaths of about 15 people, ""most of whom were shot at close range by unknown gunmen"".Earlier, some countries in the West raised concerns over what they claimed were targeted killings on their soil at the behest of the Indian government.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused 'agents' allegedly in the employ of the Indian government of killing Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a pro-Khalistan leader and a designated terrorist by the country's elite National Investigation Agency (NIA), in 2020.However, India has dismissed the claim as 'absurd' and 'motivated'.Nijjar was shot and killed as he came out of a Gurdwara in Surrey in June last year. A purported video clip of his killing that reportedly surfaced in March, this year, showing Nijjar being shot by armed men in what was alleged to be a 'contract killing'.In a recent development in the Nijjar case, the Canadian Police arrested four Indian nationals for their alleged involvement in the killing of the separatist Khalistleader outside a gurudwara in British Columbia last June.Reacting to the arrests, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar denied receiving any evidence implicating Indian nationals' involvement in the killing in Canada of the India-designated terrorist.Responding to media queries, Jaishankar said, ""I also read that another arrest has been made. If that person is an Indian national, then usually by consular practice, you inform the government or the embassy of the country of origin. But beyond that, we have long maintained that if anything, any event in Canada, any violence in Canada, has any evidence or information which is relevant to be investigated in India, we are open to investigating it.""He emphasised that while any Indian national's arrest would usually prompt notification to the government or embassy, no specific evidence justifying investigation by Indian agencies has been received to date.""But to date, we have never received anything, which is specific and worthy of being pursued by our investigative agencies. And I'm not aware anything has changed in the last few days in that regard,"" the External Affairs Minister said at a media interaction at a seminar on Indian Capital Markets 'Roadmap for Viksit Bharat' at the National Stock Exchange (NSE) in Mumbai earlier.At a weekly media briefing, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), too, informed that Canada had not formally conveyed the arrests and India had not yet received any consular access request.On being asked about the fourth Indian arrested by Canada in connection with the Nijjar killing, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, ""We have seen reports of the fourth person being arrested. We have not been formally conveyed of it. So far, we have not received any consular access request as well.""Earlier, campaigning for the ongoing general elections in the country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a telling remark vis-a-vis its western neighbour, saying India does not send dossiers on terrorism anymore but eliminates terrorists in their own backyard.""Today, India doesn't send dossiers.(Today India strikes back at terrorists on their own turf),"" PM Modi said at a poll rally in Maharashtra's Latur.Expanding on the difference in how his government tackles terrorism as compared to previous Congress regimes at the Centre, Prime Minister Modi said the earlier approach of handing dossiers to Pakistan has been replaced by taking out the wanted terror conspirators on their own turf.At a separate rally, PM Modi doubled down on remarks made by the INDIA bloc leader Farooq Abdullah that Pakistan was not wearing bangles and was a nuclear-amed nation, saying, """" (I was told Pakistanis don't even have bangles, we will make them wear some)"".Addressing a public meeting in Muzaffarpur, PM Modi said, ""These (Congress and INDIA alliance) people are so afraid that they see Pakistan's atom bombs even in their dreams. Can such a government and leader run the country? They (INDI alliance leaders) say, ''. (i am told Pakistanis don't even have bangles...we will make them wear some. They are desperately crying out for wheat, they don't have electricity and now they don't even have bangles to wear.) Some leaders in the Opposition are even giving clean chits to the 26/11 accused.""""Some people are doubting the surgical strikes and air strikes (after the Uri and Pulwama terror attacks). These leaders want to weaken the morale of our forces and cast aspersions on our nuclear power.

Coated head to toe in eye-catching gold paint, they stood perfectly still, leaning on glimmering canes and tipping their top hats open. Perhaps in a different place, the emergence of mimes on the street looking to earn a few dollars might go unnoticed.But this is Pakistan , where things under the security state often are not as simple as they seem. So as the number of golden performers grew, so, too, did the intrigue around them. Could they be informants for the nation's intelligence agency? Lookouts for powerful politicians? Maybe spies for CIA ?Today, the ""golden men"" of Islamabad have been added to the ranks of the conspiracy theories sprouted, knocked down and rehashed every day across the city. In Pakistan, where the hand of the security services is seen everywhere, conspiracy theories have been embraced in the mainstream for decades. Suspicion has become so universal that wild tales take root after almost every news event. In the wake of catastrophic floods in 2010, people asserted that they had been caused by CIA weather-controlling technology. Media pundits claimed that a US ""thinktank"" was behind a failed car bombing by a Pakistani-American in Times Square that year and that Osama bin Laden was actually Jewish.In such a climate, everyone - even street performers - can be seen as potential tools of the state. For most of Pakistan's 76-year history, the surveillance was a routine facet of daily life. But in recent years, frustration with the military's role in politics has exploded. ""With the political atmosphere so polarised, we're becoming more suspicious of being watched or who is listening,"" said Ali Abas, 25, a resident of Islamabad.On the other side of the city, Mustaq Ahmed, 53, stood on a median of a busy intersection. His jacket, pants, walking cane and top hat were all spray-painted gold. Gold makeup was caked onto his face and hand. Ahmed once sold umbrellas, but became ""Golden Thakur"" three years ago after he overheard another golden man saying he made up to Pak Rs 8,000 - or nearly $30 - each day. It was more than five times what Ahmed was taking home. That cash has dwindled recently as the novelty of the golden men has waned, he said. When asked if he would ever supplement his income with a little side work for the intelligence agencies, he immediately replied: ""no, no, no."" Was there any chance that other golden men were earning a few extra dollars that way? ""Maybe,"" he said with a shrug.

The upcoming election in Sri Lanka will have a major impact on the future of the island nation and human rights considerations for years to come, the global rights NGO said in a statement issued at the end of a five-day visit by its Secretary General Agnes Callamard to the country.The presidential election in Sri Lanka is scheduled to take place between mid-September and mid-October.""The visit has provided insights into many challenges that Sri Lanka is confronting 15 years after the end of the war (with the LTTE ),"" the statement said.Callamard visited the northeastern Mullaithvu district on Sunday to commemorate the fallen victims from the Tamil side to mark the 15th anniversary of the end of the final conflict.""A seemingly lack of political will, along with complacency in delivering justice prevents reconciliation,"" the statement said, calling on the international community to work with the island's authorities to secure truth and justice for all victims of the war and the ongoing human rights violations and lay the foundation for a freer and fairer Sri Lanka.Amnesty said during the visit, the focus had been centred on threats to civil society; freedom of expression; the right to peaceful protest; the use of anti-terror laws such as the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) to suppress dissent; harassment; intimidation; surveillance and obstacles to press freedom.It said the new legislation such as the Online Security Act and the proposed non-governmental organisation law are worrying evidence of the dangers faced by civil society in the country.The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) had run a military campaign for a separate Tamil homeland in the northern and eastern provinces of the island nation for nearly 30 years before its collapse in 2009.On May 18, 2009, the Sri Lankan Army declared victory with the discovery of the body of the dreaded LTTE leader Velupillai Prabakaran .Despite the passage of nearly 15 years since the end of the armed conflict and many decades since the earliest waves of enforced disappearances, Sri Lankan authorities are still failing to ensure accountability for these violations. Tamil groups claimed a large number of civilians had perished during the final battle.A report issued by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights ( OHCHR ) on Friday said the Sri Lankan government must take meaningful action to determine and disclose the fates and whereabouts of tens of thousands of people who have been subjected to enforced disappearance over the decades and hold those responsible to account.It called for renewed action by Sri Lanka at the domestic level to hold it to account through criminal justice. The report also called for the international community to be engaged with Sri Lanka for investigation and prosecutions for targeted sanctions.Sri Lanka maintains that OHCHR is not mandated by the member states to issue any such report.","There is seemingly a ""lack of political will"" in delivering justice to the many victims of Sri Lanka's three-decade-long internal armed conflict, Amnesty International says.

LONDON: A former British marine charged with spying for Hong Kong's intelligence service has died, according to a police statement released Tuesday.
