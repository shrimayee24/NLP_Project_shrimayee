quota

CHHATRAPATI SAMBHAJINAGAR/PUNE: OBC activists Laxman Hake and Navnath Waghmare suspended their indefinite hunger strike on its tenth day on Saturday following a written assurance from state govt on the protection of reservations for the community.On Saturday, a second state govt delegation, led by food and civil supplies minister Chhagan Bhujbal, met the agitators at Wadigodri village with the govt's written assurance, stating that none of the backward community reservations would be diluted or affected. Suspending his strike, Hake called this a ""30-40% win"".Bhujbal, however, warned his own govt that the fight to safeguard the OBC rights has only been temporarily halted, and it would continue till the community gets justice.Chief minister Eknath Shinde, who was in Nashik, also thanked Hake for withdrawing his strike. He said govt was committed to resolving the OBC-Maratha reservation issue amicably. ""We will soon convene an all-party meeting soon to discuss and resolve the issue in the interest of all the people of the state,"" he said.The state delegation also visited Pune to convince OBC activist Mangesh Sasane, who too was observing a hunger strike. While Hake and Sasane withdrew their hunger strikes, Bhujbal said that the fight was not over yet.Addressing OBC supporters in Pune, Bhujbal said, ""This fight is far from over. We have a long way to go. Though Hake and Sasane have withdrawn their hunger strikes, the agitation has only been halted. When we feel that OBCs are facing injustice, the fight will resume.""He added that issuance of OBC certificates to the Maratha community members would not be accepted. ""We have observed that Kunbi certificates to the Maratha community members have been issued without adequate verification. This is nothing but a backdoor entry into the OBC quota. We will not allow this. We will raise the issue in the all-party meeting,"" Bhujbal said. Accusing the opposition of politicising the Maratha-OBC issue, he said, ""I warned those parties not to use the issue in the election agenda. Elections will come and go, but due to politicisation of the issue, several generations will suffer consequences.""On Friday, a first state govt delegation had met the two OBC activists but had failed to convince them to end their hunger strike. As a result, govt sent a second delegation. Apart from Bhujbal, ministers Uday Samant, Girish Mahajan, Dhananjay Munde, Atul Save, Gulabrao Patil, MLC Gopichand Padalkar and OBC leader Prakash Shendge were part of this second delegation.When contacted, Hake told TOI: ""The state govt delegation has assured us that all caste certificates will be linked with Aadhaar, a cabinet sub-panel for OBCs will be formed and the sage soyare law will be passed only after it is discussed in an all-party meeting. We have also been assured that govt employees issuing bogus Kunbi certificates as well as those receiving them will be prosecuted.""After calling of the strike, Hake and Waghmare were admitted to a hospital in Jalna.In Wadigodri, Bhujbal, without naming Maratha activist Manoj Jarange, said, ""When will the injustice against us end? Their bullying will not be tolerated. Quota is not for wiping out poverty. It is for bringing the backward communities into the mainstream."" Minister Dhananjay Munde said state govt is making efforts to ensure that nobody's rights are encroached upon. ""Our govt does not want any friction between the Marathas and OBCs.,"" he said.","OBC activists Laxman Hake and Navnath Waghmare suspended their indefinite hunger strike on its tenth day on Saturday.

Pilgrims faced extreme heat during the annual Haj pilgrimage in Mecca, resulting in multiple deaths. The Saudi General Authority for Statistics expected over 1.8 million participants this year.

52C at Mecca: 13 Keralite haj pilgrims among 922 dead

Minister Abdurahiman reports 13 Keralites died in scorching temperatures during Mecca pilgrimage, demanding Centre's intervention to solve problems faced by pilgrims. He addresses Union ministers and Consulate General about pilgrims' difficulties in Saudi Arabia, including complaints about negligence in activities of mutawwifs and poor accommodation in Assisi.

HYDERABAD: With limited buses to ferry them, many Haj pilgrims said that they had to walk for over 40km, even as temperatures touched 52 degree Celsius.Speaking over phone from Saudi Arabia, Hyderabad resident Md Fareed told TOI that many pilgrims had developed blisters on their feet, were running high temperature , suffered sunstroke, and fainted mid-way owing to the scorching heat .“The lack of buses only compounded the problem. We walked for over 7.5 km to reach Arafat from Mina,” said Fareed, adding, “I got blisters on my feet and my wife fainted as we walked for over 40km during the pilgrimage .”The Musheerabad resident is among the 300 who have completed their Haj and are waiting to board flights back to their home country this weekend.Many pilgrims from Telangana said that they had to wait for 8 to 10 hours for buses to arrive. “The main problem was with transportation. Hundreds of pilgrims from the city had to wait for hours to get a bus. Many even fainted during the wait,” said one of the 41 khadims, who travelled from Hyderabad to assist Hajis.He also claimed that they had to walk for long hours without food and water. “As a result, many pilgrims, especially those who are diabetic and have blood pressure issues, suffered during their pilgrimage,” he added.While Telangana State Haj Committee officials agreed to lack of amenities on day 1, they said that they were resolved subsequently. “There was an issue with food and accommodation initially as most of the buildings are used only during Haj. It took us about 18 hours to get them resolved. Moreover, many had to wait for over eight hours to board a bus to perform Haj,” said Shaik Liyakat Hussain, CEO, Haj Committee.Officials said the problem with transportation arose as the contract this time was given to two agencies instead of one like every year. “Also, the buses were getting stuck in traffic as lakhs of pilgrims were at Haj,” the official added.","Saudi health official Jameel Abualenain reported no abnormal deaths during Haj.

BENGALURU: In a midnight operation , police probing the Renukaswamy murder case retrieved Sandalwood actor Darshan's loafers, allegedly used in the crime, from his wife Vijayalakshmi 's flat at Hoskerehalli in south Bengaluru.Renukaswamy was beaten to death, allegedly by Darshan, his girlfriend Pavithra Gowda , and his aides, on June 8. On Saturday, police had sought extension of the accused's custody, saying they had to seize Darshan's clothes and shoes as they were crucial evidence.Police initially thought that Darshan's clothes and footwear could be found either in his house in Rajarajeshwari Nagar or at Pavithra's residence in Kenchenahalli. They had not factored in the possibility of any of this material ending up in the house of the actor's wife, with whom his ties are said to be anything but cordial.According to sources, Darshan told his interrogators that he had kept the clothes and footwear he was wearing on the day of the crime in his RR Nagar residence. Police were hoping to find Renukaswamy's bloodstains on it.A team of police and FSL officials took Darshan and his aide Pavan K to his residence at Ideal Township in RR Nagar at 11.15pm Saturday. Darshan's employee Babul Khan opened the door. As informed by Darshan, police rummaged through a plastic bin on the first floor, but in vain. Darshan and Khan told them that there are possibilities that the domestic help might have taken the clothes for washing to the terrace. The blue jeans trousers of True Religion brand and a black round-neck T-shirt of Opium Valley brand, which the actor was wearing on the day of the crime, were found on the terrace.When asked about his footwear, Darshan took them to the ground floor and showed them a cupboard near the sitting room. But the loafers weren't there.Sources said Pavan told police that the footwear may have been taken to Mysuru by Darshan's costume assistant Raju when he went for shooting. Police contacted Raju over phone at 12.56am and went near his house in Attiguppe. He informed police that he had given a few clothes, shoes and other valuables of Darshan to his wife Vijayalakshmi. Police immediately contacted Vijayalakshmi, who replied that there were a few shoes of her husband at her home.According to sources, Vijayalakshmi asked police not to visit her flat as it was past midnight and she had a minor son at home. She informed police that she would bring all of Darshan's shoes near the apartment security room and they could check them there.Officials rushed to the Hosakerehalli apartment with Darshan. When police personnel reached the security room, Vijayalakshmi had kept a few shoes and other footwear there. Darshan identified the blue loafers he had worn that day. FSL officials seized them.Police commissioner B Dayananda told media that his team is working hard to ensure justice is delivered to the victim's family.","Renukaswamy was beaten to death, allegedly by Darshan, his girlfriend Pavithra Gowda, and his aides, on June 8.

A video of loco pilot Ajay Kumar and his assistant Ranjit Kumar, putting their lives at risk to ensure safety of passengers and preventing a potential train mishap, went viral on social media on Saturday. The incident happened on Thursday when the Narkatiaganj-Gorakhpur passenger train came to an abrupt halt on the rail bridge between Valmikinagar and Paniahwa due to a technical issue.

Samastipur divisional railway manager (DRM) Vinay Srivastava said the locomotive pilots quickly identified the problem as a leakage in air pressure. “Although reaching the spot was extremely challenging and posed a significant risk to their lives, the loco pilots remained composed and used their presence of mind. They precariously crawled along the bridge’s edge, tightly gripping it with their hands, to access the area beneath the locomotive. Once there, they successfully plugged the air pressure leakage,” the DRM said. In recognition of their “remarkable courage”, the railway administration has announced a cash reward of Rs 10,000 and commendation certificates for the two loco pilots.

Fadel Naem, director of the al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City, said more than three dozen bodies arrived at the hospital. The Palestinian Civil Defense, an emergency group active in Gaza, said it pulled approximately the same number of bodies from a building hit by an Israeli strike in an eastern neighbourhood of Gaza City. Israel said Saturday that its fighter jets struck two Hamas military sites in the Gaza City area but did not elaborate further. The deaths come a day after at least 25 people were killed in strikes.

Israel said Saturday that it was continuing to operate in central and southern Gaza and has pushed ahead with its invasion of Rafah, where over a million Palestinians had sought refuge from fighting elsewhere.

DUBAI: An attack by Yemen 's Houthi rebels targeted a commercial ship travelling through the Gulf of Aden but apparently caused no damage, authorities said Saturday, in the latest strike on the shipping lane by the group.

The Houthi attack comes after the sinking this week of the ship Tutor, which marked what appears to be a new escalation by the Iranian-backed Houthis in their campaign of strikes on ships in the vital maritime corridor over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.

Meanwhile, US officials reportedly ordered the USS Dwight D Eisenhower, the aircraft carrier leading America's response to the Houthi attacks, to return home after a twice-extended tour. The captain of the ship targeted late Friday saw ""explosions in the vicinity of the vessel"", the British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations centre said. A later briefing by the US-overseen Joint Maritime Information Centre said the vessel reported two explosions off its port side and a third one later. ""It was not hit and sustained no damage,"" the centre said. ""The vessel and crew are reported to be safe and are proceeding to their next port of call.""

The Houthis have launched more than 60 attacks targeting specific vessels and fired off other missiles and drones in their campaign that has killed a total of four sailors. They have seized one vessel and sunk two since November. A US-led airstrike campaign has targeted the Houthis since January, with a series of strikes May 30 killing at least 16 people and wounding 42 others, the rebels say.

In March, the Belize-flagged Rubymar carrying fertilizer became the first to sink after taking on water for days following a rebel attack.ap

The discovered late Bronze Age ship is seen as one of the oldest known examples of ships sailing far from land.The ship so far out at sea indicates that the navigation abilities of ancient seafarers were more advanced than previously thought because they could travel without a line of sight to land, the the Israel Antiquities Authority told news agency AP.The depth at which the ship was found implies it was left undisturbed by waves, currents or fishermen over the millennia, offering greater scope for research.""The discovery of this boat now changes our entire understanding of ancient mariner abilities. It is the very first to be found at such a great distance with no line of sight to any landmass,"" said Jacob Sharvit, head of the IAA marine unit, adding that two similar ships from the same era had been discovered previously, but only close to shore.A recently discovered wooden ship, approximately 12 to 14 meters long, was found by Energean, a natural gas company, 90 kilometers off Israel's Mediterranean coast. The vessel, unearthed at a depth of 1,800 meters, is over 1,000 years old and was located using a submersible robot. Researchers believe the ship likely navigated by the sun and stars and might have sunk due to a storm or a pirate attack.Energean found the vessel buried under hundreds of ancient jugs, all of which were fully intact. The company encountered the ship about a year ago while conducting routine operations in Israel's territorial waters.Traditionally, researchers assumed that trade during this era was conducted by boats sailing close to the shore. These boats moved from port to port, constantly keeping an eye on the land. However, this new discovery suggests a different navigation practice.""The newly discovered boat's sailors probably used the sun and the stars to find their way,"" said Sharvit.The Israeli Antiquities Authority (IAA) confirmed that the boat and its cargo are intact. The ship currently remains on the sea floor, and there are no immediate plans to retrieve it.","A 3,300-year-old ship and its cargo have been discovered by a company drilling for natural gas off the coast of northern Israel. The discovered late Bronze Age ship is seen as one of the oldest known examples of ships sailing far from land. The ship currently remains on the sea floor, and there are no immediate plans to retrieve it.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111160169,imgsize-1532543,width-400,resizemode-4/111160169.jpg"

Bruen, was the only dissenter

WASHINGTON: The US Supreme Court ruled Friday that the government can take guns away from people subject to restraining orders for domestic violence, limiting the sweep of a blockbuster decision in 2022 that had vastly expanded Second Amendment rights .

Indeed, Friday's decision amounted to a retreat from what had been an unbroken series of major rulings favouring gun rights that started in 2008, when the court first recognized an individual constitutional right to keep firearms in the home for self-defense.

In the 2022 decision, the court established a right to carry guns outside the home and announced a new test to assess all sorts of gun control laws , one that looked to historical practices to judge their constitutionality. That new test has sown confusion in the lower courts, with some judges striking down laws that had been on the books for decades.

The case decided Friday, United States v. Rahimi, asked whether a Texas man could be prosecuted under federal law making it a crime for people subject to domestic violence restraining orders to possess guns. Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for the majority in the 8-1 decision, said the answer was yes and that Second Amendment rights have limits.

There were rumors that DJT had backing from the Trump family as Donald Trump in a recent interview expressed his interest in crypto. Research firm Arkham then offered a $150,000 bounty to anyone who could prove the identity of DJT's creator. It was then that Martin Shkreli floated his story. According to a Fortune report, crypto sleuth ZachXBT claimed the prize by proving that Shkreli had created the token as part of an alleged pump-and-dump scheme.

— ArkhamIntel (@ArkhamIntel) Cameron Roxburgh was another participant in the scheme who was a classmate of Barron Trump. But there is no evidence of Barron Trump being involved in this. After this big reveal, Shkreli joined a live chat on X and claimed that DJT would soon receive an endorsement from Barron Trump or any other Trump-world figure. Shkreli said he was surprised that the president's son approached him through a friends for a meme coin. Barron Trump apparently told Shkreli that his father had approved of the project. In the X Space, Shkreli was asked whether the token was created to raise fund for Donald Trump's presidential campaign. He said it was for Barron Trump. Shkreli's latest tweet on DJT meme coin was defiant. ""I have nothing further to say on $DJT. You will see the official truth soon. I know I'm right and have zero to prove to any of you.

The incident unfolded on May 25 in Sargodha's Mujahid Colony, where Nazir and other Christians were accused of blasphemy , sparking violent outrage among locals.After fighting for his life for eight days, Masih succumbed to his injuries on Sunday.The incident showed a troubling pattern in Pakistan where blasphemy accusations lead to violence against Christian communities.HRFP has expressed deep concern over the swift post-arrest bail granted to 52 attackers involved in the Sargodha incident.Despite the First Information Report (FIR) being filed against 44 identified and 400 unidentified suspects under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) 1997 and Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), progress in police investigations and court proceedings has been slow and inadequate.Compounding the community's apprehensions are threatening videos released by Islamic groups following the incident, exacerbating fears among the Christian community.Drawing parallels with the August 16, 2023, attack in Jaranwala, the HRFP report highlighted similar incidents of mob violence and property destruction against minorities. It underscores a recurring pattern involving provocation, and subsequent violence, often followed by the expedient release of perpetrators.HRFP has called for decisive action, citing intelligence reports linking extremist groups to multiple blasphemy allegations.

NEW DELHI: In a heart-wrenching display of their persistent sorrow and discontent, families affected by enforced disappearances in the Balochistan region of Pakistan decided to abandon customary Eid festivities. Instead, they planned to stage a protest to voice their outrage against state agencies alleged to have perpetrated atrocities against the Baloch people.

Mama Qadir Baloch , a key member of the Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP), declared the protest in a video statement, asserting, ""For the past 15 years, the atrocities committed by the Army and intelligence agencies of Pakistan have led the Baloch to boycott Eid celebrations. While Muslims across the world celebrate this occasion, the Baloch mourn.""

Coinciding with this, families of the missing persons organized a sit-in protest at Shaheed Fida Chowk on Eid day, following a similar demonstration in front of the DC office just days prior. The earlier protest concluded after the district administration provided assurances to the families.

The decision to protest on Eid emphasizes the profound impact of enforced disappearances on the Baloch community, who have been tirelessly seeking justice and answers regarding the fate of their loved ones, allegedly taken by state forces.
