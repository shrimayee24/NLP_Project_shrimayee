'Perform Al-Ameen salute': J&K medico alleges ragging in Karnataka college; 5 arrested,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jk-medico-alleges-ragging-in-vijayapura-college-5-held/articleshow/118397552.cms,"VIJAYAPURA: A 22-year-old student from Kashmir studying at Al-Ameen Medical College in Vijayapura, about 500km from Bengaluru, has alleged he was ragged and assaulted by seniors during a cricket match and later in college hostel on Tuesday.Vijayapura superintendent of police Laxman Nimbargi confirmed to TOI that Hamim was assaulted, and five seniors allegedly involved in the incident have been arrested on assault and ragging charges under Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita and Karnataka Education Act, 1983.However, the college played down the incident as ""a minor altercation"".According to the Jammu Kashmir Students' Association (JKSA), Hamim, a second-year student from J&K's Anantnag, was assaulted by five students from the 2019 batch. JKSA national convener Nasir Khuehami claimed Hamim had been subjected to ""months of harassment due to a power struggle"" as he captains the 2023-batch cricket team.The accused arrested have been identified as Mohammed Zainul, 23, from Vijayapura; Sameer, 24, from Sandur, Ballari district; Shaik Sawood, 23, from Mudagal, Raichur district; Mansoor Bhasha, 24, from Shiraguppa, Ballari district; and Muzzaffer alias Mujeeb Jamadar, 23, from Indi Taluk, Vijayapura district.The alleged incident took place Tuesday evening during a match between the 2019 and 2022 batches. ""While standing near the boundary line, a senior asked him to stay outside. He promptly moved away. As verbal intimidation escalated, seniors humiliated him, ordered him to perform an ‘Al-Ameen salute', sing songs, and dance for their amusement. They even attempted to force him into their car,"" Khuehami alleged.When Hamim refused, citing college regulations, tensions escalated. ""Sensing danger, he took out his phone to record the incident, hoping it would deter them. Instead, this enraged them. Later in the evening, 6-8 individuals stormed into his hostel room and assaulted him. They repeatedly beat him, forced him to record a video apologising under duress, and issued death threats, warning he would not be allowed to play cricket for the next four years,"" Khuehami added.Following a social-media post tagging PM Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah, J&K CM Omar Abdullah, Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah and deputy CM DK Shivakumar, the matter drew attention of Vijayapura Rural police officials, who visited the college to conduct an inquiry.Dr Jilani Awati, medical college superintendent, said, ""The incident was a quarrel between two student teams during the cricket match. Hamim might have informed the Kashmiri student leader, who, unaware of the full context, sought help by tagging officials on social media. Disciplinary action will be taken if any misconduct is proven.""He said the college has a strict anti-ragging policy, claiming, ""In our 40 years of existence, no case of ragging has been reported.""","22-year-old Kashmiri studying at Al-Ameen Medical College in Vijayapura, about 500km from Bengaluru.

‘Accidental death’ in Gujarat turns out to be murder by same-sex partner,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/accidental-death-in-gujarat-turns-out-to-be-murder-by-same-sex-partner/articleshow/118396757.cms,"SURAT: What initially seemed like an accidental death at an embroidery unit in Katargam was uncovered as a premeditated murder by a 19-year-old who allegedly strangled his 24-year-old gay partner on Feb 8.The investigation and subsequent arrest of the accused revealed that he was upset over the victim's involvement with other men and a video of their sexual act recorded on the victim's phone.On Feb 8, the accused tried to disguise the 24-year-old partner's killing as a death caused by accidental strangulation in a machine. The accused also wanted the victim to delete a video of their engagement in a sexual act that he recorded on his phone, as revealed by the investigation by the Katargam police.To avoid suspicion, the accused himself went to the hospital with the victim and also attended his last rites in their native place in Bihar.Katargam police inspector B K Chaudhary told TOI: ""While investigating at the crime scene, we found a mobile phone dumped under the machine in which the victim got strangled and died. We registered an accidental death case and began an investigation. We handed over the body to the deceased's family, who took him to Bihar. Our probe found many suspicious things which led us to the accused, who murdered the victim and tried to disguise it as an accidental death.""The duo lived in a room in the Katargam area and were in a same-sex relationship. During one tryst, the accused shot a video, which the teenager did not like. Moreover, the accused also did not like his partner having relationships with other men. He threatened to kill the victim in the past and quarrelled in the presence of their roommates many times.On Feb 8, when the 24-year-old was on night duty at the embroidery unit, the accused, who worked in a neighbouring factory, went there. Before his partner arrived, the victim switched off his mobile phone and hid it under the machine because he did not want to delete the video. When the accused insisted on handing over the phone to him to delete the video, the victim refused. The accused then allegedly strangled the victim with his gamchha (scarf) and set the body inside the machine in a manner that made it look like an accidental death.""We found important evidence on the victim's phone. We also found the accused's movements suspicious in CCTV footage. The light on the stairs of the unit would always be on, but that night, someone switched it off. We connected the dots and sent a team to Bihar to nab the assailant, who went to the funeral of the victim as he was a close friend. We apprehended him and brought him to Surat. He confessed to the crime,"" Chaudhary said.","A 19-year-old allegedly strangled his gay partner at an embroidery unit in Katargam, Gujarat, on Feb 8.

Plan to divert Manikaran ‘holy water’ in Himachal Pradesh stirs row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/plan-to-divert-manikaran-holy-water-in-himachal-pradesh-stirs-row/articleshow/118396685.cms,"KULLU: A proposal to transfer water from the natural hot water springs at Manikaran - a site of pilgrimage for both Hindus and Sikhs - to the nearby popular tourist destination of Kasol, 4km away, in Parvati Valley of Kullu district has upset the locals. Residents have threatened mass agitation if the plan to ""use the holy water for commercial purposes"" is not withdrawn.It was proposed at the recent meeting of the Special Area Development Authority that a new nature park would be built in Kasol, having 'jacuzzi hot baths', water for which would be brought from Manikaran through a network of pipes.Enraged by the proposal, Manikaran residents met Kullu deputy commissioner Torul S Ravish and sent a memorandum to the CM, demanding scrapping of the plan. ""Manikaran is a site of pilgrimage, and no one should be allowed to misuse the water. If govt wants to build hot baths, then they should do it in Manikaran itself,"" said Narender Kumar, a local. He added that even the deities were against transferring water from Manikaran to Kasol.Opposing the project, local resident Shailender Sharma said, ""Imposition of SADA in Manikaran has led to zero development, and now they want to take away our water... we would not let them do so."" The proposal has also sparked a war of words among local politicians. BJP's Narotam Thakur accused Kullu's Cong MLA Sundar Singh Thakur of having ""vested interest"" in the project. ""It's a bad idea to transfer the holy water of Manikaran, which is a globally famous religious site. Neither the people of Manikaran want the water to be diverted nor the people of Kasol. It's just the local MLA...,"" he added.Last week, former MP Maheshwar Singh had publicly voiced opposition to the proposal, saying that the water from a sacred site like Manikaran should not be used for commercial purposes as ""the holy water of Manikaran is used even by the local deities"". Responding to the allegations, Kullu MLA Sunder Singh Thakur had last week said, ""Whenever we have talked about development, some people in Kullu have opposed it, making religion an excuse. They opposed projects from the ski village to even paragliding in Dhalpur, Kullu. But no one will be allowed to thwart the development process on the pretext of religion.""","Proposal to transfer water from Manikaran hot water springs to Kasol, 4km away, has upset the locals.

""As per today's reports, the amount of BOD near Sangam is less than 3 (milligrams per litre), and the dissolved oxygen is around 8-9,"" he said.This meant the Sangam water was suitable not just for bathing but also for drinking, he asserted.

A six-month-old tiger cub was killed after being hit by an unidentified vehicle while crossing the Rampur-Haldwani road in the Tanda range of the Terai Central Forest Division , about 1.5 km from Sanjay Van around 9pm Tuesday, officials said. Tanda range officer Roop Narayan Gautam and his team reached the spot upon receiving the information and took the cub's carcass into custody.""The vehicle that struck the cub remains unidentified. An autopsy will be conducted Wednesday and we are initiating legal action against the unknown driver,"" Gautam said. He added that tigers, elephants, and other wildlife frequently cross this stretch of road.""A tigress was spotted in the area a few days ago. The deceased cub likely belonged to her,"" he said. This is not the first such incident. On Jan 6 last year, a six-year-old tiger was fatally hit by a car. Several similar accidents have been reported in the past. In 2023, a six-year-old tiger was fatally struck by a speeding car on the Haldwani road near Rudrapur.

"Car crash in Kolkata leads to 3 bodies at home, cops suspect suicide pact",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/car-crash-in-kolkata-leads-to-3-bodies-at-home-cops-suspect-suicide-pact/articleshow/118396594.cms,"KOLKATA: A car crash on EM Bypass early Wednesday that left three members of a family gravely injured, followed by the discovery of three lifeless bodies of family members of the crash survivors at their home in Kolkata's Tangra has left police sniffing a suicide pact, even though they have also lodged a murder complaint.Police suspect the family members were driven to take the extreme step after failing to recover from Covid-time losses in their leather goods manufacturing trade. The family lived jointly in a four-storey house. The chain of events, at least the public part of it, began at 3.35am near Avishikta crossing, when a sedan - occupied by Prasun Dey, 45, Pranay Dey,44, and Pratip Dey,14, Pranay's son - dashed into a pillar at 100kmph, smashing the vehicle beyond recognition. Miraculously, all the three occupants were alive, and taken to hospital.The next link of the macabre chain fell into place six hours later, when Pranay told cops from his hospital bed that there were three women lying dead at his house - his wife Sudeshna, sister-in-law Romi and niece Priyamvada, joint CP Rupesh Kumar told TOI. Pranay said the family had consumed payesh (a traditional dessert) laced with sedatives in order to die, and some of them also inflicted injuries on themselves. He said the three of them then set out in the car to die by suicide. Pratip was sitting in rear seat with his father, while his brother was driving.Cops rushed to the Deys's house and broke open the main door lock to gain entry. On the first floor, they found the three bodies in different rooms.

Taylor Swift Gets Dragged Into The Blake Lively - Justin Baldoni Drama Due To Fresh Evidence Hinting At Her Involvement



Isabela Ferrer REVEALS Taylor Swift Helped Her Get ‘It Ends with Us’ Role (Exclusive)

Fans Have Reacted Pretty Strongly As Many Slam Blake Lively For The Whole Drama



Taylor Swift, the billionaire pop star, has been in the news ever since she got booed at the Super Bowl 2025 while her boyfriend, Travis Kelce led Kansas City Chiefs lost the trophy to the Philadelphia Eagles. Away from the Super Bowl drama, Taylor Swift has also gotten herself involved in the legal drama between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni, even though she has not been sued. But now it seems like there is some fresh drama regarding it.Famous social media influencer Melanie King recently uploaded a video on X with some fresh evidence that Taylor Swift was indeed “involved” in the making of Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni’s hit movie It Ends With Us. The video has Justin Baldoni talking to an interviewer about the casting for Isabella Ferrer who played the role of young Blake in the blockbuster movie.As Justin Baldoni discusses about finding the perfect person for the role, the interviewer says, “You told me Taylor Swift helped her get the role? Like signed off on audition?”To this, Justin Baldoni says, “I was casting and I had actually brought in and showed her casting tape to Blake and Taylor. They were both like “Yes her!” and that’s a true story”. The interviewer then asked Justin Baldoni how he had convinced Taylor Swift to lend her song for their movie and Justin Baldoni says, “I had nothing to do with it. I mean this is all Blake”.Justin Baldoni continued, “Like I said, Blake was involved in all aspects of this production and she is also a marketing genius”.Melanie King’s caption for the video reads as, “Taylor Swift caught in a HUGE lie. She said she had no part in the casting of this actress for It Ends With Us. Ma’am Justin Baldoni has the receipts. Bless his heart. He was trying to be positive while they were destroying his entire life behind the scenes.”The social media influencer, Melanie King, also went on to add that even though Taylor Swift did not officially cast Isabella Ferrer in the movie, it was her choice that was taken into consider by the production company.Fans have reacted strongly to this. A fan commented, “I don't know that Taylor is lying. She may have just been having conversations with her friend, who then used that to get her way. I'm not saying it didn't happen, but I lean towards Blake twisting things to use the power of Taylor's name”.Another fan wrote, “I suspect Blake has been overstating how involved Taylor actually is.”Taylor Swift has not issued a statement about the whole drama between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni and has remained silent. Blake Lively was recently spotted on the SNL red carpet with her husband Ryan Reynolds.Also Read: Bill Belichick and 24-year-old girlfriend Jordon Hudson discuss prenup as their relationship takes a serious turn","Taylor Swift has been in the news ever since she got booed at the Super Bowl 2025 while her boyfriend, Travis Kelce led Kansas City Chiefs lost the trophy to the Philadelphia Eagles.

"Brian Molko Defamation Charges: Rock band Placebo's lead Brian Molko charged for calling Italian PM Meloni a ‘fascist, racist, and Nazi’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/rock-band-placebos-lead-brian-molko-charged-for-calling-italian-pm-meloni-a-fascist-racist-and-nazi/articleshow/118402688.cms,"A rock band artist has been charged with defamation after allegedly calling Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni a “fascist” and a “Nazi” during a concert in Turin, the Telegraph reports.The 52-year-old Placebo frontman Brian Molko made the remarks at the Sonic Park festival in 2023, where he reportedly also called Meloni a “piece of s***, fascist, racist.” His comments were met with backlash from Meloni’s far-right Brothers of Italy party, which has its roots in Italy’s neo-fascist movement.Following a complaint from police present at the event, Turin prosecutors launched an investigation into Molko for defamation and contempt. On Monday, Italy’s justice ministry approved the prosecutors' request to officially charge him.Defamation in Italy is a serious offence that can carry a prison sentence of up to three years. However, a spokesman for justice minister Carlo Nordio indicated that a prison term is unlikely in this case. If found guilty, Molko is expected to face a fine of approximately €5,000 (£4,200).Italy’s criminal code penalises anyone who “publicly defames the republic,” which includes the government, parliament, courts, and the army.Molko is not the first person to face legal action for criticising Meloni. In 2023, journalist Roberto Saviano was found guilty of defamation and fined just over $1,000 for calling Meloni a “bastard” in response to her hardline stance on migration.Similarly, in July 2024, an Italian judge ordered journalist Giulia Cortese to pay Meloni €5,000 (£4,210) in damages for mocking her height on social media, ruling that it amounted to “body shaming.” Cortese, who was also given a suspended fine of €1,200, condemned the ruling, accusing the Italian government of restricting free speech.“This country seems to get closer to Orbán’s Hungary,” she wrote on X. “These are bad times for independent journalists and opinion leaders. Let’s hope for better days ahead. We won’t give up!”In another case, Meloni previously sued a historian who allegedly called her a “neo-Nazi in her soul” in 2022. However, she later dropped the lawsuit.The case against Molko has reignited debates about free speech in Italy, with critics arguing that the government is using defamation laws to suppress dissent. While defamation laws exist in many countries, Italy’s approach to prosecuting public figures over political statements has drawn scrutiny.","Brian Molko, 52, made the remarks at the Sonic Park festival in 2023.

Delta Plane Crash Toronto: Delta plane crash-landing at Toronto airport: Viral posts claim all pilots were female,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/delta-plane-crash-at-toronto-airport-viral-posts-claim-all-pilots-were-female-what-is-the-truth/articleshow/118392846.cms,"<p>Viral posts claimed all pilots of the Delta plane that crash-landed in Toronto were females. <br></p>

Delta crash-landing: Here's what we know



What Delta CEO said



Though no lives were lost, the crash-landing of a Delta flight at the Toronto Airport Monday sent shockwaves as the plane turned upside down with the passengers hanging like bats inside. Several social media posts went viral claiming that all of the pilots of that particular aircraft were women and Delta's DEI (diversity, equity, inclusivity) is to be blamed for the mishap that was averted. Videos of women pilots are also doing the rounds claiming that they were the pilots of the plane.However, there is no confirmation about the claims as Delta has not received any details about the pilots and not even any information about the gender of the pilots. All the photos doing the rounds are hence unverified.Social media posts claimed the Delta flight that crash-landed was operated by Endeavor Air which is a ""small airline obsessed with all-female unmanned flights"". Old posts from Endeavor Air's social media handle are being shared with malicious claims that the female pilots shown in these old posts were the pilots of the fateful plane.At least 18 people were injured when the plane with 80 people on board from Minneapolis turned upside down on the runway. It is not yet known what caused the horrific incident but poor weather is being seen as a reason. Airport CEO Deborah Flint praised the pilots for their response to the critical situation ensuring no lives were lost.When the plane neared the airport, air traffic controllers informed the pilots about 38mph wind gusts and within two minutes, the plane flipped. Fire erupted after the plane tumbled and the plane slammed into the runway. As the passengers were hanging upside down, the flight attendants helped them crawl out of the doors.Some social media posts claimed that the controllers said the pilot was a male.Delta CEO Ed Bastian said the flight crew on the plane was experienced and trained for difficult conditions. However, the CEO did not identify the pilots. ""There is one level of safety at Delta. All these pilots train for these conditions. This is what we train for. We train for this continuously,"" the CEO said.",Viral posts claimed all pilots of the Delta plane that crash-landed in Toronto were females.

California judge shoots wife during argument while watching 'Breaking Bad',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/california-judge-shoots-wife-during-argument-while-watching-breaking-bad/articleshow/118403215.cms,"A Southern California judge who fatally shot his wife during an argument at their home is now on trial for murder, with prosecutors arguing the killing was intentional, while his defence maintains it was an accident.Orange County superior court judge Jeffrey Ferguson, 74, was captured on police body-camera footage confessing to the shooting of his wife, Sheryl Ferguson , on August 3, 2023. ""I killed her,"" Ferguson is heard saying in the footage shown to jurors on Wednesday. ""I did it.""Prosecutor Seton Hunt told the court that Ferguson, who had been drinking that night, first argued with his wife over finances during dinner at a restaurant before the dispute continued at their home in Anaheim Hills. As the couple watched 'Breaking Bad' with their adult son, Ferguson allegedly made a gun-hand gesture toward Sheryl. She reportedly responded by telling him to point a real gun at her, after which Ferguson pulled out a loaded weapon from his ankle holster and shot her, Hunt said.Defence attorney Cameron J Talley does not dispute that Ferguson fired the gun but contends the shooting was not intentional. Ferguson, who has pleaded not guilty, is expected to testify later in the trial.After the shooting, both Ferguson and his son called 911. The judge also sent a message to his court clerk and bailiff, reading. ""I just lost it. I just shot my wife. I won't be in tomorrow. I will be in custody. I'm so sorry,"" according to prosecutors.Bodycam footage played in court showed Ferguson in handcuffs outside his home, swearing and asking officers if his wife was still alive. He is heard lamenting that his actions would cause his family to hate him and comparing himself to the violent criminals he once prosecuted.His son, Phillip Ferguson, testified that his father had previously taught him firearm safety, including the importance of never pointing a gun at someone. He said after the shooting, he jumped over a couch, took the gun from his father, and attempted to save his mother by performing CPR.""As I was jumping over the couch, I heard her say, 'He shot me,'"" Phillip recounted.Authorities later found 47 firearms and more than 26,000 rounds of ammunition in Ferguson's home. Prosecutors argue that his extensive experience with firearms contradicts any claim that the shooting was accidental.Ferguson, who was elected as an Orange County judge in 2012, was initially released on $1 million bail in 2023 but was re-arrested after violating his bail conditions by consuming alcohol. He was later freed again on a $2 million bond.A former prosecutor, Ferguson spent decades handling narcotics cases and received multiple awards for his work. However, his judicial career has not been without controversy—he was admonished in 2017 for making misleading statements about a judicial candidate on Facebook and maintaining social media friendships with attorneys who appeared before him in court.Under California law, a judge facing felony charges can continue receiving a salary but cannot preside over cases.","Orange County superior court judge Jeffrey Ferguson, 74, was captured on police body-camera footage confessing to the shooting of his wife.

We are bringing home four of our beloved hostages – fallen heroes.""The deaths of Shiri Bibas and her two young sons, Ariel, 5, and Kfir, 2, the youngest hostages held by Hamas, were described as ""heart-shattering"" by an Israeli group campaigning for hostage releases.Shiri’s husband, Yarden Bibas, was abducted separately on October 7, 2023, but was released on February 1 as part of a previous hostage-prisoner exchange.Hamas has claimed that Shiri Bibas and her two sons were killed in an Israeli air strike early in the war, though Israel has never confirmed this. The Bibas family had continued to hope they were still alive. ""We have held onto hope for 16 months, and we are not giving up now,"" wrote the boys' aunt, Ofri Bibas, on Facebook.Hamas has signalled a willingness to free all remaining hostages in a single swap during the next phase of the ceasefire. ""We have informed the mediators that Hamas is ready to release all hostages in one batch during the second phase of the agreement, rather than in stages as in the current first phase,"" said senior Hamas official Taher al-Nunu.The Israel-Hamas ceasefire has been in effect since January 19 and has so far led to the release of 19 Israeli hostages in exchange for over 1,100 Palestinian prisoners.The International Committee of the Red Cross, which has mediated the hostage exchanges, urged all sides to ensure a respectful transfer of the remains. ""We once again call for all releases to be conducted in a private and dignified manner, including when they tragically involve the deceased,"" the organisation said.On October 7, 2023, Hamas and its allies took 251 people hostage during an attack on Israel. Of these, 70 remain in Gaza, including 35 whom the Israeli military believes are dead.The attack resulted in the deaths of 1,211 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli figures.

Donald Trump administration tells Pentagon to slash budget by $290 billion in next five years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-administration-tells-pentagon-to-slash-budget-by-290-billion-in-next-five-years/articleshow/118399867.cms,"Post

The Donald Trump administration on Wednesday (local time) asked Pentagon to cut down its budget by 8% annually or by $290 billion withing the next five years.Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth directed the Pentagon to draft deep budget reductions, according to The Washington Post, which cited a memo on the matter.The Pentagon’s 2025 budget stands at approximately $850 billion, with bipartisan agreement among lawmakers that such substantial spending is necessary to counter global threats, particularly from China and Russia. However, if the proposed cuts are fully implemented, the budget would shrink by tens of billions annually, reaching around $560 billion within five years.While specifics on where the reductions would fall remain unclear, a previousreport suggested that junior civilian employees—not uniformed military personnel—were the primary targets.The move follows a visit to the Pentagon by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency last week and is expected to face strong opposition from both the military and Congress.With the Pentagon facing potential budget cuts, the US defense spending—currently around 3.4% of GDP—would move even further from the five percent threshold some policymakers have advocated.The news sent shockwaves through the defense sector, causing stock fluctuations among major US contractors. Lockheed Martin saw a brief dip before recovering, while Northrop Grumman dropped nearly two percent. Palantir took the hardest hit, closing down more than 10%.","The Pentagon’s 2025 budget stands at approximately $850 billion, with bipartisan agreement among lawmakers that such substantial spending is necessary to counter global threats.

Kamala Harris frontrunner in California Guv race



Former vice president Kamala Harris has finally signaled her next move as she signed with Hollywood talent agency Creative Artists Agency, the same one that recently roped in former president Joe Biden. This is not their first deal with the agency. Biden was represented by the agency before entering the White House and Kamala Harris too was represented by the same agency when she was California's senator.“CAA will work closely with Harris on her post-White House initiatives, creating strategic opportunities that expand her platform in support of the issues she has championed throughout her decades-long career in public service,” the Los Angeles-based company said, as reported by The Hill.The agency will represent Harris in all areas including speaking engagements and publishing indicating that the former vice president may publish a book soon.This is the same agency that represents former president Barack Obama, former first lady Michelle Obama, Beyonce, Brad Pitt, Ariana Grande and NBA star Devin Booker.Kamala Harris has not spelt out her next political moves but she is already a frontrunner in the California Guv race which she may not even enter. Current Guv Gavin Nesom cannot run again for the post because of the term limits. All eyes are on Kamala Harris because if she runs for the post, though it will be a step down from vice president, she will be a clear front-runner. ""Ms Harris has won California every time she's been on the statewide ballot -- as a candidate for president, vice president, senator and attorney general,"" the New York Times observed.""If Ms Harris does run, it would be a rare move for someone who came so close to the presidency.

His remarks come amid rising tensions between Washington and Kyiv, with Trump advocating for a swift end to the conflict while criticising European nations for their handling of the crisis.""Zelenskyy admits that half of the money we sent him is “MISSING.” He refuses to have Elections, is very low in Ukrainian Polls, and the only thing he was good at was playing Biden “like a fiddle.” A Dictator without Elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left,"" Trump wrote.Trump accused Zelenskyy of mismanaging the war and claimed that millions had ""unnecessarily died"" under his leadership. He also took a swipe at European countries, arguing that the conflict in Ukraine is ""far more important to Europe than it is to us.""

Despite Vatican assurances that his condition is stable, sources claim the Pontiff is in intense pain and is now fully reliant on medical intervention, according to a report by Politico.The Pope was admitted on February 14 after suffering from bronchitis for a week. Initially reluctant, he agreed to hospitalization after doctors warned he was at risk of death if he remained at the Vatican. A Vatican statement later confirmed he is undergoing extensive antibiotic treatment for a polymicrobial respiratory infection, compounded by his history of lung complications.Reports suggest Francis is now ""tying up loose ends,"" making key appointments to shape the Church’s future. Before his hospitalization, he controversially extended the term of Giovanni Battista Re as dean of the College of Cardinals, ensuring influence over the next papal election.Since his election in 2013, Francis has pushed for a more inclusive Church, a stance that has drawn both praise and criticism. His tenure has also seen efforts to combat clerical abuse, with mixed results.","Pope Francis, 88, is being treated for double-lung pneumonia at Rome's Gemelli hospital.

Aspiring candidates would have been making appearances. Donors would have begun bankrolling their favourites, and organisations would have started to announce endorsements. Instead, Kamala Harris came home.The former vice president , after a stinging defeat in the presidential race last year, has shaken up the 2026 governor's race by her mere presence in California. Speculation has grown each week since her return from Washington: Will she or won't she enter the race?After flying back to Los Angeles last month, Harris has stood with firefighters in Altadena, greeted evacuees at a Red Cross shelter and toured fire damage in Pacific Palisades. ""I am here, and would be here, regardless of the office I hold, because it's the right thing to do,"" Harris said when asked if she was running for governor.The possibility has made it difficult for most other Democrats to move forward, realising that any calculations they make now would be upended if Harris entered the race. The 2026 contest to replace Gov. Gavin Newsom , who cannot run again because of term limits, is currently populated by lesser-known aspirants, many of whom likely would step aside if Harris decided to run.""She hasn't frozen the field but definitely made it icy enough to force everyone to slow down and watch their step,"" said Democratic strategist Dan Newman. Harris is weighing whether to run for governor next year, run for president in 2028 or pursue a role outside of elected office, according to a person with knowledge of her deliberations. She has put together an advisory team that includes former White House staff, veteran Democratic strategists, policy experts, a speechwriter and fund-raiser.Running for governor might seem to be a step down for someone who served four years as the VP and was the Democratic nominee for president. But by doing so, Harris would avoid the competitive slog of a presidential primary and have a strong chance to lead the nation's most populous state with the help of fellow Democrats who control the legislature. Harris has won in California every time she's been on the statewide ballot - as the candidate for president, VP, senator and attorney general.The prospect of her entry seems to have energised Republicans, who believe competing against Harris, especially after her loss to President Trump, could energise their supporters and attract donations.If Harris does run, it would be a rare move for someone who came so close to the presidency. Only four VPs have run for governor, and one dropped out to support another candidate, according to Joel Goldstein, a law professor. nyt","Kamala Harris has shaken up the 2026 governor's race by her mere presence in California.

DENVER: Anne Marie Hochhalter , who was partially paralyzed in the Columbine High School shooting but found strength to forgive and to heal her soul after bonding with another family devastated by the tragedy, has died. She was 43.Hochhalter was found in her home in suburban Denver on Sunday. Her family suspects she died of natural causes stemming from her injuries in the 1999 shooting in which 12 students and a teacher were killed.The investigation into how she died has been transferred to the office that conducted the autopsies of those killed at Columbine, the coroner's office for Adams and Broomfield counties said.Hochhalter in 2016 wrote a letter to one of the gunmen's mothers saying, ""Bitterness is like swallowing a poison pill,"" and offering her forgiveness. Attending a vigil on the tragedy's 25th anniversary last year, after skipping a similar event five years earlier, she said she was flooded with happy memories from her childhood and wanted those killed remembered for how they lived, not how they died.Hochhalter struggled with intense pain from her gunshot wounds over the past 25 years. Yet her brother said she was tireless in her drive to help others- from people with disabilities to rescue dogs and members of her family.""She was helpful to a great many people. She was really a good human being and sister,"" her brother, Nathan Hochhalter , said Tuesday.Her own tragedy was compounded six months after the shooting, when her mother, Carla Hochhalter, went into a pawnshop, and asked to look at a gun before using it on herself.In the wake of her mother's death, Anne Marie Hochhalter was embraced by another family who lost a daughter at Columbine.Sue Townsend, whose stepdaughter , Lauren Townsend, was killed, reached out to help Hochhalter as a means of easing her own pain. At first, Townsend took Hochhalter to doctor's appointments and physical therapy, but their bond soon deepened as they got lunch and went shopping together and eventually began sharing family dinners and vacations.Townsend and her husband, Rick, called Hochhalter their ""acquired daughter.""On a trip to Hawaii together, Hochhalter, who used a wheelchair, was able to float in a lagoon pain-free, she said.""This relationship would never had happened if it hadn't been for Columbine. So I tried to focus on the gift that Columbine gave us in Anne Marie instead of what it took away,"" Townsend said.In 2016, the mother of one of the Columbine gunmen, Sue Klebold, released a memoir exploring the causes of her son's violence and ways to prevent future attacks through mental health awareness. Hochhalter said at the time she was grateful that Klebold was donating the book proceeds to help those with mental illness. Hochhalter said her mother suffered from depression and did not believe the shootings were directly to blame for her death.She said she was sure Klebold had agonized over what she could have done differently just as she had thought of ways she could have prevented the death of the mother she loved.""A good friend once told me, 'Bitterness is like swallowing a poison pill and expecting the other person to die.' It only harms yourself. I have forgiven you and only wish you the best,"" Hochhalter said in a message she posted on Facebook. She also included a photo of a card Sue and Tom Klebold sent to her as she recovered in the hospital after the shooting.Hochhalter attended the 25th anniversary vigil in April with her brother, who was trapped in a classroom during the shooting. She had not attended the 20th anniversary event because of post-traumatic stress disorder, she said in a social media post last year.""I've truly been able to heal my soul since that awful day in 1999,"" she wrote.",Anne Marie Hochhalter was partially paralyzed in the 1999 shooting.

At least seven passengers belonging to Pakistan’s Punjab province were shot dead late on Tuesday night in Barkhan district, in volatile southwestern Balochistan province.The incident occurred on a Balochistan-Punjab highway running through the Koh-e-Sulaiman mountain range. With 45 passengers on board, the bus was en route to Faisalabad from Quetta, Balochistan’s capital.A senior government official said the attackers burst the tyres of the bus on a highway close to the provincial border with Punjab. “Armed men stopped a Punjab-bound bus, with 45 people on board, on the Balochistan-Punjab highway and off-boarded seven Punjabi passengers after checking identification cards of those on board the bus,” Khadim Hussain, Barkhan’s assistant commissioner, said. “The commuters were lined up and shot dead,” Hussain said, adding the attack was carried out within 10 minutes and the attackers escaped into the Koh-e-Sulaiman mountains.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but ethnic Baloch separatists, who have carried out similar attacks in the past, are the most likely suspects. The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) is the most active organisation in the region and it usually targets security forces as well as Pakistanis from other provinces.At least 10 mine workers from northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province were killed in a roadside blast in Balochistan’s Harnai district. Last year, at least 39 people were killed after BLA militants forcibly removed ethnic Punjabi commuters from buses in the volatile province. The BLA also targets Chinese interests in the restive province, claiming that outsiders are exploiting resource-rich Balochistan while leaving the natives behind.","The incident occurred on a Balochistan-Punjab highway running through the Koh-e- Sulaiman mountain range.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) founder Imran Khan has ordered the expulsion of party members who were not present during the vote on the 26th Constitutional Amendment , except Zain Qureshi, The Express Tribune reported.Imran Khan ordered the senior leadership to issue formal notifications, expelling PTI members who were absent during the voting except Zain Qureshi. He has made it clear that those who were not present on a crucial constitutional amendment vote have no place in PTI.PTI founder also sent a message to the party's senior leadership, calling for action against the members who were absent without delay. Imran Khan-founded party has started issuing show-cause notices to those who did not participate during the voting.Zarqa Suharwardy, Senator Faisal Saleem and Zain Qureshi were among the lawmakers who were not present during the day of the amendment vote, The Express Tribune reported, citing PTI sources. PTI has already issued show-cause notice to Aslam Ghumman, Miqdar Ali Khan, Riaz Fatyana, Zain Qureshi, and Aurangzeb Kachhi.In addition, the party leadership was reportedly unable to contact PTI-backed lawmakers Zahoor Qureshi, Usman Ali, and Mubarak Zaib on the day of the vote. Considering these development, PTI founder has ordered the expulsion notification of all absent lawmakers, The Express Tribune reported.Earlier this week, Pakistan's Leader of Opposition in the National Assembly Omar Ayub has said that Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) will raise its concerns regarding the 2024 general elections and the 26th constitutional amendment with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) delegation, The Express Tribune reported.Ayub said, ""We will present the entire matter of the elections before the IMF delegation."" He said, ""We will also highlight the issues caused by the 26th amendment."" PTI leader Omar Ayub made the remarks as a six-member IMF delegation reached the Pakistan Supreme Court to hold a meeting with chief justice Yahya Afridi.Earlier in October, Imran Khan said that those who voted in favour of the controversial 26th constitutional amendment bill ""betrayed"" the nation. His remarks came after the National Assembly and Senate passed the bill with a two-thirds majority under which the term for the chief justice of Pakistan was set at three years, ARY News reported.During the interaction with reporters and his lawyers in a makeshift courtroom inside Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, former Pakistan PM Imran Khan alleged that he was being treated worse than animals in jail.""I want to clearly state that those who voted in favour of the 26th constitutional amendment betrayed Pakistan by destroying the very foundations of our Constitution,"" Imran Khan was quoted as saying in Adiala Jail in a post on X.Khan said that he would stand firmly for the ""genuine freedom"" of Pakistan despite the attempts to break his spirit through ""torture""He stated, ""I was tortured by being confined in a cage and treated worse than animals. This was an extremely vile act. The electricity in my cell was shut off for five days, leaving me in complete darkness. I was confined to the cell for ten days. For several weeks, any visits by family members, doctors, or lawyers were blocked. They want to break me through this torture and hardship, but I will stand firm for the genuine freedom of the Pakistnation.""Under the constitutional amendment, the term for the chief justice of Pakistan has been set at three years. A 12-member parliamentary committee will nominate the new chief justice of Pakistan from a panel of the three most senior judges, ARY News reported.As per the report, the committee, comprising eight members from the National Assembly and four from the Senate, will propose the name to the Prime Minister, who will then forward it to the President for final approval.A Judicial Commission of Pakistan, led by chief justice and including three senior judges, two members each from the National Assembly and Senate, Pakistan's federal minister for law and justice, the attorney general, and a nominee of the Pakistan Bar Council, having not less than 15 years of practice in the Supreme Court, will be responsible for appointments of the judges of the Supreme Court.",Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) founder Imran Khan has ordered the expulsion of party members who were not present during the vote on the 26th Constitutional Amendment.

ISLAMABAD: At least 10 people were killed and six injured a bomb planted by the road exploded as a pickup truck carrying coal mine workers went by in Harnai district of southwestern Balochistan province on Friday, officials said.Hazrat Wali Kakar, Harnai’s top civilian official, said the bomb was an improvised explosive device (IED). “Ten mining workers were killed in the attack,” Kakar said.Saleem Tareen, another local official, said most of the victims were from the country’s northwestern Swat Valley in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province. “The labourers were traveling to a market in Harnai,” he added. Harnai lies some 160 km east of Quetta, the capital of Balochistan province.Authorities said they were investigating the attack, with officials saying evidence was being collected and that preliminary investigation showed the explosive material had been planted on the roadside.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack yet. But the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), a militant organisation fighting for independence, is active in the restive province that borders Afghanistan and Iran. The group usually targets security forces as well as Pakistanis from other provinces. Local media reported that most of the workers killed or injured came from KP’s Puran village.The BLA has also targeted Chinese projects in the region, arguing that foreigners are exploiting resource-rich Balochistan while the impoverished residents are left behind.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif responded to the incident by reaffirming his commitment to aggressively working to eradicate terrorism in the country.",A bomb planted by the road exploded as a pickup truck carrying coal mine workers went by.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan denounced on Friday the reference against it in a joint India-US declaration, calling it “one-sided, misleading, and contrary to diplomatic norms”.The joint India-US statement called on Islamabad to expeditiously bring to justice the perpetrators of the 26/11 Mumbai attack and the Pathankot attack and ensure that its territory is not used to carry out cross-border terrorist attacks.“We consider the Pakistan-specific reference in the Indo-US joint statement on February 13, 2025 as one-sided, misleading and contrary to diplomatic norms ,” foreign office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan said at a weekly press briefing.“We are surprised that the reference has been added to the joint statement notwithstanding Pakistan’s counterterrorism cooperation with the US,” Khan said. “Such references cannot cover up India’s sponsorship of terrorism, subversion and extrajudicial assassinations in the region and beyond, nor can they shift international attention from the stark reality of India being a safe haven for the perpetrators of hate crimes against Muslims and other minorities,” the FO spokesperson said.“Pakistan is also deeply concerned over the planned transfer of military technology to India. Such steps accentuate military imbalances in the region and undermine strategic stability. They remain unhelpful in achieving durable peace in South Asia,” Khan said.“We urge our international partners to take a holistic and objective view of issues of peace and security in South Asia and refrain from endorsing positions that are one-sided and divorced from ground realities,” he said.","The joint India-US statement called on Islamabad to expeditiously bring to justice the perpetrators of the 26/11 Mumbai attack and the Pathankot attack. “We consider the Pakistan-specific reference in the Indo-US joint statement on February 13, 2025 as one-sided, misleading and contrary to diplomatic norms,” foreign office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118257401,imgsize-34754,width-400,resizemode-4/118257401.jpg"

The ministry said its embassy in Tripoli had “dispatched a team” to a local hospital at the site near Marsa Dela port for the identification.Late Tuesday, the ministry disclosed that of the 63 Pakistanis on the boat, the bodies of 16 had been fished out and 37 rescued, while 10 were still missing. “Three of the survivors are in Tripoli, being looked after by the (Pakistani) embassy,” the ministry said in a statement.The tragedy unfolded less than a month after 50 Pakistanis died when a boat with 86 migrants to Europe capsized off Morocco on January 16. Before that, at least 300 Pakistanis had drowned in a migrant boat that sank off Greece in June 2023, with Italy their intended destination.In a travel alert, Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has identified Libya as one of 15 transit countries used for human trafficking.Each year, thousands of Pakistanis pay traffickers large sums for risky and illegal journeys to Europe, hoping to find work and send money back to their families. Many also take these perilous routes to escape conflicts and religious persecution.Pakistani authorities claim human smugglers send migrants seeking illegal entry into Europe to Libya, located around 300km from Italy. From there, they either take them by boat to Europe or relocate them to the coastal cities of Morocco and Mauritania in west Africa.On Monday, UN’s International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said it was “deeply alarmed” by the dozens of migrants’ bodies found in mass graves in southeastern Libya. Two days back, Libyan authorities claimed they had found the bodies of 28 sub-Saharan migrants in the southeastern district of Kufra, near a site where they were allegedly detained and tortured.The UN agency expressed shock at the discovery of two mass graves in Libya with bodies of dozens of migrants, some with gunshot wounds.

ISLAMABAD: At least 16 Pakistanis died and 10 others are unaccounted for after a boat carrying dozens of Europe-bound migrants sank at the weekend off the coast of Libya , officials said Tuesday.The ministry of foreign affairs said that 33 of the 37 survivors were in Libyan police custody and one was being treated at a hospital. An estimated 65 people were on the boat, it said.Prime minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed his deep grief and sorrow for those lost in the capsizing in Marsa Dela port in the western city of Zawiya.Sharif ordered the foreign ministry to complete the process of identifying the victims and provide assistance to those affected. He also ordered action against those involved ""in heinous acts like human trafficking,"" according to a statement.Most of the victims came from Kurram, a district in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan , where hundreds of people have been killed in recent years in sectarian clashes.""People try to travel to Europe through illegal means because of unemployment"" at home, said Javed Hussain, a nephew of Shehzad Hussain, one of the victims. He said mourners were gathering at the homes of those who perished in the latest tragedy.In January, authorities said dozens of Pakistanis died when a boat capsized off West Africa. Some of the survivors later accused smugglers of killing 43 migrants in a dispute over payment. Pakistan has since confirmed the deaths of 13 of its nationals.Hundreds of Pakistanis die every year while trying to reach Europe by land and sea with the help of human smugglers. They also use dangerous land and sea routes to reach Europe in an effort to find jobs.Libya, which has borders with six nations and a long shore on the Mediterranean, was plunged into chaos following a Nato-backed uprising that toppled and killed longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. Since then, the oil-rich country has emerged as the dominant transit point for migrants fleeing war and poverty in Africa and the Middle East for Europe.At least 674 migrants were reported dead and more than 1,000 missing off Libya in 2024, according to the International Organization for Migration's missing migrants project. More than 21,700 migrants were intercepted and returned to the chaos-stricken country.In 2023, the IOM reported 962 migrants dead and 1,563 missing off Libya. Around 17,200 migrants were intercepted and returned to Libya that year, it said.Those who are returned are held in government-run detention centers rife with abuses, including forced labor, beatings, rapes and torture - practices that amount to crimes against humanity, according to UN-commissioned investigators. The abuse often accompanies attempts to extort money from the families of the imprisoned migrants before releasing them or allowing them to leave Libya on traffickers' boats to Europe.","At least 16 Pakistanis died and 10 others are unaccounted for after a boat carrying dozens of Europe-bound migrants sank off Libya.

Pakistani lawyers stage protest against high-level meeting of constitutional body to pick eight SC judges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistani-lawyers-stage-protest-against-high-level-meeting-of-constitutional-body-to-pick-eight-sc-judges/articleshow/118118105.cms,"Representative image (Image credits: ANI)

ISLAMABAD: Hundreds of lawyers on Monday staged protests in Pakistan's national capital against a high-level meeting of a constitutional body with the agenda to appoint at least eight judges of the supreme court. The judicial commission of Pakistan (JCP) meeting was being held despite opposition by four apex court judges, the legal fraternity, resistance by opposition the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf and controversy over the recent transfer of judges to the Islamabad high court (IHC), which was opposed by five IHC judges.The JCP, a top body empowered to approve judicial appointments, will finalise appointments for eight vacant supreme court judges.Lawyers gathered at various locations in Islamabad, with the lawyers' action committee staging a protest near D-Chowk. But police responded by closing several key entry points to the Red Zone, which houses key buildings, including the supreme court.Dozens of protestors gathered at Serena Chowk as they were stopped from going to the supreme court due to the closure of the Red Zone. They chanted ""Azaadi"" (freedom) and ""Lawyers' unity zindabad"" (long live lawyers' unity). They were also holding a banner written in Urdu and reading "" 26th constitutional amendment unacceptable"".Clashes were also reported between lawyers and police when they tried to enter the Red Zone. However, there was no report of any arrest or injury during the protest.The protest led to the suspension of metro bus services on multiple routes between Islamabad and Rawalpindi, causing significant inconvenience for commuters. The closure of the Red Zone has caused traffic disruptions, leading to heavy congestion on different roads in the capital.Earlier, the legal fraternity in the country was already expressing concerns against the new appointments and transfers following the controversial 26th constitutional amendment passed last year.The lawyers' representatives had held a convention at the Islamabad district courts, opposing the 26th amendment and demanding the cancellation of the JCP meeting.They also announced on February 3 to protest against the transfer of three high court judges to the IHC but it could not elicit a widespread response. The Karachi bar association had supported the strike call by staying away.Last month, the Lahore high court bar association (LHCBA) moved an application before the apex court through advocate Muhammad Waqar Rana, seeking postponement of the JCP meeting.The JCP earlier this month asked all high courts to send a list of five senior judges from each for consideration for the appointment of eight of them to the supreme court.Initially, the IHC had forwarded the names of three judges - chief justice Aamer Farooq, justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani and justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb - to the JCP because justices Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri and Babar Sattar did not meet the minimum requirement of five years of service.However, as justice Sarfraz Dogar was made the IHC senior puisne judge following his transfer there from the Lahore high court, his name has also been sent to the JCP.Days before justice Dogar's name was added, five judges of the IHC approached chief justice Yahya Afridi and IHC chief justice Aamer Farooq to reclaim their seniority.Separately, four SC judges, senior puisne judge justice Mansoor Ali Shah, justice Munib Akhtar, justice Ayesha Malik and justice Athar Minallah, in a letter to the chief justice showed concerns last week and are also seeking the postponement of today's JCP session until a decision is made on the petitions against the 26th Amendment.The opposition PTI party in a letter to the chief justice on Sunday asked to postpone the commission's meeting.The 13-member JCP is led by the chief justice and includes four judges of the apex court, as well as parliamentarians from both the treasury and opposition and others.The lawyers and opposition allege that the government was trying to 'pack' the top judiciary with hand-picked judges to influence the fate of political cases, a concern rejected by the government.","Hundreds of lawyers stage protests in Islamabad against high-level meeting of constitutional body.

What was written in OHCHR report?



Deposed Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina blamed Bangladesh's interim government leader Muhammad Yunus for the country's ""lawlessness"" and vowed to return back to her country.During a one-on-one interaction on Zoom with widows of four policemen killed during last July’s student uprising, Hasina claimed Yunus has ""unleashed terrorists"" on its citizens, PTI news agency reported.Hasina's 16-year Awami League administration ended following a student uprising on August 5, 2024, forcing her to seek refuge in India.Hasina said, ""He (Yunus) dissolved all inquiry committees and unleashed terrorists to butcher people. They are destroying Bangladesh.""The conversation, which surfaced on social media on Tuesday, showed Hasina comforting grieving family members whilst expressing her intention to return and seek justice for the fallen officers.""I will return and avenge the deaths of our policemen,"" she declared, noting that she had narrowly escaped death during her government's collapse, attributing her survival to divine intervention ""to do something good.""""Yunus has no experience in running a government,"" the former prime minister stated, adding, ""We need to put an end to this lawlessness.""In previous social media appearances, Hasina accused Yunus of orchestrating ""a long, and well-designed plot to oust her government and grab the state power.""Meanwhile, the office of Bangladesh's interim government said on Tuesday that securing the extradition of Sheikh Hasina from India was their top priority.""This is the government's top priority,"" chief adviser Yunus' press secretary Shafiqul Alam said during a media briefing that the administration would persist in its attempts to bring Hasina back for a personal trial.During the briefing, he indicated that whilst the Bangladeshi public and political organisations would determine the future of her ""fascist"" Awami League, individuals allegedly responsible for killings, forced disappearances and other offences must face legal consequences.The spokesperson referenced the Office of the united nations high commissioner for human rights' (OHCHR) fact-finding report from the previous week, which indicated Hasina's involvement in crimes against humanity during her leadership.According to the state-run Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS), he noted that following the publication of UN and human rights organisations' reports, there was increased pressure for India to return Hasina to Bangladesh.The UN human rights office (OHCHR) issued a report last week detailing the unrest in Bangladesh that resulted in approximately 1,400 fatalities. The report was titled 'Human Rights Violations and Abuses related to the Protests of July and August 2024 in Bangladesh'.The document examined events from July 1 to August 15, encompassing student protests demanding Hasina's removal and subsequent attacks on Awami League supporters and minority groups, including Hindus.The findings revealed that the Awami League administration under Hasina responded with severe measures against protesters, resulting in ""hundreds of extrajudicial killings.""Police headquarters, now substantially reorganised under the interim administration, confirmed that a minimum of 44 police personnel, including officers, lost their lives during the upheaval.The UN report indicated that 450 of the nation's 639 police stations suffered destruction or damage from mob violence during the period surrounding the Awami League government's collapse.""After Sheikh Hasina left the country on August 5 last year, revenge violence surged,"" stated the OHCHR report, noting that violent groups attacked and set fire to numerous police facilities.The UN rights office reported that in numerous instances, police personnel either abandoned their posts or received permission to leave from their commanders, whilst in other situations, officers faced mob violence resulting in their deaths.","Deposed Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina blames interim government leader Muhammad Yunus for the country's ""lawlessness"" Hasina's 16-year Awami League administration ended following a student uprising on August 5, 2024, forcing her to seek refuge in India. Yunus' press secretary said the administration would persist in its attempts to bring Hasina back for a personal trial.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118366281,imgsize-27424,width-400,resizemode-4/118366281.jpg"
41 former police officers arrested in Bangladesh for committing atrocities during student-led protests last year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/41-former-police-officers-arrested-in-bangladesh-for-committing-atrocities-during-student-led-protests-last-year/articleshow/118327236.cms,"Former Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina

DHAKA: Police in Bangladesh have arrested 41 former officers who are among 1,059 ex-policemen accused of committing atrocities during the 2024 student-led movement that led to the ouster of prime minister Sheikh Hasina, officials and media reports said on Monday.Hasina, the Awami League leader, resigned and escaped to India on August 5 last year after anti-discrimination student protests against the quota system turned into a movement and ousted her 16-year regime from power. Some 1,400 people lost their lives during the protests between July and August.The mass circulation Prothom Alo newspaper, quoting unnamed police headquarters (PHQ) officials, said surviving victims of the atrocities or the family members of the slain victims lodged hundreds of cases with police stations and court accusing the 1,059 officials of the main law enforcement agency.Police have arrested 41 former officers so far.The PHQ said police's two former inspectors general (IGP) Chowdhury Abdullah Al Mamun and AKN Shahidul Haque and former police commissioners of Dhaka and the southeastern port city of Chattogram Mohammad Asaduzzaan and Mian Saiful Islam were among those who were arrested so far.Other than Haq, these officers were serving until Hasina departed from the country.The highest number of 174 cases were filed against Dhaka Metropolitan Police 's now fugitive former additional commissioner Harunur Rashid.Arrested former IGP Al Mamun faces 159 cases.The officials said several senior officers including additional police chiefs and a police commissioner were on the run while some of them were believed to have fled the country.Bangladesh is currently governed by an interim government led by Muhammad Yunus, whom the anti-discrimination students movement appointed as chief advisor.Incumbent inspector general of police Baharul Alam earlier said the cases filed over the July-August uprising would be investigated under committees led by senior police officers in each of eight police ranges across Bangladesh.The UN rights office which last week released a fact-finding report on the 2024 violence in Bangladesh reviewed the police and other security forces' role, saying they used force causing ""systematic and widespread extrajudicial killings as part of a coordinated strategy of repression"".The office of the high commissioner for human rights (OHCHR) said the vast majority of the people killed in violence during the uprising were shot by Bangladesh's security forces.""Based on the material before it, OHCHR has reasonable grounds to believe that police and paramilitary state security forces resorted to use of force violations against protesters, including systematic and widespread extrajudicial killings as part of a coordinated strategy of repression,"" it read.It said the security forces tried to disperse disruptive ""yet peaceful assemblies with 'disproportionate force', in particular by shooting military rifles and shotguns loaded with lethal metal pellets"" while in some cases ""deliberately killed or maimed defenceless protesters by shooting them at point-blank range"".","Police in Bangladesh have arrested 41 former officers who are among 1,059 ex- policemen.

Taliban's security challenges

One killed and three others suffered injuries in a suicide attack on Afghan ministry of urban development and housing on Thursday.""The suicide attacker wanted to enter the ministry and one of the mujahideen (security forces) shot him and then in the result of the explosion another person near him was killed and three injured,"" interior ministry spokesman Abdul Mateen Qani told AFP.Although violence in Afghanistan has significantly decreased since the Taliban reclaimed power in 2021, the Islamic State (IS) group continues to launch deadly attacks challenging their rule. IS has previously targeted Taliban officials, foreign diplomats, and civilians in Afghanistan.A doctor at Kabul's Emergency Hospital, speaking anonymously, said that ""five to six injured"" individuals had been brought to the facility for treatment. However, official casualty figures often differ from those reported by medical personnel on the ground.There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Thursday's attack, but IS has a history of carrying out high-profile bombings in Afghanistan. In December, the group claimed responsibility for a suicide attack that killed Khalil Ur-Rahman Haqqani, the Taliban government's minister for refugees, inside his Kabul office. Just a day before Thursday's attack, IS also claimed responsibility for a deadly assault on a northern Afghan bank, which left eight people dead. The attack specifically targeted Taliban employees collecting their salaries.IS-Khorasan, the Afghan chapter of the Islamic State founded in 2015, has been behind some of the deadliest attacks in the country. The group gained global attention in August 2021 when it bombed Kabul airport during the chaotic US evacuation, killing around 170 Afghans and 13 American service members.Since taking power, the Taliban government has declared security its highest priority, claiming success in curbing IS activities through an extensive crackdown. However, IS remains a persistent threat, continuing to target government officials and civilians alike.Security forces frequently seal off attack sites, making independent verification of casualty figures difficult. The Taliban maintains that its counterterrorism measures have weakened IS, but Thursday's bombing highlights the ongoing security challenges the administration faces.","One killed and three others injured in suicide attack on Afghan ministry of urban development and housing.

UN reports rights abuses in B'desh 2024 protest response, estimates 1,400 killed

DHAKA: A UN report released on Wednesday found that human rights abuses were inflicted on members of Bangladesh's Hindu, Ahmadiyya Muslim and indigenous communities during the anti-discrimination protests that led to Sheikh Hasina govt's fall and its aftermath in 204.While 100 arrests related to attacks on distinct religious & indigenous groups have reportedly been made, perpetrators of many other acts of revenge violence and targeted attacks on such groups still enjoy impunity, UN Human Rights Office said. After fall of the govt, ""widespread attacks were reported against Hindu homes, businesses and places of worship"", it said. The report validates India's repeated claims of targeted attacks on Hindus & temples.Widespread attacks were reported against Hindu homes, businesses, and places of worship, especially in rural and historically tense areas such as Thakurgaon, Lalmonirhat and Dinajpur, as well as other places such as Sylhet, Khulna, and Rangpur"", said the UN report titled 'Human Rights Violations and Abuses related to Protests of July and August 2024 in Bangladesh'.These destructions were especially prevalent in areas perceived to be sympathetic to the Awami League as Hindus have often been stereotypically associated with this political faction, it added. The report, based on the deaths reported by various credible sources, also estimated that as many as 1,400 people may have been killed during July 1-Aug 15 last year and thousands were injured, the vast majority of whom were shot by Bangladesh's security forces.""Bangladesh's former govt, security and intelligence services, alongside violent elements associated with Awami League, systematically engaged in a range of serious human rights violations during last year's student-led protests,"" it added.Former PM Sheikh Hasina left the country on Aug 5 and Muhammad Yunus-led interim govt began its journey three days later. The report released by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights documented ""troubling instances"" of retaliatory killings and revenge violence during the student-led protests. It stated that security and intelligence services ""systematically engaged"" in rights violations that could amount to crimes against humanity.UN Human Rights chief Volker Turk described the response as a ""calculated and well-coordinated strategy"" by the Hasina govt to retain power amid mass opposition. ""Hundreds of extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrests, detentions, and torture"" were carried out with political leadership's knowledge and coordination, he added.Director of Rights and Risks Analysis Group (RRAG) Suhas Chakma criticised the report for not identifying individual officers responsible for the carnage, citing the limitations of Yunus's interim govt, which restricted the investigation period from July 5 to Aug 15, 2024.The report also includes recommendations to reform Bangladesh's security and justice sectors. ""The interim govt must ensure that violent crimes targeting supporters of Awami League, police officers, or members of distinct religious and indigenous groups are promptly and independently investigated with due diligence and that identified perpetrators are brought to justice,"" it said.","UN reports rights abuses in B'desh 2024 protest response, estimates 1,400 killed. 100 arrests related to attacks on distinct religious & indigenous groups have reportedly been made. perpetrators of many other acts of revenge violence and targeted attacks on such groups still enjoy impunity.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118196706,imgsize-566875,width-400,resizemode-4/118196706.jpg"
County Durham: CCTV footage captures 'instant karma' as drug-fuelled thief crashes stolen bike in high-speed chase,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/watch-cctv-footage-captures-instant-karma-as-drug-fuelled-thief-crashes-stolen-bike-in-high-speed-chase/articleshow/118375428.cms,"Stolen bike and jail time

A motorbike thief got a dose of ‘ instant karma ’ when he was flung off a stolen bike during a high-speed police chase in County Durham , Daily Mail reported.Ciaran Parker , 20, was racing through Pelton on a stolen Kawasaki 300 when police signalled him to stop at around 10.30am on April 2 last year. Instead of pulling over, Parker—who was not wearing a helmet—sped up, hitting dangerous speeds of 60mph in a 30mph zone.Dashcam footage captured Parker hurtling across junctions, swerving onto the wrong side of the road, and weaving through Chester-le-Street town centre. At one point, he narrowly missed a bus before finally losing control and crashing at 40mph.CCTV captured shocked onlookers watching the crash from different angles. A mother quickly pulled her children away as Parker and the bike slid towards them. A young boy nearby was hurt by flying debris.Bodycam footage captured officers approaching Parker, who lay on the ground, bleeding and crying out in pain.“I need some painkillers!” he sobbed, before quickly adding, “Right, I know exactly what you're gonna say, but I’ve just bought the f***ing bike man!”An officer responded, “Ciaran, at the minute I couldn’t care less about that. My main concern is whatever injuries you’ve got.”Parker had suffered an open fracture in his right leg, and blood soaked the back of his head. As paramedics applied a tourniquet to his shattered limb, he screamed in agony: “I’m in a bad way here. My ankle! My leg’s knacking!”When asked by officers if he had taken drugs, Parker denied it, shouting: “No man! Get off my f***ing head!” However, tests later confirmed he had both cocaine and cannabis in his system.Investigations revealed the Kawasaki had been stolen from a home in Stanley at around 1.20am that same day. Parker was charged with multiple offences, including burglary, aggravated vehicle taking, dangerous driving , drug driving , driving without a licence, and driving without insurance.He pleaded guilty at Durham Crown Court and was sentenced to 14 months in a Young Offender Institution.In a police interview, Parker was shown footage of the crash. Cringing at the sight, he said, “I don’t even want to watch that.”He added: “I bought that bike, you know?” before quickly shutting down the questioning with, “Aw listen – no comment. You’re wasting my time.”Detective constable Michelle Leonard said Parker’s reckless riding could have ended in tragedy.“This was an incredibly dangerous piece of riding,” she said. “He rode recklessly at very high speeds through residential areas, often on the wrong side of the road, before crashing the bike in the middle of a busy town centre. It is a miracle nobody was seriously injured or, worse, killed.”DC Leonard welcomed Parker’s 14-month sentence, saying, “I hope it sends a clear message that driving dangerously, without a licence, and under the influence of drugs can have catastrophic consequences and that those who choose to do it will be brought to justice.”","Ciaran Parker, 20, was racing through Pelton on a stolen Kawasaki 300 when police signalled him to stop at around 10.30am on April 2 last year.
