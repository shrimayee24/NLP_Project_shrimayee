Tensions are boiling over at college campuses across the country as police move in to break up protest encampments, clear out occupied buildings, and make arrests. The demonstrations have turned violent at some schools, with clashes erupting between pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli demonstrators.At campuses from New York to Dallas and Washington, DC, demonstrators are demanding schools sever financial ties to Israel and grant amnesty to students for rule breaking, among other goals.The showdowns have sparked recriminations and support from politicians, faculty and billionaire donors.With commencement quickly approaching, the pressure on administrators is on. Their strategies have varied from heavy handed to hands-off. Here’s a look at the latest developments at several institutions across the country.On Wednesday morning, dozens of protesters pushed their way into the Lincoln Center campus and set up tents. After repeated warnings, the NYPD arrested 15 people for trespassing and cleared out the encampment.Police arrested about 35 people, including students and professors, who had taken over two buildings. The school on Wednesday announced the campus will remain closed through at least the end of the semester and that a “modified” graduation ceremony will be held at an off-campus location.UCLA suspended classes on Wednesday after early morning unrest at a pro-Palestinian encampment, according to the Los Angeles Times. The newspaper said a group of counter-demonstrators tried to tear down the barricades surrounding the protest area. Pro-Palestinian protesters later used pepper spray on those demonstrators, it said.The college is moving to remote learning, after New York police descended on the campus late Tuesday night, clearing an encampment and arresting more than 160 people.Police officers entered the campus Tuesday, breaking up an escalating protest and arresting more than 100 demonstrators, some of whom had barricaded themselves in a building. Columbia President Minouche Shafik said she asked police to maintain a campus presence through at least May 17, two days after graduation.After the school issued a “no trespass order” to students at an encampment, President Sunil Kumar was scheduled to meet with protesters on Wednesday, the Tufts Daily newspaper reported.On Tuesday morning, officers from Yale and New Haven evacuated the pro-Palestine protest site at Campus Cross, according to Yale Daily News. Police were able to clear the encampment without arrests, though protesters vowed to return.Protesters at the Ivy League school agreed to dismantle their encampment after striking a deal that allows them to present their divestment proposal to the university’s governing body. The administration agreed that protesting students won’t be subject to suspension or expulsion.Thirteen people were arrested on Monday after hundreds of students took over a university building and erected barricades. Protesters surrounded the bus carrying the arrested students until they were released.One week into the campus demonstrations, lawmaker visited the site, including House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, who said Congress will do everything in its power to restore “law and order.”More than a dozen protesters were arrested on Wednesday afternoon after law enforcement broke up an encampment that pro-Palestinian students set up in the early morning hours, where hundreds of people had gathered, according to the Dallas Morning News.Administrators haven’t sought to clear out an encampment on Harvard Yard, instead threatening sanctions and restricting access, according to the Harvard Crimson. Final exams initially scheduled for Harvard Hall are being relocated outside Harvard Yard.","Protesters are demanding schools sever financial ties to Israel and grant amnesty to students for rule breaking.

US accuses Russia of using 'chemical weapon' in Ukraine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-accuses-russia-of-using-chemical-weapon-in-ukraine/articleshow/109768376.cms,"WASHINGTON: The US State Department accused Russia Wednesday of having used a chemical weapon against Ukrainian forces in violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention, while also announcing fresh sanctions against Moscow.In addition to the chemical agent chloropicrin , Russia also used ""riot control agents (tear gas) as a method of warfare in Ukraine , also in violation of the CWC,"" the department said in a factsheet.""The use of such chemicals is not an isolated incident, and is probably driven by Russian forces' desire to dislodge Ukrainian forces from fortified positions and achieve tactical gains on the battlefield,"" the State Department said.Meanwhile the US Treasury Department announced sweeping sanctions aimed at crippling Russia's military and industrial capabilities -- including targeting nearly 300 entities in Russia, China and other countries accused of supporting President Vladimir Putin's invasion.The sanctions are meant to punish companies that help Moscow acquire weapons for its war in Ukraine. They also target Russian government entities and companies involved in the country's chemical and biological weapons programs.Russia has said it no longer possesses a military chemical arsenal, but the country faces pressure for more transparency over the alleged use of toxic weapons.According to the US National Institutes of Health, the chemical chloropicrin is used both as a warfare agent and pesticide. If inhaled, it poses a health risk.- 'Sand in the gears' -""Today's actions will further disrupt and degrade Russia's war efforts by going after its military industrial base and the evasion networks that help supply it,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement.The accusations and sanctions come a week after US President Joe Biden signed a much-delayed bill to provide new funding for Ukraine as Kyiv's military struggles to hold back Russian advances.""Even as we're throwing sand in the gears of Russia's war machine, President (Joe) Biden's recently-passed National Security Supplemental is providing badly-needed military, economic, and humanitarian support to bolster Ukraine's courageous resistance,"" Yellen said.""Combined, our support for Ukraine and our relentless targeting of Russia's military capacity is giving Ukraine a critical leg-up on the battlefield.""As part of the measures, the State Department blacklisted additional individuals and companies involved in Moscow's energy, mining and metals sectors.The sanctions also targeted individuals connected to the death of Russian opposition leader Aleksey Navalny who died in a Siberian prison in February.The almost 300 targets sanctioned included dozens of actors accused of enabling Russia to acquire desperately needed technology and equipment from abroad, the Treasury said.Some of those targeted were based in countries such as China that have faced increasing pressure from Washington over support for Russia during its 15-month invasion of Ukraine.""This support enables Russia to continue its war against Ukraine and poses a significant threat to international security,"" the Treasury Department said.Other than China, targeted non-Russian entities were located in Azerbaijan, Belgium, Slovakia, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates.These companies ""enable Russia to acquire desperately-needed technology and equipment from abroad,"" the statement said.","US State Department accuses Russia of using a chemical weapon against Ukrainian forces.

US officials say they hope a temporary ceasefire would lead to a permanent one. On Tuesday, Netanyahu said that he plans a major assault on Rafah ""with or without"" a deal.The ceasefire talks have been stalled for months, and Israeli officials said Monday that they had agreed to lower their demands. They are now asking Hamas to free 33 civilians - women, older people and those who need urgent medical care - rather than 40.The proposed deal was one of the issues that Blinken discussed with President Isaac Herzog of Israel on Wednesday at a hotel in Tel Aviv.Before the meeting with Herzog started, Blinken told the president and reporters that discussions must focus on both a ceasefire that ""brings the hostages home"" and on getting more aid into Gaza. ""There is a proposal on the table, and as we've said, no delays, no excuses,"" Blinken said. Herzog said that the hostages' release should be a priority for the international community. After his talk with Herzog, Blinken met with a few family members of American hostages held in Gaza and then got into a motorcade to head to Jerusalem, where he entered a private meeting with Netanyahu. Blinken and other US officials say Hamas has a narrow window to take the deal since Netanyahu is pressing for the offensive in Rafah. When asked about Netanyahu's statements on Rafah, Blinken said that US efforts were focused on a hostage and ceasefire deal.","US secretary of state Antony Blinken met with PM Netanyahu in Israel on Wednesday.

At the University of Arizona, campus police sprayed chemicals as they broke up a demonstration. Other protest encampments around the country were still standing. Some demonstrators have said that they will not back down, posing a challenge for university administrators who want to protect free speech rights while minimising campus disruption.The clashes at UCLA erupted as counter-protesters tried to pull down parade barricades, plywood and wooden pallets protecting a tent encampment built by pro-Palestinian protesters. Video showed fireworks exploding over and in the encampment. People threw chairs and other objects. Some screamed pro-Jewish comments as pro-Palestinian protesters tried to fight them off.After a couple of hours of scuffles between pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli demonstrators at UCLA, police wearing helmets and face shields slowly separated the groups and quelled the violence. The scene was calm as day broke. Authorities have not detailed injuries. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass called the violence ""absolutely abhorrent and inexcusable"".At Columbia, New York City police officers entered campus after the university requested help. They cleared a tent encampment, along with Hamilton Hall where a stream of officers used a ladder to climb through a second-floor window. Protesters had seized the Ivy League school building about 20 hours earlier. Police loaded dozens of detainees onto a bus, their hands bound behind their backs by zip-ties, the scene illuminated with the flashing red and blue lights of police vehicles. The police action happened on the 56th anniversary of a similar move to quash the occupation of Hamilton Hall by students protesting racism and Vietnam War.University Prez Minouche Shafik asked police to stay on campus until at least May 17 - two days after graduation. Shafik said the occupiers had vandalised property. Mayor Adams blamed the Columbia protest on outside agitators. Pressed, however, about identities of the ""outside agitators"" cited by the mayor, officials repeatedly declined to provide details.On Wednesday, over 100 people, most identifying themselves as Columbia faculty, marched near the campus, chanting slogans, including ""How many kids did you arrest today?""Blocks away from Columbia, at City College of New York, demonstrators were in a standoff with police outside the public college's main gate. Video posted online by reporters late Tuesday showed officers forcing some people to the ground and shoving others as they cleared the street and sidewalks.More than 1,300 protesters have been taken into custody on US campuses since 108 were arrested at Columbia on April 18, according to a tally by NYT.Officials at Portland State University in Oregon urged protesters to leave a library that they had occupied. The police also moved into an encampment at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, arresting 30 people, but protesters returned later in the day.(With inputs from NYT and AP)","Police officers from New York to Los Angeles entered campuses where pro- Palestinian demonstrators had erected encampments and seized academic buildings.

The militant group said in a statement posted on its Telegram website late on Tuesday that one of its members attacked a ""Shiite temple"" in Herat province with machine-gun fire.The attack, which took place on Monday night in the district of Guzara, also left one person wounded.The attacker fled the scene. The Taliban Interior Ministry has said that an investigation is underway.Local media reported that the mosque's imam was among those killed. The UN mission in Afghanistan condemned the attack, saying a child was among the victims. It called for urgent accountability for perpetrators and protection measures for Shiite communities.Afghanistan's former President Hamid Karzai said on the social media platform X that he considered""this terrorist act against all religious and human standards.""Pakistan's foreign affairs ministry said on Wednesday that ""the people and government of Pakistan extend their heartfelt condolences to the people of Afghanistan.""""Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families in this hour of grief,"" it said.The statement added that Pakistan condemns terrorism in all its forms.The IS affiliate in Afghanistan is a major Taliban rival and frequently targets schools, hospitals, mosques and Shiite areas throughout the country.The Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in August 2021, during the last weeks of the chaotic departure of US and Nato troops from the country after 20 years of war.Despite initial promises of a more moderate stance, the Taliban gradually reimposed a harsh interpretation of Islamic law, or Shariah, as they did during their previous rule of Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001.","Islamic State group claims responsibility for deadly shooting at mosque in Afghanistan.

Police say two people have been detained during the investigation but no charges related to overdoses had been filed as of Wednesday.Fitzgerald said officers administered an overdose-reversing drug, naloxone, at the scene of several cases as they awaited emergency services. He added that citizen bystanders in some cases stepped in to administer the life-saving drug themselves, and thanked them for intervening.According to Travis County Judge Andy Brown, the county's top elected official, kits for administering overdose antidote drug naloxone during emergency situations were distributed to locals in affected areas and training was provided by emergency personnel for those willing to carry the medication.Brown said that the drug, which combats overdoses, had previously been proactively distributed across the area through city and county programs that attempt to fight increasing opioid overdoses. He said the efforts are conducted in coordination with local groups that often respond to overdose crisis.It is the largest overdose outbreak in Austin since a synthetic drug referred to as K2 was distributed locally in 2015, Brown said.",Health officials are calling the city's worst overdose outbreak in nearly a decade.

"US: Active shooter ‘neutralized’ outside Wisconsin school, officials say amid reports of gunshots, panic",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-active-shooter-neutralized-outside-wisconsin-school-officials-say/articleshow/109763572.cms,"Witnesses described children fleeing after the sound of gunshots near a Wisconsin middle school where authorities said an active shooter was “neutralized” outside the building Wednesday. There were no reported injuries to those inside the school.But police remained on the scene hours later, and Mount Horeb Area School District had only announced plans to release younger students from a nearby elementary school.In a post on Facebook, the district said remaining students would stay in schools “while the police continue their investigation.”For panicked kids and their parents, the initial incident and the wait to be reunited was terrifying. Parents described children hiding in closets, afraid to communicate on cell phones, and one middle schooler said his class initially fled the school gym on in-line skates.The district used Facebook posts throughout the day to give updates, with the earliest coming around 11:30 a.m. and reporting that all district schools were on lockdown. Authorities in Mount Horeb said without giving details that the “alleged assailant” was harmed, and witnesses described hearing gunshots and seeing dozens of children running.More than four hours later, school buses remained lined up for blocks outside the middle school and authorities had used police tape to surround the middle school, the nearby high school and playing fields between the two buildings.“An initial search of the middle school has not yielded additional suspects,” a post around noon said. “As importantly, we have no reports of individuals being harmed, with the exception of the alleged assailant.”Earlier, the district posted that “the threat has been neutralized outside of the building” but didn’t elaborate on what had happened at the school in Mount Horeb, some 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of the state capital of Madison.Jeanne Keller said she heard about five gunshots while in her shop The Quilting Jeanne, just down the block from the campus that includes the middle school.“It was maybe like pow-pow-pow-pow,” Keller told The Associated Press by phone. “I thought it was fireworks. I went outside and saw all the children running ... I probably saw 200 children.”One middle schooler said his class was in the school gym practicing in-line skating when they heard gunshots.Max Kelly, 12, said his teacher told the class to get out of the school. He said they skated to a street, ditched their in-line skates and ran to a nearby convenience store and gas station and hid in a bathroom.Kelly was reunited with his parents and sat on a hillside with them early Wednesday afternoon waiting for his younger siblings to be released from their own schools. He still wore socks, his shoes left behind.“I don’t think anywhere is safe anymore,” said his mother, 32-year-old Alison Kelly.Police in Mount Horeb said they could not immediately provide information. A person who answered the phone at the school district office declined comment. The Dane County Sheriff’s office directed reporters to a staging area but had not provided updates hours after the school district first alerted families about the incident.The district had begun releasing some students of other schools by early afternoon and anxious parents gathered at a bus depot waiting for their kids.Shannon Hurd, 44, and her former husband, Nathian Hurd, 39, sat in a car waiting for their 13-year-old son, Noah, who was still in the locked-down middle school.Shannon Hurd said she first heard what happened via a text from Noah saying he loved her. She said she nearly fell down the stairs at her work as she ran to get to the school.“I just want my kid,” she said. “They’re supposed to be safe at school.”Stacy Smith, 42, was at the bank Wednesday when she saw police cars rush by and soon got a school district text warning of an active shooter.She initially could not reach her two children — junior Abbi and seventh-grader Cole. Finally, she reached Abbi by phone but the girl whispered that she was hiding in a closet and couldn’t talk. She eventually connected with both children and learned they were OK.“Not here,” she said in disbelief. “You hear about this everywhere else but not here.”Schools nationwide have sought ways to prevent mass shootings inside their walls, from physical security measures and active shooter drills to technology including detailed digital maps. Many also rely on teachers and administrators working to detect early signs of student mental health struggles.The Mount Horeb Area School District’s security protocols were not immediately clear Wednesday and there was no information known about the alleged assailant’s identity or condition.The village is home to around 7,600 people and the central office of outdoor gear retailer Duluth Trading Company. Mount Horeb markets itself as the “troll capital of the world,” a reference to carvings of trolls stationed throughout its downtown district as a tribute to a Scandinavian gift shop that was a landmark for passing long-haul truckers in the 1970s.Heidy Lange, owner of Firefly Events Decor & Flowers, said she was in her florist shop about two blocks from the school when she looked out and saw children running and “probably 50 cop cars from everywhere.”“All of a sudden there was a whole bunch of parents running behind them,” Lange said. “All our phones were beeping with all the alerts. It would devastate the town if something happened to a child here.”","Parents describe children hiding in closets, afraid to communicate on cell phones.

Columbia’s hall cleared of protesters; police asked to stay till May 17



'Not an example of peaceful protest': Whitehouse condemns violent protests



'Free, free Palestine!'



NEW DELHI: As Pro-Palestine, anti-war protests have gained momentum across universities in the US, New York City police officers entered Columbia University late Tuesday and arrested hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters.Over the previous two weeks, more than 1,000 protestors have been arrested on campuses in Texas, Utah, Virginia, North Carolina, New Mexico, Connecticut, Louisiana, California, and New Jersey, some following clashes with riot police.Columbia University has asked the police to remain on the campus until May 17.The White House had decried the standoffs at Columbia and California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt, where demonstrators took two buildings before officers with batons intervened overnight and arrested 25 individuals. Officials projected that the total damage to the northern California school would be more than $1 million.Last week, pro-Palestinian student demonstrators set up a tent encampment at New York's Ivy League universities. Police attempted to evict the encampment on April 18, arresting over 100 demonstrators. However, the approach backfired, energizing students around the country and prompting demonstrators at Columbia to regroup.Hours after police entered Columbia University to clear out pro-Palestinian protestors, clashes broke out at California University with scores of protestors and counter-protestors engaged in a scuffle carrying sticks and metal barricades.The Los Angeles police department informed on X, ""We can confirm that LAPD officers have been deployed, and are currently on the UCLA campus, to assist in restoring order. We are working in partnership with UCLA PD and other law enforcement agencies.""New York City police officers entered Columbia University late Tuesday and arrested pro-Palestinian protesters. The law enforcement action came in response to a prolonged occupation by students who had taken over Hamilton Hall and maintained a tent encampment for nearly two weeks.This police intervention follows a direct call from Mayor Eric Adams earlier in the day, declaring that the ongoing protest ""must end now.""Columbia President Minouche Shafik wrote a letter to senior NYPD officials requesting that police remove demonstrators from the occupied building and a surrounding tent encampment ""with the utmost regret."" She also requested that officers remain on campus until May 17, which is after the university's commencement ceremonies.Calling it an ""absolutely the wrong approach"", Whitehouse condemned the standoffs at Columbia and California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt, where demonstrators took two buildings before officers with batons intervened overnight and arrested 25 individuals.Officials said that the total damage to the northern California school would be more than $1 million.With chants of ""shame on you"" and ""free, free Palestine!"", the student protesters are calling for Columbia University and other institutions to divest from companies involved in the Israeli military operations in Gaza.Their occupation and demonstrations are part of a broader push to protest what they see as injustices in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, aligning with wider protests across the country following Israel’s offensive in Gaza triggered by a Hamas attack on southern Israel.","New York City police officers entered Columbia University late Tuesday and arrested hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters.

Clinton, using the platform X, remarked, ""Still true,"" referring to a tweet she made in February 2021: ""Don't vote for anyone you wouldn't trust with your dog."" This tweet was initially directed at Republican Senator Ted Cruz during a controversial incident but has resurfaced in light of Noem's actions.As per a Daily Mail report, in her book titled ""No Going Back: The Truth on What's Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward,"" Noem reveals that she killed Cricket to demonstrate she could handle ""difficult, messy, and ugly"" situations.The decision has sparked widespread criticism and debate about her judgement and the appropriateness of her response to the dog's behavior, which she described as overly aggressive.Noem recounts in the book that Cricket had been a problem during a pheasant hunt and had killed chickens owned by a local family, behaving like ""a trained assassin."" After these incidents, Noem felt the dog was untrainable and dangerous, leading to her decision to euthanize Cricket. She wrote, ""I hated that dog,"" emphasizing that the animal was ""less than worthless as a hunting dog"" and posed a threat to people.The incident has had political repercussions , with one Trump ally telling The Hill, ""She's DOA,"" implying that the controversy has damaged Noem's prospects as a potential vice-presidential candidate for Donald Trump in 2024. The criticism hinges on the perception that Noem’s actions were extreme and not in line with responsible animal handling or public expectations of political leaders, the Daily Mail report said.In defense, Noem has reiterated on X that tough decisions are often necessary on farms, mentioning other animals her family has had to euthanize. She maintains that her actions were justified under South Dakota law, which allows for the euthanization of dogs that attack livestock, claiming Cricket had exhibited aggressive behavior towards people as well.The backlash continues as the public and political commentators debate the implications of Noem’s actions not only on her political future but also on broader ethical considerations regarding the treatment of animals by public officials.","Former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton has publicly criticized South Dakota governor Kristi Noem.

Pak dissident claims Islamabad orchestrated acid attack against him in UK,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pak-dissident-claims-islamabad-orchestrated-acid-attack-against-him-in-uk/articleshow/109737917.cms,"LONDON: A former federal minister and adviser to Pakistan ex-PM Imran Khan has launched legal action against the govt of Pakistan, claiming it orchestrated an acid attack on him at his UK home.Shahzad Akbar (46), a Pakistani citizen who fled to Britain after Khan was ousted, was nearly blinded in the attack in front of his young child at their home in Royston, Hertfordshire, at 4.35pm on Nov 26, 2023, when he opened the door to two men in motorbike helmets who threw acid from a bottle at his face.He was left with acid burns to his face, head and arm and believes only his glasses and slamming the front door shut prevented him being blinded.The fire and rescue service were called who hosed him down and he was rushed to hospital.He claims the Pakistan govt, or its agents, were behind the attack and is pursuing legal action against the Pakistan govt in the King’s Bench Division of the London high court. The pre-action letter sent on Monday outlines his civil claim for damages for harassment abroad, physical injury, trespass to the person, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.“While in office, Shahzad highlighted army and ISI interference with his accountability and anti-corruption objectives. Believing that he could not fix the rampant corruption in Pakistan, he resigned from Khan’s government in Jan 2022,” a spokesperson for UK law firm Leigh Day, which is representing Akbar, said. On April 17, 2022, he fled to London.“He continues to campaign against corruption in Pakistan and remains highly critical of the military establishment and govt officials,” the spokesperson added.Akbar said: “Compared to what was done to me, I believe a lot worse is being inflicted on dissidents in Pakistan by the current regime. They are targeting political workers, lawyers, judges andjournalists. However, what should be most alarming is that Pakistan is able to target its dissidents on British soil without any accountability.”A spokesperson for Hertfordshire constabulary confirmed to TOI it was investigating the acid attack and was appealing for witnesses and to trace the motorbike the suspects rode. No arrests have been made.The Pakistan high commission in London said: “The govt rejects all such attempts to malign the reputation of its institutions for motivated agendas.”A spokesperson for the Pakistan ministry of foreign affairs said last Dec, when asked about the attack: “We reject any insinuations of Pakistan's involvement and that of Pakistani agencies in such a heinous attack. It is not our policy to target our own nationals abroad. We hope that culprits in this case will be identified and treated as per UK law.”","Shahzad Akbar (46), a Pakistani citizen who fled to Britain after Khan was ousted, was nearly blinded in the attack in front of his young child at their home in Royston, Hertfordshire.

It is not an admirable step because, at this serious juncture of our national life and the lowest point of our economic condition, we should be focusing on substantive issues rather than taking trivial and inconsequential decisions,"" The News quoted Mehboob as saying.Meanwhile, lawyer Abdul Moiz Jaferii highlighted the absence of any pretence of law or order in the notification regarding Dar's appointment on the said post.However, Supreme Court Advocate Basil Nabi Malik is of the view that Article 90(2) of the Constitution does allow the prime minister to act either directly or through his federal ministers.",The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) came down heavily against the Shehbaz Sarif- led government over the appointment of Ishaq Dar as Deputy PM.

Gen. Mao Phalla said the soldiers were transferring ammunition from trucks into a storage facility when the blast occurred, killing them instantly. He said another 11 people, including soldiers and nearby villagers, were slightly injured, mostly from debris from the damaged buildings, not shrapnel.Cambodia held a mass funeral on Sunday for those killed in the explosion.The initial but still not official theory was that the soldiers were unloading ammunition from a truck and stacking it on the ground before moving it into the storage facility, causing one item to explode, he said. That set off a chain reaction, added Mao Phalla.However, he said it will be difficult to determine the exact chain of events as all those involved in the unloading were killed.Mao Phalla said the site has been sealed off and that deminers from theCambodian Mines Action Center were clearing the area any unexploded ordnance.In March 2005, a nighttime blast at an arms depot in the northwestern provincial town of Battambang triggered an hourslong spray of shells and bullets that killed at least six people and caused panic.A 2014 report by the Swiss-based group Small Arms Survey highlighted the dangers of poorly stored or mishandled munitions, calling it a ""global problem.""

This sequence of events highlights the Duchess's ongoing commitment to their international engagements while underscoring her reduced presence in the UK following their move to California Since stepping back from royal duties and relocating to the United States , Meghan has rarely visited the UK, with sources previously citing her desire to avoid the associated ""drama."" Her decision to skip the significant event in London but confirm her presence in Nigeria reflects her and Harry's shifted focus towards global humanitarian and cultural efforts, a Daily Mail report said.Prince Harry's upcoming visit to the UK will be his first since losing a High Court appeal concerning his security arrangements. He is expected to stay in a hotel during his brief visit, which will include giving a reading at St. Paul’s Cathedral on May 8 to mark the Invictus Games' anniversary. Notably, no senior members of the Royal Family are slated to join him for this event.Following his UK visit, Prince Harry will meet Meghan in Nigeria for an ""Invictus-inspired"" trip, as per the couple’s spokesman. They are invited by Nigeria’s chief of defense staff, whom Harry met last September at the Invictus Games in Dusseldorf. The visit will include meeting service members and their families and engaging in traditional cultural activities.The trip to Nigeria holds personal significance for Meghan, who revealed in 2022 that she is 43 percent Nigerian. During a podcast, she expressed a desire to explore this part of her heritage further, which resonates particularly well with Nigerian women she has encountered.The choice to visit Nigeria, potentially aligning with the country's hopes to host a future Invictus Games, appears strategic. Royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams noted that while the trip acts as a ""face saver"" given Meghan's absence from the UK event, it also demonstrates savvy public relations maneuvering by the Sussexes.During Prince Harry's visit, King Charles III is expected to be engaged with other commitments, including his weekly meeting with the Prime Minister and attending the first Buckingham Palace garden party of the summer. The King's packed schedule coincides with his ongoing recovery from a recent cancer diagnosis, highlighting a period of intense public and private engagements for the British monarch.As Harry and Meghan continue to redefine their public roles from their base in the United States, their international visits are closely watched for indications of their future engagements and commitments to causes they support, both within and beyond the Invictus community.",Meghan Markle will not accompany Prince Harry to the upcoming tenth anniversary celebration of the Invictus Games.

UN court rules German military aid to Israel can continue,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/un-court-rules-german-military-aid-to-israel-can-continue/articleshow/109747601.cms,"Germany hails verdict and says it's 'not a party to the conflict'

What did Nicaragua allege?

How did Germany respond?

ICJ to rule on separate genocide allegation

The International Court of Justice ( ICJ ) delivered its preliminary ruling on Tuesday, saying it would not implement emergency measures to stop or limit Germany from providing weapons and other assistance to Israel for the conflict with militant-Islamist Hamas in Gaza.Nicaragua had brought the charges, claiming that Germany's actions breached the 1948 Genocide Convention by allowing violations of international humanitarian law in the Palestinian territory.The broader case is likely to take far longer, but Tuesday's ruling means the court saw insufficient urgent imperative to try to intervene after a preliminary hearing.The court did not, however, grant a German request to throw the case out altogether, saying it would continue.Germany's Foreign Ministry was quick to react online, welcoming the ruling and also saying that ""nobody is above the law"" and that this notion ""guides our actions.""""Germany is not a party to the conflict in the Middle East — quite the contrary. We are working day and night towards a two-state solution. We are the biggest donors of humanitarian aid for Palestinians,"" the Ministry said.""But we do also see: the terrorism of October 7, against which Israel must defend itself, set this new spiral of suffering in motion,"" the ministry said, before noting how roughly 100 hostages remained in Hamas captivity more than half a year after their abduction.Nicaragua's ambassador to the Netherlands, Carlos Jose Arguello Gomez opened his country's case to the ICJ's 16-judge panel earlier this month.""There can be no question that Germany ... was well aware, and is well aware, of at least the serious risk of genocide being committed,"" he said.""Germany is failing to honor its own obligation to prevent genocide or to ensure respect of international humanitarian law.""Nicaragua — a country that has historic ties with the Palestinian people through migration — has requested several provisional measures against Germany.They include that the country ""immediately suspend its aid to Israel, in particular its military assistance including military equipment.""The head of the German legal team, Tania von Uslar-Gleichen, told the panel that Nicaragua's claims ""have no basis in fact or law.""""Where Germany has provided support to Israel, including in a form of export of arms and other military equipment, the quantity and purposes of these supplies have been grossly distorted by Nicaragua,"" von Uslar-Gleichen said.""Our history is the reason why Israel's security has been at the core of Germany's foreign policy,"" she added, referring to Germany's role in the Holocaust.Another of Germany's representatives, Christian Tams, told the court that 98% of arms exports to Israel since October 7 were general equipment like vests, helmets and binoculars.""The moment we look closely, Nicaragua's accusations fall apart,"" Tams told the court.ICJ judges also noted when delivering their ruling how, ""as stated by Germany,"" the volume of military exports to Israel had fallen markedly since November 2023.The decision on Tuesday is only a preliminary one, and Nicaragua's case will likely drag on for years.The ICJ, which was set up to rule in disputes between nations, has emerged as an important forum for international arguments about the war between Israel and Hamas militants.A separate case has seen South Africa accuse Israel of perpetrating genocide in Gaza, charges that Israel has strongly denied.The ICJ made an interim ruling finding it ""plausible"" that Israel's acts could amount to acts of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.Israel's offensive has killed more than 34,500 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory's Health Ministry. Numbers provided by the ministry are generally seen as reliable by UN agencies.The war has displaced about 80% of the population, with hundreds of thousands said to be on the brink of famine.The Gaza war started when Hamas and other Islamist militants staged an attack on southern Israel and killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians in the October 7 attacks. They also took another 250 hostages.Germany, the EU, the US, and others have designated Hamas as a terrorist group.","ICJ says it will not implement emergency measures to stop or limit Germany from providing weapons and other assistance to Israel.
