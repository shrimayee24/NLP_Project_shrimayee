Political reaction

NEW DELHI: A disturbing video has surfaced on social media, showing a man mercilessly thrashing a woman with a bundle of bamboo sticks in public view.The assault, captured in the video, showed the woman being repeatedly struck until she was barely conscious and unable to resist. Shockingly, onlookers present at the scene do not intervene to help the victims.The video, shared widely on social media platforms, drew condemnation from political figures including BJP's Amit Malviya and CPI(M)'s Mohammed Salim.They criticized the safety of women under the Mamata Banerjee-led government in West Bengal , identifying the assailant as a local TMC leader nicknamed 'JCB' allegedly named Tajemul by the CPI(M) state secretary.Following the brutal assault on the woman, Tajemul is also seen in the video assaulting another man who was lying on the ground. Some people from the crowd reportedly assisted in making the man kneel so that Tajemul could continue his attack.Reports suggest that the incident occurred during an 'Insaf Sabha' organized by Tajemul, reminiscent of a Taliban-style 'quick justice' forum. The meeting allegedly convened to address allegations of an extramarital affair involving the victims, who were also fined as part of the so-called arbitration.Local sources cited by TV9 Bangla identified the woman as a married resident of the village, accused of having an extramarital affair with the man assaulted alongside her. The victims reportedly did not receive immediate medical attention after the assault.West Bengal Police have taken action in the case. Islampur Police Superintendent Joby Thomas K confirmed PTI that the police have registered a case upon verifying the video circulating on social media.""We have initiated raids to apprehend the perpetrator and are swiftly investigating the motive behind this reprehensible act,"" Joby Thomas K said.The incident has sparked widespread outrage, with opposition parties BJP and CPI(M) accusing the TMC of orchestrating what they describe as ""bulldozer justice"" under chief minister Mamata Banerjee 's administration.BJP's social media head Malviya condemned the incident, highlighting broader concerns about law and order under the TMC regime.He said, “India must wake up to the reality of Sharia Courts in TMC run West Bengal. There is a Sandeshkhali in every village and chief minister Mamata Banerjee is a curse for women. There is no semblance of law and order in Bengal. Will Mamata Banerjee act against this monster or defend him like she stood up for Sheikh Shahjahan?”He called on the National Commission for Women (NCW) to intervene and criticized Mamata Banerjee for what he described as systemic issues of governance in West Bengal.CPI(M) West Bengal state secretary Mohammed Salim echoed these sentiments, criticizing the state government for failing to uphold justice and women's safety. He referred to the incident as worse than a ""Kangaroo Court"" scenario, demanding accountability from the administration.Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury also weighed in on a separate incident, condemning an alleged assault on a minority woman in Cooch Behar. ""Attacks on women, irrespective of their caste, are unacceptable... Elections have been held, results have been declared, and the ruling party has won the maximum seats in the state, so why is the government resorting to violence in the state? Nowhere in the country are we seeing such cases as are seen in Bengal after the elections? No one has the right to exercise violence against women,"" Chowdhury said.Local TMC MLA Hamidur Rahman, however, has distanced himself from the accused, characterizing the incident as a local matter unrelated to the party.TMC district president Kaniyalal Agarwal attributed the assault to disapproval within the community regarding the couple's alleged relationship. He said the alleged illicit relationship ""did not go down well with the villagers"".TMC spokesperson Shantanu Sen condemned the incident but also pointed out that such kangaroo courts were common during the Left Front regime too.","A video shows a man mercilessly thrashing a woman with a bundle of bamboo sticks in public view.

'Actions exhibit high degree of severity ... ': Delhi court sentences Medha Patkar to 5 months in LG defamation case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/medha-patkar-gets-5-month-jail-in-lg-defamation-case/articleshow/111415519.cms,"False Charges

Undermine Trust: Court

NEW DELHI: A city court on Monday sentenced activist Medha Patkar (70) to five months of simple imprisonment in a criminal defamation case filed by Delhi LG VK Saxena .The court of metropolitan magistrate Raghav Sharma took note of the activist's age and medical condition but observed these factors ""do not absolve her of the serious nature of her offence"", reported.The court directed Patkar to pay Rs 10 lakh as compensation to LG Saxena, saying the imposition of the substantial fine recognises the ""extensive harm and prolonged suffering that the complainant had endured over the 23-24 years of legal battle"" and was a tangible acknowledgement of his distress.The offence entails a maximum punishment of simple imprisonment of up to two years or fine or both.The sentence will remain suspended for 30 days to give Patkar enough opportunity to file an appeal, said the court. It had on May 24 convicted the activist in the case filed in 2000 by Saxena when he was president of National Council of Civil Liberties because of a defamatory press release.""The unfounded accusations, such as involvement in hawala transactions and compromising the interests of Gujarat's people for foreign entities, were designed to ruin the complainant's public image and credibility. The complainant experienced profound damage to hisreputation , trustworthiness and social standing. These defamatory remarks led to severe personal and professional hardships, forcing the complainant to suffer through the anguish of a drawn-out legal battle for over 20 years,"" said the court.Advocates Gajinder Kumar and Kiran Jai, Saxena's counsels, requested the court that the fine amount be given to Delhi State Legal Services Authority. Responding to this, the court said that the complainant could dispense the amount as per his own wish after receiving it.Taking note of Patkar's distinguished status, which got her 28 national and five international awards, including Right to Livelihood Award (alternative Nobel), the court remarked that this makes her actions ""even more reprehensible"" and that her respectable position in society brings with it a responsibility to uphold the truth and act with integrity.""The fact that someone of her stature made such false and damaging allegations aggravates her liability as it undermines public trust and sets a negative example,"" the court noted. However, referring to her age as well as medical condition, the court said a balanced approach was required and it wished to impose a ""just and humane"" punishment.Rejecting the request of Patkar's counsels for probation, the court said her actions exhibit a ""high degree of severity and intentionality"", clearly aimed at inflicting significant reputational harm on Saxena and there is no indication of remorse or acceptance of responsibility for the damage inflicted on him.The court said that by accusing Saxena of involvement in hawala transactions, Patkar had linked him to illegal financial activities without any evidence and seriously undermined his financial integrity and public trust.Furthermore, the accusation that he was ""mortgaging the people of Gujarat and their resources to foreign interests"" suggested that he was betraying the trust of the citizens of Gujarat for personal gain, which is a grave imputation that irreparably damaged his reputation and standing, the court said. Labelling the complainant a ""coward"" and ""not a patriot"" further intensified the defamatory nature of the accusations, the court said.","A city court on Monday sentenced activist Medha Patkar to five months of simple imprisonment in a criminal defamation case.

Police have invoked IPC Sections 120 B (criminal conspiracy), 115 (abetment), and 506 (2) (criminal intimidation).In early April, Panvel police inspector Nitin Thackeray received intelligence about Bishnoi gang members planning an attack on Khan. Investigations revealed that Bishnoi had given a Rs 25 lakh supari (contract) to gang members to attack Khan. The gang used a WhatsApp group with 15-16 members, including Bishnoi's Canada-based cousin Anmol Bishnoi, Goldy Brar, Ajay Kashyap, Vinod Bhatia, Vaspi Mehmood Khan alias China and Rizwan Hassan Khan to communicate and execute the attack.The police have identified Sukha Shooter and Dogar from Pakistan, who were supposed to supply sophisticated weapons like AK-47, M16, or M5.

The Army is spending huge amounts on a battery of lawyers to defend itself against the case made out by Singh.Claiming that he was made a ‘scapegoat’ by the then top brass of the Army to cover up their mistakes that led to the Kargil War , Singh is not only seeking his professional restitution, but also a complete investigation into the Kargil War.Initially, he had moved the Delhi high court in 2002.His main allegations are that intrusion was facilitated rather than taking prompt action on the inputs given by him.Following the constitution of military tribunals in the country, the case was referred to AFT’s Delhi bench in 2010. Later, on request of Singh, who is settled in Chandigarh and lost his hearing during the Kargil War, the matter was shifted to AFT Chandigarh in 2010 on medical grounds.According to the officer, he was “made scapegoat by senior Army officers to cover their faults.”“I know, it’s a fight between two unequal forces but the honour of my troops, brigade and my khandan (clan) is at stake, and I will continue to fight,” says Singh.The veteran, who has been granted all the retiral benefits including pension, is pursuing the matter only to restore his honour.During the long pending litigation, Singh has suffered physical, mental as well as financial harassment, but he has faithfully stuck to his stand that he is innocent.During the War, Brig Singh was posted as the commander of 121 Infantry Brigade group, popularly known as the Kargil Brigade .He was dismissed from service on the basis of a Court of Inquiry (COI), held on Sept 1999 by 3-Infantry division, in which he was found to be held guilty of retaining classified documents at his residence, failure to surrender classified document on relinquishing the charge of the brigade, making additional photocopies of classified documents and similar other charges under various provisions of Pamphlet Handling of Classified Documents, 1966.He is the first Army officer who was dismissed from the service without any general court martial (GCM).Advocate MP Goswami , who has been representing Singh in this case for a long time, said that this is perhaps the oldest case left with the AFT for final adjudication.

Melania Trump was spotted in New York outside Trump Tower Monday, for the first time after skipping husband's first presidential debate on June 27. Reports that she won't be returning to the White House for a full time role if Trump becomes the President again surfaced making Melania most sought-after amid this election season. She has remained elusive as far as campaigning for her husband is concerned.On July 8, she is supposed to attend a fundraiser for Log Cabin Republicans -- the largest conservative LGBTQ+ organization.Monday she was clicked wearing green pants, a black jacket and carrying a large black Louis Vuitton bag.All eyes are on Melania Trump as she is nowhere to be seen at Trump's campaign. She also missed the presidential debate. This was not the scene in 2016 and 2020. Reports claim Melania has made a deal with Trump that if he wins the presidency, she will not be the 24X7 first lady, She will be in the White House only on occasions -- and the rest of the time she will spend with their son Barron Trump who may join New York University in the fall.“Barron has never been completely on his own before — and with the added stress of him being both a freshman in college and potentially the son of a president in a predominantly Democratic city, Melania wants to be close… The added attention he’ll get if his father is president worries Melania who is also concerned about reaction at his school over Barron’s ever-present Secret Service detail,” an insider said.Melania, in fact, did not allow Baron to be a delegate for Florida. “While Barron is honored to have been chosen as a delegate by the Florida Republican Party, he regretfully declines to participate due to prior commitments,” Melania's office issued a statement earlier indicating that she was not keen on her son getting involved in politics now.","All eyes are on Melania Trump as she is nowhere to be seen at Trump's campaign.

Trump seeks to set aside New York hush money verdict hours after Supreme Court ruling,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-seeks-to-set-aside-new-york-hush-money-verdict-hours-after-supreme-court-ruling/articleshow/111417630.cms,"NEW YORK: Donald Trump 's lawyers on Monday asked the New York judge who presided over his hush money trial to set aside his conviction and delay his sentencing , scheduled for next week.The letter to Judge Juan M. Merchan cited the US Supreme Court's ruling earlier Monday and asked the judge to delay Trump's sentencing while he weighs the high court's decision and how it could influence the New York case, according to the letter obtained by The Associated Press.The lawyers argue that the Supreme Court's decision confirmed a position the defense raised earlier in the case that prosecutors should have been precluded from introducing some evidence they said constituted official presidential acts, according to the letter.In prior court filings, Trump contended he is immune from prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office. His lawyers did not raise that as a defense in the hush money case, but they argued that some evidence - including Trump's social media posts about former lawyer Michael Cohen - comes from his time as president and should have been excluded from the trial because of immunity protections.The Manhattan district attorney's office declined comment Monday night.The Supreme Court on Monday ruled for the first time that former presidents have broad immunity from prosecution, extending the delay in the Washington criminal case against Trump on charges he plotted to overturn his 2020 presidential election loss.Trump was convicted in New York of 34 counts of falsifying business records, arising from what prosecutors said was an attempt to cover up a hush money payment just before the 2016 presidential election. He is scheduled to be sentenced in the hush money case on July 11.Merchan instituted a policy in the run-up to the trial requiring both sides to send him a one-page letter summarizing their arguments before making longer court filings. He said he did that to better manage the docket, so he was not inundated with voluminous paperwork.In denying Trump's bid to move the trial from New York state court to federal court last year, a federal judge found that the allegations at the center of the case pertained to Trump's personal life, and do not ""reflect in any way the color of the President's official duties.""""The evidence overwhelmingly suggests that the matter was a purely a personal item of the President - a cover-up of an embarrassing event,"" US District Judge Alvin K.

The sentence could keep Bannon imprisoned almost to Election Day. Inmates in federal prison do not have access to the internet or social media, making it difficult for Bannon to communicate with fans of his War Room podcast.Bannon on Friday lost a last-ditch effort to stay out of prison when the Supreme Court rejected his request to delay his sentence while he exhausts the appeals process for his conviction.He was sentenced to four months after being convicted in 2022 of two misdemeanor counts of contempt of Congress. He was charged after he refused to turn over documents or testify to a Democratic-led House of Representatives committee investigating the Capitol riot by Trump supporters who had sought to prevent congressional certification of Biden's 2020 election win.Bannon was a key adviser to Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, then served as his chief White House strategist during 2017 before a falling out between them that was later patched up. He also has played an instrumental role in right-wing media.He initially was allowed to delay starting his prison term while he appealed his conviction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The D.C. Circuit ultimately upheld his conviction, prompting U.S. District Court Judge Carl Nichols to order Bannon to report to prison.Bannon will not be the first former top official from Trump's White House to go to prison for refusing to cooperate with the committee. Peter Navarro, a former Trump trade adviser, reported to prison in March after being given a four-month sentence. The Supreme Court declined Navarro's request to remain free during his appeal.Trump in 2021 pardoned Bannon on federal criminal charges accusing him of swindling Trump supporters involving an effort to raise private funds to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. Bannon has pleaded not guilty to state charges regarding the border wall fundraising and is awaiting trial.","Bannon is expected to serve his time at a low security federal prison in Danbury, Connecticut.

"Hurricane Beryl, a Category 4 storm, pummels Caribbean islands, eyes Jamaica",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/hurricane-beryl-a-category-4-storm-pummels-caribbean-islands-eyes-jamaica/articleshow/111418849.cms,"A woman walks through a debris filled street in the Hastings neighborhood after Hurricane Beryl passed in Bridgetown, Barbados.

What is the current status of Hurricane Beryl?

Beryl is now a Category 4 hurricane with winds reaching 155 mph (250 km/h). The storm is expected to maintain its intensity as it moves west-northwest at 21 mph, nearing Jamaica by Wednesday.

What regions are currently under threat from Beryl?

Jamaica has issued a hurricane warning , and tropical storm warnings are in effect for parts of the Dominican Republic and Haiti. The storm is anticipated to bring heavy rain and strong winds across Barbados, the Windward Islands, and other parts of the southeastern Caribbean.

What damage has Beryl already caused?

In Bridgetown, Barbados, streets have been flooded, and in St. Vincent, buildings have lost roofs, and power outages have been reported. Grenada experienced widespread power outages, and the storm ripped off doors, windows, and roofs in homes across the region.

How are local residents reacting to the hurricane?

In Kingston, Jamaica, some residents, like waiter Welton Anderson, remain calm, stating, ""Jamaicans wait until the last minute. The night before or in the morning the panic sets in."" However, preparations are underway across affected areas, with people boarding up windows, stocking up on supplies, and filling their vehicles with fuel.

What are the preparations in Mexico for Beryl's arrival?

Mexican officials are urging extreme caution as they prepare for Beryl’s potential impact later in the week. The government is assessing damages from previous storms and emphasizing the risk of rivers rising due to already saturated basins.

What role does climate change play in the intensity of Hurricane Beryl?

Scientists attribute the unusual early formation and rapid intensification of Beryl to climate change. Warmer Atlantic waters have contributed to the storm’s strength. ""Climate change is loading the dice for more intense hurricanes to form,"" said Christopher Rozoff, an atmospheric scientist.

Why did the US judge call Karen Read’s cop boyfriend murder 'mistrial'?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-did-the-us-judge-call-karen-reads-cop-boyfriend-murder-mistrial/articleshow/111417973.cms,"A Massachusetts judge in the US declared Karen Read ’s murder trial "" mistrial "" after jurors deadlocked in the case with no decision despite over 26 hours of deliberation .The court came to this conclusion after the jurors sent notes to Cannone saying they were hopelessly deadlocked. The judge delivered Tuey-Rodriguez instructions — sometimes referred to as “dynamite” instructions intended to blast apart deadlocked juries in Massachusetts, the Washington Post reported.Moments after Judge Beverly J Cannone called a mistrial, Norfolk County District Attorney Michael Morrissey’s office announced that they intend to retry the case.The prosecutors said in a statement, “First, we thank the O’Keefe family for their commitment and dedication to this long process. They maintained sight of the true core of this case — to find justice for John O’Keefe. The Commonwealth intends to re-try the case,” according to AP.According to the prosecutor, Karen Read, who was accused of drunkenly driving into her police officer boyfriend and leaving him to die in January 2022, was drinking with her partner O’Keefe before she dropped him off at a party at the home of Brian Albert, a fellow officer. They said she hit him with her SUV before driving away.While prosecutors were blaming her for Keefe's death, the defence lawyers tried to paint her as the victim in the case. The defence said that Keefe was killed inside Albert’s home and then dragged outside and left for dead, reported Washington Post.They argued that investigators focused on Read because she was a “convenient outsider” who saved them from having to consider other suspects, including Albert and other law enforcement officers at the party.After the prosecutors said that they will re-try, defense attorney Alan Jackson said, “They failed. They failed miserably, and they’ll continue to fail... No matter how long it takes, no matter how long they keep trying, we will not stop fighting,” AP reported.The trial, which lasted for two months, centered around police procedures and the connections between those involved. Law enforcement officials admitted to gathering blood evidence using red plastic cups and attempting to remove snow to uncover evidence with a leaf blower. The primary investigator also confessed to sending inappropriate messages about Read from his mobile phone.Read faced a charge of second-degree murder, which carries a potential life sentence with the possibility of parole in Massachusetts. Additionally, she was accused of lesser offenses, including manslaughter while driving under the influence, which is punishable by five to 20 years in prison, and fleeing the scene of a fatal accident, which can result in a sentence of up to 10 years.",Karen Read was accused of drunkenly driving into her police officer boyfriend and leaving him to die in January 2022.

'Big win for constitution': Former US President Donald Trump hails Supreme Court's 'immunity' ruling,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/big-win-for-constitution-former-us-president-donald-trump-hails-supreme-courts-immunity-ruling/articleshow/111417835.cms,"Former US President Donald Trump hailed the recent ruling of the Supreme Court that former presidents have absolute immunity for their official acts calling it a ""Big win for constitution and democracy"".The US Supreme Court then left it to the lower courts to see how the ruling impacted their case with regards to Trump as he faces charges related to his role in the 6 January 2021 Capitol riots and alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election results, as reported by Sky News.The former president was charged with conspiracy to defraud the US, conspiring against the right of Americans to vote, and corruptly obstructing an official proceeding. Despite being charged, Trump has pleaded not guilty. Following the Supreme Court's ruling, Trump was "" Proud to be an American"" as he expressed his satisfaction on social media.The decision is significant as it marks the first time the Supreme Court has addressed the issue of a former president's immunity from prosecution. However, the division among the justices was evident. The three liberal justices dissented, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor strongly criticizing the ruling. ""Today's decision to grant former presidents criminal immunity reshapes the institution of the presidency. It makes a mockery of the principle, foundational to our constitution and system of government, that no man is above the law,"" wrote Sotomayor. She continued, ""In every use of official power, the president is now a king above the law. With fear for our democracy, I dissent.""Former attorney general Eric Holder also voiced his concerns, calling the decision ""absurd and dangerous"" and stating, ""Our democracy has been gravely wounded.""Trump's legal team had contended that he was immune from prosecution for actions taken while serving as president. They argued that his role at the time should shield him from legal consequences. Special Counsel Jack Smith, who brought the charges against Trump in August last year, has opposed this view, emphasizing that ""no one is above the law.""A trial was initially scheduled to begin on March 4, but the decision on immunity has caused delays, leaving the trial date unset. The Supreme Court's referral of the case to lower courts could further extend these delays. With the upcoming presidential election on November 5, it is becoming increasingly unlikely that any trial on these charges will conclude before the election.Trump still faces three other indictments. Special Counsel Jack Smith is heading two federal investigations into Trump, both resulting in criminal charges. The Washington case focuses on Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election, while the Florida case involves the mishandling of classified documents. Another case in Georgia also pertains to Trump's actions following his 2020 electoral defeat.Trump has consistently maintained that the cases against him are politically driven attempts to prevent his return to the White House.Trump, aged 78, became the first former president to be convicted of a felony in May as he was found guilty of falsifying business records to conceal a hush money payment made during the 2016 presidential election to adult film actress Stormy Daniels , who claims to have had a sexual encounter with him, a claim Trump denies.","Former US President Donald Trump hailed the recent ruling of the Supreme Court that former presidents have absolute immunity for their official acts.

North Korea says its recent missile tests involved new ballistic missile with 'super-large warhead',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/north-korea-says-its-recent-missile-tests-involved-new-ballistic-missile-with-super-large-warhead/articleshow/111417662.cms,"SEOUL: North Korea said Tuesday it had test-fired a new tactical ballistic missile capable of carrying a huge warhead, as the country is pushing to modernize its weapons arsenal to cope with what it calls U.S.-led threats.The North’s official Korean Central News Agency called the weapon Hwasongpho-11Da-4.5 which can carry 4.5 ton-class “super-large warhead.”It said the test-fire on Monday was meant to verify flight stability and hit accuracy at the maximum range of 500 kilometers (310 miles) and the minimum range of 90 kilometers (55 miles).South Korea’s military earlier said that North Korea launched two ballistic missiles from one of its southwestern towns in a northeastern direction on Monday and that the first missile flew 600 kilometers (370 miles) and the second missile 120 kilometers (75 miles). The second missile's flight distance was too short to reach the waters off the North's east coast, a typical landing site for North Korean test missiles.South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the second North Korean missile possibly travelled abnormally during the initial stage of its flight. It said if the missile exploded, its debris would likely have scattered on the ground though no damages was immediately reported.The KCNA dispatch didn’t say from where it launched the new missile and where it landed. But the fact that it tested both the missile’s maximum and minimum ranges suggested North Korea performed two launches.KCNA, citing North Korea’s Missile Administration, reported that North Korea will test-fire the missile again later in July to verify the performances of its simulated warhead at the medium range of 250 kilometers (155 miles).Since 2022, North Korea has sharply accelerated weapons testing activities to enlarge its arsenal of nuclear-capable weapons designed to strike key sites in the mainland U.S., South Korea and Japan. The ranges of the newly tested missile suggest it targets South Korea. Experts say North Korea would ultimately want to use an expanded nuclear arsenal to increase its leverage in future diplomacy with the U.S.Monday's missile's test were the North Korea's first weapons firing in five days. Last Wednesday, North Korea launched what it called a multiwarhead missile in the first known test of a developmental weapon aimed at penetrating its rivals' missile defenses. North Korea said the launch was successful, but South Korea dismissed the North’s claim as deception to cover up a failed launch.The latest launches came a day after North Korea vowed “offensive and overwhelming” responses to a new U.S. military drill with South Korea and Japan.","North Korea test-fired a new tactical ballistic missile capable of carrying a huge warhead.

He was unwell,"" said one person who said they appealed to Biden's top aides in the days before, to no avail. ""What a bad decision to send him out looking sick and exhausted.""The debate strategy, approved by campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon and backed by Dunn, involved a rigorous preparation schedule at Camp David.Prior to the debate, Biden's poll numbers had begun to improve following Trump's conviction for falsifying documents and the president's successful visits to Europe. However, critics argue that the preparation should have focused more on the broader vision Biden needs to convey to the nation, and that he lacked sufficient rest before the event.The decision to participate in the debate came as a surprise to some advisers, with Biden's team opting to reject the traditional debates organized by the Commission on Presidential Debates in favor of a more controlled setting on CNN. Despite this, Biden's performance was widely criticized, with his appearance and demeanor described as wan, straggly, and frequently incoherent.In the aftermath of the debate, Biden delivered a strong speech in North Carolina and pledged to continue his campaign, with many donors and Democrats rallying around him. However, discussions about potential alternative candidates for the 2024 election are already taking place within the Democratic Party.","US President Joe Biden's lackluster debate performance has drawn criticism from Democratic supporters, donors, and former and current aides.

Lichtman said the incumbent party would need to lose six of those actors, or “keys,” to lose the White House, USA Today reported.Lichtman did not undermine the performance of the debate but said in 1984 former president Ronald Regan could swing the election despite performing poorly in the debate. “At the first sign of adversity the spineless Democrats want to throw under the bus, their own incumbent president.

WASHINGTON: Ever present by the US president's side after his calamitous debate -- and foursquare behind him as he vowed to fight on in his reelection bid -- First Lady Jill Biden has been fighting her husband's battles from the front lines.""I think she is as influential as pundits are claiming and her opinion likely matters more to him than anyone else's,"" said Tammy Vigil, a professor of communications at Boston University.""Without her support, it would be impossible for him to continue in the race.""The 73-year-old community college professor was making headlines of her own on Monday, as Vogue unveiled the cover of its August issue -- with the first lady looking seraphic in a long white tuxedo gown by Ralph Lauren.The picture and the article date from April, long before President Joe Biden struggled to make himself understood during a halting, unfocused performance at a CNN debate against Republican rival Donald Trump.But in a note introducing the article, the magazine's editors revealed they'd had a telephone conversation with the first lady shortly after the debate, as calls mounted for her 81-year-old husband to withdraw his candidacy.- 'The right person' -She told Vogue the Biden family ""will not let those 90 minutes define the four years he's been president.""The woman who has shared her last 47 years with the Democratic leader also told a weekend meeting of donors: ""Joe isn't just the right person for the job. He's the only person for the job.""On Thursday, after the debate, Jill Biden was shown taking her husband's arm to help him down a few steps in the CNN studio.The following day, she was there again in a dress that read ""vote,"" as a much more energetic Joe Biden headlined a rally in North Carolina.Before they married in 1977, Joe Biden had been turned into a widower by a horrific car crash five years earlier that had claimed the lives of his first wife and their infant daughter. His two boys, Beau and Hunter, survived.The family was revisited by tragedy years later as Beau, a cherished son at the start of what looked like a promising political career of his own, died of cancer.Adding to the family's difficulties, Hunter struggled for years with a crack addiction.The first lady is now the center of gravity of the troubled but burgeoning clan, bolstered with the birth of Jill and Joe's daughter Ashley a few years after their wedding -- and eventually the arrival of their grandchildren.Without her support, the Democrat would not have embarked on his quest for a second term.When she arrived at the White House, she continued to teach English at a college near Washington, unheard of for a president's wife.Meanwhile, she assumed the traditional role of first lady -- in charge of Christmas decorations and gala dinner menus, as well as promoting pet causes -- in her case, literacy.Amid the shaky reelection campaign , Jill Biden could well encourage an outpouring of sympathy with her passionate advocacy for the president since his calamitous showdown with Trump -- but also risks alienating a segment of public opinion by doing so.""A contemporary US first lady is supposed to be the 'not-so-secret weapon' that helps her husband by attesting to his character and by helping raise funds, et cetera.

Biden voiced his disapproval from the White House , marking his first remarks since a recent shaky debate with Trump.The US Supreme Court's decision was a landmark ruling, acknowledging for the first time any form of presidential immunity from prosecution.The ruling was considered a win for Trump, against whom Biden is running for re-election. Trump cannot be prosecuted for actions within his presidential duties but can face charges for private acts.""This nation was founded on the principle that there are no kings in America,"" Biden said. ""That fundamentally changed,"" he added, emphasising that no one should be above the law.Biden has been critical of Trump's actions related to the January 6, 2021, raid on the US Capitol . The attack was carried out by Trump's supporters, who were influenced by his false claims that he had won the 2020 election.Biden, who is 81 years old, is facing scrutiny following a debate performance in Atlanta that led to calls for him to step aside as the Democratic Party's candidate. His White House remarks are being closely watched as indicators of his capability to run for re-election and govern for another term.The recent debate against Trump, in which Biden stumbled over his words, has heightened attention on his ability to continue in his role. His latest statements were carefully monitored for signs of stability and readiness for the challenges ahead.","Biden voiced his disapproval from the White House, marking his first remarks since a recent shaky debate with Trump. The US Supreme Court's decision was a landmark ruling, acknowledging for the first time any form of presidential immunity from prosecution. Biden has been critical of Trump's actions related to the January 6, 2021, raid on the US Capitol.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111417114,imgsize-1359883,width-400,resizemode-4/111417114.jpg"
Trump entitled to absolute immunity for clearly official acts: US Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-entitled-to-absolute-immunity-for-clearly-official-acts-us-supreme-court/articleshow/111412845.cms,"WASHINGTON: The US Supreme Court on Monday ruled that former president Donald Trump is entitled to “absolute” immunity for clearly official acts , implicitly overturning the principle that no person is above the law and paving way for an imperial presidency in America.By a 6-3 majority, conservatives on the SC bench, three of them appointed by Trump, said that broad immunity for official conduct is needed to protect “an energetic, independent executive”.The three liberal justices on the bench dissented, saying the decision was gravely misguided and it ""effectively creates a law-free zone around the president, upsetting the status quo that has existed since the founding”.Although Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for the majority, argued that the president “enjoys no immunity for his unofficial acts, and not everything the president does is official... (and) the president is not above the law”, liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor in her dissent for the minority said the broad immunity “reshapes the institution of the presidency” and “makes a mockery of the principle” that no man is above the law.The ruling sends back to lower courts the election interference case against Trump and will almost certainly help run the clock down to the 2024 elections.The ruling still leaves it to the trial court to determine what Trump did or instigated constitutes official or unofficial acts, but the process will most certainly take months, effectively letting the voters decide the matter.If Trump wins on Nov 5, he can simply quash the case when he assumes office, by either ordering the justice department to drop the charges against him, or pardon himself.If Biden wins, he too, should he choose to do so, ride into an imperial presidency, forever changing the nature of politics in the self-professed ""greatest democracy in the world"".The Supreme Court conservatives tried to finesse the ruling saying a former president has absolute immunity for his core constitutional powers — and is entitled to a presumption of immunity for his official acts, but lacks immunity for unofficial acts.""No court has thus far considered how to distinguish between official and unofficial acts,"" the conservative majority wrote, while cautioning Trump against asserting ""a far broader immunity than the limited one we have recognised"".But Trump was already gloating over the ruling, posting “BIG WIN FOR OUR CONSTITUTION AND DEMOCRACY. PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN!” on Truth Social.Democratic leaders raged at the ruling, with New York Senator Chuck Schumer calling it a ""disgraceful decision by the MAGA SCOTUS—which is comprised of 3 justices appointed by Trump himself.""Fundamentally, what the conservative justices ruled upheld Richard Nixon's claim in 1974 during the Watergate scandal: “When the president does it, that means that it is not illegal."" Nixon would not have had to resign under current SC ruling even though he tried to cheat his way into a second term.","US Supreme Court rules that former president Donald Trump is entitled to “absolute” immunity for clearly official acts.

The United Nations Working Group on arbitrary detention has called for Khan's immediate release, stating that his detention lacks legal basis and appears politically motivated.The working group raised serious concerns about multiple cases brought against Khan since his ousting in April 2022.Their opinion, dated March 25 but made public on Monday, highlights that Khan's deprivation of liberty breaches several international laws and norms.""Khan's detention had no legal basis and appears to have been intended to disqualify him from running for political office,"" the working group concluded. ""Thus, from the outset, that prosecution was not grounded in law and was reportedly instrumentalised for a political purpose.""The five independent experts called on Pakistan 's government to ""take the steps necessary to remedy the situation of Mr Khan without delay and bring it into conformity with the relevant international norms.""""The appropriate remedy would be to release Mr Khan immediately and accord him an enforceable right to compensation and other reparations, in accordance with international law,"" they added.Khan served as prime minister from 2018 to 2022 and has faced over 200 legal cases since his removal, which he claims is a campaign to keep him from power.

This month, his 10-year sentence for treason was overturned, but he remains in Adiala jail, south of Islamabad, for an illegal marriage conviction.Khan was cleared for release before those convictions in the days leading up to Pakistan's February 8 general elections.Neither Pakistan's interior nor information ministry immediately responded to a request for comment.Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party hailed the ruling as ""a huge victory.""""It has shown without any one percent of doubt that Imran Khan is innocent and has been thrown into prison illegally,"" said PTI spokesman Syad Zulfiqar Bukhari in a statement.",UN Working Group on arbitrary detention calls for immediate release of Imran Khan.

This sentencing follows a severe mob attack targeting Christians in the eastern Punjab province last year.In August 2023, violence erupted in Faisalabad's Jaranwala when some local Muslims claimed to have seen a Christian, Raja Amir, and his friend tearing pages from a Quran, throwing them on the ground, and writing insulting remarks on other pages.Police chief Rizwan Khan said the alleged act angered the local Muslims, who attacked multiple churches and several Christian homes, burning furniture and other household items. Some members of the Christian community fled their homes to escape the mob.Ehsan Shan, who was not directly involved in the alleged desecration, was accused of reposting the defaced Quranic pages on his TikTok account, according to his lawyer, Khurram Shahzad. Shahzad also stated his intention to appeal the death sentence , which was handed down on Saturday by a court in Sahiwal, Punjab province.Amir Farooq, the police officer responsible for Shan's arrest, said that the man shared ""the hateful content at a sensitive time when authorities were already struggling to contain the violence.""Naveed Kashif, a local priest in Sahiwal, questioned ""why the court ordered such an extreme verdict when those linked to the attacks are yet to be punished,"" while acknowledging that he did not condone Shan's actions, AP reported.In Pakistan, a country with a Muslim majority - Blasphemy is a burning issue. Even mere claims of disrespect towards Islam and its Prophet Mohammed can incite violent and deadly responses from vigilante groups.Ever since 2011, when Punjab Governor Salmaan Taseer was assassinated by his own bodyguard for advocating the reform of blasphemy laws, since then there has been little to no deliberations over this issue.Earlier this month, 72-year-old Nazir Masih succumbed to injuries sustained during an attack by an angry mob in May, following accusations of blasphemy.","Ehsan Shan was accused of reposting the defaced Quranic pages on his TikTok account, according to his lawyer, Khurram Shahzad.

One of the convicts, however, got injured during the escape and later died at a local hospital.The incident occurred between 2 pm and 2:30 pm on Sunday when a prisoner asked a sentry to move his 'lassi' (a yogurt-based drink) outside his barrack. When the sentry obliged, the prisoner overpowered him, snatched his keys, and opened other barracks from where at least 19 prisoners made their way to the main gate, according to Dawn citing police.At that time, a pistol was thrown inside through the roof , which was used to break the lock from the inside. One prisoner was injured during the gunfire, but the others managed to escape, they said.Despite plans for a new prison on the outskirts, progress has been minimal. Following the jailbreak , authorities took eight prison officials, including the deputy superintendent, into custody for investigation. Additionally, the PoK 's government swiftly formed an inquiry committee to investigate the incident within a week.In a late-night statement, information secretary Ansar Yaqoob disclosed that PoK's PM Chaudhry Anwarul Haq suspended several prison officials and removed special home secretary Badar Munir from his position as ex-officio inspector general of prisons. Munir was subsequently attached to the services department as OSD.Among the escapees were six death row inmates, reportedly led by Ghazi Shahzad from Sudhnoti district in PoK, who was arrested by the counter-terrorism department the previous year along with three accomplices from Hajira town. Shahzad, booked under the anti-terrorism act and APC Section 302, had yet to be convicted. Notably, his three associates remained in custody, as did another individual involved in a prior incident, reported Dawn.Further details provided by authorities identified the escaped prisoners and the deceased inmate, Mohammad Khayyam, from Mutyalmera village.

Kabul harbouring TTP leaders, claims Pakistan

NEW DELHI: Amid heightened tensions with the Taliban rulers in Kabul and under increasing pressure from China, the Pakistan government has approved a new military campaign named Azm-e-Istehkam, meaning ""Resolve for Stability"", to root out domestic terror threats and stem the activities of fighters crossing over from Afghanistan .Speaking about the new initiative, defence minister Khawaja Asif recently told the Voice of America that Pakistan was even willing to go as far as carrying out cross-border strikes to eliminate militant hideouts in Afghanistan -- a move that could potentially trigger a retaliatory move from the Taliban regime.There has been a spike in terror-related incidents in Pakistan ever since the Taliban stormed back to power in Kabul in August 2021 after the US suddenly withdrew from the war-torn country.Pakistan has seen nearly 1,000 casualties from almost 700 incidents of violence in 2023.Many of the incidents have centered around Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Baluchistan areas.Terror incidents in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have been of particular concern to the Pakistan government as they have resulted in the deaths of many Chinese citizens working on projects related to Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative.Attacks targeting Chinese installations and personnel have highlighted the stakes for Pakistan's key ally, China, which has invested $62 billion in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).China has come out strongly against the attacks and has sternly warned Islamabad that it must take strict and effective action or it would re-evaluate its investments and projects in the country.Pakistan has blamed the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) for majority of the attacks and has repeatedly asserted that the terrorist organisation's leaders are being given a safe haven in the border areas of Afghanistan.The defence minister's strong statement came on the day JUI-F Maulana Fazlur Rehman warned about the critical security situation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.Rehman has claimed that things have reached a point where even the police could not go out at night due to the presence of armed men. The TTP ended its ceasefire with Pakistan in November 2022.In an interview with Voice of America, Asif said Islamabad could strike terror havens in Afghanistan and it would not be against international law since Kabul had been ""exporting"" terrorism to Pakistan and the ""exporters"" were being harboured there.He said though the TTP was operating from the neighbouring country, its cadre, about a few thousand in number, ""are operating from within the country"" and blamed the previous Imran Khan-led PTI government for bringing militancy back.The minister also ruled out any chances of dialogue with the banned outfit, saying that there was no common ground.Speaking about 'Azm-i-Istehkam', Asif said parliament would be taken on board in this regard and the concerns of political parties would also be addressed.Dawn reported that in separate remarks to local news channels, the minister said Islamabad would ""stringently enforce international laws at its borders with Afghanistan"" to restrict the movement of smuggled goods.The media outlet reported him as saying that the decision would also ""thwart the infiltration of terrorists"".","Pakistan has approved a new military campaign named Azm-e-Istehkam, meaning ""Resolve for Stability"" The move is to root out domestic terror threats and stem the activities of fighters crossing over from Afghanistan.

Taliban to press international community on Afghanistan sanctions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/taliban-to-press-international-community-on-afghanistan-sanctions/articleshow/111404197.cms,"DOHA: Taliban authorities said Monday they would press the international community over economic sanctions as they attended a UN-hosted summit in Doha with special representatives to Afghanistan for the first time.The two-day meeting began on Sunday and is the third such summit to be held in Qatar in a little over a year, but the first to include the Taliban authorities who seized power in Afghanistan in 2021.Writing on X, formerly Twitter, senior foreign ministry official Zakir Jalaly said the Taliban government delegation would use Monday's meetings to address ""financial and banking sanctions"" and the ""challenges"" these pose to Afghanistan's economy.His statement followed an opening salvo late Sunday by the head of the Taliban delegation, spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid, as he addressed more than 20 envoys and UN officials.""Afghans are asking why they are being ganged up on, on the basis of unilateral and multilateral sanctions,"" Mujahid said as he questioned whether ongoing sanctions were ""fair practice"" after ""wars and insecurity for almost half a century as a result of foreign invasions and interference"".The talks are being held to discuss increasing engagement with the impoverished country of more than 40 million and a more coordinated response, including economic issues and counter-narcotics efforts.In the aftermath of the Taliban's return to power, the international community has wrestled with its approach to Afghanistan's new rulers.The Taliban government in Kabul has not been officially recognised by any other government since it took power.It has imposed a strict interpretation of Islam, with women subjected to laws characterised by the UN as ""gender apartheid"".The inclusion of a Taliban delegation but the exclusion of civil society and women's rights groups sparked outrage, with organisations accusing the UN and attendees of legitimising Taliban government policies.""Caving into the Taliban's conditions to secure their participation in the talks would risk legitimising their gender-based institutionalised system of oppression,"" Amnesty International chief Agnes Callamard said in a statement ahead of the talks.The Taliban authorities have repeatedly said the rights of all citizens are guaranteed under Islamic law.Mujahid said diplomats should ""find ways of interaction and understanding rather than confrontation"", despite ""natural"" differences in policy.""The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan is keen on engaging constructively with Western nations as well,"" Mujahid said.""Like any sovereign state, we uphold certain religious and cultural values and public aspirations that must be acknowledged.""",Taliban authorities attend a UN-hosted summit in Doha with special representatives to Afghanistan for the first time.
