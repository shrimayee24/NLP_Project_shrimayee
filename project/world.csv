Rape And Murder: Fresh Allegations Arise in R G Kar Hospital Rape Case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/fresh-allegations-arise-in-r-g-kar-hospital-rape-case/articleshow/112479152.cms,"KOLKATA: A viral audio that is being shared over social media and instant messaging platforms since Sunday night has raised fresh questions about who else may be involved in the brutal rape and murder of the second year PGT doctor at R G Kar Hospital early on Friday.TOI, however, couldn’t confirm the authenticity of the contents of the audio.While cops arrested a 35-year-old civic volunteer, Sanjay Roy , in less than 24 hours after the crime came to light and stressed that only one person was responsible, the viral audio — purportedly a phone conversation between an intern of the same hospital and a PGT doctor of another hospital — has raised fresh concerns.The conversation in the audio starts with the PGT asking the intern to tell him the real story behind whatever has come up in the public forum in this case, to which the intern says the whole movement is staged and is apparently controlled by the principal and his subordinates.“It feels good that outsiders are doing so much depending on us. But, we are not sustainable by ourselves. He (Sanjay Roy) has been made a scapegoat. With that the authorities wanted us to forget it. But, they don’t know that IQ is there, that it is not possible for him to do,” the intern is heard saying.The intern goes on to say that the post-mortem report shows that the injuries on the woman are not the work of one person but at least two or three, to which the PGT asks: “Who could it be? What do you suspect?”The intern replies that it is the work of another intern with a considerable political background.“His family is quite high-ranking. I can’t take the name. That will be my problem. It’s sad that my own batchmate has done it. So many games are being played to protect him,” he is heard saying.While CP Vineet Goyal had stressed that involvement of multiple people was a rumour and asked protesting students not to pay heed to it, multiple forensic sciences officials TOI spoke to said throttling needs two hands and smothering one.In the audio, the intern is heard pleading the PGT to garner support from outside.“Don’t expect anything from RG Kar where the accused is hiding, where nothing is being addressed in general body meeting, where the principal comes and says why would she sleep there at night?” he is heard saying.","A viral audio that is being shared over social media and instant messaging platforms since Sunday night has raised fresh questions about who else may be involved in the brutal rape and murder of the second year PGT doctor at R G Kar Hospital early on Friday.

"RG Kar: Kolkata doctor murder: Miscreants vandalize RG Kar Hospital in post-midnight protest, pelt stones at police, teargas fired",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/chaos-vandalism-at-rg-kar-post-midnight-amid-protest-against-kolkata-doctor-rape-murder/articleshow/112533520.cms,"‘What have we not done?’: Kolkata Police Commissioner

Trinamool MP Abhishek condemns the violence

BJP Leader Suvendu Adhikari alleges TMC involvement

Nationwide protests and CBI probe

In the early hours of Thursday morning, chaos erupted at Kolkata's RG Kar Medical College and Hospital after a group of miscreants broke through barricades, manhandled protesting doctors, and damaged hospital property, including the emergency building where the body of a woman doctor was found last week, according to police reports.The incident occurred during midnight protests by women outraged over the horrific rape and murder of the doctor at the hospital.The vandalism took place as 'Reclaim the Nights' protest rallies—organized to demand justice for the brutal rape and murder of a young PGT doctor—converged at the hospital from various parts of the city.Police reported that a group of nearly 40 people, allegedly disguised as protesters, entered the hospital premises, vandalized property, and pelted stones at police officers, prompting the police to fire teargas to disperse the mob. Emergency beds occupied by patients were also vandalized, forcing doctors, nurses, and police officers to flee. The intruders, who were dressed in shorts and vests, were not part of the initial rallies.In addition to the damage to the hospital, a police vehicle and several two-wheelers were also vandalized, with some police officers injured in the violence.The 'Reclaim the Night' campaign, which gained momentum through social media, began at 11:55 pm, coinciding with Independence Day celebrations, and spread across key areas in both small towns and big cities, including several landmarks in Kolkata.As tensions escalated, Kolkata Police Commissioner Vineet Goyal arrived at the scene around 2 am and criticized the media for what he called a malicious campaign against the police.Commissioner Goyal defended the actions of the Kolkata Police, saying they had left no stone unturned in the investigation. He asserted that even the CBI would not be able to prove that the police were trying to shield anyone.""What has happened here is the result of a wrong media campaign, a malicious campaign against Kolkata police. What has Kolkata police not done? We have done everything in this case... We have tried to satisfy the family, but rumors are being spread... I am extremely angry. We have not done anything wrong. Because of this malicious campaign, Kolkata police have lost the trust of the people. We have never claimed that there is only one suspect; we are waiting for scientific evidence, and it takes time... I can't arrest a young PG student based on rumors—it's against my conscience. There is immense pressure from the media, but we have acted appropriately. Now, the CBI is investigating. They'll conduct a fair probe, and we will fully support them... False propaganda is circulating that bones are broken, this is done, that is done, but unfortunately, it's not supported by scientific evidence,"" Goyal said.He further said, ""Please don't spread the rumours. We are verifying everything... We are constantly interrogating everyone who was there. On the first night, the additional CP was here and he had interrogated everyone personally. Just by rumour-mongering and bringing distrust to the citizens, I think this city is the loser, not Vineet Goyal... You must ask CBI, the kind of work the officers have done in the span of these four days and the city has given them this, this is demoralising for them.""Trinamool MP and Mamata Banerjee's nephew, Abhishek Banerjee, condemned the vandalism at RG Kar Medical College, saying it had crossed all acceptable limits. ""The hooliganism and vandalism at RG Kar tonight have exceeded all acceptable limits. As a public representative, I just spoke with @CPKolkata, urging him to ensure that every individual responsible for today’s violence is identified, held accountable, and made to face the law within the next 24 hours, regardless of their political affiliations. The demands of the protesting doctors are fair and justified. This is the minimum they should expect from the government. Their safety and security must be prioritized,"" Abhishek posted on X.BJP leader and Leader of the Opposition, Suvendu Adhikari, alleged that the vandalism was orchestrated by ""TMC goons"" sent by Mamata Banerjee. ""Mamata Banerjee has sent her TMC goons to the apolitical protest rally near RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. She thinks that she is the most shrewd person in the world and that people won't figure out the cunning plan of her goons, disguised as protesters, mixing with the crowd and carrying out vandalism inside RG Kar Medical College and Hospital,"" Adhikari said in a post on X.Adhikari also alleged that the miscreants were given safe passage by the police. ""They were given safe passage by the police, who either ran away or looked the other way so that these thugs could enter the hospital premises and destroy areas containing crucial evidence so that it doesn't get picked up by the CBI,"" he claimed.The horrific rape and murder of the on-duty doctor have sent shockwaves across the nation, sparking silent protests, candlelight marches, and 'Reclaim the Night' rallies in several parts of the country. Doctors' associations are demanding assurances of minimum security in their workplaces.The semi-naked body of the 32-year-old woman was found on the morning of August 9 in the seminar hall of the government-run hospital in Kolkata.Amid the ongoing tussle between the Trinamool Congress and the BJP over the tragedy, the investigation into the heinous crime has been handed over to the CBI. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has assured full support to the CBI, emphasizing the need to solve the case at the earliest.Kolkata Police civic volunteer Sanjay Roy has been arrested in connection with the case. However, doctors, citing autopsy report findings, believe that more than one person was involved in the assault and murder of the doctor.The Calcutta High Court on Tuesday ordered the transfer of the investigation from the Kolkata Police to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).","Violence erupted at Kolkata's RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on Thursday morning.

He clarified that the intention behind this remembrance was not political, but to reject divisive politics. The tragedy did not receive the recognition in history that it deserved due to various political reasons, he said.MoS Sukanta Majumdar recalled the background of 'Banga-Bhanga' (Partition of Bengal) imposed by the British in 1905.

Supreme Court Warns of Bail Cancellation Over Sopan Gade’s Celebratory Rally,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/irked-by-rally-supreme-court-threatens-to-cancel-bail/articleshow/112504924.cms,"Times View It has happened in the past that politicians accused of serious crimes have celebrated the occasion of being given bail like an acquittal. The apex court has rightly warned against over the top displays on such occasions.

NEW DELHI: Politicians , imprisoned for alleged crimes, are typically greeted by unruly celebrations by their supporters when they get bail, leading to inconvenience to the public. In what could be a cautionary tale for them, SC Tuesday took a serious view of the practice and threatened to cancel the bail it had granted to an alleged criminal of Maharashtra's Newasa for taking out a motorcade and getting showered with flowers by a JCB machine.Sopan Gade of Newasa faced several criminal cases, including a murder case of 2013. His bail plea in the murder case was rejected by trial court and Bombay HC bench at Aurangabad considering his criminal antecedents, absconding during pendency of trial and tactics to delay trial.On Tuesday, the complainant in the case, which related to murder of advocate Riyaz Pathan, complained before a bench of Justices B R Gavai and K V Viswanathan that days after SC granted bail considering that he has undergone almost a decade of incarceration, the accused roamed around Newasa town in a huge motorcade apparently to terrorise witnesses.Seeking cancellation of Sopan Gade's bail, complainant Asif Khan told SC that ""On Dec 16 last year, to create his fear among the people, Sopan organised a rally in his four-wheeler accompanied by 100 to 150 four-wheelers and 70 to 80 two-wheelers. It was telecast live on social media. They burst crackers, showered flowers from JCB to felicitate the accused. The motorcade caused a traffic jam on the NH for five to six hours.""The bench was furious and said it has become a habit with leaders to go around the town with supporters in a rally after getting bail. When Sopan's counsel said his supporters arranged the rally, the bench said, ""You file an apology for going in a motorcade and organising a rally. You also file an undertaking that you will never indulge in any such activities in future.""","Sopan Gade of Newasa faced several criminal cases, including a murder case of 2013.

JAMMU: Captain Deepak Singh of 48 Rashtriya Rifles died of bullet wounds Wednesday while leading an overnight counteroffensive against a group of three to four heavily-armed Pakistani terrorists in Assar of Doda district — marking the 17th security casualty in J&K since May, with 13 fatalities in Jammu region and an additional four killed in Kashmir.Captain Singh’s team gunned down a terrorist, while a civilian was wounded in the crossfire. Security sources said there could be more terrorist casualties as four blood-soaked rucksacks and clothing were discovered at the site, alongside an American M4 carbine with an infrared thermal scope, an AK-series assault rifle, grenades, and ammunition. Thermal scopes detect heat signatures emitted by people, allowing them to function equally well during the day or night.“Warlike stores have been found. Bloodstains on the grass and rocks were seen at the site, indicating wounds,” an official said. “Firing continues. Operation is ongoing.”The 25-year-old Captain, enlisted in 2020 following his graduation from NDA, was the sixth soldier from Uttarakhand to die in J&K this year, after five men from 22 Garhwal Rifles were killed in an ambush on a two-truck patrol in Kathua district on July 8.He leaves behind his parents and two elder sisters, both married. His father Mahesh Singh was an inspector with Uttarakhand police and served as confidential assistant to the DGP before his retirement earlier this year. The family, originally from Kumaon, currently resides in Kuanwala on the outskirts of Dehradun.Earlier fatalities in Jammu zone included a soldier in Poonch on July 23, a Captain and three soldiers from 10 Rashtriya Rifles in Doda on July 15, and the five soldiers from 22 Garhwal Rifles on July 8. A CRPF constable was also killed in Kathua on June 12, and Corporal Vikky Pahade died in an ambush on an IAF convoy in Poonch on May 4.In Kashmir, two soldiers were killed in Anantnag on Aug 10, and two others died in separate gunfights in Kupwara on July 24 and 27.Officials said security forces launched a search operation late Tuesday afternoon in the dense Shivgarh-Assar forest after receiving intelligence about suspected Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists hiding there. As the troops advanced, the terrorists fired, triggering a shootout that continued till late after nightfall. Gunfire resumed at first light and Captain Singh, who was leading from the front, was struck in the chest. He was taken to a military hospital but could not be saved.Security sources suspect that the terrorists involved in the Assar gunfight may be the same who escaped a brief shooting Sunday at Basantgarh in Udhampur. Assar, located about 91km from Doda town via NH244 and 40km from Patnitop in Udhampur district, had been untouched by the summer’s terrorist violence.Official sources estimated that of the 70 to 80 Pakistani terrorists active in J&K, nearly 55 to 60 are in Jammu zone. The recent spike in violence has been attributed to “highly trained intruders” from Pakistan, operating in small groups of three to four and armed with sophisticated weapons such as M4 carbines, and using advanced techs like iridium satellite phones and thermal imagery.The capability of these groups to coordinate attacks remains a major challenge for security forces in the remote and rugged landscape, dotted with deep gorges, thick woods, mountain caves, and other natural hideouts that provide ample cover.A landmine blast along the LoC in Mandi area of Poonch district injured a soldier and two porters Wednesday. The injured have been identified as Havildar Inderjeet Singh and porters Shakeel Hussain and Neeraj Choudhary. All three were immediately shifted to a military hospital.The forward areas along the LoC are lined with landmines as part of an anti-infiltration obstacle system. These landmines can sometimes be displaced due to soil erosion and heavy rain, leading to accidental blasts.On Jan 18, “Agniveer” soldier Ajay Singh from Ludhiana was killed and two others were injured in a similar landmine blast in the Nowshera sector of Rajouri district.","Captain Deepak Singh of 48 Rashtriya Rifles died of bullet wounds Wednesday.

What does the

postmortem report

say?

The report said the death was due to smothering and throttling.

Prima facie, death has been due to gagging and there were multiple signs of injuries and struggle on the body.

The mouth and throat were constantly pressed to prevent screaming. The throat was strangled to suffocate. The thyroid cartilage broke due to this strangulation.

There were blood stains on the face, eyes and face, scratch marks on various parts of the body and bleeding from the private parts.

There were injuries on the lips, abdomen, right hand and fingers while a collar bone was broken.

There are aberration marks and bruise marks on the victim’s face, on the eyes till the neck.

The scratch marks on the woman's face, likely caused by the accused's fingernails, suggest that she desperately tried to fight back.

The report mentions that the accused “got certain advantage as the victim was in deep sleep at the time of the attack.”

She had tried to resist, and there were deep mark injuries and scratches on the hands of the accused as well.

The report, however, said that there have been no fracture or breakage of the collar bone or pelvis as reported earlier in the initial phase of observation.

What are preliminary forensic findings?

The scratch mark injuries on Sanjay’s body matched with the skin and blood samples collected from the nails of the victim.

Fact check: What do the claims and police responses reveal about the case?

A source from the Kolkata Police revealed that a claim circulating involves semen from three individuals being found on the doctor’s body. However, a police officer said, “It is impossible to distinguish semen from three individuals with the naked eye during an autopsy.” Medical science defines what an adult male is capable of, and what is being circulated is scientifically impossible, source added.

The second claim circulating on social media is that the woman’s collarbone and pelvic guard were broken. However, police say that based on the autopsy report, she did not have any broken bones.

The third claim is that the Kolkata Police informed the family about a possible suicide, but police say the family confirmed the call did not come from them.

Fourthly, there is a rumor that a police officer offered a large sum of money to silence the murdered doctor’s father. However, the police clarified that, following the Nirbhaya case, the state is required to provide financial compensation to the families of victims of murder, acid attacks, rape, and molestation.

This summit is pivotal in efforts to de-escalate tensions in the Middle East and avert a potential regional conflict , especially given recent threats from Iran and Hezbollah following the assassinations of Hamas and Hezbollah leaders in Tehran and Beirut.According to Axios, President Biden views the agreement as essential to reducing the risk of a broader regional war. CIA Director Bill Burns and President Biden's top Middle East adviser Brett McGurk will join the meeting, alongside Qatar's Prime Minister Mohammed Bin Abdul Rahman al-Thani, Mossad Director David Barnea, and Egyptian intelligence chief Abbas Kamel.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu participated in extensive discussions on Wednesday with key officials and heads of Israel's security and intelligence services. These discussions lasted over five hours and focused on strategies for the Doha talks .Two senior Israeli officials revealed that Netanyahu agreed to slightly expand the mandate given to Israeli negotiators, a move aimed at facilitating more meaningful discussions. While this new flexibility is intended to enhance negotiation prospects, it remains uncertain if it will be sufficient to achieve a final agreement.Despite Qatar's assurances to the White House and State Department that Hamas will be included in the discussions, Hamas officials have stated they will not directly participate. However, they are open to meeting with mediators afterward to review Israel's proposals.A source close to the negotiations mentioned that Hamas representatives in Doha would not attend the talks but are willing to evaluate Israel's proposals through mediators. ""The mediators will update Hamas representatives and assess whether Israel presents a serious and practical proposal,"" the source noted.During the Wednesday meeting, Israeli security and intelligence heads warned Netanyahu that delays could jeopardize hostage lives, stressing the urgency of reaching an agreement. They also reported Hamas's claim that one male hostage had been killed and two female hostages critically wounded, though Israeli intelligence has yet to confirm these claims.One key discussion point was the potential connection between a hostage deal and a ceasefire in Gaza, alongside the risk of retaliation from Iran and Hezbollah. The White House has been actively involved in monitoring the situation, with President Biden and Vice President Harris receiving briefings on ongoing diplomatic efforts.Secretary of State Antony Blinken emphasized to his Egyptian and Qatari counterparts the importance of regional cooperation. ""No party in the region should take actions that would undermine efforts to reach a deal,"" Blinken stated.","Senior officials from the US, Qatar, Egypt, and Israel are set to gather in Doha on Thursday for crucial talks aimed at finalizing a hostage release and ceasefire agreement for Gaza.

This move follows Kyiv's recent surprise incursion into Russian territory, leaving Moscow scrambling to respond.According to Reuters, Zelenskyy discussed establishing military commandant offices in newly occupied areas and noted the growing number of Russian prisoners of war , which could facilitate exchanges for Ukrainian fighters.Interior minister Ihor Klymenko emphasized that the buffer zone aims to protect Ukrainian border communities from Russian strikes.Ukraine’s Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk announced a 24-hour hotline for Kursk region residents wishing to evacuate to Ukraine. ""Due to the possible deterioration of the humanitarian situation in the adjacent territories of the Kursk region of the Russian Federation, Ukraine must be ready to receive Russian refugees.

US Navy: US Navy unveils longest-range missile: Will AIM-174B be a game-changer in Indo-Pacific tensions?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-navy-unveils-longest-range-missile-will-aim-174b-be-a-game-changer-in-indo-pacific-tensions/articleshow/112537942.cms,"The US Navy has introduced the AIM-174B , an extremely long-range air-to-air missile , in the Indo-Pacific, aiming to counter China’s aerial dominance. This deployment is part of a broader strategy to enhance US power projection as tensions in the region escalate.Operational since July, the AIM-174B, derived from Raytheon’s SM-6 air defence missile, is now the longest-range missile ever fielded by the US.Capable of striking targets up to 400 km (250 miles) away, it surpasses the range of China’s PL-15 missile , providing US jets a critical edge in aerial engagements, Reuters reported.One of the significant advantages of the AIM-174B is its ability to fly several times farther than the AIM-120 AMRAAM, the previous long-range US missile. This capability allows the AIM-174B to keep Chinese threats at bay, protecting key US assets such as aircraft carriers and enabling strikes on high-value Chinese targets, including command-and-control planes.""The United States can ensure the safety of their important assets, such as carrier groups, and launch long-range strikes on PLA targets,"" said Chieh Chung, a researcher at the Taipei-based think tank Association of Strategic Foresight.The West has long struggled to match this level of capability. The AIM-120, the standard long-range missile for US aircraft, has a maximum range of about 150 km (93 miles), forcing US jets to fly deeper into contested territories and exposing them to significant risks. In a potential conflict in the South China Sea or a scenario involving Taiwan, the US Navy would have to operate within a few hundred kilometres of Chinese forces, increasing the danger to US aircraft carriers due to anti-ship attacks.The AIM-174B changes this dynamic, allowing the US to keep PLA carrier-hunting aircraft out of firing range and even threaten Chinese planes attacking Taiwan, according to Cheih Chung.""The big thing is that it lets the United States push in a little bit further into the South China Sea during a conflict,"" said a senior US defence technical analyst. ""And it's going to potentially change Chinese behaviour because it's going to hold large, slow, unmanoeuvrable aircraft at greater risk.""For decades, the United States relied on the advantage of stealth fighters like the F-117, F-22, and F-35, making missiles like the AIM-120 sufficient. However, the advent of Chinese stealth aircraft , such as the J-20, and the longer-range PL-15 missile it can carry, has eroded the US edge. Kelly Grieco, a senior fellow at the Stimson Center, noted that a stealthy Chinese aircraft could theoretically spot non-stealthy US aircraft and shoot them down well outside the range where they could even fight back.""If a Chinese fighter can outrange an American fighter, it means they can get the first shot. It's hard to outrun something that's travelling at Mach 4,"" she said.The AIM-174B was developed to quickly address this need. In parallel, the US Air Force is working on a separate program, the secretive Lockheed Martin AIM-260, which aims to develop an extremely long-range air-to-air missile small enough for stealth aircraft to carry internally.China is also developing missiles with longer ranges than the PL-15. However, Justin Bronk, an airpower expert at London's Royal United Services Institute, pointed out that the radar on these launching aircraft might not be able to spot targets at such extended distances.""If you go too big and too heavy with the missiles, you end up trading off fuel for the aircraft,"" he added.The use of the Raytheon SM-6, initially designed for a ship-launched air defense role, means that production lines are already available, and funding exists for more than 100 SM-6 missiles a year. Although Raytheon declined to comment on how many AIM-174Bs would be produced, its versatility opens up possibilities beyond the AIM-174B, such as fitting the missile with an anti-radar seeker to disrupt surface-to-air missile batteries from long range.Even with limited numbers, the AIM-174B's deployment alters the strategic calculus in a potential regional conflict . As a senior technical analyst noted, ""If this is enough to push China’s high-value aircraft way back, then you don’t need many. The threat has caused the adversary to change their behaviour... It makes a South China Sea scenario easier.""","The US Navy has introduced the AIM-174B, an extremely long-range air-to-air missile. The missile is now the longest-range missile ever fielded by the US. It surpasses the range of China’s PL-15 missile, providing US jets a critical edge in aerial engagements.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112538302,imgsize-380618,width-400,resizemode-4/112538302.jpg"

Her resignation comes in the wake of intense national scrutiny following pro-Palestinian protests at the university and other campuses across the United States.The protests, which erupted in response to US support for Israel's campaign against Hamas in Gaza, became a flashpoint in debates about Israel and Palestine.At Columbia, critics accused the protests of veering into anti-Semitism and intimidation, leading to Shafik being questioned before Congress alongside other university presidents. They were accused of failing to ensure the safety of Jewish students on campus.Protesters, including some Jewish individuals, contended that the criticisms were conflating anti-Israel sentiment with anti-Semitism and that allegations of hate incidents were being used to deflect from calls for a ceasefire amidst the escalating civilian casualties in Gaza.In an email to the Columbia community, Shafik said, “Over the summer, I have been able to reflect and have decided that my moving on at this point would best enable Columbia to traverse the challenges ahead.” She emphasized her desire for new leadership to be in place before the academic term begins, according to the Columbia Spectator.The nationwide protests saw buildings occupied and occasional clashes with police. Pro-Israel counter-protesters also clashed with demonstrators at times. US House Speaker Mike Johnson, who had earlier condemned the protests as ""terrorism,"" welcomed Shafik’s resignation in a statement on Wednesday.The ongoing conflict in Gaza has resulted in significant casualties, with Hamas's attack on October 7 killing 1,198 people in Israel, according to AFP.

However, the quota system was reinstated this year, triggering further protests that ultimately led to the toppling of the government and the prime minister's exile.The former presidential candidate also highlighted the concerning trend of radicals targeting Hindu minorities amidst the chaos. He emphasized that ""bloodshed is the endpoint of grievance and victimhood"" and suggested that the United States should learn from the lessons unfolding in Bangladesh.""Here's what happened: Bangladesh fought a bloody war for its independence in 1971. Hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshi civilians were raped and murdered. It was a tragedy, and it was rightly mourned. But in its aftermath, Bangladesh implemented a quota system for jobs in their civil service: 80% of the jobs were allocated to specific social groups (war veterans, rape victims, underrepresented residents, etc.), and only 20% were allocated based on merit,"" he said in a post on X.""The quota system proved to be a disaster. In 2018, protests led Bangladesh to scrap most of the quotas, but the victim-patrons fought back…and the quota system was reinstated this year. That triggered more protests which toppled the government, and the prime minister fled. Once chaos begins, it can't easily be reined in. Radicals are now targeting Hindu minorities. A quota conflict created to rectify the wrongs of rape and violence in 1971 is now leading to more rape and violence in 2024. Bloodshed is the endpoint of grievance and victimhood. It's hard not to look at Bangladesh and wonder what lessons we would do well to learn right here at home,"" he added.Since the ousting of Sheikh Hasina's government on August 5, Bangladesh has been experiencing a volatile political situation. According to reports from two Hindu organizations in the country, the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council and the Bangladesh Puja Udjapan Parishad, members of minority communities in Bangladesh have faced at least 205 incidents of attacks across 52 districts. As a result, thousands of Bangladeshi Hindus have been attempting to seek refuge in neighboring India to escape the ongoing violence.","Vivek Ramaswamy criticized the quota system implemented in Bangladesh after the country's bloody war for independence in 1971. He argued that the system proved to be a disaster, leading to protests in 2018 that temporarily scrapped most of the quotas. The quota system was reinstated this year, triggering further protests that ultimately led to the toppling of the government.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112509633,imgsize-1396890,width-400,resizemode-4/112509633.jpg"
'Unduly provocative': Why Israeli minister's prayer at Al-Aqsa mosque has irked the West,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/unduly-provocative-why-israeli-ministers-prayer-at-al-aqsa-mosque-has-irked-the-west/articleshow/112509097.cms,"'We must win this war'

Gvir garners condemnation from West

US urges Netanyahu to prevent 'provocative actions'

Why the controversy?

Israeli minister Itamar Ben Gvir drew criticism from various quarters after he, along with hundreds of Israelies, entered Jerusalem 's Al-Aqsa mosque compound and performed prayers -- this comes as the Middle East remains on edge amid fear of anticipated large-scale Iran and Lebanon attacks in the wake of Hamas chief's assassination Ben Gvir and some 2,250 other Israelis on Tuesday entered the compound in groups, singing Jewish hymns under the protection of Israeli police, an official from the Waqf, the Jordanian body that is the custodian of the site, told news agency AFP.""Minister Ben Gvir, instead of maintaining the status quo at the mosque is supervising the Judaisation operation and trying to change the situation inside Al-Aqsa mosque,"" the official told AFP on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak on the issue.Israeli police also ""imposed restrictions"" on Muslim worshippers trying to enter the mosque, he said.Ben Gvir posted a video statement on social media platform X, which he filmed inside the compound himself, vowing to win the war in Gaza.""We must win this war. We must win and not go to the talks in Doha or Cairo,"" he said, in an apparent reference to US-backed negotiations for a truce and hostage release deal for Gaza scheduled to resume on August 15.""We can defeat Hamas .. we must bring them down to their knees,"" Ben Gvir said.Ben Gvir garnered global condemnation after the mosque visit as he also vowed to ""defeat Hamas"" in Gaza in a video he filmed during the visit.The European Union (EU) condemned ""provocations"" by Gvirm and called it ""violation of status quo"".""The EU strongly condemns the provocations by Israeli Min. Ben Gvir who, during his visit to the Holy Sites, advocated for the violation of the status quo,"" EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell wrote on X.France's foreign ministry also stepped in to condemn Gvir for defying the ban on Jewish prayer at the Al-Aqsa mosque, calling it an unacceptable ""provocation"".The United Nations also slammed the minister, calling his visit ""unduly provocative "".US Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to prevent further ""provocative actions"" after Gvir's Al-Aqsa visit.Strongly criticising the Israeli minister's visit, Blinken said that Gvir showed ""blatant disregard"" for the status quo.""Prime Minister Netanyahu's office has made clear that the actions of Minister Ben Gvir are inconsistent with Israeli policy. We will look to the government of Israel to prevent similar incidents in the future,"" Blinken said.""These provocative actions only exacerbate tensions at a pivotal moment when all focus should be on the ongoing diplomatic efforts to achieve a ceasefire agreement and secure the release of all hostages and create the conditions for broader regional stability,"" he said.Al-Aqsa mosque has been a point of contention for a long as it is the third holiest site in Islam and also the most sacred in Judaism as Jews revere the site of the ancient temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.Jews and non-Muslims are allowed to visit the mosque compound in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem during predefined hours but are not allowed to display religious symbols or offer prayers.Interestingly, this is not the first time that Ben Gvir has defied the Israeli government's ban on Jewish prayer at the Al-Aqsa compound.Last month, Ben Gvir said he had prayed inside the mosque compound against the rules that allow Jewish visits but forbid prayer.","Israeli minister Itamar Ben Gvir drew criticism from various quarters after he, along with hundreds of Israelies, entered Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque compound and performed prayers.

The case involves the police shooting that killed grocery store owner Abu Sayed in Dhaka's Mohammadpur area on July 19.The threat was made shortly after the case was filed, with the caller contacting the plaintiff from a French phone number around 2.30pm on Tuesday.The caller reportedly questioned the plaintiff about the consequences of filing a case against Sheikh Hasina, asking about his home location, his commitment to the case, and whether he had received any money related to it.""Caller asked where is my house, whether I can stay there, whether I have received any money in this case, how far I will go with this case, whether I can survive,"" the man told Dhaka Tribune.Sheikh Hasina, who recently resigned as PM and fled the country amid political unrest, is one of the accused in this case.

Other notable figures named in the case include Habibur Rahman, the former DMP Commissioner, and Biplob Kumar Sarker, former DMP Joint Commissioner.Hasina’s resignation was preceeded by a student-led uprising and allegations of widespread human rights violations during her 15-year tenure, including the extrajudicial killings of political opponents.After her resignation, the military appointed Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus to lead a caretaker government to restore stability and initiate democratic reforms in Bangladesh.","Man who filed murder case against Sheikh Hasina received death threat over the phone.

Mohammed Abu Al-Qumsan 's life was shattered just three days after the birth of his twins, Asser and Aysel.What should have been a time of celebration turned into unimaginable grief when an Israeli airstrike in Deir Al-Balah, central Gaza Strip, claimed the lives of the newborns, their mother, and their grandmother.On the day of the tragedy, Mohammed had left home to obtain birth certificates for his son and daughter, who were just four days old.While at a local government office, he received the news that his home had been bombed. The strike that killed his entire family occurred while he was away, robbing him of the chance to hold and cherish his newborns in what should have been their first days of life.“I don’t know what happened,” Mohammed tearfully recounted, still in shock from the sudden loss.“I am told it was a shell that hit the house. I didn’t even have the time to celebrate them,” Mohammed told APAccording to Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry, 115 infants have been born and killed during the ongoing conflict, which began on October 7th following a deadly attack on Israel by Hamas-led gunmen. The attack left 1,200 Israelis dead and sparked a massive military offensive on Gaza that has since claimed over 39,790 Palestinian lives, as reported by the health ministry.The family had sought refuge in the central Gaza Strip after following Israeli army instructions to evacuate Gaza City in the war’s early weeks. Despite their efforts to find safety, they became casualties of the relentless bombing campaign.The Israeli military has stated that it aims to avoid civilian casualties and places the blame on Hamas for operating in densely populated areas. However, the devastation continues, with numerous shelters and civilian homes destroyed in the crossfire.The airstrike on Mohammed's home is one of many that have turned family homes into graves. On Saturday, another strike on a school building sheltering displaced Palestinians in Gaza City killed more than 70 people, adding to the mounting civilian death toll.As Mohammed Abu Al-Qumsan prays for his lost family, the world witnesses the tragic cost of war—a cost that has left countless families grieving in its wake, their lives forever changed by the violence that shows no sign of abating.",Mohammed Abu Al-Qumsan's twins Asser and Aysel were just four days old when they were killed in an Israeli airstrike.

US elections: Google confirms Iranian hackers targeting Harris and Trump presidential campaigns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-elections-google-confirms-iranian-hackers-targeting-harris-and-trump-presidential-campaigns/articleshow/112537263.cms,"Google confirmed that Iranian-backed hackers are targeting the presidential campaigns of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump . The hacker group, known as ""APT42"" and linked to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, has been targeting high-profile individuals and organizations in both Israel and the United States, including political campaigns.According to Google's threat report, APT42 has been attempting to compromise personal accounts associated with President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and Trump.The Harris campaign acknowledged being targeted by foreign hackers, following Trump's campaign’s earlier suggestion of Iranian involvement. “In July, the campaign legal and security teams were notified by the FBI that we were targeted by a foreign actor influence operation,” a Harris campaign official said reported AFP. However, they reported no security breaches.APT42 uses sophisticated phishing techniques to gather information and deceive victims into revealing login credentials for accounts like Gmail. These techniques often involve posing as reputable organizations or creating fake video meeting pages to lure targets.Google's report highlighted that APT42 had attempted to hack into personal email accounts of about a dozen individuals linked to Biden and Trump this year. The company also disrupted several of the group’s phishing campaigns and blocked numerous login attempts. Additionally, the group accessed the personal Gmail account of a prominent political consultant.“APT42 is a sophisticated, persistent threat actor with a demonstrated ability to run simultaneous phishing campaigns, particularly targeting Israel and the United States,” Google noted.The US State Department issued a warning to Iran on Monday about potential consequences for interfering in the election following the Trump campaign’s breach announcement. The Trump campaign claimed that Iran was behind the breach, which involved the leak of private documents, and cautioned media outlets against publishing the documents, accusing them of aiding “America’s enemies.”This stance contrasts with Trump’s 2016 remarks, when he infamously encouraged Russia to find Hillary Clinton’s emails, amid US intelligence findings that Russia had intervened to support his election.","Google confirms that Iranian-backed hackers are targeting the presidential campaigns of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.

The suspected hack of Donald Trump’s campaign is the latest in a series of aggressive actions attributed to Tehran.Iran, often labeled a “chaos agent” in cyber conflicts, has ramped up efforts to influence US politics. Recent activities include encouraging protests over Israel’s Gaza conflict, impersonating American activists, and creating fake news networks.Despite Russia and China being significant cyber threats, Iran’s heightened aggression signals a new level of interference aimed at disrupting the election.Sean Minor, a former US Army information warfare expert, notes the increase in cyber operations as the election approaches. ""As we get closer, we suspect these networks will get more aggressive,"" he said, as quoted by AP.The FBI is probing the Trump campaign hack and similar efforts targeting President Joe Biden’s campaign. Trump’s team reported unauthorized access to internal documents, later leaked to the media. While Trump dismissed the leaked material’s importance, the campaign has pointed to Iran, citing a Microsoft report on attempted hacks by Iranian military intelligence.Iran has denied involvement, but US intelligence and cybersecurity firms link Tehran to recent cyber operations. Google recently exposed an Iranian Revolutionary Guard group targeting personal emails of individuals associated with Biden and Trump. The connection between this group and the reported hack remains unclear.Iran’s motives include spreading discord, increasing US polarization, and undermining support for Israel. The Iranian government also seeks to impact candidates perceived as hostile to Tehran, such as Trump, who took a hardline stance against Iran during his presidency.Senate intelligence committee leaders issued a warning to Tehran and other adversaries, emphasizing consequences for election interference . ""There will be consequences to interfering in the American democratic process,"" wrote Democratic Sen. Mark Warner and Republican Sen. Marco Rubio.Past Iranian attempts include the 2021 charges against two nationals who posed as Proud Boys to intimidate Democratic voters and recent covert support for anti-Israel protests.Experts warn that the final weeks before an election are particularly vulnerable to foreign interference. ""The spectacle and marketing this gives foreign adversaries can be more of a threat than the actual hack,"" said Gavin Wilde, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.As AI technology advances, disinformation campaigns are becoming more sophisticated. Nevertheless, the Trump campaign hack reportedly involved basic techniques, highlighting ongoing vulnerabilities in digital security.“The tax we pay for being a digital society is that these hacks and leaks are unavoidable,” Wilde concluded. “Whether you’re a business, a campaign, or a government.”","Iran's cyber activities are intensifying, US officials and cybersecurity experts report.

But his feelings for the three of them are different, Politico reported citing Biden's close aides. Biden is angry with Nancy Pelosi, frustrated with Barack Obama and miffed at Schumer.The tension is again at the forefront as the party is preparing for the national convention. Biden told his close aides that he respects Pelosi for she did what she had to do and that Pelosi cares for the party and not feelings but she was ruthless to set aside their long-term relationships. Pelosi and Biden have not spoken after Biden's exit and Pelosi also acknowledged in a recent interview that she loses sleep thinking about her friendship with Biden.Pelosi has repeatedly denied any role in Biden's exit and said she didn’t call anyone but the president in the three weeks prior to Biden’s departure from the race. But Pelosi took calls from rank-and-file Democrats who sought her advice in the days following Biden’s debate performance and before he dropped out of the race, Politico reported.Pelosi said she, her husband and children have only love for the Bidens. “In our family, we have three generations of love for Joe Biden. My husband and I — of course, we’ve known him for a very long time — respect him, love him and Jill. He and Jill are so remarkable, and their family. Our kids have always loved them. I had pictures with him from our children growing up and now our grandchildren growing up,” she said.White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Monday said that Biden “respects” Pelosi and insisted that he has “no hard feelings.”Biden's resentment for Obama stemmed from the fact that Obama tweeted in support of Biden after the debate and then went quiet.

The way Donald Trump is attacking Kamala Harris on 'frivolous' issues, he actually is looking for a theory to explain his defeat to Kamala Harris in November election, if he loses, Trump's former aide said expressing apprehension. “We know one thing for sure: Trump never loses. And so if he’s not declared the winner of 2024, as in 2020, it must be because he was treated unfairly yet again; it was stolen yet again,” John Bolton, who was Trump’s national security adviser and has since become a vocal critic of the former president, told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins last week.Bolton said Trump does not exactly know what his theory is going to be and he is trotting out a number of things.“And I think this is why people need to start thinking more now about how to deny Trump the ability, the day after the election, if he loses, to try and throw the process into chaos again.”In his interview with Elon Musk, Trump said he would go to Venezuela if he loses the election. “If something happens with this election, which would be a horror show, we’ll meet the next time in Venezuela,” Trump said. It was a swipe at Kamala Harris as Trump said Venezuela with is in the middle of a political crisis over the re-election of Nicholas Maduro will be a far safer place than the US if Kamala Harris becomes the president.“We’ll have a meeting and dinner in Venezuela,” Trump said, “Because that’s what’s happening—their crime rate’s coming down and our crime rate’s going through the roof.”According to the latest survey, Kamala Harris is ahead of tied with Donald Trump in six of seven battleground states. The Cook Political Report survey, conducted by the Democratic polling firm BSG and Republican polling firm GS Strategy Group, found Harris leading Trump in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina and Arizona, and tied with Trump in Georgia.

"Trump setting stage for chaos in November if he does not win, political analysts say",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-setting-stage-for-chaos-in-november-if-he-does-not-win-political-analysts-say/articleshow/112529587.cms,"WASHINGTON: Concern is growing in US political circles that Donald Trump is laying the groundwork for rejecting election results if he loses in November. The former President's constant efforts to delegitimize his opponent Kamala Harris by alleging she and her associates staged a ""coup"" against President Biden, exaggerated charges of voter fraud and illegal voting, spurious accusations of ""election interference"" by his rival using artificial intelligence, and his own lack of enthusiasm and discipline in campaigning are among reasons political analysts both on the Democratic and Republican side are fearing a catastrophic meltdown on November 5 if the results are not in his favor.With polls showing Kamala Harris surging ahead in battleground states, inching forward in the so-called sun belt, and even catching up in Republican-leaning states such as Florida, there's palpable panic in the GOP where frustration is mounting that Trump is losing it -- and losing his way. Amid talk that Trump should replace his running mate J.D.Vance -- which some Republicans are now saying was a choice made in haste -- or even retire himself to save the party, there is now public remonstration that the campaign in going off the rails.“I want this campaign to win, but the campaign is not gonna win talking about crowd sizes, it's not gonna win talking about what race Kamala Harris is, and it's not gonna win talking about whether she's dumb. It’s not. You can't win on those things. The American people are smart. Treat them like they're smart,” Nikki Haley, a Trump associate who challenged him for the party nomination and endorsed him after failing to win it, said on Fox News, even berating the network for echoing Trump falsehoods.Some political stalwarts are going so far as to say Trump is simply firebombing the campaign because he's setting the stage for claiming a stolen election if he loses on November 5. ""People need to start thinking more now about how to deny Trump the ability, the day after the election, if he loses, to try and throw the process into chaos again,” Trump former National Security Advisor John Bolton, one of more than 40 Trump White House aides who think he is a vapid, clueless candidate who should not be anywhere near the presidency, said.While many critics are now starting to question Trump's own mental acuity because of his erratic behavior, calling him ""deranged"" and ""delusional,"" some are warning it is a set-up to steal the election. ""Donald Trump may be crazy, but he’s not stupid... there is a method to his madness,” the liberal senator Bernie Sanders warned on Tuesday. “If you can convince your supporters that thousands of people who attended a televised rally do not exist, it will not be hard to convince them that the election returns in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and elsewhere are ‘fake’ and ‘fraudulent.’”Political mavens and pollsters are already zeroing in on Georgia, a closely fought state, as the most likely battleground where both the stolen election scenario will play out. Trump Republicans are reported to have put in place MAGA operatives in county election boards who will refuse to certify the elections if Trump loses, throwing the matter to courts.Similar ground level political skirmishes are already taking place in other battleground states such as Pennsylvania, where Republicans claim they are winning after running up huge leads from the hinterland, before it the lead is erased by Democratic votes from Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, the two major cities, at which point they erupt with charges of voter fraud -- as it happened in 2020.In fact, Trump himself has indicated that he will not accept any result that does not declare him the winner, maintaining that he cannot lose any ""honest election."" Political analysts are already predicting complete chaos on November 5 unless Kamala Harris wins decisively by a margin large enough to forestall any doubts.Republican operatives are now urging Trump to get back on message to run a disciplined, issue-based campaign against an opponent who has the disadvantage of incumbency. The former President is expected to trial a new line of attack focusing on policy at an event in Asheville, North Carolina, another battleground state which he won by only one per cent in 2020.","Concern is growing in US political circles that Donald Trump is laying the groundwork for rejecting election results if he loses in November. Political analysts both on the Democratic and Republican side are fearing a catastrophic meltdown on November 5 if the results are not in his favor. With polls showing Kamala Harris surging ahead in battleground states, there's palpable panic in the GOP where frustration is mounting.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112529796,imgsize-863568,width-400,resizemode-4/112529796.jpg"
Nikki Haley Slams Trump: Nikki Haley says Trump must stop whining about Kamala Harris,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nikki-haley-says-trump-must-stop-whining-about-kamala-harris-talking-about-her-race-dumbness-/articleshow/112529057.cms,"Why Nikki Haley is upset over Trump's campaign

Former GOP presidential hopeful Nikki Haley said Donald Trump and the Republicans should stop whining about Kamala Harris succeeding Joe Biden's contest as they anticipated it pretty well. In an interview with the Fox News, Nikki launched an attack on Kamala Harris and said there's no need for an interview of her; as she can be taken at her word when she says illegal immigrants should be able to vote and be given driver's licenses.“I take her at her word that she wants to raise taxes for households over $100,000, that she wants to add a pharmaceutical tax and a healthcare tax,"" Nikki said. “I take her at her word that she thinks that illegal immigrants should be able to vote and be given driver’s licenses. I take her at her word that she wants to ban fracking and kill a bunch of US jobs. Take her at her word.”“You don’t need an interview from Kamala Harris. I take her at her word"".Nikki Haley said she wants the Trump's campaign to win but it won't be possible if the campaign goes on whining about Kamala Harris -- her crowd size, her race. “I think the campaign needs to focus. That’s the main thing. Look, this is a winnable election, but you need to focus. Who is your target market? Your target market is suburban women, college-educated, independents and conservative Democrats. That’s your target market.”“But the campaign is not going to win talking about crowd sizes. It’s not going to win talking about what race Kamala Harris is. It’s not going to win talking about whether she is dumb. You can’t win on those things. The American people are smart. Treat them like they are smart.”In the last few days, Donald Trump based his campaign on how media is overreporting Kamala Harris rally crown, how Kamala Harris has not given an interview and how she has been copying him. Former House speaker Kevin McCarthy made a similar argument advising Trump to drop the crowd size charge. “Stop questioning the size of her crowds and start questioning her position when it comes to... What did she do as [California] attorney general on crime?” he said. “What did she do when she was supposed to take care of the border as a czar?”","Former GOP presidential hopeful Nikki Haley said Donald Trump and the Republicans should stop whining about Kamala Harris succeeding Joe Biden's contest. “I take her at her word that she thinks that illegal immigrants should be able to vote and be given driver’s licenses,"" she said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112529037,imgsize-900719,width-400,resizemode-4/112529037.jpg"

Pakistan govt accuses ISI ex-chief of political interference,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-govt-accuses-isi-ex-chief-of-political-interference/articleshow/112504585.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif has said former Inter-Services Intelligence chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd) was involved in political events after retirement. Asif’s statement came hours after the military announced Hameed’s arrest, saying field court martial proceedings had been initiated against him.Speaking to a private news channel, Asif accused the retired general of violating the Army Act by interfering in politics in Dec 2022.The act bars officials from engaging in political activity for two years after retirement. “Gen Faiz was definitely involved in the events that took place in the political scene post his retirement,” the minister said.When asked about Hameed’s involvement in the May 9, 2023 riots by alleged supporters of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan, the minister said, “He might have provided a little bit of logistics and provided his experience of conspiracies, and may have defined targets for protesters to inflict maximum damage,” adding, “You can say he might have had the role of a strategic adviser in the May 9 attacks.”Following Imran’s brief arrest in a graft case last year, his supporters had attacked and damaged government and military assets. Hundreds of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) workers and politicians were arrested after the riots. Some still remain behind bars. The military has also initiated army court trials against more than 100 people accused of involvement in the May 9, 2023 violence.Gen Hameed’s arrest has sparked widespread speculation, with many linking the move to his close ties with Imran who has demanded the formation of a judicial commission to probe the ex-spymaster’s arrest to check if it was linked to the May 9 events.Many politicians accused Gen Hameed of using harsh methods and coercive techniques while serving as ISI chief to please his military and political superiors and achieve his own personal goals. Former PM Nawaz Sharif has repeatedly claimed that Hameed, a number of Supreme Court judges, and former army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa were responsible for his ouster in 2017. Hameed was then leading an ISI wing concerned with domestic issues.Gen Hameed had replaced General Asim Munir, the current army chief, as ISI director-general in 2019. Gen Munir was unceremoniously fired by Imran when the latter was PM. The rivalry between these three individuals is partly to blame for Pakistan’s current political turmoil.As the spy agency’s head Gen Hameed had used his authority to threaten and detain Imran’s political rivals, including former PMs, on what they claimed were false accusations. He was seen by opposition politicians as a spy chief who had managed PTI’s past govt activities from behind the scenes.Both Hameed and Imran had approved the policy of repatriating Pakistani Taliban militants from Afghanistan back to Pakistan, which critics claim has led to the return of militancy to Pakistan. Hameed has also been perceived as a supporter of the Afghan Taliban, having backed their takeover of Kabul following the American withdrawal in Aug 2021.In Oct 2021, Gen Bajwa had removed Hameed as spy chief, prompting Khan to oppose the move before eventually agreeing. As a PM, Imran had publicly acknowledged that he wanted to retain Hameed as ISI chief because of the situation in Afghanistan.","Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif has said former Inter-Services Intelligence chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd) was involved in political events after retirement.

Hameed has also been accused of multiple violations of the Pakistan Army Act after retirement.“Complying with the orders of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, a detailed court of inquiry was undertaken by the Pakistan Army to ascertain the correctness of complaints in the Top City (housing society) case made against Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd),” the military said in a statement.The management of Top City had accused the former ISI chief of orchestrating a raid on its offices and residence of its owner, Moeez Khan.

Hameed had sought early retirement from the army in Nov 2022.Hameed was among the six senior-most army generals who were nominated by General HQ as a potential candidate for the two top military offices, chief of army staff (COAS) and chairman joint chiefs of staff committee (CJCSC).

How case unfolded

Former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Faiz Hameed was arrested by Pakistan military in connection to a housing scheme scandal and the process for his court martial was initiated, the army said on Monday.It is for the first time in the country's history that court martial has been initiated against a former intelligence chief, according to Dawn .“Complying with the orders of Supreme Court of Pakistan, a detailed court of inquiry, was undertaken by Pakistan Army, to ascertain correctness of complaints in Top City case made against Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd),” a press statement by Pakistan army said further adding that ""the process of Field General Court Martial has been initiated and Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd) has been taken into military custody.”“Consequently, appropriate disciplinary action has been initiated against Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), under provisions of Pakistan Army Act,” the release further said.Hameed was regarded as close aide to Imran Khan, who appointed him to lead the ISI during his tenure as prime minister. Khan was removed from office in 2022 through a vote of no-confidence, which he claims was orchestrated by the military, though the military denies this allegation.In 2022, Hameed was one of the six senior-most generals whose names were forwarded by general headquarters to Pakistani prime minister Shehbaz Sharif for consideration for the two top military positions. He, however, chose to seek early retirement and submitted his resignation to the high command, as per sources.The Supreme Court, in its order dated November 14 last year, had said that the allegations against Hameed were of ""extremely serious nature"" and ""would undermine the reputation of the federal government, the armed forces, ISI and Pakistan Rangers, therefore, they cannot be left unattended.”This came after the management of Top City, a private housing scheme, made allegations against the former spy-master, accusing him of orchestrating a raid on the offices and residence of its owner, Moeez Khan.The petition was filed on May 12, 2017, and it said that Pakistan Rangers and ISI officials conducted a raid on Top City's office and Moeez’s residence, seizing valuables such as gold and diamond jewelry and money in connection with an alleged terrorism case, Dawn reported.It also alleged the involvement of former ISI officials Irtaza Haroon, Sardar Najaf, Wasim Tabish, Zahid Mehmood Malik, and Mohammad Munir ""in the illegal takeover of the housing society”.In March, a court placed retired naib tehsildar Najaf Hameed, Hameed's brother, under a 14-day judicial remand.Najaf and other co-accused had sought pre-arrest bail in an FIR filed with the Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) in Rawalpindi.The FIR alleged that former minister for mineral resources Hafiz Ammar Yasir had acquired properties worth billions of rupees through intermediaries.In April, the military had reportedly established an inquiry committee to investigate allegations of authority misuse involving the former ISI head.","Former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Faiz Hameed was arrested by Pakistan military in connection to a housing scheme scandal.
