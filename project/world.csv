INDORE: New CCTV footage that surfaced on Saturday in Raja Raghuvanshi murder case shows prime accused Raj Kushwaha holding a white shroud and a floral garland while standing outside the victim's residence on the day of his funeral.The footage, captured on June 4 when Raja's body was brought to his Indore home, shows Raj not only participating in the rituals but also consoling Sonam Raghuwanshi's father, Devi Singh. Raj is seen placing his hand on Devi Singh's shoulder and remaining close to him throughout the mourning.While pictures of Raj consoling Sonam's father had gone viral on social media earlier, this footage has raised suspicion as it shows him making repeated phone calls during the funeral. Investigators suspect he may have been relaying real-time updates from the house, possibly to Sonam.Officials are now trying to determine whom Raj was communicating with during the funeral and whether the calls were connected to a larger conspiracy behind Raja's murder. ""He was so confident and had the audacity to place a shroud on the coffin of my brother whose murder he conspired. He kept talking to someone on phone during the mourning.We realised this later when we checked the CCTVs. Probably he was talking to Sonam,"" said Vipin Raghuwanshi, Raja's brother.Both Sonam and Raj Kushwaha were produced in court on Saturday and have been sent to judicial custody for 13 days. Three other co-accused are already in jail.A Shillong police team, which is stationed in Indore since Tuesday, continues to question individuals linked to the case. They have interviewed Sonam's parents, Raja's family members, Sonam's co-workers at her brother Govind's factory, and the drivers who took her to Uttar Pradesh.","CCTV footage shows prime accused Raj Kushwaha holding a white shroud and a floral garland while standing outside the victim's residence on the day of his funeral.

Stricter local vigilance and community monitoring Stronger national intelligence and enforcement systems

NEW DELHI: The two Kashmiris arrested by National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Sunday not only harboured the three Pahalgam attackers for two days in their 'dhok' (hut) in Hill Area, located around 2 km from Baisaran, before the latter headed out to massacre 26 civilians but also tipped them off on the deployment of security personnel in and around the attack site ""in return for a few thousand rupees"".Sources aware of NIA probe told TOI that three Pakistani terrorists affiliated to Lashkar were sheltered by accused Parvaiz Ahmad Jothar and Bashir Ahmad Jothar in the seasonal 'dhok' on April 20 and 21, immediately preceding the fateful day. NIA had said on Sunday the accused ""knowingly provided the Pakistani terrorists food, shelter & other logistical support"".On Monday, Parvaiz and Bashir were produced before the NIA court in Jammu, which remanded them to NIA custody for five days.

Since they were also operating pony rides in the area, they were fully aware of the police/security pickets at the attack site, the gap between consecutive area domination exercises and the pattern of deployment of troops at the site. Despite being aware of the terrorists' intentions, they willingly shared these details, making themselves active participants in the Pahalgam terror attack conspiracy,"" a source said.When confronted by NIA, Parvaiz and Bashir claimed that though they knew of plans to unleash a terror strike, they had no idea that tourists in Baisaran were the target.

"In UP village, forgotten Indian roots of Ayatollah Khomeini",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-up-village-forgotten-indian-roots-of-ayatollah-khomeini/articleshow/122010671.cms,"KINTOOR (BARABANKI): In Kintoor, a tranquil village of 13,000 nestled along the Ghaghara, 70 kilometres from Lucknow, only five Shia families remain. Among them, the Kazmis claim a distant kinship with Syed Ahmad Musavi Hindi, grandfather of Ayatollah Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini, the fiery cleric who ignited Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution and became its first Supreme Leader.Born in Kintoor in the early 19th century, Ahmad’s journey from this unassuming village wove a legacy that reshaped West Asia’s history. He left India, escaping colonial rule in 1830, migrating to Najaf, and then finally settling in Khomeyn in 1834. Hence the family name.A portrait of Ruhollah Khomeini still hanging in his drawing room, septuagenarian Syed Nihal Kazmi says, “My great-great-great-grandfather Mufti Mohammad Quli Musavi and Syed Ahmad Musavi were cousins. Ahmad’s story began here in Kintoor, but he became Iran’s forever.” The village, once a vibrant hub of Shia scholarship in the kingdom of Oudh, is concerned with the war in West Asia.BBC journalist and author Baqer Moin, in his book Khomeini: Life of the Ayatollah, writes that Syed Ahmad Musavi Hindi left Kintoor around 1830, drawn to Najaf, Iraq, for pilgrimage. There, he befriended Yusef Khan Kamarchi, a landowner from Farahan, near Khomeyn, Iran.Persuaded by Yusef, Ahmad settled in Iran in 1839, purchasing a sprawling house and garden in Khomeyn that remained in the family for over a century.Ahmad went to become a Twelver Shia cleric. From his third wife, Sakineh Ahmad, who was his friend Yusef’s sister, Ahmad had three daughters and a son, Syed Mostafa, father of Ruhollah Khomeini. Ahmad died in 1869 and was buried in Karbala.The Musavi family’s roots trace back to Nishapur (or Neyshabur), Iran, over 2,500 kilometres from Kintoor. “In the early 18th century (1700), they migrated to India, settling in Kintoor,” Moin notes. The family, Musavi Syeds, claimed descent from the Prophet through his daughter and the seventh Shia Imam, Musa al-Kazim, a lineage rooted in Nishapur.Syed Adil Kazmi, Nihal’s youngest son and an LLB graduate, says, “Our ancestors’ journey from Nishapur to Kintoor, and Ahmad’s return to Iran, tied two worlds together.”Today, Iran’s defiance under Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei echoes Khomeini’s unyielding spirit. “Long before Khamenei or the 1979 revolution led by Khomeini, it was Ahmad, born in our Kintoor, whose choice to settle in Iran changed West Asia’s discourse,” Adil says.From Ahmad’s departure to Khomeini’s revolution, Kintoor’s quiet lanes hold stories of faith, migration, and a family that bridged continents, leaving an indelible mark on history.Kintoor’s legacy also includes Justice Syed Karamat Husain, a Musavi Syed who rose to the position of a judge at the Allahabad high court and founded the Karamat Husain Muslim Girls’ PG College in Lucknow, championing education for women.","The Kazmis claim a distant kinship with Syed Ahmad Musavi Hindi, grandfather of Ayatollah Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini.

Army troops opened fire after detecting suspicious movement in a forward area near the Line of Control (LoC) in Rajouri district on Tuesday, as security forces launched extensive search operations across more than a dozen locations in Poonch, Samba, and Kathua districts of Jammu and Kashmir, PTI reported citing officials.The troops spotted the movement of three to four individuals using thick forest cover in the Chingus area of the Kiri sector, prompting them to fire more than two dozen rounds and conduct a search operation, deploying drones to scan the area.However, despite the efforts, the officials said that no trace was found of the suspected people.They further added that based on the information of the suspicious movement, joint teams of the special operations group, CRPF, and Rashtriya Rifles began searches in over a dozen areas of Poonch district, including Surankote and Mendhar, from around 6 am.The operation was conducted across locations like Sari, Pathankhor, Chandimarh and Kallar-Gursai, though no arrests were reported.In Kathua and Samba districts, police assisted by paramilitary forces searched villages close to the international border, including Bein Nullah, Chak Dhulma, and Chakra.Meanwhile, with the Amarnath Yatra set to begin on July 3, senior superintendent of police, Udhampur, Amod Nagpure, chaired a detailed briefing for officers assigned to the pilgrimage route.A police spokesperson informed that the session focused on strengthening security at vulnerable points, particularly along the Jammu-Srinagar National Highway, along with ensuring smooth traffic management and preparing contingency plans for any emergency situations.He added that officers were directed to extend timely support to pilgrims and maintain close coordination with disaster management teams.The SSP also highlighted the importance of community engagement, real-time surveillance, and prompt reporting of any suspicious activity to ensure a safe and smooth pilgrimage.","Troops spotted the movement of three to four individuals using thick forest cover in the Chingus area of the Kiri sector, prompting them to fire more than two dozen rounds and conduct a search operation.

2 Air India Flights Cancelled, One Mumbai-Bound Plane Grounded In Kolkata Over Engine Snag

NEW DELHI: Air India said on Tuesday that airlines would ""progressively resume flights"" to West Asia as airspace gradually reopens in parts of the conflict-hit region.The airlines, however, said that most operations to and from the Middle East will resume from June 25.""Flights to and from Europe, previously cancelled, are also being progressively reinstated from today, while services to and from the East Coast of the US and Canada will resume at the earliest opportunity. Some flights may experience delays or cancellations due to consequential impacts and extended re-routings/flight times, but we are committed to minimising disruptions and restoring our schedule integrity. Air India will continue to avoid airspaces assessed as unsafe at any given time,"" the Air India Spokesperson said.The decision to resume operations comes hours after Israel and Iran accepted a ceasefire plan proposed by US President Donald Trump to end their 12-day war that has roiled the West Asia. The agreement followed Tehran’s retaliatory limited missile attack on a US military base in Qatar.Both sides accepted the deal after Tehran launched a final onslaught of missiles targeting Israel, killing at least five people early Tuesday morning.In response, Israel carried out a blitz of airstrikes on sites across Iran before dawn.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had agreed to a bilateral ceasefire with Iran in coordination with Trump.Netanyahu told Israel’s security cabinet on Monday night that Israel had achieved all of its war goals in the 12-day operation against Iran. These, he said, included ""removing the threat of Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.""He added that Israel also damaged Iran’s military leadership, struck several government sites, and ""achieved control over Tehran’s skies.""The Israeli PM, however, warned that Israel would respond ""forcefully to any violation of the ceasefire”.",Most operations to and from the Middle East will resume from June 25.

India-born B-2 engineer's espionage revisited as US targets Iran with stealth bomber,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-born-b-2-engineers-espionage-revisited-as-us-targets-iran-with-stealth-bomber/articleshow/122060148.cms,"A brilliant Bombay-born engineer helped build America's deadliest ghost in the sky. Then he betrayed it. Sold its secrets to China. Decades later, the same B-2 stealth bombers he helped perfect unleashed bunker busters on Iran's nuclear facilities on June 22.Noshir Sheriarji Gowadia, now 81, sits behind bars in Colorado's Florence, serving a 32-year sentence handed down on Jan 24, 2011. The former Northrop engineer helped design B-2 stealth bomber's propulsion system, held top-level security clearance, and taught classified aeronautics. He was convicted of espionage after passing classified information to Beijing.Born April 11, 1944, to a Parsi family, Gowadia reportedly earned the equivalent of a PhD by 15. At 19, he left for US to study aeronautical engineering and became a naturalised American on July 25, 1969. A year later, he joined Northrop, where he was instrumental in developing the B-2 Spirit's infrared-shielded propulsion system.""The entire geometry came from me,"" Gowadia said. His internal codename: ""Blueberry Milkshake"". Northrop secured the B-2 contract in 1981, the bomber's defining breakthrough being its radar-elusive profile.Gowadia's work reduced visual, infrared, and radar signatures - vital to B-2's stealth edge.He left Northrop to start his own defence consultancy in Albuquerque. He advised on CIA aircraft and nuclear weapons at Los Alamos, and in 1999, launched NS Gowadia Inc. But mounting expenses drove him to look abroad for clients - a search that ended in China. Gowadia made three trips to China, providing details on stealth propulsion. Beijing used the information to build an undetectable exhaust system for cruise missiles. His payment: $110,000. Years later, satellites picked up what looked like a B-2 clone drone at a Chinese air base.On Oct 13, 2005, FBI agents knocked on Gowadia's Hawaii home. Seeing handcuffs, Gowadia muttered: ""No."" The agent tucked them away. On Oct 26, he was arrested and charged with one count of sharing national defence secrets with a foreign nation. On Oct 22, 2005, he wrote his final confession: ""On reflection what I did was wrong to help the PRC make a cruise missile. What I did was espionage and treason because I shared military secrets with the PRC. ""Gowadia was convicted on 14 counts under Espionage Act and Arms Export Control Act. His son Ashton said the jury was barred from seeing exonerating documents and vowed to appeal. Now, the engineer's betrayal resurfaces in the shadow of bombs falling over Iran.

James Harden Named in Assault Lawsuit After Nephew’s Alleged Crime at Houston Party,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/why-is-james-harden-being-dragged-into-his-nephews-alleged-sxual-assault-case-la-clippers-stars-reported-negligence-explained/articleshow/122050420.cms,"James Harden.

What is James Harden accused of and why?



Watley and two friends, referred to as Jane and Emily, arrived at Harden’s party after being invited to the “studio” area of his Houston mansion.

Justice Armani Blackburn, Harden’s nephew, offered them drinks from a bottle, after which they all lost consciousness.

Watley claims her memory became “extremely hazy,” but she recalls Blackburn urging her to go somewhere with him.

She later remembers being “shocked into consciousness” during the assault, describing herself as being “in a dream-like state” and “not fully awake.”

In a troubling civil lawsuit filed in Harris County, Texas, Los Angeles Clippers guard James Harden finds himself under legal and public scrutiny, not for his direct involvement in a crime, but for what the plaintiff calls his ""negligence"". The case stems from a New Year’s Eve party hosted at Harden’s Houston mansion in December 2024, where a woman, Marisa Watley, alleges she was r*ped by Harden’s nephew, Justice Armani Blackburn, while unconscious. Harden is now being sued for allegedly failing to prevent the incident by his personal security team.The complaint, filed by Marisa Watley and first obtained by The Athletic, outlines serious allegations of s*xual assault against Blackburn and claims of negligence on James Harden’s part for what occurred under his roof. While the lawsuit does not accuse Harden of assault, it states that he is “vicariously liable for the actions of his guards and their corporate employer”, both of whom are also named defendants.Watley alleges the following series of events unfolded at the party—The lawsuit further alleges that Harden’s in-home security staff removed Watley’s two friends from the residence, even as they pleaded that Watley was still inside.Her sister, Elaina, was contacted by the friends, and she, in turn, reached out to Harden’s sister, the mother of Blackburn.Elaina submitted a photo of Watley to Harden’s security team. According to the complaint, they falsely claimed that the woman inside with Blackburn was not Watley.Watley’s legal team said Harden’s security staff could have prevented the r*pe had they acted appropriately. “Since New Year’s Day, when I reported the r*pe by Mr. Blackburn to the police, I have remained puzzled by how Mr. Harden’s security behaved that day—it is painful to imagine that this all could have been stopped in time,” Watley said in a statement released through her attorneys. “I hope this complaint pushes security employees generally to act more responsibly when women are in danger. ”Also Read: James Harden stuns fans by dressing as WWE legend Hulk Hogan at Fanatics Fest showdown The lawsuit seeks a jury trial and demands economic, compensatory, and punitive damages. Watley’s attorneys, Michael J. Willemin, John S. Crain, Jay Ellwanger, and Kaylyn Betts, shared the gravity of the situation: “Ms. Watley has shown great strength and courage in coming forward to hold Mr. Blackburn and Mr. Harden accountable for what happened to her on New Year’s Day 2025 in Mr. Harden’s mansion. This r*pe was immediately reported to the police, and we will bring Mr. Blackburn and Mr. Harden to justice through the civil justice system.”Harden or his representatives have not commented on the alleged lawsuit as of yet.","Los Angeles Clippers guard James Harden is being sued for what the plaintiff calls his ""negligence"" The case stems from a New Year's Eve party hosted at Harden’s Houston mansion in December 2024, where a woman, Marisa Watley, alleges she was r*ped.

Keeta Vaccaro wows online followers amid break-up with Miami Dolphins' Tyreek Hill



Who is Keeta Vaccaro beyond the headlines?



Keeta Vaccaro, the estranged wife of wide receiver for the Miami Dolphins, Tyreek Hill, was in the news this week for her gorgeous new look. Embracing natural curls and a see-through brown gown, Keeta Vaccaro posted her ‘curls all summer’ style on Instagram, making heads turn as she owned the new chapter in her life with style and poise.The Instagram post, simply captioned ""Curls all summer,"" got people talking as Keeta Vaccaro looked elegant and confident during an ongoing divorce from NFL superstar Tyreek Hill.The two had only recently married, in November 2023, during the bye week of the Miami Dolphins. Even when Tyreek Hill openly debunked the initial divorce rumors—writing that the two were ""happily married"" in a now-deleted tweet—court documents later confirmed that the split was indeed occurring.Tyreek Hill and Keeta Vaccaro's relationship had previously been filled with public displays of affection, milestone celebrations, and even shared social media collaborations.

'Flat-out wrong': White House denies report

A fragile ceasefire





Early US intelligence assessments have cast doubt on President Donald Trump’s assertion that recent American air strikes had ""completely and totally obliterated"" Iran’s nuclear programme. According to a classified report by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), Iran's key enrichment capabilities at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan were damaged, but not destroyed, and could be restored within months.The findings, first reported by CNN and described by multiple officials familiar with the assessment, indicate that while the strikes caused “significant damage”, Iran's centrifuges remain largely intact and much of its highly enriched uranium stockpile was likely moved ahead of the attacks.Also read: What if US bombing on Iran's nuclear sites was effective - and that’s the problem? These findings contradict President Donald Trump who hailed the mission as having “completely and totally obliterated” Iran’s enrichment facilities in a televised message following the strikes.However, the DIA report concludes otherwise, suggesting the impact was far more limited and temporary. Intelligence gathered in the days following the strikes revealed that fortified underground facilities at Fordo, for instance, were not penetrated despite the deployment of 30,000-pound bunker-buster bombs.The tunnel entrances collapsed, but the subterranean centrifuge halls were not destroyed.Trump reacts to this report in strong words, calling it an ""ATTEMPT TO DEMEAN ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL MILITARY STRIKES IN HISTORY. THE NUCLEAR SITES IN IRAN ARE COMPLETELY DESTROYED!""Also read: 'Fake news': Trump doubles down on 'Iran nuclear sites obliterated' claim after US intel contradicts him; defends Op Midnight Hammer The White House dismissed the assessment as “flat-out wrong”. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the leaks were intended to “discredit the brave fighter pilots” and undermine Trump’s leadership. “Everyone knows what happens when you drop fourteen 30,000-pound bombs perfectly on their targets: total obliteration,” she said.Despite these claims, intelligence sources revealed that Iran likely anticipated the strikes. Satellite imagery from Maxar Technologies, dated June 19 three days before the US assault showed bulldozers and trucks near Fordo, sealing tunnel entrances with dirt. Experts believe Iran may have used these vehicles to move enriched uranium and possibly centrifuges out of the strike zones.Eric Brewer, a former US intelligence analyst, said, “It is plausible that Iran moved the material enriched to 60% out of Fordo and loaded it on a truck.” Kelsey Davenport from the Arms Control Association added that Iran could now operate a covert facility to resume enrichment, though such a move would carry significant risks.Also read: Mystery deepens over Uranium stockpile; was it buried or moved? Vice President JD Vance, defending the operation, argued that depriving Iran of the ability to enrich to weapons-grade uranium was a sufficient military objective. “That is mission success,” he said, even if Iran retains stockpiles of 60% enriched material.While Iran maintains that its nuclear programme is peaceful, prior to the strikes, it was believed to possess over 400 kilograms of 60% enriched uranium enough, if further enriched, to build several bombs. Iran recently confirmed it has built a third enrichment facility in Isfahan, the status of which remains unclear following joint Israeli and US bombardments.The ceasefire brokered by the US is currently holding, despite accusations from Israel that Iran violated the truce by firing missiles — a claim Tehran denies. Trump, expressing frustration, blamed both sides for escalating tensions, saying they had “fought so long and so hard they don’t know what they’re doing.”Also read: Ceasefire imposed, ceasefire violated but 'war stopped'? : How Iran and Israel disappointed Trump- key developments Trump reportedly told Netanyahu in a post-strike phone call that no further American military operations would follow, urging diplomatic resolution instead.

As the dust settles, the debate over the strike’s true effectiveness and the future of Iran’s nuclear ambitions continues.","US intel: Iran's key enrichment capabilities at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan were damaged, but not destroyed.

UFC legend Jon Jones just made headlines again, but not for a fight. A surprise announcement about his retirement came out on Saturday, but that’s not all. Court documents now show that the former champion is facing a criminal charge from an incident that happened months ago. The details are shocking and involve a crash, a mysterious phone call, and strange behavior after the accident.Charged with a misdemeanor in New Mexico for allegedly leaving the scene of an accident, former UFC heavyweight champion Jon Jones is now accused.

Though she said she had no waist-down apparel and police said Jon Jones had been driving, she escaped the site right after the collision.The woman also told police later that she had been drinking alcohol and using mushrooms while at Jones’s house. She said she remembered changing clothes at his place and then somehow ending up in the crashed car.She claimed she didn’t know how she got there.A police aide at the scene spoke to a man believed to be Jon Jones when the woman called him from the car. That guy sounded drunk and declined to state his name. The complaint further charges that he stated he would use force and violence.The police said that Jon Jones was interviewed days later. He called her after the accident and admitted she had left his residence after drinking. He also said he was scared when he picked up the phone and someone else started shouting and swearing.Court records indicate the crash occurred on February 21; the accusation was officially recorded on February 24; the complaint was at last filed in mid-June 2025.Just before this criminal charge became public, Jon Jones announced his retirement from UFC on Saturday, June 22, 2025.

Chinese historian Jiang Xueqin's 2024 lecture goes viral for predicting Trump's return and Iran war,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/chinese-historian-jiang-xueqins-2024-lecture-goes-viral-for-predicting-trumps-return-and-iran-war/articleshow/122055168.cms,"Chinese professor Jiang Xueqin predicted in 2024 that Trump would go into war with Iran after coming back to power.

Who is Jiang Xueqin?







Chinese historian Jiang Xueqin's 2024 lecture is going viral as he predicted that Donald Trump would return as US president and there would be war with Iran. The lecture was part of his ""predictive History"" series in which he explained how a new Trump administration would be pushed toward war with Iran because of political pressure from the Israel lobby, Saudi Arabian interests and America's reliance on global hegemony for financial gains.When the Beijing-based professor gave this lecture, Joe Biden was still the president. The lecture went unnoticed but now social media users are sharing clips from that lecture.Jiang outlined a scenario he called ""Operation Iranian Freedom""—a joint invasion by the US, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and allies, including the UK and UAE. He suggested Trump would justify the war by pointing to Iran's nuclear program, proxy attacks, threats to allies, and a call to spread democracy.Jiang, however, gave a more intensive prediction that US troops would be deployed into Iran and would be held hostage. Conquering Iran would require at least 3 to 4 million soldiers, far beyond US military capacity.Jiang continued offering his explanations after Donald Trump ordered Operation Midnight Hammer, in which the US destroyed three nuclear sites. Jiang explained the scenario through his game theory.But now with Donald Trump announcing a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, social media users observed that the historian went too far in his prediction, as US is not engaging in any war with Iran.Jiang Xueqin is a Beijing-based educator, writer, and advocate for education reform, known for his work in promoting creativity, critical thinking, and global citizenship in Chinese schools. A Canadian citizen of Chinese descent, he graduated with distinction in English literature from Yale College in 1999. Jiang contributes to Chinese and global media, including columns for the New York Times Chinese website and China Youth Daily, with articles in the Wall Street Journal, Chronicle of Higher Education, and others.

‘Naked political provocation’: China slams US over spy recruitment videos; mocks CIA’s drive as ‘absurd’ and ‘amateurish’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/naked-political-provocation-china-slams-us-over-spy-recruitment-videos-mocks-cias-drive-as-absurd-and-amateurish/articleshow/122060277.cms,"This is an AI-generated image, used for representational purposes only.





Beijing has sharply criticised the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for what it called an ""absurd"" and ""clumsy"" attempt to recruit Chinese citizens through social media videos.In a statement posted Wednesday on its official WeChat account, China’s ministry of state security (MSS) called the CIA’s efforts an “amateurish gambit” and accused the US of “paranoid delusions.”“These two painstakingly crafted ‘job ads’, riddled with clumsy rhetoric and slanderous claims, lay bare the absurd logic and paranoid delusions of American intelligence agencies,” said the MSS, as cited by news agency AFP.“Once again, the self-proclaimed 'world’s top intelligence power' has turned itself into an international laughingstock through its baffling incompetence.”The CIA videos, posted last month on platforms including YouTube and X, featured fictional narratives of Chinese officials secretly contacting the CIA over concerns about corruption and lack of progress within the Communist Party.The clips also included contact information on the dark web and encouraged potential informants to take control of their own fates.“Heaven helps those who help themselves,” one of the CIA videos stated, showing a senior Chinese official expressing fear for his family’s future before reaching out to the CIA.CIA Director John Ratcliffe had confirmed to Fox News that the videos were aimed at “recruiting Chinese officials to help the US” by sharing classified information. “One of the ways we do that is by recruiting assets that can help us steal secrets,” he said.The MSS condemned the initiative as a “naked political provocation” and warned that “any attempt to incite betrayal among the Chinese people is doomed to fail, and any plot to infiltrate China for intelligence will prove futile,” according to AFP.The campaign sparked mockery on Chinese social media. On Weibo, users joked about the videos, with one commenter asking, “Can we organise a group of scammers to carry out a telecom fraud against the CIA?”The US and China have a long history of accusing each other of espionage. Earlier this year, China claimed to have implicated three US “secret agents” in cyberattacks during February’s Asian Winter Games.The MSS also said in March it sentenced a former Chinese engineer to death for allegedly leaking state secrets to a foreign country.The CIA’s latest effort to boost human intelligence follows its broader push to recruit sources in adversarial nations such as Iran and North Korea. The agency had previously launched a similar online campaign targeting Russia.","US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) launched social media campaign to recruit Chinese citizens.

Both Israel and Iran deny violating truce,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/both-israel-and-iran-deny-violating-truce/articleshow/122060296.cms,"



After US President Donald Trump harshly criticised Israel and Iran on Tuesday for mounting attacks after his announcement that a ceasefire deal had been reached, both countries denied having violated the truce and pushed back with their own timelines of events.The absence of details surrounding the truce deal added to the confusion about the sequence of the strikes and counter-strikes that took place in the hours after the initial announcement. Trump did not publicly specify a start time when he announced the truce, for example. There are also time differences involved. Iranian time is half an hour ahead of Israeli time, which is seven hours ahead of Eastern Daylight Time.Yet despite the discordant Iranian and Israeli claims about timelines, the mutual denials of violations strongly suggested that each side wanted the ceasefire to hold.PM Netanyahu of Israel said Tuesday afternoon that the ceasefire had been set to take effect at 7am Israel time. Four hours earlier, at 3am, Israel attacked targets ""in the heart of Tehran,"" his office said in a statement, adding that shortly before the truce came into effect Iran fired a barrage of missiles at Israel.One hit an apartment building in the southern Israeli city of Beersheba, killing four people. At 7.06am in Israel, Iran fired another missile, and then two more at 10.25am, according to Israel. Netanyahu's office said those missiles were intercepted or fell in open areas. In response, Netanyahu's office said, Israeli forces destroyed a radar position near Tehran.By then, Trump had publicly demanded that Israel not respond, describing the last volley of missiles fired by Iran at northern Israel as ""one rocket that didn't land, that was shot perhaps by mistake.""Despite earlier threats from the Israeli defence minister and military that Israel would respond forcefully to the missile fire, the actual Israeli response appeared to be limited and symbolic. ""Following a conversation between President Trump and PM Netanyahu, Israel refrained from further attacks,"" Netanyahu's office said.Around the same time, Trump wrote on social media that Israel's warplanes would ""turn around and head home.""Iran, for its part, said its missile fire came as retaliation for Israel's pre-dawn bombardment, and only before the cease-fire was meant to start.The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps said that in retaliation for ""savage"" Israeli attacks on Iran overnight, Iran had launched 14 missiles at military and logistical centres in Israel in the ""final minutes"" before the cease-fire came into effect, according to a statement published on the Telegram channel of Press TV, an Iranian state news channel. The statement made no mention of the firing any missiles after the cease-fire came into force, as Trump and Israel charged.In addition, an Iranian military spokesman, Lt. Col. Ebrahim Zolfaqari, said Israel had launched ""three waves of attacks"" against Iran on Tuesday morning, after the ceasefire was supposed to take effect, with the last ending at 9 am Iranian time, according to a Press TV report citing a report from Defa Press, another Iranian news agency.Fars, a news agency managed by the Revolutionary Guards, reported that explosions were heard in Babol and Babolsar, Iranian cities to the northeast of Tehran, without providing a time or any other details.Trump first announced that Israel and Iran had agreed to a ceasefire deal on Monday evening - around 1.30am Tuesday in Tehran - and Iran's state television later announced a ceasefire early on Tuesday morning local time. The Israeli govt remained silent until it made its own announcement of a ceasefire at about 9am.

For the second time in less than a week, a federal judge in Boston rejected efforts by the Trump administration to bar international students at Harvard University, blocking a presidential proclamation that would prevent new students from abroad from enrolling at the school.President Trump had sought to bar the students using a law designed to safeguard national security. In a strongly worded ruling on Monday, Judge Allison D Burroughs sided with Harvard lawyers who had argued that such presidential power was intended to be used against foreign enemies, not international students.The judge's order temporarily stops the proclamation from going into effect. Burroughs issued a similar decision Friday when she temporarily blocked another effort by Trump govt to keep international students out of Harvard through other means.In her ruling Monday, Burroughs said the issues at stake involved ""core constitutional rights that must be safeguarded - freedom of thought, freedom of expression and freedom of speech"" and that free speech, particularly in the academic arena, ""must be zealously defended and not taken for granted... Govt's misplaced efforts to control a reputable academic institution and squelch diverse viewpoints seemingly because they are, in some instances, opposed to this administration's own views, threaten these rights.Both orders will remain in effect until Harvard's lawsuit over the enrollment of international students is resolved.

‘I need help with you’: Donald Trump says he denied Vladimir Putin’s offer to help on Iran; redirects focus to Ukraine deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/i-need-help-with-you-donald-trump-says-he-denied-vladimir-putins-offer-to-help-on-iran-redirects-focus-to-ukraine-deal/articleshow/122059814.cms,"File photo: US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin (Picture credit: AP)





US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that Russian President Vladimir Putin had called him to offer assistance in dealing with the ongoing conflict between Iran and Israel, but he redirected the conversation to focus on the war in Ukraine.“Vladimir called me up. He said, ‘Can I help you with Iran?’ I said, ‘No, I don’t need help with Iran. I need help with you'”, Trump told journalists en route to the Nato summit.Trump added that he hoped to strike a deal with Russia soon, remarking, “Six thousand soldiers died last week,” in reference to ongoing battlefield losses in Ukraine. He did not offer further details about what such a deal might include or the status of talks.The comments came as Trump was en route to the Nato summit in The Hague, where he is set to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the sidelines. The two leaders have had a tense relationship in the past, and summit organisers have deliberately shortened the main working session to avoid any high-profile confrontations, according to news agency AFP.As per The Kyiv Independent, Russia has launched a new summer offensive in Ukraine, disregarding Kyiv’s calls for an unconditional ceasefire.Trump’s push for a peace deal comes as he continues to question the level of US financial support to Ukraine and remains sceptical of Kyiv’s war aims, reportedly believing Ukraine’s expectations are “unrealistic” given the current situation on the ground.Meanwhile, Nato allies are preparing to adopt a new defence spending pledge of 5 per cent of GDP, 3.5 per cent for core military needs and 1.5 per cent for broader security, to ensure continued US support.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen described the plan as “historic,” and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte praised Trump for “bringing everyone on board,” AFP reported.Still, Trump has stirred unease among Nato partners. During his flight to The Hague, he refused to explicitly affirm his commitment to Nato’s Article 5 mutual defence clause, saying, “Depends on your definition. There’s numerous definitions of Article Five,” a remark likely to alarm allies already wary of his unpredictable stance.He also lashed out at Spain for initially resisting the new defence spending plan, posting, “Spain threatens to derail Nato summit,” and complaining about its “very unfair” position. Spain eventually agreed after a €10 billion increase to meet Nato’s existing 2 per cent target.Trump’s overture to Putin also comes as Russia continues to deepen its military and nuclear cooperation with Iran. Moscow has relied heavily on Iranian Shahed drones in its campaign against Ukraine, while the two nations have cooperated in advancing nuclear capabilities under Western sanctions.Zelenskyy, speaking in The Hague ahead of his meeting with Trump, reaffirmed Ukraine’s position and said, “Russia must see that Ukraine will not be left alone and that Europe will not back down.”However, under pressure from the US, Nato is not expected to mention Ukraine’s membership aspirations in the summit’s final communiqué.","US President Donald Trump said Russian President Vladimir Putin called him to offer assistance in dealing with the conflict between Iran and Israel.

Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran's last shah, urged Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to step down now if he wants to get a fair trial, something that Reza said Khamenei never gave to any Iranian. Reza Pahlavi announced that he was ready to take the regime over and he was setting up a new secure platform for dissidents and internal opponents of the regime to coordinate their efforts to overthrow the disctatorrshio and put the country on the path of a ""free and democratic"" future.“We are a proud, ancient and resilient people,” Pahlavi told a press conference in Paris on Monday. “To my compatriots: This is our moment. I am with you. Let us build this new Iran together.”“I am here today to submit myself to my compatriots to lead them down this road of peace.”Pahlavi said he has spoken with people across Iran and realized that this is Iran's Berlin Wall moment. ""But like all moments of great change, it comes fraught with danger. We stand at a crossroads. One road leads to bloodshed and chaos. The other—to a peaceful and democratic transition,"" he said.The destruction of the Natanz, Isfahan and Fordow has diminished the regime's domestic nuclear enrichment, he said. ""But it does not diminish the regime’s intent to acquire and use nuclear weapons. The regime, enraged and emboldened, will be seeking revenge and can acquire nuclear weapons from other rogue regimes like North Korea,"" he said.Reza Pahlavi offered his plan for transition and national renewal based on three core principles: Iran;s territorial integrity, individual liberties and equality of all citizens, and separation of religion and state.""We have already launched the Iran Prosperity Project (IPP) , a comprehensive plan for the economic reconstruction and social stabilization of our country in three phases.

Trump administration authorizes $30 million for Israeli-backed group distributing food in Gaza,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-administration-authorizes-30-million-for-israeli-backed-group-distributing-food-in-gaza/articleshow/122060051.cms,"Trump administration authorizes $30 million for Israeli-backed group distributing food in Gaza (Image: AP)





WASHINGTON: The Trump administration has authorized providing $30 million to a US- and Israeli-backed group that is distributing food in Gaza, a US official said Tuesday, an operation that has drawn criticism from other humanitarian organizations.The request is the first known US government funding for the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation's aid distribution efforts amid the Israel-Hamas war. The American-led group had applied for the money to the US Agency for International Development, which has been dismantled and will soon be absorbed into the State Department as part of the Trump administration's deep cuts of foreign aid.The application is part of a controversial development: private contracting firms led by former US intelligence officers and military veterans delivering aid to some of the world's deadliest conflict zones in operations organized with governments that are combatants in the conflicts.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive diplomatic issue involving a controversial aid program, said the decision to directly fund GHF was made ""to provide effective and accessible humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza.""The announcement comes as violence and chaos have plagued areas near the new food distribution sites since opening last month. In a statement, GHF refuted AP's reporting about any killings near its sites.The group says it has delivered some 44 million meals to Palestinians in need.Palestinian witnesses and health officials say Israeli forces have repeatedly opened fire on crowds heading toward desperately needed food, killing hundreds in recent weeks. The Israeli military says it has fired warning shots at people it said approached its forces in a suspicious manner.Witnesses said Israeli troops opened fire as crowds tried to reach a GHF site on Tuesday in southern Gaza. At least 19 were killed and 50 others wounded, according to Nasser hospital and Gaza's Health Ministry. The Israeli military did not immediately comment.Israel wants the GHF to replace a system coordinated by the United Nations and international aid groups. Along with the United States, it accuses Hamas of stealing aid, without offering evidence. The United Nations, its affiliated aid agencies and private humanitarian groups that work in Gaza have denied that there has been any significant theft of their supplies by Hamas.UN agencies, humanitarian groups and crisis experts have warned for months that many of Gaza's more than 2 million people are on the brink of famine. Israel recently eased a blockade on food and other humanitarian supplies to the territory, but the UN humanitarian aid office says deliveries into Gaza remain severely restricted, describing the current flow of food as a trickle into an area facing catastrophic levels of hunger.The Oxfam America aid organization condemned the Trump administration's funding decision Tuesday, calling the US and Israeli-supported aid operation ""a multimillion-dollar distraction from the actual causes - and solutions - of Gaza's humanitarian crisis that also carries fatal risks for its intended beneficiaries.""The Associated Press reported Saturday that the American-led group had asked the Trump administration for the initial funding so it can continue its aid operation, which has been criticized by the UN, humanitarian groups and others. They accuse the foundation of cooperating with Israel's objectives in the 21-month-old war against Hamas in a way that violates humanitarian principles.State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce told reporters earlier Tuesday that she had no information to provide on funding for the foundation.","The request is the first known US government funding for the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation's aid distribution efforts amid the Israel-Hamas war.

Zohran Mamdani, a 33-year-old Indian-origin Muslim and democratic socialist, has pulled off a stunning upset in New York City’s Democratic mayoral primary, defeating former governor Andrew Cuomo. With 95% of ballots counted, Mamdani was leading with 43% of the vote, though a final result awaits the completion of ranked-choice tabulations.Cuomo, attempting a political comeback after resigning in 2021 amid a sexual harassment scandal, conceded shortly after polls closed. “Tonight is his night. He deserved it. He won,” he told supporters, adding, “I called him, I congratulated him.”Also read: Who is Indian-origin Zohran Mamdani?

Cuomo too has left open the possibility of continuing as an independent.New York is a key Democratic stronghold, widely regarded as one of the party’s ""Big Three"" power bases, along with California and Illinois.Born in Uganda to Indian parents, Mamdani’s campaign resonated with younger voters, driven by promises of free buses, universal childcare, rent freezes, and taxing the wealthy.His grassroots strategy and social media savvy helped him gain endorsements from progressives like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.Supporters celebrated outside polling stations across Central Brooklyn, dancing and handing out iced tea in the sweltering heat. “It’s 100 degrees outside and it’s a vibe,” said Amani Kojo, a 23-year-old first-time voter. “It feels very electric seeing all the people around, the flyers, all the posts on my Instagram all day.”While Cuomo and others labelled Mamdani inexperienced and unqualified, especially for his pro-Palestinian stance, Mamdani hit back sharply. “To Mr. Cuomo, I have never had to resign in disgrace,” he said during one debate.","Zohran Mamdani, a 33-year-old Indian-origin Muslim and democratic socialist, has pulled off a stunning upset in New York City’s Democratic mayoral primary.

'Bomb Iran': Trump baits Tehran; posts parody video hours after declaring ceasefire,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/bomb-iran-trump-baits-tehran-posts-parody-video-hours-after-declaring-ceasefire/articleshow/122059726.cms,"Donald Trump and Ayatollah Khamenei (AP)

A fragile ceasefire





Just hours after announcing a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, US President Donald Trump posted a parody song titled “Bomb Iran”. The video, shared on Trump’s Truth Social account, featured footage of B-2 bombers set to the 1980 parody track by Vince Vance & the Valiants, which includes the lyric: “Ol’ Uncle Sam’s getting pretty hot, time to turn Iran into a parking lot. ”This came after, Iranian state TV released a bizarre Lego-style animation showing a cartoon Trump eating a cheeseburger while speaking with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The animation ended with the message: “We control the game.”The post came after a fragile ceasefire took effect following nearly two weeks of intense conflict between Israel and Iran. Trump had earlier claimed that US strikes had “completely destroyed” Iran’s nuclear programme. “THE NUCLEAR SITES IN IRAN ARE COMPLETELY DESTROYED!” he posted online, dismissing a classified US intelligence assessment that found the bombing campaign had only set back Tehran’s programme by a few months.The White House stood by Trump’s claims, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt calling the leaked report “flat-out wrong” and denouncing it as an effort to “discredit the brave fighter pilots who conducted a perfectly executed mission.”The conflict saw Israeli airstrikes targeting Iranian military and nuclear facilities, while Iran launched missile attacks in retaliation. At least 610 civilians were killed in Iran, according to its health ministry, while Israel reported 28 deaths. US forces joined the fray with bunker-buster bombs on key Iranian nuclear sites, which Trump declared had neutralised the threat.However, intelligence sources cited by CNN and the Associated Press said centrifuges remained functional and enriched uranium stockpiles had likely been relocated before the strikes. Despite the public statements by Trump and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth—who insisted the bombs “obliterated Iran’s ability to create nuclear weapons”—analysts believe much of Iran’s underground nuclear infrastructure survived.Trump appeared frustrated at the shaky start to the ceasefire. “We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don’t know what the f—- they’re doing,” he said. Hours later, he claimed the truce had been salvaged, telling reporters that Israeli warplanes would “turn around and head home” and that “nobody will be hurt.”","US President Donald Trump posted a parody song titled ""Bomb Iran"" The video featured footage of B-2 bombers set to the 1980 parody track by Vince Vance & the Valiants.

Karmelo Anthony, the teen who admitted to stabbing and killing Austin Metcalf, at a track meet in Texas in self defense has been indicted by a grand jury with first-degree murder. The indictment came after the local district attorney presented evidence to a grand jury asking jurors to uphold a first-degree murder charge.""For weeks, my team has been presenting evidence to the grand jury. Today, I summarized that evidence, and I asked the Grand Jury to return a first degree murder indictment against Karmelo Anthony— which they did,"" Collin County District Attorney Greg Willis said in a press release Tuesday afternoon.""With that indictment, the case now moves formally into the court system. From this point forward, we’ll continue doing our part — fully and fairly — to pursue justice under the law. The trial schedule will be set by the court. But when the time comes, we’ll be ready.""The incident shocked the country as Anthony was released on bond because of his lack of criminal history, age and community ties. nthony was released on house arrest with an ankle monitor, required to remain under adult supervision, avoid contact with Metcalf’s family, and check in with the court weekly. His defense attorneys, Mike Howard, Billy Clark, and Kim Cole, argued the $1 million bond was excessive for a first-time offender, emphasizing the need for a fair investigationAccording to an arrest-warrant affidavit and witness statements, the incident unfolded during a weather delay caused by thunderstorms and heavy rain.Both students were under a tent designated for Memorial High School’s track team, where Metcalf was a member. Anthony, a student from Centennial High School, was reportedly sitting in the Memorial team’s tent, leading to a verbal dispute. A witness stated that Metcalf told Anthony to move, to which Anthony responded by reaching into his bag and saying, “Touch me and see what happens. ” When Metcalf touched or pushed Anthony, Anthony allegedly escalated the situation by saying, “Punch me and see what happens.” According to the affidavit, Metcalf grabbed Anthony to move him, at which point Anthony pulled out a black knife and stabbed Metcalf once in the chest before fleeing the scene.Metcalf, bleeding heavily, ran down the bleachers, grabbing his chest and calling for help. His twin brother, Hunter Metcalf, attempted to save him by applying pressure to the wound, but despite efforts from athletic trainers and emergency responders, Metcalf was pronounced dead at a hospital shortly after. Surveillance footage from Kuykendall Stadium, released under strict conditions by Frisco ISD, captured the moment of the altercation but is distant and does not clearly identify individuals or the act itself. The footage shows sudden movement under the tent around 9:55 a.m., followed by people dispersing and emergency response effortsAnthony surrendered to police at the scene and was taken into custody. He admitted to the stabbing, stating, “I’m not alleged, I did it,” and claimed self-defense, saying, “He put his hands on me, I told him not to.” While in the police vehicle, Anthony was described as “crying hysterically” and asked if Metcalf would be okay and whether his actions could be considered self-defense.","Karmelo Anthony, the teen who admitted to stabbing and killing Austin Metcalf, at a track meet in Texas in self defense has been indicted by a grand jury.

On Fox News, the vice president said the location of the uranium is not the question before the US now but the question is whether Iran can make nuclear weapons from what they have.The Iranian stockpile of uranium was believed to have been located mainly at Isfahan, which houses a conversion facility that turns uranium into the form that can be fed into centrifuges for enrichment. “The goal was to bury the uranium, and I do think the uranium is buried,” Vance said.Vance dismissed the possibility that Iran moved the stockpile before the attack and said the Midnight Hammer mission was successful.","CNN quoted two people familiar with the assessment who said Iran's stockpile of uranium was not destroyed.

Former Pakistan foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari issued a blunt warning Monday to India over its unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), saying Pakistan would not hesitate to respond if its water rights were violated. Speaking during the budget session of National Assembly, the Pakistan Peoples Party chairman said, “India has two options: share water fairly, or we will take it from all six rivers. ” He described India’s move to suspend the 1960 treaty after the terrorist attack in Pahalgam as both illegal and provocative.Bilawal argued there is no clause allowing unilateral withdrawal. “India’s claim that the treaty is in abeyance has no legal basis. According to the UN Charter, cutting off water is a form of aggression,” he said. He warned that if India pursued this course, it could lead to open conflict.“We do not want war, but if water is used as a weapon... Pakistan will be forced to act — and we are in a position to defeat India just as we have before,” he said.Bilawal urged India to resume dialogue, particularly on counterterrorism coordination. “Without engagement, violence will increase in both countries,” he warned, adding Pakistan’s own fight against terrorism had been undermined by Indian attempts to “politicise the issue”.","Bilawal Bhutto Zardari says Pakistan would not hesitate to respond if its water rights were violated.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan on Monday extended its airspace ban on Indian aircraft for another month, citing ongoing tensions between the two countries following the Pahalgam terrorist attack and subsequent military operations.The ban, originally imposed on April 23, was first extended on May 23 after India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7. The Indian military action targeted and reportedly dismantled several terror camps in Pakistan-administered territory, triggering four days of intense cross-border clashes that concluded with a ceasefire on May 10.A fresh Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) issued by the Pakistan Airports Authority now extends the restriction from June 23 to July 23. The notice states, “Pakistan airspace not available for Indian registered aircraft and aircraft operated/owned or leased by Indian airlines/operators including military flights.”The situation remains tense despite the end of direct hostilities. Diplomatic channels have yet to yield any breakthroughs in repairing the fractured bilateral relationship. Indian and Pakistani officials have not resumed formal dialogue since the flare-up.The initial ban followed the Pahalgam terrorist attack, which killed at least 26 people, further deepening mistrust and heightening military alertness on both sides.","The ban, originally imposed on April 23, was first extended on May 23 after India launched Operation Sindoor.

Pakistan Condemns U.S. Strikes On Iran A Day After Nobel Peace Prize Endorsement For Donald Trump





The Pakistani government and its powerful military establishment are facing a wave of public backlash after formally recommending US President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, a move that drew widespread condemnation following the US airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities.Pakistan’s deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar sent a letter to the Nobel Committee in Norway, crediting Trump’s “decisive diplomatic intervention” during the recent India-Pakistan standoff. But the recommendation triggered a storm on social media after Trump ordered attacks on Iran’s Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan nuclear sites, an operation he called a “historic moment” and one that escalated regional tensions.On X (formerly Twitter), users accused the Pakistani government of appeasing its “master.” One user mocked, “Pakistanis, beware! After the attack on Iran, PM Shehbaz might not only award Trump the Nobel Peace Prize, but also Tamgha-e-Jurat, Tamgha-e-Shujaat, Tamgha-e-Basalat, Tamgha-e-Imtiaz, and perhaps even the Nishan-e-Haider!”Veteran journalist Ameer Abbas recalled that PML-N leader Khawaja Saad Rafique had once likened Trump to Genghis Khan and Hitler.“Now, the same government nominates him for the Nobel Peace Prize. Who is orchestrating such shameful and cowardly decisions?” he asked.Raheeq Abbasi, political analyst and columnist, noted the irony, “Trump, who vetoed the Gaza ceasefire 8 times and is protested across the West for war crimes, is being nominated for a Nobel by the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Is there no sense of honour left?”The backlash cut across ideological lines. Some users accused the military establishment of calling the shots. “The uncrowned kings are ready to sell out the nation whenever they please,” wrote Major (R) Asim.Another user, Jarjees Ahmad, called out the “supreme level of hypocrisy”, “We’re nominating someone involved in the massacre of Palestinians while claiming to stand with Iran.”Aamir Khan added, “What greater betrayal could there be to Muslims, our country, and the people of Pakistan?”The Pakistani government has yet to respond officially to the criticism.","Pakistan's deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar sent a letter to the Nobel Committee in Norway, crediting Trump’s “decisive diplomatic intervention” during the recent India-Pakistan standoff.

Poll Do you agree with Pakistan's decision to nominate Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize? Yes No





ISLAMABAD: In a move likely to stir diplomatic discussion across the region, the Shehbaz Sharif-led Pakistan govt announced on Saturday that it will formally recommend US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize, citing his diplomatic intervention during the recent India-Pakistan military crisis, reports Omer Farooq Khan.In an official statement shared on X, the Pakistan govt credited Trump's ""decisive intervention"" and ""pivotal leadership"" with helping de-escalate a rapidly intensifying standoff between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.Islamabad said it responded with a calibrated military action - Operation Bunyanum Marsoos - described as a ""measured"" and ""precise"" strike intended to restore deterrence without targeting civilian areas.Pakistan's govt claimed Trump engaged both Islamabad and New Delhi through high-level diplomacy at a moment of heightened regional volatility, securing a ceasefire that averted a wider conflagration. ""President Trump demonstrated strategic foresight and statesmanship, preventing a broader conflict that could have had catastrophic consequences for the region,"" the statement read.The govt also praised Trump for his ""sincere"" willingness to assist in resolving the Kashmir dispute - an issue Pakistan maintains is central to lasting peace in South Asia.India, however, has consistently rejected third-party involvement in Kashmir, reiterating that the issue must be resolved bilaterally under the Simla Agreement.The Pakistani statement expressed hope that Trump's ""legacy of pragmatic diplomacy"" would continue to play a role in addressing global flashpoints, including the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and rising tensions involving Iran.Trump, who is yet to respond publicly, has previously highlighted his role in managing past India-Pakistan tensions, including in 2019 following the Pulwama-Balakot incident. His earlier offer to mediate on Kashmir was firmly rebuffed by New Delhi.The Nobel Peace Prize nomination process permits formal recommendations from heads of state, national lawmakers, and certain academic and diplomatic figures. The Norwegian Nobel Committee does not comment on individual nominations.If successful, Trump would join a select group of American leaders - US Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Jimmy Carter, and Barack Obama - who have received the Nobel Peace Prize.","Pakistan to nominate US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize.

ISLAMABAD: In a bid to recalibrate Pakistan’s global narrative and bolster ties with Washington, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir concluded a series of high-level engagements in the United States, meeting senior American scholars, strategic experts, and international media representatives during an official visit to Washington DC, the Pakistani military said on Friday.In a carefully choreographed diplomatic offensive, Munir interacted with leading think tanks and policy institutions, offering what officials described as “Pakistan’s principled perspectives” on evolving regional and global dynamics. His engagements underscored Islamabad’s renewed focus on international outreach amid a shifting geopolitical landscape in South Asia.The army chief reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to regional stability, counterterrorism, and a rules-based global order, pitching the country as a responsible actor in an increasingly multipolar world.Munir spoke at length about Pakistan’s counter-terrorism strategy, highlighting military operations such as Maarka-e-Haqa and Operation Bunyanum Marsoos. He reminded his audience of Pakistan’s role as a frontline state in the global war on terror, citing the “immense sacrifices” borne by its security forces and civilians.Without naming India, Munir warned against “regional actors using terrorism as an instrument of hybrid warfare” – a familiar refrain in Pakistan’s diplomatic lexicon referring to its neighbour.While not new, the accusation resurfacing in the US capital, signalling Pakistan’s intent to shape the security discourse in South Asia.Munir also showcased Pakistan’s economic aspirations. He pitched the country’s untapped potential in IT, agriculture, and mineral wealth, calling on global stakeholders to invest in these “engines of shared prosperity”.From foreign policy to economic diplomacy, Munir portrayed Pakistan as a country pursuing dialogue, diplomacy, and international law — an image Islamabad has been keen to project as it seeks to distance itself from past reputational baggage.Discussing Pakistan-US relations, Munir called for transforming the historical security-centric engagement into a multidimensional partnership grounded in strategic convergence and mutual respect. He acknowledged past cooperation on counterterrorism and economic development but pushed for a broader framework of engagement.According to Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the army’s media affairs wing, participants appreciated the candid nature of the discussions and acknowledged Pakistan’s efforts to maintain regional stability. The meetings were seen as a trust-building exercise amid evolving US priorities in the Indo-Pacific region and growing scepticism over Islamabad’s commitments.The visit comes at a time when Pakistan is striving to reset ties with major powers, especially after its recent economic crises and shifting regional alignments. With India drawing closer to the US and Afghanistan remaining volatile, Islamabad is attempting to reposition itself as an indispensable — if complicated — regional player.","Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir concluded a series of high-level engagements in the United States.

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur on Friday issued a stern warning that he may dissolve the provincial assembly if the federal government attempts to destabilise the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI)-led coalition in the province.In a video message, Gandapur asserted that he holds the constitutional power to dissolve the assembly at any time. The warning comes amid increasing political friction between the federal and provincial governments.Gandapur suspended implementation of the recently passed provincial budget and instructed lawmakers not to submit any cut motions during Friday’s session. He added that a new strategy would be announced on Monday.“If we don’t pass the budget, the federal government could take control of the province under the pretext of a financial emergency,” Gandapur said, accusing Islamabad of conspiring to topple his government.He also lashed out at the federal authorities for what he described as “unjust treatment” of the province following the May 9, 2023, incidents. He alleged that the public mandate in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was stolen in the aftermath.“Our leader was unjustly jailed, and the way we were treated after May 9, followed by the theft of our mandate, is unacceptable.

Trump Hosts Pakistan Army Chief Munir Alone At White House, Faces Fierce Criticism From Pentagon Vet





ISLAMABAD: The meeting between US President Donald J Trump and Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, at the White House on Thursday has set the geopolitical grapevine abuzz, with whispers of backroom deals that could reshape the balance of power in South Asia and far beyond.What began as a one-hour lunch in the Cabinet Room turned into a two-hour marathon meeting that continued in the Oval Office, attended by US secretary of state Marco Rubio, special representative Steve Witkoff, and Pakistan NSA and Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Asim Malik.The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) handout flags counter-terrorism, trade, and peace, but the real stakes — against the backdrop of Iran-Israel airstrikes and India-Pakistan tensions — reveal a high-wire act with far-reaching implications.Trump, channeling his trademark deal-maker bravado, now sees Pakistan as a strategic prize. As Israel intensifies strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites and Washington edges closer to military escalation, Pakistan’s shared border with Iran becomes critical. Sources say Trump privately pressured Munir for airspace access and intelligence on Tehran — leveraging Pakistan’s backchannel role as the host of Iran’s interests section for the US.In return, he offered advanced weaponry and economic incentives, aiming to lure Islamabad away from China’s orbit and Russia’s Brics alliance.Trump’s push to expand trade in critical minerals, cryptocurrency, AI, and energy is part of a broader strategy to anchor Pakistan within US-led markets and curb China’s regional influence. He has also claimed credit for defusing the May 2025 crisis between India and Pakistan.As Pakistan’s power broker, Munir brings serious leverage. His military’s fight against Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K) syncs with US aims in Afghanistan. With ties to Iran and a shared border, Munir can offer covert intelligence or logistical support, though Pakistan’s pro-Iran rhetoric caps public alignment. Economically, he can unlock Pakistan’s mineral and tech potential for US investors, but treading too far risks Beijing’s wrath.On India, Munir’s role in brokering the May ceasefire – praised by President Trump – has been framed in Islamabad as a direct rebuttal of New Delhi’s allegations of Pakistani involvement in cross-border terrorism. With the country facing severe economic challenges, Munir is believed to have sought US military and financial assistance to modernise Pakistan’s armed forces and stabilise its economy. Trump’s openness to providing drones or missile defence systems could significantly alter the military balance with India. Munir also reportedly urged Trump to de-escalate growing tensions between Iran and Israel, warning of broader regional instability and citing Pakistan’s vocal alignment with Tehran. In a bold diplomatic gesture, Munir extended an invitation for Trump to visit Pakistan, an effort seen as central to reshaping bilateral ties and enhancing Islamabad’s global relevance.Timed amid Middle East turmoil and South Asian friction, the Trump-Munir summit is a geopolitical pivot. It signals a fragile US-Pakistan thaw, driven by Washington’s ally hunt and Pakistan’s economic crunch. For India, it’s a call to counter a US strategy cosying up to both rivals while eyeing Iran. Trump’s deal-making and Munir’s strategic charm aim to reposition Pakistan as a US cornerstone, potentially redrawing South Asia’s power map at India’s expense. Wednesday’s White House talks weren’t just diplomacy, they were a bold move in a high-stakes regional chess game.","The meeting between US President Donald J Trump and Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, at the White House on Thursday has set the geopolitical grapevine abuzz.
