AHMEDABAD: Gujarat Anti Terrorist Squad (ATS) arrested a labourer Friday for allegedly sharing sensitive information about movement of Indian Coast Guard (ICG) ships with a Pakistani agent. The accused Dipesh Gohel is a welder-cum-labourer at Okha jetty in coastal Devbhumi Dwarka district. For a daily payment of Rs 200, he allegedly passed on confidential information about ICG ships arriving at the jetty to a Pak-based woman, SP (ATS) K Siddharth said, adding Gohel was charged under BNS Sections 61 and 147 for criminal conspiracy and waging war against govt.ATS had been keeping a close watch on Gohel after receiving a tip-off that he was in touch with an agent of ISI or a Pakistan army officer. Technical surveillance mounted after the tip-off established that phone calls and messages to Gohel emanated from Pakistan, the SP said. “For past three years, Gohel was employed by a contractor who repairs ICG vessels at Okha jetty. He came in contact with a woman named Sahima on Facebook nearly seven months ago. She then started talking to him on WhatsApp,” said the SP.The woman, who told Gohel she worked for Pakistan’s navy, offered to pay him Rs 200 per day if he shared names and numbers of ICG ships and their movement, the SP said. Gohel provided the account details of three of his friends, who received Rs 42,000 in total from the woman through UPI transactions over the past seven months. Gohel would then take cash from them, said the SP.","Dipesh Gohel is a welder-cum-labourer at Okha jetty in coastal Devbhumi Dwarka district.

Sambhal mosque row

:

Supreme Court intervention: The apex court temporarily halted all proceedings related to the mosque survey at the trial court level, instructing that the matter be taken up by the Allahabad High Court within three working days. Sealed survey report: The Supreme Court directed that the advocate commissioner’s survey report remain sealed and unopened until further orders from the appellate court. Internet services restored: Internet services, suspended after the November 24 violence, were restored on Friday afternoon, marking a step towards restoring normalcy in the district. Friday prayers held peacefully: District authorities ensured that prayers at the Shahi Jama Masjid and other mosques passed off peacefully, deploying heavy police presence and installing additional CCTV cameras and drones for surveillance. Tensions since survey order: The controversy began after a civil court ordered a survey of the mosque following claims by a Hindu group that the mosque was built on the ruins of a temple. November 24 violence: On November 24, clashes between protesters and security personnel near the mosque resulted in stone pelting, arson, and the deaths of four people, with several others injured. Peace efforts by authorities: The district administration imposed prohibitory orders, and the Supreme Court instructed the state to set up a peace committee to mediate between communities. Mosque committee’s appeal: The Shahi Jama Masjid Committee challenged the survey order in the Supreme Court, citing the potential for communal unrest and calling for immediate intervention. State government’s assurance: The Additional Solicitor General, representing the Uttar Pradesh government, assured the Supreme Court of the state’s commitment to maintaining peace. SP delegation to visit Sambhal on Saturday: A delegation from the Samajwadi Party is set to visit Sambhal on Saturday, with the Congress planning a visit on December 2, to assess the situation and report back to their respective party leadership.

NEW DELHI: As Uttar Pradesh’s Sambhal reeled from violent clashes and unrest, the Supreme Court on Friday directed a trial court to halt proceedings related to the contentious survey of the Mughal-era Shahi Jama Masjid . The move comes amid tensions following a November 19 court order that authorised the survey of the mosque, based on claims that it was constructed by Mughal emperor Babur in 1526 after demolishing a temple. The apex court also instructed the Uttar Pradesh government to take measures to maintain peace and harmony in the region.The situation in Sambhal had been tense since November 24, when clashes erupted near the mosque, resulting in stone pelting and arson that led to the deaths of four people. In response, internet services were suspended and prohibitory orders were enforced. However, in a bid to restore normalcy, internet services were restored on Friday afternoon, and the day’s Friday prayers were conducted peacefully, according to officials.The Supreme Court bench, led by Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna, further directed that the survey report prepared by the court-appointed commissioner be kept sealed until the Allahabad high court or an appropriate appellate forum hears the mosque committee’s appeal. The bench also urged the formation of a peace committee comprising members from both communities to foster dialogue and prevent further unrest.","Supreme Court temporarily halted all proceedings related to the mosque survey at the trial court level.

"Corbett forest cameras spying on women, says study; probe ordered",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/corbett-forest-cameras-spying-on-women-says-study-probe-ordered/articleshow/115784378.cms,"Devices like camera traps have curtailed traditional practices, the study said

DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand’s forest department has initiated an investigation after a study by researchers from University of Cambridge claimed that “digital technologies such as camera traps and drones, deployed for tracking wild animals at Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR), are infringing on the privacy and rights of women living in villages and settlements near the forest”.The peer-reviewed research article — ‘Gendered Forests: Digital Surveillance Technologies for Conservation and Gender-environment Relationships’ — by Trishant Simlai and Chris Sandbrook, documents several incidents of privacy violations, including one in which an image of asemi-nude woman relieving herself was “inadvertently” captured by a camera trap.The woman was autistic, came from a marginalised caste group, and was unable to express her experience of being photographed to her family or other women. To make matters worse, young men, who were recently appointed as temporary forest personnel, accessed the photograph and circulated it on local social media groups. In response to this image-based abuse, residents from the woman's village destroyed camera traps in the adjacent forest areas and issued threats to set a forest personnel station ablaze,"" said the research, which was published on Nov 24.It also cited instances where women felt ""watched"" due to camera traps. ""This surveillance has discouraged women from collecting legally permitted forest resources like firewood and grass, as well as non-timber products such as herbs and honey,"" the authors of the research said.The study further said these technologies have curtailed traditional practices such as singing or engaging in loud conversations while navigating forests - behaviours that are not only culturally significant, but also serve as an essential countermeasure to deter attacks by wild animals . ""There is a 'baaghin' (tigress) with cubs in this part of our forest. If we don't sing or talk loudly, there is a chance of her being surprised and attacking us,"" a woman shared during the research conducted by Simlai, who spoke to 270 people in the settlements near Corbett over a period of 14 months in 2019. Incidentally, one woman interviewed during the research has since been killed in a tiger attack.Regarding the wider social implications , Simlai told TOI, ""The forest is a very gendered space where very complex bunch of social interactions happen between women. But camera traps, which are deployed throughout Uttarakhand, not just in CTR, are making women regulate their behaviour in terms of censoring conversations, singing less, or collecting less firewood or timber or forest produce that is around. The absence of consent in deploying these cameras is also a glaring issue that govt must address.""The study examines the dual role of surveillance technologies: while they perpetuate gender-based violence and reinforce patriarchal norms, they can also be repurposed for women's resistance, it noted. ""In one case, a woman led her abusive husband in front of a deployed camera trap with the objective to record domestic violence. She runs to the camera near her house whenever her husband gets drunk and beats her. In this way, she escapes being beaten and can also have proof if things get out of hand. Although such instances of utilising camera traps as tools of reverse surveillance or sousveillance are overshadowed by their role in propagating gendered structural violence, they warrant further investigation,"" the research highlighted.Ranjan Mishra, chief wildlife warden of Uttarakhand, said, ""The director of Corbett will investigate the matter, and we will comment only after the probe is complete.""","Uttarakhand's forest department has initiated an investigation after a study by researchers from University of Cambridge.

Experts are trying to understand if Nirvah's actions were driven by stress, confusion, or other factors.News of the cubs' birth got out on Monday. On Thursday morning, forest officials tracking Nirvah and its cubs were concerned to see it move away from the den. A monitoring team, led by veterinarians, rushed to the spot and found the decapitated carcass of one cub and another ripped to pieces.After a thorough search of the enclosure, no evidence of external interference, such as a fence breach or intrusion by other animals, was found, said an official. This led authorities to suspect that Nirvah may have been involved in the cubs' deaths.Leading cheetah expert Laurie Marker cautioned against calling it 'cannibalism'. ""New breeding females often don't know what to do with their first litter and death can occur.

BHIWANDI: Police arrested a 20-year-old sexual pervert studying hotel management for entering the terrace of a building in a high-profile society, masturbating there, and spilling his semen on the drying clothes of women.The accused did this for the last one and a half years, but the women remained silent due to shame. When these incidents increased, they raised their voices against it and informed their husbands, who later installed CCTV on the terrace of the building, after which the whole matter came to light.The arrested accused, identified as Mohammad Rayan Mohammad Nazif Siddiqui, is studying hotel management and is a resident of the Gaibi Nagar area of the city.

However, when the incidents did not stop, they informed their husbands, who then installed a gate system in the building. This prevented the accused from committing the act for two months, but despite this, he somehow managed to do it once again.

Apology email



Allegations



Conservative roots



Penelope Hegseth , the mother of Pete Hegseth , President-elect Donald Trump ’s nominee for secretary of defence , accused her son of mistreating women for years, New York Times reported.The 2018 email accusation resurfaced as questions about Hegseth’s personal conduct, especially his treatment of women, emerged during his nomination for a top administrative role, which carries significant responsibility, particularly given the military’s strict stance on adultery.In April 2018, Penelope Hegseth sent an email to her son, accusing him of years of mistreatment towards women. The email was written during a turbulent time in the family’s life, as Pete Hegseth was going through a contentious divorce from his second wife, Samantha.Penelope wrote in the email: “On behalf of all the women (and I know it’s many) you have abused in some way, I say … get some help and take an honest look at yourself.” She also expressed deep disappointment, saying, “I have no respect for any man that belittles, lies, cheats, sleeps around and uses women for his own power and ego. You are that man (and have been for years) and as your mother, it pains me and embarrasses me to say that, but it is the sad, sad truth.”She described his abusive behavior over the years as “dishonesty, sleeping around, betrayal, debasing, belittling” women.Despite her harsh words, she ended by reaffirming her love for him later in an apology email. However, the seriousness of her statement raised concerns, especially with Pete Hegseth’s nomination for Pentagon chief.In an interview with 'The New York Times' following the publication of the email, Penelope Hegseth defended her son, saying that the accusations were not true and had been written out of anger. She clarified that she had followed up immediately with an apology email, saying she had sent the original message “in anger, with emotion” during a time of personal turmoil.“It is not true. It has never been true,” she said, defending her son’s character. “I know my son. He is a good father, husband.” She also voiced her frustration with the publication of her original message, calling it “disgusting.”Her apology email to Pete, sent right after the first message, explained the emotional turmoil she was going through. “If the email damages our relationship further,” she wrote, “so be it.”In 2018, Penelope publicly praised Pete on Fox News , calling him a good son and lauding his military service on Mother’s Day. “I’m grateful for that, Pete, and proud every day to be your mom,” she said, holding hands with him on set.Questions surrounding Hegseth’s treatment of women had already begun to surface before the release of the email. Hegseth has a known history of infidelity, including divorces from his first wife, Meredith Schwarz, and his second wife, Samantha, which raised concerns about his personal conduct.His second marriage ended after he fathered a child with a co-worker, Jennifer Rauchet, who would later become his third wife. The divorce from Samantha Hegseth was bitter, with Penelope Hegseth accusing her son of trying to manipulate the situation by “labeling her as ‘unstable’ for your own advantage,” referring to Samantha. “She did not ask for or deserve any of what has come to her by your hand,” Penelope wrote, expressing her dismay at her son’s actions.Furthermore, a 2017 rape complaint against Hegseth , following an incident at a political conference in Monterey, California, has raised more concerns. Hegseth denies the claim, with his lawyers saying the encounter was consensual and he paid a settlement to protect his job at Fox & Friends.Hegseth's supporters, including vice president-elect JD Vance, are working to secure his approval. However, some Republican senators, such as senator Joni Ernst of Iowa, who has been vocal about her own experiences of military sexual harassment, have indicated that the allegations will need to be properly investigated.Hegseth has often said that he is a Christian who follows conservative family values. During his brief run for the Republican nomination for a Minnesota US Senate seat in 2012, he credited his parents for teaching him those values, saying, “I didn’t learn conservatism out of a book.”As a veteran of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, Hegseth was chosen by Trump as the nominee for defence secretary.“Had I been raised in a family where faith, fidelity and fatherhood were not valued, my choices could have led to family breakdown,” he wrote in an article for the Center of the American Experiment, a nonprofit group focused on family issues.","Penelope Hegseth sent an email to her son, accusing him of years of mistreatment towards women.

He was arrested on charges of criminal conspiracy and waging war against the govt under Sections 61 and 147 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, the SP told reporters.The ATS was keeping a close watch on Gohel after receiving a tip-off that he was in touch with an agent of Pakistan's spy agency, ISI, or an army officer.Technical surveillance mounted after the tip-off established that phone calls and messages to Gohel emanated from Pakistan, he said.""For the past three years, Gohel was employed by a contractor who repairs coast guard vessels at the Okha jetty. Gohel came in contact with a woman named Sahima on Facebook nearly seven months ago. The woman then started talking to him on WhatsApp,"" said Siddharth.The woman, who told Gohel that she works for Pakistan's navy, offered to pay him Rs 200 a day if he shared names and numbers of ICG ships arriving at the jetty and their movement, said the police officer. ""Despite knowing that it was illegal, Gohel agreed and started sharing such sensitive information,"" said the SP.Since Gohel does not have a bank account, he gave account details of three of his friends. They all received Rs 42,000 in total from the woman through UPI transactions over the past seven months. Gohel would then take cash from them, said Siddharth.","Dipesh Gohel, a welder-cum-labourer at Okha jetty in the coastal Devbhumi Dwarka district, is accused of sharing sensitive information with a Pakistan-based woman.

Did Biden's border policies cost Democrats the White House?

How did Biden's policies backfire?

Border crisis

What led to Trump’s victory?

After US President-elect Donald Trump ’s sweeping victory, Democrats spent Thanksgiving reflecting on what went wrong, with many admitting that President Biden’s handling of the border crisis alienated voters and handed Republicans control of the White House, New York Post reports.Party insiders have privately acknowledged that their failure to address concerns about illegal immigration hurt vice president Kamala Harris ’ campaign.“We destroyed ourselves on the immigration issue in ways that were entirely predictable and entirely manageable,” a Democratic senator told The Hill, acknowledging the party's role in their election loss. “We utterly mismanaged that issue, including our Democratic caucus here. That’s political malpractice,” they added.A source close to New York City mayor Eric Adams said his warnings about the effects of a porous border on cities and working-class voters were ignored. “For two years, [he] warned, and they did not listen.""One House Democrat said the party needed to simplify its message to win voter support saying, “We need to admit to the American people, ‘crime and illegal immigration are bad.’”Many Blue party members blamed Joe Biden ’s border policies for the Democrats’ defeat. These included halting the construction of Trump’s border wall, ending the “Remain in Mexico” policy, and pausing deportations.“Why would you do that? Who are you trying to play to?” another Democratic senator told The Hill, voicing confusion and frustration over Biden's policies.In January 2023, Eric Adams had warned Biden’s campaign manager, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, that working-class voters were angry about the growing number of low-skilled asylum seekers. Instead of heeding the warning, Chavez dismissed Adams, accusing him of using Republican talking points.“Now Democrats are paying the price,” an official close to Adams said.The border crisis hit a record high last December with over 302,000 crossings in a single month. Critics accused him of hiding the problem by funnelling migrants through legal entry points.Homeland Security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in January that over 85% of illegal border crossers were released into the US, up from 71% the previous October.These policies fuelled Republican attacks, leaving Democrats vulnerable on an issue that mattered deeply to voters.Trump’s campaign focused on immigration and crime. He pledged to deport criminals and proposed economic reforms like eliminating taxes on overtime pay and tips, which appealed to working-class voters.His message connected with voters in Hispanic areas of South Texas and South Florida, where he gained strong support. Exit polls showed Trump won most Hispanic male voters and grew his support among black men in key swing states.Immigration, alongside inflation and crime, ranked among voters’ top concerns, helping Trump reclaim the presidency.","Democrats privately admit their failure to address concerns about illegal immigration hurt vice president Kamala Harris’ campaign. “We utterly mismanaged that issue, including our Democratic caucus here.

A Polish bride’s dream honeymoon in Miami ended in heartbreak when she was found dead in the street just 23 days after her wedding.Aleksandra Leczycka , 26, and her husband, Dawid Leczycki, had travelled from their hometown of Siedlce, Poland, to celebrate their marriage in Florida. But their dream trip took a devastating turn.On August 29, 2022, the newlyweds were discovered unconscious on a street in Miami. Aleksandra tragically did not survive, while Dawid regained consciousness. Both were found without cash or jewellery, leading local authorities to initially suspect they had been drugged and robbed .However, a two-year re-investigation by Polish prosecutors revealed a different picture.According to the Siedlce District Prosecutor’s Office , Aleksandra’s death was likely caused by the voluntary consumption of psychoactive substances , which may have led to either an overdose or a severe allergic reaction.Prosecutor Krystyna Golabek explained, “Extensive investigative measures were carried out, including a request for legal assistance from the American side, which provided materials from their investigation. Expert opinions in the fields of computer science and toxicology were also obtained.”While the investigators did not entirely rule out the possibility that the couple had been involuntarily drugged, Golabek emphasized that none of the evidence supported the initial hypothesis of forced intoxication.In the hours before her death, Aleksandra shared joyful photos online, sipping cocktails and enjoying the Miami beaches with her husband. These images, posted just before the tragedy, now serve as poignant reminders of the couple’s brief time together after their August 6, 2022, wedding.The re-investigation, which concluded on October 23, 2024, brought clarity to the mysterious circumstances surrounding Aleksandra’s death but left lingering questions about how the psychoactive substances came into their possession.Aleksandra’s husband, Dawid, has remained silent on the events leading to her untimely passing.","Aleksandra Leczycka, 26, was found dead in Miami on August 29, 2022.

Pakistani authorities are seeking to arrest Bushra Bibi, the wife of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan , for failing to appear in court in an alleged corruption case involving 190 million pounds.Authorities attempted to arrest Bibi at her residence in Peshawar on November 23, but the attempt was unsuccessful as she was not present when the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) team and police arrived, according to a PTI report.An accountability court issued non-bailable warrants for Bibi on November 22 after she missed eight court hearings. The warrants led the NAB to dispatch a team to arrest her. Bibi currently resides in Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where Khan's political party, PTI, holds power.Both Khan and Bibi face accusations of misusing 50 billion Pakistani Rupees (190 million pounds). These funds, originally returned to Pakistan by the UK's national crime agency in a settlement with a property tycoon, were allegedly meant for the national treasury. Instead, authorities claim they were used for the personal benefit of the businessman who helped Bibi and Khan establish a university.Bibi, a trustee of the Al-Qadir Trust , is accused of benefiting from the settlement and acquiring 458 kanals of land for Al-Qadir University in Jhelum. Last month, she was granted bail after nine months in custody related to a separate case known as the Toshakhana case .","Pakistani authorities are seeking to arrest Bushra Bibi, the wife of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan.

Trump promised federal recognition for the Lumbee Tribe. Will he follow through?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-promised-federal-recognition-for-the-lumbee-tribe-will-he-follow-through/articleshow/115827343.cms,"AP file photo

OKLAHOMA CITY: When Kamala Harris and Donald Trump campaigned in North Carolina, both candidates courted a state-recognized tribe there whose 55,000 members could have helped tip the swing state.Trump in September promised that he would sign legislation to grant federal recognition to the Lumbee Tribe, a distinction that would unlock access to federal funds. He ultimately won North Carolina by more than 3 percentage points, in part due to continued support from Lumbee voters.Now, as Trump prepares to return to the White House in January, the promise will be put to the test. He has Republican allies in Congress on the issue, and now the Lumbee, as well as tribal nations across the country, are watching closely to see what comes next.Tribal nations typically receive federal recognition through an application with the Department of the Interior, but the Lumbee have been trying for many years to circumvent that process by going through Congress. Chairman John Lowery called Interior's application process ""flawed"" and overly lengthy and said it should be up to Congress to right what he calls a historic wrong.""It's just crazy that we're sitting here fighting this battle, and I have to tell you that I am real in 2024,"" Lowery said.Following the presidential election, the Lumbee hope there will be momentum behind their cause, but they face deep-rooted opposition from tribal nations across the country.There are questions about Trump's next move Several tribes, including the only one that is federally recognized in North Carolina, argue that if the Lumbee Tribe wants federal acknowledgment, it should go through the formal process in the Department of the Interior. One person familiar with Trump's thinking said the president-elect will require the Lumbee Tribe to do just that, and he won't sign a Lumbee recognition bill. The person requested anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly speak about Trump's views.Trump's spokeswoman, Karoline Leavitt, said ""no policy should be deemed official unless it comes directly from President Trump.""Federal recognition is of enormous importance, as it comes with access to resources like health care through Indian Health Services and the ability to create a land base such as reservations through the land-to-trust process. But before that happens, a tribal nation has to file a successful application with the Office of Federal Acknowledgement, a department within the Interior.The Lumbee Tribe was denied the ability to apply for federal recognition in 1987, based on the interpretation of a 1956 congressional act that acknowledged the Lumbee but stopped short of granting them federal recognition.In 2016, the Interior reversed that decision, allowing the Lumbee Tribe to apply, but the Lumbee have opted for the congressional route.The Lumbee's approach to gain recognition through legislation has stoked a simmering debate in both Indian Country and Congress about Indigenous identity and tribal nationhood.The Lumbee have received support from members of both parties Members of Congress from both parties have supported recognizing the Lumbee through legislation, including Oklahoma Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin, a member of the Cherokee Nation who campaigned for Trump in North Carolina and backed the legislation.But perhaps the state-recognized tribe's most ardent ally in Congress is North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis , who is up for reelection in 2026.Tillis introduced the Lumbee Fairness Act last year and has been a vocal supporter of the Lumbee. In interviews with The Associated Press, several tribal leaders, lobbyists, and advocates said they were told by Tillis directly or by his staff that the senator is currently and will continue to block certain bills backed by tribal nations unless the leaders of those tribes support the Lumbee.One of the bills he's promised to block, according to those interviewed by the AP, is a land transfer that would allow the Tennessee Valley Authority to return 70 acres of land to the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, the only federally recognized tribal nation in Tillis's state. It would allow the tribe to put the land in Monroe County, Tennessee into trust. The plot is part of the tribal nation's homelands and contains the birthplace of Sequoyah.""It's appalling to me. It's disgraceful,"" Principal Chief of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians Michell Hicks said. He said that Tillis told him earlier this year that he would stop any legislation dealing with the Eastern Band unless Hicks pledged his support.Hicks is among the tribal leaders who question the validity of the Lumbee's historical claims, and he said that is out of the question. At one point about a century ago, the Lumbee were known as the Cherokee Indians of Robeson County, and for many years now all three Cherokee tribes - the Eastern Band, the Cherokee Nation, and the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians - have denounced this and been vocal opponents of granting the Lumbee federal recognition.Representatives for Tillis declined to comment.Tillis held up legislation last week that would have allowed for the preservation of the site of the Wounded Knee massacre. While doing so, he singled out the heads of the Oglala Sioux Tribe and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, who have backed the preservation measure, for not supporting his efforts to federally recognize the Lumbee.""This is not about you,"" Tillis said to the two tribal nations, who he acknowledged had been trying for a century to preserve the site of the massacre. ""But you need to know that your leadership is playing a game that will ultimately force me to take a position.""Tillis suggested it was a ""casino cartel"" in part driven by the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians and an Osage attorney named Wilson Pipestem working for the tribe, that is trying to keep the Lumbee from gaining recognition, which could one day lead to the Lumbee opening their own casinos. Tillis threatened to continue publicly naming tribal leaders and their employees who he felt were standing in the way of his bill.In a statement to the AP, Pipestem said Tillis should ""apologize to the Tribal leaders for his false allegations and unscrupulous tactics.""Lowery acknowledged that Tillis has held up both pieces of legislation, but he said that Tillis has not done so at the direction of the Lumbee.""If he's put a hold on the bill it's because he reached out to tribal leaders to see where they stand on his bill, and they apparently have told him that they're not in support,"" Lowery said. ""So, he said 'well, if you can't be supportive of my bill, I can't be supportive of your bill.'""","Tribal nations typically receive federal recognition through an application with the Department of the Interior.

Joe Rogan hints at Mar-a-Lago podcast episode with Trump

Podcast host Joe Rogan has expressed openness to recording an episode of The Joe Rogan Experience from Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate, The New York Post reported.During his 13th sit-down with comedians Ari Shaffir, Mark Normand, and Shane Gillis on Thursday, Rogan discussed the possibility, saying, “Yeah, we have to. We helped Trump get elected.” The conversation came after Shaffir suggested recording an episode at Mar-a-Lago on January 14, coinciding with the release of his Netflix special, America’s Sweetheart. Rogan also revealed he had spoken with Donald Trump Jr., who said he could “make that happen.”Rogan's podcast previously hosted Trump in a nearly three-hour episode during the final stretch of the 2024 campaign. The episode drew massive traffic, amassing over 20 million views within the first 20 hours of its release.In that episode, Trump discussed his policies, his first term, and expectations for his second term. On Election Day eve, Rogan endorsed Trump and praised Elon Musk for transforming Twitter into X and backing the former president. “If it wasn’t for Musk, we’d be f**ked,” Rogan said, calling Musk’s support for Trump “the most compelling case.”While Rogan welcomed Trump and running mate JD Vance to Austin for recordings, he refused to travel to interview Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 campaign. Harris had sought an hour-long podcast session while campaigning in Texas, but Rogan insisted on hosting her in his Austin studio for a longer interview.Critics were divided over Rogan’s refusal to accommodate Harris, with some calling it a missed opportunity and others praising his consistency.Harris campaign adviser Stefanie Cutter later stated that scheduling conflicts prevented the appearance, while internal disagreements within Harris’s campaign over the podcast’s controversial reputation also played a role.Rogan’s podcast, known for its marathon episodes and uncensored format, has faced criticism in the past for hosting controversial figures and allegedly spreading misinformation. Despite this, Rogan remains a dominant media figure, with his Spotify deal reportedly valued at $200 million.","Rogan's podcast previously hosted Trump in a nearly three-hour episode during the final stretch of the 2024 campaign.

Why liberals are angry about pro-Trump Scott Jennings joining LA Times editorial board,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/liberal-pro-trump-harris-scott-jennings/articleshow/115813547.cms,"The Los Angeles Times’ decision to appoint Scott Jennings—a vocal conservative commentator and former adviser to President George W. Bush—to its editorial board has ignited a firestorm of controversy. The backlash, especially from liberal voices within the media and the Times newsroom, has been swift and intense, highlighting the deeply polarized reaction to including a prominent pro-Trump voice in the ranks of a traditionally left-leaning institution.For years, Jennings has been a lightning rod for debate, known for his blunt and often humorous critiques of the Democratic Party. His viral CNN appearances during the 2024 election cycle, where he frequently skewered President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and other Democratic figures, solidified his reputation as a fearless conservative voice. From likening Biden to Colonel Sanders with the quip, “His face is on the bucket, but he’s not making the chicken anymore,” to labeling Harris’s campaign as “the most manufactured presidential campaign ever,” Jennings has never been one to shy away from controversy.His appointment to the Times editorial board has been framed by the paper's owner, Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, as an effort to include diverse perspectives and “thoughtful voices” in shaping the paper’s opinion pages. However, for many in the newsroom and beyond, this move is seen as a betrayal of journalistic integrity. Critics argue that Jennings’ unapologetic pro-Trump stance and his critiques of the Democratic establishment amount to platforming partisanship under the guise of editorial balance.The backlash within the Times itself has reportedly been severe, with staff members expressing outrage at what they view as a sharp pivot away from the paper’s traditional values. Internal sources suggest that many journalists are “pissed off” by the appointment, feeling it undermines the institution’s credibility and its commitment to holding powerful figures accountable.Oliver Darcy, a media critic and founder of the newsletter Status, called the decision emblematic of a broader dilemma in legacy media: how to include voices that appeal to Trump supporters without compromising journalistic standards. Darcy criticized Soon-Shiong’s defense of Jennings, arguing that the media mogul seemed dismissive of concerns about factual integrity and the potential for amplifying misleading narratives.Soon-Shiong, however, has defended the appointment, emphasizing the need for robust debate and a diversity of opinions. “The new editorial board will represent all voices,” he stated, calling Jennings a “critical thinker” whose opinions are rooted in facts.Despite the internal uproar, Jennings himself has remained unapologetic. In typical fashion, he shrugged off the controversy, tweeting: “Honored to join the LA Times. Diversity of thought makes us stronger. Looking forward to adding my perspective to the conversation!”For Jennings’ supporters, this move is a long-overdue step toward ideological balance in media. They argue that the outrage over his appointment reflects an unwillingness among some on the left to tolerate dissenting views. Others see it as an essential corrective for a paper perceived by some as entrenched in liberal orthodoxy.But for critics, the controversy isn’t merely about politics—it’s about the role of facts in shaping public discourse. Many fear that Jennings’ appointment is a sign of a growing trend to normalize misinformation under the guise of editorial balance.As the fallout continues, the broader debate over how media institutions handle ideological diversity in an era of extreme polarization remains unresolved. One thing, however, is clear: Scott Jennings’ voice on the Times editorial board ensures that the paper will be at the center of America’s cultural and political debates for the foreseeable future.","The Los Angeles Times appointed conservative commentator Scott Jennings to its editorial board.

Moments later, the man was pushed from the container and was seen clinging to the container's edge before plummeting approximately 25 feet to the ground.According to a report by BBC, the incident reportedly occurred at the intersection of Jinnah and Ataturk Avenues, the epicenter of the protests. The condition of the man remains unknown.The protests were sparked by the arrest of Imran Khan , who has been in prison since August 2023 on corruption charges. Thousands of his supporters, many traveling from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, marched to Islamabad to demand his release. Among them was Khan’s wife, Bushra Bibi, who led the demonstration alongside Ali Amin Gandapur, chief minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.However, the demonstrations quickly descended into chaos. The government reported that four paramilitary rangers and two policemen were killed in clashes late Monday, with over 100 security personnel injured. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif accused protesters of resorting to violence, alleging that they rammed vehicles into paramilitary troops.The crackdown was swift and severe, with nearly 1,000 protesters arrested. Security forces employed tear gas, baton charges, and roadblocks to disperse crowds, effectively quelling the unrest. The intensity of the response led to the protest’s premature collapse, dealing a significant blow to Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party.","A protester was allegedly pushed off a stack of shipping containers by security forces during a demonstration calling for the release of former Prime Minister Imran Khan.

ISLAMABAD: A well-known Pakistani journalist, Matiullah Jan, investigating civilian deaths in a recent assault launched by security forces against supporters of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan, has been booked in terrorism and narcotics cases in Islamabad on Thursday.Jan was picked up by unknown individuals along with another journalist, Saqib Bashir, late Wednesday night. His family said he was abducted from the parking of a hospital in Islamabad at around 11pm by “unmarked abductors in an unmarked vehicle”. Bashir, who was later released, said they were collecting data from the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) on the casualties after the march when they were taken.The incident took place amid rising tensions in the capital following Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party’s claims that more than 200 of its workers had been killed by security forces during a late Tuesday night operation to disperse Imran’s supporters in the capital. The protesters had gathered to demand the release from jail of Imran Khan and other politicians and workers of his party.On Thursday afternoon, Islamabad police booked Jan with charges related to terrorism, drug-peddling and attacking police. “It is no less than a joke.

ISLAMABAD: At least eight supporters of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) were killed and dozens of others injured in Islamabad following what the party said was a sweeping crackdown overnight by security forces to disperse protesters demanding the release of jailed former prime minister and PTI chief Imran Khan Following the crackdown, Imran’s party ended its agitation but Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur addressed a press conference in his province on Wednesday saying the protest would go on. “Until Imran Khan’s call, this sit-in will go on,” he said without elaborating where it would be held. PTI has been in govt in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.Thousands of demonstrators, led by Imran’s wife Bushra Bibi, and Gandapur, had gathered in the capital on Tuesday vowing to stage a sit-in until their demands were met, including the release of political prisoners. Khan and many other PTI leaders and workers have been in jail for over a year on charges that they claim are politically motivated.Security forces launched a massive crackdown before midnight Tuesday after failing to stop protesters from marching to D-Chowk, a public square in Islamabad’s high-security red zone. In the evening authorities forced surrounding stores, cafes and markets to shut and then plunged the protest venue into darkness by switching off streetlights. Eyewitnesses said indiscriminate firing and teargas shelling, which started after 11pm and continued for about two hours, forced the PTI supporters, mostly Pashtuns from the northwest, to retreat.PTI claimed eight of its supporters had died in the late-night clashes and “hundreds” more were feared to have been killed. The govt stated three paramilitary troops and one policeman had died since the PTI launched its protest on Sunday. Islamabad’s police chief told media more than 900 people had been arrested in Tuesday’s raid, in which there were dozens of Afghan nationals.Sources at Islamabad’s two public hospitals said five civilians had died of gunshot wounds and dozens had been injured. According to PTI workers, they had picked up three bodies from the protest site.Information minister Attaullah Tarar said the protesters had fled in disarray, leaving behind vehicles, and even their shoes and clothes.PTI said in a post on social media that a “massacre has unfolded in Pakistan at the hands of security forces”. It accused the armed security forces of launching a violent assault on peaceful PTI protesters, firing live rounds with the intent to kill as many people as possible. It went on to compare last night’s clashes to the violence in the then East Pakistan in 1971. “The rulers have learned nothing from history and are prepared to destroy the country to cling to their illegitimate power,” the post stated. “With hundreds dead and countless injured, the interior minister’s threat to kill, and then the declaration of ‘victory’ over slaughtered innocents is enough evidence of the regime’s inhumanity,” it added.On Wednesday morning, the heavily fortified red zone was empty of protesters but dozens of smashed vehicles, including the charred remains of a truck from which Imran’s wife had been leading the protest, portrayed a grim picture.",At least eight supporters of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) were killed and dozens of others injured in Islamabad.

Bushra Bibi , the wife of former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan , is leading protests demanding his release from jail. At least five people have died in the resulting violence.Khan supporters, led by Bushra Bibi, marched in various locations, including D-Chowk in Islamabad. A planned rally on November 24 was prevented by an Islamabad High Court order citing the visit of Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko and a new public order law. Protests also occurred globally.Speaking to PTI workers, Bibi said, ""This is not just about my husband; it is about this country and its leader."" Addressing a rally, she added, ""Until Imran Khan is with us, we will not end this protest. I will remain here until my last breath, and I ask all of you to stand by us. This isn’t just about my husband. It’s about the future of our country and the leadership we deserve.""Khan was ousted in a no-trust motion in 2022 and has been imprisoned since.

She alleged attempts to poison her food while incarcerated. She and Khan were jailed and fined $2 million each in a corruption case related to state gifts. Khan and Bibi face approximately 200 legal cases following his removal from office.Bibi’s ex-husband, Khawar Maneka, is pursuing a case against her related to their divorce. Maneka, the son of a former minister, alleges a “fraudulent marriage.” His “fornication” claim was rejected. The case centers on whether Bibi observed the required waiting period before remarrying under Islamic law. Bibi and Maneka were married for 28 years and have five children.Bibi, approximately 50 years old, is known as a spiritual guide and faith healer. Khan has described her as a spiritual guide. Prior to marrying Khan, Bibi was married to Maneka and was known as Bushra Maneka. She is a follower of Sufism and a devotee of the Sufi mystic poet Baba Farid.Khan stated in 2018 that he did not see Bibi’s face until after their marriage. “In a rare, and till then the only TV interview in October 2018, she dismissed this as bunkum,” regarrumors that she had foreseen Khan’s prime ministership in a dream.","Imran Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi, is leading protests demanding his release from jail.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan deployed its army within the nation's capital on Tuesday with orders to shoot protesters if necessary, as deadly clashes escalated between the police and supporters of former PM Imran Khan.The govt said four paramilitary rangers and two policemen were killed late Monday and over 100 security personnel injured in the violence, as thousands of protesters marched to Islamabad to demand Khan's release from prison. PM Shehbaz Sharif blamed the protesters for the soldiers' deaths, accusing them of ramming the paramilitary troops with a convoy of vehicles. ""It is not a peaceful protest. It is extremism,"" he said in a statement, aimed at achieving ""evil political designs"".Zulfikar Bukhari, spokesman for Khan's party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), denied Sharif's accusation and claimed that two protesters had been killed and 30 more injured in the clashes, the worst political violence seen in months in the nation of 241 million people. One of the protesters was shot dead and the other was run over by a vehicle, Bukhari said. Authorities did not reply to a query seeking to confirm the deaths.Meanwhile, Amnesty International said the govt must fully protect the rights of protesters and rescind ""shoot-on-sight"" orders that it said gave undue and excessive powers to military.Khan's supporters dismantled roadblocks that had been put in place to stop them while patriotic songs blared from vehicles. Some danced in front of the slow-moving convoy, some chanting, ""Revolution! Revolution!"" When they reached the square late afternoon, some chanted ""Prisoner Number 804"" - a reference to Khan - while others climbed atop shipping containers that had been set up to block their advance.PTI workers, many of them brandishing slingshots and sticks, engaged security personnel in combat as they attempted to make way to D-Chowk, a central square in front of parliament located close to key govt buildings such as the presidency, the PM office, and the supreme court.

Imran Khan's supporters arrive near Pakistan parliament; govt calls in army,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imran-khans-supporters-arrive-near-pakistan-parliament-govt-calls-in-army/articleshow/115708656.cms,"A supporters of imprisoned former premier Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party

ISLAMABAD: Thousands of protesters demanding the release of former prime minister Imran Khan arrived at the heart of Pakistan’s heavily fortified capital, Islamabad, on Tuesday amid intense teargas shelling and use of rubber bullets by security forces, even as the govt invoked Article 245 of the constitution, which allows a civilian govt to call in the army to help it implement law and order.At least four security personnel and two civilians were killed in overnight clashes between security forces and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) supporters. Interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said three Rangers (paramilitary force) personnel and one police constable were killed by miscreants. The Imran-Khan-led PTI denied the allegations, saying security officials were crushed by police and Rangers’ vehicles speeding away from protesters.“Under Article 245, the Pakistan army has been called in, and orders have been issued to deal with the miscreants with an iron hand,” the state-run Radio Pakistan reported. “Clear orders have also been issued to shoot miscreants and troublemakers on sight,” it added.On Tuesday, PTI workers, many of them brandishing slingshots and sticks, engaged security personnel in combat as they attempted to make their way to D-Chowk (Democracy Chowk), a central square in front of parliament.Imran’s wife, Bushra Bibi, was leading the protest with Ali Amin Gandapur, CM of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province where PTI is in govt, accompanying her.

You also promise me that you will not leave until Khan comes out. If anyone tells you otherwise, it is a lie.”Gandapur urged protesters to camp at D-Chowk and not advance further into the Red Zone, housing important places, including the diplomatic enclave.Convoys of protesters had started making their way to Islamabad on Sunday from different parts of the country. Khan’s wife was leading the main convoy from the party’s stronghold of Peshawar. Islamabad has been in security lockdown since Sunday, with authorities closing all schools in the capital and the adjacent garrison city of Rawalpindi. Mobile and internet services have also been partially suspended in the twin cities.All roads and highways from nearby cities to the federal capital, as well as all routes that connect Islamabad and Rawalpindi, have been shut since last weekend.The PTI has been protesting for the release of political prisoners, including Khan. Its second demand is the reversal of the 26th Constitutional Amendment passed by parliament in Oct. The legislation has radically altered the judiciary by setting a fixed term of three years for the Supreme Court’s chief justice, who will now be selected by a parliamentary committee. It has also weakened the powers of the apex court, with constitutional cases and those involving fundamental rights to be heard by constitutional benches that will be constituted by panels dominated by govt representatives. The PTI’s last demand is for the return of its allegedly stolen Feb 8 general election mandate.","At least four security personnel and two civilians were killed in overnight clashes between security forces and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) supporters.
