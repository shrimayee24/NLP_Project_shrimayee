Pakistan Backs China’s Claim That It Mediated In Conflict With India

Pak's belated assertion on conflict pause raises brows

NEW DELHI: Pakistan has endorsed Beijing's claim that it played a mediating role in the May 2025 India-Pakistan conflict that led to Op Sindoor.At a press briefing on Thursday, Pak Foreign Office spokesperson, Tahir Andrabi, said Chinese leaders were ""in constant touch"" with Pakistan's leadership and had also made ""certain contacts with the Indian leadership in those three, four days in May, 6th to 10th and maybe prior to that and after that""""So, I think those contacts, which were characterised by a very positive diplomatic exchanges, they did constitute in bringing down temperatures and trying to bring peace and security in the region. So, I'm sure that the Chinese characterisation of mediation is correct,"" he said.Islamabad's statement, the first-ever about Beijing's alleged role in brokering the pause in the four-day conflict with India, should raise eyebrows because of the lag and because it had so far given the credit for suspension of hostilities exclusively to US President Donald Trump.India had maintained that the military pause followed a request from Pakistan's DGMO to its Indian counterpart, and not the result of any third-party intervention. It dismissed Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi's claim that Beijing had mediated during the crisis.Andrabi said Pakistan shared China's assessment, calling the efforts ""diplomacy for peace, for prosperity, for security"" and that ""this has been the hallmark of a number of international efforts that went into resolving that conflict in those three-four fateful days"". Pakistan, he added, ""firmly"" supported China's position as stated by its foreign minister.China's claim mimics repeated assertions by US President Trump that Washington played a decisive role in ending the confrontation between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.","Pakistan has endorsed Beijing's claim that it played a mediating role in the May 2025 India-Pakistan conflict that led to Op Sindoor.

If even a Dalit icon's portrait had been installed today, we could have struck a blow against the stigma of casteism that has existed for thousands of years. But the Delhi government missed this opportunity and instead installed portraits of two Brahmins. When it comes to installing the portrait of a Dalit icon, they face so much discomfort that they initiated a privilege breach case against MLAs, some of whom are Dalits and from the AAP.""Meanwhile, AAP MLA Kuldeep Kumar said, ""A few days ago, a meeting was held in which we placed a proposal before the Assembly committee. Our MLAs said that Mata Savitribai Phule, whose birth anniversary is today, who opened the first school for women in this country, who faced immense atrocities yet never stopped educating women, should have her portrait installed inside the Delhi Assembly. I say this with great sadness that to suppress our voice, they initiated a privilege breach motion against our members, including against me personally, but they did not install Mata Savitribai Phule's portrait there. Because she spoke about educating women. Because she came from the Dalit community and the backward community, her portrait was not installed.""Pointing to contrasting decisions, Kuldeep Kumar added, ""Inside the Assembly, the entire government, along with the central government spent lakhs of rupees to install portraits of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Madan Mohan Malaviya. We have no objection to that. But we say this clearly that if you insult Dalit heroes and show hatred towards them, then we will not tolerate a BJP that insults Mata Savitribai Phule and refuses to install her portrait on her birth anniversary while installing portraits of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Madan Mohan Malaviya. This is their anti-Dalit mentality.""","AAP Delhi unit chief Saurabh Bharadwaj and Kondli MLA Kuldeep Kumar emphasised that the government not only failed to acknowledge a dalit icon who laid the foundation of women's education in India, but also went a step further by initiating a privilege breach case against MLAs who raised the demand.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126325868,imgsize-868358,width-400,resizemode-4/aap-launches-anti-dalit-attack-at-bjp.jpg"

NEW DELHI: A Meitei civil society organisation has written to PM Modi flagging concerns over letters sent by a Chin Kuki Zo group to foreign govts and United Nations bodies, warning that such outreach could undermine India’s sovereignty, judicial authority and national security amid the ongoing Manipur crisis. It urged Centre to review security policy, re-examine Suspension of Operations agreements and pursue a lawful, permanent resolution that protects all indigenous communities and Manipur’s territorial integrity. Copies of the memorandum were also marked to home minister Amit Shah.In a memorandum dated January 3, Meitei Heritage Society said communications issued by the Kuki Alliance for Nampi Awakening Movement (KANAM) seek to “delegitimise and internationalise” an order of NGT directing an immediate halt to construction of an allegedly illegal road in Manipur’s hill areas. The road — popularly referred to as the German Road or Tiger Road — was built without statutory approvals or mandatory environmental clearance and is “allegedly used by Chin Kuki Zo militants or armed groups for drug trafficking and weapons smuggling,” the memorandum said.The society argued that portraying a judicial order as “institutional violence” and “collective punishment,” and projecting it as grounds for foreign intervention, challenges India’s constitutional framework.“Such actions risk setting a dangerous precedent whereby internal judicial processes are selectively escalated to foreign govts and multilateral bodies,” it stated.The Meitei Heritage Society urged the PM to take note of the foreign communications, direct the ministry of home affairs to undertake a comprehensive policy and security review, re-examine SoO agreements with Chin Kuki Zo militant groups, and pursue a “permanent, just and lawful solution to the Manipur crisis that protects all indigenous communities and preserves Manipur and India’s territorial integrity.”Placing the issue in context, the memorandum said the Manipur crisis, which erupted into large-scale violence on May 3, 2023, has increasingly been framed through competing international narratives. It alleged that Chin Kuki Zo organisations and individuals have previously approached the UN, the US and other foreign actors with what it described as “fabricated, one-sided narratives,” while “masquerading as tribal bodies by using misleading tribal names. ”The memorandum said such groups have received financial and logistical support, training and backing from foreign Christian organisations and former US military personnel, raising questions over compliance with FCRA norms and calling for scrutiny by India’s security agencies. These actions, it alleged, contributed to radicalisation and militarisation, exacerbating crisis.","A Meitei civil society organisation has written to PM Modi flagging concerns over letters sent by a Chin Kuki Zo group to foreign govts and United Nations bodies.

Supreme Court Stays Its Order On Aravalli Definition, Environment Minister Welcomes Move

JAISALMER/JAIPUR: In a controversial move, the Rajasthan govt has overnight redrawn the boundaries of the Barmer and Balotra districts, prompting significant administrative shifts and igniting political row over the timing and intent.A revenue department notification dated December 31, which surfaced publicly on the night of January 2, has altered sub-divisions and shifted thousands of voters in a region bordering Pakistan.Under the revised boundaries, the Baytoo sub-division has been transferred from Balotra back to Barmer, while Barmer's Gudamalani and Dhorimana sub-divisions have been reassigned to Balotra. Following this reorganization, Balotra district now consists of five sub-divisions-Balotra, Sindhari, Siwana, Dhorimana, and Gudamalani-along with nine tehsils and five sub-tehsils.In contrast, Barmer will now include seven sub-divisions-Barmer, Gadra Road, Chohtan, Ramsar, Baytoo, Sedwa, and Sheo-along with eleven tehsils and seven sub-tehsils.The move has drawn attention because it comes just as administrative boundaries have been frozen from Jan 1 due to the Census process, with restrictions continuing until May 2027. Critics allege the govt acted just before the freeze to make the order harder to reverse and to shield it under census-related rules, also linking the reorganisation to future delimitation and electoral calculations.Balotra was carved out of Barmer as a separate district on August 7, 2023, by the previous Congress-led govt. The current BJP-led govt says the latest changes follow fresh recommendations of the Panwar committee, a high-level panel set up to review the 17 new districts and three new divisions created earlier.A revenue department official denied political pressure behind the decision. The notification went viral Friday night, with some initially claiming it appeared edited, before political reactions poured in from both sides. BJP workers celebrated the decision, while Congress members protested and called it anti-people and politically motivated.The boundary shift is expected to affect around 2.5 lakh voters across the impacted tehsils and could reshape local political equations. In Baytoo assembly constituency-Baytoo, Patodi and Gida tehsils-earlier all three were in Balotra; now Baytoo has moved to Barmer while Patodi and Gida remain in Balotra. In Gudamalani assembly-Gudamalani, Dhorimana and Nokhda tehsils-Gudamalani and Dhorimana have moved to Balotra while Nokhda remains with Barmer.Congress MLA Harish Chaudhary, who contests from Baytoo, alleged the tehsils were broken for political purposes and posted a poetic comment on X: ""Send me here or send me there. Playing with maps, send me wherever you want. I won't fear or bow to the changing borders. I stand with my people, send me wherever you want.""Barmer MP Ummeda Ram Beniwal termed the decision a ""Tughlaq-like decree,"" while former minister Hemaram Chaudhary questioned the practicality of shifting Dhorimana and parts of Gudamalani, saying the changes do not match ground realities or public convenience. He said a peaceful protest is underway in Dhorimana against the state govt's decision on the Dhorimana and Gudamalani sub-divisions.",The Rajasthan govt has redrawn the boundaries of the Barmer and Balotra districts.

NEW DELHI: Blowing the bugle for restoration of job guarantee scheme with a 45-day ' MGNREGA bachao sangram' from January 8, Congress on Saturday said it will also legally challenge VB-GRAMG in court because it violates a key provision of the Constitution.As it released a three-level agitation plan which will see outreach at panchayat level and end with four national rallies, Congress' K C Venguopal and Jairam Ramesh said the nationwide struggle with maximum mobilisation will force Modi govt to restore the job guarantee scheme just like it had to roll back the three 'black farm laws'.AICC clarified the 45-day programme is the first-phase of the 'sangram' which will be extended beyond Feb 25.

NEW DELHI: After pushing organisation cohesion and laying out BJP's agenda in West Bengal, home minister Amit Shah will be in another poll-bound state Tamil Nadu for two days from Sunday to give shape to the party's strategy, where it is a junior partner to AIADMK, but will have to play a key role in guiding the alliance that faces a host of knotty issues.Shah's schedule includes attending the closing ceremony of a state-wide yatra in Pudukkottai - which was led by BJP Tamil Nadu president Nainar Nagendran and has championed Tamil pride to counter the governing DMK-led alliance's projection of the party as an organisation arraigned against the state's values; presiding over a meeting of key BJP leaders and attending Pongal celebration.Sources said key BJP allies, including AIADMK general secretary Edappadi K Palaniswami, may also meet Shah.His visit to the southern state is expected to push efforts for NDA's expansion, which has hit roadblocks. While PMK, a BJP ally in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls when AIADMK had fought separately, has split into two factions, one led by its founder S Ramadoss and the other by his son Anbumani Ramadoss, another prospective ally DMDK, founded by actor Vijayakant and now headed by his widow Premallatha Vijayakant, is yet to finalise its stand.That BJP and Palaniswami, known as EPS, do not see eye to eye on the course the alliance must take to put up a strong contest against the DMK-Congress-Left alliance amid emergence of popular actor Vijay-led Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK), which has succeeded in draw a few regional satraps, especially from AIADMK, to its fold.While BJP is believed to be a votary of former AIADMK functionaries like O Panneerselvam and TTV Dhinakaran, who either quit or were expelled from the party due to their differences with EPS, returning to their parent party to project a picture of organisational unity and revival, EPS remains wary of welcoming them back, apprehending that they may challenge his grip over AIADMK.Union minister Piyush Goyal was in Tamil Nadu recently after being appointed as BJP's election in-charge of the state and met EPS, NDA functionaries from the state are of the view that it will require Shah to step in and reach out to current and prospective allies to expand NDA. With his proven political skills and electoral track record, Shah has the authority and mojo to get them around to joining ranks for defeating DMK, which someone like EPS may lack despite AIADMK being the senior partner as his party has struggled to challenge CM M K Stalin.BJP brass will also need to bring its own house in order as its former president Annamalai, popular among the core BJP supporters, has been lying low and, at times, skipped key meetings.","Home minister Amit Shah will be in another poll-bound state Tamil Nadu for two days from Sunday.

INDORE: In Bhagirathpura, mornings no longer begin with the clang of utensils and the rush to fill water pots. In the country's cleanest city, people now pause before drinking water.The densely populated neighbourhood in Indore district, home largely to daily-wage workers and small shop employees, is still coming to terms with the deaths caused by contaminated drinking water.Parvati Suryavanshi, 62, frail and recovering from severe diarrhoea, waits for a tanker outside her house.

MP pollution board probe found toxic water across Indore

BHOPAL/INDORE: A recent Union govt assessment under the Jal Jeevan Mission had found that 36.7% of drinking water samples from rural Madhya Pradesh were not potable, highlighting risks in village water supply systems amid outrage at the deaths of 10 people in Indore linked to contaminated drinking water supplied by the urban administration.A state Pollution Control Board report of 2016-17, meanwhile, had flagged sewage contamination at Bhagirathpura, and at 58 other Indore locations, years ago. Expersts said the report indicated faecal contamination.The deaths reported from Bhagirathpura after residents consumed contaminated drinking water revived uncomfortable questions about warnings that were formally documented years ago but failed to translate into sustained corrective action. The Union govt’s Functionality Assessment of Household Tap Connections 2024 covered 15,094 rural households between Sept and Oct 2024 and was released last month.Water samples were collected from two households per source/scheme... and tested for three types of parameters: E Coli, total coliform in NABL-accredited labs, and on-site testing for pH, the Union govt assessment under Jal Jeevan Mission stated. In Indore district, only 33% of surveyed rural households received potable water, which officials described as below acceptable levels.District-wise findings showed a wide variation. Alirajpur, Barwani, Jhabua, Narsinghpur and Sidhi reported 100% availability of potable water among surveyed households, while Anuppur, Dindori, Panna, Rewa and Umaria recorded zero potable samples. Other districts reported low levels of potable water, including Gwalior (20.9%), Ashoknagar (21.9%), Morena (25.2%), Damoh (33.5%), Khandwa (35.2%), Ujjain (35.3%) and Shivpuri (36.4%). Bhopal (56.9%) and Jabalpur (54.3%) were close to the halfway mark.The survey also flagged operational gaps. About 23.4% of households reported not receiving regular tap water supply, while 36.7% did not have functional taps at the time of the survey. Only 3.7% of respondents expressed dissatisfaction with water quality, but nearly 22% said the quantity supplied was inadequate, indicating that safety issues may be under-reported or not easily detected by consumers.Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board’s ground-level investigation in 2016-17 found groundwater contamination across Indore, including Bhagirathpura. The study covered 60 locations across city where samples were drawn from borewells, hand pumps and other groundwater sources used by residents. Lab analysis found total coliform levels exceeding 10 MPN per 100ml in nearly all samples.Scientists associated with the testing, speaking on condition of anonymity, said such levels clearly indicated faecal contamination caused by sewage ingress into groundwater sources. “At this level, the water is unfit for human consumption,” one retired scientist said. Both total coliform and faecal coliform tests were conducted as part of the assessment.The state PCB formally communicated the findings to IMC, recommending that the affected water sources be declared unsafe for drinking. Among the measures suggested were the installation of display boards and warning stickers at contaminated hand pumps and borewells, along with steps to prevent sewage mixing with water lines. Officials said the report made it clear that groundwater in large parts of Indore could not be considered potable due to persistent sewage contamination, particularly in areas with old pipelines, inadequate drainage separation, and waterlogging.",A recent Union government assessment revealed significant disparities in potable water availability across rural Madhya Pradesh.

‘Won’t Serve The 1%’: Zohran Mamdani Promises ‘New Era’ To New Yorkers In First Speech As Mayor

Mamdani's letter to Umar Khalid







NEW DELHI: Student activist Umar Khalid, who has been in jail for nearly five years in connection with the Feb 2020 Delhi riots , has received a show of solidarity from New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani , who wrote to him, saying, ""we are all thinking of you"".The note, undated, was shared on X by Khalid's partner Banojyotsna Lahiri on Thursday, after Mamdani was sworn in as mayor in a midnight ceremony.In the handwritten note, Mamdani said: ""Dear Umar, I think of your words on bitterness often, and the importance of not letting it consume oneself. It was a pleasure to meet your parents. We are all thinking of you."" TOI reached out to Mamdani's office about the note; there was no response at the time of going to press.Khalid, a former JNU student, was arrested in Sept 2020 and charged under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) for allegedly conspiring to incite riots in Delhi, charges he has consistently denied. Khalid was granted temporary bail in Dec to attend his sister's wedding.Khalid’s father, Syed Qasim Rasool Ilyas, told TOI that the family met Mamdani early Dec last year during a visit to the United States to meet Khalid’s sister.Ilyas said he had sought time from Mamdani to congratulate him on his appointment and ended up meeting him and his wife for around half an hour. “He gave us time exclusively and we discussed many things, including Umar’s incarceration. We hoped he would fulfil the promises he has made for the people of New York,” he said.“We also spoke about what has been happening to my son and the developments around his case. Mamdani said he follows it and has read Umar’s letters from jail,” he added.“This prolonged incarceration itself is unjust, and that is why it has attracted international attention,” Lahiri said.Ilyas said he also met Democrat Jamie Raskin of the US Congress separately. “He raised concerns over Umar’s arrest and extended support,” he said. “I told him the matter is currently before Supreme Court and the family is positive about a favourable outcome.” Raskin shared a photograph online with Ilyas and his wife.Raskin, along with three other US Congress members, wrote to India’s ambassador to the United States, Vinay Mohan Kwatra, on Dec 30, expressing concern over Khalid’s continued pre-trial detention. The lawmakers said Khalid has been denied bail for five years under UAPA, arguing that the “pre-trial treatment to which he has been subjected is punitive in and of itself”.","Student activist Umar Khalid has been in jail for nearly five years in connection with the Feb 2020 Delhi riots.

Cleanliness Crown Cracks As Indore Loses 13 Lives To Poisoned Water And Administrative Lapses

INDORE: A deathly silence prevails in Bhagirathpura area of Indore. Barring a few people at makeshift medical camps, its lanes are empty. With over 200 people from the area admitted in as many as 27 hospitals across the city after being afflicted with diarrhoea, most residents have been away attending to the ill since Monday night when they began vomiting and developed high fever. Nine persons have died till now.Tragedy struck Bhagirathpura when a pit to clear waste from a toilet built at the local police check post began leaking, leading to the waste water mixing with the main water supply line that ran just beneath it. Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) officials said the contractor had channeled the output from the toilet to a pit above the main water supply line rather than constructing a septic tank and connecting it to the sewage line.On Thursday, even as Madhya Pradesh govt officials scrambled to fix responsibility, spruce up treatment facilities, and clean up the water supply system, Sadhana Sahu, a teacher at a private school, sat on the doorstep of her home in Bhagirathpura and wept uncontrollably. She has lost her six-month-old son. ""Abhyan was born 10 years after we had a daughter. Bas, mera bachcha nahin raha (My child is no more),"" Sadhana said.Abhyan's father, Sunil Sahu, who works from home for an internet firm, said, ""He had diarrhoea and fever. We took him to a doctor on Dec 26. We brought him back home after he was prescribed medicines. He was fine the next two days but suddenly developed high fever, vomited, and died at home on Monday. We couldn't even take him to a hospital.""""The contaminated water caused his death. I had mixed water with his milk and his health deteriorated,"" Sadhana said.Wailing could be heard from some of the homes where death had struck. Almost every household in Bhagirathpura - which has a population of about 15,000, most from economically weak sections living cheek-by-jowl - has one or more people afflicted.""We earn little and barely manage to survive,"" said Alguram Yadav of Borasi ki Gali. His wife Urmila, 65, died on Sunday. His son Sanju, daughter-in-law Roshini and grandson Shivam (11 months) are admitted to hospitals with the same symptoms that took Urmila's life.""Nobody had turned up to help, though some administrative officials came to check.

Brian Harpole, Candace Owens, and the video that sparked online debate





A newly resurfaced video has put fresh focus on the death of Charlie Kirk, weeks after he was shot at a public event. The clip shows Brian Harpole, who was part of Kirk’s security team, standing in the crowd shortly before the shooting. The video began spreading on X in late December 2025 and quickly caught public attention. Many people online are now asking questions about what happened just before the attack. Some users are urging Candace Owens to look into the footage. At the same time, police have been clear. They say Tyler Robinson is the only suspect in custody, and no official report has linked Harpole to the killing.The shooting took place at Utah Valley University on 10 September 2025 during a Turning Point USA event. While the video has raised debate online, authorities say the investigation has not changed.The video at the center of the discussion is made up of short clips from the event. In the footage, a man believed by some X users to be Brian Harpole is seen standing among attendees. His arms are folded, and one hand is partly hidden. Some viewers say this looks strange. Others say the clip shows nothing unusual and no sign of a weapon or violent act.The video gained attention after it was posted by Blake Bednarz on 29 December 2025. Bednarz wrote that the man in the video “had his folded arms with right hand hidden under his armpit when he squeezed.” Other users pushed back right away. They said the clip lacks clear context and does not prove anything.As the clip spread, several users asked Candace Owens to review it. One user, Katie Ash, wrote on 30 December 2025, “I have been screaming this since Candace and Erika’s meeting!” Another account said the video looked important but asked how such claims could be proven. Some reactions were emotional, with users saying the situation was upsetting, while others questioned how the event was handled.Candace Owens had already mentioned Harpole on her podcast on 9 December 2025. She said, “I received SHOCKING information which puts Charlie Kirk’s last trip to Asia in a new light. And it involves his security detail, Brian Harpole.” Candace Owens added that the claim came from a man in witness protection. She did not share documents or proof. Police have not confirmed her claim and continue to say Robinson is the only suspect.Brian Harpole is a former Texas police officer with 14 years of experience. He later started Integrity Security Solutions. In November 2025, he appeared on The Shawn Ryan Show and spoke about security planning. He said about the venue choice, “That’s where they told us to have it.” No evidence has tied him to the shooting.Also Read: Candace Owens Highlights New Claims Raising Serious Questions After Eyewitness Mitch Snow Shares Details On Charlie Kirk Death Timeline","A newly resurfaced video has put fresh focus on the death of Charlie Kirk, weeks after he was shot at a public event.

Journalist Caolan Robertson raises doubts as Minnesota daycare video spreads (Image via Getty)

Caolan Robertson raises doubts over Nick Shirley’s reporting style and Minnesota fraud claims







Nick Shirley’s viral Minnesota daycare video is now facing fresh questions after Irish journalist Caolan Robertson said Shirley once told him his work was “satire,” not real journalism. The claim comes as Shirley’s recent fraud allegations continue to spread online and gain attention from high-profile figures.Shirley’s Minnesota video, posted in mid-December, suggested daycare centers were empty while receiving public funds. The clip went viral and was even retweeted by JD Vance on December 28. In his post, Vance praised Shirley’s work and called it “far more useful” than the 2024 Pulitzer Prize-winning reporting.But Robertson says Shirley’s past actions raise serious doubts. Robertson, who previously interviewed Shirley in Ukraine, says Shirley made videos suggesting there was no war happening there. When confronted in Kyiv, Robertson claims Shirley admitted his work was not journalism.“When I confronted Nick about what he did here in Kyiv, he said what he was doing wasn’t journalism, it was satire, and his entire reporting started to fall apart,” Robertson said.Robertson shared a clip from their interview to support his claim. He also said people who guided Shirley in Kyiv later told him Shirley was shown bombed locations, including a children’s hospital, but chose not to show them in his videos.Robertson believes Shirley follows the same pattern wherever he goes. He says Shirley films a small area, makes big claims, and then moves on without showing full facts.“Nick has a very specific talent. He shows up somewhere, films a couple of streets, announces he’s cracked the whole story. No data, no depth. Just vibes,” Robertson said. “Then we jump to Minneapolis. It’s the same tactic — drop in, film selectively, inflame, provoke, declare victory, go viral.”One location featured in Shirley’s Minnesota video was ABC Learning Center in Minneapolis. Shirley suggested the daycare was empty. But when CBS News visited the center later in December, reporters found more than a dozen children inside, along with several staff members.Director Ahmed Hasan told CBS News the children were working on math and basic language skills. His wife, Umi Hasan, who helps run the center, said she believes Shirley’s video was politically motivated.“We pay our taxes. We do whatever we can to be a law-abiding citizen. When one Somali does something wrong, we all get collective punishment,” Umi Hasan said.Ahmed Hasan also said the center received constant phone calls from people outside Minnesota after the video went viral, adding to stress for staff and families.Also Read: Who Is Nick Shirley?

The case of the football coach who vanished on Christmas Day







A weeks-long search that began with worry and hope has ended in tragedy in Gloucester County. Authorities confirmed that a body believed to be missing football coach Stephen Iannotti was found on December 31. Iannotti, 72, disappeared on Christmas Day, triggering an intense investigation and a growing sense of concern across the area where he was widely known and respected.For decades, Iannotti served as a math teacher and football coach in New Jersey. He was more than an educator to many. He was a familiar and trusted presence. When he failed to respond to calls on Christmas, family members alerted the police. A welfare check at his Logan Township home found no sign of him, marking the start of a search that would deeply affect his family.Investigators later revealed that Stephen Iannotti ’s phone had been left inside his home. This detail matched what relatives explained was his usual habit of leaving without it. Officials later confirmed that he had been located, but the outcome was tragic. Authorities said he was deceased and added that, out of respect for his family and privacy, no further updates would be shared on the case.According to law enforcement updates reported by NJ.com, home surveillance footage showed Iannotti’s black Jeep Wrangler leaving his residence at 12:45 p.m.on the Friday after Christmas. Minutes later, a license plate reader recorded the vehicle near Center Square Road and Heron Drive. Officials confirmed there was no evidence that he crossed toll bridges or monitored waterways during that time.Police said the family fully cooperated with the investigation. Officers were allowed into the home to check if anything appeared unusual. Bank records showed no activity after Christmas, and investigators noted that Iannotti rarely used credit or debit cards. Because of specific state guidelines, the case did not qualify for a Silver Alert. Still, his name and vehicle were entered into the national missing persons database. Throughout the search, authorities repeatedly said there were no signs of foul play. The cause of death is still under investigation.The loss has hit Gloucester County hard. Commissioner Christopher Konawel Jr. said the massive response to the search reflected how deeply admired Iannotti was. He described the concern and police effort as proof of the coach’s impact. Konawel also shared a personal memory, saying Iannotti was more than a teacher or coach, he was like a family member who will be missed.Also Read: Luke Humphries rewards his recent success with $200k Lamborghini as he eyes another world title","Stephen Iannotti, 72, disappeared on Christmas Day, triggering an intense investigation and a growing sense of concern across the area where he was widely known and respected.

Who is Christian Sturdivant? ISIS-inspired teen captured by FBI before he could pull off 'terrorist attack' in North Carolina on New Year’s Eve,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-christian-sturdivant-isis-inspired-teen-captured-by-fbi-before-he-could-pull-off-a-terrorist-attack-in-north-carolina-on-new-years-eve/articleshow/126311946.cms,"



An 18-year-old from Mint Hill, North Carolina, is accused of plotting a deadly New Year’s Eve attack in support of the Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham, before FBI agents moved in to stop him.The suspect was identified as Christian Sturdivant, who planned to stab civilians at public locations using knives, firearms and hammers, with the aim of killing as many people as possible.Sturdivant was arrested on December 31, 2025, and has been charged with attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organisation. The criminal complaint was unsealed after he appeared in federal court in Charlotte. He remains in custody.Officials said the alleged plot targeted a grocery store and a fast food restaurant and was in its final stages. Attorney General Pam Bondi said, “This successful collaboration between federal and local law enforcement saved American lives from a horrific terrorist attack on New Year’s Eve.”According to court documents, the FBI became aware of Sturdivant on December 18, 2025, after receiving information about social media posts in which he praised ISIS , a designated terrorist organisation by many countries. Earlier that month, he allegedly shared an image mocking Christianity, accompanied by hateful language similar to ISIS propaganda calling for violence against non-believers.According to the FBI, Sturdivant began communicating online with an undercover federal agent posing as an ISIS supporter. During those conversations, Sturdivant allegedly said, “I will do jihad soon,” and referred to himself as “a soldier of the state,” a phrase linked to ISIS.On December 14, he sent the federal agent an image showing two hammers and a knife. Prosecutors say the image was similar to ISIS propaganda encouraging knife attacks in Western countries. On December 19, he allegedly sent a voice recording pledging loyalty to ISIS.FBI Director Kash Patel said, “The accused allegedly wanted to be a soldier for ISIS and made plans to commit a violent attack on New Year’s Eve in support of that terrorist group, but the FBI and our partners put a stop to that.”A search of Sturdivant’s home on December 29 uncovered handwritten notes, including one titled “New Years Attack 2026”. Prosecutors say the document listed equipment such as a vest, mask, tactical gloves and knives, and described a plan to stab up to 20 or 21 civilians. The note also includes a so-called “martyrdom op” in which Sturdivant intended to attack police responding to the scene so he would die as a martyr.John A. Eisenberg, Assistant Attorney General for National Security, said, “As alleged, Sturdivant aspired to become a ‘martyr’ for ISIS and was in the final stages of planning a mass-casualty attack on New Year’s Eve.”The FBI said they found two butcher knives and two hammers hidden under Sturdivant’s bed, along with a list of targets and tactical gear. Investigators believe these items matched those shown in messages sent to the undercover contact.If convicted, Sturdivant faces up to 20 years in federal prison. Prosecutors said that the charges remain allegations and that he is presumed innocent unless proven guilty in court.","Christian Sturdivant, 18, from Mint Hill, North Carolina, is accused of plotting a deadly New Year’s Eve attack in support of the Islamic State in Iraq and al- Sham.

Can the US revoke citizenship? Trump administration weighs denaturalisation in Minnesota fraud case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/can-the-us-revoke-citizenship-trump-administration-weighs-denaturalisation-in-minnesota-fraud-case/articleshow/126278329.cms,"Minnesota Crackdown: DOJ Raids Somali-Americans, 100 Arrested In Shocking Med 'Fraud'





The Trump administration was exploring the denaturalisation of Somali-Americans in Minnesota who engaged in fraud, a move that would seek to strip US citizenship from those who illegally obtained tax dollars intended for social services.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt discussed the potential action in a December 31 appearance on Fox News, one day after the US Department of Health and Human Services froze childcare payments to Minnesota following what the agency said was fraud at daycares in the state.""We're also not afraid to use denaturalization,"" Leavitt said. ""That's a tool at the president and the secretary of state's disposal, and it's one this administration has previously used before.""""Absolutely,"" Leavitt said when asked whether Trump wanted Somali-Americans' citizenship revoked if they were convicted of fraud. “It’s something the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State is currently looking at right now.""Federal prosecutors charged 86 individuals with felonies for exploiting federal tax dollars intended to help hungry children during the COVID-19 pandemic for personal gain.More than 60 pleaded guilty or were convicted so far. The case was originally brought by the Biden administration, US Today reported.Of the 86 people charged in a sprawling $250 million case involving Minnesota-administered programmes, 78 were identified as Somali-Americans. Minnesota was home to about 80,000 Somali immigrants, the largest of any state. Most were naturalised citizens, foreign-born individuals who went through a legal process to gain their citizenship.Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, in a December 30 appearance on The Charlie Kirk Show podcast, said DHS investigators were currently going ""door to door"" to suspected fraud sites in Minnesota ""to make sure we follow the money here and we bring arrests, prosecutions and ultimately removals.""The White House also seized on a recent viral video from conservative influencer Nick Shirley that claimed abandoned daycare centres were receiving millions in state taxpayer dollars. FBI Director Kash Patel on Dec. 28 said his agency had ""surged personnel and investigative resources to Minnesota to dismantle large-scale fraud schemes exploiting federal programs.""Stripping citizenship from naturalised US citizens was rare and had a high bar. Federal courts, not the administration, made the final decisions. Denaturalisation could be pursued through either civil proceedings or a criminal conviction.During President Donald Trump's first term in office, the Justice Department filed 168 denaturalisation cases in federal court, while the Biden administration filed 64 such cases, a database created by Irina Mantra, a Hofstra University law professor, found. An average of 11 denaturalisation cases per year were filed between 1990 and 2007.The general grounds for denaturalisation involved the ""illegal procurement of naturalization"" or the ""concealment of a material fact or willful misrepresentation,"" according to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services, a federal agency. In addition, the federal govt could cite an individual's current or past affiliation with a totalitarian political party or terrorist organisation.Demonstrators rallied in protest against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), amid a reported federal immigration operation targeting the Somali community, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, US, December 8, 2025.Trump called Somali immigrants in Minnesota ""garbage,"" igniting pushback from immigrant rights advocates who argued the White House's focus on the Minnesota fraud case was an excuse to target the immigrant population. Trump and Republicans blamed Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the 2024 Democratic vice presidential nominee, for allowing the fraud to unfold.Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minnesota, a close ally of Trump, called for the denaturalisation of Somali-Americans convicted of fraud in a Dec. 30 post on Facebook.“I have three words regarding Somalis who have committed fraud against American taxpayers: Send them home. If they’re here illegally, deport them immediately; if they’re naturalized citizens, revoke their citizenship and deport them quickly thereafter,"" Emmer said.","White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt discussed the potential action in a December 31 appearance on Fox News.

Speaking in a recent interview, Errol Musk warned that America would ‘collapse’ if the white population becomes a minority within the next two decades, calling the shift “a very, very bad thing to happen. ”Musk raised questions about the implications of the demographic change, asking, “You want to see the U.S. go down? Why? You don’t like electric cars, and you don’t like technology? What is it, you want to go back to the jungle?” Along with this, he also spoke about South Africa, claiming that the “small white population that projects the European culture” has contributed significantly to the growth and development of the Black African population.

It’s so terrible, you can’t believe it.”In 1998, Errol Musk admitted that he killed three people insisting that it was an act of self-defence. Initially he was arrested but was later released after the charges were dropped. The incident was dded to the long list of controversies surrounding him which further fulled Elon Musk’s distrust.Elon Musk has repeatedly emphasised that his father’s words cannot be trusted. Reflecting on his attempts to mend their relationship, Musk said, “In my experience, there is nothing you can do. Nothing, nothing. I wish. I’ve tried everything.

Trump Details Final Seconds Of Maduro's Capture: Fortress, Steel Doors, Gunfire & Failed Bid To Flee





The man US President Donald Trump has alleged is a narco-terrorist is also a devotee of the famed late Indian godman Sri Sathya Baba of Puttaparthi.Maduro, who was raised Catholic, reportedly became an ardent follower of the fuzzy-haired Sai Baba through his wife Cilia Flores, a lawyer and lawmaker in her own right, who was a devotee long before she married Maduro.It was Flores who brought Maduro to India long before they got married to meet Sai Baba in 2005, when she was a lawyer for former President Hugo Chavez and Maduro was speaker of the Assembly. Flores eventually replaced Maduro as the speaker when he was appointed foreign minister.Photographs of the Flores-Maduro trip to Prashanti Nilayam show them seated at Sai Baba’s feet after they were granted a private audience. Visitors to the Miraflores Presidential Palace in Caracas have also seen a large, framed portrait of Sai Baba in Maduro’s private office, placed alongside revolutionary figures like Simon Bolivar and his predecessor Hugo Chavez.When Sai Baba passed away in April 2011, Maduro, by then foreign minister in the Chavez government, got the Venezuelan National Assembly to pass an official condolence resolution.Venezuela declared a day of national mourning to honour the guru's ""spiritual contribution to humanity.""He also spoke glowingly of Sai Baba and India’s spiritual cachet in one of his many rants against the United States, even as he and his scandal-ridden family, including Flores and her children, were investigated by US agencies for drug running.Most recently, on November 23, 2025, he released an official statement celebrating the 100th anniversary of Sai Baba’s birth, calling the godman a ""being of light"" and stating that the memory of their meeting ""renews in me the strength of his eternal message.""Under Maduro's administration, the Sathya Sai organisation has flourished in Venezuela, operating schools and human value institutes even as other foreign NGOs faced restrictions.As Maduro and Flores were perp-walked into Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center, famous for its squalid conditions and other “celebrity” inmates like Sean “Diddy” Combs and Luigi Mangione, they will need all of the late Baba’s divine blessings and powers to spring free.The last Latin American strongman who was prosecuted on drug charges and incarcerated in the US in 1992, Manuel Noreiga of Panama, spent nearly 20 years in prison before he was released as a sick and broken man, dying of brain tumor at 83.","Venezuelan President Maduro is a devotee of the late Indian godman Sri Sathya Baba of Puttaparthi.

'Will Sell To China, Russia': Trump Lays Out Plans For Venezuelan Oil After Maduro Capture

.

Why did the US attack and capture Maduro?





The United States carried out pre-dawn airstrikes across Venezuela on Saturday, with at least seven explosions and low-flying aircraft reported over the capital, Caracas. The attacks, which killed at least 40 people, prompted the Venezuelan government to declare a national emergency and deploy its armed forces, calling for mass mobilisation. Hours later, US President Donald Trump announced that American forces had captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, flown them out of the country, and placed them in US custody.Trump later posted an image on his Truth Social platform showing a blindfolded Maduro aboard a US warship, captioned: “Nicolas Maduro on board the USS Iwo Jima.”The US justice department said Maduro and Flores will face trial in New York after a fresh indictment issued on Saturday accused them of involvement in narco-terrorism, The Guardian reported. US Attorney General Pam Bondi said the couple had been charged with drug- and weapons-related offences.At least seven explosions and low-flying aircraft were reported over Caracas, including near military bases, BBC News and AP said. Venezuelan authorities accused the US of striking civilian and military installations and urged citizens to take to the streets.Calling it the most direct US military action in Latin America since the 1989 invasion of Panama, The Guardian noted the operation stunned the international community.Despite Trump’s claim that the US would decide Venezuela’s future, Venezuelan state television continued broadcasting pro-government messages, while the military appeared to retain control over key installations.Speaking at a Mar-a-Lago news conference, US President Donald Trump said the US would temporarily govern Venezuela. “We’re going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition,” he said, adding that American oil companies would move into the country. Trump boasted that “no nation in the world could achieve what America achieved"", AP reported.The strikes and capture followed months of an aggressive US pressure campaign mounted on Venezuela's Maduro after US President Donald Trump took office for a second term.According to the BBC News, Trump has repeatedly accused Maduro of fueling illegal immigration into the US and being responsible for the movement of drugs including fentanyl and cocaine into American cities, claims experts have said lack public evidence. Trump has portrayed Venezuela’s government as illegitimate and blamed it for destabilising the region.The US designated Venezuelan gangs such as Tren de Aragua and Cartel de los Soles as terrorist organisations and alleged that the latter was led by Maduro himself. Washington had earlier announced a $50 million bounty for information leading to Maduro’s arrest.Over recent months, US forces carried out more than two dozen strikes in international waters on boats alleged to be carrying drugs.Relations between the two countries have been strained since Hugo Chávez came to power in 1999 and worsened after Maduro succeeded him in 2013. The US stopped recognising Maduro as Venezuela’s legitimate leader in 2019 and backed the opposition. After Venezuela’s disputed 2024 election, which independent experts said the opposition won, Maduro remained in power following a crackdown.Trump has openly spoken about regime change and access to resources. Following Maduro’s capture, he invoked the Monroe Doctrine — which he dubbed the “Don-Roe doctrine” — declaring: “American dominance in the western hemisphere will never be questioned again.”The legality of the operation has been questioned, with Congress not having authorised the use of force, AP reported. Venezuela’s Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez demanded Maduro’s release, insisting on state television: “There is only one president in Venezuela, and his name is Nicolás Maduro Moros.”","US carried out pre-dawn airstrikes across Venezuela on Saturday, with at least seven explosions and low-flying aircraft reported over the capital, Caracas.

Maduro Lands In US: FBI Escorts Handcuffed Venezuelan President; THUMBS UP At DEA Office On Cam





The first video of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro arriving in the United States was released on Saturday (local time), showing him handcuffed and escorted by US officials as he stepped off a helicopter at New York’s Stewart Airport.Hours earlier, Maduro was captured by US forces during a late-night operation in Venezuela. US President Donald Trump had also shared the first image of Maduro in custody, showing him handcuffed and blindfolded aboard a US warship.After landing in New York, a motorcade believed to be carrying Maduro exited the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) headquarters on Manhattan’s West Side Highway before briefly heading north and then returning to a heliport, according to BBC.Officials said Maduro and his wife, First Lady Cilia Flores, were flown by helicopter to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. Three helicopters were seen travelling down the Hudson River, passing the Statue of Liberty, before landing. From there, the couple were transported to the detention facility in a convoy of law enforcement vehicles.According to US authorities, Maduro was arrested in Venezuela and flown out of the capital, Caracas, in the early hours of Saturday aboard a US helicopter.He was first taken to the USS Iwo Jima at an undisclosed location in the Caribbean Sea.From there, he was flown to the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, before being transferred to another aircraft that took him to Stewart Air Force Base in New York State’s Orange County. He was then flown by helicopter into New York City.In total, Maduro travelled about 2,100 miles (3,300 kilometres) from his capture in Venezuela to his arrival in the United States.Also read: Nicolas Maduro captured; w​ho is in charge of Venezuela now? Trump says US will 'run' the country​​​ US Attorney General Pam Bondi confirmed that Nicolás Maduro and Cilia Flores have been indicted in the Southern District of New York.The charges include conspiracy to commit narco-terrorism, conspiracy to import cocaine into the United States, possession of machine guns and destructive devices and conspiracy to possess such weapons against the US.US media reports said that the booking process for the couple has already begun. This includes taking fingerprints, biometric data and mugshots, along with medical examinations. Their details will then be entered into the US Customs and Border Protection system.Maduro and his wife are expected to be formally produced in court, possibly as early as Monday.Earlier, Trump had shared the first image of Maduro following his capture, posting a photograph of the Venezuelan leader aboard the USS Iwo Jima. “Nicolas Maduro on board the USS Iwo Jima,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.Speaking later on Fox and Friends Weekend, Trump said Maduro and Flores were seized during a night-time operation and flown directly to a US warship. He claimed Maduro had been heavily guarded inside a fortified palace and that US forces had rehearsed the operation in advance.The operation reportedly lasted less than 30 minutes and took place amid explosions in Caracas and other locations. Venezuela’s government condemned the action as a “serious military aggression” and declared a state of emergency, while the US said its forces suffered minimal casualties. Maduro now remains in US custody as legal proceedings move forward in New York.The White House’s official Rapid Response account later posted a video showing what appeared to be a “perp walk” of the ousted Venezuelan leader at the DEA office in Manhattan.The video showed Maduro wearing a black hooded sweatshirt and walking handcuffed alongside DEA agents down a blue-carpeted hallway marked “DEA NYD,” according to CNN.The footage showed Maduro being processed and fingerprinted at the DEA office. As he walked with agents, Maduro appeared to attempt speaking in English.“Good night,” he said, before correcting himself in Spanish: “Es buenas noches, no?” — meaning, “That is good night, no?”He then repeated “good night” to those present and added, “Happy New Year”.","First video of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro arriving in the United States released.

Newly inaugurated New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani on Saturday condemned the US military capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife.The socialist democrat called it an ""act of war and a violation of federal and international law.""At a news conference, Mamdani said he had spoken to US President Donald Trump by phone to voice his opposition to the military operation and the attempt to change Venezuela’s government.Mamdani said: ""I called the president and spoke with him directly to register my opposition to this act and to make clear that it was an opposition based on being opposed to a pursuit of regime change, to the violation of federal international law and a desire to see that be consistent each and every day. I registered my opposition, I made it clear and we left it at that.""US President Trump had announced the capture earlier in the day, describing it as a ""large scale strike"" following months of US assaults on suspected drug vessels allegedly tied to the Venezuelan regime in the Caribbean Sea and Eastern Pacific. The Venezuelan government issued a statement condemning the attack, describing it as an ""attempt to impose a colonial war to destroy the republican form of government and force a ‘regime change,’ in alliance with the fascist oligarchy.Mamdani later took to X to highlight the potential impact on New Yorkers, particularly the city’s tens of thousands of Venezuelan residents. ""This blatant pursuit of regime change doesn’t just affect those abroad, it directly impacts New Yorkers, including tens of thousands of Venezuelans who call this city home. My focus is their safety and the safety of every New Yorker, and my administration will continue to monitor the situation and issue relevant guidance,"" he said.The mayor is a democratic socialist who shares some policy similarities with Maduro, including a focus on redistributing wealth.Mamdani has campaigned on taxing the wealthy and corporations to fund public services, while Maduro redistributed wealth through oil revenues and state control of resources. However, Venezuelan socialism has involved nationalisation and centralised control, contributing to economic collapse and authoritarian practices, unlike Mamdani’s localised policy agenda focused on public housing, childcare, transit and city-owned grocery stores, according to Fox News.","Newly inaugurated New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani condemned the US military capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife.

It’s primitive. It’s horrible. It’s horrible, it’s really horrible.”The GOP leader pledged that American energy companies would help rebuild Venezuela’s infrastructure and did not rule out sending troops back if necessary. “We’re not afraid of boots on the ground…we had boots on the ground last night,” he told reporters.Meanwhile, China condemned the operation as reckless, while some Republican lawmakers supported Trump’s move.

After President Donald Trump announced that Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro had been captured, attention has shifted to where the Latin American leader could be detained while he awaits trial in United States.Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, are currently in US custody and are being taken to New York, where they are expected to face criminal charges, a senior government source told NewsNation.US Attorney General Pam Bondi confirmed after the capture that the couple has been indicted on narco-terrorism, drug trafficking and weapons-related charges.“Maduro and his wife will soon face the full might of American justice and stand trial on American soil,” Trump said.With Trump indicating that Maduro will be taken to New York, officials say he could be held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, the city’s only federal jail. The facility has previously held several high-profile detainees, including music executive Sean “Diddy” Combs.The Metropolitan Detention Center has a troubled reputation. Inmates have repeatedly complained about violence, harsh living conditions, staff shortages and the smuggling of drugs and other contraband.Some detainees have described the jail as “hell on earth”. Past inmates have included R. Kelly, Ghislaine Maxwell and cryptocurrency fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried.Combs himself spent time at the Brooklyn facility before and during his trial.

An old social media post by US director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has resurfaced and gone viral after the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro by American forces, with social media saying that the comment “didn’t age well”.On January 25, 2019, Gabbard wrote on X, then Twitter that US must not intervene in the future of Venezuela: “The United States needs to stay out of Venezuela. Let the Venezuelan people determine their future. We don't want other countries to choose our leaders, so we have to stop trying to choose theirs.”The post has now gone viral again, as Washington confirms a major military operation in Venezuela that led to Maduro’s arrest and the bombing of several parts in the Latin American country.Gabbard is a veteran of the Iraq war and has long opposed US intervention overseas. She has consistently argued against deploying American troops in other countries in the past. Her views put her at odds with both Democratic and Republican administrations that supported pressure, sanctions or regime change efforts against Caracas.During the political crisis in Venezuela in 2019, when the US backed opposition leader Juan Guaidó, Gabbard warned that American involvement would worsen instability and suffering for ordinary Venezuelans.She argued that foreign interference rarely produces democratic outcomes and often leads to long-term chaos, like in Afghanistan and Iraq.Her position was opposite to President Donald Trump, who described Maduro as “illegitimate” back then and said Venezuela’s opposition-led National Assembly was “the only legitimate branch of government duly elected by the Venezuelan people”. Trump openly backed Guaidó at the time and pushed for stronger action against Maduro’s government.Indian-American Congressman Ro Khanna also criticised the Trump administration’s Venezuela policy in 2019. “The United States should not anoint the leader of the opposition in Venezuela during an internal, divided conflict.""After the latest US action in Venezuela, Tulsi did not immediately acknowledge the invasion as several political leaders did across party lines. Her silence was noticed by netizens, who called her out over her earlier position.","Gabbard is a veteran of the Iraq war and has long opposed US intervention overseas.

US President Donald Trump invited Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi to visit the United States during a phone call on Friday, Japan’s foreign ministry said.The foreign ministry added that the two leaders agreed to coordinate arrangements for a spring visit, which would be Takaichi’s first trip to the US since she took office in October. Kyodo News reported that Japanese officials have proposed late March for the visit, with the schedule possibly aligning with Washington’s annual cherry blossom festival.According to Kyodo News, the call lasted about 25 minutes and focused mainly on developments in the Indo-Pacific region. Takaichi told reporters that she and Trump confirmed the strength of the Japan-US alliance and agreed to promote a free and open Indo-Pacific, as well as cooperation among like-minded countries, including the Japan-US-South Korea partnership.However, the White House has not yet confirmed the call or the invitation, according to the AP.“At the start of the new year, I consider it extremely significant that I was able to exchange words directly with President Trump and confirm the strong partnership of the Japan-US alliance,” Takaichi was quoted as saying by Kyodo News.In its statement, Japan’s foreign ministry said the two leaders affirmed they would “carve out a new chapter in the history of the Japan-U.S.alliance” in a year when the United States marks the 250th anniversary of its independence. They also agreed to further deepen wide-ranging cooperation and friendly relations, including in the economic and security spheres.Takaichi said she conveyed her congratulations to Trump on the milestone anniversary. Kyodo News noted that Japan has pledged to gift 250 cherry trees to the United States as part of the commemorations, building on the tradition that began with Tokyo’s 1912 gift of cherry trees to Washington.The call came against the backdrop of strained regional relations between Japan and China. Beijing staged two-day military exercises in waters off Taiwan this week, AP reported. The drills followed the Trump administration’s announcement of a proposed arms sales package to Taiwan valued at more than $11 billion, which, if approved by Congress, would represent the largest such assistance to the island. China criticised the move sharply.China claims sovereignty over Taiwan and has vowed to seize the self-governed island by force if necessary. The United States is required under domestic law to provide Taiwan with sufficient defence equipment to deter any attack from the mainland.Takaichi, Japan’s first female prime minister, angered Beijing late last year when she said Chinese military action against Taiwan could justify a Japanese military response, departing from the strategic ambiguity maintained by previous leaders.Trump met Takaichi in Tokyo in October shortly after she took office and later addressed US troops aboard an aircraft carrier alongside her. After her remarks on Taiwan drew criticism from Beijing, Trump called her and described them as “extremely good friends” and that she should call him anytime, according to the Japanese leader, Kyodo News reported.","US President Donald Trump invited Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi to visit the United States during a phone call on Friday.
