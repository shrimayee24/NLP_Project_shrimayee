Yet another former pageant queen, 53-year-old Beatrice Keul claimed she was groped by Donald Trump everywhere in her body after she was invited to a suite at his New York hotel for a 'private talk'. ""I think my size saved me,"" Keul said to Daily Mail about the 1993 incident. The report said Keul is coming forward now with the allegation because she discovered all the documentation. Trump campaign's national press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Keul's accusations are false and planted to distract from the accusations against Kamala Harris' husband Doug Emhoff. ""Fake allegations like this are a disservice to women who are truly victims of assault, like the women in Doug Emhoff's past,"" Levitt said.According to the report, Keul attracted Donald Trump's attention when she won second place in the Miss Switzerland 1992 pageant in Zurich and reached the final round of the Miss Europe competition in Istanbul that year.Keul said she received an invitation from Donald Trump American Dream pageant, offering an all-expense-paid trip to New York and Atlantic city to participate in that contest. ""When you are from Switzerland, the US is a big wow. Then you think about New York, that's a second wow. And then comes the name Trump. Wow again"".""Trump, as a brand, was quite something at that time. You could be blinded by all that. I didn't know it's a jungle there.""""Ah we finally meet, Miss Keul. How nice to meet you finally,"" Keul recollected Donald Trump's first words to here where he mispronounced her name as 'cool'.""He stayed a long time. We talked for so long that everybody was staring at us. A good 10 minutes if not 15. I couldn't believe he was so fond of me,"" she said.There was a press luncheon after which Keul was asked by Trump staff to stay back and she was then taken to the upper floors. ""I thought Trump wanted to talk, as the other guy told me...when I entered, he jumped on me. I just had time to turn. I was not prepared. I tried to do what I could to get rid of him...he kissed on my lips and on the neck. He tried to lift my dress. He was grabbing and touching my body everywhere he could.""""I'm very tall, that's what helped me a lot...I think my size saved me,"" she said adding that she managed the situation by saying 'let's talk first'. And that deterred Trump who slowed down and asked her whether she wanted to drink something.After half-an-hour chat, ""he asked me to agree to see him again. I said yes, because I didn't want trouble. He asked me if I'm mad, I said no. I had to find something diplomatic,"" she said.",Beatrice Keul claims she was groped by Donald Trump at his New York hotel in 1993.

With five days left for the election as many polls are leaning towards Donald Trump, American University professor Dr Allan Lichtman , called the election Nostradamus because of his track record of perfect prediction, said he will not change his forecast that Kamala Harris will win the election. The prediction was made on September 5, before the ABC News debate and Litchman said ""nothing has changed to change my prediction"". During a livestream Tuesday, he said he's anxious, more anxious not because of the polls but primarily because he's worried about the future of this country.Litchman said he has been doing this for 42 years and every four years. Instead of butterflies, he has a flock of cows in his stomach. ""Of course I'm anxious. Not because of the polls, but primarily because I’m worried about the future of this country.”Lichtman's prediction is not based on polls but on 13 categories which he calls the ""Keys to the White House"" -- and Harris has the edge in eight of those metrics compared to Trump's three.But there is always a possibility that he could be wrong, he conceded. “But it’s always possible that something so cataclysmic and so unprecedented could change the pattern of history.”“My predictions have stood the test of time, my indicators have always been right,” he said. “The keys are very objective and quantitative.”He is a registered Democrat and recently announced that he was cancelling his Washington Post subscription after the paper decided not to endorse a candidate. “There is more election anxiety this year than I have ever seen and I go back to Kennedy-Nixon,” he reflected. “I have never seen this kind of election anxiety because a lot of people believe that the future of the country is on the line here and that democracy in this country could be a thing of the past.”This year, he said he received unprecedented hate in calling the election for Harris. “I have never experienced anything close to the hate that has been reaped upon me this time,” he told NewsNation’s Chris Cuomo.“I’ve been getting feedback that is vulgar, violent, threatening, and even beyond that, the safety and security of my family has been compromised.”",American University professor Dr Allan Lichtman says he won't change his prediction that Kamala Harris is winning the election.

Biden's 'garbage' clarification

President Joe Biden called Donald Trump's followers 'garbage' after comedian Tony Hinchcliffe at Donald Trump's Madison Square Garden event called Puerto Rico an 'island of garbage'. It was a tit-for-tat but the offensive coming from President Biden amplified the issue probably more than it deserved became one of the unforgettable moments this election as the MAGA supporters seized on the opportunity to up the ante.The White House attempted a cover-up as in the transcript, Biden's 'garbage' comment reads this: ""The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporter's."" The apostrophe could not save the day as the Harris campaign too did not take the comment well. ""Biden's comments are the latest example of why Kamala Harris ' team has been avoiding campaigning with him,"" Axios reported citing Harris aides who call Biden both ""unpopular and undisciplined"".Harris' aides were frustrated last week too when Biden went to New Hampshire and said ""we gotta lock (Trump) up"". Biden later said he only meant it politically. But this was something that Harris' team wanted to avoid. The 'garbage' row also dimmed Kamala Harris' closing argument speech Tuesday night. Biden did not appear alongside her but also ""upstaged"" Kamala Harris.Apart from White House's clarification, Biden too posted a clarification on X.

While hosting the event on the South Lawn on Wednesday evening, Biden was photographed appearing to bite at least two babies dressed in costumes, leading some critics to question his behaviour.MAGA supporters were quick to react to the viral photos and videos, with one user declaring, ""Joe Biden bit a baby during the White House Halloween celebration; I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IS GOING ON ANYMORE."" Another user commented, ""Unbelievable! This is one of the wildest Biden moments yet!"" The reactions culminated in a concerning refrain from others, urging parents to ""never let him near children.""Michael Flynn, who served as Trump's national security advisor said: Keep your kids away from this man! Laura Loomer, who was recently in the headlines for her 'curry smell' comment and a loyal Trump supporter also lashed out at Biden, saying ""They’re eating the dogs. They’re eating the babies,"" referencing Trump's rhetoric of Haitian immigrants eating dogs in Ohio, which was later discredited. Another MAGA supporter added, ""Creepy Joe Biden just bit a baby during a trick-or-treat celebration at the White House! What's wrong with this guy?.""The Bidens welcomed around 8,000 guests, including military-connected children and local students, to enjoy the festivities. The First Lady , Jill Biden, donned a giant panda costume as part of the theme ""Hallo-Read,"" designed to promote reading among young children.Earlier in the day, the First Lady read a spooky story about pumpkins to a group of excited kids, aiming to encourage a love for literature. The couple spent about an hour handing out treats, with Biden distributing White House Hershey's Kisses and Jill offering copies of “10 Spooky Pumpkins.”The event featured a vibrant display, including a large orange moon and festive decorations celebrating Halloween and literature. In a statement, the White House highlighted Jill Biden's commitment to education, with the theme designed to inspire families to read together. The decorations featured cardboard cutouts of the family cat, Willow, and stacks of books, with giant pumpkins adorning the entrance.","President Joe Biden was photographed appearing to bite at least two babies dressed in costumes.

Watch: Trump hits back at President Biden's comment by riding a garbage truck,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-trump-hits-back-at-president-bidens-comment-by-riding-a-garbage-truck/articleshow/114798799.cms,"Former President Donald Trump , known for his quick wit, climbed into a garbage truck wearing an orange safety vest to seize the opportunity to criticise President Joe Biden ’s recent remarks. The former president took the opportunity to draw attention to Biden’s comments, which likened his supporters to “garbage.”“How do you like my garbage truck?” Trump quipped, seated in a garbage truck emblazoned with “Make America Great Again” and his own name, as he answered questions from reporters. Sporting the bright safety vest over his usual white dress shirt and red tie, he added, “This is in honour of Kamala and Joe Biden.”Trump, also once again distanced himself from comedian Tony Hinchcliffe's remarks and, dismissed any need to address the Puerto Rico joke directly. “I don’t know anything about the comedian,” he said from the garbage truck. “I’ve never seen him. He’s a comedian—what can I tell you?”During the rally held shortly after this, Trump joked about his reluctance to wear the orange vest, which his team had encouraged. “I said, NO WAY!” Trump recounted. “But they said, ‘Okay, sir… but if you did, it actually makes you look thinner.’ THEY GOT ME. I said I want to wear it on stage.” The former president appeared delighted with the crowd’s response, offering reporters a final send-off: “I hope you enjoyed this garbage truck. Thank you very much.”The back-and-forth stemmed from Tony Hinchcliffe's comments who, during Trump's MSG rally, called Puerto Rico “a floating island of garbage.” The comments drew widespread criticism, particularly from Democrats, and initially placed Trump and his allies on the defensive. However, the situation took a new turn when Biden, on a Wednesday call, made a comment that “the only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.” Although Biden later clarified that he was referring to Trump’s divisive rhetoric and not to the supporters themselves, the damage had already been done.Trump capitalised on the comment, portraying it as further evidence of what he believes to be the Democrats’ low opinion of his voter base. Vice President Kamala Harris , however, quickly distanced herself from Biden’s statement, expressing disagreement with any personal attacks on voters based on political preference. “Let me be clear, I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for,” Harris stated in response to reporters’ questions during her campaign stops in North Carolina and Pennsylvania.This stunt comes as the 2024 presidential campaign intensifies, with both Trump and Biden traversing key battleground states. Harris, working to distance her campaign from Biden’s gaffe, delivered her own message in North Carolina, saying, “This is someone who is unstable, obsessed with revenge,” while leading the crowd in chants of “We are not going back!”","The former president took the opportunity to draw attention to Biden’s comments, which likened his supporters to “garbage.” The back-and-forth stemmed from comedian Tony Hinchcliffe's comments who, during Trump's MSG rally, called Puerto Rico “a floating island of garbage.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114798761,imgsize-801985,width-400,resizemode-4/114798761.jpg"

An ABC affiliate's broadcast during the Formula 1 Mexico Grand Prix mistakenly displayed election results suggestingvice president Kamala Harris has secured a pivotal lead in Pennsylvania ahead of the November 5 election. The local station, WNEP-TV , quickly clarified that the figures shown—Harris at 52% and Donald Trump at 47%—were merely test results, generating a flurry of reactions on social media.The erroneous results, which aired early Sunday evening, were not indicative of any actual vote counts, according to WNEP-TV. The station stated that the numbers were randomly generated to assist news organisations in verifying their equipment prior to the upcoming election night. “Those numbers should not have appeared on the screen, and it was an error by WNEP that they did,” the channel explained in their official statement. They said that Pennsylvania law prohibits any counting of mail-in ballots before 7:00 a.m. on Election Day, with all votes being sealed until the polls close at 8.00 p.m.Despite the clarification, conservative commentators on social media quickly seized upon the footage, igniting debates about the credibility of the election process and the potential implications for Harris's campaign. This incident comes at a crucial moment, as recent polling indicates a highly competitive landscape in Pennsylvania, a key battleground state.As of now, a CNN poll reveals that Harris and Trump are virtually tied in Pennsylvania, each garnering 48% of support among likely voters. However, the same poll shows Harris with a slight edge in neighbouring states, leading Trump by 48% to 43% in Michigan and by 51% to 45% in Wisconsin. These states are part of the critical ""blue wall,"" which played a significant role in Joe Biden's victory over Trump in the 2020 election.Interviews conducted between October 23 and 28 with a total of 726 voters in Michigan, 819 in Pennsylvania, and 736 in Wisconsin point to a highly volatile electorate as the election draws near. With a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points, the stakes remain high for both candidates as they strive to secure support in these crucial swing states.This is not the first time that ABC has stirred controversy surrounding Kamala Harris. Following the heated debate between Harris and Donald Trump, the former president and his allies, argued that the moderators displayed favoritism towards Harris.""Despite having to debate three people, Polls firmly state that I won, and EASILY. I felt that also, but no Politician should ever do a Debate with ABC News . They have proven NOT WORTHY, and hopefully an investigation will be done as to whether or not they gave the Debate questions to Comrade Kamala,"" Trump had said in September.","WNEP-TV broadcast election results showing Kamala Harris at 52% and Donald Trump at 47%.

A magnitude 6.0 earthquake was recorded off the southern coast of Oregon on Wednesday afternoon, as confirmed by the U.S. Geological Survey. The tremor, which struck approximately 170 miles from the coastal town of Bandon, was felt by over 75 residents, although no significant damage has been reported.The earthquake occurred at a depth of 6.2 miles (10 kilometres). Emergency management officials in Washington state reassured the public via social media, noting that while a quake of this magnitude near the Cascadia Subduction Zone can be alarming, this particular event originated in the Blanco Fracture Zone , where seismic activity is relatively frequent.The Cascadia Subduction Zone itself stretches 600 miles (965 kilometres) along the coast, extending from Northern California to British Columbia. Seismologists warn that this area has been building tectonic stress for over three centuries, with the potential for a major earthquake and subsequent tsunami in the future.

Former US President Donald Trump 's team is exploring the possibility of denying federal police funding to local law enforcement agencies that refuse to participate in his planned deportation efforts if re-elected, according to reports from three sources close to his campaign.This strategy could face legal opposition, similar to challenges encountered during his previous administration, according to a report from NBC News. The sources emphasised that final plans remain subject to Trump 's official announcement.When contacted, the Trump campaign provided no response to inquiries.The campaign sources expressed confidence that this approach would withstand legal scrutiny and compel Democratic-controlled jurisdictions to cooperate with mass deportation efforts.Ron Vitiello, former acting ICE director under Trump, shared insights about previous challenges, saying, ""The Justice Department was going to withhold grant money. They didn't get to enjoy, if you will, or participate in that fully.""Currently, sanctuary jurisdictions such as Chicago and California do not notify ICE about encounters with undocumented immigrants.

Commentator Ben Shapiro mocked Biden, saying, “Hey guys, good news: if ever you find yourself in trouble, just claim that a plural noun is actually a singular possessive with an apostrophe. Amazing get-out-of-jail-free trick!” Vivek Ramaswamy hailed it as the “October Surprise,” referencing the notion that a news event could influence the upcoming November election. He said, “Here's the October surprise . It just arrived. This is the basket of deplorables moment. That's what Hillary Clinton said in ’16 that tanked her campaign.” He added, “The reality is we know his family is secretly probably rooting for Donald Trump , not Kamala Harris , to win because they feel really vengeful about how they were treated.”Trump’s running mate, JD Vance , called the comments “disgusting” and accused Biden of attacking half the country. Getting in on the act, the Trump team used the line as a fundraiser, sending an email to voters saying, “You are not garbage! I love you! You are the best our nation has to offer.”Meanwhile, Joe Biden clarified, saying, “Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump's supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage—which is the only word I can think of to describe it. His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That's all I meant to say.”Democrats , meanwhile, tried to spin it by pointing out that Biden wasn’t on the ticket, which led Republicans to hit back and wonder if Tony Hinchcliffe was the Presidential candidate, with some MAGA supporters lamenting that the mainstream media had spent more time covering a comedian’s joke than two assassination attempts on Trump.However, when asked by Axios if the White House had questioned the president on what he meant, they declined to comment and would only speak off the record, which the media organisation declined.What will be more frustrating for Harris is that Biden’s remarks came precisely as she was making her closing statement. Despite being in Washington, he wasn’t seen with Harris during her final remarks, and Harris’s aides hit back by claiming that Biden is “both unpopular and undisciplined.”The fiasco during the Democrats’ closing statement highlights their struggles in this election since Harris was tapped for Biden. The Trump team has been “reverse-sea-lioning” the Harris campaign into fighting nonsensical, back-alley battles instead of focusing on major issues.This election has highlighted a shift in American communication from mainstream media to podcasts and X threads, as Jeff Bezos recently emphasised in a scathing op-ed. The latest New York Times poll of polls shows Harris leads by less than one point—a worrying margin given Democrats’ usual advantage in the popular vote. In the seven swing states, it’s virtually tied, and after three Trump election cycles, America’s media and democracy appear firmly broken.Top 10 stories:",The White House came up with the greatest excuse since “the dog ate my homework.” Joe Biden said in a video watched by millions on the internet: “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters’” The White House changed the text to: ‘The only trash I see is his supporter’s’,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114786546,imgsize-1207309,width-400,resizemode-4/114786546.jpg"

Adnan Khan stated, ""The attack happened in the morning hours as health workers were gathering ahead of leaving for the door-to-door campaign along with police, who escort polio teams for their safety.""In a separate incident on the same day, militants attacked a health center in North Waziristan. They seized guns from officers and warned health workers not to participate in the polio campaign.

Last month, several workers were killed when armed men stormed an under-construction house in Panjgur.

Pakistan begins another vaccination campaign after a worrying surge in polio cases,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-begins-another-vaccination-campaign-after-a-worrying-surge-in-polio-cases/articleshow/114682461.cms,"(AP photo)

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan began a nationwide vaccination campaign Monday to protect 45 million children from polio after a surge in new cases that has hampered years of efforts to stop the disease in one of the two countries where it has never been eradicated.Pakistan regularly launches such campaigns, but violence targeting the health workers and police assigned to escort them is common. Militants falsely claim the vaccination campaigns are a Western conspiracy to sterilize children.The campaign is the third this year and will continue until Sunday ""in response to the alarming increase in polio cases,"" said Ayesha Raza Farooq , the prime minister's adviser for the polio eradication program. ""We are re-energized in our efforts to combat polio,"" she said in a statement.During the door-to-door campaign, children younger than 5 will be vaccinated and given drops of Vitamin A supplements to enhance their immunity.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif recently met with front-line health workers, urging them to ensure no child was left unvaccinated by going door-to-door.Anwarul Haq, who is the coordinator of the National Emergency Operations Centre for Polio Eradication, also urged parents to fully cooperate with polio workers. ""Polio has no cure, but it can be prevented with this readily available vaccine,"" he said.Pakistan has recorded 41 cases across 71 districts so far this year, Farooq said. Most were reported from southwestern Balochistan and southern Sindh province, following by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and eastern Punjab province.The surge in cases in new locations is worrying authorities since previous cases were from the restive northwest bordering Afghanistan, where the Taliban government in September suddenly stopped a door-to-door vaccination campaign.Authorities in Pakistan say the Afghan Taliban's recent decision to stop door-to-door anti-polio campaign will have repercussions beyond the Afghan border, as people from both sides frequently travel to each other's country. The World Health Organization has confirmed 18 polio cases in Afghanistan this year.Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only two countries in the world where the spread of polio has never been stopped. It is one of the world's most infectious diseases, so it continues to spread anywhere people are not fully vaccinated. In severe cases, polio can cause permanent paralysis and death.","Pakistan has recorded 41 cases across 71 districts so far this year.

He stated, ""Some KP ministers are more focused on benefits than promoting the goals of the PTI.""The MNA mentioned that he had received threats of expulsion from the party but asserted that such threats would not dissuade him. He indicated his plan to meet with the PTI founder to discuss the current situation in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government. He noted that he would inform Imran about alleged misconduct by certain officials, whom he believes should face prosecution rather than be rewarded with government positions.Citing a previous incident, Marwat criticized the recent promotion of a police officer who reportedly fired at him in Bajaur. He noted that the officer has now been elevated to the position of senior superintendent of police (SSP) in Peshawar.The report further stated that the PTI leader stated that he would update Imran on grievances to confront the current situation within PTI's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa leadership. He urged for a strong strategy to aid in securing the release of the party's founder.Marwat's comments follow reports of internal conflicts within the PTI that surfaced during the D-Chowk protests earlier this month and later over the voting for the 26th Constitutional Amendment , where some party members voted in favour of changes that contradicted the party's policy.In a related development, Zain Qureshi resigned as the PTI's deputy parliamentary leader in the National Assembly a day ago after receiving a show-cause notice for severing ties with the PTI leadership during the passage of the amendment in both houses.

This has frustrated both residents and business firms in the same manner as they rely on electricity for their daily purposes.As per the Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) department, ""The power cuts took place after an order taken by the High Court related to an alleged incident involving the assault of a female prisoner at the Battagram sub-jail.""Conversely, the trade union has rejected the explanation for the power outage, labeling it as ""ridiculous."" They argue that the daytime power outages are solely to ensure a continuous electricity supply at night for the ongoing operation of CCTV cameras in the sub-jail.The union further contended that the decision to cut power constitutes an ""economic murder"" of local traders, who have been unable to conduct business for over a week. Consequently, the union is urging immediate action to restore power supply in the area, aiming to safeguard the economic interests of both residents and business operators.","Residents of Karachi have been experiencing severe and unusual load-shedding, leading to power outages during the daytime.

Eight people were killed, and five others sustained injuries on Saturday when a suicide bomber triggered an explosion at a checkpoint near Mir Ali, a town situated in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, close to the Afghan border .The attacker detonated the bomb while riding on the back of a motorbike rickshaw, according to an unnamed local police officer who spoke to AFP.The casualties included four police officers, two members of a state paramilitary force and two civilians. The police officer further stated that among the five wounded, three are in critical condition and have been moved to a nearby military hospital for treatment.An unnamed local government official corroborated to AFP the reported number of fatalities and injuries resulting from the attack.This comes a day after ten police officers were killed in an attack on a check post near the Afghan border.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan authorities Thursday released Bushra Bibi , wife of jailed former PM Imran Khan , from prison in Rawalpindi, a day after Islamabad high court granted her bail in an alleged graft case involving purchase and sale of state gifts.Bibi, 50, was arrested on January 31. She and her husband were convicted of corruption and illegal marriage just ahead of the Feb 8 polls in Pakistan. The Islamabad-based accountability court had sentenced the couple to 14 years in jail in what is known as the “toshakhana” (state repository) case.The case over allegations of illegal marriage had collapsed on appeal and Bibi’s graft sentence was suspended in July, allowing her to walk free from Adiala Jail where Imran remains imprisoned.She was, however, arrested again in a fresh graft case. In the new case, dubbed as “Toshakhana 2,” the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) had accused the couple of retaining an expensive Bvlgari jewellery set gifted by a foreign leader at a low price, causing a significant loss to the national exchequer. The gift set included a necklace, earrings, bracelets, and rings.A day earlier, HC judge Miangul Hasan Aurangzeb approved Bushra’s bail in the case, following which a special court issued her release orders, ending nearly nine months of her detention. Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) hailed her release, with slogans of “welcome back Bushra Bibi.”“You have faced extremely difficult times, disgusting campaigns and character assassination attempts against you during your illegal time in jail. The Pakistani nation salutes your bravery,” PTI said in a post on X, confirming that Bibi had reached her Bani Gala residence in the federal capital.Meanwhile, the Islamabad HC on Thursday also ordered the jail administration to produce Imran by 3pm in court to facilitate his meeting with his lawyers. “I know you won’t implement my orders, but let me issue directions,” Justice Ijaz Ishaq Khan remarked during the hearing. The judge later softened his stance after jail authorities assured him that they would arrange Imran’s meeting with his counsels in prison.Imran and his party have been at crosshairs of an ongoing tussle between the executive and the judiciary, with the latter accusing the country’s powerful military and intelligence agencies of exerting pressure to secure favourable verdicts in political cases, particularly those involving the PTI chief.Imran has not physically appeared in a court since Aug last year, with all hearings being held in the high-security Rawalpindi prison.","Bushra Bibi, 50, was arrested on January 31.

While the police dismiss the reports as "" fake news "" designed to incite unrest, protesting students see them as a rare opportunity to publicly address the issue of sexual assault.Despite the conflicting narratives, both sides acknowledge that the case has exposed legitimate concerns. Khadija Shabbir, a 21-year-old protester in Lahore , asserts that girls on campuses feel threatened. Syeda Shehrbano Naqvi, the senior officer investigating the case, admits that harassment is an extremely sensitive subject that most women in Pakistan have experienced to some degree.The controversy began with social media posts claiming that a staff member had raped a woman in the basement of a Punjab College campus in Lahore. When authorities were unable to identify a victim, they dismissed the claims as a hoax. However, student protests erupted, leading to arrests and the closure of educational institutes across Punjab province.Students, who have been banned from officially organizing in unions for the past four decades, continue to protest, driven by a deep-rooted frustration with the lack of trust in authorities to take the matter of harassment seriously. Many protesters cite personal experiences of harassment as their primary motivation for participating in the movement.The Lahore High Court has announced a new committee of judges to investigate campus sexual harassment , indicating that authorities are acknowledging the validity of the protests. However, the confrontation between students and police is taking place amidst a broader crackdown on dissent in Pakistan, with student social media pages and online chat groups disappearing and officials pledging to prosecute those spreading misinformation.As the protests continue, women who have shared their experiences with harassment find themselves sidelined as the demonstrations sometimes turn violent, often led by men. Despite this, young female students remain determined to stand up for their rights and fight against sexual harassment on college campuses.","The controversy began with social media posts claiming that a staff member had raped a woman in the basement of a Punjab College campus in Lahore.
