IMPHAL: A Meitei man visiting his Kuki fiancee in Manipur's hill district of Churachandpur was abducted and shot dead on camera Wednesday evening, a killing that jolted the state with graphic footage, street protests and an order for an NIA probe.M Rishikanta, 31, was allegedly dragged away by armed miscreants from his fiancee's home at Tuibong village in Churachandpur district southwest of Imphal around 6.30pm. Police said his body was found hours later near Natjang village in the same district. A case has been registered and search operations launched.Rishikanta worked as a technical engineer in Nepal, family members said. He had arrived before Christmas and had been staying in Churachandpur since Dec 19. The couple had sought permission from Kuki National Organisation, an umbrella group of Kuki insurgent outfits, for his stay. KNO denied knowledge of the visit and any role in the killing.A video circulated widely on social media showed his final moments, with the gunmen shooting him twice despite his pleas. The clip carried a message reading: ""No Peace, No Popular Government.""An autopsy was conducted Thursday in Churachandpur.Family members identified the body over a video call, unable to travel to the hill district amid security concerns. Kakching police facilitated the process, and the body was to be handed over later in the day.Manipur has remained deeply fractured since ethnic violence erupted in May 2023 between Meiteis and Kuki-Zo tribal communities, leaving communities effectively sealed off from one another. Even now, civilians rarely cross into areas identified with rival groups. Periodic flare-ups such as the one in Churachandpur keep the state on edge.Protests erupted Thursday at Kakching Khunou, Rishikanta's native village in Kakching district, where residents blocked an arterial road. To douse tensions, Governor AK Bhalla told a delegation of a Joint Action Committee led by Lok Sabha MP Angomcha Bimol Akoijam that the case would be handed to NIA for a ""thorough and impartial"" inquiry, according to an official release.The governor further said that intensive combing operations were under way ""on a war footing"", with coordinated deployment of state and central forces to track those responsible.JAC urged steps to prevent similar killings, called for intensified action against armed Kuki militants in the hills, and sought disciplinary action against Churachandpur's police chief and central forces deployed there, alleging failure to take preventive measures.","M Rishikanta, 31, was allegedly dragged away by armed miscreants.

How the incident unfolded

What police say

Airport response







BENGALURU: A South Korean businesswoman has accused an airline ground-handling employee of sexually assaulting her at Bengaluru’s Kempegowda International Airport, allegedly under the pretext of “manual frisking”.The 32-year-old woman was returning to South Korea on Monday when the incident occurred in the international departures area of Terminal 2, shortly after she had cleared immigration and security checks.According to the woman’s complaint, the incident took place around 10.45am.A man approached her after she had completed Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) frisking and immigration formalities, identified himself as airport staff and asked to see her boarding pass.He then claimed there was a problem with her checked-in baggage, saying a beeping sound had been detected and that resolving the issue would take time.He allegedly suggested an alternative — what he described as “manual frisking” — and asked her to accompany him.Police said the woman was taken to an area near the men’s washroom. There, under the guise of inspection, the man allegedly touched her chest multiple times, asked her to turn around and then touched her private parts.When the woman objected, he allegedly hugged her, thanked her and told her she could leave.The Kempegowda International Airport police said the accused has been identified as Mohammed Affaann Ahmed, 25, a ground-handling staff member.Police said he had no authority to physically inspect passengers.According to investigators, the woman later reported the incident to airport security staff, who immediately detained the accused and alerted airport police. CCTV footage from the terminal is said to corroborate key aspects of her account.A case has been registered against Ahmed under Section 75 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), which deals with sexual harassment. He was arrested and remanded to judicial custody, and has been lodged in Central Jail at Parappana Agrahara.Airport authorities said frisking and physical checks are conducted only by authorised CISF personnel and in the case of female passengers, by female staff.AISATS spokesperson said, ""An unpardonable incident was reported at Kempegowda International Airport, Bengaluru. The employee involved was immediately terminated and handed over to the authorities for further legal action. We deeply regret the emotional distress caused by the incident and have extended all necessary support to the guest. A comprehensive inquiry is underway to strengthen safeguards and prevent any recurrence. AISATS is fully cooperating with the authorities and remains committed to the highest standards of ethics, safety, and compliance.""They said any airport employee who suspects an issue with a passenger or baggage is required to alert CISF or immigration officials and has no right to carry out physical checks.Police said the investigation is ongoing.","A South Korean woman has accused an airline ground-handling employee of sexually assaulting her at Bengaluru’s Kempegowda International Airport.

"10 soldiers killed, 11 injured as armoured carrier skids off mountain road in Jammu & Kashmir’s Doda",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/10-soldiers-killed-11-injured-as-armoured-carrier-skids-off-mountain-road-in-jammu-kashmirs-doda/articleshow/127185916.cms,"Representative image (ANI)

JAMMU: Ten Army soldiers were killed and 11 wounded around noon Thursday when an armoured troop carrier skidded off a narrow mountain road in J&K and plunged nearly 200ft into a gorge. The six-wheel truck was heading to a counterterrorism operation in the upper reaches of Doda district, a remote, forested area in the Jammu region, when it lost traction near Khanni Top — a 9,000ft-high pass on Bhaderwah–Chamba interstate road that links J&K with Himachal Pradesh.An Army-police joint rescue effort began immediately after the crash, which occurred in bad weather on a steep stretch of road carved into the mountains. “The vehicle carrying troops for an operation slipped off the road while navigating treacherous terrain in bad weather,” White Knight Corps said in a post on X.Four soldiers died at the crash site. Others died of injuries while being evacuated or after reaching hospital, officials said. At least 10 of the injured were airlifted to the Army’s Northern Command Hospital in Udhampur. One injured soldier remains under observation at a sub-district hospital in Bhaderwah town, about 190km northeast of Jammu city, and is reported to be stable.The troops were traveling in a bulletproof Casspir — also known as Casper — a mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicle designed to shield soldiers from land mines and roadside bombs.PM Narendra Modi, defence minister Rajnath Singh, Lt governor Manoj Sinha, CM Omar Abdullah and Northern Command GoC-in-C Lt Gen Pratik Sharma expressed grief and condolences to the families of the dead, and wished a speedy recovery to the injured.“Deeply anguished by the mishap in Doda, in which we have lost our brave army personnel. Their service to the nation will be remembered forever. May the injured recover at the earliest. All possible support is being provided to those affected,” Modi posted on X.The crash adds to a series of fatal accidents involving military vehicles in the mountainous terrain of J&K and Ladakh, where narrow roads, sharp bends and frequent landslides pose constant risks. Thursday’s accident took the toll to 30 since 2023.In July 2025, a Lt Col and a soldier were killed when a boulder struck a convoy vehicle in eastern Ladakh. In Jan last year, four soldiers died after their truck rolled down a hillside in Bandipora district of north Kashmir. Five soldiers were killed in Dec 2024 when a truck plunged into a gorge in Poonch district near the LoC. In Aug 2023, nine soldiers died in a similar crash in the Nyoma area of Ladakh when their vehicle skidded off a mountain road and fell into a deep gorge.",Troop carrier skidded off a narrow mountain road in J&K and plunged nearly 200ft into a gorge.

Don't air internal issues in public: Congress warns Punjab leaders; no 'group activity' to be tolerated,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dont-air-internal-issues-in-public-congress-warns-punjab-leaders-no-group-activity-to-be-tolerated/articleshow/127182144.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Congress on Thursday issued a stern warning to its Punjab leaders, asking them to stop airing internal differences in public or fuelling factionalism. The party asked them to instead work together to ensure Congress return to power in the upcoming 2027 assembly elections.The order came during a three-hour meeting convened by Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge at his residence in New Delhi, which was also attended by Rahul Gandhi, amid reports of infighting within the state unit, news agency PTI reported.Punjab goes to the polls in early 2027, and Congress is aiming to reclaim the state from the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).Party leaders were asked to refrain from making statements against one another and were assured that there would be no immediate change in the state leadership. The high command, they were informed, would take decisions on candidate selection and campaign strategy in due course.AICC general secretary (organisation) KC Venugopal said Kharge and Gandhi reviewed the political situation in Punjab and heard the views of state leaders, describing the discussions as ""very fruitful"".“The party has directed all leaders to refrain from making public statements on internal matters.Everyone may have their own views, but these should be raised only within party forums. Going to the media or spreading such issues on social media will not be tolerated,” Venugopal told reporters.He said the leadership had given a “very clear direction” and that all leaders present had unanimously agreed to it. On speculation about a leadership change in Punjab, Venugopal said there was “no question of it at present”.Addressing concerns raised by some leaders over representation of weaker sections, Venugopal said the Congress remained committed to ensuring adequate representation of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, OBCs and economically weaker sections, including in Punjab. However, he stressed that such issues must be raised internally.“We have told the state leadership not to make statements in public. From tomorrow onwards, you will see the Congress united. We will fight the elections together and win Punjab,” he said.On reports of some leaders writing jointly to Rahul Gandhi seeking a separate discussion, Venugopal said individual requests were acceptable but “group activities” would not be tolerated. “If anyone wants to meet Rahul ji, they can write individually,” he said, adding that Kharge and Gandhi were planning a visit to Punjab soon.","The order came during a three-hour meeting convened by Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge at his residence in New Delhi.

'To Remove Corrupt DMK': TTV Dhinakaran Meets Goyal As AMMK Rejoins NDA Ahead Of Tamil Nadu Polls

Tamil Nadu governor's walkout

Karnataka governor's walkout

Kerala governor cuts short address

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin on Thursday said his party DMK would consult like-minded opposition parties to move a constitutional amendment to end the practice of the governor’s address at the start of the first assembly session.This comes after a series of confrontations in Opposition-ruled states where governors refused to read state government-approved speeches.Reacting to recent walkouts and curtailed addresses in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka, Stalin accused governors of acting like “party agents” and undermining elected governments. In a post on X, he said the pattern was “clear and deliberate” and argued that abolishing the Governor’s address was now the only solution.“First Tamil Nadu. Then Kerala. Now Karnataka. The pattern is clear and deliberate. Governors refusing to read the speech prepared by state governments and behaving like party agents, undermining duly elected state governments,” Stalin wrote.He added, “As I stated earlier, the only solution now is to end the practice of commencing the first annual Assembly session with the Governor’s address. DMK will consult like-minded opposition parties across India and pursue a constitutional amendment in the very next parliamentary session to abolish this obsolete and irrelevant practice.”Stalin’s remarks come two days after Tamil Nadu governor RN Ravi walked out of the Assembly before delivering his inaugural address, alleging disrespect to the national anthem and claiming his microphone was switched off.The episode led to sharp exchanges inside the House, with Speaker M Appavu urging the governor to follow established Assembly conventions.Raj Bhavan later issued a statement defending the walkout and alleging that issues such as atrocities against Dalits and sexual violence against Dalit women were omitted from the government’s speech. Opposition AIADMK leaders also staged a walkout over law and order issues.A similar standoff unfolded in Karnataka today, when Governor Thawarchand Gehlot delivered only two lines of his customary address and walked out of the joint sitting of the Assembly and Council, refusing to read the full Cabinet-approved speech.The shortened address triggered chaos in the House, with Congress members raising slogans and accusing the governor of violating constitutional norms.Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah said the governor’s conduct amounted to a breach of the Constitution and that the government was considering legal options.Explaining the government’s stand, Siddaramaiah said the address prepared by the Cabinet had included objections to the Union government’s decision to replace MGNREGA with the Viksit Bharat–Rozgar aur Ajeevika Mission (Rural), a move his government strongly opposes.In a detailed statement on X, Siddaramaiah said, “By not reading the address prepared by the Cabinet at the first joint session of the year, the Hon’ble Governor of Karnataka has violated the Constitution. This act amounts to an affront to the House of elected representatives.”He added that under Articles 176 and 163, the governor is bound to read the address prepared by the Council of Ministers and has no authority to substitute it with a speech of his own.The Karnataka CM also linked the confrontation to substantive policy differences, particularly over rural employment. He said the new law replacing MGNREGA diluted guaranteed employment, removed decentralised decision-making powers of gram sabhas and panchayats, and disproportionately affected women, Dalits, workers and small farmers.“By refusing to read the Cabinet-prepared address, the Governor has violated constitutional provisions and insulted the Legislature,” Siddaramaiah said, adding that the Congress government, along with legislators, would protest the move and examine legal remedies, including approaching the Supreme Court.In Kerala, Governor Arif Mohammed Khan drastically curtailed his customary policy address to the Assembly at the start of the Budget session, delivering what became the shortest such speech in the House’s history. The address lasted just one minute and 18 seconds, with the governor reading only the first line and the concluding paragraph of the original 62-page speech.By doing so, Khan technically fulfilled his constitutional obligation, but his action raised serious questions over whether differences with the elected government should extend to the Assembly, which represents the will of the entire state. The entire exercise, including the national anthem, concluded in under five minutes, after which the governor left the House.The back-to-back confrontations have reignited a wider debate on the limits of administrative discretion. Constitutional experts have warned that refusing to deliver a Cabinet-approved address could invite judicial scrutiny, observing that while governors may express reservations, the Constitution mandates that the address be delivered to the House.","Stalin accuses governors of acting like ‘party agents’ and undermining elected governments.

'Where Were Your Ancestors?' Gogoi Mocks BJP, Blasts Modi's Nehru Remark During Vande Mataram Debate

On Gaurav Gogoi and national security

Vision for Assam’s growth

Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Thursday that he was a ""victim"" of an alleged rift between Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi during his time in Congress party Speaking to NDTV, Sarma, who spent 22 years in the Congress before joining the BJP , said ""Rahul doesn't want Priyanka in Kerala. I was in Congress for 22 years. I also have some inner information. He doesn't want to disturb KC Venugopal and his axis, and Priyanka is an outsider to that axis. That's why he transferred her to Assam. An MP from Kerala has not been assigned responsibility in Kerala. How else do you interpret this?"" he added.Taking a swipe at the Gandhi family, Biswa called them the ""world's biggest flop family"" and added, ""I think my family is better than theirs. We grew up struggling.""The CM denied any personal rivalry with Assam Congress president Gaurav Gogoi, saying it was his duty to alert the central government about links to what he called an ""enemy country"". He reiterated accusations against Gogoi and his wife of having connections with the Pakistani intelligence agency ISI.""But when the link is to an enemy country, and I do not forward it to the Government of India, then as a chief minister, I will be doing a disservice to the Constitution and people. Pakistan is an enemy country and a hostile neighbour. Links with Pakistan cannot be compared with a corruption charge,"" Sarma said. Quoting the Hindi spy thriller Dhurandhar, he added, “If you catch a spy, will you not expose him?”Sarma also voiced apprehensions over changing relations with Bangladesh, crediting former PM Sheikh Hasina’s regime for assisting Assam in tackling extremism.He warned that any hostility from Dhaka could allow militants to establish a base across the 800 km border.On economic matters, Sarma outlined his vision to transform Assam beyond hydrocarbon industries, eyeing opportunities in the semiconductor sector. ""India is a diverse country. We must take care of every state. If one part becomes developed only to cater to the global ecosystem, and there's nothing on the other side, then the country will collapse,"" he said. He described Assam as “landlocked and tucked away near the border” but “one of the fastest-growing big states”.Touching upon identity and demographic concerns ahead of state elections, he said, ""In Assam, we need development. For us, national security and the identity of the Assamese people are paramount. The demographic change is a huge concern. We are fighting for both our identity and development.""Sarma also took a dig at West Bengal, claiming Assam remains a relatively peaceful state, “with no fear of stones being thrown.”","Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said he was a ""victim"" of an alleged rift between Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi during his time in Congress party.

Owaisi Calls SIR a ‘Backdoor NRC’ in Lok Sabha, Warns of Selective Religious Disenfranchisement

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday pointed out to Election Commission that its SIR order did not clearly state that the exercise was also about illegal immigration, an assertion that was accepted by EC's counsel, who said there was no express mention of the same in the order.A bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi said the SIR order did not state categorically that verification of citizenship was one of the reasons for conducting the exercise. Responding to the court's query, senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi said, ""It is not mentioned expressly.""Continuing with his submission, Dwivedi said that EC's special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls was a fair, just and transparent exercise. The drive cannot be said to be manifestly arbitrary, he held and questioned the motive of petitioners who had moved the apex court against the commission.""None of the 66 lakh persons whose names were deleted in Bihar SIR came to this court or high court or filed pleas with Election Commission. A roving and fishing inquiry cannot be permitted at the instance of ADR (Association for Democratic Reforms) and PUCL (People's Union for Civil Liberties) and a few parliamentarians,"" the senior advocate said.American notions of ""due process"" could not be imported into Indian constitutional law as contended by the petitioners, he said, adding that the US itself was not following due process.""US court judgments have been cited... Where is the US following due procedure of law? President (Donald) Trump can just pick up the president of Venezuela for trial. Where is the due process, and now he wants Greenland also. Here, the petitioners want to import that,"" he said.Emphasising transparency, Dwivedi said booth level agents conducted house-to-ho-use verification, over 5 crore SMS alerts were sent to voters and the process strictly followed procedural safeguards.On Wednesday, the bench had said EC could not have ""untrammelled"" power to conduct SIR of electoral rolls and the exercise must be subject to guidelines and procedures, including transparency and principles of natural justice.Pointing out that revision of electoral rolls could have serious civil consequences for individuals whose names were not included in the voters list, the CJI said, ""If something affects the civil rights of people, why should the process followed not be in accordance with sub-section (2)?"" The CJI was referring to Section 21 of the 1950 Act that governs preparation and revision of electoral rolls.",Supreme Court points out to Election Commission that its SIR order did not clearly state that the exercise was also about illegal immigration.

Op Trashi-I Day 5: Gunfight erupts in Singhpora; searches continue,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/op-trashi-i-day-5-gunfight-erupts-in-singhpora-searches-continue/articleshow/127184215.cms,"ANI file photo

JAMMU: An intense gun battle broke out Thursday between security forces and holed-up terrorists in the dense forests of Singhpora in Chatroo belt, in the upper reaches of J&K’s Kishtwar district, even as searches continued on the fifth day of Operation Trashi-I.After a three-day lull, fresh contact was established with terrorists — believed to be three to four in number — on the run since Sunday’s encounter in Sonnar village near the LoC, in which a soldier was killed and seven more were injured. Heavy fire was exchanged between both sides before the ultras managed to escape further into the woods, officials said.Meanwhile, a cordon-and-search operation was launched in the border area of Akhnoor in Jammu district on Thursday morning, following the alleged sighting of terror suspects in Sumah locality the night before.Earlier on Wednesday, searches under Operation Trashi-I were intensified in Sonnar, Mandral-Singhpora, and adjoining areas in Chatroo, even as additional forces were rushed to the operation site to fortify the cordon and block possible escape routes. Amid increased vigil ahead of Republic Day, joint teams of security forces conducted door-to-door searches in localities with a high concentration of Burmese (Rohingyas) and Bangladesh nationals in Bhatindi-Narwal-Rajiv Nagar areas on the outskirts of Jammu, as well as in Rajouri, Poonch, Samba, Kathua, Udhampur and Doda districts as a precautionary measure.On Tuesday, the cordon was strengthened with the help of aerial surveillance and sniffer dogs, following which, the troops busted a well-concealed terrorist hideout and recovered large quantities of rations, utensils, and consumables. Three-four locals from Sonnar village were detained for questioning, as officials suspected that running such a setup would not have been possible without local help from overground workers.Army Special Forces Commando, Havildar Gajendra Singh, who succumbed Monday, was the first security personnel to die in a counter-terrorism operation in the Union Territory in 2026. Operation Trashi-I is the third this year in Jammu division, following clashes earlier this month in Kahog and Najote forests of Billawar in Kathua, south of Pir Panjal range.Kishtwar, a remote district east of the Chenab and south of Kashmir Valley, saw intensified counter-terrorism efforts in 2025 as forces tracked Pakistan-based terrorists through steep terrain and thick forests. At least six gun battles were reported there over seven months. On May 22, an Army trooper was killed and two others wounded in Chatroo. Weeks earlier, three Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists were shot dead in the same area.Security officials said Kishtwar sits astride a traditional infiltration corridor, with terrorists crossing from Pakistan via Kathua and moving through Udhampur and Doda before heading towards Kashmir valley, using forest cover to evade detection.",Heavy fire was exchanged between both sides before the ultras managed to escape further into the woods.

“I Too Want to Help Develop an India Where We Listen…” Rahul Gandhi During Student Interaction

New Delhi: Recalling how the “united resistance” mounted by farmer led protests forced the Central govt to roll back the three farm laws, leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi on Thursday called out to MGNREGA workers to take the path shown by the farmers by putting up a united fight to demand the withdrawal of the new law - Viksit Bharat - Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Act.Referring to the BJP and the Central govt, Gandhi said, “Here is the only way to stop them, workers have been shown the way by farmers. I know these people, they are cowards. If we all stand together, they will be forced to restore MGNREGA,” he said, citing the example of farm laws. He was speaking at the 'MGNREGA workers convention' organised by the opposition party at Jawahar Bhawan in Delhi that brought together workers and activists from various states.Gandhi alleged the idea of BJP behind the new law that replaced MGNREGA was to dismantle “the “guaranteed right to work and right to demand work” and enable “centralisation” where the “Central government will decide where the money will be allocated, and naturally, the BJP-ruled states will get more and the Opposition-ruled states less”.“These people want to take India back to pre-independence days where one King used to decide everything,” he alleged.At the meet, Gandhi along with Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge and other senior leaders stood in solidarity with workers who shared their concerns and fears about the new law and raised slogans. Adorning the traditional labourer's 'gamchha' on their head and holding spades on their shoulders, Kharge and Gandhi also posed with workers who in a symbolic gesture brought soil from their respective MGNREGA worksites and added it to tree saplings in what was seen to convey a message of unity and collective struggle.The Congress plans to build on the message by reaching out to gram sabhas and hold larger outreach programmes under its ongoing ‘MGNREGA Bachao Sangram”.Kharge alleged that the dismantling of MGNREGA by the Modi govt was part of a “conspiracy to erase Mahatma Gandhi’s name from public memory”and an attempt to turn the oppressed and downtrodden people of the country into “bonded labourers”. He said the party will raise the issue during the upcoming Budget session of Parliament.Gandhi claimed that scrapping of MGNREGA amounted to an attack on the Constitution, the same way the Modi govt had attacked it by bringing in “three black farm laws, demonetisation and the flawed implementation of the GST” and this new law now. “What is the name of this new law ....I don't know,"" Gandhi said. In response some in the audience spoke out saying “VB-G RAM G”.",Gandhi was speaking at the 'MGNREGA workers convention' organised by the opposition party at Jawahar Bhawan in Delhi.

NGT Acts On Noida Techie Drowning, Points To Serious Environmental Lapses

NEW DELHI: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Thursday took suo motu cognisance of the death of a 27-year-old software engineer who drowned after his SUV fell into a waterlogged trench at a commercial site in Greater Noida. The tribunal observed that the incident indicates serious environmental violations and regulatory lapses.The tribunal also highlighted that the land where the accident occurred had originally been allotted for a private mall project but, over the years, had turned into a pond due to unchecked accumulation of rainwater and discharge of wastewater from nearby housing societies, news agency ANI reported.Taking note of a media report on the incident, the NGT said that the transformation of the commercial plot into a waterbody raised questions over land-use violations, environmental degradation and the failure of authorities to prevent hazardous conditions at the site.The case relates to the death of Yuvraj Mehta, a software engineer and resident of Sector 150, Greater Noida, whose car plunged into a nearly 30-foot-deep, water-filled pit near ATS Le Grandiose in the early hours of January 17 amid dense fog and poor visibility.According to the post-mortem report, Mehta died due to asphyxiation and cardiac failure. Trapped in the icy water, he struggled to survive for nearly 90 minutes.He managed to climb onto the roof of his sinking vehicle, flashed his mobile phone’s torch repeatedly and called his father in a desperate attempt to seek help.Rescue operations involving the police, fire brigade, SDRF and NDRF were launched but were severely hampered by near-zero visibility, deep water and inadequate equipment. A delivery worker who reached the spot jumped into the trench in an attempt to save Mehta but was unable to locate him. His body was recovered around 4.30 am.An FIR has been registered against the builders responsible for the open pit, citing serious negligence, including the absence of barricading, fencing and reflectors at the accident-prone turn. Show-cause notices have also been issued to officials responsible for traffic management in the area.In a significant development, the director of Wiztown Planners, Abhay Kumar, was arrested on Tuesday. Police said the commercial plot where the trench existed was in the possession of the company. Kumar has been booked under sections related to culpable homicide not amounting to murder, causing death by negligence, and acts endangering human life.Following public outrage and protests by residents, the Uttar Pradesh government constituted a special investigation team (SIT) to probe the incident. The Noida Authority’s CEO was removed, and inspections of construction-site safety measures were ordered.The SIT has begun recording statements of officials, developers and eyewitnesses and is examining the role of civic agencies, road safety arrangements and compliance with construction and environmental norms.Residents have alleged that repeated warnings about the dangerous condition of the site were ignored. Barricades were installed only after protests and a candle march demanding justice for Mehta.","The tribunal observed that the incident indicates serious environmental violations and regulatory lapses.

'MGNREGA Bachao Abhiyan': Congress Announces Nationwide Protest Against VB-G RAM G Act

NEW DELHI: Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi on Thursday urged poor people to unite against the central government's new VB-G RAM G Act that has replaced the UPA-era MGNREGA, claiming that the Modi government's objectives behind the new legislation is same as they were with the “three black farm laws”.Addressing the National MGNREGA Workers’ Convention organised by the Rachnatmak Congress, Rahul Gandhi said PM Modi wants to finish the concept of Panchayati Raj and alleged that the ruling BJP wants an India ""where the King decides everything"".“The thinking was to provide work to those who need it. This scheme was to be run through the third tier of government – Panchayati Raj. The word rights was important. All poor people had the right to work under MGNREGA and PM Modi-BJP wants to finish that concept,” Rahul Gandhi was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Some years ago they brought in the “three black farm laws” but farmers stopped that after “all of us unitedly put pressure” on the government, the former Congress chief said.“We all put pressure and got the laws repealed. They are doing the same thing with workers that they did with farmers as they brought the three black farm laws,” Gandhi said.With the new law, the Centre will decide the work and allocation of funds with BJP-ruled governments always getting precedence, he said.Earlier, what workers used to get will be given to contractors and bureaucracy, Gandhi alleged.“They (BJP) want assets to be in a few hands so that the poor people are dependent on Adani-Ambani, that is their model of India,” he charged. They want an India where the King decides everything, he said. Gandhi also said he was unable to remember the name of the new law and asked the audience what it was.Workers from across the country participated in the convention, bringing a fistful of soil from their work sites that was put in plants as a symbolic gesture in the presence of Gandhi and Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge.The Congress launched 'MGNREGA Bachao Sangram', a 45-day nationwide campaign against the repeal of the UPA-era Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), on January 10.The opposition party is demanding the withdrawal of the Viksit Bharat - Guarantee for Rozgar Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) (VB-G RAM G) Act and restoration of MGNREGA as a rights-based law in its original form, the right to work and the authority of panchayats.","Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi urges poor people to unite against the central government's new VB-G RAM G Act.

The man, who reportedly belonged to the Meitei community, was captured by the suspected Kuki militant when he was visiting his wife, who belongs to the Kuki community.The video shows a man kneeling on his knees with his hands folded in the dark as flash light focuses on him, presumably asking to be spared. The video, which has no sound, later goes on to show the man being shot point-blank. It has ""no peace, no popular government"" captioned on it.According to the police, Mayanglambam Rishikanta Singh was abducted from his home in the Tuibong area on Wednesday and later found shot dead near Natjang village.Singh belonged to Kakching Khunou in Kakching district. He was married to his Kuki wife Chingnu Haokip of Churachandpur, and had also assumed a tribal name, Ginminthang.He had been in Nepal for work and had returned to Churachandpur on January 19, news agency PTI reported.The couple was abducted by the militant group from their homes and was taken to the secluded space of Natjang in the Henglep police station area. Rishikant Singh was then shot dead, and his wife was later set free, the police said.His body was recovered by the authorities after they received a call.The kidnappers are suspected to be from the United Kuki National Army (UNKA).The militant group is not a signatory to the SoO agreement, a deal signed between the Centre, the Manipur government and dozens of Kuki-Zo militant groups. The agreement requires cadres to stay in designated camps, surrender weapons, and undergo biometric verification while restricting their activities.After the violence surged in Manipur, the two communities do not venture into each other's areas. However, the wife claimed that she had taken permission from the local groups for her husband to stay with her.Over 260 people have lost their lives since the violence broke out in May 2023, and thousands have been left homeless amid the violence.","A man was brutally shot dead on camera in the Churachandpur district of Manipur.

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi Wednesday emphasised the need to continue working with renewed vigour in order to strengthen development trajectory in ethnic strife-hit Manipur, conveying to the state administration the Centre’s “full and steadfast” support.On the statehood day of Manipur, Tripura and Meghalaya, he wrote separate letters to their respective heads of govt, highlighting Centre’s efforts to speed up progress in the region where development had “stagnated”.In his letter to Manipur governor Ajay Kumar Bhalla, Modi recalled his visit to the state in Sept last year. “I reaffirmed our unwavering commitment to stand with the people of Manipur and to support every effort aimed at ensuring lasting peace and sustained progress,” he said.The visit was seen as part of Centre’s multi-pronged push to defuse ethnic tensions involving Meiteis and Kukis and restore normalcy in the state.He told Bhalla, “I salute my sisters and brothers of Manipur for their remarkable courage and unwavering faith in peace and progress. It is imperative that we continue to work with renewed vigour to strengthen Manipur’s development trajectory.

'Bibi, Stop Taking Credit': Trump Humiliates Israeli PM At Davos; Calls Out Israeli Iron Dome 'Lie'

US President Donald Trump on Thursday said the United States is set to receive around $600 billion in tariff revenue, adding that the figure is expected to be “much more than that” next year.Trump made the remarks while addressing the World Economic Forum (WEF) Summit in Davos, where he also highlighted what he described as an unprecedented surge in investments flowing into the country.Linking the rise in investment to the November 5 election outcome, Trump said it had brought clarity about his administration’s tariff policy. “We're doing numbers in terms of people investing in the United States as we've never had before,” he said, adding that tariffs were aimed at protecting the country, which he claimed had been taken advantage of for years.Trump noted that the estimated $600 billion in tariff revenue does not include investments by countries and companies setting up operations in the US. “We'll have, I'd say, $600 billion worth of tariff money coming in. And I think we're going to have maybe more than that.

How Jairzinho Rozenstruik 's biting incident escalated



Domestic dispute lands Heavyweight in prison

According to a recent report, former UFC heavyweight Jairzinho ""Bigi Boy"" Rozenstruik was arrested in Pembroke Pines, Florida, following a domestic violence incident involving his wife. The arrest report, released by the Pembroke Pines Police Department, contains the details regarding the physical altercation, including an allegation that the fighter bit his wife on the arm.According to police records, the altercation began while the couple was driving from a storage unit. The victim told officers that an argument escalated after she ignored Rozenstruik, prompting him to slap her hand and knock her cellphone to the floor. The arrest took place on January 19, 2026.The incident involving former UFC heavyweight Jairzinho Rozenstruik and his wife took a bizarre and violent turn on January 19. Things worsened even more when they arrived at a Bank of America. According to the police report, Rozenstruik allegedly grabbed his wife's arm to keep her from exiting the vehicle. Their argument escalated, and the former champion attempted to kiss his wife.When she refused and called him a ""nasty beast,"" he reportedly became enraged and bit her on her right bicep.The couple later stopped at Club Fit Plaza, where Rozenstruik allegedly again prevented her from leaving the car. In self-defense, the victim reportedly punched him in the face to escape. The 37-year-old was later booked into the Broward County Main Jail on several charges, including a third-degree felony (bond set at $2,500) and a misdemeanor (bond set at $1,000). Due to his status as a Surinamese national, an immigration hold was placed on him, which can complicate his release, even if bail is posted.Jairzinho Rozenstruik was a longtime fixture in the UFC's heavyweight top 10, known for his elite kickboxing and knockout power. However, his tenure with the promotion ended in 2025. At the time of his arrest, he was the reigning heavyweight champion for the Dirty Boxing promotion. Initially, some reports from Surinamese media suggested the arrest stemmed from a ""neighbor dispute.""But the official Florida police report specifically identifies the victim as his wife and classifies the charges as domestic violence. As of now, the case remains pending trial. Neither Rozenstruik nor his legal representatives have issued a formal statement regarding the specific allegations of the biting incident.Also Read: Francis Ngannou's net worth timeline (2016-2026): Inside the Cameroonian star’s earnings, championships, media appearances, philanthropy and more","Former UFC heavyweight Jairzinho ""Bigi Boy"" Rozenstruik was arrested in Pembroke Pines, Florida, following a domestic violence incident involving his wife.

NOIDA: Officials of Noida Authority spent Thursday drafting replies to a detailed questionnaire from a three-member special investigation team (SIT) probing the death of 27-year-old software engineer Yuvraj Mehta, who drowned after his car plunged into a waterlogged pit in Sector 150 early on Jan 17.Formed on Monday and given five days to submit its report, the SIT asked the Authority what it did after a truck had fallen into the trench at the same spot just days earlier, and why the location was still without barricades, reflectors or warning signage when Mehta's car went in, sources said.At a meeting on Thursday, the SIT sought a step-by-step account of the Authority's response on the night of Mehta's death - when it first received information, what immediate action followed, and how field staff, control rooms and emergency response teams coordinated. Investigators are examining why rescue operations could not be initiated for nearly two hours after the car fell into the pit and Mehta kept shouting for help, waving his phone's torch. The questionnaire also focuses on road safety and waterlogging in the area, including the role of Noida traffic cell. The SIT is looking into whether the site had been identified earlier as prone to waterlogging and, if so, why preventive measures were not put in place.A large part of the probe centres around the Sports City project, which is set to be built on the plot that is currently waterlogged. Sources said the SIT asked for possession details of the 21 subdivided plots, along with information on their respective developers. It also sought clarifications on map approvals, issuance of occupancy certificates (OC) and completion certificates (CC), and the status of basic utilities such as roads, road safety infrastructure, water supply and sewerage.Officials said the team is examining whether facilities were developed in keeping with plans and whether compliance was monitored at different stages. Queries also included whether notices were issued to builders for non-compliance with development or safety norms.After the drowning, the Authority has begun corrective steps. Officials said cement block barricades would be installed on both sides of the road in Sector 150 through a tender process, with work expected to begin shortly. Directions have also been issued to drain water from potholes and waterlogged plots across sector and other parts of Noida.","Yuvraj Mehta, 27, drowned after his car plunged into a waterlogged pit in Sector 150 early on Jan 17.

Renewed nuclear warning to Iran

Iran says ‘finger on the trigger’

Protest toll disputed amid internet blackout





US President Donald Trump has said that the United States has an “armada” headed toward Iran, renewing warnings to Tehran over the killing of protesters and the potential restart of its nuclear programme.Trump’s comments came on Thursday as he returned from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and were part of an escalating standoff following internal unrest in Iran and tensions over its nuclear activities.US officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to news agency Reuters, said the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and several guided-missile destroyers are expected to arrive in the Middle East in the coming days.Additional air-defense systems are also being considered to protect US forces and bases in the region, underscoring Washington’s bolstered military options.“We have a lot of ships going that direction, just in case … I’d rather not see anything happen, but we’re watching them very closely,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One.He reiterated that the deployment was intended to deter Iranian actions and that the US “might not have to use it.”'We have an armada. We have a massive fleet heading in that direction. Maybe we won't have to use it. We'll see"", Trump said.The US President also renewed warnings to Tehran against restarting its nuclear programme, saying the US would act again if Iran resumed enrichment activities.""If they try to do it again, they have to go to another area. We'll hit them there too, just as easily,"" he said.He also repeated his claim that Iran halted nearly 840 planned executions of protesters after his threats.""I said: 'If you hang those people, you're going to be hit harder than you've ever been hit. It'll make what we did to your Iran nuclear (program) look like peanuts,'"" Trump said.Trump’s statement comes amid heightened tensions following a nationwide protest movement in Iran that erupted in late December over economic hardship and has been met with a severe crackdown, resulting in thousands of deaths, according to rights groups and Iranian sources.Iran has responded firmly to rising US pressure. General Mohammad Pakpour, the commander of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), warned the United States and Israel against “miscalculations,” saying the Guards had their “finger on the trigger” and were prepared to carry out orders from the country’s supreme leader if threatened.""The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and dear Iran have their finger on the trigger, more prepared than ever, ready to carry out the orders and measures of the supreme commander-in-chief,"" he said, as per news agency AFP.Pakpour's remarks were made in a written statement that was cited by state television, commemorating Iran's national day dedicated to the Guards, whose role is to safeguard the Islamic revolution of 1979 from both internal and external dangers.Another high-ranking military official, General Ali Abdollahi Aliabadi, who heads the Iranian joint command headquarters, cautioned that should the United States launch an attack, ""all US interests, bases, and centers of influence"" would be considered ""legitimate targets"" for Iran's military forces.Iranian authorities on Wednesday released their first official death toll from the recent protests, saying 3,117 people were killed.The figures were issued by Iran’s foundation for martyrs and veterans, which said 2,427 of those killed were “martyrs”, defined as members of the security forces or innocent bystanders, while others were described as US-backed “rioters”.President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Thursday that protest is “the natural right of citizens”, but added that a distinction must be made between protesters and those “whose hands are stained with the blood of innocent people”, reported AFP.Rights groups, however, dispute the official figures, saying the actual toll could be far higher. Iran Human Rights (IHR) said it has verified at least 3,428 killings so far, while the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) has documented 4,902 deaths.HRANA also said at least 26,541 people have been arrested.Efforts to independently verify the scale of the crackdown have been hampered by a nationwide internet shutdown, which has now lasted more than two weeks, according to internet monitor Netblocks.IHR director Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam said evidence emerging from inside Iran suggests the real death toll is “far higher than the official figure”, calling the authorities’ numbers lacking in credibility, as per AFP.","'We have an armada. We have a massive fleet heading in that direction. Maybe we won't have to use it. We'll see"", Trump said. US officials said the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and several guided-missile destroyers are expected to arrive in the Middle East in the coming days.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127223406,imgsize-1417294,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-21.jpg"

The mounting Dubai hospital bill and why it matters

Road safety on UAE highways: Beyond one crash

Insurance gaps and expat realities in Dubai and other UAE cities

What this means for road users in the UAE





An Indian expatriate in Dubai is confronting an overwhelming hospital bill of nearly Dh400,000 (approximately Rs 1 crore) after a serious motorbike accident on Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Road (E311) left him with multiple fractures and ongoing surgical needs. The situation raises broader questions about road safety, healthcare costs and insurance coverage in the UAE.On the early morning of January 18, 2026, 36-year-old Avinash Sequeira, a freelance events professional and member of the Ducati Owners Club, was on a routine weekend ride with friends when the accident occurred near Liwan, close to his home. After swapping bikes, due to a radiator leak on his own motorcycle, Avinash was heading home at around 50 km/h when the bike lost traction on a gentle curve, causing him to crash.He sustained multiple fractures to both legs and his right hip, according to medical reports. Passersby called emergency services and he was rushed to Fakeeh University Hospital for emergency trauma care. Avinash has since undergone two major surgeries to stabilise his injuries, including the insertion of steel rods in his femur and hip and faces two more surgeries, including reconstruction of the tibia below his right knee.Doctors have estimated a long recovery, months of rehabilitation before he can walk again and possibly further medical care beyond that.Without medical insurance, the costs of Avinash’s emergency care and surgeries have rapidly escalated to nearly Dh400,000, a figure that has alarmed his family and friends. Avinash’s father, Sunil Sequeira, told reporters that the family cannot afford the expenses. They were alerted to his crash when his iPhone automatically sent out an SOS alert, leading to prompt medical attention but also to soaring hospital bills.This story highlights a growing concern among many residents in the UAE: the high cost of emergency medical care for those without comprehensive health insurance, a gap that can place families under immense financial stress after accidents or sudden injuries. In some cases, expatriates have shared on local forums that lack of insurance coverage led to difficult negotiations over hospital deposits or bills in the tens of thousands for relatively minor injuries.While each accident has its own unique circumstances, Dubai Police and traffic authorities have repeatedly warned about the risks of fatigue, conditions, and behaviour on major roads such as E311 and Sheikh Zayed Road (E11). In late 2025, Dubai Police issued a public warning emphasising the dangers of fatigue driving, noting that even healthy drivers can lose control if they are unwell or overly tired, leading to high-speed collisions and serious injuries.Officers urged motorists to take regular breaks and ensure they are fully fit to drive, especially on long stretches like those on E311 and other arterial highways. Additionally, authorities have cracked down on reckless riding and high-speed behaviour, warning that passengers’ lives and riders’ own safety are at risk when traffic laws are ignored.For example, Dubai Police have arrested bikers travelling at speeds as high as 280–300 km/h on major roads, enforcing fines up to Dh50,000 and impounding vehicles to discourage dangerous conduct.The Indian biker’s lack of medical insurance underscores a broader challenge in the UAE and other Gulf States: while employers must provide health coverage for many workers, freelancers and contract workers are not always insured, especially if they work independently or under short-term arrangements. This situation is not unique. Online community posts from UAE residents reveal frequent discussions about surprise hospital costs when people without insurance or with limited plans require emergency treatment, from fractures to emergency scans or surgeries.Lack of insurance can also influence where and how patients are admitted and how expenses are handled by hospitals. The Sequeira family has appreciated the medical care and the quick response by emergency services but the financial burden looms large. They say they are relying on community support and the solidarity of fellow riders and friends as they navigate the mounting bills and long rehabilitation process.This high-cost hospital bill story reflects several intersecting issues in the UAE. For residents, especially those who drive or ride regularly, having comprehensive health and accident insurance can mean the difference between manageable costs and overwhelming financial strain after a crash.Dubai and UAE traffic authorities consistently stress safety measures such as obeying speed limits, staying alert and avoiding fatigue, crucial on high-speed corridors such as E311. A crash like Avinash’s illustrates how quickly routine rides can turn into life-changing events. For many expatriate families, a serious accident brings not just medical bills but time away from work, months of rehab and emotional strain. Friends and colleagues often rally together but the impact is deeply personal and long-lasting.As Avinash continues his recovery and additional surgeries, the road to normalcy is likely to be long and difficult. His case has sparked conversation among bikers and expatriate communities about insurance coverage, road risks and emergency planning for anyone operating vehicles on UAE highways.With serious injuries and steep medical costs and without insurance, families like the Sequeiras can face daunting choices about treatment, finances and long-term care. For residents, the message is clear: stay safe on the roads, ensure proper insurance coverage and be prepared for the unexpected because in a split second, an enjoyable weekend ride can turn into a life-altering accident.","An Indian expatriate in Dubai is confronting an overwhelming hospital bill of nearly Dh400,000 (approximately Rs 1 crore) after a serious motorbike accident.

NATO Surrenders Before Trump? ‘Only 34 Troops To Defend Greenland From US…’ | Shock Announcement





US President Donald Trump has written a blunt letter to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, linking the Nobel Committee’s decision not to award him the Nobel Peace Prize to his hardened stance on Greenland, saying he no longer feels bound to “think purely of Peace”.According to a copy of the letter obtained by Bloomberg, Trump’s message to the Norwegian leader — first reported by a PBS journalist on X — was circulated by the US National Security Council (NSC) to several other European governments, underscoring Washington’s intent to make the communication widely known.“Dear Jonas: Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America. Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a “right of ownership” anyway? There are no written documents, it’s only that a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also. I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States. The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland.Thank you! President DJT,” Trump wrote according to Bloomberg.Reacting to the letter, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre said Trump’s message was sent in response to a brief text message he had earlier conveyed to the US President.“Trump’s message came in response to a short text message to President Trump from me earlier in the day, on behalf of myself and the President of Finland, Alexander Stubb,” Støre said.Støre underlined that Trump had been repeatedly informed that the Nobel Peace Prize decision does not rest with the Norwegian government.“I have repeatedly clearly explained to Trump that it is an independent committee that awards the Nobel Peace Prize,” he said.Norway had expressed disbelief last week after Nobel Peace Prize laureate María Corina Machado handed her medal to US President Donald Trump, who has long coveted the award. Trump, who has repeatedly claimed he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for resolving multiple conflicts during his second term, accepted the medal during a meeting with the Venezuelan opposition leader at the White House.The move prompted a swift clarification from the Norwegian Nobel Committee.“The Nobel Prize and the laureate are inseparable,” the committee said in a statement on Friday. “Even if the medal or diploma later comes into someone else’s possession, this does not alter who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.”Trump’s letter to Norway PM follows a series of public statements in which he has accused Denmark of failing to counter what he describes as a Russian security threat in the Arctic.Earlier on Sunday, Trump said Denmark had not been able to do anything to remove the “Russian threat” from Greenland and added, “Now it is time, and it will be done!!!”“NATO has been telling Denmark, for 20 years, that ‘you have to get Russian threat away from Greenland.’ Unfortunately, Denmark has been unable to do anything about it,” Trump wrote in a post on his social media platform, Truth Social.Trump has repeatedly said he will settle for nothing less than ownership of Greenland, an autonomous territory that remains part of the Kingdom of Denmark.Leaders in both Denmark and Greenland have firmly rejected Trump’s position, insisting the island is not for sale and that Greenlanders do not wish to become part of the United States.The pressure campaign has also taken on an economic dimension. On Saturday, Trump vowed to impose a wave of escalating tariffs on European allies until the United States is allowed to buy Greenland.","US President Donald Trump has written a blunt letter to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre.

‘Should have put Nato to test’: Trump hints at invoking Article 5 for US border crisis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/should-have-put-nato-to-test-trump-hints-at-invoking-article-5-for-us-border-crisis/articleshow/127226598.cms,"Macron TROLLS Trump, Credits Europe's Unity For Defusing Greenland Tensions | 'Command Respect'





Days after announcing after suspending additional tariffs on eight European countries, US President Donald Trump again stoked tension with Nato by suggesting the United States should have “put Nato to the test” by invoking Article 5, the alliance’s collective defence clause but to deal with illegal immigration at the US southern border.""Maybe we should have put NATO to the test: Invoked Article 5, and forced Nato to come here and protect our Southern Border from further Invasions of Illegal Immigrants, thus freeing up large numbers of Border Patrol Agents for other tasks,"" the 47th POTUS wrote.The remark landed just as European leaders were emerging from a tense summit in Brussels, relieved that Trump had stepped back from his latest confrontation with the continent over Greenland, but acutely aware that another crisis could erupt at any moment. Trump’s recent threats to seize the Arctic island — an autonomous territory of NATO member Denmark — and to impose tariffs on European allies had plunged relations to their lowest point in decades.Those immediate threats appeared to ease after Trump announced a vague “framework” agreement following talks with NATO secretary general Mark Rutte. While Trump claimed the deal delivered “everything we wanted”, European officials were left searching for clarity.Greenland’s prime minister said he was unaware of what had been agreed, while Danish leaders stressed that sovereignty was not up for negotiation, even as they signalled openness to revisiting a 1951 defence pact with Washington.Against that backdrop, Trump’s casual suggestion that Article 5 could be repurposed for domestic US immigration enforcement struck many in Europe as emblematic of his approach to alliances: transactional, improvisational and unconcerned with long-standing norms. Article 5 has only ever been invoked once, after the 9/11 attacks, and is regarded in Europe as the bedrock of collective security against external aggression — not a tool for internal political leverage.EU leaders used the summit to underline that Europe would defend its interests and resist coercion, even as it continues to rely on US military support, particularly over Ukraine. Several diplomats privately acknowledged that dealing with Trump meant accepting a permanent state of uncertainty. As one put it, Europe is “only a tweet away from the next crisis”.Trump’s Davos appearance reinforced that sense of volatility. After restating his claims over Greenland, he abruptly ruled out the use of force, lifted tariff threats and cast himself as a global deal-maker, unveiling a new “Board of Peace” that key allies quietly boycotted. Whether this amounted to brinkmanship, improvisation or retreat depended on who was asked.What is clear is that Trump’s latest Article 5 provocation has deepened European anxiety about the durability of the transatlantic alliance — and about how far the US president is willing to bend its most sacred commitments to serve his own political battles at home.",US President Donald Trump again stoked tension with Nato by suggesting the United States should have “put Nato to the test” by invoking Article 5.

What is Trump's Board of Peace?





US President Donald Trump withdrew his invitation to Canada to join the Board of Peace after Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney rejected Trump's claims of Canada's dependence on the United States.Trump, in his post on Truth Social, wrote, ""Dear Prime Minister Carney: Please let this Letter serve to represent that the Board of Peace is withdrawing its invitation to you regarding Canada’s joining, what will be, the most prestigious Board of Leaders ever assembled, at any time.""Tensions escalated between the two leaders at the World Economic Forum on Tuesday. Carney, in his speech, took a stance against the US's ""ruptured"" global order. Following this, Trump, in his address, claimed that Canada lives because of the US.Later, Mark Carney, responding to Trump's remark in a national address at Quebec City on Thursday, claimed that Canada thrives because of itself. Acknowledging the ""remarkable partnership"" between the two nations, the press, he said, ""Canada doesn't live because of the United States. Canada thrives because we are Canadian.""He further added that Canada should serve as a model in an era of ""democratic decline.""Carney said, ""Canada can't solve all the world's problems, but we can show that another way is possible, that the arc of history isn't destined to be warped towards authoritarianism and exclusion.""Earlier in Davos, Carney, in his speech, also received a standing ovation over his stance against the ""rupture"" in the US-led, rules-based global order. He implied that the trade rules and international laws are applied based on military and economic might.In his speech, Carney said, ""We knew the story of the international rules-based order was partially false, that the strongest would exempt themselves when convenient, that trade rules were enforced asymmetrically. This fiction was useful, and American hegemony, in particular, helped provide public goods, open sea lanes, a stable financial system, collective security and support for frameworks for resolving disputes. ""Calling out the faults of the system, he said, ""We placed the sign in the window. We participated in the rituals, and we largely avoided calling out the gaps between rhetoric and reality. This bargain no longer works. Let me be direct. We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition.""Trump, later in his speech, trained guns at Carney as he said, ""I watched your prime minister yesterday. He wasn't so grateful. Canada lives because of the United States.

It was also endorsed by the UN Security Council in November for the same purpose.

In his address, Trump did not offer a clear mandate about the purpose of the board and hailed it as ""something very, very unique for the world.""He said that the board could work with the United Nations and not only resolve the wars in the Middle East but also conflicts around the world.

6-year-old walks two miles for help after father dies saving him in Upstate New York ice tragedy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/6-year-old-walks-two-miles-for-help-after-father-dies-saving-him-in-upstate-new-york-ice-tragedy/articleshow/127195488.cms,"



A 6-year-old boy braved the freezing cold and walked nearly two miles to his grandfather’s home to get help after his father and a family friend fell through the ice on an upstate New York pond and later died.New York State Police said the incident took place on Sunday evening (January 18), just before 8 p.m., on Chaumont Pond in St. Lawrence County. Authorities responded after receiving a report of individuals riding a snowmobile that had broken through the ice.Investigators determined that Bryan P LaPlante, 33, his 6-year-old son, and family friend Michael J Booth, 48, had been ice fishing on the pond. While returning, their snowmobile went through the ice, plunging all three into the frigid water.According to family members, LaPlante managed to lift his young son out of the water but was unable to save himself, New York Post reported citing family members.The man instructed the boy to walk toward his grandmother’s house and call 911, telling him to “follow the moon” to find his way.The child did exactly that, walking nearly two miles in the cold until he reached his grandfather, Patrick R LaPlante, 51. Patrick rushed back to the pond to help but fell through the ice himself while attempting a rescue.He was able to pull himself out but lost sight of the two men in the water.State police and rescue crews later located Bryan LaPlante and Booth unresponsive in the pond. Despite lifesaving efforts, both were pronounced dead at Gouverneur Hospital.The 6-year-old boy and his grandfather were treated for hypothermia at Clifton-Fine Hospital and later released.Bryan LaPlante’s sister later wrote on Facebook that her brother “died saving his son,” calling everyone involved a hero and praising the boy’s courage in making it home for help.An investigation into the incident is ongoing.","Bryan P LaPlante, 33, his 6-year-old son, and family friend Michael J Booth, 48, had been ice fishing on Chaumont Pond in St. Lawrence County, New York.

Trump Vindicated? NATO's Greenland Farce 'EXPOSED'; Military Chiefs Confess 'No Political Guidance'

Why Greenland has become a flashpoint

What European figures are saying

The Dutch position: ‘for now, no boycott’

Has a World Cup boycott happened before?





Five months before the first ball is kicked, the 2026 World Cup is already being pulled into a geopolitical argument that has nothing to do with football. The trigger is not the tournament itself, but a widening rupture between the United States and Europe, fuelled by President Donald Trump’s increasingly blunt language over Greenland and his willingness to frame territorial control as a legitimate objective.No federation has drawn a line yet. UEFA has not threatened withdrawal, and no European government has formally tied participation in the World Cup to Trump’s actions. But the conversation has shifted from fringe speculation to something more serious, surfacing in parliaments, football associations and public debate across Europe. What was once unthinkable so close to a World Cup is now being openly weighed: whether staying away from a tournament hosted in the United States could become a political signal rather than a sporting decision.Greenland’s status places Trump’s remarks in unusually sensitive territory, the island is a self-governing part of the Kingdom of Denmark, a NATO member state. The United States is also part of NATO, whose Article 5 treats an armed attack on one member as an attack on all. Against that backdrop, Trump’s public statements about annexing Greenland have alarmed European leaders.Over the weekend, Trump wrote on Truth Social that he no longer needed to “think purely of peace” when it came to controlling the world’s largest island.He has also threatened punitive tariffs against European countries that resist US demands over Greenland, deepening fears of a transatlantic rupture.On Wednesday, Trump said he had reached what he called a “framework of a future deal” with NATO, temporarily dropping the tariff threat. The announcement did not include any indication that the US would gain “ownership” of Greenland, and it remains unclear whether it would satisfy Trump in the long term.That uncertainty has fed into the World Cup debate. A coordinated withdrawal by UEFA nations would plunge the tournament into chaos: European teams account for 16 of the 48 places at the expanded World Cup, and their absence would be both a logistical disaster for FIFA and a political embarrassment for Trump, who has taken centre stage in the build-up to the event.European leaders and football officials have so far struck a careful tone, acknowledging public concern without committing to action.In Germany, Jürgen Hardt, a Bundestag member and foreign policy spokesperson for Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s Christian Democratic Union, told BILD that a boycott could be considered “as a last resort in order to get Trump to see sense on the Greenland issue”.Oke Göttlich, president of St. Pauli and a member of the executive boards of both the German FA (DFB) and the German Football League (DFL), raised the issue more pointedly in a LinkedIn post this week.“The question is indeed justified as to whether Europeans should participate in a competition in a country that is indirectly, and possibly soon directly, attacking Europe, don’t you think?” Göttlich wrote.In the UK, MPs Simon Hoare and Kate Osborne told Metro that a boycott should not be ruled out.“We should send as many messages as possible to the Trump administration and the American people that there are certain red lines in regards to upholding sovereignty and international affairs,” Hoare said. “If that means not going to the World Cup then we shouldn’t go to the World Cup.”Osborne went further, adding: “The USA should not be able to participate in the World Cup, let alone be part of hosting it, so yes I support those calling for a boycott.”France’s sports minister, Marina Ferrari, adopted a cautious stance amid growing debate over a potential European boycott of the 2026 World Cup.“At the moment we are speaking, there is no desire from the ministry to boycott this major, much-anticipated competition,” Ferrari told reporters on Tuesday, as cited by the Associated Press. “That said, I am not prejudging what might happen.”Ferrari emphasized the importance of keeping sports and politics separate. “The 2026 World Cup is an extremely important moment for all sports lovers,” she said.In the Netherlands, debate has intensified as Trump’s threats have escalated. The Dutch FA (KNVB) has issued multiple statements aimed at lowering the temperature.KNVB secretary general Gijs de Jong said he was “aware of geopolitical developments” concerning the United States, but stressed that any decision would be guided by FIFA, UEFA, and the Dutch government.“We live in a rapidly changing world,” De Jong said. “Therefore, we closely monitor international developments, in consultation with FIFA, UEFA, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and local embassies.”He added that the association remained “alert and flexible”, but that its priority was allowing players and staff to focus on football.“It is up to the Dutch government to determine its position on international political developments,” De Jong said. “By continuing to play football and engage in dialogue, we link our progressive stance to our values, convinced that football can unite.”KNVB president Frank Paauw echoed that position during an award ceremony in The Hague, saying the Netherlands would “so far” not boycott the World Cup.Paauw acknowledged that Trump “draws new lines” in global politics and “threatens a lot”, but insisted the federation would not act independently of political authorities.“As long as politicians do not engage in politics, we will not engage in politics either,” he said.Calls for a boycott are nevertheless gaining traction domestically. Dutch journalist and opinion-maker Teun van de Keuken has organised a petition urging the KNVB to withdraw from the tournament, which has attracted nearly 120,000 signatures. The petition argues that participation would amount to tacit support for Trump’s immigration policies and expansionist rhetoric.Boycotts are rare but not unprecedented in World Cup history. Since the tournament began in 1930, nine countries, and once, an entire continent, have boycotted editions of the competition.Uruguay refused to defend its title in 1934, declining to travel to Italy, and also boycotted the 1938 World Cup alongside Argentina. India withdrew in 1950, while Turkey, Indonesia, Egypt and Sudan pulled out of qualifying in 1958. In 1966, all African nations boycotted the tournament in protest at the allocation of places. The most recent boycott came in 1974, when the Soviet Union refused to play Chile in a qualifying playoff.More than half a century on, the question now facing Europe is whether geopolitical pressure, alliance politics and public opinion could again collide with football, and whether the 2026 World Cup could become the stage on which that conflict plays out.","The 2026 World Cup is already being pulled into a geopolitical argument that has nothing to do with football.

Former CNN anchor Don Lemon, who was inside the Minnesota church when it was disrupted by anti-ICE protesters, triggering suspicion that he was aware of the planned protest, is not facing charges now as a federal magistrate judge rejected the Justice Department's attempt to formally charge him. According to insiders, this enraged Attorney General Pam Bondi and she said she will be coming to Minnesota herself.The Sunday service of the church was disrupted when the protesters stormed the church, suspecting ICE links of the pastor. The protesters said the pastor was the acting field director of a local ICE office.This was a major flare-up in Minnesota after Renee Good's death on January 7 when the Minneapolis woman was shot dead by 'defensive' firing of ICE agent Jonathan Ross. Minnesota has been on fire since then as ICE strengthened its crackdown and protesters doubled down on their resistance.The Justice Department condemned the church incident and said they will charge Don Lemon for his coverage of the event. ""Don Lemon himself has come out and said he knew exactly what was going to happen inside that facility,"" Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon said on “The Benny Show.” ""He went into the facility, and then he began — quote, unquote — 'committing journalism,' as if that’s sort of a shield from being a part, an embedded part, of a criminal conspiracy.It isn’t.""Even President Donald Trump spoke against Don Lemon. “I saw him the way he walked in that church, it was terrible,” Trump said of Lemon earlier this week. “I have such respect for that pastor. He was so calm, he was so nice. He was just accosted. What they did in that church was horrible.”Don Lemon said he was not the only reporter there but he was being targeted. ""That framing is telling,"" he said. ""What’s even more telling is the barrage of violent threats, along with homophobic and racist slurs, directed at me online by MAGA supporters and amplified by parts of the right-wing press.""Two protesters, called the leaders of the church storming, have been arrested by the FBI Thursday.

Dozens feared missing



Compensation announced for victims’ families







The death toll from a devastating fire at a major shopping plaza in Pakistan’s largest city, Karachi, has risen to 26, with authorities warning that the number could climb further as search operations continue, as reported by Geo TV. The blaze tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market, late on Saturday night, trapping dozens inside.Rescue teams gained fuller access to the building nearly 24 hours later, after firefighters managed to bring the inferno under control. Officials said smoke was still rising from the structure on Monday, complicating efforts to locate missing people.Rescue 1122 Sindh spokesperson Hassan Khan said 21 bodies had been recovered so far, adding that search operations were still under way. “The search will continue,” he said, as concerns remain over possible structural collapses inside the severely damaged building.Mohammed Shah, part of the Pakistan Navy’s rescue team, described the incident as a “deep-seated fire”, noting that smoke continued to emanate from the debris despite the flames being largely extinguished. Firefighters said the blaze had been brought 95 per cent under control, with cooling operations now in progress.Officials warned that the weakened structure posed serious dangers. Portions of the building’s front and back façades have collapsed, while cracks have been detected inside.Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah said authorities were still trying to establish the final death toll. Speaking at a press conference, he said around 65 people who were reported to have visited Gul Plaza remain unaccounted for, raising fears that casualties could rise sharply.“I cannot give a final number as of yet,” he said. “There has been a considerable loss of lives in this incident.”South DIG Syed Asad Raza said more areas of the plaza were yet to be cleared, and warned the number of fatalities could increase as debris is removed.The Sindh government has announced Rs10 million (£28,000) in compensation for the family of each person killed. “There can be no price tag on a life,” the chief minister said, adding that the compensation process would begin immediately.He also confirmed that one firefighter was among those who lost their lives.The cause of the fire has not yet been confirmed. Officials initially suspect an electrical short circuit, though a forensic investigation has been ordered. Police said samples had been collected for DNA matching to help identify victims.Authorities revealed that although the plaza had 16 gates, only three exits were open at the time of the fire, raising serious questions over safety compliance.Karachi has witnessed repeated fatal fires, often linked to poor safety standards, illegal construction and inadequate fire prevention systems. A government audit in 2024 found that the vast majority of commercial buildings in the city lacked proper fire safety measures.","Blaze tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market, late on Saturday night, trapping dozens inside.

Multiple cases have been registered against him since then.PTI further said that Khan has been held in solitary confinement, adding that “prolonged solitary confinement is viewed under international law as harmful and potentially constituting cruel, inhuman” treatment when imposed without clear justification or safeguards.The party added that Khan has been completely isolated in a cell and “even the basic necessities guaranteed under the jail manual have been denied to him.”PTI criticised the government for failing to explain why Khan has not been able to meet his lawyers, a constitutional right for any prisoner, let alone a former prime minister.

Karachi Gul Plaza Fire Claims At Least 10 Lives, Dozens Missing As Rescue Operations Continue





The death toll from a major fire at an old shopping mall in Pakistan’s Karachi has risen to 14 after rescue teams recovered eight more bodies from the debris, officials said on Monday.The blaze broke out late Saturday night at Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market on MA Jinnah Road in the city’s Saddar area. The fire was brought under control by Sunday night, but rescue operations continued as large parts of the building suffered severe structural damage.Six bodies were found soon after the fire erupted, with officials saying the victims likely died of suffocation. Dozens of injured people were rushed to nearby hospitals. As the fire spread rapidly, thick smoke and intense heat initially prevented rescue teams from entering the building.“Once the fire was doused, we didn’t wait for the cooling period and forcibly went in to rescue trapped people and we found eight more bodies, some badly charred,” Rescue 1122 Chief Operating Officer Abid Jalal told PTI.Jalal said the fire had almost completely damaged the building, with both the front and rear portions collapsing due to weakened pillars.“The structure has become extremely unsafe, and we are still searching as there is a risk of further collapses,” he said.Gul Plaza, built in the early 1980s, houses around 1,200 shops spread across a basement, mezzanine and three upper floors. It has long been a prominent commercial hub in Karachi.Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, who visited the site on Monday, said authorities feared that dozens of people could still be trapped inside. “We are extremely concerned and alarmed. Efforts are going on to find them but this is a national tragedy,” he told reporters.South Deputy Inspector General of Police Syed Asad Raza said the casualty count could rise as large sections of the building were yet to be searched. Officials suspect an electrical short circuit may have caused the fire, though the exact cause will be confirmed after a full investigation.The incident has once again highlighted serious fire safety concerns in Karachi. In recent years, several commercial buildings in the city have caught fire due to poor safety measures, faulty electrical systems and illegal construction.A government audit in 2024 found that most shopping malls lacked proper fire safety systems, emergency exits and compliant wiring.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari expressed grief over the loss of lives, while the Sindh government has ordered an inquiry into the incident.","The death toll from a major fire at an old shopping mall in Pakistan's Karachi has risen to 14.
