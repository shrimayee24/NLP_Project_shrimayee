IMPHAL/NEW DELHI: Security forces in Manipur have arrested more than 350 insurgents during intensified crackdown on extortion rackets that have taken an unusual turn, with groups mainly from the Valley now demanding money to resolve matrimonial disputes, along with traditional targets like property and “cuts” in govt tenders, officials said on Sunday. The insurgents were picked from mid-Feb this year after the imposition of President’s rule in the state.A clear instruction has been issued by the governor’s administration to the general public to report any extortion attempts to police or face legal consequences for aiding the insurgents.The officials said investigations against the more than 350 people arrested in the crackdown indicate that insurgent groups, feeling the pressure from security forces post-President’s rule, are becoming more desperate for funds and more brazen in their methods.The majority of insurgents have been nabbed from Imphal East, followed by Imphal West in the valley. It's just about money, and for that, they settle personal scores, family feuds and even matrimonial disputes. If you have a problem, and you have the right connections, they become your ‘solution’ but for a price, of course, the officials said.Recently, a person codenamed ‘Tiger’ was picked up from Imphal East by Manipur police while he was busy settling a matrimonial dispute with family members of a bride and groom, the officials said. Later, he was identified as Laishram Ramesh Singh, belonging to the banned United National Liberation Front (UNLF). During preliminary verification, he told the police that he joined the organisation in Sept 2024 and is presently working in its “finance section”.The officials said he confessed to being involved in extortion activities by serving monetary demands and threats and by collecting money from government officials located in and around the Imphal area, besides collecting “cuts” from business houses who had been allotted various government tenders.Two mobile handsets and Rs 21,50,000 of extortion money were recovered from him.The officials said the insurgent groups were exploiting technology and one of the tactics involved obtaining SIM cards with false documentation from any northeastern state and using them to make Voice over Internet Protocol calls routed through Wi-Fi networks.","Security forces in Manipur have arrested more than 350 insurgents during intensified crackdown on extortion rackets.

Right to shelter

is fundamental right: CJI on bulldozer justice

MUMBAI: Amidst the debate over the timelines set by the SC for governors and the President, Chief Justice of India Bhushan Gavai on Sunday said neither the judiciary nor the executive or the legislature had an upper hand, but rather it is the Constitution of India that is “supreme” and “all the three wings have to work together as per the Constitution.The statement comes barely days after President Droupadi Murmu sent a 14-point Presidential Reference to SC asking if the court can “impose” timelines and prescribe the conduct of governors and the President when handling state bills sent for assent or reserved for consideration. Centre had accused SC of stepping into executive domain.Justice Gavai, who took oath as the 52nd CJI last week, was speaking at a felicitation function organised by the Bar Council of Maharashtra and Goa . Justice Gavai said, “The basic structure is strong, and all three pillars of the Constitution are equal. And all the organs of the Constitution must reciprocate and give due respect to each other,” he said.Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, but it cannot touch the “basic structure”, he said. The ‘basic structure’ doctrine holds that certain fundamental features of the Constitution, such as its supremacy, the rule of law, and independence of the judiciary, cannot be amended or abrogated by Parliament through a constitutional amendment.The recent Presidential Reference invoked SC’s advisory jurisdiction under Article 143 (1) of the Constitution to determine if timelines can be set.The President’s move stemmed from a May 8 judgment by an SC bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan on a petition by the Tamil Nadu govt challenging the governor’s delay in clearing bills passed a second time by the legislature and his move to reserve them for the President’s consideration.The reference pointed out that “there are conflicting judgments of the Supreme Court as to whether the assent of the President of India under Article 201 of the Constitution of India is justiciable or not”.In April, while hearing two matters before his elevation as CJI, Justice Gavai had observed, “As it is, we are alleged of encroaching upon the parliamentary and executive functions .” The executive had questioned apparent judicial overreach while hearing a matter over violence in West Bengal. In another matter regarding explicit online content, Justice Gavai had orally observed that it was for the Union to frame rules in that regard. “As it is, we are now criticised that we are interfering with the executive’s function, the legislative functions ,” he had said.Gavai on Sunday said he was glad that the country has not only strengthened, but developed on the social and economic justice fronts. Referring to his judgment against ‘bulldozer justice’, he said the right to shelter is supreme.“The right to shelter is a fundamental right. Whether a person is accused of any crime or convicted, the family’s house, if legally occupied, cannot be removed or demolished. The rule of law has to be followed.”Regarding his visits to various areas across the country, including Maharashtra, he said, “We also recently visited Manipur and assured both warring communities that the country is with you and justice is at your doorstep, so avail it.”The event also saw the release of a book chronicling 50 remarkable judgments pronounced by Justice Gavai.",Justice Gavai was speaking at a felicitation function organised by the Bar Council of Maharashtra and Goa.

She was in Pakistan before the Pahalgam attack , and the investigation is ongoing to establish any possible linkages,” he told reporters.Police said she had travelled twice to Pakistan and was in touch with other Indian influencers as well as Pakistan Information Officers (PIOs). During questioning, she reportedly admitted to meeting a Pakistani officer, Ahsan-ur-Rahim alias Danish, at the Pakistan High Commission in Delhi in 2023. She allegedly exchanged numbers with him and later met with Pakistani intelligence officials during her trips.“Suspicious materials were recovered from her mobile phone and laptop,” said Hisar DSP Kamaljeet.

Paksitan's China-borrowed air def system remained unused: Amit Shah,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/paksitans-china-borrowed-air-def-system-remained-unused-amit-shah/articleshow/121254850.cms,"Union home minister Amit Shah (PTI Photo)

GANDHINAGAR: Operation Sindoor dismantled terrorist infrastructure inside Pakistan and exposed Islamabad’s longstanding denial of harbouring terrorism, Union home minister Amit Shah said Sunday in Ahmedabad. “As our indigenously developed BrahMos (supersonic cruise missile) destroyed Pakistan’s airbases, its air defence system — borrowed from China — remained unused,” he said.Shah said armed forces penetrated 100km into Pakistani territory in response to Pahalgam terrorist attack that claimed 26 lives. The operation, he said, obliterated terrorist hubs in both Pakistan and PoK. “Our air force carried out precise attacks on locations previously considered impregnable. Operation Sindoor will be written in golden letters when the history of border security is recorded,” he said.Shah contrasted the mission with earlier surgical and airstrikes, saying those were confined to POK, whereas Operation Sindoor targeted deep Pakistani territory. He said Pakistan was exposed globally when Indian missiles took out terrorists whom Pakistan claimed did not exist on its soil. “Terrorists were eliminated, and the next day senior officers of Pakistani army attended their funerals and offered prayers — revealing the direct link between Pakistan, its army, and terrorism,” Shah said.Shah credited Modi’s “strong political will”, along with military precision and intelligence accuracy, for the operation’s success. Shah said govt had sent a clear message to Pakistan: terrorism and trade cannot coexist: “Modiji made it clear that Indus and blood will not flow together.”","Shah said armed forces penetrated 100km into Pakistani territory in response to Pahalgam terrorist attack that claimed 26 lives.

CRPF DG: Operation Blackforest marks ‘beginning of end of Naxalism’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/crpf-dg-operation-blackforest-marks-beginning-of-end-of-naxalism/articleshow/121254833.cms,"File photo

BIJAPUR: As CRPF DG G P Singh puts it succinctly, the 21-day “largest-ever” anti-Naxal operation in the Karregattalu Hills on the Chhattisgarh-Telangana border was “the beginning of the end of Left-Wing extremism”.Ahead of the March 31, 2026 deadline set by home minister Amit Shah to eliminate Naxalism from the country, security forces have their task cut out — keep up the pressure on Maoists by continuing to overwhelm them with sustained operations across the regions where they still operate, albeit in segregated groups with an eroded arsenal; corner them so that they are left with just two options: surrender or get neutralised; and block all avenues for the Maoists to regroup and re-enter areas now free from their hold, while also offering the locals benefits of govt’s flagship schemes in the secure bubble created by CRPF’s forward operating bases there.Operation Blackforest — which showcased exemplary coordination among central and state security forces, culminating in the elimination of 31 Maoists and segregating their strongest formations into disjointed, dislocated units — shall serve as a template for more intel-based actions in the days and months to come, as per sources. The follow-up operations will possibly be on a smaller scale, since the Maoists are now hiding in smaller groups, scattered across pockets of Indravati national park area, west Bastar, south Bastar, Telangana and a small portion of few other states.“Anti-Naxal operations are currently under way in Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Jharkhand, Bihar and Maharashtra as part of a multi-front offensive to wipe out the vestiges of Maoist setups there. Already, 5-6 appeals have been made by CPI(Maoist) requesting a ceasefire and dialogue, indicating their desperation,” a senior Chhattisgarh Police official told TOI.A senior central govt functionary, however, said stopping operations may not be an option while the top CPI(Maoist) leadership is still in hiding. “Let them come out and surrender their arms. We cannot talk to a ‘faceless’ group,” said the officer.Surrenders have already peaked this year, with 718 Maoists having joined the mainstream in the first four months as against 928 throughout 2024. “As the pressure grows with more anti-Naxal operations, more surrenders will follow; there is already growing disenchantment within as the top Maoist leadership remains silent and safely ensconced even as the senior Maoists and cadres are getting killed,” said the functionary.Sources said that though only 31 bodies of Maoists killed in Operation Blackforest were recovered, the forces’ own estimate points to 40-45 fatalities. “At least two dead whose bodies could not be retrieved, were very senior Maoist cadres,” said a senior CRPF officer involved in the operation.The officer told TOI that intel-based, anti-Maoist operations will continue even during the monsoon, as the forces are now placed on either side of the Indravati river. “Earlier, a swollen Indravati river and rainwater channels during monsoon would cut off access to the interior Maoist dens; now, the forces can embark on operations from the nearest FOB,” he said.With good technical intelligence, the Maoist hideouts are no longer ‘dark spots’. The forces are confident that the smaller and scattered groups of Maoists/PLGA will be located and neutralised. “The morale of the forces is high and Operation Blackforest has conditioned us physically and mentally to corner Maoists in their core area,” said a second CRPF officer.“It is possible that Left-Wing extremism will be eliminated a few months earlier than the March 2026 deadline,” the officer said but warned that the Maoists may resort to desperate attacks like killing civilians on the pretext of being “informers” and targeting security forces with IEDs improvised to inflict maximum casualty.","The 21-day ‘largest-ever’ anti-Naxal operation in the Karregattalu Hills on the Chhattisgarh-Telangana border was ‘the beginning of the end of Left-Wing extremism’ The follow-up operations will possibly be on a smaller scale, since the Maoists are now hiding in smaller groups.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121254829,imgsize-71018,width-400,resizemode-4/Its-beginning-of-end-of-Naxalism-says-CRPF-DG-after-Op-Blackforest.jpg"

The visuals include Pakistani missiles that missed their targets and debris found in agricultural lands.The video then shifts to India’s swift and precise retaliation, displaying the destruction of Pakistan’s terror infrastructure.

Didn’t ask Congress for names for foreign outreach: Govt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/didnt-ask-congress-for-names-for-foreign-outreach-govt/articleshow/121255131.cms,"Union minister Kiren Rijiju

Didn’t go by Congress’s internal dynamics: Rijiju

NEW DELHI: The govt has dismissed Congress’s charge that it asked the opposition party to nominate four MPs for all-party delegations going abroad for anti-terror outreach , only to reject three of them.Leader of opposition in LS Rahul Gandhi and Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge were informed about the delegations only as a matter of courtesy, parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju said in his first formal response to Congress’s charge.In an exclusive conversation with TOI, Rijiju also said asking parties to recommend their nominees had never been the practice. “We let them know as a matter of sheer courtesy,” he said.Seven delegations of MPs are headed to different parts of the world to sensitise global opinion on Pakistan’s continuing use of terrorism. Four Congress MPs are part of the teams; Kerala MP Shashi Tharoor heads one of the delegations.Asked about Congress’s criticism of the choices from its ranks, Rijiju maintained that the govt went by who would be more suitable for the delegations’ mission. “We are surprised by the opposition to the nomination of their members like Shashi Tharoor and Manish Tewari. The two have been essential voices from their side in any debate on foreign policy and matters related to national security . And it is not even a year since they recommended Tharoor to head the standing committee on external affairs,” the minister said.Responding to the suggestion implied in Congress’s criticism that Tharoor and Tewari were picked to taunt the party leadership, Rijiju said, “This is an insinuation. We did not go by a party’s internal dynamics and the insecurity and jealousies that come with that. We also chose Salman Khurshid and Amar Singh, their MP from Punjab. What do you have to say about those?”Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh had criticised the govt for settling on the names of Tharoor and Tewari at the expense of Rahul Gandhi’s recommendations. “This proves the complete insincerity of the Modi govt and shows the cheap political games it always played on national issues,” he had said.Congress believes Tharoor, formerly with the United Nations and also minister of state for external affairs, was chosen because he took a different line from the party on Operation Sindoor . His statement last week that he was proud of the operation came just when Congress had announced its plan to sharpen the charge that US President Donald Trump had brokered the ceasefire with Pakistan. When told that his views were at odds with Congress’s official line, the Thiruvananthapuram MP had said he was “speaking as a proud Indian”. Few were surprised when Rahul left him off the list that included Gaurav Gogoi, Anand Sharma, Raja Warring and Syed Naseer Hussain. The govt only accepted Sharma, former commerce minister.BJP spokesperson Amit Malviya had defended the decision saying that three supporters of Hussain were arrested for shouting “Pakistan Zindabad” to celebrate his election to Rajya Sabha. Malviya had also questioned Congress’s choice of Gogoi, saying the Congress deputy leader in LS had spent 15 days in Pakistan, while his wife was involved with an NGO focused on Pakistan.",Seven delegations of MPs are headed to different parts of the world to sensitise global opinion on Pakistan’s continuing use of terrorism.

The ugly Sarma vs Gogoi fight



NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Sunday launched a sharp attack on Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi , alleging that he had visited Pakistan on ""ISI's invitation"" and worked closely with the establishment. Responding to the allegation, Gogoi hit back, calling the chief minister a ""troll.""Speaking to reporters, Sarma claimed, ""Gaurav Gogoi visited Pakistan on an invitation of the ISI. For the first time, I am saying this. We have documents of the same. He did not go for tourism purposes. He went there definitely for taking training.""Sarma added that Gogoi, who is the deputy leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha, travelled on a direct invitation from the Pakistan government, calling the visit ""dangerous.""""He was (working) closely with the Pakistan establishment. When does the Home Department send an invitation? It is only to impart training,"" Sarma asserted.""An invitation from the foreign affairs (department) or any university is altogether a different thing. This was not from the foreign affairs or cultural departments. He went there on a direct invitation from the home department of Pakistan,"" he added.The CM further claimed that the government has solid proof of Gogoi’s visit and said that there’s no way he can deny or escape from it.""All his paths are closed. We have seen the evidence. Only we need time till September to get the papers. We have to submit a notice and then the embassy will provide us with the documents. September 10 is final and please do not ask about this again till that time,"" Sarma noted.Responding to the Assam CM's remarks, Gaurav Gogoi called them ""absurd"". In a series of posts on X, Gogoi reflected on the chief minister's mental state and said he has been targeted with baseless claims for years.In one post he said, ""I am worried about the health of the chief minister of Assam. For some reason best known to him I have been on his radar since my entry into Assam. He has made many baseless remarks about me in the past 13 years. The most recent one borders on insanity and the absurd. It is often said that when there is something bothering at home, it reflects in the mental state of the person. We will ensure that after 2026 he gets to have some rest.""In a separate post he wrote, ""The script that the chief minister is following is worse than a B grade film. It is said to cover up one lie a person has to say countless lies. That is exactly what the chief minister is doing.""""He is not giving out any facts and simply behaving like a IT cell troll. A Chief Minister should not be a troll. If he has any facts supporting his most recent allegation he should put out in public domain. The farce cannot be hidden for too long,"" he added.Earlier, Sarma had posted a series of pointed questions on X regarding the MP’s alleged visit to Pakistan and his family's ties to a Pakistan-based NGO. Without naming Gogoi directly, Sarma had asked whether the Congress leader had visited Pakistan for 15 consecutive days and demanded clarification on the purpose of the trip.“Questions for the Hon’ble Member of Parliament from the Congress Party : 1. Did you visit Pakistan for a continuous period of 15 days? If so, could you kindly clarify the purpose of your visit?” Sarma had said in his post. ""If so, may we ask why a Pakistan-based organisation is paying a salary for activities conducted in India?"" Sarma had questioned.Responding to the CM, Gogoi had hit back, asking if Sarma would resign in case he fails to prove his allegations. ""Questions for the Hon’ble Chief Minister of Assam: 1) Will you resign if you fail to prove your allegations of me and my wife being agents of an enemy country? 2) Will you take questions on your own children and wife? 3) Will the state police arrest those linked to coal mafia who make are ravaging the hills of Assam and making crores of undeclared money? Waiting for the SIT report to be submitted,"" Gogoi wrote on X.The exchange of words didn't stop at Gogoi's questions as Sarma responded to the Congress leader, saying ""sufficient material will be placed in the public domain exposing the connections between the concerned Congress Member of Parliament and Pakistan"".""I would like to clarify that neither I nor my son and daughter have ever visited Pakistan. Furthermore, my wife and our entire family would never even think of accepting any salary or financial support from Pakistan. All members of my family, including my wife, son, and daughter, are Indian citizens. None of my children has ever surrendered or renounced Indian citizenship. Now, it is your turn to answer. In the coming days, sufficient material will be placed in the public domain exposing the connections between the concerned Congress Member of Parliament and Pakistan. Wait for 10th September 2025,"" the Assam CM wrote in a reply to Gogoi.Gogoi again repeated his questions in response to the Assam CM's assertions. ""None of the questions answered. I will repeat. 1) Will you resign if you fail to prove your allegations of me and my wife being agents of an enemy country? 2) Will you take questions on your own children and wife? 3) Will the state police arrest those linked to coal mafia who make are ravaging the hills of Assam and making crores of undeclared money? Wait for 2026,"" the Congress MP wrote.Sarma further alleged that the MP’s wife ""continues to receive a salary from a Pakistan-based NGO while residing and working in India."" In another claim, Sarma said that only Gogoi in his family holds Indian citizenship, while his two children have surrendered theirs.""The father of the children who is an MP surrendered their citizenship. It is not the children, who are innocent, but their father who surrendered it. I wonder how the children will react when they grow up and realise that they are not a citizen of a country where their grandfather was the chief minister of a state for 15 years,"" Sarma said. ""This is both morally and legally wrong,"" he added.","Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma alleges Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi visited Pakistan on ""ISI's invitation"" Sarma: ""He was (working) closely with the Pakistan establishment.

Poll Do you agree with the arrest of Ali Khan Mahmudabad for his social media comments? No, it was an infringement on free speech Yes, it was justified

NEW DELHI: An associate professor from a private university was arrested on Sunday for a social media post related to Operation Sindoor . The arrest of Ali Khan Mahmudabad , who teaches at Ashoka University , was based on a complaint filed by a BJP Yuva Morcha leader, news agency PTI reported.""Ali Khan Mahmudabad has been arrested from Delhi,"" Ajeet Singh, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), Rai police station, was quoted as saying by the news agency PTI. He confirmed that the arrest is linked to remarks made about Operation Sindoor.According to, the student newspaper of Ashoka University, the associate professor was taken from his residence in Delhi on Sunday morning and is currently being held at the Rai police station in Haryana.The Haryana state commission for women had earlier issued a notice to Mahmudabad regarding his comments on Operation Sindoor. The notice, dated May 12, said that the Commission had taken suo motu cognisance of the ""public statements/remarks"" made by him ""on or about May 7."" Mahmudabad heads the political science department at Ashoka University in Sonipat.On May 8, Ali Khan Mahmudabad, head of the political science department at Ashoka University, posted on social media pointing out what he saw as irony in the praise from right-wing commentators for Colonel Sofia Qureshi. Qureshi had represented the Army during media briefings on India’s military strikes on terrorist camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.""Perhaps they could also equally loudly demand that the victims of mob lynchings, arbitrary bulldozing and others who are victims of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s hate mongering be protected as Indian citizens,"" he had written.Mahmudabad also said the appearance of Qureshi and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh at press briefings was significant, but added that ""optics must translate to reality on the ground otherwise it’s just hypocrisy.""The professor added in his facebook post, ""For me the press conference was just a fleeting glimpse- an illusion and allusion perhaps- to an India that defied the logic on which Pakistan was built. As I said, the grassroots reality that common Muslims face is different from what the government tried to show but at the same time the press conference shows that an India, united it its diversity, is not completely dead as an idea.""He later said the women’s commission had ""completely misunderstood"" his comments and that its notice did not show how his posts were ""contrary to the right of or laws for women.""Mahmudabad said, ""If anything, my entire comments were about safeguarding the lives of both citizens and soldiers. Furthermore, there is nothing remotely misogynistic about my comments that could be construed as anti-women.""On May 7, Armed forces carried out Operation Sindoor, targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. This action came in response to the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, in which 26 people were killed.",The arrest of Ali Khan Mahmudabad was based on a complaint filed by a BJP Yuva Morcha leader. He heads the political science department at Ashoka University in Sonipat. The arrest is linked to remarks made about Operation Sindoor.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121246902,imgsize-33192,width-400,resizemode-4/Op-Sindoor.jpg"

CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin has written to his counterparts in seven non-BJP governed states and a UT, urging a united legal fight against the Presidential reference to the Supreme Court on the power of governors.The letter was sent on May 17 to CMs of West Bengal, Kerala, Karnataka, Telangana, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Punjab and J&K to oppose the reference sought by the President in the apex court. “We must evolve a coordinated legal strategy before the court and present a united front to preserve and protect the basic structure of the Constitution,” he wrote.The letter was in response to President Droupadi Murmu invoking Article 143 of the Constitution to seek SC’s opinion on 14 legal questions. While the reference does not name any specific case, Stalin said the move was an attempt to dilute the SC’s ruling in State of Tamil Nadu vs governor of TN case. “This historic judgment, obtained by my govt, is not just a victory for Tamil Nadu but for all states,” Stalin wrote. “It prevents the obstruction of democratically enacted state legislations by governors who are unelected appointees of the Union govt,” he said. The judgment had laid down a timeline for governors to grant assent to state Bills.Stalin said the Centre ’s attempt to revisit this ruling via the court’s advisory jurisdiction is an “effort to unsettle the judgment” and warned that the move could erode the federal structure enshrined in the Constitution. He said it was the BJP govt which advised the President to seek a reference before the SC, which “pointed to the sinister intent” of BJP.“BJP is attempting to unsettle this judgment, which can be invoked as a precedent by other states when faced with an obstinate governor,” Stalin wrote, adding he was hopeful of an immediate and personal intervention of the eight CMs on the issue.","Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin has written to his counterparts in seven non-BJP governed states and a UT.

KOLHAPUR: Eight people died early Sunday when a fire swept through a textile factory in Maharashtra’s Solapur district. Among the dead were 1.5-year-old child Yusuf Mansuri and his 87-year-old grandfather Usman Mansuri , owner and founder of the factory that produced bath and hand towels.The blaze broke out between 3.30am and 4am at Central Textile Company in Akkalkot Road MIDC , likely triggered by an electrical short circuit. Victims included four members of the factory owner’s family and four from a worker’s family who lived at the site.Rescue efforts were hampered by a religious structure erected near the main entrance by the owner’s family. Firefighters accessed the building using ladders and breached a 20-foot back wall to enter. Three people were pulled out alive, but thick smoke and flames stalled further rescues. Three firefighters, including the chief fire officer, suffered burns on their palms and faces. They continued efforts through the morning and afternoon. Around 8am, bodies of Mehtab Bagwan (51), Hina Bagwan (35), and Salman Bagwan (18) were found. By 3pm, remains of Usman, Anas Mansuri (24), Shika Mansuri (24), Yusuf, and Ayesha Bagwan (45) were also found. While the Mansuris were related to the owner, the Bagwans were from the worker’s family. A distant relative identified the Mansuri family’s remains. No immediate family members survived.SDO Sadashiv Paddune said the factory spanned roughly 10,000 to 12,000 sqft. Residents reported hearing a loud sound before flames erupted. The fire raged for six to seven hours, with recovery efforts lasting over 12 hours. Property losses, including machinery and raw material, are estimated at Rs 1 crore.","The blaze broke out between 3.30am and 4am at Central Textile Company in Akkalkot Road MIDC.

HYDERABAD: The sight of an elderly woman’s charred body tightly hugging four children – all of them dead – will haunt first responders Mir Zahid and Mohd Azmat for a long time.“When we managed to get inside the building and reached the first floor, we saw this woman with her arms around the kids – two girls, a boy and an infant. She must have tried to shield them from the advancing flames,” said Zahid, a resident of the Gulzar Houz neighbourhood where 17 members of a jeweller’s family died in a blaze early Sunday.The woman was clasping a mobile phone with the torch on, suggesting she was unable to see anything because of the smoke. “They had little chance of escaping,” Zahid said.Fellow volunteer Azmat said that was the moment he knew there would be no survivors. “We put a bedsheet on them. It was an unbearable scene. I don’t think I will ever be able to put into words what I saw in that house,” he said.The men found two more bodies in the same room.Zahid and his friends had entered the building by demolishing the wall of an adjacent structure.","First responders Mir Zahid and Mohd Azmat saw the woman with her arms around the kids.

At least 50 people had a miraculous escape in a similar fire some 8km away at a residential building in Hyderabad’s Mailardevpally.Those rescued include children as young as 15 months to 2 years. The fire broke out at 7.18am in a building which houses 10-15 families, at Mughal Colony in Udamgadda. The blaze began due to an electrical short-circuit on the ground floor, which contained motor pumps, defunct bicycles, and various waste material, contributing to the flames. Officials said had the fire occurred a few hours earlier when residents were asleep, it could have mirrored the Gulzar Houz tragedy.“Most occupants had just woken up and were preparing to start the day. The blaze erupted within moments. As dense smoke began making its way upwards, residents rushed to the terrace. Fire service personnel rescued them,” said a fire officer. The fire was contained within 90 minutes.Meanwhile, chief minister A Revanth Reddy on Sunday announced a comprehensive inquiry into the Gulzar Houz fire accident, based on which an action plan will be evolved to prevent such incidents in the future.","At least 50 people had a miraculous escape in a similar fire some 8km away at a residential building in Hyderabad’s Mailardevpally.

ISI had warned him

‘Saifullah confidante of LeT launch commander’

NEW DELHI: Abu Saifullah , a high-ranking Lashkar-e-Taiba operative and key recruiter, was shot dead by unidentified gunmen in Pakistan’s Sindh province early on Sunday, dealing a significant blow to the terror outfit, already reeling from the aftermath of Operation Sindoor Saifullah had been overseeing the group’s operations in Nepal, and was a key plotter in multiple terrorist attacks in India in the early 2000s, including one on RSS headquarters in Nagpur in 2006, the 2008 strike on a CRPF camp in UP’s Rampur and the attack on IISc in Bengaluru in 2005.Saifullah’s signature tactic of deploying jihadis disguised in Army fatigues or police uniforms was a distinctive feature in all three attacks, a source said.Of late, Saifullah had been asked by ISI to restrict his movements and was also provided security cover. “However, today, he had stepped out of his house in the city of Matli when he was gunned down at a nearby intersection by unidentified armed assailants on a bike,” Pak police told the local press.Saifullah was a confidante of LeT’s launch commander Azam Cheema aka Babaji, sources said. Originally named Razaullah Nizamani, he was rechristened Abu Saifullah while being dispatched for terrorist activities in Kashmir. Upon his return, Lashkar’s top brass gave him the title ‘Ghazi’, a highly sought after label by jihadis. He was since known as Ghazi Abu Saifullah.Saifullah had nine aliases, including that of Vinod Kumar, and was in-charge of LeT’s Nepal module for a long time. “He was responsible for recruitment of cadres providing financial and logistics support and facilitating movement of LeT operatives across the Indo-Nepal border. He used the alias of Vinod while operating in Nepal,” a dossier on him says.He returned to Pakistan after carrying out jihadi activities in India and started working with LeT’s chief accountant Yaqub and started fundraising for Jamaat-ud-Dawah and Lashkar. Gradually, he started overseeing recruitment at the launchpads as well, sources said.He had settled in Balochistan with his wife. Of late, he had been working closely with Hamas functionaries and fundraising for Gaza and Palestine.On June 1, 2006, three terrorists—Afzal Ahmad Butt, Abu Al Kalam Alad and Usman Habib—were killed while attempting to attack the RSS headquarters in Nagpur.The attack on a CRPF camp in Rampur on Jan 1, 2008, had resulted in the death of seven jawans of the paramilitary forces and a civilian.The attack on Indian Institute of Science in Bengaluru took place on Dec 28, 2005.

BHUBANESWAR: A 21-year-old YouTuber from Puri is being investigated on suspicion of collaborating with Haryana travel blogger Jyoti Malhotra, who was arrested Saturday for allegedly spying for Pakistan. The unnamed woman came under the scanner after it emerged that she had travelled to Kartarpur Corridor, a visa-free border crossing leading to Gurdwara Sri Darbar Sahib , shortly after Jyoti’s visit to Jagannath Temple in Puri on Sept 21 last year.“Haryana Police and other security agencies are in touch with us. We have questioned the YouTuber and shared details with them,” Puri SP Vinit Agrawal said.The content creator’s parents said they were confident she was innocent, but would cooperate with security agencies as “India comes first and our daughter second”. Police sources said Jyoti, who stayed for three days in Puri, met her fellow YouTuber during the trip. The Puri woman said her friendship with Jyoti started online around eight months ago after the duo bonded over their shared love of travel vlogging.“Had I known her alleged anti-national activities , I would not have struck a friendship with her. I am ready to face questioning by any agency,” she was quoted as telling interrogators. SP Agrawal said investigators hadn’t found any incriminating detail about Jyoti’s Odisha visit and her interactions with the Puri vlogger.The woman’s father said his daughter and Jyoti were “merely” friends. “My daughter has no involvement in anti-national activities and was unaware of Jyoti’s alleged espionage. Since she loves travelling, she made a pilgrimage to Kartarpur with another friend (not Jyoti) three months ago. She received official permission to visit the place,” he said.","A 21-year-old YouTuber from Puri is being investigated on suspicion of collaborating with Haryana travel blogger Jyoti Malhotra.

A protest against the anti-conversion law. Eleven states have such laws, but there has been little by way of assessing their impact

Religious conversions have always been a fraught issue in India. Even as the Supreme Court is set to hear pleas challenging anti-conversion laws , the process has already become punishment for some. Not only have they been forced to spend time and resources defending themselves in conversion cases but continue to live in fear even after being acquitted.Two years ago, one sweltering Sunday morning in June, 35-year-old Sonu Saroj’s life turned upside down. The bike mechanic, who lives in Kodra village in UP’s Rae Bareilly, was conducting a Christian prayer meeting in a makeshift shed with several relatives and neighbours when about 35-40 people armed with sticks and claiming to be from the Vishwa Hindu Parishad attacked the group. “They just kept hitting us,” Saroj recalls. Some of them also ransacked his house. His wife sustained head injuries and fainted while his bleeding nephew and he were dragged to the police station.“We kept pleading with the police that we were the victims not the culprits, but no one listened to us,” he says. He was later booked under the UP anti-conversion law or the Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Act, 2021 (an amended, more stringent version of the 2020 ordinance). It took multiple visits and witness accounts following which Saroj was cleared of all charges by a local court in Sept 2024. Though free at least, Saroj is too scared to hold prayer gatherings.Eleven states, including Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, UP and Karnataka, have anti-conversion laws and several other states are planning to have them. In both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, where such laws already exist, the administration has announced more stringent versions with MP even planning to introduce death penalty as punishment. Yet, there has been little by way of assessing the impact of these legislations.An estimated 835 cases were registered in UP with 1,682 arrested between Nov 2020 and July 2024 under the anti-conversion law. Just days after the anti-conversion law was passed in UP in Nov 2020, the first person to be booked was Muzaffarnagar resident Nadeem, accused of “trapping” a married woman and converting her. A case of ‘love jihad’ was filed by her husband who had employed Nadeem for work.It later emerged that her husband was riled up by the fact that his wife sought shelter at Nadeem’s house after a fight between the couple. “It was a domestic dispute that was turned into a fake conversion case against me,” Nadeem says. “I had no support, and no one believed me. I was humiliated, called names. It took me over a year to get out of that mess,” Nadeem says. He was acquitted by the Allahabad high court in Jan 2021. “Aaj bhi jail ke baare mein soch ke rooh kamp jaati hai (Just the thought of prison sends shivers down my spine even today),” says the 29-year-old.In Chhattisgarh’s Mokhpal village, it took over a dozen Christian residents, who were beaten and their belongings destroyed, seven years to overthrow conversion allegations. Dantewada resident Sangeeta Kartami and her husband were part of a group who would gather to pray every Sunday at Mokhpal, 32 km from her home. On Oct 15, 2017, Kartami remembers the group had finished their prayers and most people had already left when a large mob attacked them with sticks. “I was hit on the head with a lathi and suddenly felt blood pouring out. I don’t remember much after that,” she says.Her husband Dev Chandra was hauled off to the Dantewada police station. Like Rae Bareilly’s Saroj, Kartami found then that they had been charged under the anti-conversion law. So began the seven-year journey.Looking back at why they were targeted, Kartami says there is a prevalence of superstition and black magic in their community. “My husband, a govt school teacher, was not doing well. But in 2003, he accepted Christianity and started progressing both in his work and personal life. After that, he was frequently accused of converting people even when he was sharing a word of comfort or advice,” she says.The same year as the Dantewada couple, Maharashtra resident Prabhakar Sule, 47, who lives in Jalgaon district, was booked in an anti-conversion case. He was visiting MP’s Khandwa for a prayer meeting when the group was attacked. “My wife and I were dragged to the police station like criminals. My children, who live in hostels, had no idea of our whereabouts for three days,” he says.Sule’s case was registered in Khandwa, 120 km away from his home. For seven years, the couple had to travel for court appearances before they were cleared in 2024. “Earlier, I was scared at the sight of khaki but now I don’t feel that dread anymore. The worst has already happened,” he says.","Eleven states, including Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, UP and Karnataka, have anti- conversion laws.

In a bizarre and frightening mid-air incident, a Germany to Spain Lufthansa plane, carrying nearly 200 passengers, flew for 10 minutes without any pilot as the first officer lost consciousness and the captain was in the washroom.

Before that, he remembered flying over Zaragoza and, the next thing, he was being attended to by the cabin crew and a doctor,” the report said.“The loss of consciousness was so sudden that he was unable to warn the other crew members of his incapacitation.”As the captain took control over the plane, he diverted it to Madid which was the closest airport at that time. The first officer was taken to a hospital where doctors said his sudden and severe incapacitation was a result of a neurological condition.

Former US President Joe Biden diagnosed with 'aggressive' prostate cancer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/former-us-president-joe-biden-diagnosed-with-aggressive-prostate-cancer/articleshow/121254769.cms,"



Former US President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with prostate cancer , his office announced on Sunday.His diagnosis follows recent medical checks that revealed a worrying development.Biden was seen by doctors earlier this week after showing urinary symptoms . A routine physical exam had uncovered a small nodule in his prostate, prompting further tests. By Friday, doctors confirmed the presence of prostate cancer, with cells having already spread to his bones.“While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management,"" his office said in a statement. ""The President and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians.”Prostate cancers are rated with a Gleason score from 1 to 10, showing how abnormal the cancer cells look compared to healthy ones. Biden’s score of 9 means his cancer is very aggressive.Earlier this week, both ABC News and The New York Times reported that Biden had undergone a medical evaluation following the discovery of the prostate nodule. According to the NYT, he spent Friday in a Philadelphia hospital undergoing additional examinations.“This 82-year-old former US President Joe Biden is undergoing medical evaluation after doctors discovered a small nodule in his prostate during a routine physical exam,” a spokesperson told ABC News on Tuesday.Biden’s medical history has often drawn public attention, particularly during and after his presidency. In February 2023, while still in office, he had a lesion removed from his chest. White House physician Dr Kevin O’Connor later confirmed it was basal cell carcinoma . “All cancerous tissue was successfully removed. … No further treatment is required,” O’Connor said at the time.He explained that although basal cell carcinoma usually does not spread like other skin cancers, it can grow larger if left untreated. “They do, however, have the potential to increase in size, resulting in a more significant issue as well as increased challenges for surgical removal.”Before taking office, Biden also underwent Mohs surgery to remove non-melanoma skin cancers. In 2023, O’Connor noted that the biopsy site had “healed nicely” and added that Biden would continue with regular skin check-ups.Despite being declared “fit for duty” by O’Connor as recently as February 2024, Biden continued to face public doubts about his age and mental clarity. These concerns were widely believed to have influenced his decision to step away from the 2024 re-election race.Since leaving office in January, Biden has kept a relatively low profile but has appeared in the media a few times, including interviews after US President Trump’s first 100 days back in the White House.","Biden was seen by doctors earlier this week after showing urinary symptoms. A routine physical exam had uncovered a small nodule in his prostate, prompting further tests. By Friday, doctors confirmed the presence of prostate cancer, with cells having already spread to his bones.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121254800,imgsize-821716,width-400,resizemode-4/121254800.jpg"

The Casanova Killer’s violent legacy and cross-state crimes

O.J. Simpson connection still fuels debate

Glen Rogers, a convicted murderer long suspected of multiple cross-country killings and once linked to the O.J. Simpson case, was executed in Florida on Thursday evening. The 62-year-old was put to death by lethal injection at Florida State Prison near Starke for the 1995 murder of Tina Marie Cribbs, a mother of two, whose body was found in a Tampa motel room.Often referred to by media as the “Casanova Killer” or “Cross Country Killer,” Glen Rogers developed notoriety for a string of violent crimes in the mid-1990s. In addition to his Florida conviction, he was also sentenced to death in California for the strangulation of Sandra Gallagher, another mother he reportedly met at a bar in Van Nuys. That killing occurred just weeks before Cribbs’ murder.Rogers’ crimes spanned several states and captured national attention, especially after his arrest in Kentucky following a high-speed chase in a car belonging to Cribbs. Though Rogers once boasted to law enforcement that he had murdered approximately 70 people, he later retracted that claim. However, the scope and brutality of his crimes led to extensive media coverage, books, and documentaries, including the 2012 film My Brother the Serial Killer, which raised questions about his possible involvement in other unsolved cases.One of the most controversial aspects of Rogers’ story is his alleged—but unproven—connection to the infamous 1994 murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman. The theory gained traction after the release of the 2012 documentary, which featured Rogers’ brother, Clay, and a criminal profiler. Speculation suggested Rogers may have been responsible for the double murder for which O.J. Simpson was later acquitted.However, law enforcement quickly dismissed the claims. “We know who killed Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman. We have no reason to believe that Mr. Rogers was involved,” the LAPD said in a public statement following the documentary’s release.Before his execution, Rogers made a brief, unsettling statement. “In the near future, your questions will be answered,” he said, without elaboration. He then added, “President Trump, keep making America great. I’m ready to go,” and remained calm as the procedure began.Also Read: O.J. Simpson’s mistress took explosive secrets to the grave that could have changed the murder trial No family members of Tina Cribbs attended or spoke publicly after the execution. Rogers leaves behind a dark legacy as one of the most notorious serial offenders of his time, with many questions about his past still unanswered.","Glen Rogers, 62, was executed in Florida on Thursday evening.

Ashoka University’s faculty association calls professor’s arrest ‘calculated harassment’

What did the prof write?

What were the objections?

What was the prof’s counter?

What are the charges in FIRs?

What do complainants say?





GURGAON: Days after the state women’s commission summoned him, and he clarified that his comments had been completely misunderstood, Ashoka University associate professor Ali Khan Mahmudabad was arrested on Sunday and charged with, among other things, endangering India’s sovereignty, unity and integrity for his comments on Operation Sindoor.The basis for the FIR that was filed at Rai police station in Sonipat, where the leading liberal arts and sciences university is located, was a complaint from Haryana State Women’s Commission chairperson Renu Bhatia On May 13, Bhatia had dispatched the summons to Mahmudabad. A day later, when he skipped appearing before the panel, saying it had no jurisdiction in the matter, she promised followup action.While DCP (crime) Narender Singh confirmed the arrest was related to the FIR filed on Bhatia’s complaint, a second FIR was filed at the same police station against Mahmudabad on Sunday. The complainant in the other case is Yogesh Jatheri , the sarpanch of Jatheri village and a general secretary of BJP’s Yuva Morcha. According to police, Jatheri’s and Bhatia’s complaints were unrelated.The professor, the son of ‘Raja of Mahmudabad’ Mohd Amir Mohd Khan ‘Suleiman’, is an MPhil in history and a PhD in social sciences from Cambridge, and heads Ashoka’s political science department.He was taken into custody by a Haryana Police team from his residence in Delhi on Sunday morning and produced in a Sonipat court, which remanded him in police custody for two days.The next hearing is scheduled at 2pm on May 20.Ashoka University’s faculty association stood behind Mahmudabad, calling the arrest “calculated harassment”. “The faculty association of Ashoka University strongly condemns the arrest of Prof Mahmudabad on groundless and untenable charges. We condemn the calculated harassment to which he has been subjected: after being arrested early in the morning from his home in New Delhi, he was taken to Sonipat, not allowed access to necessary medication, and driven around for hours without any communication about his whereabouts. The faculty association stands in full support of our colleague — an invaluable member of the university community, a beloved and respected teacher and friend to his students, and a deeply responsible citizen, who brings all his energy and learning to promoting communal harmony and the greater good.”In the notice to Mahmudabad, the Bhatia-led panel had characterised his social media post of May 9 as an attempt to “malign national military efforts and sow communal divisions”. Referring to his observations on the press briefings during the military operation by Col Sophiya Qureshi and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh, the panel alleged they disparaged women in the armed forces.Mahmudabad had on May 14 clarified that what he had written in his May 9 post “solely express concern over the rhetorical excesses and reckless warmongering exhibited by certain sections of the civilian public”. In the long post, Mahmudabad made the point that it’s the poor who suffered from war while “politicians and defence companies” benefitted from it. “There are those who are mindlessly advocating for a war but they have never seen one let alone lived in or visited a conflict zone,” he wrote.On Col Qureshi and Wing Commander Singh, he had written in his May 9 post that he was “very happy to see so many right-wing commentators applauding” the Indian Army officer, but “perhaps they can equally loudly demand that victims of mob lynchings, arbitrary bulldozing… are protected as Indian citizens”. “The optics of two women soldiers presenting their findings is important, but optics must translate to reality on the ground, otherwise it’s just hypocrisy,” he wrote.In its notice, the women’s panel objected to his use of terms like “genocide”, “hypocrisy” and “dehumanisation”. “There is also a misrepresentation of facts surrounding India’s counter-terror operations, framed in a way that may encourage unrest or civil disturbance, a violation of women’s dignity by indirectly questioning their role and legitimacy in military service, and a breach of ethical guidelines for university faculty under UGC Regulations, 2018,” the notice read.There were no comments from anyone representing Mahmudabad on Sunday. In his reaction to the commission’s May 14 summons, he had said, “The summons issued to me fail to highlight how my post is contrary to the rights of or laws for women. Contrary to the allegations, my post appreciated the fact that the armed forces chose Colonel Sophiya Qureshi and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh for the press conference to highlight the fact that the dream of the founders of our Republic, of an India which is united in its diversity, is still very much alive. I even applauded members of the right wing who supported Col Qureshi and invited them to have the same attitude for common Indian Muslims who face demonisation and persecution on a daily basis. If anything, my entire comments were about safeguarding the lives of both citizens and soldiers.”In the FIR filed on Bhatia’s complaint, police invoked sections 152 (acts that endanger India’s sovereignty, unity and integrity), 353 (statements conducing to public mischief) and 79 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman).The FIR filed on Jatheri’s complaint invoked section 196 (promoting enmity between different groups), 197 (imputations and assertions that could be prejudicial to national integration), 152 and 299 (deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs).DCP (crime) Singh said, “There were two complaints, one by Renu Bhatia regarding the Facebook post and disregarding the commission’s summons, and the other by a sarpanch which stated that the professor had said things to him.”Asked about her complaint, Bhatia told TOI on Sunday, “We do not accept anybody speaking inappropriately about any woman, let alone a woman in uniform being insulted. We visited the university on May 15 as Prof Ali did not appear before the commission on May 14. The university told us he was not there. By the time the commission could proceed, Prof Ali was believed to have been sent away. University officials, including the registrar and vice-chancellor, did not speak about the matter, which further annoyed the commission. ” She said she had filed the police complaint on May 15.When TOI asked Jatheri what his complaint was about, he said, “The matter is of serious nature. I have filed a complaint for the comments he made against me.” Asked what these specific comments were, Jatheri again said they were “serious” but refused to elaborate.",Haryana State Women’s Commission chairperson Renu Bhatia and BJP Yuva Morcha general secretary Yogesh Jatheri filed separate FIRs.

LUCKNOW: The Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) on Sunday arrested a suspected Pakistani spy for allegedly working for Pakistan's intelligence agency and engaging in cross-border smuggling from Moradabad.According to UP ATS officials, credible information was received indicating that a man operating along the India–Pakistan border was involved in smuggling activities and was being supported by Pakistani intelligence operatives. Upon further investigation, ATS identified the suspect as Shehzad Wahab , a resident of House No. 135, Mohalla Azad Nagar, Tanda, in Rampur district.

""Under the guise of trade, he allegedly maintained direct contact with Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) operatives and provided them with sensitive information related to India's internal security,"" a senior ATS officer said.The officer added that Shehzad shared classified information with ISI agents and also facilitated financial transactions for Pakistani handlers operating in India. He helped to transfer money to ISI-linked individuals in India.Moreover, Shehzad is suspected of recruiting individuals from Rampur and other parts of UP, sending them to Pakistan under pretext of smuggling or employment, with the ultimate aim of assisting the ISI. Pakistani intelligence handlers reportedly arranged the visas and other travel documents for these individuals, the officer added.Shehzad also allegedly supplied Indian SIM cards to ISI agents to aid in their espionage activities, the officer said. Based on the collected evidence, the ATS registered an FIR at the ATS police station in Lucknow under relevant sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), including charges related to espionage and national security.

Years of conflict and rising militancy in Borno





In one of the deadliest attacks in Nigeria’s Borno, at least 57 people were killed and over 70 reported missing after militants linked to Boko Haram 's Jama'atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda'awati wal-Jihad (JAS) faction attacked two villages on Thursday.Eyewitnesses said that militants stormed the neighbouring villages of Mallam Karamti and Kwatandashi, gathering more than 100 residents and forcing them into the surrounding bush, news agency AP reported.According to locals, 57 bodies were recovered by Saturday, many with their throats slit, while others had been shot.Witnesses also said the victims’ burial was delayed due to the military’s unavailability to assist in the search for bodies.A spokesperson for the Borno state government said that they could not confirm the exact casualty figures, while the Nigerian military has yet to respond to requests for comment.The villagers were accused of being informants for the rival Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP). While ISWAP is known for attacking military targets, the JAS faction has increasingly focused on civilians and suspected collaborators, relying on robberies and kidnappings for ransom.""Without the capacity to attack the military like ISWAP, JAS is focused on terrorizing civilians,"" said Malik Samuel, a conflict expert with the nonprofit Good Governance Africa The mass killing occurred during a surge of violence in Borno state. On Monday, ISWAP militants launched a deadly assault on the Nigerian Army’s 50 Task Force Battalion in Marte, killing several soldiers and seizing weapons and ammunition.Following this, displaced residents in Marte fled to Dikwa, a key humanitarian hub. However, aid organizations are now withdrawing from the area due to international funding cuts.In a separate incident on Saturday afternoon, a roadside bomb exploded along the Maiduguri-Damboa road, the second such attack in a week which killed 4 people and injured 10 others.Three people died at the scene, and a fourth succumbed to injuries Sunday morning at the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital (UMTH). More than 10 others were still being treated for injuries at the hospital, a local resident, Lawan Bukar Maigana, who has assisted the community in emergencies, said.Since 2009, the Boko Haram insurgency has caused over 35,000 deaths and displaced 2.6 million people across Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger, and Chad, with Borno remaining the worst affected.The insurgents aim to establish an all Islamic state across these four countries, with Nigeria—West Africa’s most populous nation and oil powerhouse—as their primary target.The Nigerian government has claimed progress against the insurgency, but the militants continue to attack civilians and military and have expanded into other regions, including central Nigeria where the capital Abuja is located, according to experts and public records on counterterrorism.While the Nigerian government claims it has made progress in combating the insurgency, militant attacks continue against both civilians and security forces.","Militants linked to Boko Haram attacked two villages in Nigeria's Borno state.

A 25-year-old man the FBI believes was responsible for an explosion that ripped through a Southern California fertility clinic left behind ""anti-pro-life"" writings before carrying out an attack investigators called terrorism , authorities said Sunday. Guy Edward Bartkus of Twentynine Palms, California, was identified by the FBI as the suspect in the apparent car bomb detonation Saturday that damaged the clinic in the upscale city of Palm Springs in the desert east of Los Angeles. His writings seemed to indicate anti-natalist views, which hold that people should not continue to procreate, authorities said.The blast gutted the American Reproductive Centers fertility clinic and shattered the windows of nearby buildings along a palm tree-lined street. Witnesses described a loud boom followed by a chaotic scene, with people screaming in terror and glass strewn along the sidewalk and street.Investigators said Barktus died in the blast, which a senior FBI official called possibly the ""largest bombing scene that we've had in Southern California.""

‘He killed himself’: FBI chiefs Kash Patel and Dan Bongino insist Jeffry Epstein died by suicide,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/he-killed-himself-fbi-chiefs-kash-patel-and-dan-bongino-insist-jeffry-epstein-died-by-suicide/articleshow/121258536.cms,"File photo: FBI director Kash Patel (right) and deputy director Dan Bongino (Picture credit: X/@FBIDDBongino)

'WAVE OF TRANSPARENCY': FBI director hints at agency's move to rebuild Americans' trust





FBI director Kash Patel and deputy director Dan Bongino have firmly asserted that Jeffrey Epstein ’s death in a Manhattan jail cell in 2019 was a suicide, pushing back against persistent conspiracy theories that he was murdered to protect powerful individuals.Their comments came during a joint appearance on Fox News’ Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo.“He killed himself,” Bongino said plainly during the interview. “I’ve seen the whole file. He killed himself.” Patel backed this view, saying, “As someone who’s been a public defender, a prosecutor, who’s been in that prison system, you know a suicide when you see one, and that’s what that was.”He acknowledged sceptics have a right to their opinion but insisted there was no foul play.Bongino reiterated his stance on X, writing: “I have reviewed the case. Jeffrey Epstein killed himself. There’s no evidence in the case file indicating otherwise. If new evidence surfaces, I’m happy to reevaluate.”Epstein was found hanged in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center on August 10, 2019, a month after his arrest on sex trafficking charges.His death was ruled a suicide by New York City’s chief medical examiner.However, two guards on duty reportedly fell asleep and failed to check on him, and the hallway surveillance cameras had malfunctioned, a combination that fuelled public suspicion.Adding to the controversy, Epstein’s family hired forensic pathologist Dr Michael Baden, who concluded Epstein’s neck injuries suggested homicide. “The fractures were more consistent with strangulation,” he argued.However, Dr Barbara Sampson, the city’s medical examiner at the time, countered, “The cause is hanging, the manner is suicide. I stand firmly behind our determination.”The speculation around Epstein’s death was further stoked in February after US attorney general Pam Bondi released a batch of Epstein-related documents.As per Fox News, the files contained little more than contact information and did not reveal any so-called “client list,” prompting backlash from Republican lawmakers.Rep Anna Paulina Luna called the release “a complete disappointment,” demanding the full information be made public.Bondi later said that after pressuring the DOJ, she received “a truckload of evidence” from the Southern District of New York. She promised a full FBI report was coming, though none has been released yet.The Epstein case resurfaced in headlines recently after the death of Virginia Giuffre , one of his most prominent accusers.As per The New York Times, Giuffre died by suicide at her farm in Western Australia in April.She had sued Britain’s Prince Andrew in 2021, accusing him of sexually abusing her when she was a minor, a claim he denied but later settled privately.Giuffre had played a central role in publicly exposing Epstein’s crimes. In 2015, she gave up her anonymity and was quoted by The Mail on Sunday, “Basically, I was training to be a prostitute for him and his friends.”She said she was recruited at age 16 by Ghislaine Maxwell , who was later convicted of sex trafficking in 2021 and sentenced to 20 years in prison.During the interview, Bongino and Patel also hinted that more revelations related to FBI investigations were forthcoming. Patel alleged that former FBI leadership “withheld and hid documentation” related to several high-profile probes. “Just give us about a week or two,” he added, suggesting a new wave of transparency may be imminent.","FBI director Kash Patel and deputy director Dan Bongino firmly asserted that Jeffrey Epstein’s death in a Manhattan jail cell in 2019 was a suicide.

Israel will allow a ""basic amount"" of food into the Gaza Strip, the prime minister office announced Sunday. This decision came following growing international pressure to ease a total blockade that has been in place for more than two months.The announcement was made hours after the military launched ""extensive ground operations"" as part of an intensified campaign in Gaza. It also coincided with ongoing indirect talks between Israel and Hamas aimed at possible ceasefire.Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's office said that following a military recommendation, ""Israel will authorise the entry of a basic amount of food for the population to ensure that a hunger crisis does not develop in the Gaza Strip"".Hunger crisis could undermine army's operation and Israel would take steps to prevent Hamas from seizing the humanitarian aid.Israel has imposed a blockade since 2 March with an aim to pressurize the Palestinian militant group. However, UN agencies have warned of severe shortage of food, clean water, fuel and medicines.Last week, US President Donald Trump , a key ally of Israel said, ""a lot of people are starving"" promising ""we're going to get that taken care of"".French foreign minister Jean-Noel Barro requested Israel to allow the ""immediate, massive and unhampered"" flow of aid following the recent announcement.On Sunday, Israel military announced that their army had ""begun extensive ground operations throughout the northern and southern Gaza Strip"", and they were ""currently being deployed in key positions"".The campaign launched by Israel, aimed at freeing hostages and defeating Hamas, began Saturday as both sides entered indirect talks in Qatar over a possible deal.Netanyahu’s office said that negotiators in Doha are 'working to exhaust every possibility for a deal -- whether according to the Witkoff framework or as part of ending the fighting.”Steve Witkoff is the US Middle East envoy involved in the discussions.Netanyahu asserted that the deal ""would include the release of all the hostages, the exile of Hamas terrorists, and the disarmament of the Gaza Strip"".Since a two-month ceasefire ended in March, Israel resumed its offensive negotiations mediated by Qatar, Egypt and the United States and have failed to reach a breakthrough.Netanyahu has opposed ending the war without the complete defeat of Hamas while Hamas has refused to disarm.According to A Hamas source, they were willing ""to release all Israeli hostages in one batch, provided that a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire agreement is reached"", but Israel ""wants to release its prisoners in one batch or in two batches in exchange for a temporary truce"".Israeli army chief Eyal Zamir told troops in Gaza on Sunday that the military would “provide flexibility to the political echelon to advance any hostage deal.”“A hostage deal is not a halt, it is an achievement. We are actively working toward it,” he added.On Sunday afternoon, air raid sirens sounded in southern Israel. The army said that one of two projectiles launched from Gaza had been intercepted.The military later issued evacuation orders for several parts of Gaza ahead of an attack, warning it would “launch a powerful strike on any area used for launching rockets.”Gaza civil defense spokesman Mahmud Bassal said that at least 50 people had been killed by Sunday afternoon ""as a result of ongoing Israeli air strikes since the early hours"", as reported by AFP.He added, ""22 people died and at least 100 others were injured in one strike on tents sheltering displaced Palestinians in Al-Mawasi, southern Gaza Strip.""In a statement, the military said that a “preliminary wave” of strikes over the past week had targeted “over 670 Hamas terror sites throughout the Gaza Strip.”Marwan al-Hams, director of field hospitals at Gaza's health ministry, said that since Israel's aid blockade began, ""57 children have died in Gaza as a result of famine"", adding the number could rise if supplies ran out.The health ministry accused Israel of surrendering the Indonesian Hospital in Beit Lahia, cutting off access and ""effectively forcing the hospital out of service,"" leaving the northern region without a functioning public hospital.Gaza's health ministry said Sunday at least 3,193 people have been killed since Israel resumed strikes on March 18, taking the war's overall toll to 53,339.","Israel will allow a ""basic amount"" of food into the Gaza Strip, the prime minister office announced Sunday.

Poll Do you believe the bombing at the fertility clinic was an act of terrorism? Yes No

Several eyewitness accounts capture aftermath of large explosion near Palm Springs, California





A powerful bomb exploded outside a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, on Saturday, killing one person and injuring at least four others in what the FBI has officially declared an act of terrorism.“This is an intentional act of terrorism,” said Akil Davis, the head of the FBI’s Los Angeles field office, during a press briefing near the site. He added, “This is probably one of the largest bombing investigations that we've had in Southern California.”The explosion ripped through downtown Palm Springs around 11 am (local time), blowing out windows across several blocks and collapsing part of the American Reproductive Centers building.Authorities believe the blast originated from a vehicle in or near the clinic’s parking lot. A charred car axle was all that remained at the scene. Davis confirmed the deceased was near the blast but did not release their identity, citing the need to protect the investigation.According to AP, officials believe the person killed may have been the perpetrator.An AK-47-style rifle was also recovered from the site.While the motive remains unclear, Davis said the clinic “was deliberately targeted.” The FBI has not specified whether the act was domestic or international terrorism.Authorities are also investigating whether the explosion was livestreamed.The clinic confirmed that all staff are safe and that its laboratory, which stores embryos and reproductive materials, was not damaged. “Thank God today happened to be a day that we have no patients,” Dr Maher Abdallah, who leads the clinic, was quoted as saying by AP.The force of the blast was immense, scattering debris across a five-lane street and damaging nearby buildings, including a liquor store and a hospital. As per The New York Times, one witness said the car parts were “blown clear across four lanes.”Palm Springs police chief Andy Mills assured residents that the bombing was an isolated incident and there was no ongoing threat. However, as a precaution, Planned Parenthood closed 19 centres across Southern California.US attorney general Pam Bondi condemned the attack in a statement posted online, calling it “unforgivable,” and adding, “The Trump administration understands that women and mothers are the heartbeat of America.”The Center for Reproductive Rights called the bombing “horrific” and demanded stronger protections for clinics, stating that patients must “feel safe.”Investigators from the FBI, ATF and local agencies remain at the scene, collecting evidence in what could become a landmark terrorism case in California.","A bomb exploded outside a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, on Saturday, killing one person and injuring at least four others.

Who is Tiffany Slaton? Woman who survived 24 days lost in Sierra Mountains by living on wild leeks and snow,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-tiffany-slaton-woman-who-survived-24-days-lost-in-sierra-mountains-by-living-on-wild-leeks-and-snow/articleshow/121241792.cms,"(Source: X)





A 28-year-old woman from Georgia who went missing in California's Sierra Nevada mountains has stunned authorities and her family with a survival story described as “movie-worthy,"" reports the New York Times. Tiffany Slaton , a travelling dialysis technician and outdoors lover from Jeffersonville, Georgia, has been found safe after surviving 24 days alone in the snowy mountains of California.Slaton's journey began as a short three-day solo camping trip near Shaver and Huntington Lakes, but later turned into a fight for survival that took her more than 40 miles off track, all the way to Vermilion Valley Resort During her time in the wild, Tiffany faced 13 snowstorms, an avalanche, and a serious fall from a cliff. She lost her tent, her bike, and most of her supplies.The journey started on April 20 and soon became very tough. Slaton took her electric bike and camping gear, including two sleeping bags and a tent. Early on, she fell off a cliff and was unconscious for about two hours. When she woke up, she made a splint for one leg and “popped the other knee back into place,” NBC News reports.She had no signal and her phone’s map didn’t work.She tried calling 911 five times, but none went through. At one point, she even asked her phone where the nearest Starbucks was; it said 18 miles away.Her family reported her missing on April 29, and a large-scale search followed, covering roughly 600 square miles. Local authorities and volunteers collectively travelled over 4,000 miles on foot and by vehicle. A helicopter was also deployed, but no trace of her was found until this week.Slaton stayed alive by eating wild leeks and boiling snow for water. She also made tea each day using pine needles and manzanita. To keep herself calm, she wrote in a journal every day.She finally reached Vermilion Valley Resort, hidden deep in the Sierra mountains and often cut off by snow. The cabin she found was unlocked, and the resort owner keeps it that way in case lost hikers need a place to stay.“I thought I had somehow managed to make it to the North Pole,” Slaton said, describing the moment she saw the cabin. Inside, she found a sleeping bag, which she called “the best sleeping bag I had ever seen.”The next day, just before her 28th birthday, the resort owner came. The roads had only just been cleared. “She pops out, didn’t say a word, just ran up, and all she wanted was a hug,” he said. “That’s when I realised who this was.”“She said, ‘Dad, I’m alive, and I’m sorry,’” her father Bobby was quoted as saying to NBC News. “Those prayers were answered.”Fresno County Sheriff John Zanoni called her tale one “they would make movies about.” His colleague Tony Botti added, “She’s a fighter. She’s not going to give up.”","Tiffany Slaton, 28, from Georgia, went missing in California's Sierra Nevada mountains on April 29.

Push for sanctions

'Root causes'





WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump will hold a phone call with Russia's Vladimir Putin on Monday as part of his long-running effort to end the war set off by Moscow's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.Trump had vowed during the US election campaign to halt the conflict within a day of taking office, but his diplomatic efforts have so far yielded little progress.Delegations from Russia and Ukraine held direct negotiations in Istanbul last week for the first time in almost three years, but the talks ended without a commitment to a ceasefire.Both sides traded insults, with Ukraine accusing Moscow of sending a ""dummy"" delegation of low-ranking officials.After the negotiations, Trump announced that he would speak by phone with the Russian president in a bid to end the ""bloodbath"" in Ukraine, which has destroyed large swathes of the country and displaced millions of people.Trump also said he would speak to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and NATO officials, expressing hope that a ""ceasefire will take place, and this very violent war... will end"".Since taking office in January, Trump has repeatedly stressed that he wants to see an end to the conflict, and has recently backed calls for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire.So far, he has mainly focused on upping the pressure on Ukraine and abstained from criticising Putin.Both Moscow and Washington have previously stressed the need for a meeting on the conflict between Putin and Trump.The US president has also argued that ""nothing's going to happen"" on the conflict until he meets Putin face-to-face.At the talks in Istanbul, which were also attended by US officials, Russia and Ukraine agreed to exchange 1,000 prisoners each and trade ideas on a possible truce, but with no concrete commitment.Ukraine's top negotiator, Defence Minister Rustem Umerov, said that the ""next step"" would be a meeting between Putin and Zelensky.Russia said it had taken note of the request.""We consider it possible, but only as a result of the work and upon achieving certain results in the form of an agreement between the two sides,"" the Kremlin's spokesperson said.Ukraine's western allies have since accused Putin of deliberately ignoring calls for a ceasefire and pushed for fresh sanctions against Russia.The leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Italy held a phone call with Trump on Sunday.""Looking ahead to President Trump's call with President Putin tomorrow, the leaders discussed the need for an unconditional ceasefire and for President Putin to take peace talks seriously,"" said a spokesman for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.""They also discussed the use of sanctions if Russia failed to engage seriously in a ceasefire and peace talks,"" the spokesman said.Zelensky also discussed possible sanctions with US Vice President JD Vance when they met after Pope Leo's inaugural mass at the Vatican on Sunday.""We discussed the talks in Istanbul, where the Russians sent a low-level delegation with no decision-making powers,"" Zelensky wrote on Telegram following the meeting.""We also touched on the need for sanctions against Russia, bilateral trade, defence cooperation, the situation on the battlefield and the future exchange of prisoners.""A senior Ukrainian official from the president's office, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told AFP that they had also discussed preparations for Monday's telephone conversation between Trump and Putin.It was the first meeting between Zelensky and Vance since their heated White House exchange in February.In the Oval Office, Vance publicly accused Zelensky of being ""disrespectful"" towards Trump, who told the Ukrainian leader he should be more grateful and that he had no ""cards"" to play in negotiations with Russia.Ukraine on Sunday said that Russia had launched a record number of drones at the country overnight, targeting various regions, including the capital Kyiv, where a woman was killed.Another man was killed in the southeastern Kherson region, where a railway station and private houses and cars were hit.In an interview with Russian state TV published on Sunday, Putin said that Moscow's aim was to ""eliminate the causes that triggered this crisis, create the conditions for a lasting peace and guarantee Russia's security"", without elaborating further.Russia's references to the ""root causes"" of the conflict typically refer to grievances with Kyiv and the West that Moscow has put forward as justification for launching the invasion in February 2022.They include pledges to ""de-Nazify"" and demilitarise Ukraine, protect Russian speakers in the country's east, push back against NATO expansion and stop Ukraine's westward geopolitical drift.However, Kyiv and the West say that Russia's invasion is an imperial-style land grab.",US President Donald Trump will hold a phone call with Russia's Vladimir Putin on Monday. The call is part of his long-running effort to end the war set off by Moscow's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Delegations from Russia and Ukraine held direct negotiations in Istanbul last week for the first time in almost three years.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121258127,imgsize-162584,width-400,resizemode-4/121258127.jpg"

BREAKING: Biden diagnosed with ‘aggressive’ prostate cancer





Leaders from across the political spectrum have come together in support of former US President Joe Biden after his office announced on Sunday that he has been diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer.The 82-year-old was diagnosed on Friday following tests that found a prostate nodule.The cancer has metastasized to the bone and carries a Gleason score of 9, indicating one of the most severe forms. However, the cancer is hormone-sensitive, which allows for “effective management,” his office said in a statement.The announcement prompted a rare moment of unity in American politics, as tributes and well-wishes flooded in from Republicans and Democrats alike.“Melania and I are saddened to hear about Joe Biden’s recent medical diagnosis. We extend our warmest and best wishes to Jill and the family, and we wish Joe a fast and successful recovery,” US President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social.Former US Vice President Kamala Harris expressed her support on X, writing, “Joe is a fighter — and I know he will face this challenge with the same strength, resilience, and optimism that have always defined his life and leadership.”Former US President Barack Obama, under whom Biden served as vice president, said via social media, “Nobody has done more to find breakthrough treatments for cancer in all its forms than Joe, and I am certain he will fight this challenge with his trademark resolve and grace.”Republican lawmakers also extended their support. “This is certainly sad news,” said house speaker Mike Johnson, adding that he and his family were praying for Biden.Georgia Rep Marjorie Taylor Greene, whose father died of cancer in 2021, wrote, “Prayers for Joe Biden and his family.”Democratic leaders joined in with heartfelt tributes. Former house speaker Nancy Pelosi said Biden is “a great American patriot” and that she and her husband Paul were “praying for him to have strength and a swift recovery.”California Governor Gavin Newsom said, “A man of dignity, strength, and compassion like his deserves to live a long and beautiful life.”Senator Tim Kaine said Americans would be “with them every step of the way.”Public figures also offered personal reflections. Meghan McCain, whose father Senator John McCain died from brain cancer, wrote, “Cancer is the absolute worst... I don’t believe times like these are appropriate for politics.”Former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton added, “I’m thinking of the Bidens as they take on cancer, a disease they’ve done so much to try to spare other families from.”Piers Morgan took aim at social media users mocking Biden’s condition, writing, “Show some bloody respect.”Former Biden spokesperson TJ Ducklo, who is also battling cancer, tweeted, “Cancer has no f***ing idea who it’s dealing with. Betting against Biden has never been and still remains a bad f***ing bet.”Several others—Senators Susan Collins, Thom Tillis, Mike Lee, Peter Welch, John Fetterman; Governors Wes Moore and JB Pritzker; and Representatives Ro Khanna, Shontel Brown, Eric Swalwell, Jasmine Crockett, Chuck Edwards and more—offered their thoughts and prayers.Biden's diagnosis comes after he experienced urinary symptoms. The cancer’s aggressive nature, Grade Group 5 with bone metastasis, means it’s “very treatable, but not curable,” news agency AP quoted Dr Matthew Smith of Massachusetts General Brigham Cancer Center, as saying.Biden is reportedly reviewing treatment options with his physicians.Biden’s fight against cancer has been personal. His son Beau died of brain cancer in 2015. In 2022, Biden relaunched the “cancer moonshot” with the goal of halving cancer deaths over the next 25 years.","Former US President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer.
