Days after his return from Ukraine , PM Narendra Modi briefed US President Joe Biden about his landmark visit to Kyiv, reiterating India’s “consistent” position in favour of dialogue and diplomacy and expressing full support for early return of peace and stability. During the conversation initiated by Biden, the leaders also shared concern over the situation in Bangladesh and emphasised restoration of law and order, along with the need to ensure safety and security of the minorities, particularly Hindus , according to an Indian readout.The conversation took place ahead of a possible bilateral meeting between the leaders, and a proposed Quad summit, next month in New York on the sidelines of the upcoming UNGA session. Modi and Biden also committed to strengthening Quad cooperation.The rare mention of security for Hindus in Bangladesh in a conversation with a foreign leader is in line with India’s stated priority of ensuring their safety in the crisis-ridden country. In his congratulatory message on X to Bangladesh Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus, Modi had called for protection of the Hindu community. However, Yunus later told him a phone conversation that reports of attacks on minorities are exaggerated.“We had a detailed exchange of views on various regional and global issues, including the situation in Ukraine. I reiterated India’s full support for early return of peace and stability. We also discussed the situation in Bangladesh and stressed on the need for early restoration of normalcy, and ensuring the safety and security of minorities, especially Hindus, in Bangladesh,” said Modi in a post on X.The talks on the Ukraine issue are also significant as Modi’s visit to Kyiv followed an outrage in the Western world, led by the US, over the timing of the visit. The US was upset that it was timed with the NATO summit in Washington. That Modi chose Russia for his first bilateral visit in his third term, and a Russian attack on a children hospital the day Modi landed in Moscow, only exacerbated this sentiment. There was no dramatic shift in India’s position though as Modi expressed solidarity with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy but also told him he needed to talk to Russia for early return of peace. India maintains it’s important to involve Russia for enduring peace. White House has described Modi’s visit as “potentially helpful”.“PM conveyed his appreciation for President Biden’s deep commitment the India-US Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership, which is based on shared values of democracy, rule of law and strong people-to-people ties,” said the Indian readout.The leaders , it added, reviewed the significant progress in bilateral relations and highlighted that India-US partnership is aimed at benefiting the people of both countries as well as the entire humanity.",PM Narendra Modi briefed US President Joe Biden about his landmark visit to Kyiv.

Russian-born tech entrepreneur Pavel Durov , the man dubbed the "" Russian Zuckerberg "" for his creation of the VKontakte (VK) social network and Telegram messaging service, was arrested at a Paris airport this weekend. The 39-year-old faces legal challenges in France over alleged criminal activities linked to Telegram, including fraud, drug trafficking, cyberbullying, and promoting terrorism.Durov, who shot to fame in his twenties with VKontakte, a social network that outpaced Facebook in the former USSR, has long been a polarizing figure, reported Reuters.His refusal to comply with Russian authorities led to his departure from VKontakte in 2014 and the subsequent launch of Telegram. The messaging service, known for its strong encryption and stance against censorship, quickly gained global popularity but has faced criticism for allegedly hosting extreme content.Durov's unconventional behavior includes a 2012 stunt where he showered high-denomination notes on pedestrians from VKontakte's headquarters. A self-declared libertarian, he champions internet confidentiality and refuses to moderate content on Telegram, further complicating his relationship with global authorities.Durov’s recent arrest follows a French warrant targeting him for various offences reportedly linked to activities on Telegram. The French gendarmerie's cyber unit and the national anti-fraud office are handling the case. Durov, who settled in Dubai and later acquired French nationality, remains in police custody.In addition to his business ventures, Durov has made headlines for personal claims, including reportedly boasting about fathering over 100 children through sperm donations. Despite his fortune, estimated at $15.5 billion by Forbes, his cryptocurrency, toncoin, has seen a significant decline following news of his arrest.Telegram’s role in global issues, including Russia’s war against Ukraine, has drawn attention. The platform's channels are used by both pro-Moscow and anti-Moscow factions, highlighting its controversial influence in geopolitical matters.As Durov’s legal battles continue, the future of Telegram and its controversial role in the digital age remain uncertain. Durov’s ongoing legal issues and the platform’s contentious position in global politics could have lasting impacts on both his fortune and the messaging service’s reputation.","Russian-born tech entrepreneur Pavel Durov was arrested at a Paris airport this weekend.

The arrest is linked to an investigation into Telegram’s alleged failure to moderate content. Elon Musk, the American tech mogul and owner of X (formerly Twitter), quickly reacted to the news on his social media platform.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112773594,imgsize-931992,width-400,resizemode-4/112773594.jpg"

Kerala govt feels the heat as Mollywood scandal widens

KOCHI: The flood of revelations about sexual assault and harassment in Malayalam film industry following the release of a redacted version of the Justice K Hema Committee report last week continued Monday, with more women professionals coming out with accounts of mistreatment from their male counterparts. As many as eight Mollywood bigwigs, including actor and CPM legislator M Mukesh, faced allegations from junior actors and technicians.Ernakulam police lodged an FIR against director Ranjith based on a complaint from a Bengali actor who raised charges of sexual misconduct against him dating back to 2009.Ranjith had stepped down as chairman of state-run Kerala Chalachitra Academy. The case has been filed as a non-bailable offence.Others who faced allegations included Baburaj, joint secretary of Association of Malayalam Movie Artists, directors Sreekumar Menon and Thulasidas, and actors Jayasurya, Shine Tom Chacko, Edavela Babu and Maniyanpillai Raju.Actor Minu Muneer joined the chorus of claims, revealing that a 16-year-old girl and her mother were sexually assaulted for two weeks on the sets of a 2008 movie directed by Bipin Prabhakar. It starred Prithviraj Sukumaran and Bhama in lead roles and Mammootty in a cameo role.Much of the spotlight was on Mukesh. The accusations against the two-time CPM MLA put the Left govt under pressure. Yuva Morcha and Mahila Congress took out marches to his residence in Kollam, demanding a case against him and his resignation. Some others, like writer Sara Joseph and Chalachitra Academy vice-chairman Premkumar, objected to Mukesh's reported inclusion in a committee of a cinema conclave planned by govt.Mukesh has not responded to the charges. An actor who appeared in few movies levelled the allegations in a Facebook post against Mukesh, Jayasoorya, Maniyanpilla Raju and Idavela Babu and a few others. ""In 2013, I was subjected to physical and verbal abuse by these individuals while working on a project. I was forced to leave the Malayalam film industry and relocate to Chennai. I am now seeking justice and accountability,"" the actor wrote.Later, sharing details of her ordeal with the media, she said Mukesh and Jayasurya tried to sexually assault her on the sets of movies while AMMA former general secretary Idavela Babu misbehaved with her at his flat, where she went to complete formalities for association membership. Maniyan Pillai Raju misbehaved with her while travelling in a car, she said.A junior artist said Baburaj & director Sreekumar Menon sexually assaulted her at a house in Aluva and a hotel in Ernakulam, respectively. She also alleged that Shine Tom Chacko asked some people to arrange a meeting with her for a role in a movie featuring him. A well-known actor in the 1990s, meanwhile, alleged that director Thulasidas misbehaved with her over the phone and knocked on her door at a film's set in 1991. The filmmaker has denied the charges.Responding to the claims, Raju demanded detailed investigations. Baburaj backed the calls for a probe while terming the allegations part of an attempt by vested interests to prevent him from becoming AMMA general secretary, replacing actor Siddique who resigned Sunday amid similar charges.","As many as eight Mollywood bigwigs, including actor and CPM legislator M Mukesh, faced allegations from junior actors and technicians.

Tropical Storm Hone: Hawaii faces flooding and road closures as three Cyclones stir in Pacific,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hawaii-faces-flooding-and-road-closures-as-three-cyclones-stir-in-pacific/articleshow/112821416.cms,"Tropical storm Hone brings heavy rain to Hawaii

Impact on Big Island

Precautions against future fires amid Tropical Storm Hone

Hurricane Gilma and Tropical Storm Hector gain strength

Three tropical cyclones were active in the Pacific Ocean on Monday, bringing varied effects to different regions. Tropical Storm Hone caused significant rainfall and flash floods in Hawaii , while Hurricane Gilma and Tropical Storm Hector were gaining strength and moving eastward.The impacts of these storms led to road closures and power outages to potential future flooding concerns.Tropical Storm Hone, pronounced ""hoe-NEH,"" caused road closures, downed power lines, and damaged trees in parts of the Big Island , according to William Ahue, a forecaster at the Central Pacific Hurricane Center in Honolulu. As of midday Monday, Hone was located 280 miles west-southwest of Honolulu, with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph, moving west at 13 mph.""No major damage that we know of yet,"" news agency AP quoted Big Island mayor Mitch Roth as saying. ""No injuries that we know of at this point.""One family had to be evacuated on Sunday due to flooding, Roth added. Additionally, four schools on the Big Island were closed because of power outages and flooded roads. Hawaiian Electric reported that the utility restored power to most customers who had experienced outages. State transportation officials warned thatHilo airport might experience increased traffic due to added flights to compensate for weekend cancellations.Julia Neal, owner of a bed-and-breakfast on a former sugar plantation in Pahala on the Big Island, described her experience. ""We were experiencing tropical storm winds and heavy pounding rain through the night."" She noted that while the storm was disruptive, it was also beneficial for the area. ""Hone was also a gift in a way because we have been experiencing a lot of drought .""On Sunday, floods closed Highway 11 between Kona and Hilo, as well as an alternative higher-altitude route, the Cane Road, isolating properties such as the Aikane Plantation Coffee Co. Phil Becker, the owner of the coffee plantation, recounted the extent of the flooding.""We've got quite a lot of flood damage, the gulches are running full speed ahead and they're overflowing the bridges, so we're trapped down here, we can't get in or out,"" he said.Becker, who runs his plantation off the grid with solar-powered batteries, emphasised that his family was safe and had no need to evacuate. He also mentioned the potential benefits of the rainfall. ""We've been in a drought situation so the coffee is probably loving all this rain,"" he said.Hone, whose name means ""sweet and soft"" in Hawaiian, reminded residents of last year's devastating wildfires on Maui. The fires, fueled by hurricane-force winds, ravaged the historic town of Lahaina, resulting in 102 deaths. The Maui blaze, which occurred on August 8, 2023, became the deadliest US wildfire in over a century. Dry and overgrown grasses, coupled with drought conditions, significantly contributed to the spread of the fire.The cause of the Lahaina blaze is still under investigation, but one possible factor is the ignition by bare electrical wires and leaning power poles that toppled in strong winds.In response to Tropical Storm Hone, Hawaiian Electric and the Kauai Island Utility Cooperative prepared to shut off power if necessary to prevent live, damaged power lines from starting fires. However, they later determined that such safety measures would not be needed as Hone moved past the islands.Meanwhile, in the eastern Pacific Ocean, Hurricane Gilma intensified into a strong Category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 110 mph. As of Monday, Gilma was located approximately 1,160 miles east of Hilo, Hawaii, and was moving west at 8 mph. The National Hurricane Center forecasted that Gilma would increase in forward speed but decrease in intensity as it approached the central Pacific basin on Tuesday.Farther to the east, Tropical Storm Hector also gained strength on Monday. Hector's top sustained winds reached 50 mph and the storm was centred about 1,125 miles west-southwest of Mexico's Baja peninsula, moving west-northwest at 10 mph.Despite these developments, Big Island Mayor Mitch Roth advised residents to remain vigilant. With the ground already saturated from recent rainfall, additional rain could pose further challenges.""It's never too early to start protecting your house,"" Roth said to AP.",Tropical Storm Hone caused significant rainfall and flash floods in Hawaii.

The Biden campaign, and more recently Harris’s, have both sought her support, while Trump’s camp has expressed confusion over Swift's potential alignment with Democrats.According to a source close to Swift’s entourage, the singer is “excited” about Harris’s presidential run. “Taylor was thrilled when Kamala Harris was named Vice President in 2020. It was a monumental moment for her to see a woman in such a high political position,” the insider was quoted as saying by the US Sun. “Now that Harris is running for president, Taylor is even more enthusiastic about the possibility of Harris becoming the first female President of the United States.”Swift’s endorsement is expected to be a significant boost for Harris’s campaign.

In 2024, the world continues to grapple with severe conflicts, political instability, and humanitarian crises, making certain regions extremely dangerous. Countries like Yemen, Afghanistan, and Sudan remain at the forefront of global concern due to ongoing conflicts that have devastated their populations and infrastructure.To explore and understand which countries face the highest levels of danger, we turn to the Global Peace Index (GPI) compiled by the Institute for Economics and Peace.The Global Peace Index (GPI) provides a critical measure of the safety and stability of nations, highlighting those most impacted by war, violence, and unrest. This non-profit organization annually evaluates 163 countries across 23 indicators, including internal conflicts, societal safety, and levels of militarization, providing a comprehensive assessment of global peace and security.The GPI provides invaluable insights into global peace and security, helping to identify the most dangerous countries while also shedding light on the root causes of instability. By understanding these factors, policymakers, researchers, and global citizens can work towards promoting peace and mitigating conflict. Here’s the list of the most dangerous countries in the world.With a 2024 GPI score of 3.397, Yemen continues to be one of the world's most dangerous countries. Since the onset of civil conflict in 2015, the nation has been plunged into chaos, with widespread famine, disease, and infrastructure collapse exacerbating the situation.The conflict, which started as an internal struggle, has been prolonged and intensified by the involvement of neighbouring countries, each backing different factions. This has only deepened the suffering of the Yemeni people, who face unimaginable hardships daily.Sudan remains one of the most dangerous countries globally, primarily due to ongoing conflicts in regions like Darfur, South Kordofan, and Blue Nile. In 2024, these conflicts resulted in over 3,000 deaths and displaced nearly 2 million people.The humanitarian crisis is severe, with frequent attacks on civilians by government forces, opposition groups, and militias. According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), approximately 14 million people in Sudan are in dire need of humanitarian aid.South Sudan, with a GPI score of 3.324, remains one of the world's most perilous countries due to ongoing civil conflict, ethnic violence, and political instability. Since gaining independence in 2011, the country has struggled to maintain peace and stability, with its citizens facing continuous threats from internal strife and external pressures.Afghanistan, with a 2024 GPI score of 3.294, continues to be one of the most dangerous countries worldwide. Decades of conflict, compounded by the Taliban's seizure of power in 2021, have left the nation in a state of constant instability.The risks of terrorism, kidnappings, and widespread violence remain high, making Afghanistan a focal point of international concern.Ukraine has witnessed a significant decline in safety and stability, particularly since the Russian invasion began in February 2022. By 2024, the conflict has claimed over 150,000 lives, with millions more displaced both internally and externally.The destruction of cities and critical infrastructure, including homes, schools, and hospitals, has created a humanitarian crisis of immense proportions.The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) continues to suffer from one of the deadliest conflicts in African history. The ongoing violence, which has spanned more than four and a half years, has resulted in more lives lost than any other conflict since World War II, according to the International Rescue Committee. The DRC remains a highly dangerous place, with widespread violence and instability threatening the lives of millions.In 2024, Russia's GPI score of 3.249 reflects the nation's increasing danger, exacerbated by the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. Internally, Russia faces significant challenges, including organized crime and corruption, which undermine law and order.Additionally, environmental concerns, such as industrial accidents and pollution, pose substantial health risks to the population.Since the onset of its civil war in 2011, Syria has been one of the world's most dangerous countries. The conflict has devastated infrastructure, leaving buildings, roads, hospitals, and schools in ruins.The humanitarian situation is dire, with over 13 million Syrians in need of assistance, including 6.6 million internally displaced. Food insecurity is rampant, and the healthcare system is in disarray, with many hospitals destroyed or operating at minimal capacity.Mali has been embroiled in armed conflict since January 2012, when Tuareg rebels seized control of the northern territory, declaring the independent nation of Azawad by April of that year. The situation escalated further with a military coup in March 2012, deepening the turmoil in the region. Today, Mali remains one of the most dangerous countries, with ongoing violence and instability threatening the safety of its citizens","In 2024, the world continues to grapple with severe conflicts, political instability, and humanitarian crises, making certain regions extremely dangerous.

The states accused the administration of bypassing Congress for ""blatant political purposes.""One of the states leading the challenge is Texas, which in the lawsuit claimed the state has had to pay tens of millions of dollars annually from health care to law enforcement because of immigrants living in the state without legal status.President Joe Biden announced the program in June. The court order, which lasts for two weeks but could be extended, comes one week after the Department of Homeland Security began accepting applications.""The claims are substantial and warrant closer consideration than the court has been able to afford to date,"" Barker wrote.Barker was appointed by former President Donald Trump in 2019 as a judge in Tyler, Texas, which lies in the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, a favored venue for advocates pushing conservative arguments.The judge laid out a timetable that could produce a decision shortly before the presidential electionNov. 5 or before a newly elected president takes office in January. Barker gave both sides until Oct. 10 to file briefs in the case.The policy offers spouses of U.S. citizens without legal status, who meet certain criteria, a path to citizenship by applying for a green card and staying in the U.S. while undergoing the process. Traditionally, the process could include a years-long wait outside of the U.S., causing what advocates equate to ""family separation.""The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately return an email seeking comment on the order.""The court's decision tonight to halt the federal government from providing relief is devastating to the thousands of Texas families that could have benefited from this program,"" Jessica Cisneros, an attorney for the advocacy organization the Texas Immigration Law Council, said Monday.Several families were notified of the receipt of their applications, according to attorneys advocating for eligible families who filed a motion to intervene earlier Monday.""Texas should not be able to decide the fate of hundreds of thousands of U.S. citizens and their immigrant spouses without confronting their reality,"" Karen Tumlin, the founder and director of Justice Action Center, said during the press conference before the order was issued.The program has been particularly contentious in an election year where immigration is one of the biggest issues, with many Republicans attacking the policy and contending it is essentially a form of amnesty for people who broke the law.Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton cheered the order.""This is just the first step. We are going to keep fighting for Texas, our country, and the rule of law,"" Paxton posted on the social media platform X.To be eligible for the program, immigrants must have lived continuously in the U.S. for at least 10 years, not pose a security threat or have a disqualifying criminal history, and have been married to a citizen by June 17 - the day before the program was announced.They must pay a $580 fee to apply and fill out a lengthy application, including an explanation of why they deserve humanitarian parole and a long list of supporting documents proving how long they have been in the country.If approved, applicants have three years to seek permanent residency. During that period, they can get work authorization.Before this program, it was complicated for people who were in the U.S. illegally to get a green card after marrying an American citizen. They can be required to return to their home country - often for years - and they always face the risk they may not be allowed back in.","The administrative stay issued by U.S. District Judge J.Campbell Barker comes just days after 16 states, led by Republican attorneys general, challenged the program. The states accused the administration of bypassing Congress for ""blatant political purposes"" The program could benefit an estimated 500,000 immigrants in the country.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112821191,imgsize-1233360,width-400,resizemode-4/112821191.jpg"
Large Indian-American turnout at Democratic convention in support of Kamala Harris,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/large-indian-american-turnout-at-democratic-convention-in-support-of-kamala-harris/articleshow/112821009.cms,"At the Democratic National Convention in Chicago last week, to celebrate US Vice President Kamala Harris as the presidential candidate of the Democratic Party , members of the Indian American community, including elected representatives of government, delegates who represented their states or districts and guests, were very visible and engaged.“There are over 700,000 eligible Indian Americans in the seven battleground states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.President Joe Biden won six of these seven states by a total of 325,000 votes in 2020. So, clearly Indian American voters matter,” Shekar Narasimhan, a 2024 DNC Virginia delegate and founder and chairman, Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Victory Fund, told the Times of India. He added that the Indian American community was well represented at the convention on the main stage every day, with over 30 delegates and 40 elected officials. “And the number of new convention attendees was remarkable especially second generation and younger,” Narasimhan said.Ajay Bhutoria, an Indian American community leader who is deeply engaged in the political and public advocacy space, feels that the involvement of the Indian diaspora in Kamala Harris’s campaign, as evident at the DNC, has been incredibly inspiring and impactful. “At the DNC, I witnessed a strong sense of pride and commitment among Indian Americans, who see Vice President Harris not just as a first Indian American presidential candidate but as a symbol of the American dream. From fundraising to organising voter outreach efforts, members of our community are playing critical roles in driving her campaign forward,” he told TOI. For him, the most memorable moment at the convention was congratulating Vice President Harris on her nomination right after her acceptance speech.The large presence of Indian Americans at the DNC is testament to the growing political engagement within the community, Bhutoria feels. “This presence reflects the widespread support for Harris's campaign among Indian Americans, who see her as a leader who understands the challenges and aspirations of immigrant communities. The enthusiasm at the convention was palpable, and it reinforced the belief that our community will be a decisive force in the upcoming election,” he said. Elected Indian American officials who were seen at the DNC included Congressional representatives Shri Thanedar and Raja Krishnamoorthy; Maryland’s Lt Governor Aruna Miller; Montgomery County Commissioner Neil Makhija, North Carolina State Senator Jay Chaudhuri; Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul, Illinois State Senator Ram Villivalam and many others.A large number of Indian American community members, especially second and third generation, were actively involved the Democratic convention this year and many of them are seen as playing an important role in Harris’s presidential campaign. Some of visible community members at DNC were Praveen Meyyan, an Asian American community leader who is chair of the Democratic Asians Americans of Virginia (AAPI Caucus of the Democratic Party of Virginia); Shyamali Roy Hauth, an US Air Force veteran who serves on the 11th Congressional district Democratic committee; Deepa Sharma, a lawyer and DNC delegate from California who has served on the executive board of the California Democratic Party’s Asian/ Pacific Islander caucus; Shivanthi Sathanandan, second vice chair, Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, and the battleground states director of SouthAsians for Harris and Harini Krishnan, co-national director of South Asians for Harris and delegate from California at DNC.“The number of DNC delegates and volunteers from the Indian American community has grown significantly, which reflects our community’s increasing political participation. This year, there was a concerted effort to engage and mobilise Indian American voters, and that was evident in the number of community members actively involved in the convention. Their presence and contributions are crucial as we work to ensure that our voices are heard and that we play a key role in shaping the future of our nation,” Bhutoria said.Chintan Patel, executive director of Indian American Impact Fund, an organisation dedicated to promoting and elevating the voices of Indian and South Asian Americans in the political and civic life of the United States, who attended DNC, said that his organisation looks forward to mobilising South Asian Americans in unprecedented numbers for Harris’s campaign. “We are confident that our community will help deliver the White House to Kamala Harris this November,” he said in a statement after the DNC.","The Indian American community was well represented at the convention on the main stage every day.

RFK JR: When RFK Jr's daughter who's hanging out with Ben Affleck told how her father beheaded dead whale,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/when-rfk-jrs-daughter-whos-hanging-out-with-ben-affleck-told-how-her-father-beheaded-dead-whale/articleshow/112817127.cms,"Both RFK Jr and his daughter Kick Kennedy are in news. And what connects them now, it seems, is a dead whale. Kick Kennedy is apparently the new pal of Ben Affleck recently divorced from Jennifer Lopez. And Kennedy Jr is in the news for suspending his campaign as the independent presidential candidate and then endorsing former president Donald Trump. With both the father-daughter in news, the Internet found out the most gruesome story where Kick described how during a childhood trip top Hyannis Port, her father beheaded a dead whale so that he could study at home.The incident took place in the mid-1990s when Kick was six year old and the family was holidaying.But as he got to know that a whale carcass had washed ashore on Squaw Island, Kennedy Jr got all excited and went to the beach with a chainsaw in hand. He beheaded it right then and then strapped the whale's head to the family minivan to bring it home for his further study.“Every time we accelerated on the highway, whale juice would pour into the windows of the car, and it was the rankest thing on the planet,” Kick told the Town & Country magazine in 2012.“We all had plastic bags over our heads with mouth holes cut out, and people on the highway were giving us the finger, but that was just normal day-to-day stuff for us.”Kennedy Jr had weird things going on with dead animals and he has been surprisingly candid about all these. Once he found a fatally hit bear cub early one morning. “So I pulled over and I picked up the bear and put him in the back of my van, because I was gonna skin the bear. It was in very good condition and I was gonna put the meat in my refrigerator,"" Kennedy said. But then he got distracted by his friends who suggested that they should get rid of the bear. Kennedy Jr actually dropped the dead bear cub in New York's Central Park. The 2014 incident made headlines but nobody knew it was Kennedy Jr and his gang.RFK Jr was also photographed with the barbecued skeleton of a four-footed animal which many called a dog but he said it was just a goat.","Kick Kennedy is apparently the new pal of Ben Affleck recently divorced from Jennifer Lopez.

Her point of disagreement with the Democrats was war as she denounced the party she served as an elitist cabal of warmongers.Tulsi Gabbard ran in the 2019 Democratic presidential primary against Kamala Harris.As Donald Trump welcomed Tulsi, he called her a true American patriot. ""A 17-year veteran of the Hawaii Army National Guard, a four-term Democrat Congress woman, very very popular...She was a very good candidate. Every time she ran, she did very good. She decided to leave because she could not take it anymore but she is very special. I didn't know she is Lt Colonel. That's not bad. Lt Colonel. I didn't know that. just found out and I said put it down. This is better than all other stuff I have read. But no, she is a special person.

""We can't be prosperous unless we are at peace and we can't be free as long as we have a government that is retaliating against its political opponents and undermining our civil liberties weaponizing our very institutions against those they deem as threat. Kamala Harris has done this in the last three years. She won't hesitate to do this if she's elected,"" Tulsi said.Tulsi joined Trump earlier in the day in paying respect to the soldiers martyred in the Abbey Gate Attack in Kabul.In his presidency, Trump did not start any war and took steps to de-escalate and prevent wars, Tulsi Gabbard said adding that he exercised the courage expected from the commander-in-chief.

US Presidential Elections: Trump's X-treme comeback: A two-hour rant with capital letters and catchy insults,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-x-treme-comeback-a-two-hour-rant-with-capital-letters-and-catchy-insults/articleshow/112815709.cms,"Former President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has returned to his glory by going on his longest post spree on X (formerly Twitter ) since January 6, 2021.In his dramatic return to X, Trump made six posts in just under two hours on Sunday, attacking the Democratic Party and its 2024 election candidate Vice President Kamala Harris on a range of issues.Trump was banned from the platform on January 6, 2021, following the Capitol riot for violating the app's terms and conditions after he posted 13 times in 10 hours, three of which he later deleted.However, when billionaire Elon Musk purchased the platform and rebranded it as X in 2022, Trump’s account was restored. Despite this, Trump has largely stayed away, preferring to communicate with his followers via his own platform, Truth Social—until now.Trump was posting campaign material on the site on August 12, but his Sunday posts were a return to his signature style.The first post appeared at 11:57 am ET, where Trump took aim at President Joe Biden and Vice President Harris over their handling of the escalating tensions in the Middle East. ""Who is negotiating for us in the Middle East?"" Trump asked. ""Bombs are dropping all over the place! Sleepy Joe is sleeping on a Beach in California, viciously Exiled by the Democrats, and Comrade Kamala is doing a campaign bus tour with Tampon Tim, her really bad V.P. Pick. Let's not have World War III, because that's where we're heading!""Trump followed up with a bold declaration just 11 minutes later: ""NOVEMBER 5TH WILL BE THE MOST IMPORTANT DAY IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICA!"" Clearly, he's all in on the 2024 election.At 1:06 pm, he went on the attack again accusing Harris of being a communist, ""There will be no future under Comrade Kamala Harris, because she will take us into a Nuclear World War III! She will never be respected by the Tyrants of the World!""Trump's posts reflected a familiar theme: his belief that global respect for the United States has waned since he left office. He has often boasted that his leadership kept adversaries like Russia in check, claiming that Russia would never have invaded Ukraine if he were still president.His admiration for authoritarian leaders like Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un has also been well documented, with Trump famously stating that he and Kim ""fell in love"" through their letter exchanges.Trump's attacks on Harris were not limited to foreign policy or political blame. He wrote ""Kamala and her 'handlers' are trying to make it sound like I am the Incumbent President, so that they can blame me for the failure of the past four years. No, it was their failure! It is one of the worst Presidencies in History, and she is definitely the Worst Vice President.""While Harris has spent most of her term as a relatively unpopular vice president, Trump's presidency was rated the worst in history by historians at the Presidential Greatness Project in 2024.At 1:51 pm, he claimed that Harris would decimate social security and Medicare, giving it away to ""Millions of Illegal Immigrants who are infiltrating our Country!""Minutes later, he warned that a Harris presidency would be disastrous for the economy, leading to Soviet-style price controls and crippling taxes. ""If you think things are expensive now, they will get 100 times WORSE if Kamala gets four years as President,"" Trump warned. ""If you want more CASH and less TAX, VOTE TRUMP!!!""In true Trump fashion, his posts were full of capital letters, catchy insults, and exaggerated claims. It looks like the former president is back to doing what he does best—riling up his supporters and taking shots at his rivals, one post at a time.","Trump was banned from the platform on January 6, 2021, following the Capitol riot for violating the app's terms and conditions.

Trump threatens to torpedo debate amid taunts of chickening out,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-threatens-to-torpedo-debate-amid-taunts-of-chickening-out/articleshow/112815348.cms,"WASHINGTON: The first and only scheduled Presidential debate on September 10 between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris is in jeopardy after Trump cast doubts on the integrity of ABC News , the network assigned to carry it, and the Harris campaign sought an ""open mic"" engagement.Surrogates of both candidates scorched the opposite side in statements and on social media, with the former President himself triggering the spat by suggesting he may bail out of the debate because in his view the network is anti-Trump and the engagement would be rigged to favor Harris.“Will panelist Donna Brazil give the questions to the Marxist Candidate like she did for Crooked Hillary Clinton? Will Kamala’s best friend, who heads up ABC, do likewise. Where is Liddle’ George Slopadopolus hanging out now? Will he be involved. They’ve got a lot of questions to answer!!!"" Trump said in one of trademark rants on ""Truth Social,"" his own platform.""I ask, why would I do the Debate against Kamala Harris on that network? ... Why did Harris turn down Fox, NBC, CBS, and even CNN? Stay tuned!!!” he added. Trump had initially agreed to debate Biden on ABC News, but sought to shift the engagement to Fox News, which favors him, when Harris replaced Biden as the Democratic nominee.Harris supporters meanwhile taunted Trump with numerous memes portraying him as a chicken, even as her aides sought a rule change to keep mics open and live during the debate.In the Trump-Biden debate that resulted in a debacle for the President, the Biden campaign wanted the mic of one candidate to be muted when the other spoke, ostensibly to prevent Trump from interrupting the President. That arrangement, which the Trump camp agreed to reluctantly, eventually worked out to Trump's advantage since he perforce had to be more restrained, and in the eyes of many observers, looked Presidential for a change.The Harris campaign now wants an open mic arrangement since they believe their candidate can manage Trump's interruptions and he (Trump) will self-destruct if he is allowed to speak unhindered.“We have told ABC and other networks seeking to host a possible October debate that we believe both candidates’ mics should be live throughout the full broadcast,” the Harris campaign said in a statement, adding, “Our understanding is that Trump’s handlers prefer the muted microphone because they don’t think their candidate can act presidential for 90 minutes on his own.”The Harris campaign and it partisans on the liberal spectrum believe Trump is a trainwreck if he allowed to speak unfettered. But Trump himself believes his style -- which disdains policy and details in favor of virulent ad hominem attacks full of falsehoods and distortions -- works for him. He has blown off senior Republican grandees who have urged him to focus on policy and who have argued that what will win him the elections.Still, Trump managed to upstage Democrats on Monday with what his supporters portrayed as a very presidential act of visiting the Arlington National Cemetery to honor 13 service members who died in the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal three years ago today.Trump has often blamed the Biden-Harris dispensation for the debacle, although it was during his Presidency that the Taliban was invited to Camp David and accorded recognition, undermining the then Ashraf Ghani government in Kabul and setting the stage for the US rout.Trump supporters accused Biden and Harris of ignoring the sacrifices of the US military while their supporters said the former President had consistently desecrated US military personnel by calling those who lost their lives ""suckers"" and ""losers,"" allegations Trump has denied.At least three senior US generals who worked with Trump during his time in the White House eventually parted ways with him saying he was unfit to be president. They are among more than three dozen Trump White House officials, including then vice-president Mike Pence, who have not endorsed him for the 2024 presidential elections.","The first and only scheduled Presidential debate on September 10 between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris is in jeopardy.

NYT Donald Trump Kamala Harris: Columnist Rich Lowry slammed for his 'how to go after Kamala Harris' suggestion in NYT,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/columnist-rich-lowry-slammed-for-his-how-to-go-after-kamala-harris-suggestion-on-nyt/articleshow/112814629.cms,"'Kamala Harris is weak and phony'

Rich Lowry came under Dem attack Monday for his New York Times column in which he said that Donald Trump can win on character as in not character assassination but what he has been doing so far -- questioning the ability.""Presidential races are won and lost on character as much as the issues, and often the issues are proxies for character. Not character in the sense of a candidate’s personal life, but the attributes that play into the question of whether someone is suited to the presidency — is he or she qualified, trustworthy and strong, and does he or she care about average Americans?"" Rich Lowry, the editor-in-chief of National Review wrote.Rich wrote that presidential races are deeply personal and it involved disqualifying the opponent more than convincing voters that the opponent's platform is not right. He cited the example of how the Obama team hammered Mitt Romney calling him 'heartless' 'out-of-touch capitalist' and all policy debates basically went back to this.Defending his argument, Rich wrote that Trump won't be going to beat Harris in debate over border or price controls. ""Everything has to be connected to the deeper case that Ms. Harris is weak, a phony, and doesn’t truly care about the country or the middle class. The scattershot Trump attacks on Harris need to be refocused on these character attributes,"" he wrote.""To wit: Ms. Harris was too weak to win the Democratic primary contest this year. She was too weak to keep from telling the left practically everything it wanted to hear when she ran in 2019. She is too weak to hold open town-hall events or do extensive — or, at the moment, any — sit-down media interviews.""There is plenty that Trump campaign can work to attack Kamala Harris not doing anything as the vice president, not addressing a press conference etc, Rich wrote making a case in point.""Of course, Mr. Trump doesn’t need much convincing to launch personal attacks. He said earlier this month that he feels “entitled” to them. But calling Ms. Harris dumb or questioning her racial identity does more to undermine him than her. The point isn’t to be gratuitously insulting, but to make a root-and-branch argument that she shouldn’t be — can’t be — president,"" he wrote.Commentator Keith Olbermann called Rich Lowry a piece of s****. ""People are hammering that Rich Lowry piece for the headline on ""Trump Can Win on Character,"" but it's even worse than you think: He means Trump can win by being Trumpy about Harris's character, and he thinks that's a good idea that would work and not shameful at all,"" another wrote.","Rich Lowry, the editor-in-chief of National Review wrote that presidential races are deeply personal and it involved disqualifying the opponent more than convincing voters that the opponent's platform is not right.

"US Presidential Elections: Ahead of debate, Donald Trump calls out bias in ABC news",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ahead-of-debate-donald-trump-calls-out-bias-in-abc-news/articleshow/112814309.cms,"Former President Donald Trump has expressed concerns regarding his upcoming debate with Vice President Kamala Harris , questioning his participation in the event scheduled for September 10 on ABC News. Trump highlighted what he believes is bias within ABC News and raised issues over various aspects of the debate.In a social media post on Sunday night, Trump expressed frustration over what he described as a ""ridiculous and biased interview"" of Senator Tom Cotton by ABC News reporter Jonathan Karl, and criticised the network's panel, which he believes is against him.Initially, Trump had agreed to face off against President Joe Biden on ABC News. However, following Biden's decision to end his campaign and Harris assuming the role of the Democratic nominee, Trump attempted to move the debate to Fox News but was eventually compelled to stick with the original arrangement. Despite some back-and-forth, Trump conceded to maintain the previously agreed-upon plan.In a social media post on Sunday, Trump questioned whether he should participate in the debate on ABC. He also took aim at Democratic strategist Donna Brazile, misspelling her name and accusing her of potentially favouring Harris, as well as using a disparaging nickname for ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos.Trump wrote, ""Will panelist Donna Brazil give the questions to the Marxist Candidate like she did for Crooked Hillary Clinton? Will Kamala's best friend, who heads up ABC, do likewise. Where is Liddle' George Slopadopolus hanging out now? Will he be involved?""Trump's criticism extended to the network choice, wondering why Harris declined debates on other major networks such as Fox News, NBC, CBS, and CNN.The debate negotiations have been contentious, with both campaigns clashing over dates, venues, and rules. Traditionally, the Commission on Presidential Debates has organised these forums in a standardised, nonpartisan manner. This year’s debates were arranged directly with the networks. The first debate between Trump and Biden was held on CNN on June 27, with the second scheduled on ABC News for September 10.Earlier, Trump briefly pulled out from the ABC debate but returned after Harris refused to move the event to Fox News. Currently, the Harris campaign is pushing for modifications to the debate rules. Initially, Biden had requested muted microphones when it wasn't a candidate's turn to speak. Yet, the Harris campaign is now advocating for microphones to remain live throughout the entire debate.Brian Fallon, a spokesperson for the Harris campaign, articulated that Trump's team preferred muted microphones because they were worried about his ability to sustain a presidential demeanor for the full duration of 90 minutes.""ABC offered the exact same debate rules as CNN, and we accepted -- as did the Harris camp,"" said Trump spokesperson Jason Miller. ""Now, after the Harris campaign has begun debate prep, they're clearly concerned about what they're seeing from Harris' performance and want a whole host of rules changes.""Despite Trump's objections, the debate moderators have been confirmed as ABC News anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis.","Former President Donald Trump has expressed concerns regarding his upcoming debate with Vice President Kamala Harris.

Sometimes it was his six children from two marriages and the shooting expenses and sometimes it was just his indecision. 2024 is a now or never moment for a desperate Bobby, Baldwin said.""His endorsement of Trump demonstrates his political cowardice. He has sold his political soul and desecrated the historic work and legacy of his father Robert and his uncle President John Kennedy,"" Baldwin wrote.""In 2006, when Bobby was 53 years old, New York State Attorney General Elliot Spitzer left office to run for Governor. Bobby Kennedy considered running for that office.""This position could have quickly led him to either the US Senate or Governor of New York and a potential path to the presidency.""He ultimately didn't run citing that his ""responsibilities to his six children from two marriages had left him with expenses that simply couldn’t be covered by a government salary.""There were other reasons.""In 2008, when Bobby was 54 years old, Hillary Clinton vacated her New York Senate seat to become Barack Obama's Secretary of State... this was another feasible path for Bobby to fulfill his presidential ambitions.""That didn't happen according to Bobby because... “I have spent lots of time thinking about it. I have spent time talking with my uncle, my brothers, my cousin and, of course, my wife. And I think I’m in a good position right now doing what I’m doing.” There were other reasons.""""Now, in 2024 at 70 years old, with the window of opportunity for his presidential aspirations closing, Bobby decides it's now or never. He takes some conspiratorial positions on COVID, vaccinations and Dr. Fauci which tapped into MAGA's frustration and anger with the pandemic, the economy, establishment politics, and the white majority sunsetting into the minority... which leads him to get into bed with Roger Stone, Mike Flynn, Steve Bannon... and ultimately Trump,"" Baldwin wrote in his long post.Kennedy's sister Kerry Kennedy was the most prominent in distancing her from his brother's new political stand, The five Kennedy siblings -- Kathleen, Courtney, Kerry, Chris and Rory -- issued a joint statement denouncing Kennedy Jr's endorsement of Trump. Kennedy Jr said he was aware of his very Democrat family's discomfort in his decision but he loves his family and was raised to love each other even when there are differences.","Baldwin said he has known Kennedy Jr for decades as they were friends, neighbors and shared a close bond in many ways including carpooling of their kids.

Should Elon Musk be 'nervous' after Telegram CEO's arrest?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/should-elon-musk-be-nervous-after-telegram-ceos-arrest/articleshow/112812456.cms,"Pavel Durov , the Russian-born founder and CEO of the popular messaging app Telegram, was arrested at Bourget airport near Paris on August 24, 2024, by French authorities. His arrest is part of a preliminary investigation focusing on the platform's alleged role in enabling criminal activity due to insufficient content moderation.Durov, who has long been a proponent of free speech and privacy, has faced scrutiny for Telegram's use in disseminating illegal content, which some argue poses significant challenges for law enforcement.Despite his recent arrest, he asserted that he has ""nothing to hide,"" and critics of the action argue that holding him accountable for the platform's content is misplaced. Telegram has grown remarkably since its launch, boasting over one billion users, and has become an important communication tool for various groups.Durov, who relocated from Russia in 2014 after clashing with authorities over user data privacy, now holds dual citizenship in the UAE and France. His legal troubles could have ramifications not just for Telegram but also for the way governments worldwide manage and regulate online platforms amid growing concerns over misinformation and misuse. The outcome of Durov's case may influence the operational practices of technology companies and their approach to user content.The circumstances of Durov's arrest have raised broader discussions about free speech, digital privacy, and the responsibilities of tech companies in moderating content. The arrest of the tech mogul, aged 39, led to a stern message from Moscow to Paris on Sunday, emphasizing the necessity of respecting his rights. Elon Musk , the proprietor of X, also expressed his disapproval, asserting that ""free speech in Europe was under attack.""But can Musk himself be arrested?Retired Lt Col Alexander Vindman issued a stark warning to Elon Musk on Sunday, suggesting that the tech billionaire should be ""nervous"" following the arrest of Telegram CEO .Vindman, a key witness in the impeachment trial against former President Donald Trump, took to X (formerly Twitter) to voice his support for the French authorities, stating, ""There’s a growing intolerance for platforming disinfo & malign influence & a growing appetite for accountability. Musk should be nervous.""Musk, on his part, has responded by defending Durov and expressing concern over what he perceives as government overreach, labeling the situation as ""dangerous times"" and promoting the hashtag #FreePavel.Prominent figures also weighed in on Durov’s arrest. RFK Jr condemned the French government's actions, saying, ""The need to protect free speech has never been more urgent."" Rumble CEO Chris Pavlovski and conservative commentator Ian Miles Cheong echoed these sentiments, arguing that the arrest is an attack on free speech and a move to control information.Writing in the Hill, Douglas MacKinnon , an opinion contributor, has expressed apprehension that Musk might be arrested.""As someone who pays close attention to the politics and the media in the United Kingdom and Europe, I began to notice a shocking narrative emanating from a growing number on the left there calling for the arrest of Elon Musk as well as the cancellation of X, the social media site he owns. Surely, I thought, these people can’t be serious. But they were — and are — deadly serious. For them, Musk and X have become public enemy number one,"" MacKinnon wrote.MacKinnon says that ""we live in increasingly perilous times"" and forces on the Left might move to cancel X and arrest Musk.""Could these forces on the left actually stop Musk? Could they arrest and imprison him? Could they cancel X and silence the voices of hundreds of millions of citizens around the world? I would not be so fast to say “no”, MacKinnon wrote.(With inputs from agencies)","Russian-born Pavel Durov was arrested at Bourget airport near Paris on August 24, 2024, by French authorities.

In several 'coordinated' attacks on Monday, at least 39 people were killed by militants in the troubled southwestern region of Pakistan .Armed assailants targeted and killed 23 passengers in the Musakhail district of Balochistan province after forcibly removing them from buses, vehicles, and trucks, according to police and news agency AP quoted official sources as saying.Gunmen shot at passengers after checking their identities.The attack, which ranks among the most lethal in the area, took place during the night in the Kusakhail district of Balochistan province. The perpetrators set fire to at least 10 vehicles before making their escape from the crime scene.In a separate incident, gunmen targeted individuals in the Qalat district, also in Balochistan, resulting in the loss of at least 10 lives. Among the victims were police officers and also civilians who were passing by when the attack occurred.In yet another incident, a rail line between Pakistan and Iran and a railway bridge connecting Quetta to the rest of the country were damaged in recent attacks involving explosives.Police said they had found six bodies that have yet to be identified, near the attack on the railway bridge.""We have confirmed 39 people killed in several coordinated attacks carried out by the BLA terrorists,"" Shahid Rind, a spokesman for the Balochistan provincial government was quoted as saying by AFP.The southwestern province faced more violence as insurgents carried out a series of attacks across different districts.Mohsin Naqvi, the interior minister of Pakistan, strongly condemned the attack, describing it as ""barbaric"" and assured that those responsible would face the full force of the law and not evade justice.The attacks came after separatist group Baluch Liberation Army warned people to stay away from highways, as they launched attacks on security forces in various parts of the province.Baloch seperatist elements in Baluchistan have a history of targeting workers and individuals from the eastern Punjab province, as part of their efforts to pressure them into leaving the region. Balochistan has been grappling with a low-intensity insurgency for many years.The majority of such previous killings have been attributed to the banned Baluchistan Liberation Army and other organizations seeking independence from the central government in Islamabad. Additionally, Islamic militant groups also maintain a presence in the province.In a similar attack in April, 11 labourers were killed when they were abducted from a bus in Naushki city of Balochistan.","Gunmen targeted and killed 23 passengers in the Musakhail district of Balochistan province.
