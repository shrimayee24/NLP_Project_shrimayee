They added that the operation is still underway.Security forces have been carrying out aggressive operations against terrorists in the hinterland, while the Army has been on maximum alert guarding the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir.Three hardcore Pakistani terrorists, including LeT commander Suleman Shah and his two associates Abu Hamza and Jibran, responsible for the Pahalgam attack, were killed on July 28 in the higher reaches of Dachigam National Park at the foot of the Mahadev mountain peak in the Harwan area of Srinagar.The Army code-named this operation Operation Mahadev. After the Pahalgam terror attack, the security forces have been carrying out anti-terrorist operations against gun-wielding terrorists, their overground workers (OGWs), and sympathisers.Drug smugglers and drug peddlers are also on the radar of the security forces, as it is believed that the funds generated by hawala money rackets and drug smuggling are used to sustain terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir.The coordinated and information-backed operations of the joint forces are aimed at dismantling the ecosystem of terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir, rather than focusing solely on the elimination of gun-wielding terrorists.","The gunfight broke out on Friday evening in the Akhal Khulsan forest area.

"Malegaon blast case: Judge showed concern over torture methods, detention",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/malegaon-blast-case-judge-showed-concern-over-torture-methods-detention/articleshow/123070485.cms,"MUMBAI: In the 1,036-page judgment in the Malegaon blast case , the judge found merit in allegations that the Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) had tortured witnesses and planted evidence. While the court dismissed torture claims from now- acquitted accused Pragya Thakur and Lt Col Prasad Purohit, it did find accused Sameer Kulkarni's claims of illegal detention to be credible.These findings against the agency echo those made by the Bombay high court in the 11/7 train blasts case judgment. The HC in its July 21 judgment discarded the evidence used to imprison 12 men for almost two decades. The HC also expressed serious doubts about the integrity of ATS's investigation methods. It held that confessions of the accused were a result of custodial torture. The court detailed brutal methods allegedly used by police to extract confessions, including, forcing individuals to split their legs 180 degrees, tying people to a chair all night, denying them food for long periods, placing cockroaches in vests and rats in underwear, along with severe beatings.The HC said, ""Not allowing a person to sleep, making him stand the whole night with his arms tied above his head, or stretching his legs to 180 degrees, as has been repeatedly testified to by the accused, will not leave visible scars on the body, no matter how much this may bruise the mind or injure the psyche.""In the Malegaon case, 39 of the 323 who resiled from their statements purportedly given to ATS too made allegations of torture.The NIA judge expressed concern about methods of torture and illegal detention adopted by ATS officers and raised questions about credibility of evidence collected. A witness claimed he was forcibly taken by ATS officers in Nashik and interrogated late into the night. He alleged the officers threatened him and pressured him to give a statement that aligned with their narrative. Feeling sick and fed up with the repeated calls and forceful detentions, he gave a statement as dictated by ATS. He said the facts in that statement are baseless and had filed a complaint against ATS officers with the human rights commission. The judge concluded, ""Thus, the possibility cannot be ruled out that his statement was recorded by browbeating and threatening him to face dire consequences. The testimony of this witness itself shows that his statement was involuntary and forceful. Such a statement cannot be relied upon.""The judgment also called for an inquiry into the actions of ATS officer Shekhar Bagade, whose presence at an accused's house under suspicious circumstances was noted. The accused, Sudhakar Chaturvedi, was acquitted on charges of assembling the bomb. ""Remnants of RDX which were found tilted towards the planting. Two Army officers testified that they had seen... Bagade in the house in suspicious circumstances holding one bag and carrying out some suspicious activities,"" the judge said. Similarly in the train blasts case, HC made observations on the importance of genuine justice. ""But creating a false appearance of having solved a case by presenting that the accused have been brought to justice gives a misleading sense of resolution.""",Court finds merit in allegations that the Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) had tortured witnesses and planted evidence.

NEW DELHI: A 15-year-old girl who suffered over 70% burn injuries on June 19 in Puri district of Odisha, succumbed on Saturday despite weeks of critical care.The teenager, initially treated at AIIMS Bhubaneswar, was airlifted to Delhi and admitted to the Burn ICU of the Burns and Plastic Surgery block, where she remained critical on oxygen support.

I pray for the eternal peace of the girl's soul and strength to her family.”The girl had initially alleged that she was attacked by three unidentified bike-borne men who poured kerosene on her and set her on fire. However, police officials said there was no evidence to support her claim. In her later statement before a judicial magistrate, she reportedly admitted to self-immolation.The incident occurred while the girl was on her way to a relative’s home and was allegedly abducted and taken to a secluded spot near the Bhargabi riverbank. Locals rescued her and alerted authorities.Police are still investigating the case, and the Odisha government had earlier announced it would cover her medical expenses.The case drew widespread attention and came shortly after another high-profile suicide case in Balasore, where a 20-year-old student ended her life alleging sexual harassment by a professor.","The teenager, initially treated at AIIMS Bhubaneswar, was airlifted to Delhi.

NEW DELHI: Arun Jaitley’s son, Rohan Jaitley, on Saturday rebutted Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s claim that the late Finance Minister had been sent to “threaten” him for opposing the Modi government’s now-repealed farm laws.Speaking at the Congress-organised Annual Legal Conclave 2025, Gandhi recalled a tense exchange, saying, “I remember when I was fighting against the farm laws, Arun Jaitley was sent to threaten me. He said, ‘If you continue down this path, opposing the government and fighting us on the farm laws, we’ll have to take action against you.’ I replied, ‘I think you don’t know who you’re talking to. We’re Congress people, we’re not cowards. We never bend. The British couldn’t bend us.’”Gandhi’s remark quickly drew a sharp rebuttal from Jaitley’s son, Rohan Jaitley, who accused the Congress MP of misrepresenting facts and politicising the memory of the deceased. “Rahul Gandhi now claims my late father, Arun Jaitley, threatened him over the farm laws. Let me remind him, my father passed away in 2019. The farm laws were introduced in 2020,” Rohan Jaitley said in a statement.Calling the claim factually incorrect and in poor taste, Rohan further added, “More importantly, it was not in my father’s nature to threaten anyone over an opposing view. He was a staunch democrat and always believed in building consensus.” He described his father’s approach to politics as one that welcomed open discussion rather than confrontation. “If at all such a situation was to occur, as it often does in politics, he would invite free and open discussions to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution to all. That was simply who he was and that remains his legacy today.”Rohan Jaitley also urged Gandhi to exercise caution while speaking about deceased public figures. “I would appreciate Rahul Gandhi being mindful while speaking of those not with us,” he said, recalling a previous instance where Gandhi had allegedly politicised the final days of former Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar. “He attempted something similar with Manohar Parrikar ji, politicising his final days, which was in equally poor taste. Let the departed rest in peace,” he added.Gandhi’s broader speech at the conclave included allegations of voter fraud in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, criticism of the Election Commission of India, and remarks about constitutional decline under the current government.","Rahul Gandhi said Arun Jaitley was sent to threaten him over farm laws.

Operation Akhal: Indian Forces Gun Down Terrorist In Kulgam Amid Rising Infiltration Attempts

NEW DELHI: The 'Janaza-Ghaib (funeral in absentia)' of Tahir Habib, one of the Pahalgam terrorists killed in Operation Mahadev in J&K, has been performed in his village in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir - a second confirmation that Pakistan was involved in the April 22 incident in which 26 civilians were killed.Videos and pictures posted on Telegram channels show the elderly of Khai Gala in Rawalkote gathering for the final prayers for the former Pakistan Army soldier and Lashkar-e-Taiba operative. But the funeral took an unexpected turn when local LeT commander Rizwan Hanif tried to be part of it. Tahir's family explicitly barred LeT members from attending the funeral but Hanif insisted, leading to a confrontation.Tahir's association with LeT and his role in the Pahalgam attack had made him a wanted category 'A' terrorist. His killing during Operation Mahadev in Srinagar last week along with two others was a major breakthrough for Indian security forces.During the funeral, a source said, ""Lashkar operatives threatened mourners with a gun, sparking outrage among villagers. The residents of Khai Gala, who have long been wary of radicalisation, are now planning a public boycott to oppose terror recruitment.""This development is significant as it not only highlights the growing resistance among POK residents against Pakistan's state-sponsored terror machine but also confirms that the impact of Operation Sindoor - conducted as a response to the Pahalgam attack - is being felt across the border.""A Lashkar commander facing public backlash and being forced to flee is a testament to the changing dynamics in the region,"" the source added.Tahir's past includes his association with the Islami Jamiat Talaba (IJT) and the Student Liberation Front (SLF) before joining the Pakistan army. The Sadozai Pathan community, to which Tahir belonged, has a rich history of resistance, having migrated from Afghanistan in the 18th century and playing a key role in the Poonch Rebellion. This also led to Tahir getting the alias of 'Afghani' with which he was known in intelligence records.","Tahir Habib, one of the Pahalgam terrorists killed in Operation Mahadev in J&K, has been performed in his village in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

Police responded with teargas and a lathi charge to disperse the crowd. No injuries or casualties have been reported so far.Police confirmed the youth who posted the content was not a permanent resident of Yavat. He had been staying with his grandmother for some time after moving from Nanded.The authorities are investigating his motive and whether there are any links to previous provocations in the area.A First Information Report (FIR) has been registered and the youth is currently in police custody.In view of the unrest, Section 144 has been imposed in Yavat village for 48 hours to prevent gatherings and maintain peace. Heavy police deployment, including teams from the State Reserve Police Force (SRPF), has been put in place. Senior officers from Pune Rural police are stationed in the area, ANI reported.“We are appealing to all citizens not to believe in rumours. Strict action will be taken against those trying to disturb communal harmony,” said SP (Pune Rural) Pankaj Deshmukh.CM Devendra Fadnavis also issued a strong statement: “Some people are deliberately trying to disturb peace by posting offensive content. No one has the right to insult any religion or belief. We will not tolerate such acts and strict action will be taken.”Deputy CM Ajit Pawar said, “The government is closely monitoring the situation. Section 144 has been imposed and the police have acted promptly. I appeal to people to cooperate and maintain peace.”Police said the situation in Yavat had already been sensitive due to a recent speech by local representatives and past incidents involving insults to historical icons. The combination of old tensions and the latest post appears to have contributed to Friday’s unrest.Authorities continue to monitor the situation. Internet services have not been suspended yet, but officials say that may be considered if misinformation continues to spread.",An allegedly objectionable WhatsApp post by a youth from another community sparked violence.

NEW DELHI: Heavy rains in Ghaziabad led to flooding in the girls’ hostel of ABES Engineering College on Wednesday night, with viral videos showing water gushing into rooms and corridors.The flooding caused significant damage to students' belongings, including clothes, books, documents, laptops and mobile phones.Several videos taken by students quickly spread on social media, showing soaked bedding and personal belongings scattered across rooms.The hostel corridors resembled shallow streams, with some students trying to protect their valuables. In some clips, students were seen climbing stairs as water gushed down rapidly, making the steps barely visible.Overnight rain disrupted daily life in parts of Ghaziabad, flooding basements of residential societies and the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) office. Despite the downpour, morning traffic was mostly unaffected as civic teams used dewatering pumps at 60 waterlogging spots, including UP Gate and Lal Kuan. The basement of the GDA office on Hapur Road, which stores many official files, was submerged under several feet of water.Although suction pumps were brought in quickly, hundreds of files were reportedly damaged before the water was cleared.The meteorological department has issued a fresh alert for Ghaziabad and nearby areas, warning of heavy rain, thunderstorms, and lightning until Friday.","Heavy rains in Ghaziabad led to flooding in the girls' hostel of ABES Engineering College on Wednesday night.

BAREILLY: An IAS officer, who once survived seven bullets after exposing a Rs 100-crore scam, was transferred within 36 hours of taking charge as sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) in Shahjahanpur's Powayan. The move came on Monday, hours after Rinku Singh Rahi hit the headlines once again - this time for performing sit-ups before a group of lawyers and cancelling two unpublicised land auctions.A video of the ""uthak-baithak"" was shared on social media. Rahi believes it may have cost him the post. Shahjahanpur DM Dharmendra Pratap Singh, however, told TOI, ""Rahi's transfer was initiated by the state govt and I have no idea about the precise reason behind it.""The auctions involved rights to village fish ponds and cattle shed land in Simra Viran. They were scheduled without public announcements, he said, a technical omission that could prevent fair bidding. ""More people deserve the chance to participate in such auctions. My decision may have upset some people,"" Rahi, a 2022 batch IAS officer, said.On the same day, he directed revenue officers to identify encroachments on govt land and issue notices.""If no notice is issued within 15 days, an FIR will be filed against the lekhpal concerned,"" he warned. He also planned to digitise tehsil-level records, including court proceedings and document submissions. ""People shouldn't have to file RTIs to get basic information,"" he said.After landing in the town for his latest posting, he proposed creating two WhatsApp groups in every village - one to allow residents to report absentee officials, and another to post complaints and their responses openly. ""I had already done this in Mathura as a provincial civil services officer. This is not innovation. This is basic administration.""But it was the sit-ups on Monday that drew public attention. After asking a clerk to do sit-ups for urinating in the open, Rahi himself performed sit-ups in front of lawyers at the tehsil premises after they pointed out filthy public toilets. ""I took responsibility because I was the senior-most officer. If seniors lead by example, systems improve,"" he said. Asked whether the video led to his transfer, he said, ""Could be. ""He added: ""I will serve wherever I'm posted. I'll not tolerate wrongdoing.""In 2008, as a provincial civil service officer in Muzaffarnagar, he exposed irregular transfers of social welfare funds. ""When I refused bribes and kept digging, I was warned,"" he said. On March 26, 2009, while playing badminton, he was shot in the face. The attack left him blind in one eye, with a bullet fragment lodged in his skull. ""I lost everything except the will to fight,"" he said.Four years later, in 2012, after being denied promotion, he staged a dharna outside the social welfare directorate in Lucknow. Police forcibly admitted him to a psychiatric facility. A decade later, he cleared the UPSC exam under the physically challenged category at age 40, secured all-India rank 683, and joined the 2022-batch IAS under the Persons with Benchmark Disabilities (PwBD) quota, UP cadre.His tenure in Shahjahanpur lasted less than two days. His plans, he said, were simple: open the system to scrutiny, restore accountability, and make governance participatory.","Rinku Singh Rahi was transferred within 36 hours of taking charge as sub- divisional magistrate (SDM) in Shahjahanpur's Powayan.

He had also suggested that India would get a good deal for its compliance.Trump's outburst on Truth Social on Wednesday conflicted with his claim of having frog marched India to cease Operation Sindoor by dangling the threat of stopping trade.Interestingly, the 'all things not good' admission from the US president, who has earned the reputation of being the global scold because of his petulance and pugnacity, came on a day when the two Houses of Parliament concluded a debate on Operation Sindoor that was dominated by Trump's claim of having mediated the suspension of hostilities.Also read: India-US trade deal: Donald Trump imposes 25% tariffs on India - top developments On Tuesday, PM Modi had refuted Trump's claim, saying no global leader had asked him to cease the offensive, and that it was the sheer ferocity of the IAF strikes on Pakistan's airbases that led Islamabad to sue for peace on May 10. That was getting as close as an Indian PM could get to accuse the US president of inexactitude.External affairs minister S Jaishankar went a step further on both Tuesday and Wednesday, stating that Trump and Modi did not talk between April 22 and June 16 when in a telephonic conversation, Modi had rebutted the suggestion that the operation against Pakistan was ceased because of anyone's mediation.In a significant decision, the Modi govt got foreign secretary Vikram Misri to let out details of the conversation.

A couple allegedly abandoned their 10-year-old son at the Barcelona Airport after discovering his passport had expired, choosing to board their flight home without him to avoid missing it, reported The Sun.A terminal worker who goes by the name of Lilian has posted a video on social media, criticizing the actions of the parents, garnering over 300,000 views. In her video, she claims that the parents reportedly arranged for a relative to pick their son up so that they could continue their journey.However, their unusual plan unraveled when airport staff discovered the boy alone and alerted the police, according to the air traffic coordinator.""He told them that his parents were on the plane on their way to their home country, going on vacation,"" Lilian said in her video, reported The Sun.""His passport in the country was expired, so the child was travelling with a Spanish passport but the Spanish passport needed a visa. As they did not have a visa, they left the child at the terminal and called a relative to come and pick him up,"" she added.Urgent contact was then made with the plane’s pilot, who then confirmed that the police had informed him about a minor in the car park.Eventually, the parents were located who were accompanied by another, younger child.“I’m an air traffic controller, and as a controller, I’ve seen a lot of things, but this has been completely surreal,” Lilian added, reported the New York Post.""How is it possible for parents to leave their ten-year-old son at the terminal because he cannot travel due to documentation issues? They call a relative but the relative may take half an hour, about an hour, about three hours and they take the flight so calmly and leave the child behind!"" Lililian said.""They saw it as very normal. Obviously I didn't see it as normal and the police didn't see it as normal either,"" she said.Lilian reported that airport police eventually removed the parents’ luggage from the flight and escorted them to the on-site police station for questioning.

Police ruled out any foul play or negligence on the part of Hersheypark's water park after a 9-year-old girl, Sophia Subedi, drowned on July 24. The theme park maintained proper safety standards, and there were enough lifeguards present at the pool at the time of the drowning. Bhutanese-origin Sophia Subedi was spotted in a state of distress in the wave pool at the Boardwalk at Hersheypark in Hershey, Pennsylvania.A lifeguard pulled her from the pool and performed CPR on her. She was taken to Milton S. Hershey Medical Center where she was pronounced dead.

They also said there were 10 lifeguards specifically dedicated to the wave pool at the time.After Subedi’s death, Derry Township Police launched an investigation, which included a review of video footage, statements from witnesses, employees and first responders, and documentation of the physical scene.On Friday, police said they finalized their review of the incident and determined that Subedi died from accidental freshwater drowning.There was no criminal activity involved and the safety standards at the theme park were also maintained. There was no overcrowding and the number of people in the wave pool was actually less than its designed maximum capacity.“It was also noted that nearby witnesses and lifeguards responded promptly, initiating rescue and resuscitation efforts within seconds of noticing Sophia's distress,” a Derry Township Police spokesperson wrote. “The Derry Township Police Department, along with the witnesses, Hersheypark staff, and first responders who attempted to save Sophia, extend their sincere condolences to her family and friends, as well as the Bhutanese community, during this difficult time.

Donning a head-to-toe yellow denim ensemble, influencer Tiffany Fong dropped a video recreating Sydney Sweeney and the controversial American Eagle ad. ""Handed down by my parents before me and their parents before them, my genes are yellow,"" Tiffany Fong said as she ate rice with chopsticks, calling it the Asian version of the American Eagle ad. There is no wordplay with genes and jeans here, as Tiffany Fong meant only jeans and not genes, unlike the American Eagle advertisement that is at the center of a major controversy.The row has drawn a political line as well, with MAGA leaders blaming the liberals for targeting the advertisement. “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color. My genes are blue,” Sydney Sweeney said in the viral advertisement, drawing flak for glorifying good genes.American Eagle defended the campaign, saying that it is only about jeans. “‘Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans’ is and always was about the jeans. Her jeans. Her story. We’ll continue to celebrate how everyone wears their AE jeans with confidence, their way,” the brand said without bowing down to the pressure.Vice president JD Vance commented on the controversy and said the liberals are attacking everyone who thinks Sydney Sweeney is beautiful.“And it’s like, you guys, did you learn nothing from the November 2024 election? Like I actually thought that one of the lessons they might take is we’re going to be less crazy. The lesson they have apparently taken is we’re going to attack people as Nazis for thinking Sydney Sweeney is beautiful. Great strategy, guys,” he added.“That’s how you’re going to win the midterm, especially young American men. Their course correction lasts about 30 seconds,” Vance said, adding that the Democrats have gone even crazier.While social media users are praising Tiffany Fong's video, she was recently in the news after a report said that she refused to bear Tesla CEO Elon Musk 's baby.","Influencer Tiffany Fong made a video recreating Sydney Sweeney and the controversial American Eagle ad.

Donald Trump’s obsession with Tom Brady’s personal life went beyond friendship

Tom Brady kept politics at arm’s length—for his family’s sake

While Tom Brady and Donald Trump once shared a famously close friendship, a series of behind-the-scenes revelations has cast new light on their dynamic—particularly during Brady’s highly publicized divorce from Gisele Bündchen in 2022. In a 2024 interview, Donald Trump consultant Sam Nunberg recalled how the president reportedly mocked the NFL star over the split, offering a surprising glimpse into how the former president viewed Brady’s personal life.Donald Trump’s connection to the New England Patriots and admiration for Brady was never a secret. The quarterback once referred to Donald Trump as a “good friend,” and a “Make America Great Again” hat famously appeared in Brady’s locker during the 2016 campaign. But according to Nunberg, Donald Trump’s remarks behind closed doors took a different tone after Brady’s marriage ended.Nunberg told Rolling Stone editor Jann Wenner that Donald Trump had a habit of comparing women in his inner circle—and Brady’s supermodel ex-wife Gisele Bündchen wasn’t spared.“Donald [Trump] would frequently say that Tom [Brady] knows that Melania is prettier than Gisele,” Nunberg claimed. “And he … did occasionally say, ‘Don’t you think Ivanka is prettier than Gisele?’”These remarks, while unsurprising to those familiar with Trump’s history of objectifying commentary, paint an unsettling picture of how the former president viewed his friends and their relationships—as status symbols and talking points.While Donald Trump publicly suggested that Brady had voted for him, the seven-time Super Bowl champion consistently tried to steer clear of political debates. He once shared, “I talked to my wife, and she said I can’t talk about politics anymore. I think that’s a good decision for our family.”This decision to pull away from politics, particularly during Trump’s volatile presidency, coincided with a period when Brady was also navigating immense personal change.Also Read: Gisele Bündchen explodes over Tom Brady’s fatherhood claims as their co-parenting pact crumbles In hindsight, the combination of Brady’s shifting public persona and Trump’s personal commentary suggests a distancing—both politically and personally—between the two once-friendly figures.

'Can't relinquish right to resist': Hamas dismisses US special envoy Witkoff's 'disarm' claim; calls his Gaza visit a 'staged show',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/cant-relinquish-right-to-resist-hamas-dismisses-witkoffs-disarm-claim-mocks-us-special-envoys-gaza-visit-as-staged-show/articleshow/123071393.cms,"Representational Image





Hamas on Saturday firmly rejected claims it has agreed to disarm as part of the ongoing ceasefire negotiations with Israel, asserting its ""national and legal"" right to resist what it calls the ""Israeli occupation. "" The denial, reported by Al Jazeera, was issued in response to remarks allegedly made by US President Donald Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff.According to Israeli daily Haaretz, a recording of Witkoff’s meeting with families of Israeli hostages held in Gaza revealed he told them Hamas was “prepared to be demilitarised.” The Palestinian militant group swiftly dismissed the claim.“The resistance and its weapons are a national and legal right as long as the [Israeli] occupation persists,” it said in a statement. “This right cannot be relinquished until our full national rights are restored—foremost among them, the establishment of a fully sovereign, independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.”Witkoff’s alleged comments came during a visit to Israel's Tel Aviv, where he met with the hostage families, following a trip to an aid distribution site in Gaza run by the American- and Israeli-backed Global Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).Hamas, which has governed the Gaza Strip since 2007, condemned his visit as to the enclave as a “staged show” aimed at deflecting attention from the deepening humanitarian crisis.Citing a United Nations report, the group accused GHF of failing to ensure civilian safety, alleging that over 1,300 Palestinians have been killed while attempting to access food from GHF-operated sites since May. Despite mounting international criticism, the United States last month announced an additional $30 million in funding for the organisation.Witkoff’s reported remarks also come as international momentum grows toward recognising Palestinian statehood. The UK has announced it could follow France in formally recognising a Palestinian state in September, should Israel not agree to a ceasefire.At a recent UN conference in New York, Brtitsh foreign secretary David Lammy reaffirmed Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s position, noting that recognition would be conditional. The conference concluded with 17 nations, the European Union, and the Arab League backing a two-state solution. Their joint statement called on Hamas to cede control of Gaza and hand over its weapons to the Palestinian Authority, under international oversight.","Hamas rejects claims it has agreed to disarm as part of the ongoing ceasefire negotiations with Israel.

The US Senate on Saturday confirmed Jeanine Pirro, a well-known Fox News personality and President Donald Trump loyalist, to a high-profile federal prosecutor role in Washington, DC.With a vote count of 50-45, Pirro secured confirmation as the US Attorney for the District of Columbia. Trump encouraged the Republican-controlled Senate to process his nominations during weekend sessions, following his return to the White House six months prior.Trump provisionally appointed Pirro to the role in May, continuing his pattern of selecting hosts from the conservative television network and steadfast supporters for influential governmental positions.Trump previously praised the outspoken 74-year-old former Westchester County district attorney when he nominated her, as being ""in a class by herself.""Jeanine Pirro is a former judge, prosecutor, and prominent conservative television personality, best known for her outspoken commentary on Fox News.Before rising to national media fame, Pirro built a lengthy legal career in New York. She served as the district attorney of Westchester County from 1994 to 2005, becoming the first woman to hold that position.During her tenure, she established the nation’s first domestic violence prosecution unit, according to the US Justice Department.Earlier in her career, she also served as a county judge.Pirro transitioned to television in the 2000s, hosting shows like Judge Jeanine Pirro (2008–2011) and Justice with Judge Jeanine on Fox News, which ran for over a decade.She later became a co-host on Fox’s popular roundtable show The Five. Her on-air segments often included inflammatory rhetoric and conspiracy theories—particularly surrounding the 2020 election—which at times led to temporary removals from the network lineup.She joins a growing list of cable news figures with political roles, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, both of whom had careers at Fox.Pirro is also a published author. Her 2018 book, Liars, Leakers, and Liberals: The Case Against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy, was described by The Washington Post as overly loyal to Donald Trump.Her personal life has not been without controversy. Her ex-husband, Albert Pirro, was convicted of tax evasion during her time as district attorney and later received a pardon from Trump during his presidency.Earlier, the Senate Judiciary Committee's leading Democrat, Dick Durbin, opposed Pirro's permanent appointment as US Attorney, describing her selection as a ""rubber stamp for Donald Trump.""Durbin referenced her role in spreading conspiracy theories about the 2020 election, which Trump lost to Biden, AP reported.Pirro was sued by Dominion Voting Systems after she promoted false claims of election fraud on Fox News. The company accused Fox of airing defamatory statements about its role in the vote count. Fox later settled the lawsuit for around $800 million.","The US Senate confirmed Jeanine Pirro, 74, to a high-profile federal prosecutor role in Washington, DC.

Cornell close to $100m White House settlement,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/cornell-close-to-100m-white-house-settlement/articleshow/123067881.cms,"White House





The White House is eyeing a settlement of as much as $100 million in negotiations with Cornell University about an agreement that would reinstate hundreds of millions of dollars in frozen federal research funding, according to people familiar with the matter. A deal could be announced as soon as next week, said the people, who asked not to be named because the talks are private. One of the issues still under discussion is whether the pact would call for a resolution monitor to supervise how Cornell is carrying out changes required by the US - an arrangement accepted by Columbia University in a landmark $221 million deal last month. Brown University announced a $50 million deal with the government this week. Cornell declined to comment.","The White House is eyeing a settlement of as much as $100 million in negotiations with Cornell University.

'All hot girls vote GOP': Is Sydney Sweeney a registered Republican? Here's the latest controversy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/all-hot-girls-vote-gop-is-sydney-sweeney-a-registered-republican-heres-the-latest-controversy/articleshow/123067671.cms,"Sydney Sweeney is a registered Republican voter from Florida which is the flashpoint of a new controversy.





As the Sydney Sweeney jeans row has become a political one, with the liberals slamming the actor for her 'good jeans' and the Republicans slamming the liberals for targeting Sweeney, the new flashpoint is the fact that Sydney Sweeney is a registered Republican in Florida. Republicans did not marvel at the Democrat discovery and said 'all hot girls vote for GOP'. Republicans also said that this is the real reason behind the liberals' anger for Sweeney -- not the American Eagle ad in which Sydney is playing with 'Jeans' and 'genes'.According to voter registration records, a Sydney B Sweeney is registered with the Republican Party of Florida in June 2024 and remains listed as an active Republican voter. Democrats claimed that this is indeed actor Sydney Swwney as she also purchased a propert in 2024 in Florida.American Eagle issued a statement addressing the controversy and clarified that it will not apologize. In a statement posted on American Eagle's Instagram account on Friday, the retailer said the ad campaign “is and always was about the jeans. Her jeans. Her story. We'll continue to celebrate how everyone wears their AE jeans with confidence, their way.Great jeans look good on everyone.”In the run-up to the ad blitz, the company's chief marketing officer told trade media outlets that it included “clever, even provocative language” and was “definitely going to push buttons.""Critics did not like it as Sweeney said: “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair colour, personality and even eye colour. My jeans are blue.” They said if the company only meant jeans and not genes, they could have hired a different model -- probably a black model.Vice President JD Vance said Democrats are calling everyone who thinks Sydney Sweeney beautiful a Nazi.The Nazi party used the pseudoscience of eugenics, which promotes some genetic features as better than others, to justify the killing of Jews and countless other minority groups during the Holocaust.""I actually thought that one of the lessons (Democrats) might take is 'we're going to be less crazy.' And the lesson they have apparently taken is 'we're going to attack people as Nazis for thinking Sydney Sweeney is beautiful,'"" Vance said. ""Great strategy, guys. That's how you're going to win the midterm, especially young American men.""",Sydney Sweeney is a registered Republican voter from Florida which is the flashpoint of a new controversy.

Nuclear drama deepens: Russia shrugs off Trump's submarine threat; boasts undersea superiority,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nuclear-drama-deepens-russia-shrugs-off-trumps-submarine-threat-boasts-undersea-superiority/articleshow/123066012.cms,"Nuclear drama deepens: Russia shrugs off Trump's submarine threat; boasts undersea superiority





In a chilling echo of Cold War posturing, Russia, in response to US President Donald Trump's nuclear vessels positioning order, claimed that it has more than enough nuclear submarines patrolling the world's oceans.Russian Duma member Viktor Vodolatsky told state-run agency TASS that Trump's order to redeploy two US nuclear submarines to ""appropriate regions"" was already anticipated, and that the American vessels are firmly within Russia's watch.""The number of Russian nuclear submarines in the world's oceans is significantly higher than the American ones, and the subs that US President Donald Trump ordered to be redirected to the appropriate regions have long been under their control. So no response from the Russian Federation to the American leader's statement about the submarines is required,"" Vodolatsky said.His comments came hours after Trump, in a Truth Social post, claimed he had repositioned US submarines in response to ""extremely provocative statements"" by Dmitry Medvedev, Russia's former president and now deputy head of the Russian Security Council.""Let the two US subs sail, they have been in the crosshairs for a long time now,"" Vodolatsky added ominously.""A fundamental agreement that must be concluded between Russia and America so that the whole world calms down and stops talking about the beginning of World War III,"" he added.While the rhetoric has sent pulses racing across global headlines, Russian foreign policy experts are calling for calm. Fyodor Lukyanov, editor-in-chief of Russia in Global Affairs, downplayed Trump's statement, suggesting it was more social media showmanship than actual military strategy.""Trump, as we know, runs his own channel and reacts, so to speak, emotionally, humanly and spontaneously. I think that the armed forces, the naval forces of the United States read this with great surprise. If this exchange of opinions continues, and Trump continues to be drawn into it, then, one way or another, he will probably have to take some action. In my opinion, so far this is only at the level of words,"" Lukyanov told local private news channel RBC TV.","Russian Duma member Viktor Vodolatsky told state-run agency TASS that Trump's order to redeploy two US nuclear submarines to ""appropriate regions"" was already anticipated.
