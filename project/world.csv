On Tuesday, he had claimed Pakistan had ""credible intelligence"" of an Indian strike within 24 to 36 hours and criticised what he called India’s “hubristic role of judge, jury and executioner.”Just a couple of days before Tarar’s account was withheld, Pakistan defence minister Khwaja Asif's account faced a similar block in India. Asif had earlier after admitted in an interview that Pakistan had historically supported and trained terrorist groups, calling it a “mistake” done on behalf of the US and Western allies.India has also banned 16 Pakistani YouTube channels accused of spreading provocative and misleading content in the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack. Collectively, these channels had over 63 million subscribers.The border situation between the two-nuclear armed neighbours has worsened significantly since the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, which left 26 people dead, most of them tourists.Since then, Pakistani troops have engaged in nightly exchanges of small arms fire across multiple sectors along the Line of Control (LoC), including Kupwara, Uri, Akhnoor, and Naushera, with Indian Army responding proportionately. Officials say the firing was unprovoked, violating the 2003 ceasefire agreement reaffirmed in 2021.India responded to the Pahalgam attack by suspending the Indus Waters Treaty and closing its airspace to Pakistani aircraft. A Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) was issued to restrict Pakistani-operated or -registered aircraft from entering Indian airspace until at least May 23.

Channi issues clarification

NEW DELHI: Congress MP and former Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi sparked outrage by questioning the credibility of India’s surgical strikes in Pakistan, saying he had “never seen where the strike took place.” The Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) came down heavily on Channi, accusing him of disrespecting the armed forces and playing politics over national security .Speaking at a press conference following the Pahalgam terror attack, in which 26 people were killed, Channi said, “Till date, I could not find where the (surgical) strike took place, where men were killed at that time, and where this happened in Pakistan. Will we not find out if a bomb is dropped in our country? They say that they did a surgical strike in Pakistan. Nothing had happened. Nowhere was a surgical strike seen. Nobody came to know… I have always demanded (proof).”Channi also took a veiled dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying, “People are waiting for the 56-inch chest to act”. He went on to say, “We have never seen where in Pakistan the strikes were done and where people were killed.”His remarks drew a sharp rebuke from BJP leaders, who accused the Congress of undermining national security. BJP spokesperson CR Kesavan said Channi had a pattern of insulting India’s forces. “In 2024, he disgustingly commented 'stuntbaazi' when Corporal Vicky Pahade was martyred. Now, he insults the armed forces again, saying they (the Army) said that we did a surgical strike on Pakistan, but nobody saw it,” Kesavan said.Delhi BJP leader Manjinder Singh Sirsa said Channi’s comments reflect the ""dirty mentality of the Gandhi family."" He asked, “What kind of mentality is this of the Congress party, the Gandhi family, Rahul Gandhi, that they keep questioning the army, the Indian Air Force?” Sirsa added, “Pakistan itself is saying that India has caused a lot of damage by conducting surgical strikes.”""Charanjit Singh Channi has again shown the dirty politics and dirty mentality of the Gandhi family, who always question the army and demoralise the forces. I condemn this,"" he further said.BJP national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla also attacked the Congress, branding it the “Pakistan Prast Party” for repeatedly seeking evidence of India’s military actions.""Congress has become Pakistan parast party (PPP). Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah says no action should be taken against Pakistan... Robert Vadra and other Congress party leaders have given a clean chit to Pakistan and blamed Hindutva... When the whole country is standing behind the army so that they can give a befitting reply to the terrorists, the Congress party is hurting the morale of the army,"" Poonawalla said.After the backlash, Channi attempted to clarify his stance, claiming he was not demanding proof of the strikes but calling for justice for the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack.""I have said earlier also that the Congress party, in this hour of grief, is standing by the government. If the government disrupts their (Pakistan's) water supply, air or whatever action it takes, we are standing like a rock with it,"" he said.“There is nothing about surgical (strike) today. Its proof is not asked for, and I am not asking for it either… Don't try to divert this. The innocent tourists who were killed after being asked about their religion—those families want justice today,” he added.Earlier on Friday, the Congress Working Committee (CWC) while expressing full support to the victims' families, passed a resolution urging the Centre to act decisively against Pakistan.

US govt wants Indian national Badar Khan Suri’s deportation suit shifted; judge pushes back,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-govt-wants-indian-national-badar-khan-suris-deportation-suit-shifted-judge-pushes-back/articleshow/120839211.cms,"The US government on Thursday asked a federal judge to transfer Indian national Badar Khan Suri’s deportation case from Virginia to Texas, where he is currently being held on charges of ""spreading Hamas propaganda.""At the hearing, US District Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles expressed doubt about the government's petition, which would require her to dismiss the Virginia case, the Associated Press reported.She emphasised that dismissal would invalidate her March directive to keep Badar Khan Suri within the US during his First Amendment proceedings.Justice Department attorney David Byerley indicated he would consult with US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement regarding the judge's concerns. He expressed confidence that ICE would respect her deportation stay order whilst the case transfers to Texas federal court.""OK,"" the judge responded. ""I'm not going to rely on that. But thank you,"" she added.In a court filing ahead of the hearing, US attorneys argued that Badar Khan Suri’s lawsuit should have been filed in Texas, not Virginia, since he was already moved out of the state. They called the transfer a ""straightforward"" legal matter.The Trump administration said it relocated Khan Suri from a detention center in Farmville, Virginia, to Louisiana and then Texas due to overcrowding.However, the judge Giles appeared doubtful about that explanation. She asked the government to provide specific data on how many beds were available in Farmville at the time of Suri’s arrest and how many detainees have actually been transferred for overcrowding.Khan Suri's attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union told the judge that he initially slept on the floor in an overcrowded Texas facility for several weeks, though he now occupies an individual cell.His legal representatives suggested the transfer to Texas aimed to secure a more conservative judicial hearing. Attorney Vishal Agraharkar accused the government of engaging in ""forum shopping.""The federal courts in Texas and western Louisiana feature predominantly Republican-appointed judges, unlike Alexandria, Virginia's US District Court.Appeals proceed to the conservative-leaning 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals. The 5th Circuit, one of 13 federal appellate courts nationwide, comprises 17 full-time judges. Twelve received appointments from Republican presidents, including six during Donald Trump's presidency.Outside the Alexandria courthouse on Thursday, Hassan Ahmad, another lawyer representing Khan Suri, reinforced Agraharkar's courtroom statements. ""There is a reason why the detention facilities exist there,"" Ahmad said, further noting that, ""This kind of rigged game has to stop,"" he said.His legal team said that his arrest and imprisonment were unconstitutional, stemming from his wife's Gaza connections. They assert that Khan Suri and his spouse, Mapheze Saleh, faced targeting because Saleh's father worked with Gaza's Hamas-supported administration before the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel.Badar Khan Suri, an Indian citizen, came to the US in 2022 on a J-1 visa and works at Georgetown University as a visiting scholar and postdoctoral fellow.He and his wife Saleh have three children—a 9-year-old son and 5-year-old twins.

The ugly Sarma vs Gogoi fight on social media

NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Friday escalated his attack on Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi , claiming that the Congress leader's children are not Indian citizens. He also raised questions about Gogoi’s alleged visit to Pakistan.""I have evidence that Gaurav Gogoi's son and daughter are not Indian citizens. We are examining what he did there (Pakistan) for 15 days. There is no tourism place in Pakistan; it is only a terrorist adda,” Sarma told ANI.The BJP leader further alleged, ""It is 100 per cent confirmed that he went there, but what did he do there in 15 days? Robert Vadra and Gaurav Gogoi are more concerned about Pakistan than India.”Sarma’s comments come a day after he made a cryptic post on X writing: ""I say this with full responsibility — the minor children of one Member of Parliament from Assam are no longer citizens of India. But this is just the beginning. There is much more yet to be revealed.""Gogoi has not yet responded to the allegations made by Sarma.Five days ago, Sarma had posted a series of pointed questions on X regarding the MP’s alleged visit to Pakistan and his family's ties to a Pakistan-based NGO.Without naming Gogoi directly, Sarma had asked whether the Congress leader had visited Pakistan for 15 consecutive days and demanded clarification on the purpose of the trip.“Questions for the Hon’ble Member of Parliament from the Congress Party: 1. Did you visit Pakistan for a continuous period of 15 days? If so, could you kindly clarify the purpose of your visit?” Sarma had said in his post.""If so, may we ask why a Pakistan-based organisation is paying a salary for activities conducted in India?” Sarma had questioned.Responding to the CM, Gogoi had hit back, asking if Sarma would resign in case he fails to prove his allegations. ""Questions for the Hon’ble Chief Minister of Assam: 1) Will you resign if you fail to prove your allegations of me and my wife being agents of an enemy country? 2) Will you take questions on your own children and wife? 3) Will the state police arrest those linked to coal mafia who make are ravaging the hills of Assam and making crores of undeclared money? Waiting for the SIT report to be submitted,"" Gogoi wrote on X.The exchange of words didn't stop at Gogoi's questions as Sarma responded to the Congress leader, saying ""sufficient material will be placed in the public domain exposing the connections between the concerned Congress Member of Parliament and Pakistan"".""I would like to clarify that neither I nor my son and daughter have ever visited Pakistan. Furthermore, my wife and our entire family would never even think of accepting any salary or financial support from Pakistan.

Police issues prohibitory order under Section 163

Police response and current situation

NEW DELHI: Amid rising tensions following the murder of Hindutva activist Suhas Shetty, the Mangaluru Police have imposed a prohibitory order across the city from Friday until May 6. Shetty, a known rowdy sheeter and Hindutva activist, was killed by a group of unidentified assailants late Thursday evening within the Bajpe police station limits in Mangaluru City.On Thursday evening, around 8:30 pm, Suhas Shetty was traveling with five associates—Sanjay, Prajwal, Anvith, Latheesh, and Shashank—when their vehicle was intercepted near Kinnipadavu Cross by a group of assailants.The attackers, numbering around six, were traveling in a Swift car and a pickup truck. They ambushed Shetty and his group, assaulting him with deadly weapons, inflicting severe injuries.Despite being rushed to AJ Hospital, Shetty succumbed to his wounds. The police have since registered a murder case and are actively working to identify and apprehend the perpetrators.Shetty was a well-known rowdy sheeter with five criminal cases—four in Mangaluru City and one in Dakshina Kannada district.Given Shetty's affiliations, his murder is considered a sensitive issue, prompting the police to launch a manhunt to locate the perpetrators.Notably, he was one of the accused in the 2022 murder of Mohammed Fazil, a 23-year-old resident of Mangalapete in Katipalla. Fazil's killing had already stirred significant tensions across the coastal region.In response to the incident, police issued the prohibitory order under Section 163 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, enforced across the entire Mangaluru City Police jurisdiction.City police commissioner Anupam Agrawal, who also serves as the additional district magistrate, announced that public gatherings, meetings, processions, sloganeering, and the carrying of items that could be used as weapons are prohibited during this period. The measure aims to prevent any potential flare-ups and maintain public order in the aftermath of the murder.Preliminary investigations suggest that the attack on Shetty was premeditated, though the exact motive remains unclear. The police have confirmed that investigations are ongoing.Following the murder, Bajrang Dal had called for a city bandh late on Thursday night, and some miscreants attempted to pelt stones at buses.

Donald Trump Sparks Controversy With Remarks on Muslim Imams and '38 Virgins,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/do-you-want-to-die-donald-trumps-bizarre-remarks-on-muslim-imams-and-38-virgins/articleshow/120827436.cms,"At a White House event marking the National Day of Prayer , President Donald Trump stood flanked by religious leaders of every stripe—Christian pastors, Jewish rabbis, Hindu swamis, Buddhist monks, and Muslim imams.But in typical Trump fashion, what began as a carefully choreographed moment of spiritual unity soon veered into campaign trail chaos, as he launched into an unscripted anecdote involving imams, death, and what he mistakenly called “38 virgins.”“I love them. They were great,” Trump said, recalling a meeting with Muslim leaders in Michigan during the 2024 campaign. “They said, ‘We don’t want to die.’ I said, ‘You want to die?’ They said, ‘We don’t want to die.’ I said, ‘What about the 38 virgins?’ They said, ‘That’s nonsense.’”The line triggered predictable mockery online. “It’s 72 virgins , not 38,” one X user deadpanned. “Trump’s math works in mysterious ways.” Another joked that the number downgrade was the latest example of the president’s famed deal-making abilities—“negotiating paradise down by 47%.”The “72 virgins” concept itself is a widely misunderstood and often misrepresented trope. It originates from a disputed hadith in some medieval Islamic texts and is not mentioned in the Quran; most mainstream Islamic scholars regard it as symbolic, apocryphal, or even satire, not doctrinal theology. Nonetheless, the idea has been weaponised by extremists and misused in the West as a crude stereotype to paint Muslim beliefs as inherently violent or absurd.But behind the laugh lines lies a far more consequential reality: Trump’s growing appeal among Muslim voters , especially in Michigan’s Arab-American communities. It’s a political realignment that few pundits predicted—and one that helped tip a critical battleground state in his favour.Earlier, during the 2024 election , many Arab and Muslim American voters, particularly in battleground Michigan, made a surprising shift toward Donald Trump. In Dearborn, a city with one of the largest Muslim populations in the United States, Trump won 42% of the vote, a remarkable jump from the roughly 26% he garnered in 2020.Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, burdened by the Biden administration’s handling of the Gaza conflict and broader Middle East policy, secured just 36%, while Green Party candidate Jill Stein received 18%. Trump’s deliberate outreach to Muslim leaders, his vows to “end the wars,” and his emphasis on religious liberty struck a chord with voters frustrated by Democratic foreign policy and progressive cultural agendas.For many Muslim Americans, particularly in Yemeni and Palestinian communities, Trump’s platform, while flawed, felt more aligned with their priorities than the Democratic status quo. It was a calculated, interest-based vote rather than an endorsement of his persona, but in a tight state like Michigan, it made all the difference.","President Donald Trump mistakenly called Muslim imams ""38 virgins"" The line triggered predictable mockery online.

US government's new policy terminates international students' legal status,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-governments-new-policy-terminates-international-students-legal-status/articleshow/120747708.cms,"File Photo (Photo: AP)

Poll Do you support the recent crackdown on international students in the US? No, it unfairly targets innocent students. Yes, it's necessary for security.

Washington, Apr 30 (AP) The US government has begun shedding new light on a crackdown on international students, spelling out how it targeted thousands of people and laying out the grounds for terminating their legal status. The new details emerged in lawsuits filed by some of the students who suddenly had their status cancelled in recent weeks with little explanation.In the past month, foreign students around the US have been rattled to learn their records had been removed from a student database maintained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement . Some went into hiding for fear of being picked up by immigration authorities or abandoned their studies to return home.On Friday, after mounting court challenges, federal officials said the government was restoring international students' legal status while it developed a framework to guide future terminations. In a court filing Monday, it shared the new policy: a document issued over the weekend with guidance on a range of reasons students' status can be cancelled, including the revocation of the visas they used to enter the US.Brad Banias, an immigration attorney representing a student whose status was terminated, said the new guidelines vastly expand ICE's authority beyond previous policy, which did not count visa revocation as grounds for losing legal status.""This just gave them carte blanche to have the State Department revoke a visa and then deport those students even if they've done nothing wrong,"" Banias said.Many of the students who had visas revoked or lost their legal status said they had only minor infractions on their record, including driving infractions. Some did not know why they were targeted at all.Lawyers for the government provided some explanation at a hearing Tuesday in the case of Banias' client Akshar Patel, an international student studying information systems in Texas. Patel's status was terminated - and then reinstated - this month, and he is seeking a preliminary court ruling to keep him from being deported.In court filings and in the hearing, Department of Homeland Security officials said they ran the names of student visa holders through the National Crime Information Center, an FBI-run database that contains reams of information related to crimes. It includes the names of suspects, missing persons and people who have been arrested, even if they have never been charged with a crime or had charges dropped.In total, about 6,400 students were identified in the database search, US District Judge Ana Reyes said in the hearing Tuesday. One of the students was Patel, who had been pulled over and charged with reckless driving in 2018. The charge was ultimately dropped - information that is also in NCIC.Patel appears in a spreadsheet with 734 students whose names had come up in NCIC. That spreadsheet was forwarded to a Homeland Security official, who, within 24 hours of receiving it, replied: ""Please terminate all in SEVIS."" That's a different database listing foreigners who have legal status as students in the US.Reyes said the short time frame suggested that no one had reviewed the records individually to find out why the students' names came up in NCIC.""All of this could have been avoided if someone had taken a beat,"" said Reyes, who was appointed by President Joe Biden. She said the government had demonstrated ""an utter lack of concern for individuals who have come into this country.""When colleges discovered the students no longer had legal status, it prompted chaos and confusion. In the past, college officials say, legal statuses typically were updated after colleges told the government the students were no longer studying at the school. In some cases, colleges told students to stop working or taking classes and warned them they could be deported.Still, government attorneys said the change in the database did not mean the students actually lost legal status, even though some of the students were labeled ""failure to maintain status."" Instead, lawyers said, it was intended to be an ""investigative red flag.""""Mr. Patel is lawfully present in the US,"" Andre Watson of the Department of Homeland Security said. ""He is not subject to immediate detention or removal.""Reyes declined to issue a preliminary injunction and urged lawyers from both sides to come to a settlement to ensure Patel could stay in the US.","Federal officials say they ran the names of student visa holders through the National Crime Information Center.

How Signal app may led to NSA Mike Waltz’s dismissal

Signal app, which became the centre of a national security controversy involving a high-ranking official in the Trump administration, appears to have directly led to significant consequences for US National Security Adviser Mike Waltz. Citing people familier with the matter, CNN reports that President Trump is expected to remove Waltz from his position in the coming days. The trouble began when it was discovered that Waltz was a participant in a group conversation on the app which was used to discuss highly sensitive military operations, specifically planned strikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen. A major breach of security occurred when a journalist was accidentally included in this conversation.The report said that Waltz's position became indefensible after he ‘mistakenly’ included the editor of The Atlantic in a Signal group chat discussing highly sensitive military strikes. This incident led to Trump considering his dismissal, though he initially didn’t do it “because he [Trump] didn’t want to provide his enemies a perceived victory”.However, Waltz's standing within the West Wing never fully recovered, and his influence waned, particularly with Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, the report added. This would be the first major staff shakeup of Trump's second term.The Signal incident proved to be a critical factor in Trump's decision.“President Trump lost confidence in him a while ago,” an administration official told the publication. Trump reportedly couldn't move past how Waltz added a journalist to the chat.The incident also reportedly highlighted a double standard, as Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who also shared sensitive information on Signal, is not facing dismissal. Trump believed Hegseth should be retained after a difficult confirmation process, and he enjoys greater support from the MAGA base.Meanwhile, Democrats on Capitol Hill criticised Trump's decision, arguing that Hegseth’s actions were more serious.",US National Security Adviser Mike Waltz is expected to be dismissed.

Turkey: Legal control as a weapon against journalists,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/turkey-legal-control-as-a-weapon-against-journalists/articleshow/120841724.cms,"Representative Image

A protective measure or an unfair punishment?

Increasing numbers of journalists face restrictions

A bid to silence potential critics?

For years, Turkey has been making international headlines for it's lackluster track record on press freedom and freedom of speech: Turkey is ranked 159th out of 180 in the latest Reporters Without Borders Press Freedom Index. According to the Turkish Journalists' Union, 18 journalists were in prison at the end of March.However, the restrictions on press freedom are by no means limited to imprisonment: Judicial restrictions are also part of a repressive system designed to systematically silence critical voices. Measures including house arrest, bans on leaving the country, and obligations to report regularly to the authorities are increasingly being used as a means of exerting pressure.Originally intended as an alternative to pre-trial detention, they are becoming an instrument of de facto punishment — especially for journalists.Hundreds of journalists are not in prison, but at home, no longer allowed to practice their profession. Recently, many well-known media professionals in Turkey have been subjected to such treatment.According to the law, judicial inspections are intended to prevent suspects from escaping or tampering with evidence. They are used in cases where there is a strong suspicion of a crime and officials see a risk of people trying to flee the law or conceal their identities. However, such measures are also increasingly being used in the wake of accusations of libel for example or posting critical social media posts, in other words, for offences that do not fall into the ""catalog of crimes"" defined in law.Veysel Ok , a lawyer who has represented many journalists in Turkey — including German daily Die Welt correspondent Deniz Yücel — no longer sees judicial control as a straightforward means of safeguarding proceedings, but as a ""penalty-like sanction.""""By law, these measures may only be imposed if the conditions for imprisonment are met. But this is often ignored in practice,"" explained Ok. Court orders have now become the norm, he said, especially in cases relating to freedom of expression.""Some are confined to their homes for years and can no longer work as journalists. Even if they are acquitted in the end, they have spent their most productive years under these restrictions,"" said the lawyer. Even social media posts or political criticism can trigger such measures.""In the past, this was not so common,"" said Ok. ""Today, control measures are imposed automatically — in political cases, against protesters or even against journalists. Almost everyone under investigation is now subject to some form of restriction.""This includes measures such as house arrest or bans on leaving the country, which prevent media professionals from doing their job. These, Ok said, also violate d the decisions of the Constitutional Court . He highlighted the case of activist Nurcan Kaya , in which the court ruled that such measures were only permissible if there were valid grounds for detention. Despite this, the practice continues, he said.These measures have two objectives, explained Ok: ""On the one hand, those involved are punished before a verdict has even been reached. The second goal is to create a climate of fear in a society that suppresses freedom of expression.""The overcrowded prisons in Turkey also encouraged the spread of judicial control, he explained. ""There are currently over 400,000 people in prison. But hundreds of thousands are living in detention-like conditions — in their city or their home. They are not arrested, but controlled — it is a method that has long since become a punishment.""Erol Onderoglu, the head of Reporters Without Borders (RSF) in Turkey, is also concerned, viewing the widespread practice of judicial control as a direct attack on the right to free reporting, as well as a curtailing of the population's ability to inform itself freely.According to Onderoglu, judicial inspections should only be applied in exceptional cases, for example when particularly serious accusations have been made. But in Turkey, a simple libel charge or a social media post is now enough to trigger restrictions on journalists.For Onderoglu, the impact of this is clear: ""This unlawful practice serves to deliberately harass and intimidate critical journalists. It is an expression of a preemptive will to punish.""","Turkey is ranked 159th out of 180 in the latest Reporters Without Borders Press Freedom Index.

TAIPEI: Taiwan detected seven sorties of People's Liberation Army (PLA) aircraft, seven People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) vessels and one ship operating near Taiwan until 6 am (local time) on Saturday.According to Taiwan's Ministry of ntional defence (MND), all seven sorties crossed the median line of the Taiwan Strait and entered Taiwan's northern and southwestern Air Defence Identification Zone (ADIZ).In response to Chinese activity, Taiwan's armed forces deployed aircraft, naval ships, and coastal missile systems to monitor the situation.Sharing a post on X, MND wrote, ""7 sorties of PLA aircraft, 7 PLAN vessels and 1 official ship operating around Taiwan were detected up until 6 a.m. (UTC+8) today. 7 out of 7 sorties crossed the median line and entered Taiwan's northern and southwestern ADIZ. We have monitored the situation and responded.""On Friday, MND detected five sorties of PLA aircraft, seven PLAN vessels and one ship operating near Taiwan until 6 am (local time).One out of five sorties crossed the median line of the Taiwan Strait and entered Taiwan's southwestern ADIZ.This incident follows a recent pattern of escalated manoeuvres by China around Taiwan, sparking concerns over regional stability as Beijing continues to assert its claims over the island. Taiwan has been governed independently since 1949. However, China considers Taiwan part of its territory and insists on eventual reunification, by force if necessary.China and Taiwan have frequently accused one another of spying, and Taiwan has arrested several people it says Beijing has hired to get intelligence or sway public opinion. According to RFA, Beijing usually rejects any role in espionage operations against Taiwan, referring to the charges as ""politically motivated"" or ""groundless.Meanwhile, a survey conducted by the Carter Center and Emory University in Atlanta revealed that over half of the Chinese population opposed using force to unify with Taiwan under any circumstances, as reported by Taipei Times.The findings, released on Wednesday in a report titled ""Sovereignty, Security, and US-China Relations: Chinese Public Opinion,"" indicated that 55.1 per cent of participants either agreed or somewhat agreed that ""the Taiwan issue should not be resolved through force under any circumstances. In comparison, 24.5 per cent either 'strongly or somewhat' disagreed with this statement, according to Taipei Times.

The United States defence department announced on Thursday the establishment of a second military zone along the Mexican border for immigration law enforcement .The new zone, situated in Texas and connected to El Paso's Fort Bliss Army base, follows the pattern of the first zone created in New Mexico last month. Military personnel in these areas are authorised to detain migrants crossing illegally until U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials take charge.Gen. Gregory Guillot, US Northern Command commander, stated: ""The establishment of a second National Defense Area increases our operational reach and effectiveness in denying illegal activity along the southern border.""On Monday, individuals who entered the U.S. illegally faced charges for breaching a national defence area in New Mexico, where the Army oversees a 170-mile (274-kilometre) stretch considered an extension of U.S. Army Garrison Fort Huachuca, Arizona.Military officials were unavailable Thursday night to specify the dimensions of the new Texas zone, which was not detailed in their press release.Those crossing the border in these military zones could face prosecution for two federal offences: illegal U.S. entry and military property trespassing. This development coincides with the Trump administration's deployment of thousands of troops to the border, while arrests have decreased to levels not seen since the mid-1960s.These military zones enable the federal government to operate outside the constraints of an 1878 law restricting military involvement in civilian law enforcement.Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, during a recent New Mexico visit, explained: ""Any illegal attempting to enter that zone is entering a military base, a federally protected area. You will be interdicted by U.S. troops and Border Patrol.""",The new zone is situated in Texas and connected to El Paso's Fort Bliss Army base.

And he works well with Rubio, specifically on immigration and terror threat in the western hemisphere.""However, another source questioned Miller's suitability, stating: ""It's too much of a full-time job [and] would take away from the things that he actually likes.""Additional candidates include Michael Anton, White House policy planning director, reportedly favoured by Vice President JD Vance.

A 73-year-old landlord from Illinois has been given a 53-year prison sentence for the fatal stabbing of a six-year-old Palestinian-American child and seriously injuring the boy's mother.In February, Joseph Czuba was found guilty of murder and hate crimes for killing Wadee Alfayoumi and attacking his mother Hanan Shaheen in 2023, following the outbreak of the Israel-Gaza conflict, BBC news reported.The victims were residing as tenants in Czuba's property in Plainfield, situated approximately 64 km from Chicago. The prosecution established that he attacked them because of their Islamic faith.Despite pleading not guilty, a jury reached a guilty verdict in under 90 minutes.At Friday's court proceedings, Wadee Alfayoumi's great uncle, Mahmoud Yousef, stated that no punishment could adequately address the child's death, as reported by NBC News.He spoke about the father's memories and plans for his son, which Czuba had wrongfully taken away. The elderly convict, appearing thin and weak in his red prison attire, chose to remain silent.The court heard testimony from the victim's mother, who provided distressing details of the attack, while Czuba's former wife testified about his increasing agitation regarding the war.Hanan Shaheen's testimony revealed that Czuba had declared ""you, as a Muslim, must die"", according to Reuters.The prosecution detailed how Czuba forcibly entered the family's rented accommodation and attacked them with a knife.

In the ongoing Maryland's Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, a new audio emerged where his wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura , who is seen currently defending her husband's innocence, in 2020 had previously sought protection from her husband, citing numerous instances of domestic violence before a Maryland judge.The 2020 audio revealed that Vasquez Sura described multiple incidents of physical abuse by Abrego Garcia, resulting in numerous police reports and visible bruises. She mentioned an earlier attempt to obtain a protective order was thwarted when his family convinced her against it, citing his father's illness.Vasquez Sura detailed an incident where Abrego Garcia pushed her near their basement, prompting her to call 911 and seek help from a neighbour. She recounted how police took ""20, 30 minutes"" to arrive, and during this time, Abrego Garcia allegedly assaulted her in front of the neighbour.She described additional incidents of violence, including early morning attacks and being struck at their daughter's birthday celebration. She also reported that her sister witnessed and reported an assault.Addressing the resurfaced audio, Vasquez Sura told USA Today that both parties were struggling at the time, citing COVID-19 pressures and Abrego Garcia's trauma from ICE detention .Court documents reveal Vasquez Sura sought protective orders in 2020 and 2021, with allegations including threats to her life and severe physical abuse resulting in injuries.Despite an immigration judge's protection from deportation, ICE deported Abrego Garcia to El Salvador with 260 other suspected gang members. His legal representation maintains his innocence regarding gang associations.Initially held in CECOT prison, Abrego Garcia was later transferred to a lower-security facility. The justice department acknowledged his deportation resulted from an ""administrative error"", though the Trump administration maintains he had no legal right to remain in the US.A Maryland federal judge ordered efforts to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return, supported by both appeals court and Supreme Court decisions. However, the administration states it cannot guarantee successful negotiations for his release from foreign custody.","Kilmar Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador with 260 other suspected gang members.

PBS chief calls Donald Trump's order to cut public media funds 'unlawful',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pbs-chief-calls-donald-trumps-order-to-cut-public-media-funds-unlawful/articleshow/120831981.cms,"Paula Kerger, President and CEO at PBS (Image: AP)

Paula Kerger, president & CEO of US public broadcasting service (PBS) on Friday criticised President Donald Trump for his latest executive order which seeks to cut federal funding for PBS and National Public Radio (NPR).Paula called it “blatantly unlawful” and a threat to their ability to serve the public with educational content.Kerger said that PBS is reviewing all available options in response to the order, which she said jeopardizes the organization's five-decade mission to educate and inform Americans through public broadcasting. “We are currently exploring all options to allow PBS to continue to serve our member stations and all Americans,” she said in a statement.The executive order, signed late Thursday, directs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) and other federal agencies to halt all funding to PBS and NPR, alleging “bias” in their coverage.The White House further claimed in a social media post that the two outlets “receive millions from taxpayers to spread radical, woke propaganda disguised as ‘news.’”However, CPB — a nonprofit organization that distributes federal funds to public media — responded by stating that it is not a federal executive agency and therefore is not subject to presidential directives. Earlier in the week, Trump announced the firing of three of CPB’s five board members and was immediately sued by CPB to stop it.The vast majority of public funds for PBS and NPR is directed to local stations, particularly those that rely heavily on government support to operate. Media advocates warn that the proposed cuts could cripple these stations, which often serve rural and underserved communities.While Republican efforts to cut public broadcasting funding are not new, this latest move is viewed by many in the industry as the most serious threat in PBS and NPR’s history. Observers see it as part of a broader campaign by Trump’s administration to dismantle such institutions which he perceives as ideologically opposed.Since starting his second term in January, President Trump has made big funding cuts to areas like the arts, education, and culture. He has also tried to change well-known institutions such as the John F Kennedy Center and the National Endowment for the Humanities. In addition, he wants to give federal money to universities and law firms only if they remove diversity programs and other efforts he doesn’t support.Two weeks ago, the White House said it plans to ask Congress to cancel funding for the CPB as part of a $9.1 billion budget cut. However, the official request hasn’t been sent to Capitol Hill yet.The move against PBS and NPR comes alongside Trump’s ongoing effort to dismantle the US Agency for Global Media — which oversees Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. The agency was designed to model independent news gathering globally in societies that restrict the press. Federal courts have already intervened in several cases, finding that the administration may have overstepped its authority in holding back funds appropriated to the outlets by Congress.","President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday.

Hegseth keeps 2 aircraft carriers in Middle East for another week for battle with Yemen's Houthis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hegseth-keeps-2-aircraft-carriers-in-middle-east-for-another-week-for-battle-with-yemens-houthis/articleshow/120831167.cms,"Hegseth keeps 2 aircraft carriers in Middle East for another week for battle with Yemen's Houthis (Credits: AP)

Defense secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered the USS Harry S Truman aircraft carrier to remain in the Middle East for a second time, keeping it there another week so the US can maintain two carrier strike groups in the region to battle Yemen-based Houthi rebels, according to a US official.In late March, Hegseth extended the deployment of the Truman and the warships in its group for a month as part of a campaign to increase strikes on the Iran-backed Houthis. The official said Hegseth signed the latest order Thursday and it is expected the Truman and its strike group warships will head home to Norfolk, Virginia, after the week is up.Gen. Erik Kurilla, head of US Central Command, requested that the Truman be extended again, according to officials. The San Diego-based USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier and its strike group arrived in the region a few weeks ago and are operating in the Gulf of Aden. The Truman, along with two destroyers and a cruiser in its strike group, is in the Red Sea.The officials spoke Friday on the condition of anonymity to discuss military operations.The US has increased its attacks on the Houthis, launching daily strikes since March 15, when President Donald Trump ordered a new, expanded campaign. He promised to use ""overwhelming lethal force"" until the Houthis stop their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea, a vital trade corridor.According to Central Command, the US has been waging an ""intense and sustained campaign"" against the Houthis. In a statement over the weekend, the command said the US has struck more than 1,000 targets in Yemen since Operation Rough Rider began. It hasn't provided details on the targets or how the data is compiled.It has been rare in recent years for the US to have two aircraft carriers in the Middle East at the same time. Navy leaders have generally been opposed to the idea because it disrupts ship maintenance schedules and delays time at home for sailors strained by the unusually high combat tempo.If there are no additional extensions and the Truman and its warships leave the region next week, those sailors could be back home by next month.Last year, the Biden administration ordered the USS Dwight D Eisenhower aircraft carrier to remain in the Red Sea for an extended time as US warships waged the most intense running sea battle since World War II. Prior to that, it had been years since the US had committed that much warship power to the Middle East.The Houthis had been waging persistent missile and drone attacks against commercial and military ships in the region in what the group's leadership has described as an effort to end Israel's war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.From November 2023 until this January, the Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and killing four sailors. That has greatly reduced the flow of trade through the Red Sea corridor, which typically sees $1 trillion of goods move through it annually.The group paused attacks in a self-imposed ceasefire until the US launched a broad assault against the rebels in mid-March.In another action, Hegseth on Friday ordered the defense department to produce a new national defense strategy and gave leaders until the end of August to have a final draft. The strategy is the main blueprint that lays out the department's priorities as it moves to confront national security threats around the world.It will be Hegseth's opportunity to highlight what he wants the US military to focus on for the next several years and how the Pentagon will shift toward Trump's ""America First"" doctrine.The draft also will have to reflect the impact of Hegseth's sweeping personnel cuts and decisions to merge a number of military commands.","Defense secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the USS Harry S Truman aircraft carrier to remain in the Middle East for a second time.

Columbia University seems to have become the new target for the Trump administration , which has accused it of anti-Semitism on college campuses . And now, the former professor Ahmed Eldin 's statement has put Columbia University in danger.Responding to a journalist , Piers Morgan's question, will he call on Hamas to release the hostages, Eldin said ""no.""His response caught netizens' attention. One of the users said, ""Exactly. That’s why I call them terrorists lovers,"" while another said, ""They released hostages during the ceasefire. Israel broke the ceasefire because they want to continue the conflict and finally take over the West Bank. They don’t want peace, they want the land.""Another user said, ""The more these people speak, the clearer it becomes—they don’t support Palestinians, they support terrorists.""Meanwhile, a senior Trump-appointed justice department official has initiated a controversial investigation into Columbia University student protesters, causing significant concern among career prosecutors who considered the probe politically driven and legally questionable, according to New York Times.The investigation, targeting students protesting Israel's actions in Gaza, faced resistance from a federal magistrate judge who considered Emil Bove III's requested measures potentially unconstitutional and unwarranted, sources revealed.This previously undisclosed broad-scale investigation by the civil rights division exemplifies the internal tensions within the department. The administration's efforts to shift the division's focus from protecting minority rights to addressing alleged antisemitism on university campuses and controlling student protests has created significant discord.Recent weeks have witnessed numerous lawyers departing the division, largely due to such directives from political appointees, according to current and former officials.While the Columbia investigation appears currently inactive, it represents a significant point of contention within the Justice Department during Trump's second term, creating lasting friction among the department, courts and FBI, sources indicated.Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, responded, ""This is a false story fabricated by a group of people who allowed antisemitism and support of Hamas terrorists to fester for several years, standing by but doing nothing.""The administration's commitment to addressing campus protests against Israel's Gaza operations has targeted both university administrators and student activists, with some facing immigration detention. Activists contend that authorities are incorrectly equating policy criticism with antisemitism.The investigation commenced after February 26 events at Barnard College, where masked protesters entered Milbank Hall to oppose student expulsions. The incident, captured on video, resulted in minor injuries to a security guard.Bove directed an immediate investigation, particularly focusing on Columbia University Apartheid Divest, according to three anonymous sources familiar with the private details.Career prosecutors resisted Bove's instructions to obtain the group's membership list, questioning its existence and expressing concerns about First Amendment violations, these sources revealed.Samantha Trepel, who previously secured Derek Chauvin's federal conviction in the George Floyd case, was among the Justice Department lawyers assigned to this investigation, according to these individuals.","Former Columbia professor Ahmed Eldin said he would not call on Hamas to release the hostages.

"US wants India to work with Pak for peace, India action against perpetrators",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/us-nudges-india-pakistan-to-work-together-de-escalate-tension/articleshow/120803002.cms,"Condemn attack, revive direct talks: Rubio to Pak

NEW DELHI: The US stepped in to prevent any military conflict between India and Pakistan over the Pahalgam terrorist attack as it asked both countries to avoid any flare-up and work for peace. India has been weighing punitive measures against Pakistan for its cross-border adventurism, but secretary of state Marco Rubio “encouraged” India in a phone conversation with counterpart S Jaishankar to work with Pakistan to de-escalate tensions and maintain peace and security in South Asia.There was no readout of the talks from the Indian side but Jaishankar himself said in a laconic post on X after his talks with Rubio that the perpetrators, backers and planners of the terrorist attack must be brought to justice. Rubio had spoken to Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif before his talks with Jaishankar and urged Pakistani officials’ cooperation in investigating “this unconscionable attack”. The state department’s Hindi account on X said in a post on Thursday evening that under US President Donald Trump those who support terrorism will have to face consequences.“The Secretary expressed his sorrow for the lives lost in the horrific terrorist attack in Pahalgam and reaffirmed the United States’ commitment to cooperation with India against terrorism,’’ said the US readout.The state department readout of the Rubio conversations seemed carefully worded as it said in the case of Pakistan that while urging it to work with India for peace, Rubio asked Sharif to “re-establish direct communications” but avoided the same in the Rubio-Jaishankar readout. The secretary spoke to Sharif about the need to condemn the Pahalgam terror attack , something that Pakistan has not done except at the UN Security Council where it joined others as a non-permanent member to condemn the attack but not before working to dilute the statement with help from China.According to the state department, Rubio and Sharif reaffirmed their “continued commitment” to holding terrorists accountable for their heinous acts of violence. Rubio had last month too in a conversation with Pakistan foreign minister Ishaq Dar underscored the importance of continued cooperation on counterterrorism between the US and Pakistan, while thanking Pakistan for the arrest and transfer to the US of ISIS-K operative Mohammad Sharifullah. The 2 countries also plan to hold a counterterrorism dialogue in June this year.Rubio was said to be encouraging other foreign ministers too to work with India and Pakistan to defuse tensions and his conversation with Jaishankar followed statements by powerful Gulf States like Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which also have strong ties with both countries, asking them to exercise restraint.US President Donad Trump had strongly condemned the Pahalgam attack and expressed full support to India to bring to justice the perpetrators. However, he later also said he’s close to both India and Pakistan and that they’ll themselves “get it figured out one way or the other”.",The US stepped in to prevent any military conflict between India and Pakistan over the Pahalgam terrorist attack.

Even in a country where the military has always loomed over governance, this is the first time that the ISI head will also officiate as NSA.The appointment, effective immediately, comes less than 10 days after the April 22 terrorist attack on tourists in J&K’s Pahalgam that put Pakistan in India’s crosshairs and triggered a diplomatic firestorm.Lt Gen Malik, who took over as ISI chief in Sept 2024, will advise PM Shehbaz Sharif on national security and foreign policy while steering Pakistan’s intelligence apparatus. The dual role, announced via a cabinet division notification, is widely seen as a power grab by the military, sidelining the civilian leadership at a time of reckoning.Pakistan’s denial of involvement in the Pahalgam attack – 26 people were killed – and calls for a “neutral” probe have done little to placate India.While Malik’s elevation amplifies ISI’s influence in shaping Pakistan’s response, both militarily and politically, critics argue this move exposes the fragility of Pakistan’s civilian governance.“Appointing the ISI chief as NSA hands the military a blank check to dictate terms, not just on security but in backchannel talks with India,” said a former diplomat.Malik’s track record as adjutant general, where he oversaw the crackdown on ex-PM Imran Khan’s supporters during the 2023 riots, suggests a hardline approach. His closeness to Army chief Gen Asim Munir, who handpicked him for the ISI role, has fuelled concerns of a military-driven agenda.Posts on X reflect public unease, with some calling it a step toward a “soft coup”, while others see it as a pragmatic response to India’s stand.The consolidation of power in Malik’s hands risks alienating civilian stakeholders and complicating diplomacy, especially after PM Narendra Modi vowed “complete operational freedom” for India’s armed forces.With the NSA post vacant since April 2022, Malik’s appointment fills a strategic void but raises questions about whether Pakistan’s military is preparing for war, negotiation, or both.","Lt Gen Muhammad Asim Malik appointed as the country’s national security adviser.

KECH: Two young Baloch students have allegedly been forcibly taken by Pakistsecurity forces in Turbat, the primary city of the Kech district in Balochistan, as reported by The Balochistan Post (TBP).Seventeen-year-old Shey Haq Baloch, the son of the deceased Altaf Baloch, and sixteen-year-old Adam Baloch, son of Saleem, were purportedly apprehended by security personnel on Tuesday shortly after arriving in Turbat from Karachi, according to TBP.Nugra Baloch, Shey Haq's sister, verified the occurrence in a Facebook post. She stated that both boys were first-year college students and were detained by Pakistani forces and intelligence agencies, as highlighted by the TBP report.""I call upon everyone to speak out against this unlawful and cruel act,"" she wrote. ""Assist us in our struggle for the safe return of my brother and Adam Baloch."" Shey Haq Baloch's father, Altaf Baloch, was killed in 2008 when Pakistani forces reportedly opened fire on a peaceful rally held by the Baloch National Front (BNF) in Turbat, according to the TBP report.In another instance on April 30, two young men, Amir, son of Dad Bakhsh, and Usman, son of Abdul Ghani, were reportedly kidnapped from a barber shop in Pasni, in Gwadar district. Both are locals of the town. A further case has been reported from Turbat's D-Baloch area, where Abdul Majeed, son of Abdul Ghani, was allegedly taken by unidentified armed individuals while he was waiting for transport with his children, as highlighted by the TBP report.Enforced disappearances in Balochistan continue to pose a serious and persistent issue. Human rights organisations have long accused Pakistani security agencies of systematically targeting students, activists, and ordinary civilians, according to the TBP report.Earlier on Tuesday, United Nations human rights experts described the ""relentless use of enforced disappearances"" in Balochistan as ""a severe human rights violation and an international crime"" and urged Pakistan to establish ""independent and effective mechanisms for searching and investigating,"" as per the TBP report.","Two young Baloch students have allegedly been forcibly taken by Pakistani security forces.

Thai prosecutors dropped royal defamation charges on Thursday against an American scholar accused of insulting the monarchy over an article published on a political website.Paul Chambers a longtime Southeast Asia politics scholar in Thailand, was arrested last month in Phitsanulok province, north of Bangkok, under the kingdom's strict lese-majeste laws .The case marked a rare instance of a foreign national being charged under Thailand's lese-majeste law, which bans criticism of King Maha Vajiralongkorn and his close family and carries sentences of up to 15 years in jail per offence.The Office of the Attorney-General said on Thursday it had decided ""not to indict"" Chambers.""The director-general had decided not to indict the suspect,"" the statement said, adding that prosecutors would seek to dismiss the case in court and coordinate with police.The Thai army, a staunch defender of the monarchy, filed the complaint over a short blurb posted on a political think tank website this year.A military spokesperson last week defended the decision to file the case following criticism that the army had no legal standing to do so under the Thai law.Trade talks between Thailand and the United States have been indefinitely postponed, fuelling speculation that the arrest may have strained diplomatic ties between the two countries.International watchdogs have expressed concern over the use of the lese-majeste laws, known as Article 112 against academics, activists and even students.One man in northern Thailand was jailed for at least 50 years for lese-majeste last year, while a woman was given a 43-year prison sentence in 2021.In 2023, a man was jailed for two years for selling satirical calendars featuring rubber ducks that a court said defamed the king.","Paul Chambers a longtime Southeast Asia politics scholar in Thailand.

A Bangladesh court on Wednesday granted bail to former Iskcon leader Chinmoy Krishna Das in a sedition case , reported Bangladesh's The Daily Star.Das was arrested following a controversy that erupted when a sedition case was filed against him and 18 others in Chittagong on October 30 last year.The charges were linked to the hoisting of a saffron flag above Bangladesh's official flag during the October 25 rally at Laldighi Maidan in Chattogram.Das was presented before a Chittagong court on Tuesday, where his bail plea was denied, and he was sent into custody. The arrest has triggered widespread outrage, with many demanding his immediate release.Das serves as the spokesperson for the Bangladesh Sammilita Sanatani Jagran Jote , a group that champions the rights and security of minorities. He has been a vocal advocate for the Hindu (Sanatani) community in Bangladesh, calling for key reforms such as a minority protection law, a tribunal for fast-tracking cases of minority persecution, and the establishment of a dedicated ministry of minority affairs.He gained widespread attention for organising large public rallies, including one in Chittagong on October 25 and another in Rangpur on November 22, which sparked significant socio-political discussions across the country.Das hails from Satkania Upazila in Chittagong. From 2016 to 2022, he was the Chittagong divisional secretary of Iskcon. He gained popularity at an early age for his religious speeches and earned the nickname of ‘Shishu Bokta’, or ‘child orator’, reports Bangladeshi media.",Chinmoy Krishna Das is a former Iskcon leader.

Astrologer in Myanmar with 300k followers who predicted earthquake ‘in 12 days’ after deadly tremor arrested,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/astrologer-in-myanmar-with-300k-followers-who-predicted-earthquake-in-12-days-after-deadly-tremor-arrested/articleshow/120581055.cms,"A popular TikTok astrologer has been arrested in Myanmar after his viral prediction of another major earthquake stirred panic in a country still reeling from last month’s deadly tremor.John Moe The, 21, told his 300,000+ followers on April 9 that a “very strong” earthquake would strike “every city in Myanmar” within 12 days. “People should not stay in tall buildings,” read the warning, viewed 3.3 million times. “Take important things with you and run away from buildings during the shaking.”His prediction came just weeks after a real quake killed over 3,700 people and displaced 60,000, many of whom remain in tent encampments too afraid to return home. Authorities said the video caused renewed public fear.He was arrested Tuesday in a raid on his home in Monywa city, central Myanmar. The military government said in a statement: “We got a tip-off about fake news… Action will be taken effectively against him… and against those who spread or share fake news.”Though earthquake early warning systems exist, scientists including the USGS insist that predicting quakes in advance remains impossible. John Moe The’s account, titled ""John (Palmistry)"", also included cosmic predictions about political upheavals and foreign military strikes.Some, like Yangon resident Nan Nan, dismissed the video—but said others took it seriously. “Most of my neighbours dared not stay in their apartments,” she told AFP. “My friend even hired a small house outside Yangon in preparation.”As aftershocks continue and mistrust deepens, the arrest has sparked questions over the line between public caution and panic—and whether astrology should come with a warning label.","John Moe The, 21, told his 300,000+ followers on April 9 that a “very strong” earthquake would strike “every city in Myanmar” within 12 days.

COLOMBO: Sri Lanka's catholic church says the Vatican has named 167 of its faithful killed in Islamic State-inspired suicide bombings six years ago as witnesses of faith.Hundreds, including Christian, Buddhist, Hindu and Islamic religious figures, attended a vigil Monday in memory of the victims at the church of St. Anthony, targeted in the attacks.Archbishop of Colombo, Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, told the attendees Cardinal Marcello Semeraro, prefect of the Dicastery for the Causes of Saints in the Vatican, has included the names of 167 catholics who died in the bombings in the churches of St. Anthony in Colombo and St. Sebastian in Negombo ""in the catalogue of the witnesses of the faith in its order book, considering the context of their heroism.""He said they were chosen ""due to violent opposition to their faith motivated by 'odium fidei,' the hate of the faith."" Ranjith also said seven victims of other faiths were ""respectfully remembered.""Witnesses of faith are those who sacrificed their lives for their belief. Pope Francis formalized in 2023 a new category of recognition by the church of people who lost their lives while professing the catholic faith and created a special Vatican commission to catalogue their cases. The commission, based in the Vatican's saint-making office, has gathered hundreds of cases, with a view to highlighting them alongside officially recognized martyrs of the church, who are on the path to possible beatification or sainthood.More than 260 people, including 42 foreigners, were killed in the near-simultaneous bombings during Easter Sunday at three tourist hotels and three churches, two Catholic and one Protestant, on April 21, 2019.The catholic church in Sri Lanka has demanded further probing in the attacks, particularly after British television Channel 4 interviewed a man who said that he arranged a meeting between a local IS-inspired group, National Thowheed Jamath, and a top state intelligence official to hatch a plot to create insecurity in Sri Lanka and enable former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to win the presidential election later that year.","Sri Lanka's catholic church says the Vatican has named 167 of its faithful killed in Islamic State-inspired suicide bombings six years ago as witnesses of faith.
