SC backs sacking of Lt for shunning his troops' rituals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-backs-sacking-of-lt-for-shunning-his-troops-rituals/articleshow/125576647.cms,"'Refusal to join troops at gurdwara shows your religious ego': SC slams lieutenant

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday severely criticised a Christian lieutenant for putting his own understanding of his faith over and above the religious sentiments of soldiers he was leading, and endorsed the Army brass's decision to sack him.""I have participated in all religious celebrations like Holi, Diwali and Lori. But I cannot be forced to offer flowers or hold 'thali' inside a gurdwara as that is a religious ritual which my religion does not permit me to perform. My religion does not permit me to worship another god,"" said Lt Samuel Kamalesan, who had been commanding a troop of cavalrymen comprising Sikhs, Rajputs and Jats.The bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi said one cannot claim breach of fundamental right to religion just because one's sentiments get violated. ""You must respect the faith of majority of the troops under your command... He may be an outstanding officer, but unfit to be in the secular and highly disciplined Army,"" it said.Appearing for Lt Samuel Kamalesan, senior advocate G Sankaranarayanan challenged the validity of the sacking order on the ground that it violated his fundamental right to practise and profess a particular religion guaranteed under Article 25 of the Constitution.The bench, after perusing records, said to dispel his dogmatic views, Army authorities had taken the lieutenant to a renowned pastor in Chandigarh who advised him that going inside the sanctum sanctorum of a 'sarv dharma sthal' would not violate his religious rights.""Despite that you remained obstinate and refused to go into the gurdwara where your troops were praying. This demonstrates your mindset and your religious ego. You do not follow the advice of the pastor. You admit that your fellow Christian officers in the Army told you to be part of the religious rituals of the troops. But you stuck to your own interpretation and understanding of Christianity and refused to offer flowers at gurdwara,"" the bench said. ""You cannot bring in your own private understanding of religion to hurt the sentiments of your troops.""Sankaranarayanan said there was no 'sarv dharma sthal' where he was posted, only a gurudwara and a temple.As the bench said the lieutenant was unfit to be in the secular Army, the counsel replied, ""It is not a secular Army as it has caste-based regiments"".The bench said it will not get into a debate on the Army. ""The lieutenant is guilty of not respecting the sentiments of his troops and defying the orders of the superiors,"" it said.When the counsel said it will send a wrong signal, the bench said, ""Let us send a correct and strong signal."" It dismissed the officer's appeal without calling upon additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati to respond to the petition.","The bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi said one cannot claim breach of fundamental right to religion just because one's sentiments get violated.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Tuesday agreed to Trinamool Congress 's request for a meeting with the poll body, against the backdrop of the party attributing the recent suicides and deaths of booth level officers (BLOs) to ""workload"" arising out of the ongoing special intensive revision (SIR) in the state, reports Bharti Jain.Responding to the request from TMC MP Derek O'Brien for an appointment to a 10-member delegation of party MPs, the commission, in a letter addressed to party chairperson Mamata Banerjee and copied to Derek, invited the delegation - though a truncated one, comprising the TMC's 'authorised representative' and four other members - for a meeting at 11 am on Friday (Nov 28).Mamata had Monday written to EC expressing concerns over the proposed hiring of 1,000 data entry operators by the West Bengal chief electoral officer and the EC proposal to set up polling stations in private housing complexes.EC, in its reply Tuesday, said it welcomes regular interaction with political parties and sought names of the five members for the TMC delegation. The reduced strength of the delegation was, however, questioned by national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee, who asked why EC was scared to face 10 MPs. He even dared EC to telecast the meeting live.Derek, meanwhile, wrote to EC again Tuesday, reiterating the 10 names for the delegation.Interestingly, the 'authorised representatives' of the party - who, as per EC records, are Lok Sabha MPs Abhishek Banerjee and Kakoli Dastidar - do not figure on this list of 10.Sources in EC said as per the rule, only the party president or ""authorised party representatives"" declared to the commission can nominate members of their party's delegation for a meeting with EC. Commission sources said it may write back to Derek pointing out this norm and request that the communication naming members of the delegation be sent to it by either Trinamool chairperson Mamata or its two 'authorised representatives', as per EC records.","The Election Commission on Tuesday agreed to Trinamool Congress's request for a meeting with the poll body.

NEW DLEHI: China on Tuesday denied allegations that an Indian woman from Arunachal Pradesh was harassed or detained at Shanghai airport, insisting that its border checks were conducted strictly “in accordance with laws and regulations. ” The statement came even as India lodged a strong diplomatic protest.The woman, Pema Wangjom Thongdok, a UK-based Indian passport holder, was travelling from London to Japan on November 21 when immigration officials reportedly flagged her passport as “invalid” because it listed Arunachal Pradesh as her birthplace.She later wrote on social media that she was held for around 18 hours, until officials at the Indian Consulate in Shanghai intervened.Responding to PTI’s query on the incident, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said the woman was not subjected to any coercive action.“During the entire time, China’s border inspection authorities carried out checks procedures in accordance with laws and regulations… no compulsory measures were taken on her, and there was no so-called ‘detaining’ or ‘harassing’,” Mao said, adding that the airline had provided “resting facilities and meals.”Mao also said Beijing’s position on the state, saying, “Zangnan is China’s territory, and China does not recognise the so-called Arunachal Pradesh illegally established by India.”Citing sources agencies said, a demarche was issued to China in New Delhi and Beijing on the day of the incident, asserting that Arunachal Pradesh is an “indisputable” part of India and residents are entitled to travel on Indian passports.

‘Strong demarche was made with the Chinese side’



NEW DELHI: An Indian citizen from Arunachal Pradesh was held for over 18 hours in Shanghai airport after Chinese officials declared her Indian passport invalid.Prema Wangjom Thongdok, said she is an Indian citizen living in the UK for about 14 years. The ordeal occurred while she was traveling from London’s Gatwick to Japan via a transit in Shanghai.Describing her harrowing experience she told ANI, “I had basically crossed e-gates, standing in the queue for my next flight, and then one of the officials from the Chinese immigration came over and singled me out of the queue. I asked her what was happening, she didn’t say much, just asked me to follow her. And she went on to say, 'Arunachal- not India, China-China, your visa is not acceptable. Your passport is invalid. 'She further went on to narrate the alleged misbehavior of the officials at the airport, accusing them of “mocking” and “laughing” at her.“When I tried to question them, they said, 'Arunachal is not part of India' and started mocking and laughing, saying things like 'you should apply for the Chinese passport, you're Chinese, you're not Indian.’”She added that she had transited through Shanghai previously without issue and described the experience as humiliating, with airport and airline staff allegedly laughing and pointing at her passport.Thongdok also claimed that she had already consulted the Chinese embassy in London regarding the transit and she was assured that no visa would be required for a layover.Thongdok claimed she couldn't reach out for any help from anyone as there were wifi issues and social platforms like Google and Whatsapp don’t work in the country.She was eventually assisted by Indian embassy officials from Shanghai and Beijing, who helped resolve the issue and provided support during the prolonged wait. She said she was finally able to leave the airport around 10:30PM.Thongdok went on to add, , ""... We are part of India... We speak 'shuddh Hindi', we don't understand C of Chinese, we are all Indian... I want to raise this awareness that residents of the northeast of India should not face such harassment in terms of being called and being told that you are not a part of the country that you're so proudly a citizen of. I would like the government of India to raise this on a diplomatic level with the Chinese authorities. This is not something a regular citizen can resolve. I would just like to request the government of India to take strict action against the Chinese authorities and the government on such matters...""She further told ANI, after her return she reached out to the higher up authorities in the country, writing to them via mails, requesting such incident not be repeated.I wrote an email to the ministry of external affairs, PMO, CM of Arunachal Pradesh, foreign secretary, that such an incident shouldn't happen to someone who is just a normal citizen…”Thongdok referred to the incident as a possible hassle tactic used by Chinese officials to harass Indian citizens, especially as it was the weekend so there would be less chance of an official intervention, as government offices are closed.“Just to be harassed for so many hours, I think it might be quite a tactic used by the Chinese government to hassle citizens of India, especially from Arunachal Pradesh... I'm just grateful to the team from the Indian embassy who helped me get out of there finally.”Before the interview with ANI she had posted about her order on X, tagging government authorities including Union minister Kiran Rijiju who himself hails from Arunachal Pradesh, and PMO office, highlighting the extended detention and questioning of her citizenship based on her birthplace.Thongdok wrote, “ @pemakhandu @kirenrijuju @PMOIndia I was held at Shanghai airport for over 18 hrs on 21st Nov, 2025 on claims by China immigration & @chinaeasternair They called my Indian passport invalid as my birthplace is Arunachal Pradesh which they claimed is Chinese territory.”ANI citing sources claimed, a “strong demarche was made with the Chinese side, in Beijing and in Delhi, on the same day the incident took place.

Arunachal Pradesh is indisputably Indian territory and its residents are perfectly entitled to hold and travel with Indian passports. ⁠It has also been highlighted that the actions of the Chinese authorities are in contravention of the Chicago and Montreal Conventions relating to civil aviation.”The actions were termed “ unnecessary obstructions” to restoring normalcy in the bilateral ties between the two sides.“At a time when both sides are working on restoring normalcy, such actions by the Chinese side introduce unnecessary obstructions to the process.”",An Indian citizen from Arunachal Pradesh was held for over 18 hours in Shanghai airport after Chinese officials declared her Indian passport invalid.

NEW DELHI: Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind (JUH) president Maulana Arshad Madani's remarks alleging discrimination against Muslims while citing the example of Al-Falah University, which is under the scanner in the Delhi blast probe, have triggered a storm. Accusing the govt of working relentlessly to ensure that Muslims don't progress, Madani claimed that while Zohran Mamdani and Sadiq Khan could become the mayors of New York and London, respectively, Muslims in India cannot even become vice chancellors of universities.""And even if someone does, they will be sent to jail, like Azam Khan. Look at what is happening today with Al-Falah. He (the founder) is in jail, and how many years he will spend in jail, no one knows,"" Madani, chief of one of the two JUH factions, said, speaking at a session at Jamiat headquarters in Delhi Saturday.The founder of Al-Falah University, Jawed Siddiqui, is in custody of the Enforcement Directorate. Besides the current probe, it is alleged that Siddiqui was held in Delhi in an earlier case following a complaint of cheating and spent over two years in Tihar jail. He came out on bail in Feb 2004 and was later acquitted in the case by court the next year, after he and his brother agreed to make repayments.Madani said, ""The govt, since the time India got freedom, has been working on preventing Muslims from raising their heads.It is the result of this that today you hear people saying that there is a lack of leadership among Muslims."" Citing a Hindi idiom, he said the govt wants the Muslims ""to feel the ground slipping under their feet"", and ""it is happening...""BJP netas hit back on Sunday over Madani's remarks. Party spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla told PTI, ""In the name of vote bank, the 'bhaijann of appeasement' and the 'aatanki bachao jamaat (save terrorists group)' has become active."" He added, ""Arshad Madani ji, leave aside this talk of mayor; this country has seen Muslims becoming president, vice president, chief justice, home minister. The biggest artists and businessmen have also come from the Muslim community. "" BJP member Shahnawaz Hussain slammed Madani's statement as ""very irresponsible"".However, some Congress netas saw merit in Madani's remarks. Former MP Sandeep Dikshit said, ""This govt has launched a very systematic campaign against a particular religion.""

'Sindh may return to India': Rajnath says 'borders can change'; cites civilisational link,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sindh-may-return-to-india-rajnath-says-borders-can-change-cites-civilisational-link/articleshow/125520334.cms,"‘Sindh May Return To India Again’: Rajnath Singh’s Big Remark On India-Pakistan Border

NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday said the borders ""can change"" as he hinted that Sindh, which went to Pakistan during Partition, could ""return to India again someday,"" stressing the region's deep civilisational ties with the country.Speaking at an event, he said, “Today, the land of Sindh may not be a part of India, but civilisationally, Sindh will always be a part of India. And as far as land is concerned, borders can change. Who knows, tomorrow Sindh may return to India again.”The minister referred to the Sindh province along the Indus River, noting that many Sindhi families migrated to India after 1947. Citing former deputy PM and BJP stalwart LK Advani, he said Sindhi Hindus of that generation had never fully reconciled with the separation.“Lal Krishna Advani wrote in one of his books that Sindhi Hindus, especially those of his generation, still haven't accepted the separation of Sindh from India,” Singh said.He cited Advani to underline that the Indus River’s importance goes far beyond geography. “Not just in Sindh, but throughout India, Hindus consider the Indus River sacred. Many Muslims in Sindh also believed that the water of the Indus was no less sacred than the Aab-e-Zamzam of Mecca.This is Advani ji's quote.”Reiterating the emotional link, Singh said, “Our people of Sindh, who hold the Indus River sacred, will always be our own. No matter where they are, they will always be ours.”Also read: French navy slams Pakistan media over misinformation on Operation Sindoor; calls Rafale claims fabricated Singh also recalled his efforts to provide proper citizenship via law to various immigrant Sindhi families after his visit to the community in Delhi back in 2019, describing their living conditions as ""distressing."" He went on to add that because of NDA being in minority in Rajya Sabha back then, the bill collapsed in the upper house, but Amit Shah taking over the home affairs continued the work in the direction, a possible reference to Citizenship Amendment Act.""People from the Sindhi community and various other non-Muslim groups had fled to Delhi, where they were living in slums in extremely distressing conditions. I personally went to see them. After returning, I decided that we would enact whatever laws were necessary to grant them proper citizenship. I spoke to Prime Minister Modi and apprised him that I was moving forward in this direction. The bill was prepared, I introduced it in the Lok Sabha, and it was passed there. But it was the final phase of 2019, only a few months were left, and we did not have a majority in the Rajya Sabha. I spoke to several opposition leaders, but they refused to support it. I said that if it didn’t pass that year, it would certainly be passed the next year. Later, when Amit Shah became the Home Minister, I spoke to him, and he took the work forward,"" he added.Earlier in September while interacting with the Indian community in Morocco, Singh had expressed confidence that Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) would integrate with India “without aggressive steps”.“PoK will be ours on its own. Demands have started being made in PoK, you must have heard sloganeering,” he had said then.","Defence minister Rajnath Singh said the borders ""can change"" as he hinted that Sindh, which went to Pakistan during Partition, could ""return to India again someday"" Citing former deputy PM and BJP stalwart LK Advani, he said Sindhi Hindus had never fully reconciled with the separation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125521493,imgsize-609930,width-400,resizemode-4/defence-minister-rajnath-singh-pti.jpg"

Trump ‘Takes U-Turn’ After Zohran Mamdani ‘Openly Dares’ US President Inside Oval Office | Watch





New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani has described the “weirdest” thing he saw during his visit to the White House to meet president Donald Trump Speaking on The Adam Friedland Show on Monday, Mamdani said he noticed a stack of coffee-table books on a table, including one titled UFC at the White House. “I had no idea, and I was just flippin’, flippin’ through that,” he said. UFC White House is an upcoming mixed martial arts event that will take place in June 2026, on the South Lawn of the White House.Asked if he planned to attend the White House UFC event scheduled for June, Mamdani simply said, “No,” prompting laughter from the host and himself.Friedland also asked how Mamdani stayed composed during the White House news conference, where observers were surprised by his calm demeanour. Mamdani said he focused on his priorities for the city. “Honestly, I was just thinking about New York City,” he said.The recent meeting between Mamdani and Trump marked a sharp contrast to their contentious relationship during the mayoral campaign. Mamdani defeated former governor Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary and then beat him again in the general election, after Cuomo launched an independent bid alongside Republican Curtis Sliwa.Mamdani won the November 4 vote with a clear majority.Throughout the race, Trump repeatedly criticised Mamdani, calling him a “communist lunatic” and questioning his fitness for office, while also threatening to withhold federal funding from New York if Mamdani won.However, at the White House meeting last week, Trump appeared to reverse his stance, praising Mamdani and saying he would feel comfortable living in New York City.","New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani has described the “weirdest” thing he saw during his visit to the White House to meet president Donald Trump.

Citing concerns for national security, officials argue that the previous administration failed to conduct adequate vetting. Refugee rights activists strongly condemn this decision as 'deeply inhumane' and a painful reminder of past traumas.

'Operational necessity'

Biometric Crackdown: Green Card Holders Face New Rules as US Tightens Immigration Security

'Unspeakably cruel'

What will happen after re-interview?

USCIS will terminate the refugee status of pepple if they are found not to meet refugee criteria.

The memo said the USCIS will also review and re-interview refugees admitted outside the timeframe.

USCIS may deny green cards even for those who already have them.

There will be no appeal against the denial and the only legal option will be to contest the removal order in an immigration court.





The Donald Trump administration has made a major decision to reinterview certain refugees who were admitted to the US by the previous Joe Biden administration. Until the reinterview, the administration will not proceed with the process of granting the refugees a Green Card. Anyone admitted to the US as a refugee is eligible and required to apply for a Green Card after a year of living in the US.CNN repported that the US Citizenship and Immigration Services issued a memo that the administration is planning a comprehensive review and re-interview of all refugees admitted between January 20, 2021 and February 20, 2025 -- the period that captures the Biden administration.The administration called the decision an operational necessity to ensure that refugees do not pose a national security or public safety threat. They claimed that the previous administration did not sufficiently vet the people who entered the US. Around 235,000 refugees entered the US between 2021 and 2025 after proving to the administration that they were facing persecuttion in their home countries.Mark Hetfield, the president of HIAS, a refugee resettlement organization, told CNN that the decision is unspeakably cruel. “Just the threat of this is unspeakably cruel. … To threaten refugees with taking away their status would be re-traumatizing and a vicious misuse of taxpayer money,"" he said. “They pass intensive reviews of their refugee status, background checks, and security screenings.

Video recorded by cops

BENGALURU: In a chilling turn of events in Attibele, south Bengaluru, a young mother accused her husband of slowly poisoning her — by injecting mercury into her body — just hours before she died. Her pre-death statement, recorded from her hospital bed, has now become the focal point of the investigation.Vidya A, a resident of Tilaknagar and mother of a four-year-old boy, gave the statement to Attibele police from her hospital bed at Victoria Hospital Sunday. By Monday morning, she was dead. Police said an autopsy has been done, but the cause of death is not yet known. The forensic laboratory report is awaited, cops said.Following her final statement, police initially registered an attempt-to-murder case on Nov 23 under Section 109 of the BNS. Bengaluru Rural SP CK Baba confirmed that the case is now being upgraded to a dowry death, citing the harassment Vidya reportedly endured.“We have sent viscera samples to the forensic science laboratory to test for the presence of mercury in the deceased’s body. Based on the FSL report and the opinion of the doctor who conducted the postmortem, we will continue the investigation,” said a police official.According to Vidya’s complaint, she suspected that she had been injected with something on the night of Feb 26.In a video recording made for police, Vidya said she was surprised by her businessman husband Basavaraju’s unusual display of affection that night, but lost consciousness shortly afterward.She later stated: “I woke up on the evening of Feb 27 and found that something had been injected into my right thigh. Unable to bear the pain, I visited Attibele govt hospital on March 7, where I was advised to go to Oxford Hospital. After undergoing several tests, I was told there was mercury in my body. I spent one-and-a-half months there as an inpatient before being shifted to Victoria Hospital. Doctors told me mercury had spread throughout my body, weakening my organs and damaging my kidneys. """"I had to undergo regular dialysis. My husband and father-in-law tortured me, calling me a mad woman. With the intention to murder, they injected mercury into my right thigh.”Police said the statements from Vidya’s parents, who live in Attibele, will also be recorded.","Vidya A, a resident of Tilaknagar and mother of a four-year-old boy, gave the statement to Attibele police from her hospital bed at Victoria Hospital Sunday.

From chainsaws to silence: DOGE's brief tenure



DOGE staff scattered across government as agency dissolves







The Department of Government Efficiency, the cost-cutting initiative led by billionaire Elon Musk that dominated the early months of President Donald Trump's second term, has been shut down with eight months remaining on its charter, according to Reuters, in what appears to be the administration's ultimate cost-saving measure.""That doesn't exist,"" Office of Personnel Management Director Scott Kupor told Reuters when asked about DOGE's status, confirming it is no longer a ""centralised entity."" The OPM has since absorbed many of DOGE's functions, marking the end of an agency that promised sweeping government reform but delivered questionable results.Created in January through executive order, DOGE was expected to operate through July 2026. The agency made dramatic efforts to shrink federal agencies, cut budgets, and redirect work to Trump priorities in its early months. Elon Musk, who initially led the department, regularly promoted its work on social media and famously brandished a chainsaw at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February, declaring it ""the chainsaw for bureaucracy. ""DOGE claimed to have slashed tens of billions of dollars in expenditures, but outside financial experts found it impossible to verify these claims because the unit never provided detailed public accounting.The agency's website still claims approximately $214 billion in savings, though a Politico review found the numbers were inflated by counting maximum possible contract values rather than actual spending reductions.The shut down follows Musk's public feud with Trump in May, after which Musk left Washington and exited DOGE. Musk's ""right-hand man,"" Steve Davis , also departed shortly after his boss's exit.By May, more than 200,000 federal workers had been laid off and roughly 75,000 had accepted buyouts.Former DOGE employees have moved to new positions throughout the administration. Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia now heads Trump's National Design Studio, tasked with beautifying government websites. So far, his design studio has launched websites to recruit law enforcement officers to patrol Washington, D.C., and advertise the president's drug pricing program.Edward Coristine, a DOGE employee nicknamed ""Big Balls,"" has also joined Gebbia's National Design Studio effort, encouraging his followers on X to apply to the new body.Acting DOGE Administrator Amy Gleason formally became an adviser to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in March, according to court filings, with her public statements largely focused on her HHS role. Zachary Terrell, part of the DOGE team given access to government health systems early in Trump's second term, is now chief technology officer at the Department of Health and Human Services, while Rachel Riley, who had similar access, now serves as chief of the Office of Naval Research.Jeremy Lewin, who helped Musk dismantle the US Agency for International Development, now oversees foreign assistance at the State Department. Scott Langmack, DOGE's representative at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, has been tasked by the White House budget office with creating custom AI applications to analyze US regulations and determine which ones to eliminate, according to his LinkedIn profile.The government-wide hiring freeze, another hallmark of DOGE, has also ended, with Kupor stating there is no longer a target for workforce reductions.Spokeswoman Liz Huston told Reuters only that Trump ""continues to actively deliver"" on reducing waste and fraud. Trump himself has begun referring to DOGE in the past tense in recent statements to reporters, subtly signaling its demise without formal acknowledgment.","Department of Government Efficiency, led by Elon Musk, has been shut down with eight months remaining on its charter.

A group of airline catering workers held a protest near Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) on Tuesday.They picketed along Century Boulevard and outside the airport’s pickup and drop-off points.Union leaders said the protest was part of their push to “hold Flying Food Group accountable,” reported Fox 11.

Xi STUNNED As Taiwan Declares 'No Return To China'; Japan 'SCHOOLS' Beijing | Big War Looms?





Takaichi, who became leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party last month, said Trump had requested their call and “provided an explanation of the recent state of US-China relations,” as reported by Financial Times.She said they discussed strengthening the Japan-US alliance and issues across the Indo-Pacific. “President Trump told me that I am a very close friend of his and that I should feel free to call him at any time,” she said.Her comments came as China reacted strongly to statements she made earlier this month, when she told parliament that a Chinese attack on Taiwan could be viewed as an “existential threat” to Japan, potentially allowing Japan’s Self-Defense Forces to respond. China, which claims Taiwan as its territory, denounced her remarks and signaled retaliation by blocking Japanese seafood imports, canceling joint events, and warning its citizens against traveling to Japan.The row deepened after Takaichi said in a major foreign-policy address that a Chinese attempt to blockade or seize Taiwan would be a “direct threat” to Japan’s security and pointed to the country’s mutual defense treaty with the US.Beijing’s response was immediate. Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi accused her of sending a “shocking wrong signal” and crossing a “red line.” China’s embassy in Tokyo summoned Japan’s ambassador, and the PLA warned of a “crushing defeat” for any Japanese involvement in a Taiwan conflict.Tensions also framed Monday’s 45-minute call between Xi and Trump. According to China’s Xinhua news agency, Xi raised Taiwan and stressed the importance of “Taiwan’s return to China.” The call was their first since meeting in South Korea in late October. Trump made no mention of Taiwan in his public comments, focusing instead on trade following the one-year truce both leaders reached in the US-China trade war.Analysts say Beijing is appealing directly to Washington to influence Japan’s position. Rorry Daniels of the Asia Society Policy Institute, as cited by Financial Times, said Xi was making a “direct appeal” to Trump and that China “often wants Washington to handle its friction with US allies,” hoping the US can “achieve what Chinese invective has not — a softening or ‘correction’ of Japan’s position.”","Sanae Takaichi, leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, said Trump requested their call.

All eyes on Chennai consulate after US diplomat's major expose





Former US Rep and economist Dr Dave Brat trained the guns at India over the H-1B visa program and said that while the national cap for H-1B is 85,000, one Indian district got 220,000 H-1B visas which is 2.5 times the limit.

Siddiqui revealed a shocking figure and claimed that 80-90% of the H-1B visas from India are fake -- either they have fake degrees or some other forged documents or they are not highly skilled as to be deserving an H-1B visa.Siddiqui said she was posted to the Chennai consulate from 2005 to 2007 when she adjudicated at least 51,000 H-1B visas. The Chennai consulate processed applications from four regions: Hyderabad, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, she said, adding that Hyderabad was the most concerning as Hyderabad's Ameerpet had shops not only consulting candidates on visa but providing them with forged documents -- be it an educational certificate or a marriage certificate.Siddiqui said she and the team she was working with quickly learned the fraud pattern and flagged it to the administration but there was a lot of political pressure.

TL;DR Driving the news

'Necessary Response At Proper Time': Taliban Vows Action After 10 Killed In Pak Strikes

What changed: The 27th Amendment





Passed in five days without broad consultation, the amendment:

Created a new Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) - removing constitutional jurisdiction from the Supreme Court.

Gave the president power to transfer judges - effectively coercing judicial loyalty.

Handed lifetime immunity to the president and military chiefs - beyond the reach of courts.

Eliminated the post of Chairman Joint Chiefs and established a Chief of Defence Forces - placing all services under Field Marshal Asim Munir.

Why it matters





A civilian-military consolidation of power unseen since the days of General Pervez Musharraf.

The official death of judicial independence, according to resigning justices and legal experts.

A reshuffling of Pakistan's political DNA - where the army writes the script, judges act the scenes, and a veiled mystic, Bushra Bibi , remains a ghost in the wings.

, remains a ghost in the wings. “We are facing completely uncharted territory,” warned constitutional lawyer Asad Rahim Khan.

The big picture: A triangle of power





Field Marshal Asim Munir: commander of all armed services, architect of the new order.

Imran Khan: jailed, disqualified, but symbolically invincible.

Bushra Bibi: spiritual advisor-turned-political wife, whose journey from Pakpattan to Islamabad may yet reshape the battlefield.

Together - or more accurately, against each other - they define Pakistan’s struggle between civilian populism, military dominance, and spiritual mysticism.

The new triumvirate: The general, the pirni & the cricketer





Asim Munir: The new pharaoh

All armed services via the new title Chief of Defence Forces

The nuclear command (transferred from civilians)

His own legal protection, via lifetime immunity

Parliament, by proxy of pliant coalitions

“Field marshals don't retire. They may leave a post, but they remain field marshal for life.” Shuja Nawaz on Munir

Imran Khan: Popularity in captivity





His party, despite rigging, won 93 out of 266 seats in 2024 elections.

His speeches are censored, yet his words circulate like sacred scripture.

His rivals - from Shehbaz Sharif to Zardari - struggle to match his moral authority.

Bushra Bibi: The mystic in the mirror





Predicted Khan’s rise to power - prompting their 2018 secret marriage.

Selected cabinet appointments by reading photographs.

The ISI angle





Bushra behind bars





Unlawful marriage (violating the Islamic waiting period)

Saudi gifts corruption scandal

Land deal redirection for an Islamic university

Yet none of these - even when supported by leaked audios and courtroom theatrics - have cracked public perception.

“Bushra has not made herself my weakness,” Khan said from his cell. “Her bravery has made me stronger.”

Between the lines





This is not just a crisis of governance - it’s a recasting of Pakistan’s founding vision.

From constitutional democracy to executive-military command

From judicial review to judicial obedience

From public representation to spiritual symbolism

What’s next





Munir had been due to retire in 2027. Now, he is set to oversee the 2028 elections, installing loyalist judges and neutering opposition.

What if Khan compromises - freeing himself and Bushra in exchange for political silence.

Then there is the risk of popular backlash erupting-driven by youth, lawyers, and civil society.

For now, the regime holds the cards. But as with every overreach in Pakistan’s history - from Zia to Musharraf - backlash often comes not as revolution, but as decay.

Bottom line





The Field Marshal cannot be arrested

The Supreme Court cannot speak

The President cannot be questioned

And the people’s vote barely matters





On paper, the 27th Constitutional Amendment is 59 clauses of dense legalese. In practice, it reads like a character study of three people: a jailed former cricket hero, his mystic wife, and a general-turned-field marshal who now enjoys lifetime immunity.On November 14, 2025, Pakistan enacted the 27th Constitutional Amendment - a sweeping legal overhaul that granted lifetime immunity to President Asif Ali Zardari and Field Marshal Asim Munir , while transforming the judiciary into an executive-led structure.Two Supreme Court judges resigned. Opposition parties stormed out of Parliament. And somewhere in a prison cell in Adiala, Imran Khan , Pakistan’s most popular politician, began writing a letter - alone, without books or newspapers.“Parliament has done what previous dictators could only dream of,” said legal analyst Mirza Moiz Baig.“This is autocratic legalism,” warned Aqil Shah of Georgetown University. “In no other democracy is the army chief of staff the designated joint service chief,” Shah told AFP.The 27th Amendment isn’t just constitutional tinkering. It represents:In a scathing editorial, Dawn argued that “with this, the separation of powers and basic structure established by the 1973 Constitution of Pakistan - which envisioned an independent judiciary and armed forces subservient to the civilian dispensation - now stands terminated.”It noted the irony that “instead of the military, an independent judiciary has been amended away into a subservient department of the executive branch. ”“The funeral rites for the judiciary have been performed,” said the editorial.Pakistan’s new regime is no longer about parties. It’s now a triumvirate:Munir rose through the ranks as quartermaster general and Corps Commander Gujranwala, then as head of Military Intelligence and, eventually, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). In 2019 he was removed as intelligence chief “just eight months into his stint, under then-prime minister Imran Khan and for reasons that have never been made public.”That sacking is widely seen in Pakistan as the first major clash between Munir and Imran Khan.Now elevated to Field Marshal, Asim Munir controls:“He probably has as much power as Musharraf,” said military analyst Shuja Nawaz. “Like Musharraf, he has a subservient prime minister and the authority to reshape the army's structure,” Nawaz told AFP.And unlike Musharraf, Munir doesn’t wear the scars of a military coup - he wears constitutional legitimacy.Former Prime Minister Imran Khan - held in solitary confinement, his party symbol banned, and facing dozens of legal cases - still commands unmatched national support.“He is still seen as Pakistan’s moral sovereign,” noted a leading historian.But behind bars, choices are narrowing. Some in PTI want compromise. Bushra Bibi, too, is reportedly inclined toward negotiation.As per a profile of Bushra Bibi in the Economist, by the mid-2010s, Imran Khan was at a personal and political low. Then came the introduction to Bushra Manika, a middle-aged woman from Punjab with a reputation as a Sufi-inclined spiritual guide. Their relationship began with late-night phone calls, before turning into visits to her family home in Pakpattan. According to 1843, Bushra’s then-husband, Khawar Manika, initially enjoyed the glamour but became uneasy as his wife’s intimacy with Khan grew. He recalled asking: “Why can’t we sit together?” and described walking into rooms to find conversations abruptly cut short.Manika later told 1843 that his wife had shared a prophecy with Khan: if they married, he would become prime minister. She divorced Manika at the end of 2017 and married Khan in a secret ceremony on January 1st 2018. Khan later told a British newspaper, “Sufism is an order with many levels, but I have never met anyone who is as high as my wife.”As per the Economist, few first ladies in modern history have combined veiled mysticism, political access, and whispered intrigue quite like Bushra Bibi.Once a pirni from Pakpattan, she:“Her interference was absolute,” a member of Imran Khan’s cabinet told the Economist.“He cannot see beyond that Sufi halo she carries around her,” added close friend Salman Ahmad.Per the Economist’s reporting, ISI officers allegedly used a pir to funnel intelligence to Bushra, who then passed it to Khan as revelations from dreams - reinforcing her mystical power and his trust in her.“Faiz was feeding information to Bushra Bibi through her pir,” confirmed ex-ally Faisal Vawda.“That’s how Khan started getting blinded.”But what the spy agency built, it later dismantled. When Khan sacked Asim Munir as ISI chief in 2019, allegedly after he raised corruption concerns about Bushra, the seeds of retaliation were planted.Bushra Bibi now shares Khan’s fate - imprisoned, silenced, and at the center of three separate cases:“No ordinary Pakistani will remain unaffected,” Dawn warned.“When the state is tried by a court that it has hand-picked, the citizen will lose every time.”This crisis leaves Pakistan at a crossroads:This isn’t just about one amendment, or one general, or one mystic wife. It’s about a state remade in secret, then rubber-stamped in Parliament, where:But still, whispers from prison echo across Pakistan - from Khan’s letters to Bushra’s mysticism and protests.(With inputs from agencies)",The 27th Amendment to Pakistan's constitution was passed in five days without broad consultation.

Xi STUNNED As Taiwan Declares 'No Return To China'; Japan 'SCHOOLS' Beijing | Big War Looms?





US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said that he shares a strong personal rapport with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping and added that he plans to travel to Beijing in April next year.Speaking to reporters during a press gaggle aboard Air Force One, Trump referred to his recent outreach to global leaders and expressed optimism over future cooperation with China.“I think we will be pleasantly surprised by the actions of President Xi. I have a great relationship with him. I like him. He likes me. I will be going there in April,” Trump said.The US President also recently held talks with Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi as part of his ongoing diplomatic outreach in Asia, highlighting close US-Japan ties and shared economic goals.Detailing his recent diplomatic conversations, the US President said, “I had a great talk.

I just came back from Japan, and we have a great relationship, the new Prime Minister and myself. She’s very smart, she’s very strong, and she’s going to be a great leader.”Trump’s remarks came a day after he and President Xi held a telephone conversation in which the two leaders discussed a wide range of issues, including trade ties, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, fentanyl controls, soybeans and other agricultural products.The phone call, according to both Washington and Beijing, was aimed at maintaining the positive momentum since their meeting in South Korea last month and ensuring stability in bilateral dialogue.Officials who were briefed on the conversation said both leaders reiterated their willingness to keep communication channels open as they navigate areas of cooperation and contention.In a detailed Truth Social post on Monday, Trump had already hinted at renewed engagement, describing the call with Xi as “very good” and revealing that the Chinese President had invited him to visit China in April.Reaffirming confidence in bilateral ties, he wrote: “Our relationship with China is extremely strong!”Trump added that Xi would later travel to the United States for a state visit, in what would mark another high-level meeting aimed at sustaining economic momentum between the two largest economies.""Since then, there has been significant progress on both sides in keeping our agreements current and accurate. Now we can set our sights on the big picture. To that end, President Xi invited me to visit Beijing in April, which I accepted, and I reciprocated where he will be my guest for a State Visit in the U.S. later in the year.

Resources aimed at White parents

Watchdog group raises concerns





A University of Minnesota webpage has described a “whiteness pandemic” in the United States and says people raised in the country grow up inside this culture.The page, run by the Culture and Family Lab under the Institute of Child Development, says White adults have a responsibility to “self-reflect, re-educate” and take antiracist action because of the “power and privilege” they hold.The site tells visitors that if they were taught the “culture of Whiteness” as children, it is not their fault. But it says adults must now examine their behaviour and work on building a “healthy positive White identity.” It adds that racism should be seen as an epidemic, but claims a deeper “whiteness pandemic” drives it.It says: ""If you were socialised into the culture of Whiteness during childhood, it is not your fault, but as an adult it is now your responsibility to self-reflect, re-educate yourself, and act. If you are a White adult, antiracist action involves an ongoing process of self-reflection in order to develop a healthy, positive White identity while engaging in courageous antiracist parenting/caregiving.""The page lists several experts and links to material “especially for White parents,” including references to George Floyd’s death and steps to understand racial identity.It describes whiteness as a cultural system built on colourblindness, passivity and “White fragility,” calling them covert forms of racism.The site argues that families play a major role in shaping this culture from childhood.One paper on the site, based on a survey of mostly liberal White mothers with high incomes, says family socialisation into this culture “perpetuates US racism” and reflects an “insidious Whiteness pandemic.” The project receives funding from multiple sources, including the National Institute of Mental Health.Other resources include work by Ibram X Kendi and Robin DiAngelo, and a guide on explaining white privilege to children.Parents’ rights group Defending Education published a report on Tuesday highlighting the university’s material. Its research director, Rhyen Staley, told Fox News that such programmes show how deeply DEI ideas are embedded in higher education.He said “absurd ideas like ‘whiteness’” gain legitimacy through “activist-academic scholarship,” and urged universities to stop these efforts.Last month, it was reported that the university was also providing K-12 teachers with ethnic studies lessons that promote causes such as defunding the police, Black Lives Matter and warnings about “white supremacy” and “settler colonialism.”","A University of Minnesota webpage describes a “whiteness pandemic” in the United States.

Candace Owens On Feminism, Zionism, Who Assassinated Charlie Kirk?





American political commentator and podcaster Candace Owens talked about feminism again on November 18, 2025, when she sat down on Myron Gaines’ podcast. She started the talk with one strong point. She said there was one moment in her life when she stopped liking feminism, and that moment came from her college days. This was the most important thing she shared in the interview. She said she had to take a class called “Women’s Studies,” also known as “Feminism 101.”She said she went into the class thinking feminism was about equality. But she said the class was very different from what she believed. Candace Owens said her teacher kept blaming men for every problem in the world. She said the class felt like it was made to “teach women to hate men.” She said that day in class made her question everything she believed about feminism.Candace Owens told Myron Gaines that her teacher did not talk about real equality. She said the teacher blamed men for “every problem in society.” Candace Owens said she felt shocked because the class was not about learning. She said it felt like her teacher wanted students to see men as the cause of every issue.Candace Owens also spoke about her past eating disorder. She said her teacher even blamed men for that. Candace Owens said this was not true and not fair. She said this moment made her feel the class was like a “psychological program” that tried to change what she believed.According to The Guardian, Candace Owens has become a very strong and polarizing voice in the last five years. The Guardian said she has spoken against the Black Lives Matter movement and the #MeToo movement. The Guardian also reported that she talked about the Blake Lively–Justin Baldoni issue and repeated false claims about Brigitte Macron.Later in the interview, Candace Owens spoke about critics who call her a “hypocrite.” She said people should not compare their life to hers. She said her life is “exceptional,” so people should not use her choices as a rule. She also said women should not think money alone means success.Candace Owens also talked about her kids, her thoughts on Donald Trump, his current administration, and the killing of activist Charlie Kirk. These came later in the talk and were not the main part of her story.Also Read: Candace Owens Raises Big Questions About Michael McCoy And Claims TPUSA Tried To Lift Him As New Charlie Kirk After Shooting","Candace Owens talked about feminism again on Myron Gaines’ podcast.

LIVE: Trump and Mamdani meeting at the White House (FULL)





New York governor Kathy Hochul on Monday said her advice helped Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani navigate his first high-stakes meeting with president Donald Trump , a meeting that ended on a surprisingly friendly note and eased fears of federal intervention in New York City.Hochul said she spoke to Mamdani before he visited the White House on Friday. She told him he needed to show Trump that he had firm control over the city and could be trusted to handle safety and governance without outside pressure. According to her, it was important to give the president “confidence” so he would not send the National Guard into the city.“He has already hit the ground running,” Hochul said at a press event in the Bronx, reported New York Post. “And I have the confidence in him that I wanted the president to have as well: that we don’t need any interventions,” she added,The meeting produced an unusual scene in the Oval Office. Trump openly praised Mamdani, a Democratic socialist who has publicly called him a “fascist”.The president also stepped back from his threat to deploy the National Guard after Mamdani assured him that crime control would remain a priority. He also told Trump he planned to keep NYPD commissioner Jessica Tisch in place.“I expect to be helping him, not hurting him, a big help because I want New York City to be great,” Trump said.Hochul also said she encouraged Mamdani to look for areas where he could work with Trump.She pointed to her own talks with the president, which she said helped push forward the long-delayed Penn Station redevelopment.However, Hochul stopped short of saying that Trump would drop his threat to cut federal funding for the city. She noted only that the outcome of Friday’s meeting had reduced tension.“I believe we are in a better place this Monday than we were Friday going into that meeting,” she said. “The president had a chance to see someone, as I have, who has the capacity and the vision that the city needs at this time.”Hochul added that Mamdani called her the day after his White House visit to thank her for the guidance.“I told him I thought he did everything he needed to do to make sure the president has confidence in his leadership,” she said.","New York governor Kathy Hochul said her advice helped Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani navigate his first high-stakes meeting with president Donald Trump.

(This is a Reuters story)





WASHINGTON/KYIV: Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Tuesday Kyiv was ready to advance a US-backed framework for ending the conflict with Russia and discuss disputed points with US President Donald Trump. Zelensky said the talks should include European allies.In a speech to what are known as the coalition of the willing allies, Zelensky urged European leaders to hash out a framework for deploying a ""reassurance force"" to Ukraine and to keep backing Kyiv for as long as Moscow showed no inclination to end its invasion. US and Ukrainian officials have been trying to narrow the gaps between them over Trump's plan to end the war, with Ukraine wary of being strong-armed into accepting a deal largely on Russian terms, including territorial concessions.""We firmly believe security decisions about Ukraine must include Ukraine, security decisions about Europe must include Europe ... Because when something is decided behind the back of a country or its people, there is always a high risk it simply won't work,"" Zelensky said, according to his speech text. ""That framework is on the table, and we're ready to move forward together - with the USA, with the personal engagement of President Trump,"" Zelensky added.A Ukrainian diplomat cautioned that territorial concessions remained a major sticking point, meaning a final deal was far from certain despite accords on various specific points. ""These are really tough questions for us,"" the diplomat said.Separately, Trump told a White House event he thought a deal on Ukraine was getting close but gave no other details, saying only: ""We're going to get there."" Zelensky could visit the US in the next few days to finalise a deal with Trump, Kyiv's national security chief Rustem Umerov said earlier on Tuesday, though there was no immediate confirmation of such a trip from the US side.Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov on Tuesday said an amended peace plan must reflect the ""spirit and letter"" of an understanding reached between Putin and Trump at Alaska summit. ""If the spirit and letter of Anchorage is erased in terms of the key understandings we have established then, of course, it will be a fundamentally different situation.""Kyiv's message hinted that an intense diplomatic push by the Trump govt could be yielding some fruit but any optimism could be short-lived, as Russia stressed it would not let any deal stray too far from its own objectives.US army secretary Dan Driscoll met with Russian officials in Abu Dhabi on Monday and Tuesday, a spokesperson for Driscoll said. A Ukrainian official said Kyiv ""supports the plan's essence, and some of the most sensitive issues remain as points for talks between presidents.""White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on X that over the past week, the United States had made ""tremendous progress toward a peace deal by bringing both Ukraine and Russia to the table.""

Trump To FIRE Kash Patel As FBI Director? White House Denies, Slams ‘FAKE’ MS NOW Report

White House says Patel is working tirelessly

Kash Patel to remain FBI director till December 15?





President Donald Trump and his top aides have grown increasingly frustrated by the 'unflattering headlines' FBI director Kash Patel has recently generated and Trump is considering removing Patel as FBI director, MS NOW reported, citing three people with knowledge of the situation. The name of Andrew Bailey is also being discussed as the new FBI director, the report claimed. Bailey is a top FBI official who served as Missouri's attorney general before his FBI posting. He is a US veteran who was posted to Iraq as an armored cavalry officer.MAGA turned against their once-favorite Patel as Kash Patel did not live up to his past Epstein claims, to begin with. He was a staunch believer that sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was killed in custody and promised a full release of the Epstein Files. But after becoming the director, Patel changed his stance and said after seeing the video footage from the prison, he was now certain that Epstein committed suicide.Patel's girlfriend Alexis Wilkins stole the limelight amid the Epstein controversy as Patel-haters started calling Alexis a Mossad agent who honeytrapped Patel.Patel was also criticized for using government jets for his personal use, which is nothing unusual, as FBI directors are not allowed to fly commercial because of security reasons.But Patel's frequent visits to his girlfriend's events, his shielding of his girlfriend, did not go down well with MAGA who eventually started claiming that Alexis is a 'honeypot'.As Alexis sued MAGA influencers for spreading the Israeli theory through Kash Foundation, MAGA cried foul that the FBI director was using his clout against MAGA activists. It was also came to be reported that Patel deployed elite SWAT teams for his girlfriend's security as she received numerous death threats.White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson responded to MS NOW, saying, “President Trump has assembled the most talented and impressive Administration in history and they are doing an excellent job carrying out the President’s agenda. FBI Director Patel is a critical member of the President’s team and he is working tirelessly to restore integrity to the FBI.”“I do have confidence in Kash, a lot of confidence, and the DOJ,"" Trump said in an interview last week.The MS NOW report calculated that Bailey can become the acting diretor of the FBI without Senate confirmation only after serving in his current senior leadership post for at least 90 days. He was appointed on September 15 and could begin working as acting FBI director any time after December 15.On Tuesday, Patel was present at the White House for the annual pardoning of the Thanksgiving turkeys where Trump publicly commended him, adding that he was “very busy doing a great job.” When several people applauded, the president added, “See, you’ve got a following, Kash.”","MAGA turned against their once-favorite Patel as Kash Patel did not live up to his past Epstein claims, to begin with.

Japan PM FLEXES ‘Friendship’ With Trump Amid Brawl With Xi Jinping Over Taiwan | ‘Can Call Him…’





China’s leader Xi JinPing and US President Donald Trump solidified their “G-2” compact on Monday with mutual invitations of high-level visits even as Beijing, embroiled in a fresh spats with Japan and India, pressed its claims on Taiwan with little pushback from Washington.In a 45-minute phone call, China’s President Xi ratcheted up the Taiwan issue after Japan’s new leader Sanae Takaichi, in her first major foreign policy address since taking office in September, declared that a Chinese attempt to blockade or seize Taiwan would constitute a ""direct threat"" to Japan's security and and invoked the country’s mutual defense treaty with the US.Xi-Trump telecon followed immediately, with Beijing asserting it underscored that Taiwan’s return to China is an integral part of the post-war international order and warning against external interference that could destabilize the Asia-Pacific. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian elaborated in a briefing that Xi emphasized the ""one-China principle"" as non-negotiable, framing it as essential for mutual trust.Trump’s post on the call completely omitted any reference to Taiwan that China said it raised, and instead focused on trade issues and improvement in ties. Some experts interpreted it as a US retreat in the face of China increasing pressure on the Taiwan front after seeing Washington throw Ukraine under the bus.“I just had a very good telephone call with President Xi. We discussed many topics including Ukraine/Russia, Fentanyl, Soybeans and other Farm Products, etc. …Our relationship with China is extremely strong!...President Xi invited me to visit Beijing in April, which I accepted, and I reciprocated where he will be my guest for a State Visit in the US later in the year,” Trump said in a rah-rah post on social media, with no mention of the discussion on Taiwan.Hours after the Xi call, Trump spoke by phone with Takaichi, affirming ""close cooperation"" between Washington and Tokyo on Indo-Pacific security. The White House described the exchange as productive, touching on supply chain resilience and joint exercises, but offered no specifics on Taiwan.The sequencing suggests Trump adopting a strategy of balancing great-power engagement with China – which he has repeatedly characterized as G-2 – without alenating allies, though critics say it could embolden Beijing's assertiveness. Several U.S analysts are warning that Xi is “playing” Trump and “stringing him along” after the latter’s threat to unleash an economic fusillade on China turned out to be bluster.“Xi has secured Trump’s commitment to several meetings in 2026, as well as concessions from the administration on incredibly contentious issues: Taiwan and US export controls. By every measure, China is diplomatically, strategically, and technologically better off than it was a year ago,” Foreign Affairs commentator Jonathan Czin wrote. Commentators also cautioned that Trump’s transactional diplomacy prioritizing economic concessions over strategic commitments in the Indo-Pacific risks alienating allies and partners like Japan and India.Trump has repeatedly talked up US-China relations – and his personal equation with Xi – in recent days even as several US analysts say Washington has come out worst in the fight the US President picked with Beijing. “This call was a follow up to our highly successful meeting in South Korea, three weeks ago. Since then, there has been significant progress on both sides in keeping our agreements current and accurate. Now we can set our sights on the big picture,” Trump said in his post on Monday, even as Beijing was was re-litigating a dispute with New Delhi over the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh.The latest spat between China and Japan began when Takaichi, who was elected last month, told lawmakers that a hypothetical Chinese attack on self-ruling Taiwan, which at its closest point is about 70 miles from Japanese territory, could threaten Japan’s survival and trigger a military response from Tokyo.Beijing's response was swift and severe. Foreign Minister Wang Yi accused Takaichi of sending a ""shocking wrong signal"" by openly contemplating military intervention, labeling it a ""red line"" crossed. China's embassy in Tokyo summoned Japan's ambassador, and the PLA issued warnings of a ""crushing defeat"" for any Japanese involvement in a cross-strait conflict.The feud escalated to the United Nations on November 22, where China's envoy condemned Japan's stance as ""provocative meddling."" State media amplified the rhetoric, with the Global Times editorializing that Tokyo's ""reckless words"" echoed US ""hegemony"" and risked war.","China's leader Xi JinPing and US President Donald Trump solidified their “G-2” compact on Monday with mutual invitations of high-level visits.

‘Memoir Misused’: JD Vance’s bestselling book used to smuggle drugs into an Ohio prison,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/memoir-misused-jd-vances-bestselling-book-used-to-smuggle-drugs-into-an-ohio-prison/articleshow/125570022.cms,"How JD Vance’s bestselling book was used in a smuggling scheme

'Ukrainian Victory A Fantasy': JD Vance Publicly Humiliates Zelensky & EU; 'Can't Stop Russia...'

A sentence handed down in federal court





Vice President JD Vance’s bestselling memoir, Hillbilly Elegy, has found itself at the centre of an unexpected and ironic criminal case after authorities revealed that a copy of the book was used to smuggle drugs into an Ohio prison. According to court documents, narcotics were sprayed onto the pages of the memoir and shipped to an inmate disguised as a standard Amazon delivery, turning a work about addiction, hardship and recovery into an unlikely tool for trafficking.The smuggling operation was carried out by 30-year-old Austin Siebert from Maumee, near Toledo. According to prosecutors, Siebert sprayed narcotics onto several items and then shipped them into the Grafton Correctional Institution disguised as ordinary Amazon purchases. Among those items was a copy of Hillbilly Elegy, the memoir written by Vice President JD Vance, along with a 2019 GRE handbook and a drug-treated sheet of paper. Because the chemicals can be absorbed into paper fibres, the drugs could be transported without appearing as powder, pills or residue, making the book itself the delivery method.The scheme came to light after investigators intercepted the package and tested the materials, leading to Siebert’s arrest.A recorded phone conversation between Siebert and the inmate confirmed the connection, with the inmate asking whether the package was “Hillbilly,” referring directly to Vance’s memoir, and Siebert responding evasively before acknowledging the reference. The exchange helped prosecutors establish that the book was intentionally used as part of the smuggling plan.Siebert was sentenced on 18 November to more than 11 years and eight months in prison by US District Judge Donald C Nugent. The length of the sentence reflects the seriousness with which federal authorities treat drug trafficking within correctional facilities, where narcotics contribute to violence, coercion, medical emergencies and corruption.Officials have said the case highlights increasingly inventive smuggling tactics, particularly those exploiting books, mail and printed materials that are difficult to screen without damaging them.Hillbilly Elegy, published in 2016, chronicled Vance’s upbringing marked by family instability, addiction and economic decline in Appalachia. The memoir became a major bestseller, spent more than a year on The New York Times list, and was later adapted into a film directed by Ron Howard. It also played a key role in shaping Vance’s public profile and political ascent, offering insight into the cultural landscape that fuelled Donald Trump’s rise.A book examining the impact of substance abuse was repurposed as a vehicle for drug trafficking and has added a striking layer of irony to the saga, which many have pointed out.",Hillbilly Elegy was used to smuggle drugs into an Ohio prison. narcotics were sprayed onto the pages of the memoir and shipped to an inmate disguised as a standard Amazon delivery.

Fundraising leverage, given Republicans’ historic weakness in New York financial networks

Base turnout in swing regions, especially Long Island and Hudson Valley House districts

Neutralises Stefanik’s core attack narrative

Highlights fractures inside the Republican messaging machine

Reinforces Democratic claims that Stefanik is extreme and fear-mongering

What could happens next

Trump could reverse himself at any moment.

Mamdani remains openly critical of Trump, calling him a fascist.

The dynamic could shift suddenly and explosively.

Stefanik is in damage containment mode

Hochul has political breathing room

Democrats amplify the contradiction

Republicans hope voters forget





President Donald Trump’s unexpectedly warm Oval Office exchange with New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani has thrown a political wrench into Rep. Elise Stefanik’s ambitions to become governor of New York, undermining the core message of her campaign and exposing the risks of relying on Trump while running in a deep-blue state.Stefanik has spent months framing her 2026 gubernatorial bid around portraying Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul and Mamdani as ideological extremists who threaten public safety and affordability. Her messaging has leaned heavily on branding Mamdani as radical, anti-Israel and even linked to Islamist extremism, including calling him a “jihadist.”However, Trump’s meeting with Mamdani, surprisingly friendly and free of confrontation, demolished Stefanik’s narrative in real time. Mamdani, who will become New York City’s youngest mayor and its first Muslim and first South Asian leader, was praised by Trump as “a very reasonable person,” with the president saying he would feel entirely safe living in New York under Mamdani’s leadership. The refusal to echo Stefanik’s attack line marked a rare and public break with one of his most loyal MAGA allies.Stefanik now faces a political bind unlike other Republicans because she must remain aligned with Trump even when he contradicts her. She relies on him for:At the same time, her campaign must attract suburban moderates, Jewish voters and independents, blocs deeply sceptical of Trump.His approval in New York remains heavily negative, making him both an asset and a liability.Political strategists note that Stefanik’s rise through the Republican ranks was powered by fierce loyalty to Trump, particularly during his first impeachment, making public divergence unusually risky. Analysts also warn that Trump’s transactional style, turning abruptly on allies like Marjorie Taylor Greene, adds instability to Stefanik’s 2026 prospects.Meanwhile, Hochul benefits without lifting a fingerGovernor Kathy Hochul gains by default from the Trump Mamdani moment because it:Democrats have already begun framing Stefanik as out of touch with New Yorkers, pointing to Trump’s rejection of her rhetoric as proof that her claims about Mamdani lack credibility. They also see an opening among Jewish voters who may dislike Mamdani’s positions but reject Stefanik’s language.New York is expected to be decisive in the 2026 midterms. Several battleground House seats in Long Island, Staten Island and the Hudson Valley will help determine whether Republicans retain control of the House. GOP leaders had hoped Stefanik would serve as a unifying top-of-ticket force, but Trump’s embrace of Mamdani has rattled that strategy.Republicans still plan to use Mamdani nationally as a symbol of far-left Democratic politics, yet Trump’s praise muddies that messaging. Even MAGA influencers acknowledged that Democrats could use clips of the meeting to damage Stefanik.Most analysts agree on three things:For now:The Trump-Mamdani “bromance” has become more than a viral political oddity. It now represents the clearest example of how Trump’s unpredictability can derail even his closest protégés.
