Ukraine says Russian strike hit Indian pharma firm Kusum healthcare's warehouse: What we know so far,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ukraine-says-russian-strike-hit-indian-pharma-firm-kusum-healthcares-warehouse-what-we-know-so-far/articleshow/120245952.cms,"Photo credit: X/@MartinHarrisOBE

Here's what we know so far about the incident:

What happened?

Poll Do you believe the missile strike on Kusum Healthcare's warehouse was a deliberate attack? No, it was accidental Yes, it was deliberate

What's the response of Indian and Russian government?



Kusum Healthcare’s presence in Ukraine



Conflict continues despite ceasefire talks

Amid the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, a warehouse belonging to an Indian pharmaceutical company was allegedly struck by a Russian missile in Ukraine on Saturday in what the Ukrainian embassy in India described as a ""deliberate attack.""The Ukrainian embassy in India said on Saturday that a Russian missile had hit the warehouse of Kusum Healthcare , an Indian pharmaceutical company operating in Ukraine.""Today, a Russian missile struck the warehouse of Indian pharmaceutical company Kusum in Ukraine,"" the Ukrainian embassy said in a post on X.In the same post, the embassy added: ""While claiming 'special friendship' with India, Moscow deliberately targets Indian businesses -- destroying medicines meant for children and the elderly.""So far, no additional details have been shared about the damage or casualties from the strike.The Indian and Russian governments are yet to comment on the matter.Martin Harris, the UK's ambassador to Ukraine, also claimed that Russian strikes destroyed a ""major pharma's warehouse in Kyiv"". However, his post did not mention whether the warehouse belongs to Kusum and also said the attack was carried out by Russian drones and not a missile.The governments of India and Russia have not yet issued any statements regarding the incident.Meanwhile, Martin Harris, the British ambassador to Ukraine, also said that Russian strikes had destroyed a ""major pharma’s warehouse in Kyiv."" However, he did not specify whether the warehouse belonged to Kusum Healthcare. He also mentioned that the attack was carried out using Russian drones, not a missile.""This morning Russian drones completely destroyed a major pharmaceuticals warehouse in Kyiv, incinerating stocks of medicines needed by the elderly and children. Russia's campaign of terror against Ukrainian civilians continues,"" Mr Martin said in a post on X.According to its official website, headquartered in Delhi, Kusum Healthcare operates in 29 countries, including Ukraine, Moldova, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Ivory Coast, Benin, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Niger, Cameroon, Mali, and Tanzania.The company is among several Indian firms with a business presence in Ukraine, particularly in the pharmaceutical sector.Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, both countries have continued to exchange strikes. Although they agreed last month to stop targeting each other’s energy facilities, each side has accused the other of violating the agreement.India has maintained that dialogue is the only path to peace and has not taken sides in the conflict, even while keeping good relations with both Kyiv and Moscow.In a podcast interview with Lex Fridman last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he would urge the presidents of both countries to seek a peaceful resolution, saying, ""I can sit with (Russian) President (Vladimir) Putin and say it's not the time for war. I can tell (Ukraine) President (Volodymyr) Zelenskyy in a friendly way that brother, regardless of how many people stand with you in the world, there will never be a resolution on the battlefield.""Despite the ongoing conflict, India has continued to buy large quantities of oil from Russia, which has been available at discounted rates due to Western sanctions and reduced demand from Europe. Russia has remained India’s top oil supplier, with India importing 1.48 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil from Russia in February, down from 1.67 million bpd in January.","A warehouse belonging to an Indian pharmaceutical company was allegedly struck by a Russian missile in Ukraine on Saturday.

OP Jindal University: Girl smuggled into university hostel in suitcase,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/girl-smuggled-into-university-hostel-in-suitcase/articleshow/120245456.cms,"Poll Do you think the university's disciplinary action is justified? No, it was just a harmless prank. Yes, it was a serious breach of rules.

GURGAON: A video from OP Jindal University in Sonipat - featuring a girl emerging out of a suitcase like a magician's escape - went viral on social media, with many describing it as a boy's 'Romeo-and-Juliet' style attempt to smuggle his love into his hostel. The university said it was prank gone too far and was taking action against the students.Although the video - which surfaced Saturday - does not show any boy in it, sources at the university said one had indeed sneaked into the girls' hostel.It was not immediately clear if this was linked to the suitcase incident.According to Anjoo Mohun, director of communications at the university, the video shows a group of girl students moving their friend around the hostel in a large suitcase as part of a ""light-hearted"" joke.""This was a prank, entirely confined to the premises of the girls' hostel. The suitcase was carried into a public area within the hostel, where security personnel monitoring CCTV footage noticed suspicious activity and intervened. When they opened the suitcase, they found a girl inside,"" she said.With the video spreading far and wide - and attracting a volley of reactions - the university promised disciplinary action against every student involved in the 'prank'. On Saturday evening, the students had received show-cause notices, asking them to appear before a disciplinary committee by the end of this month.The university emphasised that student safety remained a top priority. ""We're treating the matter seriously. While no one was harmed, such actions can raise security concerns and have unintended consequences,"" it said in a statement.The university also urged people to refrain from sharing ""unverified information"" and respect the ""privacy and dignity"" of the students involved.But through the day, the video drew a mix of reactions on social media.Many were quick to criticise the strict restrictions that compel couples to resort to such extreme measures. ""The length that people need to go to just to get some private time with their loved ones in this country is so dehumanising,"" one user wrote.Others took a lighter approach. ""On the bright side, he carried her alive,"" one posted. Some could not resist poking fun at the risks involved. ""Itna bada risk kaun leta hai?"" one remarked, questioning why the couple did not opt for an affordable hotel instead.",A video from OP Jindal University in Sonipat went viral on social media.

However, he acknowledged that he was supplied with grounds of arrest by NIA in writing.The special judge, considering Rana's request that any lawyer assigned to represent him should not seek to earn fame through him, directed the legal aid counsel (LACs) not to speak to the media about the accused of this case.If the details of legal services counsel are not already known to the media, they shall not be divulged, he further directed.",Tahawwur Hussain Rana was one of the first accused to be arrested in the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack.

"Inspired by Pakistan, US statutes, SC sets bill passage deadline",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/inspired-by-pakistan-us-statutes-sc-sets-bill-passage-deadline/articleshow/120241788.cms,"Poll Do you support the Supreme Court's decision to impose a time limit on governors for bill assent? No, it undermines the governor's authority. Yes, it's necessary for democratic processes.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court drew inspiration from provisions in the constitutions of Pakistan and the US in specifying timelines for governors in giving assent, returning or referring to President the bills passed by state assemblies, and said time-limit breach is amenable to judicial scrutiny.The 415-page magnum opus of a judgment by Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan, pronounced on April 8 but uploaded on SC's website Friday, justified its decision to give purposive meaning to the words 'as soon as possible' in the Constitution for governors or the President in taking decision on bills passed by assemblies or Parliament.Writing the judgment, Justice Pardiwala gave omnibus scrutiny powers to SC, and said, ""No exercise of power under the Constitution is beyond the ambit of its judicial review. Thus, we find no reason to exclude discharge of functions by governor or President under Articles 200 & 201 of the Constitution, respectively.""The first question that arose before SC was whether the court had jurisdiction to step beyond the written words of the Constitution to prescribe a time-limit for the governor. It did so by drawing inspiration, first from its own judgment in 2021 prescribing a three-month outer-limit for Speakers to adjudicate pleas seeking disqualification of MLAs under anti-defection law.The other inspiration came from constitutions of Pakistan and the US. Justice Pardiwala said, ""For instance, Article 75 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan or Article I, Section 7 of the US Constitution , where if no decision is taken within the stipulated time limit by President, then bills are deemed to have been assented to.""Article 75 of Pakistan's constitution provides a 10-day period for the President to either assent or return a bill to Majlis-e-Shoora (parliament). If the returned bill is re-passed with or without amendment, then the president is bound to give assent to it within 10 days, beyond which the bill is deemed to have received his assent. But the court was aware that ""unlike many countries across the globe wherein a provision for deemed assent upon the expiry of the specified time period has been made, there is no such provision in our Constitution"". At the same time, it mentioned that during Constituent Assembly debates, Dr B R Ambedkar had proposed a six-week time limit for governors on this issue and that both the Sarkaria and Punchhi commissions had favoured a time limit.Thus, in the case of TN, SC had to resort to its potent Article 142 powers to rule that the long-delayed 10 bills passed by the assembly, on which the governor had dilly-dallied for months, would be deemed to have got his assent, and declared that his decision to refer them to the President after their re-passing by the assembly is illegal. It said any decision on such referred bills by the President would also be void. Sans a time limit, governors could play spoilsport for democracy where an elected govt gets five years to implement policies and election promises, SC said. ""Not taking any action on bills for an unreasonable and prolonged period of time virtually vests the governor with the power of pocket veto and it can't be held to be permissible within our constitutional scheme,"" SC said.",The 415-page magnum opus of a judgment by Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan was pronounced on April 8 but uploaded on SC's website Friday. It justified its decision to give purposive meaning to the words 'as soon as possible' in the Constitution for governors or the President in taking decision.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120241800,imgsize-50612,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

NEW DELHI: At least three people were killed in West Bengal’s Murshidabad district as protests against the Centre’s Waqf (Amendment) Act spiraled into violence over the weekend, prompting chief minister Mamata Banerjee to declare that the law will not be implemented in the state.The recently enacted Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025, has triggered a wave of protests and legal confrontations across India, with political parties, religious organizations, and civil society groups voicing concern over its implications for minority rights and religious freedoms.ALSO READ: What is Waqf (Amendment) Bill? All you need to know While the Centre has defended the legislation as a historic reform, critics claim it enables state overreach into Muslim endowments and threatens the secular fabric of the Constitution.From courtroom battles in Delhi and Calcutta to violent street protests in Bengal and Rajasthan, here’s a detailed look at the top developments:Shortly after the Calcutta High Court approved the deployment of central forces in riot-hit Murshidabad, Union home secretary Govind Mohan stated that apart from nearly 300 Border Security Force personnel locally available in Murshidabad, additional five Companies have been deployed at the request of the state sovernment.Mohan, who held a video conference with Chief Secretary and DGP of West Bengal, advised the state administration to keep a close watch on other sensitive districts also, and to put in place adequate steps to ensure normalcy at the earliest.He also stated that the Centre is closely monitoring the situation and assured the state all possible assistance including deployment of additional manpower, if necessary, the ministry of home affairs said in a statement.The West Bengal DGP briefed that the situation was tense but under control and was being monitored closely. The DGP further stated that he is taking the assistance of BSF posted locally, and that more than 150 persons have been arrested, the MHA said.A father and son, were killed in West Bengal's Murshidabad district after violent clashes, reportedly linked to ongoing protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act.The victims were found with multiple stab wounds inside their home in Jafrabad, a locality in the violence-stricken Samserganj area. The family claims that miscreants looted their house before fatally stabbing the two.In a separate incident, another individual suffered a bullet injury earlier in Dhulian, Samserganj. The district has seen widespread unrest, with large-scale violence erupting on Friday in Samserganj and Suti areas during protests against the contentious law.ALSO READ: Calcutta HC intervenes, ‘We cannot stay silent’; deploys central forces amid Waqf Act protests The state has so far arrested 118 individuals linked to the unrest. While officials initially said one person had sustained a bullet injury, Additional Director General (Law and Order) Jawed Shamim later confirmed two deaths, without clarifying whether police firing was involved. He suggested the possibility of shots being fired from the BSF side but said the source was still under investigation.""These are early reports that we need to cross-check,” Shamim said, adding that the injured were receiving treatment and that the situation remained tense.The Calcutta high court on Saturday ordered the deployment of central paramilitary forces in West Bengal’s Murshidabad district following large-scale violence during protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act. The decision came after a special hearing was held on a court holiday in response to a petition filed by Leader of the Opposition and BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari.“In view of the large-scale communal riots spreading like wildfire across West Bengal, I had sought immediate intervention from the state government for the requisition of central paramilitary forces. The state government did not accept it. With no other option, I approached the High Court for an urgent hearing,” Adhikari said after the order.A division bench comprising Justice Soumen Sen and Justice Raja Basu Chaudhary heard the matter and accepted his plea, ordering immediate deployment of central forces in the violence-hit areas.Mamata Banerjee has made it clear that her government will not implement the Waqf (Amendment) Act in the state, amid spiraling violence in Muslim-majority districts like Murshidabad. “We did not make this law. It was brought by the Centre. So what is the riot about?” Mamata asked in a post on X.“We do not condone any violent activity. My appeal to all religions: remain calm and restrained. Do not fall prey to provocation,” Mamata said, accusing “some political parties” of misusing religion for political gain.Four rounds were reportedly fired by police on Friday, injuring two. Vehicles were torched, roads blocked, and stones hurled at police in districts like Malda, South 24 Parganas, and Hooghly. DGP Rajeev Kumar said strong action would follow and urged people not to fall for ""rumour mongering.""Meanwhile, political leaders have sharply reacted to the ongoing violence.BJP MP Sudhanshu Trivedi commented on the passage of the Waqf (Amendment) Act, calling the protests in West Bengal a political ploy. ""After completing all the constitutional procedures in a systematic manner, the Waqf Bill came to Parliament, was discussed by the JPC, and passed by both Houses. It then received the President's approval and became law. Yet, some are using it for political gain. It is sad that this is happening only in West Bengal. This raises the question if Mamata Banerjee’s politics is becoming a challenge for the entire country,"" he said.In response to the growing violence, West Bengal Leader of Opposition Suvendu Adhikari moved the Calcutta High Court, seeking deployment of central forces in the state. “With communal riots spreading rapidly across West Bengal, I sought immediate intervention from the state government for central paramilitary forces. When the state government didn’t act, I approached the High Court for urgent intervention. My plea has been accepted, and the division bench will hear the PIL,” he said.Adhikari also wrote to the railway minister demanding an NIA probe into vandalism in Murshidabad, alleging a “premeditated assault by jihadist forces.”“This wasn’t protest—it was an attack on democracy and governance,” Adhikari posted on X.ALSO READ | President Droupadi Murmu gives assent to Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2025 State BJP chief Sukanta Majumdar said the TMC government was enabling the unrest through appeasement. “When BJP comes to power, we will crush such vandalism in five minutes,” he warned.After Friday prayers, the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) staged a peaceful protest in Jaipur's Bhatta Basti area to oppose the Waqf (Amendment) Act. Rajasthan AIMIM chief Jameel Khan alleged that the legislation is an attempt by the Centre to take control of Waqf assets and marginalize Muslims.“This legislation is not about reform, but about reinforcing a broader agenda of exclusion and injustice against Muslims,” said Khan. “We will continue to assert our democratic right to peaceful protest and also launch a public awareness campaign.”Khan said that their demonstration aimed to urge citizens and lawmakers alike to reassess the broader impact of the amendment on minority rights and social harmony.The Congress party has pledged to challenge the Act, calling it a violation of the Constitution’s basic structure.“The law is part of a broader agenda to polarize the country on religious lines,” said Congress leader Swadesh Sharma.“Just as public sector units were sold off to industrialist friends, this law seeks to gift donated lands to a few.”Several Muslim organizations, including the Jamiat Ulema-i-Hind and Indian Union Muslim League, have announced plans to take legal recourse, while protests continue across states.Congress MP Imran Masood, commenting on the unrest, condemned the violence while emphasizing the fight for the Constitution. “We are staunchly against violence. This is not just a fight for Muslims but for the Constitution. The BJP trampled on the Constitution with the Waqf Act. This is about protecting the Constitution, not a political agenda,” he saidThe National Conference (NC), currently in power in Jammu & Kashmir, has petitioned the Supreme Court, calling the Act a ""constitutionally alarming interference"" in Muslim religious affairs. NC MLAs Arjun Singh Raju, Hilal Akbar Lone, and others filed a writ on April 11.“On the directions of Party President Dr Farooq Abdullah... our MLAs have filed a writ petition seeking justice,” the NC posted on X.Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna's bench is set to hear a clutch of similar petitions on April 16. Other challengers include AIMIM's Asaduddin Owaisi, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, SDPI, AAP's Amanatullah Khan, and civil rights organizations.In contrast, Hindu Sena president Vishnu Gupta filed an intervention application in support of the Act, arguing that the original Waqf Act enabled wrongful claims on non-Muslim property.“The unamended provision of the Waqf Act, 1995, caused serious prejudice to the rights and interests of non-Muslims,” read the plea.The plea contends that the 2025 amendment restores justice to non-Muslims whose properties were allegedly misclassified as Waqf assets.In Bhopal, MP Waqf Board chairman Sanwar Patel said the board is preparing to serve notices to nearly 2,000 people for illegal occupation of Waqf properties.“Out of 15,008 Waqf properties in the state, most are occupied. We’ll ask them to vacate or become legal tenants, failing which action will follow under the new law,” Patel told ANI.He accused several Congress leaders, including a national president and AIMIM chief Owaisi, of occupying such properties. Patel also cited an RRC (Revenue Recovery Certificate) of Rs 7.11 crore against Congress leader Riyaz Khan.","The recently enacted Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025, has triggered a wave of protests and legal confrontations across India. At least three people were killed in West Bengal’s Murshidabad district as protests against the Act spiraled into violence over the weekend.

After the post-mortem found signs that she had been killed by strangulation, police interrogated the woman's husband, who confessed to the crime, stating that he was drunk after attending a party and had an altercation with his wife, which led to the murder.Police received a control room alert on March 6 about an alleged hanging death. On reaching the spot at K Block in Mahipalpur, the police team found that a woman named Kalpana, aged 28, had hanged herself. Her body had already been taken down by her family members and taken to a Vasant Kunj hospital, where she was declared brought dead. The deceased had married Amit Kumar Sehrawat about six years ago, and she had a five-year-old child from the marriage. He is employed by a private company in Gurgaon.Proceedings under Section 176 (inquiry by magistrate into cause of death) of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita were carried out. The statements of Kalpana's parents were recorded before the tehsildar of Vasant Kunj, in which they and other relatives stated that there was a quarrel between Kalpana and her husband but they didn't level any allegations about dowry torture. Police sources said that on March 8, the post-mortem of the deceased was conducted at Safdarjung Hospital. The medical team that carried out the autopsy opined that ""death is due to asphyxia consequent upon ante-mortem ligature strangulation. However, viscera is preserved to rule out any concomitant poisoning. All the injuries are ante-mortem in nature. Injury Nos. 2 to 11 are a result of blunt force impact"".The parents of the woman were informed about the findings and a case was registered. An investigation was initiated.

He had an altercation with his wife after he became heavily intoxicated and was dropped at his house by his cousin. After a while, Kalpana too returned home, upon which Sehrawat began quarrelling with her about some domestic issues. He beat his wife, and during the scuffle, he strangled her. Finding that she had died, hanged his wife's body with a rope made of multicoloured cloth, the cops said. He then acted as if his wife Kalpana had hanged herself.

Hisar: Outpatient services were disrupted for two hours across Haryana on Saturday as doctors staged a symbolic protest against the suspension of Hisar’s deputy civil surgeon and PNDT nodal officer, Dr. Prabhu Dayal . Members of the Haryana Civil Medical Service (HCMS) wore black badges and shut down OPDs from 10 am to 12 noon in solidarity.Dr. Dayal was suspended following a sting operation conducted by a private news channel, which featured claims made by brokers allegedly involved in illegal fetal sex determination.

Following the meeting, the association submitted a memorandum to chief minister Nayab Singh Saini, urging him to intervene and revoke the suspension.HCMS General Secretary Dr. Anil Yadav said that members were unanimous in their disapproval of the action against Dr. Dayal. “Dr. Prabhu Dayal has consistently performed his duties with integrity and dedication. He has been recognized multiple times by the government for his exemplary service. Despite this, he was suspended abruptly on the night of April 9 without any explanation or prior inquiry,” he stated.The association expressed deep concern over the incident and announced that a delegation would soon meet senior officials to discuss the issue. Letters have also been sent to the additional chief secretary (health), home minister, and the chief minister demanding immediate withdrawal of the suspension order.","Outpatient services were disrupted for two hours across Haryana on Saturday.

Quote

BENGALURU: In a shocking incident that unfolded a couple of days ago near Jalahalli Cross Junction in West Bengaluru, a BMTC (Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation) bus driver allegedly assaulted a motorcyclist, causing a severe injury to his private part. The victim, identified as Suraj (name changed), is a 30-year-old sales representative residing in Banashankari 3 Stage. The victim is currently undergoing treatment and may require surgery if he does not respond to medication.According to Bagalagunte police, the incident occurred on April 8, when Suraj was returning from his work. While riding near the T Dasarahalli Metro station on Tumakuru Road, he encountered a BMTC bus, bearing registration number KA-57-AF-4319, which abruptly swerved from the left lane to the right without signalling. Suraj, who was riding besides the bus, nearly lost control of his bike due to the sudden lane change.According to Suraj, the bus driver appeared to be arguing with a passenger at the time. Angered over the reckless driving, Suraj approached the bus and suggested that the driver be more cautious and considerate of other road users. However, the situation quickly escalated. ""The driver began shouting at me in abusive language, and told me to ride carefully. I initially tried to reason with him, but when he continued to hurl insults, I responded in the same tone and decided to leave the spot,"" Suraj told TOI.What followed thereafter was a disturbing turn of events. The bus driver allegedly began chasing Suraj, aggressively manoeuvring the bus in a way that nearly collided with the bike multiple times. ""He was screaming at me to stop and drove dangerously close to my bike. I was terrified,"" Suraj recalled. Unfortunately, the traffic signal at Jalahalli Cross turned red, forcing Suraj to stop. That's when the driver jumped out of the bus and physically attacked him, he said.""He came running, pushed me, and then kicked me hard on my private part. I fell to the ground in excruciating pain. He tried to kick me again, but I managed to block him. Commuters intervened and stopped him, but not before he threatened to kill me if I ever dared to offer advice again,"" said Suraj, who has been traumatised by the BMTC driver's assault.Barely able to ride, Suraj approached traffic police at the junction. The Hoysala police vehicle took him to the station, where they advised him to seek medical treatment first. Suraj was later admitted to a hospital, where doctors found a swollen left testicle with internal bleeding. He was placed under observation and may need surgery if the clot does not heal.A senior police officer confirmed that a case has been registered at Bagalagunte police station under BNS sections 115 (voluntarily causing hurt), 126 (wrongful restraint), 351 (criminal intimidation), and 352 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace). ""A notice will be issued to the driver. We are investigating the incident and will take appropriate action based on the findings,"" the officer stated.The case has reignited concerns over driver behaviour and passenger safety in Bengaluru's public transport system. When TOI contacted BMTC, they were unavailable for comments.","The victim, identified as Suraj (name changed), is a 30-year-old sales representative.

A million mark: The number behind Trump's deportation push,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/a-million-mark-the-number-behind-trumps-deportation-push/articleshow/120246583.cms,"<p>A million mark: The number behind Trump's deportation push</p><p><br></p>

Poll Do you support the Trump administration's goal of deporting 1 million immigrants within the first year? No, I oppose it. Yes, I support it.

As US President Donald Trump resumes his presidency, his administration is reportedly targeting an unprecedented immigration crackdown, with a goal of deporting up to 1 million immigrants within the first year, according to multiple federal officials familiar with internal planning.According to a report from The Washington Post, the figure, which far exceeds previous records, has become a frequent reference point in behind-the-scenes discussions, although the administration has yet to publicly detail how the numbers are being calculated. Under former President Barack Obama, annual deportations peaked at just over 400,000.Experts and former officials have cast doubt on the feasibility of the goal, citing significant legal, logistical, and financial hurdles. Most undocumented immigrants in the US have a legal right to court proceedings before removal, a process that often takes months or even years due to extensive backlogs in the immigration system.White House adviser Stephen Miller has reportedly been holding near-daily meetings with officials from the department of homeland security (DHS) and other agencies to push the plan forward. One avenue under consideration includes deporting some of the estimated 1.4 million immigrants who already have final removal orders but remain in the country because their home nations have refused to accept them.In a bid to work around that obstacle, the administration is negotiating with up to 30 countries to accept non-citizen deportees, often referred to as third-country removals . Officials confirmed that immigrants have already been deported to nations such as Mexico, Costa Rica, Panama — and in one recent instance, Rwanda, following negotiations.If fully implemented, this would be the largest deportation effort in US history. A DHS spokesperson said more than 117,000 deportations had been carried out by late March, combining arrests made by immigration and customs enforcement (ICE) inside the country and those made by customs and border protection (CBP) at entry points. The agency claims these figures do not include individuals who have voluntarily left the US.Still, immigration analysts say the numbers fall well short of the administration's 1 million target. Doris Meissner, a senior fellow at the migration policy institute and former US immigration commissioner, said ICE is projected to deport around 212,000 people this fiscal year — fewer than the 271,000 removals last year, most of which followed illegal border crossings.Detentions are at capacity, with more than 47,000 individuals in custody in late March. Deportation flights are on the rise but only marginally — from about 100 in January to 134 in March, a 15 per cent increase. ""It would be just a massive, massive increase to reach 1 million removals,"" said Tom Cartwright, an advocate who tracks deportation data. ""I don't know where those numbers are coming from.""Meanwhile, the administration has reportedly leaned on high-profile operations, transferring detainees to facilities in El Salvador and Guantánamo Bay — moves viewed by insiders as more symbolic than impactful.A multi-agency push involving the FBI, DEA, and ATF is underway to locate and detain individuals with final deportation orders. Still, morale among immigration officers is reportedly flagging amid persistent pressure and skepticism about achieving the administration's goals.""They say it jokingly: 'We’ve got to get a million removals.' That's their goal,"" said one former official.On the legal front, the administration has encountered pushback. Federal judges have blocked attempts to deport immigrants without proper hearings, particularly in cases involving removal to third countries. In one instance, a Salvadoran man was mistakenly deported despite a court order protecting him due to threats from gangs in his home country.In response to growing legal scrutiny, DHS Secretary Kristi L Noem issued guidance mandating that before any third-country deportation, officers must secure ""diplomatic assurances"" ensuring the person will not face torture or persecution. Immigrants must be informed of their destination and allowed to raise objections. If fear is expressed, they must undergo a screening by US citizenship and immigration services, typically within 24 hours — a timeframe criticised by immigration lawyers as inadequate.While the Trump administration has refrained from publicly confirming the 1 million figure, spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement that the government is acting on a mandate from voters to overhaul the immigration system. ""The entire Trump administration is aligned on delivering on this mandate, not on arbitrary goals,"" he said, framing the efforts as focused on removing ""terrorist and criminal illegal aliens.""Despite the rhetoric and ramped-up enforcement, analysts and former officials alike remain unconvinced the administration can hit its aspirational target. ""This isn't just a switch you can flip,"" Meissner said. ""The deportation process is complex and resource-intensive.""","US President Donald Trump is reportedly targeting an unprecedented immigration crackdown.

As trade tensions with the two countries escalate, AI-generated videos and memes are going viral.Specifically, these memes target President Donald Trump and his advisers, including Elon Musk and JD Vance. One such viral meme video mocks the idea of American workers returning to garment factories, sparking debate about tariffs and the US manufacturing. The one shared by DogeDesigner is a political cartoon from the Chinese Embassy in the US, depicting the US as a bully forcing China to accept a lollipop while threatening with a spiked bat, symbolizing coercive diplomacy amid escalating US-China trade tensions .Over the past week, tariffs imposed by the US on Chinese imports have increased from 54% to 104% and then to 125%, in addition to existing duties from before President Trump’s second term. In response, China has raised tariffs on US imports from 84% to 125%, effective April 12, 2025.Recently, Donald Trump announced a two-tier tariff structure: a baseline 10% tariff applied universally to imports from all countries, with exceptions for Canada and Mexico, and additional country-specific ""reciprocal"" tariffs based on what the administration deemed unfair trade practices by approximately 60 individual nations. The 10% baseline tariff began on April 5, 2025, while the higher country-specific rates commenced on April 9, 2025.","Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has responded to the ongoing China and US-meme war on Twitter.

Alhurra , a US-funded Arabic-language news network created in 2004 to offer an American perspective in the middle east, will stop broadcasting and lay off most of its staff following the Trump administration's move to halt financial transfers to government-backed media outlets, including Alhurra’s parent company, the Middle East Broadcasting Networks (MBN).The network was launched in the aftermath of the US invasion of Iraq to counter anti-American sentiment in Arabic media, especially that from Al-Jazeera, writes news agency AFP. Alhurra reached over 30 million viewers weekly across 22 countries but struggled to compete with well-established networks like Al-Jazeera, Al-Arabiya, and Sky News Arabia.Jeffrey Gedmin, MBN’s president and CEO, criticised the funding cut, saying it leaves the field open to extremist narratives. “It makes no sense to kill MBN as a sensible alternative,” Gedmin said. He added that the Trump administration, particularly Kari Lake—the official overseeing US international broadcasting—refused to meet with him or address concerns over what he calls “unlawfully” blocked funds.""I'm left to conclude that she is deliberately starving us of the money we need to pay you, our dedicated and hard-working staff,"" he wrote.Gedmin also said Alhurra would stop broadcasting but attempt to continue limited digital operations with a significantly reduced team.The shutdown is part of a broader budget reduction effort, reportedly influenced by Elon Musk, which has already affected other US-funded outlets like Voice of America and Radio Free Asia. Some organisations, such as Radio Free Europe, are now looking for support from foreign governments to survive.","Alhurra, a US-funded Arabic-language news network, will stop broadcasting and lay off most of its staff.

SAO PAULO: Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro was transferred Saturday by medical aircraft from northeastern Brazil to the capital Brasilia after being hospitalized with abdominal pain a day earlier.Bolsonaro was hospitalized Friday morning while traveling in northeastern Brazil. The pain was caused by a bowel obstruction and was related to long-term effects of being stabb ed in the abdomen in September 2018, his doctors said.Bolsonaro has been in and out of hospitals since the attack at a campaign event before Brazil's 2018 presidential election. The conservative leader underwent several surgeries during his presidency from 2019-2022.""After so many similar episodes over the past few years, I had gotten used to the pain and discomfort. But this time, even the doctors were surprised,"" he said in a social media post Saturday, adding that a longtime physician told him it was ""the most serious case since the attack.""Bolsonaro also said he would likely undergo another surgery. Earlier on Saturday, doctors at Rio Grande Hospital in the northeastern state of Rio Grande do Norte told journalists he was stable and not in need of emergency surgery, said further procedures would depend on his recovery.Doctors also that the transfer to Brasilia was requested by his family and would happen Saturday afternoon.The far-right leader was admitted to a hospital in Santa Cruz, a small city in Rio Grande do Norte, and later transferred to a hospital in the state's capital, Natal. Bolsonaro was set to start a trip across the region to promote his party's right-wing agenda, eyeing next year's presidential election, though he himself is barred from running.

The US is seeking a nuclear accord quickly, according to Iran's statement following exceptional discussions on Saturday, whilst US President Donald Trump warns of potential military intervention if negotiations fail.The discussions were led by Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi, a veteran diplomat who helped craft the 2015 agreement, and Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff. These talks represent the highest-level nuclear negotiations between Iran and the US since the previous agreement's termination.Araghchi engaged briefly with Witkoff, a property developer, during the otherwise indirect meeting in Oman, and announced that talks would continue next Saturday. ""The American side also said that a positive agreement was one that can be reached as soon as possible but that will not be easy and will require a willingness on both sides,"" Araghchi informed Iranian state television, as quoted by AFP.""I think we came very close to a basis for negotiation... Neither we nor the other party want fruitless negotiations, discussions for discussions' sake, time wasting or talks that drag on forever,"" he continued.Meanwhile, the White House described the discussions as ""very positive and constructive"". ""Special Envoy Witkoff's direct communication today was a step forward in achieving a mutually beneficial outcome,"" their statement read. When questioned about the talks, Trump responded aboard Air Force One: ""I think they're going OK. Nothing matters until you get it done.""Earlier statements from both sides indicated their positions: Trump expressing desire for Iran's prosperity whilst preventing nuclear armament, and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's adviser Ali Shamkhani emphasising Iran's pursuit of ""a real and fair agreement"".This comes as US and Iran, without diplomatic ties for over four decades, are negotiating a fresh nuclear agreement after Trump withdrew from the previous one in 2018.The earlier nuclear agreement of 2015 was intended to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons while allowing it to maintain a civilian nuclear programme. Following the United States' unilateral withdrawal from the deal in 2018 under then-also President Donald Trump, Iran increased its nuclear activities.Recent reports from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) show that Iran has enriched uranium to significant levels. Under the original agreement, Iran was restricted to maintaining minimal quantities of uranium enriched to 3.67 per cent. Currently, however, its uranium reserves are sufficient to construct several nuclear weapons if desired, with some portions enriched up to 60 per cent—requiring only minor technical adjustments to reach weapons-grade levels. Based on discussions since the US withdrawal, Iran is expected to seek permission to continue uranium enrichment at a minimum of 20 per cent.The discussions occurred at a luxury Muscat hotel, the site of the 2015 agreement signed during Barack Obama 's presidency, though without visible indications of the high-level meeting.The Omani foreign minister facilitated this Muscat discussions, according to Iran. The American delegation had requested direct meetings. The diplomats spoke directly for ""a few minutes"", confirmed Iran's foreign ministry, noting the talks were held ""in a constructive and mutually respectful atmosphere"".The participants conducted negotiations from ""separate halls"", communicating through the Omani foreign minister, according to Iran's foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei's post on X. The Omani foreignmMinister Badr Albusaidi characterised the process as occurring in a ""friendly atmospere"".Iran is seeking sanctions relief whilst dealing with Israel's actions against its allies Hezbollah and Hamas. Despite Trump's stringent sanctions and military threats, Tehran agreed to participate while the US, aligned with Iran's adversary Israel, aims to prevent Tehran from developing nuclear capabilities.","Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi and Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff hold high stakes talks.

The Trump administration confirmed on Saturday that Kilmar Abrego Garcia , a Maryland resident mistakenly deported last month, remains confined in a notorious prison in El Salvador but did not provide the full scope of information demanded by a federal judge regarding efforts to bring him back.In a court filing submitted, US state department official Michael G Kozak said that Abrego Garcia is currently being held in the Terrorism Confinement Center in El Salvador, reported news agency Associated Press.“He is alive and secure in that facility. He is detained pursuant to the sovereign, domestic authority of El Salvador,” wrote Kozak, identified in the filing as a “Senior Bureau Official” in the Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs.However, Kozak’s statement failed to address US district judge Paula Xinis’s additional directives. On Friday, the judge had ordered the administration to disclose not only Abrego Garcia’s “current physical location and custodial status” but also “what steps, if any, defendants have taken (and) will take, and when, to facilitate” his return.Xinis had expressed deep frustration over the government’s lack of transparency. “I’m not asking for state secrets. All I know is that he’s not here,” she said during a tense court hearing on Friday, adding, “The government was prohibited from sending him to El Salvador, and now I’m asking a very simple question: Where is he?”As per AP, Friday’s hearing exposed the administration’s failure to provide even basic information about Garcia's whereabouts or the plan for his return, prompting Xinis to demand daily updates from a US official with direct knowledge of the case.Garcia, 29, was deported in March despite a 2019 federal court ruling that prohibited his removal due to the likelihood he would face persecution in El Salvador. The deportation, which was later admitted by a US immigration official to be an “administrative error,” sent him to El Salvador’s CECOT prison , a high-security facility known for holding dangerous criminals.Garcia’s deportation occurred under a $6 million agreement between the Trump administration and the Salvadoran government. The deal allowed US authorities to detain and transfer migrants to Salvadoran custody.","Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident mistakenly deported last month, remains confined in a notorious prison in El Salvador.

News Wrap: Israel cuts off Rafah as it expands military activity in Gaza

Israel announced on Saturday that it would expand “rapidly” across much of Gazahad after completing building a new security corridor cutting off the southern city of Rafah from the rest of Gaza, reported news agency Associated Press.The corridor, called Morag, is named after a former Jewish settlement located between Rafah and Khan Younis. It has become a focal point since the Israeli army began mass evacuations in Rafah, hinting at plans for a large-scale assault.Rafah’s municipality has described the construction as a “flagrant breach of international legitimacy.” The corridors, coupled with a buffer zone that Israel has razed and expanded, give it more than 50% control of the territory.Israel says the military strategy is meant to pressure Hamas to release the remaining 59 hostages, of which 24 are believed to be alive. Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government has also enforced a blockade of food, fuel, and aid, which aid agencies say has left over 2 million people in dire need.Israeli airstrikes continued across Gaza on Saturday, killing at least 21 people in the last 24 hours, according to the health ministry in Gaza. The ministry says most of the over 50,000 Palestinians killed since October have been women and children, although it does not separate combatant from civilian deaths. Israel claims to have killed 20,000 Hamas fighters but has not provided proof.On Saturday, evacuations were ordered east of Khan Younis, and later in parts of central Gaza, after rocket fire from those areas. Hamas has warned that ongoing bombardments risk the lives of hostages. A new video was released showing American hostage Edan Alexander speaking under duress. His family issued a statement urging support for a deal to bring hostages home.In a new development, Israel's defence minister Israel Katz said Palestinians would have the option to “voluntarily” relocate abroad under a US-backed proposal by president Donald Trump. Palestinians have strongly rejected the idea, calling it forced displacement. Human Rights Watch and other organisations have labelled the plan as ethnic cleansing.","Israel has completed building a new security corridor cutting off the southern city of Rafah from the rest of Gaza.

Poll Do you believe the weather conditions contributed to the recent aircraft crash in upstate New York? No Yes

A twin-engine aircraft carrying two people crashed on Saturday in a muddy field in upstate New York, said Columbia County Undersheriff Jacqueline Salvatore, reported Associated Press. While she did not report any deaths, she said there was no damage to any structures.The federal aviation administration reported that the Mitsubishi MU-2B was en route to Columbia County Airport near Hudson but went down roughly 30 miles away, near Copake.Salvatore said that mud, weather conditions, and snow have made it hard for first responders to reach the crash site. The national transportation safety board said it has sent an investigation team, which is expected to reach New York by Saturday evening.According to New York Times, data from Flightradar24 shows a plane of the same model took off from Westchester County Airport in White Plains shortly after 11:30 a.m. It headed north before turning east near Hudson and disappearing from tracking near Copake minutes later.This comes a day after a sightseeing helicopter crashed into the Hudson river near the New Jersey shore on Thursday, killing all six people on board — including a Spanish family of five and the pilot, a US navy veteran.Recent months have seen multiple fatal crashes in US, including a midair collision and a medical plane crash.","A twin-engine aircraft carrying two people crashed on Saturday in a muddy field in upstate New York, said Columbia County Undersheriff Jacqueline Salvatore.

Nuclear talks: A new chance for US-Iran diplomacy? | DW News

How much is Iran willing to concede?



US President Donald Trump announced on Monday, April 7, 2025, that Washington and Tehran would begin talks over Iran's nuclear programme in Oman. Oman has acted as a mediator between the West and Tehran in the past. The two countries met in Muscat on Saturday, April 12, to explore the possibility of a new nuclear agreement.Iranian state television said on Saturday that Iran and the United States will hold another round of talks next week regarding Tehran's nuclear program. This came at the end of their first meeting since Donald Trump returned as president. According to Iranian state TV, US Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi ""briefly spoke"" with each other — the first direct contact between the two sides since the Obama administration. Iranian state media mentioned the face-to-face conversation, indicating the talks were proceeding in a positive direction.The White House issued a statement on Saturday afternoon saying the discussions were ""very positive and constructive,"" but also noted that the issues involved ""are very complicated.""""Special Envoy Witkoff's direct communication today was a step forward in achieving a mutually beneficial outcome,"" the White House said.Both the Iranian and American sides said the next round of talks will take place on Saturday, April 19.In 2018, President Trump withdrew the US from an earlier nuclear deal involving Iran and other world powers and reimposed economic sanctions. This move was strongly opposed by Iran.President Trump has also said that military action is possible if the talks do not lead to an agreement.Iran is not allowed to have nuclear weapons because it is a member of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which it signed along with most other countries. This agreement allows countries to use nuclear technology only for peaceful purposes, like energy, medicine, and agriculture. It strictly prohibits the development of nuclear weapons.Although Iran says its nuclear programme is only for civilian use, many countries and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) are not fully convinced. Concerns grew in 2002 when Iran was discovered to have secret nuclear facilities, which violated the NPT. This led to suspicion that Iran might be working toward building nuclear weapons, even though it continues to deny those claims.Moreover, countries like Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United States worry that if Iran gets nuclear weapons, it could lead to a nuclear arms race in the Middle East and, consequentially, more instability in the already turmoiled region.The US and its allies also see Iran as a threat because of its support for groups like Hezbollah and its opposition to Western influence in the region. Giving Iran access to nuclear weapons could make it harder to contain its regional power.The 2015 nuclear deal, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was an agreement between Iran and six world powers—the United States, United Kingdom, France, Russia, China, and Germany—aimed at preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons.Under the deal, Iran agreed to limit its nuclear programme by reducing its stockpile of enriched uranium, cutting the number of centrifuges, and allowing regular inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).In return, international sanctions on Iran were lifted, helping its economy and giving it access to global markets. However, in 2018, US President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal and reinstated sanctions, after which Iran began breaching some of the agreement’s terms.Since the United States left the nuclear agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in 2018 and brought back sanctions, Iran has responded by not following key parts of the deal.It has set up thousands of advanced centrifuges to enrich uranium, which the JCPOA had banned. To make nuclear weapons, uranium needs to be enriched to 90 per cent purity. Under the JCPOA, Iran was only allowed to keep up to 300kg of uranium enriched to 3.67 per cent , which is suitable for peaceful uses like energy and research.However, by March 2025, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said Iran had around 275kg of uranium enriched to 60 per cent. If enriched further, that amount could possibly be enough to make about six nuclear weapons. US officials believe Iran could produce enough material for one bomb in roughly a week, but actually making a usable weapon might take between one year and 18 months. Some experts believe Iran could put together a basic nuclear device in six months or even less.Before the 2015 nuclear deal, the UN, US, and EU had placed tough economic sanctions on Iran, suspecting it was trying to build a nuclear bomb. These sanctions blocked Iran from selling oil internationally and froze about $100 billion of its assets. This caused a deep recession and rising inflation in Iran.In 2015, Iran and six world powers (US, UK, France, China, Russia, and Germany) agreed to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which limited Iran’s nuclear activities and allowed international inspections. In return, the sanctions were lifted. The deal was supposed to last up to 15 years.However, when Donald Trump became US president in 2018, he pulled the US out of the agreement. He called it a ""bad deal"" because it wasn’t permanent and didn’t cover Iran’s missile programme. He re-imposed US sanctions as part of a “maximum pressure” strategy to push Iran into a new deal. Trump’s move was also supported by US allies like Israel, which claimed Iran was secretly continuing its nuclear programme and could use the money from sanctions relief to boost its military.The US, under President Donald Trump, is aiming to reach a new deal with Iran that goes beyond the 2015 nuclear agreement. Trump wants to prove he can negotiate a “better” deal, one that not only limits Iran’s nuclear programme more strictly but also addresses issues like ballistic missiles and regional influence.The goal is to ease tensions in the Middle East, especially between Iran and Israel, and prevent a wider conflict. Israel, meanwhile, remains deeply suspicious of Iran and wants any future agreement to fully eliminate Iran’s ability to develop nuclear weapons. ""The deal with Iran is acceptable only if the nuclear sites are destroyed under US supervision,"" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said this week. ""Otherwise, the military option is the only choice.""Both sides are approaching talks cautiously, given the deep mistrust after the US pulled out of the original JCPOA and imposed harsh sanctions on Iran.But what’s at Stake?The future of the original 2015 nuclear deal is hanging by a thread, especially with its strictest limits set to expire soon. If the agreement collapses completely, Iran could move closer to developing a nuclear weapon—raising fears of a nuclear arms race in the Middle East.This poses a direct threat to Israel and could destabilize the region further. There's also concern that Iran might share its nuclear know-how with militant or terrorist groups, intensifying global security risks. The outcome of ongoing talks could determine whether diplomacy prevails or tensions spiral toward conflict.While the US may offer sanctions relief to help revive Iran’s battered economy, Tehran is unlikely to give up its nuclear programme altogether. Since the US exit from the 2015 deal, Iran has expanded its uranium stockpile significantly, enriching some of it up to 60 per cent —just a short technical step from weapons-grade.One thing it won't do is give up its programme entirely. That makes the proposal of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of a so-called Libyan solution - ""you go in, blow up the facilities, dismantle all the equipment, under American supervision, American execution"" - unworkable, the news agency Associated Press reported.Iranians including Ayatollah Ali Khamenei have held up what ultimately happened to the late Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi , who was killed with his own gun by rebels in the country's 2011 Arab Spring uprising, as a warning about what can happen when you trust the United States.","US President Donald Trump announced on Monday, April 7, 2025, that Washington and Tehran would begin talks over Iran's nuclear programme in Oman.

Two faculty organisations at Harvard University filed a lawsuit on Friday against the Trump administration, claiming it is violating constitutional rights by threatening to cut billions in federal funding .The American Association of University Professors (AAUP) and its Harvard chapter are challenging the administration’s decision to review nearly $9 billion in federal funds given to the university over alleged antisemitism on its campus, reported New York Times.The lawsuit, filed in the US district court in Massachusetts, argues that the move undermines free speech and academic freedom protected under the first amendment. The groups have also requested a temporary restraining order to prevent any immediate withdrawal of funds.“This is an unlawful misuse of federal authority,” the lawsuit says. The professors argue that the government is using funding as a tool to punish institutions that do not align with president Trump’s views.The White House has not responded to the lawsuit or given further comments. Earlier, the administration accused Harvard of not doing enough to stop antisemitic incidents on campus. It claimed that the university had failed to protect its students and faculty.Alan Garber, Harvard’s current president, has acknowledged the concern around antisemitism and said the university has worked hard to address it over the past 15 months. However, no official comment has been made by Harvard regarding the lawsuit.Andrew Manuel Crespo, a Harvard law professor and counsel for the faculty group, said that the government’s actions are an attempt to limit academic speech. ""Harvard faculty have the constitutional right to speak, teach and conduct research without fearing that the government will retaliate against their viewpoints by canceling grants,"" Crespo said.","American Association of University Professors (AAUP) and its Harvard chapter are challenging the administration’s decision to review nearly $9 billion in federal funds given to the university.

Nearly 300 Delta Air Lines passengers arriving from Mexico endured an ordeal that turned a routine journey into a 20-hour travel nightmare after bad weather forced two international flights to divert to an airport unequipped to handle customs processing.According to The New York Post, Delta flights from Mexico City and Cabo San Lucas were both rerouted late Thursday night to Montgomery Regional Airport in Alabama after severe storms triggered a ground stop at their original destination, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport .However, Montgomery lacks a Customs and Border Protection facility, leaving passengers stuck onboard the aircrafts overnight.“It was supposed to be three-and-a-half hours, it turned out to be almost 20 hours,” said passenger Alex Alvarez to 11Alive. “Bad weather, we understand that. But things just kept piling up”, Alvarez added.Both flights landed around 10:30 pm (local time) and passengers were not allowed to deplane until after 5 am Friday. Even then, they were confined to roped-off sections inside the terminal under guard, with no formal customs clearance, according to People.com.“You are literally stuck on that airplane,” said Boston-bound passenger Lauren Forbes, who had to rebook her connection to Boston after the hours-long delay.Delta stated that ongoing lightning and storms prevented them from redirecting to nearby Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport, which does have customs and also delayed any deplaning in Montgomery.According to the Independent, flight crews had also exceeded their maximum allowed working hours, adding to the complications.Passengers were served minimal refreshments like cookies and water during the ordeal and many, including Forbes, expressed frustration over the lack of contingency plans. “I think this is just an eye-opener for maybe more substantial protocols in place,” she told Boston 25.A Delta spokesperson apologised for the incident in a statement, saying, “We sincerely apologize to our customers for this experience. We fell short of how we aspire to serve and care for our customers amid thunderstorms in the Southeast US” The airline confirmed that it has contacted affected customers and is offering full refunds for their bookings.According to The New York Post, Delta acknowledged the planes’ doors remained open throughout the tarmac delay and that passengers were eventually allowed to disembark in small groups before finally continuing on to Atlanta hours later.","Delta flights from Mexico City and Cabo San Lucas were both rerouted late Thursday night to Montgomery Regional Airport in Alabama.

Victor Perez , a 17-year-old nonverbal autistic teen with cerebral palsy who was shot nine times by police in Pocatello, Idaho, has died after being removed from life support, his family confirmed on Saturday.The teenager had been in a coma since the April 5 incident and was declared clinically brain dead on Friday, according to news agency Associated Press.Perez’s aunt, Ana Vazquez, said that the teen underwent several surgeries after the shooting, including the removal of nine bullets and an amputation of one leg, but doctors ultimately found no brain activity.The shooting occurred after police responded to a 911 call reporting that an “intoxicated man” was chasing people with a knife. The man turned out to be Victor, who was not intoxicated but staggered due to his disabilities.According to his family, he had found a kitchen knife during a family gathering and relatives were trying to take it from him.As per NBC News, officers arrived at the home and opened fire within about 12 seconds of exiting their patrol vehicles.A video recorded by a neighbor shows Victor lying in the yard before attempting to stand and stumbling toward officers while holding the knife. A chain-link fence separated him from the police when they began shooting.“Everybody was trying to tell the police, no, no,” said Vazquez. “Those four officers didn’t care. They didn’t ask what was happening, what was the situation”, she added.“How’s he going to jump the fence when he can barely walk?” she further asked.Victor’s death has sparked outrage across the Pocatello community, with protests already underway and a vigil held Saturday morning outside the hospital where he was treated.Pocatello Police chief Roger Schei said the officers issued commands for Victor to drop the knife and described the situation as one where “officers had to make a split-second decision.”However, the rapid escalation and use of lethal force without apparent de-escalation efforts have drawn widespread criticism.Pocatello Mayor Brian Blad released a statement expressing condolences, stating, “We recognize the pain and grief this incident has caused in our community.” He also emphasized that “criminal, external, and internal investigations” are underway and that the city is treating the matter with “the seriousness and thoroughness it deserves”.The Eastern Idaho Critical Incident Task Force is conducting the external review, and Bannock County Prosecutor Ian Johnson confirmed that once the investigation is complete, the report will be reviewed by an agency outside the county to ensure objectivity.The four officers involved remain on administrative leave. Their names have not been released.Victor’s family and advocates are now calling for justice and a broader re-examination of police response tactics involving individuals with disabilities.","Victor Perez, 17, a nonverbal autistic teen with cerebral palsy who was shot nine times by police in Pocatello, Idaho, has died after being removed from life support.

Poll Do you believe that Pakistan is adequately prepared for earthquakes? No Yes

A moderate-intensity earthquake with a magnitude of 5.8 struck Pakistan at around 1 pm on Saturday, with tremors felt in Jammu and Kashmir.Tremors were felt across many parts of the Valley, but there were no immediate reports of casualties or property damage. The earthquake occurred at a depth of 10 kilometres, with coordinates of 33.63 degrees North latitude and 72.46 degrees East longitude.According to the National Center for Seismology (NCS), the recent earthquake struck at a shallow depth of 10km, increasing the likelihood of aftershocks.Shallow earthquakes are typically more dangerous than deeper ones because the seismic waves travel a shorter distance to the surface, causing stronger ground shaking and potentially more damage to structures and higher casualties.Pakistan, located on the boundary of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates, is one of the most seismically active countries. The nation frequently experiences destructive earthquakes due to its position on major fault lines. Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, and Gilgit-Baltistan lie on the southern edge of the Eurasian plate, while Sindh, Punjab, and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir are on the north-western edge of the Indian plate. The collision of these plates makes the region highly susceptible to violent earthquakes.Earlier, Pakistan’s neighbor Tajikistan was also jolted by a 4.2 magnitude earthquake.","A moderate-intensity earthquake with a magnitude of 5.8 struck Pakistan at around 1 pm on Saturday, with tremors felt in Jammu and Kashmir.
