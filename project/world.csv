CBI checks call records of Sandip Ghosh and

Abhijit Mandal

KOLKATA: The CBI on Thursday questioned TMC youth leader Ashish Pandey , who is also a house staff at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, in connection with the rape and murder of the doctor, an officer said. Pandey was interrogated for several hours at the CBI's CGO Complex office before he left late in the night.Ashish Pandey is close to Sandip Ghosh and suspended doctor Avik De . Pandey had allegedly checked into a Salt Lake hotel on Aug 9.""Pandey's phone number was found in the call lists of several persons.He had checked in at a hotel in Salt Lake with a woman friend on the day the trainee doctor's body was found.

'Detonators' put on way of Army train set off alarm,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/detonators-put-on-way-of-army-train-set-off-alarm/articleshow/113578047.cms,"Since Aug this year, at least six alleged attempts have been made in UP to sabotage railway operations.

Cops: Train was carrying Army personnel and weapons

INDORE/KANPUR: In what seems to be yet more attempts to sabotage railway operations, it has come to light that railway ' detonators ' were placed on tracks in Madhya Pradesh 's Ratlam on September 18 when an Army special train was passing through. The revelation came on a day when an empty gas cylinder was found on the tracks at Prempur station near Uttar Pradesh's Kanpur.Since Aug this year, at least six alleged attempts have been made in UP to sabotage railway operations.In MP's Burhanpur district, the 10 'railway detonators' were found placed at intervals of a metre each. The railways called it an ""attempt at mischief"". The Army has requested custody of certain key railway personnel, including signalmen and trackmen, for questioning as part of the probe.Sources said a gangman has been detained but there is no official confirmation. He is alleged to have done this in a drunken rage.The train, headed for Thiruvananthapuram, was carrying Army personnel and weapons, police sources said. A couple of the detonators — more like firecrackers — exploded when the train passed over them. The loco pilot pulled the brakes the moment he heard the first explosion. The train was halted for half an hour at Sagphata station, while the area was inspected.“Ten railway detonators were placed over a 10m distance on the Mumbai rail route between Sagphata and Dongargaon railway stations,” Dr Swapnil Nila, chief public relations officer of Central Railway, told TOI.In the incident near Kanpur, the 5-litre cylinder was removed from the tracks by police after a thorough examination. “Around 5.50am, locopilots Dev Anand Gupta and C B Singh of the Jorhat-bound freight train spotted an empty cylinder on the tracks ahead of the signal. The crew promptly applied emergency brakes to avert a potential catastrophe,” read a statement issued by North Central Railway (NCR). Two empty beer cans and a snack wrapper were also found on the scene.“The cylinder was placed a mere 30m from the signal. Kanpur Police, RPF and GRP are investigating,” said Om Narayan Singh, SHO of Kanpur Central GRP. “Though the probability of derailment was minuscule as the train’s momentum would have likely propelled the cylinder away, the deliberate placement of the gas cylinder on the track indicates sabotage,” Kanpur police said.However, the incident near Ratlam in MP rang the alarm bells . Officers from NIA , the Army, anti-terrorism squad, railways and police inspected the site. “While it seems this was done without reason, an inquiry is being conducted by RPF,” said CPRO.","An empty gas cylinder was found on the tracks at Prempur station near Uttar Pradesh's Kanpur.

The memorandum cited demographic changes due to settlement of five lakh illegal Muslims between 1979 and 1983, which left indigenous population marginalised. It drew attention to historical injustices suffered by non-Muslim minorities in the region since Partition.","Thirteen Chakma organisations in Mizoram, including political parties, sent a memorandum to PM Narendra Modi Sunday.

Die is cast: Hindu refugee families from Pakistan to vote first time since 1947,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/die-is-cast-hindu-refugee-families-from-pakistan-to-vote-first-time-since-1947/articleshow/113577268.cms,"SRINAGAR: For the first time since their ancestors migrated from Pakistan to J&K during the 1947 Partition, over 5,000 Hindu families will vote in the ongoing assembly elections .Forced to live in 39 squalid camps near Jammu for over seven decades because Article 370 on J&K’s special status denied them land and other rights, these refugees are looking forward to the Oct 1 polls as a watershed moment.The right to exercise their franchise follows Article 370’s abrogation in Aug 2019, a move which cleared the way for granting these refugees permanent resident status after decades of political marginalisation.To add to their political heft, two seats have been reserved for these immigrants in the assembly. The Centre will nominate the two members.“For us, voting day will be a festival,” said Labhu Ram, president of West Pakistan Refugee Action Committee, adding the families will celebrate the ballot with special dishes like puri-halwa and laddus to express excitement and gratitude for this long-awaited opportunity.The ancestors of the refugees, numbering around 5,700 and mostly from Scheduled Castes (SCs), have lived so far without many of the rights and privileges enjoyed by residents. “The abrogation brought about a seismic shift in our political status, finally allowing us full participation in the electoral process. Till now, we were living as second-class citizens. This basic democratic right was snatched away from us by those who today claim to safeguard democratic institutions,” said Des Raj, a camp resident, alluding possibly to J&K-based parties.Some of the refugees were forced to leave areas of Kashmir occupied by Pakistan in 1947, while others came from areas of Sialkot, bordering Jammu. They were provided land in Jammu in 1960s but Article 370 --- which barred outsiders from owning land in J&K -- meant no ownership rights. This prevented them from getting benefits of govt housing schemes or access to bank loans. These refugee families were treated as “non-state subjects” as they not were not residents of the then princely state of J&K during the 1947 Partition.Ahead of a Supreme Court-stipulated Sept 30 deadline for holding the assembly polls, J&K administration on Aug 2 this year granted the refugees proprietary rights to the “state land” on which their ancestors were settled by the then govt decades ago.The Hindu refugees ’ livelihood and survival problems date back to the 1974 Partition, based on the nation theory, which led to large-scale cross-border migration and mayhem. In those tumultuous days, many Hindu families fled villages in Pakistan’s Sialkot and came to neighbouring Jammu’s Kathua and RS Pura areas. While some stayed back in Jammu, many others left and settled in Punjab, Delhi and other states of India.The main reason for the influx into Jammu was connectivity: Sialkot was then linked to Jammu by rail and road. Such people also shared cultural and economic affinity with Dogras of Jammu. According to some historians, many of the refugees had relatives in border villages of Jammu, leading them to be welcomed in the initial years of the crisis.","For the first time since their ancestors migrated from Pakistan to J&K during the 1947 Partition, over 5,000 Hindu families will vote in the ongoing assembly elections.

CM Mann is still proceeding on the path earlier tread by CM Beant Singh. Dilawar acted as a human bomb and blew up CM Beant Singh.

'We seek fresh start': Marxist leader Dissanayake after winning Sri Lanka presidential polls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/marxist-leader-anura-kumara-dissanayaka-wins-sri-lankas-presidential-election-defeats-ranil-wickremesinghe/articleshow/113573694.cms,"Sri Lanka presidential election result



Marxist leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake has won Sri Lanka 's presidential election , defeating incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe . Following his victory, Dissanayake called for national unity and said, ""The unity of Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims, and all Sri Lankans is the bedrock of a new beginning."" He further stressed that the ""new renaissance we seek will rise from this shared strength and vision,"" expressing hope for ""a fresh start"" to realise the country's aspirations.Sri Lanka's election commission formally announced that Dissanayake, 55, secured 42.31% of the vote in Saturday's election, with opposition leader Sajith Premadasa finishing second and Wickremesinghe, the sitting president, placing a distant third.The commission confirmed the results on its official website, and Dissanayake is set to be sworn in as Sri Lanka’s new president on Monday.Polling was conducted at over 13,400 stations across 22 electoral districts, with around 75% of Sri Lanka’s 17 million eligible voters participating. Dissanayake's victory marks a significant shift for his Marxist party, which had previously struggled for political influence after leading two failed uprisings in the 1970s and 1980s that resulted in over 80,000 deaths.The newly elected president's party, poised to lead the nation, has pledged not to abolish the controversial $2.9 billion IMF bailout agreement but aims to renegotiate its terms, as public discontent over the bailout continues to grow. The election is widely seen as a referendum on this IMF deal.Dissanayake in a heartfelt X post said that, ""The dream we have nurtured for centuries is finally coming true. This achievement is not the result of any single person’s work, but the collective effort of hundreds of thousands of you. Your commitment has brought us this far, and for that, I am deeply grateful. This victory belongs to all of us.""""Our journey here has been paved by the sacrifices of so many who gave their sweat, tears, and even their lives for this cause. Their sacrifices are not forgotten. We hold the scepter of their hopes and struggles, knowing the responsibility it carries. The millions of eyes filled with hope and expectation push us forward, and together, we stand ready to rewrite Sri Lankan history,"" Dissanayake added.Despite a peaceful election, Sri Lanka imposed a night curfew on Saturday as a precaution due to simmering public dissatisfaction.Meanwhile, outgoing President Ranil Wickremesinghe congratulated Dissanayake, stating, ""With much love and respect for this beloved nation, I hand over its future to the new President.""",Marxist leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake has won Sri Lanka's presidential election.

US Presidential Elections: Final debate showdown: Will Trump let Vance take the spotlight?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/final-debate-showdown-will-trump-let-vance-take-the-spotlight/articleshow/113574574.cms,"After Vice President Kamala Harris publicly challenged Trump to a second debate, hosted by CNN, on 23 October, speculations are arising whether Donald Trump wants his running mate, JD Vance , to have the final debate of this election, or if he wants that opportunity for himself.Donald Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, and Kamala Harris’s vice presidential pick, Tim Walz , are set to debate on October 1, hosted by CBS.This will be the only vice presidential debate of the campaign season and is expected to showcase the contrasting views and approaches of Vance, a Republican senator from Ohio, and Walz, the Democratic governor of Minnesota, as reported by CNN.As VP debates are typically held between presidential debates, not as the final event, ending with the Vance-Walz debate would feel anticlimactic without a final debate between Trump and Harris.Harris campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon said in a statement that “Trump should have no problem agreeing” since “it is the same format and setup as the CNN debate he attended and said he won in June, when he praised CNN’s moderators, rules, and ratings.”Given Trump’s keen interest in TV ratings, there’s still hope for another debate before Election Day, which CNN argues would help voters make a final, informed decision.However, Trump’s campaign quickly rejected the offer. Citing his recent social media post, “THERE WILL BE NO THIRD DEBATE,” Trump argued that a late-October debate was unnecessary because early voting would already be underway. He claimed that October 23 was ""just too late.""Several networks are vying to host another presidential debate. CNN and NBC, in particular, have expressed interest.Some political analysts, like Larry Sabato, the director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, observed on X, believe that a late debate could still influence undecided voters.This year’s election cycle has already been unusual. An early general election debate between President Joe Biden and Trump, combined with Harris's delayed nomination, has made for a unique campaign season.The first two debates this year attracted tens of millions of viewers, and a final debate would benefit Americans still weighing their options ahead of Election Day.","Donald Trump's running mate, JD Vance, and Kamala Harris’s vice presidential pick, Tim Walz, are set to debate on October 1, hosted by CBS.

Regional victory brings Germany's Scholz brief respite from growing pressure within party,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/regional-victory-brings-germanys-scholz-brief-respite-from-growing-pressure-within-party/articleshow/113583143.cms,"More tensions in Berlin

BERLIN: German Chancellor Olaf Scholz 's Social Democrats (SPD) staved off the far-right in a regional election on Sunday, likely providing him only a brief reprieve from growing criticism of his leadership within his own party.The centre-left SPD staged a last minute comeback in the eastern state of Brandenburg, where they have ruled since reunification in 1990 and Scholz has his own constituency, to win the election on 30.9% of the vote.The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which had topped polls for the past two years in the state, won 29.2%, according to provisional official results by the State Electoral Commissioner.Still the AfD was up 5.7 percentage points since the last Brandenburg election five years ago, after it earlier this month became the first far-right party to win a state election in Germany since World War Two.The AfD party continues to gain momentum as it capitalizes on worries about a cost-of-living crisis in Europe's largest economy, irregular immigration and a possible escalation of the war in Ukraine due to German weapons deliveries to Kyiv.Moreover, three-quarters of those who voted for the SPD did not do so out of conviction but rather to fend off the AfD, according to the exit poll published by broadcaster ARD, in the election with a record turnout of 72.9%.Brandenburg's SPD premier Dietmar Woidke avoided campaigning with Scholz, Germany's least popular chancellor on record, and even criticized the federal coalition's policies and constant bickering.As such, the regional election results are unlikely to end the growing debate within the SPD over whether Scholz is the right person to lead the party into next year's federal election given what critics call his hesitant leadership and poor communication skills.Asked on Sunday if the SPD federal leadership was the right one, Woidke said this was not the right time to answer that question.""But we must also learn the lessons from this election,"" he said, noting the SPD needed to get closer to the people. ""Especially as the federal level is concerned, there is a lot of catching up to do in the coming months and years.""The SPD is polling just 15% at national level, down from 25.7% in the 2021 federal election. That is behind the AfD on around 20% and opposition conservatives on 32%.Last week, the mayor of Munich, Germany's third largest city, was the latest SPD party politician to suggest it should consider fielding the popular Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, 64, as its candidate for the 2025 elections.Party insiders say Scholz, 66, who already announced his intention to run for a second term, is unlikely to step aside and more senior officials remain loyal to him.The junior partners in Scholz's ideologically heterogeneous coalition suffered dismal performances in Sunday's election which could further stoke tensions in Berlin.The Greens fell below the 5% threshold to make it into the state parliament for the first time in two decades on 4.1%, while the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) scraped less than 1% of the vote.""Either the traffic light coalition shows that it can draw the necessary conclusions from these elections, or it will cease to exist,"" warned FDP Vice Wolfgang Kubicki. ""This is a matter of a few weeks. We won't wait until Christmas. We can't put the country through that.""Last week, FDP leader and finance minister Christian Lindner had called for an ""autumn of decisions"", giving a cryptic answer when asked if his party would break up the coalition.Still, analysts say the government is unlikely to fall apart given none of the three coalition parties would currently stand to gain from snap elections. Together they are currently polling at around 30% combined, less than the conservatives alone.",The centre-left SPD staged a last minute comeback in the eastern state of Brandenburg.

Trump has also embraced increasingly dystopian rhetoric in the event of a 2024 loss.Amid his latest campaign, Trump has ventured into various business endeavours, including Trump Media , NFTs, and Trump-branded sneakers, coins, and crypto. Meanwhile, Harris, 59, has framed the election as a critical moment for US democracy while focusing on issues directly impacting families, such as costs and housing.When asked if the four-year break helped him regroup and identify trustworthy allies, Trump responded, ""It would have been easier if I did it ... contiguous.""He added, ""But the benefit is more than anything else, it shows how bad they were.""

The White House has said he will meet with Democratic Vice President Harris separately from Biden, and Zelenskyy has said he expects to meet with Republican Trump on Thursday or Friday.Harris has indicated she would continue Biden's policies on Ukraine, while Trump has been hugely critical of Washington's massive aid packages for Kyiv.Zelenskyy said earlier this week that the plan envisages that ""war will not return to us again in an even bigger wave"" in years to come.He has said Kyiv plans to hold meetings throughout autumn and that the ""entire plan"" will be ready by ""early November.""The proposals, he told the media Friday, envisage ""quick and concrete steps by our strategic partners.""One of those steps, he said, is ""related to strengthening Ukraine's weapons capabilities"" while another demands a ""clear place for Ukraine in the world's security architecture"".Zelenskyy has also said he plans to invite Russia to a possible second international peace summit in November.But Moscow this weekend said it would not attend and referred to President Vladimir Putin's conditions to enter talks: that Ukraine surrender four of its regions.""I think both are still betting on the possibility of a military victory,"" UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres told CNN Sunday.Russian attacks on Ukraine killed six people -- including two children -- this weekend, while a strike on the city of Kharkiv wounded 21 people in a residential neighbourhood.Ukraine said it struck two arms depots in Russia, with Kyiv's army saying it hit a key ammunition storage base important to the Russian army's logistics for its invasion.",Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyyy arrives in the United States for a crucial visit.

She immediately approached Oakland police with the lead.Soon after, a missing persons case was reopened, and through DNA testing, Albino was confirmed to be alive. In June 2024, investigators informed Alequin and her mother that Albino had been found. “We didn’t start crying until after the investigators left,” Alequin recalled. “I grabbed my mom’s hands and said, ‘We found him.’ I was ecstatic.”Albino travelled to Oakland on June 24, where he reunited with his family. He also visited his brother Roger in Stanislaus County, California . ""They grabbed each other and had a really tight, long hug,"" said Alequin. The reunion was heartfelt, as they reminisced about their childhood, the day of the abduction, and their military service.","Luis Armando Albino, 6, was abducted from a park in Oakland, California, in 1951.

He’s not lived a normal life,” Whitmer said.“Unlike Kamala Harris , who has worked hourly jobs, who knows how important it is that women have health care and access to the medical care that they need.

However, militants never called each other but utilised features of PUBG to avoid being traced, he added.“The militants would play PUBG to practice and motivate their group members for battle against the state and would use the chat room for communication,” Dawn quoted Zahidullah as saying.The investigation ultimately revealed that the attackers had employed an improvised explosive device (IED) constructed from a power bank, rather than a hand grenade, as initially suspected.CCTV footage led to the identification of one suspect, which subsequently resulted in the arrest of additional suspects who disclosed their affiliation with a local militant group, Murad alias Rehmatullah, associated with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan .The arrested suspects admitted to maintaining communication with their group and family members in Afghanistan through PUBG chat rooms, frequently changing mobile phones and SIM cards to avoid detection.","Militants targeted a police station in Swat, Pakistan, on August 28, killing one officer.
