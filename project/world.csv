How did the children drown? You have done an investigation now. We are on August 2. Why were they not able to come out of the basement? the bench demanded to know. ""It doesn't get flooded immediately. Water takes at least 2-3 minutes to fill a basement, it can't happen in a minute.""Pulling up the force for not questioning MCD officials, the bench told senior advocate Sanjay Jain, representing Delhi Police, ""No disrespect, but we don't think your police are equipped to handle this case.""Why didn’t you go to the MCD office and seize the file? Will you wait till the file gets changed and evidence lost? Are you a police force or you will wait to file an RTI query for answers?

Which are the MCD officials you have interrogated? These are very glaring omissions in the police probe. Any common man would ask these questions,” it said.HC took a dim view of the police’s act of arresting an SUV driver and blaming him for the incident and caustically observed, “Mercifully, you have not challaned the rainwater for entering the basement. You would have said how dare the water enter the basement. You could have fined the water also, the way you arrested the SUV driver for driving his car there.”On being informed by the MCD commissioner, who was present in the court, that the stormwater drains in the area were dysfunctional, the bench asked why the officials did not inform the MCD chief about it and ordered immediate removal of encroachments and unauthorised constructions, including on stormwater and sewage drains, in Rajender Nagar.HC pointed out that police could arrest a passerby but hadn’t interrogated the municipal official who did not see that the stormwater drain was dysfunctional. “First of all, your police officers, we have called them here for one purpose... (to tell them) Police is respected when it books the culprit and leaves the innocent.It rapped the MCD for not adhering to judicial orders and said its officials were not bothered and there is no respect for the law.

NFU Nuclear Policy: China asks USA to adopt a NFU nuclear policy? What is a ‘no first use’ (NFU) policy?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/china-asks-usa-to-adopt-a-nfu-nuclear-policy-what-is-a-no-first-use-nfu-policy/articleshow/112221310.cms,"What is an NFU policy?

Which countries have nuclear weapons?



What is a nuclear deterrent ?



Wait, I heard about something called the Fourth Protocol? Is it real?

The Fourth Protocol

The Fourth Protocol

First Protocol: Likely refers to an agreement to prevent the unauthorized use of nuclear weapons, ensuring that they can only be deployed with proper authorization and through established military and governmental procedures. Second Protocol: This could be interpreted as an agreement to prevent the accidental launch or detonation of nuclear weapons, possibly involving safety measures and secure command-and-control systems. Third Protocol: This might relate to the prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons in warfare unless in retaliation to a nuclear attack, reflecting a ""No First Use"" policy or similar stance. Fourth Protocol: The central fictional construct of the novel, this protocol specifically forbids the clandestine transportation and detonation of a nuclear weapon in another country, especially with the intent to disguise the origins of the attack. The violation of this protocol is the key plot point of the novel, as the Soviet Union attempts to secretly place and detonate a nuclear bomb in the UK to manipulate political outcomes.

China's ""no first use"" (NFU) nuclear policy is a commitment that it will not be the first to use nuclear weapons in any conflict but would only use them in retaliation if attacked with nuclear weapons. This stance makes China unique among the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, as it is the only one that has made such a pledge.Recently, China has urged other nuclear powers, including the United States, to adopt a similar NFU policy.In a formal proposal submitted in Geneva, China argued that the NFU policy is becoming increasingly important for global arms control . However, officials from the U.S. and its allies view China's push as an attempt to deflect criticism from its own rapid nuclear build-up. This build-up includes expanding its arsenal, building new missile silos, and modernizing its delivery systems, which could elevate China to a nuclear power on par with the U.S. and Russia.A ""No First Use"" (NFU) policy is a commitment made by a country with nuclear weapons that it will not use them as a first strike in any conflict. This means that the country promises only to use nuclear weapons in retaliation if it is attacked first with nuclear weapons.In simpler terms, under an NFU policy, a country pledges not to start a nuclear war but reserves the right to respond with nuclear weapons if it is attacked with them. This policy is meant to reduce the chances of nuclear conflict by assuring other countries that the NFU country won't initiate a nuclear attack. However, it still maintains a deterrent by promising retaliation if nuclear weapons are used against it.Nine countries— the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea, and Israel—are known to have nuclear weapons.A nuclear deterrent is a strategy used by countries with nuclear weapons to prevent or discourage other countries from attacking them. The idea is that if a country has nuclear weapons and is willing to use them in retaliation, it deters or discourages potential enemies from launching an attack, particularly a nuclear one.The concept relies on the fear of mutually assured destruction (MAD), which means that if one country launches a nuclear attack, the other country will respond with its own nuclear weapons, leading to devastating consequences for both sides. Because of this threat, countries are less likely to initiate an attack, knowing it could lead to their own destruction.In essence, a nuclear deterrent is like a warning signal: ""If you attack us, we'll respond with nuclear force, and it will be catastrophic for both of us."" This threat is meant to keep peace by making the cost of war too high to consider.Aah, a Frederick Forsyth fan.is a 1984 thriller novel written by British author Frederick Forsyth. The story revolves around a covert operation by the Soviet Union to detonate a nuclear bomb in the United Kingdom in a way that would make it appear as if it was the result of an accident or mishandling by Western powers. The goal is to destabilize the UK and influence its political landscape.The title ""The Fourth Protocol"" refers to a fictional secret protocol, which is an agreement or understanding between nations to prevent the use of nuclear weapons in this covert manner. In the novel, breaking this protocol could lead to catastrophic consequences and international instability.In, Frederick Forsyth creates a fictional world where several ""protocols"" are understood to be secret agreements or understandings related to the handling of nuclear weapons. Although Forsyth doesn't detail each protocol explicitly, they are implied to be key agreements that nuclear powers have made to avoid certain types of nuclear conflict or misuse. Here's a general idea of what these fictional constructs are meant to represent:","A ""No First Use"" (NFU) policy is a commitment made by a country with nuclear weapons that it will not use them as a first strike in any conflict. This means that the country promises only to use nuclear weapons in retaliation if it is attacked first. China has urged other nuclear powers, including the United States, to adopt a similar NFU policy.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112224902,imgsize-307168,width-400,resizemode-4/112224902.jpg"
High alert across Jammu after Hizbul terrorist goes missing from home,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/high-alert-across-jammu-after-hizbul-terrorist-goes-missing-from-home/articleshow/112232675.cms,"Security personnel stand guard during an encounter with terrorists in Trimukha area of Sopore in North Kashmir. (PTI)

JAMMU: Authorities in Jammu issued a high security alert after a 21-year-old Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist — who was out on bail — disappeared from his residence in south Kashmir’s Kulgam district, officials said Friday. “He had carried out a grenade attack at Jammu bus stand in March 2019, killing two civilians and injuring 31 others,” said an official.Jammu Police distributed posters with the missing terrorist’s image in prominent locations across the region, urging the public to report any information regarding his whereabouts.The informer’s identity will be kept secret. The heightened alert aims to prevent any potential threats and ensure public safety.On March 7, 2019, a powerful explosion ripped through the crowded General Bus Stand in Jammu, in which Mohammad Riyaz (32) of Anantnag’s Mattan village and Mohammad Sharik, a teen from Uttarakhand, were killed.The Hizb terrorist was just 16 years old when he was arrested from Nagrota while he was trying to escape back to Kashmir. At the time of his arrest, his Aadhaar card and other IDs, including school records, showed his date of birth as March 12, 2003. During interrogation, he revealed that he had been tasked with carrying out the terror attack by proscribed outfit Hizbul Mujahideen and paid Rs 50,000 to execute the strike. Fayaz, a self-styled chief of the outfit’s Kulgam unit, had passed on a grenade to an overground worker, Muzammil, to throw at a crowded place anywhere in Jammu, he claimed. After Muzammil developed cold feet, he was instructed to deliver the grenade to the teen, whose code name was “Chotu”, he told investigators.The teen was later granted bail because of his juvenile status at the time of the attack. The J&K Juvenile Justice Board had even pulled up some national and local media houses for publishing his name in violation of the Juvenile Justice Act.His arrest and subsequent bail indicated terror outfits’ tactics of employing underage youth to throw grenades as they can escape stringent punishment owing to their young age.",Jammu Police distributed posters with the missing terrorist’s image in prominent locations across the region.

In response, the US has placed missile defence forces on heightened alert and reaffirmed its ""ironclad"" commitment to Israel's security.Ayatollah Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, has vowed ""harsh punishment"" against Israel for Haniyeh's killing and declared three days of national mourning.Haniyeh, 62, was killed in Tehran on Wednesday. Both Iran and Hamas blame Israel for the attack, although Israel has not commented on the matter.The Pentagon's statement highlighted that the new deployments are intended to ""improve US force protection, increase support for the defence of Israel, and ensure the US is prepared to respond to various contingencies"", according to Reuters. This will include additional ballistic missile defence-capable cruisers and destroyers.John Kirby, the strategic communications coordinator for the National security council, told CNN, “We’ve heard the Supreme Leader loud and clear that he intends to avenge this killing of a Hamas leader in Tehran, and that they want to conduct another attack on Israel. We can’t just assume that we are also potentially going to be victims of that kind of an attack, so we’ve got to make sure we’ve got the right resources and capabilities in the region.”In addition to some 80 land-based combat aircraft, the Pentagon has already deployed more than a dozen warships in the region.

The Harris campaign , which for the first 20 days of July was the Biden campaign, said it had raised $310 million during the month, including $200 million in just 7 days after Biden dropped out of the race.The Trump campaign and its own allies said Thursday that they had collected $139 million in July, an enormous sum but well short of Harris campaign's. The Harris campaign raised almost as much in July as the Biden campaign had raised in March, April, May and June combined. The surge in fund-raising has allowed Democrats, for the first time in months, to have a cash-on-hand advantage over Republicans. The Harris campaign said it now had $377 million in its war chest, in contrast to the $327 million that the Trump campaign has said it has.Neither campaign disclosed precisely how much of the money was raised or held by the campaigns themselves versus their allied party committees.Democrats' fund-raising was said to have plummeted in the first three weeks of the month, in the aftermath of Mr. Biden's disastrous debate, although precise figures were not known or released by the Biden campaign. But after Mr. Biden dropped out of the race on July 21, the fund-raising spigot was opened wide. The $200 million that the Harris campaign said it had raised in the week after Mr. Biden ended his re-election bid was more than Mr. Biden's haul in the first three months of the year.The Trump campaign's own fund-raising was strong - and most likely would have far outstripped the Democrats' had the party not changed its standard-bearer. The $139 million raised in July amounted to one of the Trump team's strongest fund-raising months to date, just off the sum raised in May, when Mr. Trump's supporters responded to his felony conviction with $141 million in donations.","The Harris campaign said it had raised $310 million during the month, including $200 million in just 7 days after Biden dropped out of the race.

But that hasn't stopped the former President from trying to pry away Black votes from Democrats with the latest tactic of questioning Kamala Harris ' black identity.Trump supporters are now bombarding social media with visuals purporting to show Kamala Harris' Indian heritage, which she has happily owned while embracing a primarily Black identity.Trump's MAGA flock though cannot seem to get their heads around the fact that people can be bi- or multi-racial.Hashtags such as #KamalaisIndian and #FakeBlack trended in the MAGAsphere, while Trump himself led the way on Thursday by posting a photo of Kamala dressed in a sari sitting with her maternal grandfather P.V.Gopalan and her grandmother Rajam, with a cheeky message that read: Thank you Kamala for the nice picture you sent from many years ago! Your warmth, friendship, and love of your Indian heritage are very much appreciated.”Also seen in the photo is Kamala's sister Maya Lakshmi Harris, who is married to Tony West, a former U.S. associate attorney general. Both Tony West, who is Black, and Maya Harris, who has been Kamala's campaign manager in the past, are part of her inner political circle.Since Trump himself said earlier this week that he has known Kamala only indirectly, it is unlikely she sent him the photo. But such claims are par for course considering current political playbook (on both sides) involves fudging, distorting, and conflating issues and data to score political points.So far, there are no indications that Trump has made any dent in the Democratic stranglehold on the Black vote after initial signs of weaning away some when Biden was the Democratic nominee. A CNN poll of 1,631 registered voters, conducted between July 22-23, found Kamala Harris has the support of 78 percent of Black voters, with Trump at 15 percent. A previous poll taken before Biden pulled out the race showed 23 percent ofBlack voters backing Trump.Those numbers seem generous considering Trump received only 8 percent of support from Black voters in 2020, according to Pew Research. One political commentator said the swift shift in support from Trump to Harris among Black voters ""tells you something about how fickle Trump's support was among these voters...Once they had a viable alternative that also happens to share their racial identity , they jumped ship from Trump almost instantly.""While Trump going below the 8 per cent black vote he got in 2020 is hard to imagine, even some of his supporters are aghast that he inadvertently tried it at the trainwreck of an interview earlier this week at a convention of black journalists. In one crash and burn moment during event, Trump said illegal immigrants are taking away ""black jobs,"" leading the host to ask “What’s exactly is a black job, sir?"" Trump: ""A black job is anybody that has a job! That's what it is.”On Friday, the multiple gold medal winning American gymnast Simone Biles appeared to take a swipe at Trump for the stumble, tweeting: ""I love my black job,"" with a photo of her winning a second gold medal at the Paris Olympic Games. Many Black Americans saw that as an insult.Black Americans are now projected to account for 14 per cent of eligible voters in the US, numbering 34.4 million voters, according to Pew Research Center projections. But not all eligible voters are actually registered to vote. In battleground states such as Georgia, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, they are expected to play a decisive role if Democrats can ensure a good turnout on Election Day.The MAGA Republican strategy centers on trying to suppress the black vote. According to New York University School of Law’s Brennan Center for Justice, lawmakers in 47 states have introduced more than 360 bills this year with provisions that restrict voting access. This includes steps such as curbing early voting and voting hours ( expansion of which will help blue-collar/shift workers, a predominantly Democratic constituency) and drive through voting (which helps special needs and differently-abled voters).",Trump supporters are bombarding social media with visuals purporting to show Kamala Harris' Indian heritage.

He said that the party's forthcoming power show in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Swabi was aimed at raising a ""strong voice"" for the release of the PTI founder and other detained leaders.""This country will only be governed in accordance with the law and the Constitution,"" Qaiser emphasised.During his address, Qaiser also rebuked the incumbent Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz-led coalition government over skyrocketing power bills.

Nepal PM Oli: Nepal's new PM Oli likely to visit Thailand on his first overseas trip,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/nepals-new-pm-oli-likely-to-visit-thailand-on-his-first-overseas-trip/articleshow/112221300.cms,"KATHMANDU: Nepal's newly-elected Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli is most likely to choose Thailand as the destination of his first foreign trip , breaking the tradition of visiting a neighbouring country first. In the past, Nepalese Prime Ministers mostly paid visits to India first, with some exceptions of choosing China as their first destination.Prime Minister Oli is scheduled to pay a visit to Thailand in the first week of September to attend the BIMSTEC (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation) Summit, according to official sources.An aide to Oli said that the Prime Minister will visit Thailand tentatively in the first week of September as his first foreign entourage to attend the BIMSTEC summit , though details of the visit are yet to be finalised.The leaders of member countries of BIMSTEC including Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand are meeting in Bangkok in the first week of September to attend the summit of the regional body.Prime Minister Oli will then visit the US in the third week of September to attend the United Nations General Assembly .""So far, we have not yet received any official invitation for a visit to India,"" said the aide to the Prime Minister.Oli, the chairman of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) was elected Prime Minister on July 14. He assumed office after the coalition government led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda' lost a vote of confidence in Parliament.Meanwhile, The Kathmandu Post newspaper said the previous government's decision to recall Nepal's ambassadors from India and China made Prime Minister Oli's visit to either of the neighbours almost impossible in August.The earlier government of CPN-UML and the Maoist Centre had recalled Shanker Sharma and Bishnu Pukar Shrestha from India and China, respectively, but following a change in the ruling coalition earlier this month, the government decided to reappoint Sharma to India.Similarly, Krishna Prasad Oli is set to replace Shrestha in Beijing. Shrestha and four other envoys have been asked to return to Kathmandu by the end of August, the paper said.","Nepal's newly-elected Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli is most likely to choose Thailand as the destination of his first foreign trip.
