NEW DELHI: Telugu Actor Allu Arjun termed the accusations over the Sandhya Theatre stampede during the premiere of his film ' Pushpa 2: the Rule ' part of a campaign of ""character assassination"" as Telangana chief minister Revanth Reddy on Saturday said the actor was denied permission for the visit by the police.The incident on December 4 led to the death of a woman, Revathi, and injuries to her son, Sri Tej.Allu Arjun in a press conference at his Jubilee Hills residence described the incident as ""very unfortunate"" and offered his condolences. “It is a very unfortunate incident. It is completely an accident. My condolences to the family. I am taking updates every hour about the condition of the child (hospitalised). His condition is improving, it is very good. There is a lot of misinformation, false allegations are being made. I don't want to blame any department or politician. My character is being assassinated,"" he said.The controversy escalated after AIMIM MLA Akbaruddin Owaisi criticised the actor in the Telangana Assembly, alleging ""irresponsible behaviour"" during the tragedy. Owaisi without taking any name accused Arjun of continuing to watch the film despite being informed about the stampede.

Speaking in the assembly, the CM said, “The police refused a request from AIMIM MLA Akbaruddin Owaisi to facilitate the cast and crew’s visit to Sandhya Theatre, citing safety concerns. Despite this, the hero came to watch the movie and got out of the car roof, doing a roadshow at RTC X road.""Reddy described the aftermath, stating, ""The police saw their predicament and shifted them to a hospital where Revathi was declared dead on arrival. The boy was in a critical condition. After the stampede, the ACP went to ask the hero to leave to gain control of the mob. At first, the actor refused, saying that he would leave after finishing the movie. Then the DCP had to intervene, asking the hero to leave or he would be arrested as two people had already fallen outside.""The CM emphasised that no special privileges would be extended to anyone. “Protecting the lives of people is the highest priority of my government,” he said.Allu Arjun was arrested following the incident but secured bail from the Telangana High Court on December 16 after furnishing a bond of Rs 50,000. He expressed his concern for the injured victim, stating that he had been advised not to visit Sri Tej due to ""ongoing legal proceedings"" but assured support for his medical needs.Meanwhile, Pushpa 2: The Rule, directed by Sukumar and starring Rashmika Mandanna and Fahadh Faasil, continues to break box office records despite the controversy.","Allu Arjun calls the accusations over the Sandhya Theatre stampede during the premiere of his film'Pushpa 2: the Rule'part of a campaign of ""character assassination"" Telangana chief minister Revanth Reddy on Saturday said the actor was denied permission for the visit by the police.

‘Inhuman’: CM A Revanth Reddy slams Allu Arjun,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/inhuman-cm-a-revanth-reddy-slams-allu-arjun/articleshow/116547909.cms,"HYDERABAD: Accusing actor Allu Arjun and the production team of being ""inhuman"" towards Revathi's family and her son Sri Tej, who is battling for his life in a hospital after the Sandhya theatre stampede , chief minister A Revanth Reddy Saturday questioned whether any special laws exist for film stars, superstars, and political figures that exempt them from prosecution.Launching a blistering attack on the actor in the assembly, the CM stressed that as long as he is in office, his primary responsibility is to protect the lives of people, and govt would not spare anyone involved, directly or indirectly, in the Sandhya theatre incident. The stampede claimed the life of Revathi, while her son Sri Tej remains in critical condition.Revanth also condemned the behaviour of film personalities who queued up at Allu Arjun's residence after he was released from jail, as if he had been injured in the incident, claiming to have fractured his legs, arms, or lost a kidney. In contrast, these same people did not visit Revathi's grieving family or offer support to the nine-year-old Sri Tej, who remains in a coma, the CM said.""Some people are criticizing the govt and me over the arrest of the film star in connection with the stampede. But, is there a special law in our Constitution for film and political stars that exempts them from prosecution, or allows them to avoid being booked for a crime - even if they are responsible for someone's death?"" the CM said.""As per Ambedkar's law, there are no separate laws for anyone - whether for Revanth Reddy's family or anyone else. All are equal, and those involved in the Sandhya incident will be dealt with according to the law,"" the CM stated.He also responded to criticisms regarding the delay in Allu Arjun's release after receiving bail, saying: ""There are rules for jail authorities, and they cannot release an accused person at midnight just because he is a film hero. This is not my house where I can act on whims. We follow the law, not personal preferences.""The CM advised the film fraternity to focus on producing films, running their businesses, earning incentives, and making money - but to do so with consideration for society.He pointed out that the state govt had approved benefit shows and allowed a raise in ticket prices for the first week of the film's release. He further highlighted the tragic reality faced by Revathi's family, with Revathi's husband earning only Rs 30,000 a month, yet spending Rs 12,000 on tickets to watch the film, as their son was an ardent fan of Allu Arjun.The CM also responded to claims that the film star's arrest was politically motivated, due to his association with a politician, who was a minister for 10 years. ""This govt will go by the law and the rules, regardless of any political connections,"" he asserted.Explaining the sequence of events on Dec 4, the CM said Sandhya theatre management had approached Chikkadpally police for permission to hold the premiere of Pushpa 2 with Allu Arjun and the film crew in attendance. However, police denied the request in writing, citing concerns over crowd control due to the presence of multiple theatres in the RTC crossroads area, the CM said.""Despite the police denial, Allu Arjun and the production team went ahead with the event, leading to thousands of fans gathering outside the theatre. The situation turned chaotic when bouncers pushed people aside to make way for Allu Arjun. In the chaos, Revathi and her son were among those who fell unconscious. Even at that moment, Revathi did not let go of her son's hand,"" Revanth said.The theatre management initially prevented the assistant commissioner of police from entering to inform Allu Arjun that he needed to leave due to the crowd. The ACP requested the actor to leave, but Allu Arjun insisted on staying to watch the entire film. Eventually, the deputy commissioner of police warned that Allu Arjun would be arrested if he did not leave the premises. The CM said even when cops went to the actor's house before his arrest, Allu Arjun displayed disrespect towards police.The CM outlined two violations committed by Allu Arjun and the production team: The first violation was the actor attending the event despite police denying permission, and the second was his participation in a rally, waving to the crowd from the sunroof of his car. ""These actions not only flouted the law but directly contributed to the tragic events that followed,"" he said.","Chief minister A Revanth Reddy questions whether any special laws exist for film stars, superstars, and political figures that exempt them from prosecution.

Sanjesh was on his way to Manesar after delivering four-wheelers at Mundra port of Gujarat when he became victim of the inferno.The family after seeing the condition of trailer is very sure that with the magnitude of massive fire they can't expect Sanjesh is alive, but they awaited official confirmation till 8pm.Accompanied by his brother Inderjeet and the manager from the Gurgaon transport company where Sanjesh worked as a driver, they located the burnt trailer. On the spot, local witnesses shared a video showing a severely burnt Sanjesh being transported by an ambulance. When they enquired at SMS Hospital, the staff informed them that no patient named Sanjesh was listed among the deceased. Amarjeet and his brother submitted DNA samples, expecting to identify their brother among the unidentified casualties.TOI reached the mortuary where Amarjeet and his brother Inderjeet were sobbing and waiting for the DNA sample report. They had no hopes of finding their brother injured as they believed he had died and now they wanted his mortal remains.""I got a call from the transport company at 7am on Friday stating an accident took place near Jaipur. The company manager asked us to reach Jaipur and he promised he too was coming. We went to the spot and could find the truck driven by Sanjesh. The truck was reduced to metal barebones,"" said Amarjeet while wiping off his tears.Inderjeet said, ""Some people at the spot showed us at least 20 videos, out of which in one video we could see that my brother was badly charred and was transported in an ambulance to the hospital. Only locals asked us to reach SMS Hospital to find him.""","Sanjesh Yadav (30), the driver of a trailer truck coming from Mundra Port and going to Manesar in Haryana is among those who were identified as deceased on Saturday following matching of DNA samples.

Rajasthan tanker explosion: Toll hits 13 as 2 more die during treatment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rajasthan-tanker-explosion-toll-hits-13-as-2-more-die-during-treatment/articleshow/116547273.cms,"JAIPUR: The death toll rose to 13 from Friday's devastating LPG tanker explosion following a collision with a truck on Jaipur-Ajmer national highway at Bhankrota, as two more people with severe burns died during treatment Saturday. Rajasthan police said Friday's toll has been revised to 11, down from the initially reported 12. The earlier count included five unidentified bodies, but it was later discovered that one found in pieces was counted twice. Of the four unidentified bodies, two were identified Saturday - former IAS officer Karni Singh and a trailer driver.The two men who died Saturday were both from Rajasthan - identified as 20-year-old Faizan from Udaipur and Govind Narayan, 32, a resident of Kekri district. They were among 26 patients admitted to govt-run Sawai Man Singh (SMS) hospital in Jaipur - nearly 15km from the accident site. Seven others are receiving care at private hospitals in the city.Three survivors, battling severe burns and respiratory damage caused by toxic fumes from the explosion, remain in critical condition at SMS. All three - 45-year-old Yosuf from Bhilwara (90% burns); Naresh, 28, from Madhya Pradesh (80%); and 23-year-old Vijeta from Banswara (70%) - are on ventilator support in ICU.Doctors highlighted the unusual severity of the injuries. ""Those who died suffered severe lung and respiratory tract injuries due to fumes (emitted during the LPG explosion),"" said Dr RK Jain, head of burn and plastic surgery at SMS hospital.""It is something different that we noticed in this case. If a person has 90% burn injuries and their lungs and respiratory tract are also damaged due to fumes, the survival of such patients becomes difficult. All those who died in the Bhankrota accident had deep burns in their lungs and respiratory tracts due to fumes.""The patients are also grappling with burn shock caused by hypovolemia, a loss of intravascular fluid. Doctors have been administering intravenous (IV) fluids and antibiotics to prevent infections and stabilise the patients.""To administer IV fluid, we could not find the peripheral line (nerve) in some patients, so we had to use a central line through the neck and groin. After 72 hours, we will examine them and adjust the treatment as needed,"" Dr Jain added.","Death toll rises to 13 from Friday's devastating LPG tanker explosion following a collision with a truck at Bhankrota.

He was among 12 crew members aboard the 47-foot rescue vessel that encountered the drones on the evening of the sighting.“We were actually out there to see if we could spot any drones, because of all these sightings,” the sailor explained. “Well, we found some drones. Or more accurately, they found us.”According to the sailor, the drones appeared suddenly around 9 pm and followed the vessel for about 15 minutes. The drone swarm mirrored the boat’s movements, shifting direction as the boat did. “They had four propellers, about seven feet across, with festive red, green, and white flashing lights,” he said. The drones flew at an estimated 80 to 100 feet above the vessel.The swarm kept pace with the Department of Homeland Security boat, which was travelling at around 20 knots (just over 20 miles per hour). The drones eventually ascended, climbing an additional 100 feet before veering left towards the shoreline and disappearing from sight.The sailor is adamant that these were no ordinary commercial drones. “Commercial airplanes don’t move like that. We know what drones look and sound like,” he said.However, White House spokesman John Kirby downplayed the Coast Guard’s account, suggesting the drones could have been a mix of commercial, hobbyist, and law enforcement drones, as well as aircraft and even stars mistakenly identified as drones. Kirby stated that the sightings presented no national security or public safety threat, and suggested that the Coast Guard might have confused incoming airliners with drones.The Coast Guardsman disagreed, saying, “I can’t pretend to know what’s going on, but those weren’t the types of drones you can buy at the store. These were government drones.”The sailor added, “I don’t care what Kirby or [DHS head Alejandro] Mayorkas say — they’re full of sh-t.” He stressed that while their orders were to observe and not engage with the drones, they would have taken defensive action if the drones had acted aggressively.Local officials, including Representatives Chris Smith and Jeff Van Drew, have criticised the federal response, demanding a clear explanation for the mysterious drone activity, the New York Post quoted.Since November 18, more than 1,000 drone sightings have been reported over New Jersey, with dozens more in New York’s airspace, raising growing concerns over the presence of drones in civilian airspace. Federal authorities, however, maintain that the sightings pose no security threat.","Coast guardsmen from Barnegat Light, New Jersey, are voicing frustration after federal officials dismissed their accounts of being followed by a fleet of drones while patrolling the Atlantic Ocean.

"Wisconsin Female Shooter: Wisconsin shooter Natalie Rupnow was a new student, joined less than 4 months ago",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/wisconsin-shooter-natalie-rupnow-was-a-new-student-joined-less-than-4-months-ago/articleshow/116544793.cms,"Natalie Rupnow was a new student at the school where she opened fire before shooting herself.



What are the newest revelations in the Wisconsin school shooting

Natalie Rupnow had two guns with her when she opened fire. She used a handgun to carry out the attack after which she shot herself. The other gun was not used in the attack. Natalie Rupnow's parents -- Jeff Rupnow and Melissa Rupnow -- may face criminal charges but the police did not comment on it. Investigators are looking at if the parents were negligent. Rupnow's parents have been married to each other and divorced from each other twice which resulted in a very chaotic custody battle with Natalie switching between her mother and father. Natalie was in therapy over her turbulent family life. Both her parents had other children from other partners. Natalie's gun attack lasted for just about eight minutes. Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said the motive appears to be a combination of factors. FBI detained Alexander Paffendorf, a 20-year-old man in California because he was in connection with Natalie Rupnow. Paffendorf admitted to discussing plans with Rupnow to arm himself with explosives and target a government building. A TikTok account believed to belong to Natalie Rupnow has been deleted after the shooting. The account posted a range of very generic white supremacist and antisemitic memes. ABC News reported that Rupnow also had an X account through which she shared footage of a 2015 stabbing at a school in Sweden and a video of a person killing themselves at a shooting range.

Natalie 'Samantha' Rupnow, the 15-year-old, who opened fire at the Abundant Life Christian School in Wisconsin killing a teacher and a student was new to the school and joined only four months ago indicating that she probably did not have any grudge against the school specifically. The alleged manifesto, however, spoke about her being picked on, bullied, and ignored in school which might also refer to other schools she attended.At this school, Rupnow was in her first semester. The school was working with her family on attendance, but teachers had no significant concerns, the school authorities said.","Natalie Rupnow had two guns with her when she opened fire.

JD Vance questions media narrative

Netizens react with fury

Elon Musk takes aim at legacy media

Criticism extends to other outlets

A car driven by a Saudi man deliberately plowed into a bustling Christmas market in Magdeburg, Germany, on Saturday, killing two people and injuring at least 60 others. The tragedy, described by authorities as a deliberate attack, shocked the nation. However, headlines by prominent publications, including the Associated Press (AP), have drawn severe backlash for their phrasing, which critics say downplays the driver’s responsibility.The AP’s headline, “A car has driven into a group of people at a Christmas market in Germany,” was widely condemned for implying that the car acted autonomously, leaving out any mention of the driver, who was later identified as a Saudi national. The backlash intensified after verified bystander footage showed the driver being arrested at the scene.On X (formerly Twitter), the AP headline was flagged by a community note that clarified the situation: “‘A car has driven’ implies the car drove itself, which is factually incorrect. A man from Saudi Arabia intentionally drove the car into the Christmas market as a terror attack.”US senator JD Vance joined the critics, posting on X, “Who was driving the car?” His comment fueled an ongoing debate about whether the media deliberately uses passive language to obscure facts in such cases.The AP and other outlets were inundated with criticism from netizens, who accused legacy media of bias and misrepresentation.One user wrote: “Seriously @AP? Are you kidding us with this headline? If it was a white person driving, you’d scream it out on every headline. But since it’s a Saudi, you’re ignoring the driver’s identity.”Another added: “So everyone is clear, this is what ‘a car has driven into a group of people’ looks like. Nothing close to the passive headline the AP wrote. Just another reason you don’t hate the legacy media enough!”Some went further, accusing the AP of downplaying religious and cultural implications. A poll circulating on X asked, “Is AP deliberately avoiding mentioning the driver to downplay global hostility toward Christians?”Elon Musk also joined the conversation, slamming not just the AP but other outlets for similar headlines. Musk posted: “You don’t hate the lying legacy media enough,” amplifying criticism against established news organizations.The backlash wasn’t limited to the AP. The Guardian also came under fire for its headline, which described the car as a ""dark BMW"" without mentioning the driver.

Nancy Mace escalates feud with Fox News host: 'Which bathroom do we think Trey Gowdy uses?',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nancy-mace-escalates-feud-with-fox-news-host-which-bathroom-do-we-think-trey-gowdy-uses/articleshow/116523542.cms,"Republican Congresswoman Nancy Mace and Fox News host Trey Gowdy

This week, a heated online exchange between Republican Congresswoman Nancy Mace and Fox News host Trey Gowdy sent shockwaves through the political sphere, culminating in a series of personal jabs and escalating tensions within the GOP.It all began when Gowdy took to X (formerly Twitter) to criticize Mace, saying, “Nancy Mace would not be in the House if it weren’t for Donald Trump, and she can’t vote the way that he asked her to today?” Mace wasted no time firing back, retorting, “I have a message for Trey Gowdy: You let Hillary Clinton off the hook for Benghazi. Sit your ass back down.”However, the spat didn’t end there. Mace further escalated the conflict by sharing an old photo of Gowdy from his congressional days, with the caption, “Which bathroom do we think Trey Gowdy uses?” The comment appeared to be a swipe not only at Gowdy but also at her opposition to transgender rights , a point of contention that has repeatedly surfaced in her politics.Mace’s comment seemed to echo her criticisms of incoming transgender Representative Sarah McBride , who made history as the first openly transgender state senator in the US McBride, a fierce advocate for transgender rights, has notably used Capitol Hill bathrooms that align with her gender identity, a topic that has sparked controversy among certain Republican lawmakers.The clash with Gowdy wasn’t the only fallout Mace faced this week. Wesley Donehue, a South Carolina-based political consultant, revealed that he had severed ties with Mace months ago, citing her behavior as the reason. “I fired Nancy Mace as a client because I’m a political consultant, not a babysitter or a sex therapist,” Donehue wrote. He went on to call Mace’s actions “egotistical” and described her remarks as a “childish attack.”Adding fuel to the fire, Mace’s former communications director, Natalie Johnson, posted an old video of Mace enthusiastically praising Gowdy on Fox News. At the time, Mace referred to herself as a “huge fangirl” of Gowdy. Johnson’s comment, “It’s tough being a sycophant,” suggested a deepening fracture within Mace’s political network.This personal drama comes at a particularly challenging moment for the GOP. The Republican Party is currently embroiled in internal strife as they struggle to agree on a government funding bill . Just recently, a Republican-backed spending plan, supported by Donald Trump and Elon Musk, was shot down in the House by a 174-235 vote. The bill, which sought to raise the debt ceiling through 2027, was opposed by every Democrat in the chamber and 38 House Republicans, further exposing the ongoing divisions within the GOP.","Republican Congresswoman Nancy Mace and Fox News host Trey Gowdy got into a heated online exchange this week.

The purpose behind the construction of Stonehenge, a monument dating back roughly 5,000 years, has long puzzled historians and archaeologists. However, a new study may have shed light on its origins, suggesting it served as a symbol of unity among the peoples of ancient Britain , according to the news outletResearchers from University College London and Aberystwyth University claim that Stonehenge was created to represent the unification of communities from different regions of Britain. They claim that people from Scotland and Wales contributed local stones to the construction as a gesture of goodwill.The study, published in, highlights Stonehenge as an early example of a political and symbolic effort to unify diverse communities. The researchers describe the monument as a ""monumental expression of unity between people, land, ancestors, and the heavens.""In the paper, the researchers argue that Stonehenge’s long-distance links support the theory that the Neolithic monument had a unifying purpose in ancient Britain, alongside its symbolic value.""The fact that all of its stones originated from distant regions, making it unique among over 900 stone circles in Britain, suggests that the stone circle may have had a political as well as a religious purpose,"" said lead author Professor Mike Parker Pearson from UCL's Institute of Archaeology.""[It was] a monument of unification for the peoples of Britain, celebrating their eternal links with their ancestors and the cosmos.""The study posits that the Scottish and Welsh contributions symbolized alliances and shared efforts, embodying a sacred or political unity . Additionally, similarities in architectural styles between northern Scotland and the Stonehenge region suggest strong connections between these areas.""[This was] perhaps to cement an alliance or to take part in the extraordinary long-distance collaboration that building Stonehenge represented and embodied,"" the authors added.Evidence shows that many of the individuals buried at Stonehenge lived outside Salisbury Plain, indicating it was a site that drew people from across Britain.The study aligns with earlier research suggesting Stonehenge was used for rituals and ceremonies tied to the solstices. During the winter solstice, the setting sun aligns with the Altar Stone, further emphasizing its celestial significance.Theories about Stonehenge's purpose have ranged from its use as a solar calendar to a center for healing, ancestor worship, or burial rites.

Budget crisis speculation

Earlier conversations with

Harris' recent public appearance

Joe Biden and Kamala Harris abruptly canceled their holiday plans on Friday, fueling speculation about an ongoing emergency at the White House , as per various reports. Neither has issued a public statement , leaving the nation guessing about the sudden changes.Biden, who was expected to spend Christmas in Delaware, reportedly returned to Washington, DC, taking his motorcade directly from the airport to the White House late in the evening. Similarly, Harris canceled her planned flight to California and stayed in the capital.Harris had planned to be in LA until Monday, but her office provided no reason for the last-minute cancellation, leaving many to wonder if the political turmoil over the government’s funding was the cause. As the deadline for a potential government shutdown looms on Friday, Harris' absence from the West Coast has fueled further uncertainty about the Biden administration’s strategy in handling the budget impasse.The abrupt schedule changes have sparked widespread speculation on social media. One user noted discrepancies in the president’s official schedule, saying, “The official schedule for Biden does say he was to return to the White House at 5:30 pm, but as you can see, it has recently been updated.”Another user posted, “Kamala Harris canceled her trip, rushing back to the White House…WHAT IS HAPPENING?” The lack of clarity has left many questioning whether the cancellations are tied toHurricane Helene briefings or another undisclosed matter.Meanwhile, some social media users circulated images of an alleged White House press release stating that the ""Vice President will not travel to Los Angeles, CA, and will remain in Washington, DC.""Republicans are embroiled in an internal battle over a budget deal brokered between Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson and Democrats, aimed at averting a government shutdown. Critics have slammed the bill for being rushed through Congress, arguing that members were not given enough time to fully review the proposal.Meanwhile, the deal was further complicated when Republicans, led by President-elect Donald Trump and entrepreneur Elon Musk, introduced an alternate funding bill. That plan was swiftly rejected in the House, with many Republicans voting against it, creating a partisan standoff.Democrats, particularly those close to Harris, expressed frustration that the bipartisan agreement, which was seen as a potential compromise, was derailed after Musk publicly campaigned against it on X, the social media platform he owns. The showdown has added to the tension on Capitol Hill, as lawmakers race to find a resolution before the shutdown deadline.While Harris has not publicly commented on the situation, insiders close to her suggest that she is carefully weighing her political future, reported the Blaze. Following the aftermath of a challenging election, Harris has reportedly told allies that she intends to remain an influential figure in American politics.Some speculate that she may consider a campaign for governor of California, though others believe she will take on a more prominent role opposing the incoming Trump administration, reported the Blaze.“She is not someone who makes rash decisions,” said former Harris aide Brian Brokaw. “She takes, sometimes, a painfully long time to make decisions. So I would pretty much guarantee you she has no idea what her next move is.”With the deadline for a government shutdown fast approaching, all eyes will be on Harris and her next steps as the political drama continues to unfold in Washington.Before his return, Biden had a conversation with Pope Francis to discuss efforts to promote peace during the holiday season. According to a White House readout, the president thanked the pope for his advocacy on global issues and accepted an invitation to visit the Vatican next month.Harris’ last public event was on Tuesday, where she addressed high school and college students in Largo, Maryland. During her speech, she urged supporters to remain committed to their values despite the challenges ahead. “Yes, there is disappointment, but there is also resolve for the future. We must stay in the fight,” Harris said, referencing the aftermath of her election loss to Donald Trump.","Biden reportedly returned to Washington, DC, taking his motorcade directly from the airport to the White House late in the evening.

The driver of the car that plowed into a Christmas market crowd in Magdeburg , Germany, on Friday, killing at least two people, including a child, has been identified as Taleb. The city government reported at least 68 injuries, with 15 people in critical condition. The driver was arrested immediately.Taleb A., a 50-year-old Saudi Arabian medical doctor, is a consultant in psychiatry and psychotherapy, according to a report by The Guardian. Taleb had been living in Germany since 2006 and was granted refugee status in 2016.Footage from the scene showed the suspect lying on the ground near a heavily damaged black car, with a police officer pointing a weapon at him while bystanders looked on in shock.Saxony-Anhalt's leader, Reiner Haseloff, who was en route to Magdeburg, stated, “As things stand, he is a lone perpetrator, so as far as we know, there is no further danger to the city.”The Guardian report, citing a security source, revealed that the suspect had rented the car shortly before the attack and had no known Islamist ties.A witness told the Mitteldeutsche Zeitung that the attacker had “driven deliberately into the section of the Christmas market decked out with scenes from fairytales,” an area crowded with families and children. She described narrowly escaping with her child by throwing themselves out of the vehicle's path.A car crashed into a Christmas market crowd in Magdeburg, Germany, on Friday, killing at least two people, including a child. The city government reported 68 injuries, with 15 people in critical condition. Local officials are describing the incident as a terror attack. Eyewitnesses told broadcasters that a black BMW drove into the crowd toward the town hall, traveling at high speed for 400 meters.Videos circulating on social media, yet to be officially verified, appear to show a dark car speeding into the crowd.Emergency personnel treated the injured at the scene. Witnesses described hearing cries and screams, with one food stall operator comparing the aftermath to a ""war zone.""Saxony-Anhalt's leader, Reiner Haseloff, traveling to Magdeburg, stated, “This is a terrible event, particularly now in the days before Christmas.”One eyewitness, 32-year-old Nadine, told Bild newspaper that she was holding her boyfriend when the black car struck. ""He was hit and pulled away from my side. It was terrible,"" she said, as quoted by the BBC. Her boyfriend reportedly suffered leg and head injuries.The vehicle continued driving for hundreds of meters after the initial impact, according to video footage circulating in German media.MDR reporter Lars Frohmüller, who arrived at the scene shortly after the attack, described a chaotic situation. ""Everywhere there were ambulances, police, and many firefighters,"" Frohmüller told the BBC. ""This was a real chaotic situation. We saw blood on the floor, people sitting beside each other with golden and silver foils around them, and many doctors trying to keep people warm and help with their injuries. It's a big shock for everyone here in Magdeburg and across Saxony-Anhalt.""Germany has faced attacks on Christmas markets before. In 2016, an Islamist extremist drove a lorry into a Berlin market, killing 12 people.Last month, German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser emphasized the need for ""greater vigilance"" at Christmas markets. Despite this, she stated that there were no ""concrete"" indications of danger at the time. Following a knife attack in Solingen in August that killed three people, Faeser also highlighted the need for stricter weapons laws in public areas.In connection with the Solingen attack, a 26-year-old Syrian man was arrested on suspicion of being a member of the Islamic State group. This incident reignited discussions surrounding asylum and migration policies in Germany.","Taleb A., a 50-year-old Saudi Arabian medical doctor, is a consultant in psychiatry and psychotherapy.

Videos of the Ukrainian drone attack on the Russian city of Kazan, showing strikes on several residential high-rise buildings, went viral on social media and Telegram channels on Saturday.Russian state media confirmed the attack, reporting eight drone impacts, with six hitting residential buildings in Kazan, located about 800 kilometers east of Moscow.Local officials reported no injuries or fatalities from the incident, which prompted emergency services to respond and evacuate residents.Russia's aviation watchdog, Rosaviatsia, announced via Telegram that Kazan airport had temporarily suspended all flight arrivals and departures.The Kazan airport in Russia temperarirly suspended all incoming and outgoing flights on Saturday, as announced by Rosaviatsia, the Russian aviation authority, through Telegram, following a Ukrainian unmanned aerial vehicle strike on the city.The Baza Telegram channel, known for its connections to Russian security organisations has also shared an unconfirmed video content depicting an aerial device striking a tall building, resulting in a significant explosion.Rosaviatsia additionally implemented temporary flight limitations at Izhevsk airport, located in a smaller urban centre northeast of Kazan.Earlier on Friday Russia and Ukraine traded accusations over deadly missile strikes. Moscow reported that a missile attack on its Kursk border region killed five people, while an earlier strike on Kyiv left one man dead.According to news agency Reuters, Governor Alexander Khinshtein said that Ukraine targeted Rylsk, a small town in Russia's Kursk region, resulting in five deaths and twelve injuries.Khinshtein stated that Kyiv employed US-provided HIMARS rocket systems to strike civilian facilities, including a school and a pilot training college dormitory.Last year, Russia accused Ukraine of using cluster munitions to attack a town of approximately 15,000 residents located about 20 miles (30 km) from the border.Ukrainian military officials reported successfully intercepting and destroying 57 Russian drones during a nighttime assault. Additionally, they confirmed that 56 other Russian drones failed to strike their intended destinations.Ukraine's air force also reported that Russia launched five Iskander missiles at Kyiv, all of which were successfully intercepted.

"Days after earthquake claims 12 lives, Vanuatu struck by another tremor",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/days-after-earthquake-claims-12-lives-vanuatu-struck-by-another-tremor/articleshow/116555217.cms,"A magnitude-6.1 earthquake rattled buildings on Vanuatu's main island early Sunday but did not appear to have caused major damage, five days after a more powerful quake wreaked havoc and killed 12 people. ""It gave a better bit of a shake and the windows rattled a little bit, it would have caused houses to rattle,"" he said.

Five days after a deadly earthquake claimed 12 lives in Vanuatu, another powerful temblor struck the south pacific nation early on Sunday. The magnitude-6.1 earthquake rattled buildings on Vanuatu's main island, but did not cause major damage.This new quake reportedly occurred at a depth of 40 kilometers (25 miles), roughly 30 kilometers west of the capital, Port Vila, which has already been shaken by multiple aftershocks following Tuesday’s 7.3-magnitude quake.""It gave a better bit of a shake and the windows rattled a little bit, it would have caused houses to rattle,"" a witness was quoted as telling news agency AFP.""But you know, no movement other than a few inches either way, really. Whereas the main quake, you would have had like a metre and a half movement of the property very, very rapidly and suddenly.""I'd describe this one as one of the bigger aftershocks, and we've had a fair few of them now.""The first earthquake caused extensive destruction, toppling buildings and triggering landslides around Port Vila. While the latest tremor was significant enough to shake windows and rattle homes, it was considered one of the larger aftershocks. Despite its intensity, no tsunami alerts were issued, and no further damage was reported in the capital, though communication with affected areas remains difficult due to ongoing mobile network failures.The death toll from the Tuesday earthquake remains at 12, with 210 injuries and nearly 1,700 people displaced. The country has been grappling with disrupted infrastructure, including damage to water supplies and the capital’s main shipping port. In response, the government declared a seven-day state of emergency, enforced a night curfew, and lifted the suspension on commercial flights to revive the tourism sector.International aid is underway, with Australia and New Zealand sending over 100 rescue personnel, including trained dogs, to assist in searching for survivors and carrying out emergency repairs. Many areas, including several major collapse sites outside the capital, continue to be combed for trapped victims.The earthquake has severely impacted the pacific nation’s infrastructure, and while power has been restored in some areas, many are still waiting for essential services to return.

Rebel forces breached the capital, Damascus, on December 8, forcing Assad and his allies to flee.Assad sought refuge in Russia, traveling via the Russian military airfield in Hmeimim with only a handful of confidants that included Mansour Azzam, his secretary-general of presidential affairs, and Yassar Ibrahim, his economic adviser, according to news agency AFP.""He left with his secretary and his treasurer,"" an insider was quoted as telling .His escape, reportedly was hastily planned, leaving even close family members uninformed.Maher al-Assad , Bashar’s brother and commander of the elite Fourth Division tasked with defending Damascus, was reportedly unaware of his sibling’s plans. He fled separately, traveling by helicopter to Iraq before heading to Russia. Maher’s wife and son passed briefly through Lebanon before leaving for an undisclosed destination.Both Maher al-Assad and Bashar are wanted by France for their alleged involvement in war crimes, including the use of chemical weapons in 2013. Ali Mamlouk and Jamil Hassan, former head of Syria’s Air Force Intelligence, have already been sentenced in absentia by French courts to life imprisonment for complicity in crimes against humanity.Interpol has issued alerts for Jamil Hassan at the request of the United States, which accuses him of war crimes, including barrel bomb attacks that killed thousands of civilians. Lebanese authorities have vowed to detain him if he enters the country. The United States accuses Hassan of ""war crimes"", for the attack that killed many Syrians.Other prominent figures, including Ali Mamlouk, former chief of Syria’s security apparatus, also fled via Iraq to Russia. Meanwhile, Bouthaina Shaaban, Bashar’s longtime political adviser and translator, escaped to Abu Dhabi through Lebanon.Kifah Mujahid, head of the Baath Brigades -- the military wing of Syria's former ruling party -- escaped to Lebanon by boat, a party source was quoted as telling news agency AFP. Other officials took refuge in their hometowns in Alawite regions. Assad hailed from Syria's Alawite minority.However, not all attempts to flee succeeded. Ihab Makhlouf, a cousin of Bashar and a prominent businessman, was killed on December 7 while attempting to escape Damascus. His twin brother, Iyad, was injured in the same incident.Several individuals closely associated with Assad's government crossed into Lebanon. Among them were Ghassan Belal, the head of Maher's office, along with businessmen Mohammed Hamsho, Khalid Qaddur, Samer Debs, and Samir Hassan.Some high-ranking Syrian military officers were reportedly granted safe passage to the Hmeimim airbase by Russian forces after surrendering their troops to avoid further bloodshed.Meanwhile, the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the insurgent group that led the charge against Assad, has pledged to hold former regime figures accountable for their crimes.( With agency inputs)","Assad sought refuge in Russia, traveling via the Russian military airfield in Hmeimim.

Condemnation and reactions from global leaders

A chilling and deadly attack on a Christmas market in Magdeburg, Germany, has been linked to a 50-year-old Saudi doctor identified as Taleb al-Abdulmohsen. Authorities are investigating the incident as a suspected terror attack, with reports revealing a dark history of anti-Islam activism and right-wing extremist views behind the driver’s motive.Taleb A, a refugee from Saudi Arabia, was granted asylum in Germany in 2016, after fleeing his home country years earlier. He sought refuge from what he perceived as an oppressive Islamic government, reported Daily Mail.Upon settling in Bernburg, Germany, Taleb A worked as a psychiatrist and psychotherapist, living a relatively quiet life until his views began to take a more disturbing turn.According to The Guardian, Taleb became a prominent figure within the Saudi expatriate community in Germany, using his platform to express vehement opposition to Islam and advocate for women’s rights. His personal website and social media channels were heavily focused on critiquing what he believed was the dangerous tolerance of radical Islam by the German government.Previous media reports suggest he had worked to help ex-Muslims, particularly women, to flee Saudi Arabia after turning their backs on the religion.In one particularly inflammatory post, he warned potential refugees against coming to Germany, claiming that the country was too lenient toward Islam. Taleb A’s radical views extended to pro-Israel sentiments, which he posted following the deadly October 7th terror attack.Analysis of his social media reveals tweets in support of Germany's anti-immigration party AfD, while he has also made comments supporting Elon Musk, far-right activist Tommy Robinson, and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.Reports from the New York Post indicate that his online activity intensified days before the attack, with social media posts railing against the German government for promoting what he called the ""Islamization"" of Europe. He also claimed that authorities were suppressing his free speech due to his controversial opinions.The account's bio reads: 'Saudi Military Opposition. Germany chases female Saudi asylum seekers, inside and outside Germany, to destroy their lives. Germany wants to islamize Europe.'Posts include retweets of graphic videos, including one of a young Muslim woman purportedly being stoned to death 'because she had an affair with a young man outside of marriage.'Another was a retweet of a post that simply read: ""Can you find one positive thing about Islam?""In videos posted hours before the attack, he claimed that German authorities were opening his mail and stealing items including a USB stick.""I consider the Germans, as citizens, responsible for the persecution I am facing,"" he said in one video.""Currently in this country, the nation that is actively criminally chasing Islam critics is the German nation"", he said in another.He also appears to be a fan of AfD. In June, he retweeted party leader Alice Weidel, writing with typos: ""The left are crazy. We need the AfD to protect the police from them.""He also retweeted the right-wing extremist AfD activist Naomi Seibt with the following quote: ""Tyranny is based on the docility of cowards. I choose to be brave.""Reports from Saudi and UAE sources have further complicated the narrative, suggesting that Taleb A was a fugitive from Saudi Arabia, accused of treason. German officials had reportedly rejected extradition requests from Riyadh, citing human rights concerns.This refusal to extradite him has led to public outcry, with critics claiming that the act of granting asylum in exchange for future violence represents a devastating failure in European immigration policy.At least two people, including a young child, were killed and dozens more injured when Taleb A drove his black BMW at high speed through a Christmas market in Magdeburg, striking innocent bystanders in a harrowing rampage.The car was driven at least 400 meters (1,300 feet) through the Christmas market, as reported by Bild. Emergency services, including around 100 firefighters and 50 rescue personnel, were immediately dispatched to the scene.Shocked eyewitnesses described the scene as turning into ""war-like conditions,"" with people fleeing in all directions to avoid being struck by the vehicle. Videos from eyewitnesses showed the car speeding through the crowded market, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake.As police raced to the scene, Taleb A was quickly apprehended, his arrest captured in distressing footage circulating online. A police officer is seen aiming a drawn weapon at the suspect, who lay motionless on the ground, near the wrecked vehicle. Shocked bystanders watched as authorities took him into custody.German authorities have said that they suspect the attack was a deliberate act. Authorities in Magdeburg, including spokespersons Matthias Schuppe and Michael Reif, indicated that they are working on piecing together the details of the event.The local police also confirmed that an explosive device was found in the vehicle, reported Daily Mail. Regional security measures have been tightened, and hospitals in nearby cities, including Halle, have been prepared for potential additional casualties.The attack, occurring just one day after the anniversary of the 2016 Berlin Christmas market attack — which claimed 12 lives — has sparked renewed fears of terrorist acts in Germany. The suspect’s background as an outspoken critic of Islam and his affiliation with right-wing causes have raised concerns over the possible political motives behind the attack.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz expressed his concern in a post to social media, saying: ""The reports from Magdeburg suggest something bad. My thoughts are with the victims and their families."" Germany's Interior Minister also condemned the attack, offering thoughts for the victims while vowing that authorities would continue to investigate the background of the attack.Saudi Arabia, where the attacker was from, condemned the incident and expressed solidarity with Germany. The UK's Foreign Office has also expressed its concern, offering condolences to the victims and stating that they are closely monitoring the situation.","Taleb A, a refugee from Saudi Arabia, was granted asylum in Germany in 2016, after fleeing his home country years earlier. He became a prominent figure within the Saudi expatriate community in Germany, using his platform to express vehement opposition to Islam. His personal website and social media channels were heavily focused on critiquing what he believed was the dangerous tolerance of radical Islam by the German government.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116531414,imgsize-77496,width-400,resizemode-4/116531414.jpg"

"Luigi Mangione: After Luigi Mangione spectacle, Eric Adams' rival says he'd ban perp walk",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/after-luigi-mangione-spectacle-eric-adams-rival-says-hed-ban-perp-walk/articleshow/116547811.cms,"Luigi Mangione's perp walk raised several questions and also mayor Eric Adams' interest in creating the spectacle.

As New York mayor Eric Adams faces flak for ""orchestrating"" the pero walk of Luigi Mangione , his rival Jim Walden said if he's elected he would ban the practise in NYC as it serves no purpose. The mayor's office shut down the criticism and said people can tweet whatever they want but the mayor was present there showing support to the law enforcement.New York Democrat Ritchie Torres said the criminal justice system is not treating Luigi Mangione, the 26-year-old accused killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, like other assassins. Case in point: the perp walk of Mangione after he reached New York. ""The dramatic perp walk of Luigi Mangione, accompanied by a heavily armed police presence, strikes me as law enforcement theater. Why the need for so much spectacle at so much taxpayer expense?"" the Democratic leader said.""The criminal justice system should treat Luigi Mangione as it would any assassin. Elevating Mangione to a mythical status only serves to deepen his delusions of grandeur,"" he added.Torres said what many social media users spoke about with shock as a huge number of police personnel were deployed when New York City received Luigi Mangione from Pennsylvania. Mayor Eric Adams was also present. Perp walk is to make an example out of a person who is led to the police station or a courthouse in full public display.But Luigi Mangione's perp walk drew shock as social media users questioned the need for it. Some observers pointed out that it was absolutely counter-productive as instead of making an example out of Luigi Mangione, they made him a hero as they paraded Luigi Mangione who was seen in a new shaven look.Eric Adams walked behind wearing a navy blue overcoat while it is not usual for mayors to oversee the handling of people in federal custody. Did Eric Adams stage the perop walk? Adams said in a television interview that aired on Friday that the shooting had traumatized people who work in the health care field and he wanted to show that he was “leading from the front.”“I wanted to look him in the eye and say you carried out this terroristic act in my city — the city that the people of New York love, and I wanted to be there to show the symbolism of that,” Adams said in a television interview with WPIX news.New York Times observed that the high-profile perp walk also provided an opportunity for Mr. Adams, a former police captain, to project an image of toughness on public safety and to change the subject after a difficult week for the politically weakened mayor.Some legal experts and elected officials said the choreographed scene and the mayor’s appearance at the perp walk was a blatant and unnecessary attempt at self-promotion.Jim Walden, a former prosecutor who is running for mayor against Adams, said that perp walks encourage police officers and mayors “to peacock” and he would ban the practice as mayor. “It undermines due process,” he said on social media. “It serves no purpose except tainting potential jurors.”Kayla Mamelak, a spokeswoman for the mayor, said in a statement on Friday that Mangione had “infused terror on the streets of New York City for days” and that his “coldblooded assassination” had been “sickeningly glorified, shining a spotlight on the darkest corners of the internet.”“Critics can tweet all they want, but showing up to support our law enforcement as they extradited a brutal killer and sending the message to New Yorkers that violence and vitriol have no place in our city is who Mayor Eric Adams is to his core,” she said.","New York Democrat Ritchie Torres said the criminal justice system is not treating Luigi Mangione, the 26-year-old accused killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, like other assassins.

Biden and Jill will remain in the public sphere

First Lady Jill Biden has been encouraging outgoing president Joe Biden to push the buttons on his way out of the White House, Daily Mail reported adding that Nancy Pelosi will also have to bear some wrath as she was the main force behind Biden opting out of the presidential race and endorsing Kamala Harris ""Jill views Democrats on Capitol Hill, the [wider] party, the Obamas, staff inside and outside the White House, the media, and all of Washington DC with such misguided resentment that I can't imagine she [isn't] encouraging [Joe] to burn the whole thing down, despite his better judgment."" Daily Mail quoted a source.Democratic mega-donor John Morgan said he believes that Biden forced Kamala Harris to run against Trump to spite Pelosi and Barack Obama as they were not sure whether the Vice President could win the race. ""[Biden] basically had the palace coup from all directions, from George Clooney to Pelosi. I think he got pissed off [and] said, 'F*** you', and gave us Harris. Pelosi had told her delegation that there would be a convention and a nominating process. And Barack Obama did not endorse [Harris] for five days,"" Morgan said.And one of the ways to rile up the Democrats was to pardon Hunter Biden, the report said -- especially when Joe Biden and the White House reiterated that Hunter Biden would not be pardoned. The pardon came as Biden also commuted 1,500 sentences including for the relative of a member of a Chinese Communist Party who had been caught with child porn on his computer.Biden is preparing for his future outside the White House and one of the expected paths is establishing his presidential library in Delaware. Jill Biden will be retiring as she announced that she has taught her last semester at Northern Virginia Community College.","First Lady Jill Biden has been encouraging outgoing president Joe Biden to push the buttons on his way out of the White House, Daily Mail reported.

Who is Yaoning ""Mike"" Sun?



Yaoning Sun is a Chinese national residing in Chino Hills , California, and has been charged with acting as an unregistered foreign agent.

, which is registered under the ownership of the unnamed councilperson in California. The outlet appears to have been used as a vehicle to support pro-China narratives and to bolster the political status of elected officials in the United States and China.



Sun served as the campaign manager for an unnamed city council candidate who was elected to office in Southern California in 2022.



Records suggest Sun had close ties to the politician, funding some of their travel expenses and collaborating on political strategy. His role extended beyond campaign management, allegedly working to elevate the councilperson’s status with Chinese officials and facilitate their interactions with Beijing’s diplomats.



Prosecutors allege that Sun conspired with Chen Jun to interfere in US elections. Sun is accused of writing a report for Chinese officials recounting his role in the councilperson's election, describing them as a ""new political star"" and seeking additional funding for pro-Beijing activities in the US.



He also allegedly worked to set up meetings between the councilperson and high-ranking Chinese diplomats in Los Angeles.



US Attorney Martin Estrada noted that Sun appeared to be ideologically committed to furthering the Chinese government’s goals in America. Sun previously served in the Chinese military, which underscores his longstanding ties to China.



noted that Sun appeared to be ideologically committed to furthering the Chinese government’s goals in America. Sun previously served in the Chinese military, which underscores his longstanding ties to China. Sun faces charges of acting as an illegal agent of a foreign government and conspiracy to commit an offence against the United States. If convicted, he could face up to 15 years in federal prison.

The arrest of Yaoning ""Mike"" Sun, a 64-year-old Chinese national, has intensified concerns about Beijing’s alleged interference in US politics. Sun was apprehended on Thursday on charges of acting as an illegal agent for the Chinese government and conspiring to influence a local election in Southern California to advance China’s foreign policy interests.Authorities allege Sun collaborated with Chinese officials to support a politician sympathetic to Beijing’s agenda. The arrest comes amid growing concerns over China's alleged efforts to influence local US elections by backing candidates supportive of Beijing’s interests. Prosecutors claim Sun conspired with Chen Jun , a fellow Chinese national who was sentenced last month to 20 months in prison for acting as an illegal agent of the Chinese government.Chen, 71, previously pleaded guilty to bribing federal agents to target the anti-Beijing group Falun Gong. Court documents reveal that Chen also collaborated with Sun to meddle in local elections.The case is part of a broader trend of scrutiny toward Beijing's efforts to influence US governance through local channels, including covert operations and influence campaigns targeting local and state politicians.Sun's arrest follows the conviction of Chen Jun, another Chinese national, who was sentenced to 20 months in prison for acting as an illegal agent of the Chinese government. Authorities have highlighted the involvement of both men in promoting pro-Beijing agendas and influencing elected officials, particularly on sensitive topics like Taiwan.","Yaoning Sun is a Chinese national residing in Chino Hills, California, and has been charged with acting as an unregistered foreign agent.

Biden napped as military families waited for bodies; White House says 'never happened',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-napped-as-military-families-waited-for-bodies-white-house-says-never-happened/articleshow/116544910.cms,"US President Joe Biden has been facing severe backlash from the grieving families of US Marines killed in the Kabul bombing. The families allege that they were kept waiting for hours while the President took a nap on Air Force One.On 26 August, 13 American soldiers and more than 170 Afghans were killed in a devastating attack at Kabul's Abbey Gate during the chaotic final days of the American pullout from Afghanistan.The families were waiting for the ""dignified transfer"" ceremony at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, where President Biden and First Lady Jill Biden were expected to receive the caskets of the fallen soldiers. However, relatives allege that they were forced to wait for an additional three hours before the bodies of their loved ones were returned.They also claim that during the whole time, President Biden was asleep on the plane instead of greeting them as per the New York Post.Roice McCollum, whose brother Rylee was killed in the bombing, said that Biden’s decision to nap was an insult to the memory of their fallen family members and that a military officer informed her of the President’s rest.“Made us wait an extra three hours to receive the bodies of our dead family members because he couldn’t pull it together,” McCollum told the Daily Mail.This account was confirmed by other families, including Darin Hoover, the father of staff sergeant Taylor Hoover, and Christy Shamblin, the mother-in-law of Marine sergeant Nicole Gee. Both soldiers were among those killed in the Kabul attack.Hoover expressed his frustration, saying, “We sat in that office for what seemed like an eternity waiting on the doddering old fool.”The widely criticised US withdrawal from Afghanistan, which marked a low point in Biden’s presidency, had already sparked anger among military families, particularly after footage emerged showing the President checking his watch during the dignified transfer ceremony at Dover.Despite the backlash, White House allies and a spokesperson have denied the claims, insisting that the reports of Biden’s nap were untrue and never happened.“That claim is untrue. As President Biden said on the 4th anniversary of the tragic attack on Abbey Gate and in the letters he wrote to family members after meeting with them in Dover, ‘these 13 Americans — and the many more that were wounded — were patriots in the highest sense’ and ‘we owe them and their families a sacred debt we will never be able to fully repay, but will never cease working to fulfill,” a White House spokesman stated.However, for the families of the fallen, the incident has added to their grief, leaving many feeling their loved ones' sacrifice was not properly honoured.",Families of US Marines killed in the Kabul bombing allege that they were kept waiting for hours while the President took a nap on Air Force One. 13 American soldiers and more than 170 Afghans were killed in a devastating attack at Kabul's Abbey Gate during the chaotic final days of the American pullout from Afghanistan.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116545041,imgsize-139026,width-400,resizemode-4/116545041.jpg"
President Musk: Trump was not bothered by 'President Musk' chatter: 'Nothing that Elon posted...',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-was-not-bothered-by-president-musk-chatter-nothing-that-elon-posted-/articleshow/116543254.cms,"While Elon Musk reacted to the 'President Musk' buzz, Donald Trump was not bothered by it.



What Elon Musk said about 'President Musk' chatter

Fox News host Lawrence Jones claimed President-elect Donald Trump was not at all bothered by the ' President Musk ' chatter on social media because nothing that Elon Musk posted contradicted Donald Trump and it was Trump who authorized Musk to make those posts as 'they're in lockstep'. The 'President Musk' chatter was only for social media and the Dems though Trump's team did not allow the speculations to grow as put a 'full stop' asserting that Donald Trump was calling the shots.The controversy started over the spending bill against which Elon Musk made over 80 posts on X, the social media platform he owns. Democrats and some Republicans too questioned what government experience Elon Musk had to dictate Congress members to reject the bill. Donald Trump and JD Vance's joint statement came later and Congress sank into a 72-hour logjam with the threats of a government shutdown which was averted last night.Fox's Lawrence Jones said he spoke with Trump amid the chaos and Trump did not show any lack of confidence in Speaker Mike Johnson who brought the bipartisan bill that was rejected by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. “I asked him about Mike Johnson because he brought this to the floor, and no one expected this amount of Republicans to vote against it,” Jones noted, reading from his phone. “And he said, ‘I have full confidence in Mike Johnson. He said this is not Mike Johnson. The Freedom Caucus blew it up.’”Jones revealed that Donald Trump was prepared for a shutdown. On being asked whether he could sense any uneasiness over social media claiming Musk to be the president, Jones said Trump is too thick-skinned to be perturbed by these taunts and he's the one who told Musk to post about the spending bills.“No, it did not bother the president,” Jones concluded. “As I said yesterday, the Musk tweet was a warning shot from the president. They are in lockstep on this. This is why the president appointed him for this commission — him and Vivek [Ramaswamy]. They are doing what the president wants them to do.”Elon Musk said it was a strategy of the legacy media to weaken his relationship with Trump. ""That is exactly the goal. The political & legacy media puppets all got their new instructions yesterday and are now parroting the same message to drive a wedge between@realDonaldTrump and me. They will fail.""Apart from President Musk, there was a demand of 'Speaker Musk' which came from the Republicans. Musk was asked on Thursday whether he wanted to be the Speaker. ""Should I be?"" he said.","The controversy started over the spending bill against which Elon Musk made over 80 posts on X, the social media platform he owns.

"1,566 terror attacks killed 924 in Pakistan over past 10 months",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/1566-terror-attacks-killed-924-in-pakistan-over-past-10-months/articleshow/116551393.cms,"KARACHI: Ten years have passed since Ajoon Khan's son died in a ghastly attack by the Pakistani Taliban that killed about 150 people, mostly children, at a military-run school in Peshawar, in northwestern Pakistan. But the pain of loss is unrelenting - it grows only deeper with time. Khan, a lawyer, said he could never forget the parents sobbing and pleading outside the school gates.The brutal assault on the school in Peshawar led to rare political unity in support of a comprehensive counterterrorism strategy for Pakistan and a vast military operation in the country's former tribal areas near Afghanistan. The efforts forced militants to retreat across the border and brought a degree of relative peace to Pakistan. Large-scale terrorist attacks were significantly reduced, with fatalities dropping from 2,451 across 1,717 attacks in 2013 to 220 in 146 attacks in 2020. But the hard-won gains are now in jeopardy.Over the past few years, violence by the Pakistani Taliban and other Islamic militant groups has surged in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, in northwestern Pakistan. Experts attribute the increase to the Afghan Taliban's seizure of power in neighbouring Afghanistan in Aug 2021.Last week, the interior ministry reported that 924 people, including civilians and law enforcement personnel, had been killed in 1,566 terrorist attacks across the country over the past 10 months. It said 341 terrorists had been killed during the period.Early on Saturday, sixteen soldiers were killed in northwest Pakistan in an attack by Islamist militants, a senior police official in the South Waziristan region said. Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), also known as the Pakistan Taliban, claimed responsibility for the attack, giving a higher figure for the number of personnel killed, Reuters reported.Experts and security officials have identified a range of challenges impeding Pakistan's progress against terrorism: political instability, weak governance, dwindling public support, economic constraints and reduced US counterterrorism assistance after the end of the 20-year war in Afghanistan.""The greatest challenge lies in mobilising the necessary financial resources and manpower for operations across such vast regions,"" said Muhammad Amir Rana, director of the Pak Institute for Peace Studies, a security think tank in Islamabad. The source of the problem for Pakistan, experts say, is found across the border, in Afghanistan.The Taliban administration in Kabul, the Afghan capital, denies accusations of harbouring militants from TTP. But Asfandyar Mir, a senior expert at the United States Institute of Peace, said the TTP had been given ""a permissive safe haven in Afghanistan,"" which had allowed it to become ""resilient and lethal.""Pakistani security officials privately acknowledged that they had misjudged how the new Taliban rulers of Afghanistan would handle TTP. The officials had anticipated that the Taliban leaders would help curb the TTP in return for the covert support that Pakistan had provided them during the US-led war. Instead, the Taliban in Kabul have provided the TTP with resources and advanced American-made weapons and equipment seized after the collapse of the US-supported Afghan govt, according to a senior security official in Islamabad who spoke on the condition of anonymity.The TTP has gone on to unleash a wave of attacks inside Pakistan as it wages a campaign whose aim is to overthrow the govt. Among them was a suicide bombing in January 2023 that killed over 100 people at a mosque in Peshawar.Pakistani security forces have also been locked in a conflict with ethnic separatist groups in Balochistan, an arid province bordering Afghanistan and Iran that is home to the Chinese-run port Gwadar. nyt","Violence by the Pakistani Taliban and other Islamic militant groups has surged in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, in northwestern Pakistan. Experts attribute the increase to the Afghan Taliban's seizure of power in neighbouring Afghanistan in Aug 2021. 16 soldiers killed in northwest Pakistan in an attack by Islamist militants.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116551444,imgsize-1277581,width-400,resizemode-4/116551444.jpg"
