'JD Vance understood': Shashi Tharoor in US on Operation Sindoor; says 'India won the narrative',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jd-vance-understood-shashi-tharoor-in-us-on-operation-sindoor-says-india-won-the-narrative/articleshow/121662738.cms,".

Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Thursday said that US vice president JD Vance understood there could be no mediation between India and Pakistan, as it would imply an equivalence between the two countries.Speaking in Washington, Tharoor, who leads Group 5 of the all-party delegation tasked with conveying India's message against terrorism abroad, said they made India’s position “very clear” to the US vice president.Tharoor said, “The meeting with VP Vance was very clear. Mediation implies an equivalence between two parties, and there can be no equivalence between terrorists and their victims. Vance fully understood our points, and so did other levels of the system.”Commenting on the Pakistani delegation also visiting the United States, Tharoor said the Americans who met the Pakistani delegation had not publicly expressed any support for the country. “We've seen some of them tweeting about their meetings. But we haven’t seen those they met say anything publicly supportive or appreciative of Pakistan,” he said.Speaking about the Pakistani delegation in the United States, Tharoor noted that the people the Pakistani delegation met in the US didn't say anything supportive of Pakistan.""We've seen some of them tweeting about their meetings. We've not seen the people they met saying anything very supportive or appreciative of Pakistan in public.""He also underlined the strength of India’s diplomatic outreach, saying the Indian team had more meetings and at a higher level. “Whether it was Senators and Congressmen on the Hill or government officials, our list of appointments was far better,” he said. “We’ve got the better of the argument.”On various statements coming from the Congress, Tharoor stressed that any internal Congress discussions would take place later. “There'll be a time for internal discussions when one gets back. I'm not anticipating anything because I've not been told anything directly. All I see is in the media, some of which is speculative. But on the whole, my view is that we are facing a situation where the country is united. And that unity was very apparent in the delegation. ""Reflecting on the five-day effort, Tharoor called the visit a success. “We had good conversations, high-level contacts, and clear outcomes. We got our message across about Pahalgam and Operation Sindoor and reaffirmed India’s relations globally.”","Congress MP Shashi Tharoor said US vice president JD Vance understood there could be no mediation between India and Pakistan.

FULL: ‘Trump Won’t Tolerate...’: US State Dept Warns After Decision To Revoke Chinese Student Visas





US President Donald Trump issued a proclamation suspending international visas for new Harvard University students, as announced by the White House on Wednesday. This action represents a significant intensification of efforts to prevent foreign students from attending this prestigious institution.The directive halts entry for new Harvard students under F, M, or J visa categories and instructs the Secretary of State to evaluate revoking existing visas for current students meeting specific criteria, according to the White House statement on Wednesday.Citing national security concerns, the White House expressed apprehension about Harvard's foreign connections. The administration criticised the university's alleged inadequate reporting of foreign student information, noting deficiencies in data submission for three students.The White House statement claimed Harvard either inadequately reports foreign student disciplinary records or insufficiently monitors these students. Additional criticisms included the university's handling of antisemitism and its continued emphasis on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI).Also read: 'Retaliatory step': Trump blocks visas for new foreign students at Harvard; here's how the University responded The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has long warned that foreign adversaries take advantage of easy access to American higher education to steal information, exploit research and development, and spread false information, as per the White House.""Harvard has also developed extensive entanglements with foreign adversaries, receiving more than $150 million from China alone. In exchange, Harvard has, among other things, hosted Chinese Communist Party paramilitary members and partnered with China-based individuals on research that could advance China’s military modernization,"" the White House said in a statement.""Harvard has failed to adequately address violent anti-Semitic incidents on campus, with many of these agitators found to be foreign students."" it added.The President said that there are people who wants to go to Harvard but they can't get in because of foreign students. He also said that they are waiting for the foreign student lists from Harvard so that the administration can determine how many ""radicalized lunatics, troublemakers all"" should not be let back into the US.“The students? Well, we want to have great students here. We just don’t want students that are causing trouble. We want to have students. I want to have foreign students. We have people who want to go to Harvard and other schools, they can’t get in because we have foreign students there. But I want to make sure that the foreign students are people that can love our country,"" he said.“We are still waiting for the Foreign Student Lists from Harvard so that we can determine, after a ridiculous expenditure of BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, how many radicalized lunatics, troublemakers all, should not be let back into our Country. Harvard is very slow in the presentation of these documents, and probably for good reason!” Trump added.This development came after US District Court Judge Allison Burroughs's recent ruling, which indefinitely prevented the Trump administration from modifying Harvard's international student visa programme. This ruling came shortly after the judge temporarily stopped the administration's attempt to revoke the university's authority to enrol international students.The ongoing showdown stems from Harvard's refusal to submit to a series of federal government demands. The situation escalated recently after the department of homeland security said Harvard refused to provide records related to misconduct by foreign students.Trump had already froze more than $2.2 billion in funding and now had terminated $450 million in grants to the country's oldest university.Members of the Republican Party have introduced new bills aimed at substantially raising tax rates on endowments held by elite universities, with Harvard being a primary target. The former president had previously indicated his intention to revoke the university's tax exemption privileges.Following the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, the US President has repeatedly criticised the university for its perceived inadequate protection of Jewish students. In response, Harvard has broadened its legal challenge against the Trump administration, contesting both the suspension of federal funding and what the institution considers to be demands that compromise its autonomy and violate constitutional principles.",US President Donald Trump issued a proclamation suspending international visas for new Harvard University students.

US correspondent from US: An Indian parliamentary team tasked with highlighting Pakistan's terrorist depredations has conveyed to US interlocutors that New Delhi will not talk to Islamabad ""with a gun pointed to our head"" even as a Pakistani delegation tailing the Indian team in Washington DC desperately sought President Trump's mediation between the two sides.Summing up India's stance, delegation leader Shashi Tharoor likened Pakistan to a neighbor who ""unleashes a rottweiler to bite your children and do worse and then says 'let's talk."" Talks are not possible unless Pakistan locks up the rottweilers (terrorists) or puts them to sleep, Tharoor said.Tharoor also rejected efforts to insinuate US into bilateral issues saying India has enormous respect for the American presidency and the American president, but ""we have never particularly wanted to ask anyone to mediate.""The Indian delegation met US vice-president JD Vance at the White House on Thursday morning to convey India's stance. Vance, who initially said the India-Pakistan scrap was ""not our business"" as New Delhi launched punitive strikes against Pakistan for the Pahalgam terrorist attacks, virtually greenlighting the retribution, later jumped into the fray to bring about a truce.India has since made it clear that he was merely conveying Pakistan's desire to stand down, and New Delhi will not brook any mediation.""Excellent meeting with Vice President @JDVance today in Washington D.C. with our delegation. We had comprehensive discussions covering a wide array of critical issues, from counter-terrorism efforts to enhancing technological cooperation. A truly constructive & productive exchange for strengthening India-US strategic partnership, with a great meeting of minds,"" Tharoor said after the meeting.At a press conference hours before the team met Vance, Tharoor said India can speak all the languages Pakistan speaks and is happy to talk to them in any of them if they roll up their terrorism policy and infrastructure, ""but as long as they use the language of terrorism, we will use the language of force.That doesn't require a third party,"" even as the team from Islamabad, in its meetings, rolled out the familiar trope of ""Pakistan is a victim of terrorism,"" which the Indian delegation ridiculed.In one vivid presentation, BJP MP Tejasvi Surya listed five Pakistanis and five Indians who are famous in the US to highlight the difference between the two countries. For Pakistan: Ramzi Yousuf, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, Faisal Shahzad, Tashfeen Malik, and Muhammad Shahzeb Khan -- all of whom conducted terrorist attacks on the US. For India: Indra Nooyi, Satya Nadella, Sundar Pichai, Ajay Banga, Arvind Krishna -- all corporate titans who have generated billions in economic activity in the US.""India gives tech titans, Pak gives terrorists,"" Surya noted.The Indian delegation met US vice-president JD Vance on Thursday morning to convey India's stand after engaging dozens of US lawmakers from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the India Caucus, which has nearly 200 legislators, including 40 Senators, compared to the Pakistan Caucus, which has only around 50 members -- a differential the Indian side mentioned to highlight the breadth of support for India.The Pakistani team meanwhile labored to make an impression on the few meetings its cobbled together on the Hill, insisting that the Kashmir issue was an “unfinished agenda of the United Nations” despite being outed repeatedly on UN resolutions that seek Pakistan's withdrawal from the territory it has occupied.""Raised concerns over India’s recent provocations, the deepening humanitarian crisis in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu & Kashmir,"" Bhutto posted on X after one such meeting, even though there is no humanitarian crisis in J&K other than terrorist attacks initiated by Pakistan.

NEW DELHI: Russia appeared to be buying into US President Donald Trump's claim that he mediated the ""ceasefire"" in the India-Pakistan military conflict that followed India's Operation Sindoor strikes on terrorist camps in Pakistan.A ccording to President Vladimir Putin's aide Yury Ushakov, the issue figured in the ""highly productive and positive"" talks that Putin had with Trump on Wednesday. In his account of the conversation, Ushakov said other than Ukraine, a number of other international issues were raised ""as well as the armed conflict between India and Pakistan, which has been halted with the personal involvement of President Trump"".Putin strongly condemned the Pahalgam attack and also backed India's efforts to bring perpetrators to justice. However, Ushakov's remark about Trump's role is unlikely to go down well with Indian authorities who have repeatedly denied that the US or any other country brought the conflict to an end. India also rejected Trump's offer of mediation on the Kashmir issue, saying it will always engage bilaterally with Pakistan.External affairs minister S Jaishankar had said earlier that while American leaders were in touch with India and Pakistan, the pause in fighting was directly negotiated by the Indian and Pakistani armies, after Pakistan reached out to India for a dialogue. US secretary of commerce Howard Lutnick had later said on oath in a US court that Trump had used trade to avert a full-scale war between the ""nuclear armed"" countries.Putin is likely to visit India later this year for the annual India-Russia summit.

‘Chinese Kill Chain Couldn’t…’: Tharoor Mocks Pakistan & Its Cabal As US Officials Stare In Shock

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor , who is leading a parliamentary delegation to the United States in a diplomatic outreach to highlight India's firm stance against terrorism, launched a scathing attack and called out the nation's long-standing policy of harbouring terrorism.Taking aim at Pakistan's parallel delegation led by former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto , Tharoor invoked Hillary Clinton's famous rebuke: ""How can you breed vipers in your backyard and expect them to bite only your neighbours?""The diplomatic face-off in Washington comes in the wake of Operation Sindoor , following the Pahalgam terror attack. While India has deployed seven delegations across 33 countries, Pakistan's smaller diplomatic initiative covers just five capitals - Washington, New York, Brussels, London, and Moscow.Tharoor's delegation has embarked on a comprehensive outreach program in Washington, including appearances at the National Press Club, meetings with diaspora media, and a reception hosted by the ambassador. ""The message must be spread as widely as possible — through media, diaspora, and direct government outreach,"" he said.“Indeed, I know that Bilawal Bhutto's mother was killed and one sympathise with the young man for the loss of his mother to terrorism,” he added.Addressing Pakistan's diplomatic efforts, Tharoor remarked, ""They can come with their narratives... But anybody who has followed this issue beyond official headlines will have absolutely no doubt as to what the Pakistani denials are worth — which is not very much.""Pakistan's mission seeks international mediation and the revival of the Indus Waters Treaty , which India suspended on April 23 in response to the Pahalgam attack which claimed lives of 26 people.Speaking about India's suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, Tharoor had earlier stated in Colombia, ""The time for acting on the basis of goodwill unilaterally is frankly no longer with us.""Despite India's strong stance, Tharoor highlighted the country's balanced approach, noting, ""We sympathise with victims of terror wherever they may be. I remember Parliament once passed a resolution condemning a terrorist attack that killed 40 schoolchildren in Pakistan. But it's very difficult to sympathise with the Pakistani authorities who have unfortunately created this phenomenon.""",Congress MP Shashi Tharoor is leading a parliamentary delegation to the United States in a diplomatic outreach to highlight India's firm stance against terrorism.

He was explaining his biting remarks that were apparently directed at Congress officebearers who ran down the govt campaign.Khurshid termed the trip as successful after his delegation met with external affairs minister S Jaishankar for a briefing. Congress MP Manish Tewari too praised his delegation's efforts in Gulf and African countries, where it effectively ""busted false equivalence"" Pakistan has drawn between Palestine and Kashmir, and sensitised the hosts about Pakistan's terror agenda against India.Congress MP Shashi Tharoor , who is leading a delegation that is in the US at present, said, ""I think anybody who thinks that working in national interest is some sort of anti-party activity really needs to question themselves rather than us.""However, unfazed by the criticism of these party members, Congress continued its offensive against the programme, saying the foreign visits achieved little with the delegations failing to meet big leaders in host countries.When asked about Khurshid's praise of the outreach, All India Congress Committee spokesman Ajoy Kumar said the issue was not about any party or individual because it is govt that decides the script for any such delegation. ""And the problem is that govt did not give the script,"" he felt.Kumar added that the delegations did not even name China as the force behind Pakistan's devious agenda or call out US president Donald Trump for his claim that he was behind Indo-Pak ceasefire. ""The media was busy pitting Congress against Congress by talking about Tharoor, etc, but this was Modi's surrender,"" he claimed.Nevertheless, Khurshid stuck to his guns and said he had been in touch with the party high command throughout the tour.Citing an example of what the trip had achieved, he said Pakistan had to issue a ""frustrated press release"" after his delegation's three-day visit to Malaysia.""While some questions were raised by Malaysia, given its strong membership of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, we received a firm letter of support from the prime minister of Malaysia. We saw no indication of any hesitation in backing India,"" Khurshid pointed out.","Khurshid termed the trip as successful after his delegation met with external affairs minister S Jaishankar for a briefing.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif has urged the US to broker a ""comprehensive dialogue"" between India and Pakistan. Addressing an event at the US embassy in Islamabad on Wednesday, Sharif lauded US President Donald Trump for what he said was his role in defusing a four-day military clash last month that was triggered by the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that claimed 26 lives. India has rejected all claims of a US role in bringing about a cessation of hostilities.Sharif's praise for Trump as a leader ""against escalation and war"" was mirrored by Pakistan Peoples Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari in Washington. Bilawal credited Trump's diplomacy for the ceasefire and suggested that US mediation could facilitate broader talks. ""If America can help sustain this ceasefire, its role in arranging a comprehensive dialogue would benefit both nations,"" he said. This appeal to Trump's deal-making persona has sparked suspicion in India, where analysts see it as Pakistan's attempt to shift focus from its alleged role in cross-border terrorism and regain diplomatic leverage.Sharif's call for dialogue signals willingness to engage but raises questions about Pakistan's commitment to India's concerns, especially after dismissing the Simla Agreement and seeking US involvement.","Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif has urged the US to broker a ""comprehensive dialogue"" between India and Pakistan.

NEW DELHI: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on Thursday urged that the political consensus and swift government response seen after the Pahalgam terror attack in April should become a lasting feature of India’s national security approach.Speaking at the concluding event of the Karyakarta Vikas Varg in Nagpur, he praised the collective political will and military resolve demonstrated in the aftermath of the attack.“Action was taken after the heinous terror attack in Pahalgam. The valour of our Army shone once again in it. The firmness of the administration was also seen. The political class showed mutual understanding. The society gave the message of unity. This should continue and become a permanent feature,” Bhagwat said, referring to retaliatory actions under Operation Sindoor , including strikes on terror hubs in Pakistan and PoK.He said the people were angry after the massacre of tourists in Pahalgam on April 22 and wanted justice, which led to the military response. Operation Sindoor marked a significant escalation, with Indian armed forces bombing terror-linked airbases in Pakistan and repelling drone attacks.Bhagwat warned that enemies were engaged in a proxy war against India. “Those who can't win a direct fight with India want to bleed our country by the policy of a thousand cuts,” he said, invoking Winston Churchill’s WWII speech to highlight societal resilience.“Churchill had said that society was the true lion, and he merely roared on its behalf.”He further called for national unity and restraint, cautioning against provocation and internal conflict. “No group or class should come into conflict with another. Acting impulsively or taking the law into one’s own hands is not in the country’s interest.”Bhagwat came down strongly against religious conversion through coercion or inducement, calling it a form of violence. “Conversion is violence. We are not against it when done by choice. But luring, forcing and pressurising is something we are against,” he said, adding that such acts insult people’s ancestors and heritage. “We are with you (in the fight against conversion),” he told tribal leader and former Union minister Arvind Netam, who was present as chief guest.Netam, hailing from Chhattisgarh, echoed these concerns and criticised successive governments for ignoring religious conversions in tribal areas. “I think RSS is the only institution which can help us in this area,” he said, urging the Sangh to push the central government for a post-Naxalism action plan to prevent recurrence.He also criticised the non-implementation of the Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996 (PESA), saying it was vital for tribal self-governance and community empowerment.Earlier, in an interview with Organiser, Bhagwat had said India must become militarily and economically self-reliant, asserting, “We have no option but to be powerful as we have been witnessing the wickedness of the evil forces on all our borders.” He emphasised that true strength must be matched with righteousness, or it risks becoming directionless and violent.The RSS chief concluded that unity, moral strength, and readiness are the pillars of a resilient and powerful India. “Our roots lie in unity, not in division,” he said.","RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat calls for lasting political unity post-Pahalgam attack.

Elon and Donald: The Fallout



The Ketamine Candidate

The Campaign Trail Becomes a Custody Battle

Governing with a Chainsaw

Exit Wounds





In Quentin Tarantino’s Kill Bill: Volume 1, the Bride doesn’t just seek revenge—she draws blood with elegance, precision, and a katana. Elon Musk , freshly unshackled from his stint inside Trump’s government, seems to be channelling the same energy—only this time, the blade is fiscal discipline, and the target is Donald Trump ’s so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill.”On Wednesday, Musk tweeted to his 180 million followers with a message that could’ve come straight out of Tarantino’s trailer: “Call your Senator. Call your Congressman. Bankrupting America is NOT ok! KILL the BILL.” Attached was a photoshopped poster of Kill Bill, with Trump’s face clumsily plastered over David Carradine’s and the bill clutched like a samurai scroll of doom.The Bill in question? H.R.1, passed by the House on May 22. A sprawling $4 trillion mega-package that extends Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, pumps funds into border security, expands defence spending—and raises the debt ceiling to eyewatering new heights. MAGA Republicans call it “historic.” Musk calls it “a disgusting abomination.”Only days ago, Musk was working inside the belly of the beast as head of DOGE—Trump’s ironically titled Department of Government Efficiency. Appointed as a “special government employee,” he spent 130 days trying to trim Washington’s flab.Today, he’s torching it from the outside.“This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination,” Musk posted on X. “Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong.”He followed up with a flurry of economic memes, deficit graphs, and that now-viral Kill Bill parody poster, putting him squarely at odds with the very president who once called him “America’s Tech Da Vinci.”Musk didn’t stop at aesthetics. He’s gone full Paul Revere with PowerPoint slides. Calling the bill “Debt Slavery,” he warned that America is “in the fast lane to fiscal suicide.” By his math, the legislation could blow the deficit past $2.5 trillion and inflate the national debt by as much as $5 trillion—figures echoed, though slightly more cautiously, by the Congressional Budget Office.“This spending bill contains the largest increase in the debt ceiling in US history!” Musk wrote. “Congress is making America bankrupt.”Some in the GOP are rattled. Musk was the largest Republican donor of the 2024 election cycle—and now he’s threatening to fund primary challenges against any lawmaker backing the bill. “In November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people,” he posted, turning his money cannon on the very party he helped prop up.The White House, meanwhile, responded with Trumpian defiance. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt shrugged it off: “This is one big, beautiful bill, and he’s sticking to it.”Trump even posted a nostalgic screenshot of Musk thanking him for the DOGE appointment—equal parts reminder and rebuke. House Speaker Mike Johnson tried to reach out. Musk left him on read, then shared a video clip of Johnson’s defence of the bill with a blunt caption: “We need a new bill that doesn’t grow the deficit.”Senator Kevin Cramer was less concerned. “I don’t think very many senators are that interested in what Elon has to say,” he told reporters. “It’s amusing. But we’re serious policymakers.”Some men campaign. Elon Musk campaigned on something. What that ""something"" was, in hindsight, feels like a mix of politics, pharmaceuticals, vanity, and chaos theory.Musk’s drug use didn’t begin with the Trump campaign—it simply became more theatrical. While the Wall Street Journal had reported as early as 2023 that Tesla board members were alarmed by his use of Ambien, The New York Times now paints a darker picture.By 2024, Musk was reportedly taking ketamine so frequently it affected his bladder function. MDMA and psilocybin mushrooms followed, often at private parties across the globe. One image reviewed by NYT showed a pill organiser containing around 20 substances—some labelled as Adderall.The effect? Public incoherence, private panic. What Musk claimed was bi-weekly therapeutic use looked, to many insiders, like daily microcosmic meltdown.Musk didn’t just endorse Trump—he practically embedded himself in the campaign. He appeared at rallies, brought his son X into the Oval Office, and travelled with the child on the trail.Grimes, the boy’s mother, objected—saying it violated a custody agreement. But that was just one chapter in Musk’s domestic soap opera. In February, right-wing influencer Ashley St. Clair revealed she had given birth to Musk’s 14th child. She claimed Musk offered $15 million and $100,000 a month to keep it quiet. When she refused, Musk filed for a gag order.Simultaneously, Neuralink executive Shivon Zilis was pregnant with two more of Musk’s children via surrogate—reportedly unaware of St. Clair. If his public persona was spiralling, his private life was already in freefall.Inside the administration, things were just as unhinged. After Trump’s win, Musk helped design DOGE, rented a cottage at Mar-a-Lago, and joined transition calls with foreign leaders. But colleagues quickly became alarmed.He insulted cabinet members, showed up disoriented to briefings, and raised eyebrows at the inauguration with what neuroscientist Philip Low later condemned as a Nazi-style salute. At CPAC, he donned sunglasses, accepted a chainsaw on stage, and delivered a performance that many said looked more like Burning Man than Beltway.His exit in May 2025 wasn’t shocking. The only surprise was that it hadn’t come sooner.Musk’s departure from government wasn’t a clean break. It was a scorched-earth retreat. He arrived as a tech messiah, a billionaire savant here to trim the fat of government. He left as a psychedelic Cassandra—raging on social media, estranged from his allies, and battling legislation he once helped shape.",Elon Musk is taking aim at Donald Trump's 'One Big Beautiful Bill' Musk was the largest Republican donor of the 2024 election cycle.

BENGALURU: A senior Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) official was among four people arrested by Bengaluru police on Friday in connection with the deadly stampede that killed 11 people and injured 75 others outside Chinnaswamy Stadium.The other three arrested are employees of the event management firm, DNA Entertainment.The Bengaluru police confirmed on Friday that Nikhil Sosale, Head of Business Partnerships at RCB and Sports Marketing Business at Diageo India was taken into custody alongside Sunil Mathew, Director and Vice President (Business Affairs) at DNA Entertainment Networks and two other employees of the same event management firm – Sumanth and Nikhil Kumar.All four were detained after midnight and subjected to prolonged questioning, a senior police officer told TOI, the arrests came just hours after Seemant Kumar Singh officially took over as the city’s police commissioner late on Thursday night.The Cubbon Park police have filed a suo motu complaint, naming the RCB franchise as the first accused, DNA Entertainment as the second and the Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) administrative committee as the third.The case has been registered under multiple sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), including culpable homicide not amounting to murder, voluntarily causing hurt and endangering life, among others.A second FIR has also been filed based on a complaint from one of the injured survivors, Rolongumes, a 25-year-old from Mylasandra, West Bengaluru.The arrests follow a high-level crackdown by the Karnataka government, which also suspended five senior police officers, including Bengaluru Police Commissioner B Dayananda. Three of those suspended are IPS officers.The stampede occurred on Wednesday afternoon, just before RCB’s planned victory parade following their maiden Indian Premier League (IPL) title win.Thousands of fans had gathered around the stadium, overwhelming security and logistical arrangements.A special investigation team from the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) will now lead the probe.One of the FIRs, filed suo motu by a police officer, named RCB as the first accused, event organiser DNA Entertainment Networks as the second and the Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) as the third.The complaint alleges that the three entities “pressured” police to go ahead with the celebration despite law enforcement’s concerns over crowd control.""Prima facie, it appears there was negligence and apathy on the part of the organisers, and this led to the tragedy,"" CM Siddaramaiah said. “These stern decisions have been taken after reviewing the available evidence and statements of senior police officers and ministers.”In a separate development, the Karnataka high court has taken suo motu cognisance of the incident and issued a notice to the state government, demanding a detailed status report on the security arrangements and the circumstances leading to the stampede.Authorities are also facing criticism for failing to anticipate the massive turnout for the parade, with grieving families and opposition leaders questioning the lack of coordination between the organisers, police and government officials.","Nikhil Sosale, Head of Business Partnerships at RCB and Sports Marketing Business at Diageo India was taken into custody.

RAIPUR: In a moment of recklessness, an Innova driver swung open the door to spit gutkha while speeding at more than 100kmph, causing the MUV to flip over and crash, killing a businessman and critically injuring two men in Chhattisgarh’s Bilaspur on Monday.The Innova went somersaulting down the road, hitting two vehicles and injuring one of their drivers.Police said the deceased, Jackie Gehi, 31, a cloth merchant from Chakarbhatha on the outskirts of Bilaspur — 100km from Raipur — had gone to a late-night party on Sunday and called a friend, Akash Chandani, around 1.30am to pick him up. Akash arrived with another friend, Pankaj Chhabra, in an Innova.Akash was driving, Pankaj sat in the front passenger seat, and Jackie was in the back. On Bilaspur-Raipur highway, Akash suddenly opened the door while driving to spit gutkha. He instantly lost control of the vehicle, which swerved into the divider and overturned multiple times.The force of the impact threw all three occupants out of the vehicle, which went hurtling down the highway. Jackie was flung violently and struck a metal structure near the divider, sustaining fatal injuries to his chest, head, and shoulders.He died on the spot. Akash and Pankaj were also ejected and slammed into the ground, suffering grievous injuries.The out-of-control Innova slammed into a parked commercial vehicle, overturned four to five times more, and finally crashed into a parked Ertiga, injuring its driver, who never had a chance to turn on the ignition and get out of harm’s way.The horrifying accident was caught on CCTV. The footage shows the vehicle flipping down the road, and one of the passengers being ejected and slamming into a pole.Emergency services were on the scene swiftly as passersby alerted authorities. Police sealed off the area and hospitalised the injured. The wreckage was later cleared from the road.","Jackie Gehi, 31, a cloth merchant from Chakarbhatha on the outskirts of Bilaspur — 100km from Raipur — died on the spot.

Desolation rent the air at Vydehi Superspeciality Hospital on Vittal Mallya Road as the wail of an inconsolable mother echoed through its corridors: “Chinnu, Chinnu, get up. Your mamma has come, let’s go home. ..”Bhoomik, a college student, and about 10 of his friends had gone to the Chinnaswamy Stadium to watch Rajat Patidar and his men do their lap of victory. As they jostled in a mad rush to enter the stadium, Bhoomik was separated from his friends. It was the last time they saw him alive.“We don’t know what happened, but when we found him, he was lying there, clothes torn,” said one of his friends. “We asked police for help, but they hesitated. Finally, they took us in a police jeep. All along the way to the hospital we tried to revive him by giving him CPR and mouth-tomouth resuscitation. The police dropped us at the hospital and left.”His parents were contacted, and they rushed to the hospital. Bhoomik’s mother believes her only son may have survived had there been proper medical facilities on-site. His father, while comforting his wife, asked, “Why did this happen to my son? If he had told me this morning that he would be going to the stadium, I would not have allowed him to go.Though 21, we looked after him like a baby. He was studious and dreamt of pursuing higher studies. He never hurt anybody but look at what has happened to him.”Adding injury to pain and grief, chief minister Siddaramaiah’s arrival at the hospital delayed the documentation process. His parents pleaded with hospital authorities to release their son’s body, but medical staff were busy attending to the CM.","Bhoomik, a college student, had gone to the Chinnaswamy Stadium to watch Rajat Patidar and his men do their lap of victory.

Who is Geert Wilders? The ‘Right Wing Messiah’ quits Dutch government over immigration,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/who-is-geert-wilders-the-right-wing-messiah-quits-dutch-government-over-immigration/articleshow/121622419.cms,"Geert Wilders: A polarising and popular figure in Netherlands

Shocking win of 2023 that changed everything

The immigration dispute that broke the government

Fury from coalition partners

What happens next for the Netherlands?





The Netherlands has been thrown into political upheaval after Geert Wilders, the far-right populist leader of the Party for Freedom (PVV), pulled his party out of the ruling coalition over disagreements on immigration and asylum policy. This decision, made less than a year after the government was formed, forced Prime Minister Dick Schoof to resign and triggered the collapse of the most right wing administration in Dutch history. Wilders, often dubbed the “Dutch Trump,” cited his unyielding stance on asylum as the reason behind his party’s withdrawal, marking another dramatic turn in his long and polarising political career.Geert Wilders, 61, is one of the most recognised figures in European far right politics. He left the liberal conservative VVD in 2004 to establish the PVV, shaping it into a platform for his anti-Islam, anti-immigration beliefs. Often controversial, Wilders has repeatedly called for banning the Quran and Islamic schools and has openly criticised Dutch multiculturalism. His provocative rhetoric and polarising stances have kept him at the forefront of Dutch politics for two decades, despite multiple legal and political setbacks.In November 2023, Wilders led the PVV to a surprise victory, securing 37 seats and becoming the largest party in parliament. Although coalition partners blocked him from becoming prime minister due to his extreme views, Wilders held significant influence over policy from behind the scenes. The resulting government, a fragile coalition between the PVV, VVD, NSC and BBB, was always tense, and the immigration dispute only widened existing cracks.At the heart of the collapse was Wilders’ hardline 10-point asylum plan. His proposals included deporting all Syrian refugees, militarising borders, suspending EU asylum quotas and banning refugee family reunification. Legal experts argued that many of these violated international human rights agreements. When his coalition partners rejected the proposals, Wilders announced that all PVV ministers would resign, triggering the government's collapse.Coalition leaders condemned Wilders' actions as reckless and self-serving. Dilan Yeşilgöz of the VVD called his withdrawal “super irresponsible,” while other leaders accused him of prioritising personal power over national stability. Prime Minister Dick Schoof described the move as “unnecessary and irresponsible,” lamenting the breakdown of consensus during a time of global instability.With the PVV’s exit, the coalition lost its majority and the Dutch government now operates in caretaker mode. New elections are expected in the autumn. The crisis has also delayed major international decisions, including preparations for a NATO summit and defence budget commitments. Meanwhile, Wilders has vowed to return even stronger in the next election, renewing ambitions to lead the country on his own terms.",The Netherlands has been thrown into political upheaval after Geert Wilders pulled his party out of the ruling coalition.

BENGALURU: Reeling under massive public outrage over the stampede during RCB’s victory celebrations at Bengaluru’s Chinnaswamy Stadium that left 11 dead, Karnataka govt Thursday took an unprecedented step of suspending five senior police officers, including Bengaluru City police commissioner B Dayananda, an IPS officer.This is the first time in Karnataka’s history that a serving police commissioner has been suspended.The other officials suspended are additional commissioner of police (west) Vikash Kumar Vikash, IPS; deputy commissioner of police (central) Shekhar H Tekkannavar, IPS; assistant commissioner of police (Cubbon Park sub-division) Balakrishna C and Cubbon Park police station inspector Girish AK. CM Siddaramaiah said action has been taken against these police officers for dereliction of duty and negligence.The CM also ordered immediate arrest of top officers of RCB, event management firm DNA and Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA). Two FIRs have been registered in this connection and the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) had been tasked with leading the police probe.The CM said, “Prima facie, it appears there was negligence and apathy on the part of the organisers and this led to the tragedy. An incident of this scale had never occurred during my political career since my days as MLA.After having collected evidence and statements from senior police officers and opinions of ministers, these stern decisions have been taken.”The police have been informed as to who of the representatives from the three organisations have to be arrested, the CM said. State home minister G Parameshwara said names of the individuals will become public as soon as arrests are made.On the alleged involvement of a powerful minister behind the hurried celebrations, the CM said: “Let the inquiry report be submitted and action will be initiated against those found guilty.”The govt ordered a one-man commission led by retired justice, John Michael D Cunha, to probe the tragedy and submit a report in 30 days.On Wednesday, two FIRs were registered over the stampede. One case was a suo motu by Cubbon Park police, and the other an FIR based on a complaint filed by an injured person. In the suo motu case, the complaint was filed by police inspector Girish AK. The accused are RCB franchise as accused no. 1, DNA Entertainment accused no. 2, and KSCA administrative committee as accused no. 3.According to Girish, KSCA CEO Shubendu Ghosh approached him around 6pm on June 3 (Tuesday), requesting security arrangements for likely victory celebrations of RCB on the evening of June 4 at the stadium. The inspector denied permission, explaining that if RCB won, the fans would celebrate all night, and proper police security arrangements would have to be made for it.If the victory celebration was organised on June 4, lakhs of fans would attend, causing obstruction to traffic. He explained they would need time to make proper security arrangements. However, KSCA, DNA and RCB “pressured and insisted” on holding the victory celebration, Girish claimed.The case has been registered under the charges of culpable homicide not amounting to murder and other sections. The second complaint is registered under BNS Section 125 A (act endangering life or personal safety of others), based on a complaint by Rolongumes, 25, one of the injured. He has not named anyone in the plaint.","This is the first time in Karnataka’s history that a serving police commissioner has been suspended.

What is Trump derangement syndrome?







The partnership between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump seems to have now cracked. The verbal spat and insults between once allies have been seen all over the internet, with each responding to the other's text.I n response to Musk's critique of the president's spending legislation, which he termed a ""pork-filled Congressional spending bill"" and a ""disgusting abomination"", Trump offered his comments on Thursday. Musk, who recently stepped down from his position as special employee heading the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), had previously contributed approximately £275 million to Trump's campaign.During a Thursday press briefing in the Oval Office, Trump expressed uncertainty about their future relationship despite claiming they ""have a great relationship"". He expressed surprise at the turn of events, noting that at a May 30 press conference marking Musk's departure, they had shared a ""wonderful sendoff"" where Musk ""said wonderful things about me"".Trump expressed disappointment, pointing out that Musk was familiar with the bill's details and hadn't raised objections until after his departure.“I’m very disappointed because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill. He never had a problem until right after he left.”Trump said that others who have left his administration “at some point they miss it so badly” and “some of them actually become hostile. I don’t know what it is, it’s sort of ‘Trump derangement syndrome,’ I guess they call it,” the president said. “They wake up in the morning, the glamor is gone, the whole world is different, and they become hostile.”Trump derangement syndrome was firstly coined by Trump, which he explained as the instinctual negative and often violent reaction to any supportive statement or event related to him.Not only him but also Musk has used the term while giving an interview in February. He called the left “Trump Derangement Syndrome,” and said that he didn't realise it was a real thing until he was at a friend’s dinner party before the presidential election.During a Fox News interview with Sean Hannity, Elon Musk, describing about his friend’s dinner party a month or two ago, compared Trump Derangement Syndrome with rabies.""This whole thing they call Trump Derangement Syndrome - you don’t realize how real it is until you see it. You can’t reason with people,"" Musk said.Strangely, a bill was proposed in Minnesota seeking to classify intense opposition to Donald Trump, termed ""Trump derangement syndrome"", as a mental health condition.The legislation specifically describes this condition as involving ""verbal expressions of intense hostility toward"" Donald Trump and ""overt acts of aggression and violence against anyone supporting [Trump] or anything that symbolises [Trump].""This legislative initiative raises serious concerns about constitutional freedoms, particularly the right to criticise public officials. It potentially creates a precedent for using psychiatric interventions as a means of controlling political dissent. This situation draws parallels to previous instances where mental health practitioners expressed concerns about Trump's psychological state, suggesting he had a serious personality disorder.It is important to note that legitimate psychiatric diagnoses require proper examination by qualified, licensed mental health professionals. The practice of politicians attempting to pathologise their opponents through legislation, as well as mental health professionals offering remote diagnoses of public figures, presents significant risks to societal well-being and professional integrity.","US President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk have been involved in a verbal spat.

CHENNAI: A mix-up of corpses at Tiruvallur govt hospital near Chennai resulted in the body of a 69-year-old local being dispatched to Bihar in an ambulance before officials had the vehicle turn back, when it was more than 800km on its way towards the northern state.The deceased was Rajendran, 69, a labourer who had died Tuesday at the hospital, a day after attempting suicide. The man with whom his body was mixed up was Manoj Manchi, 55, a construction labourer who fell ill and died at the hospital on June 2.After postmortem, hospital handed over a body wrapped in cloth to Rajendran's relatives on Wednesday. When the family members wished to see his face, they were shocked to see it was not Rajendran's body and protested. Hospital staff reviewed CCTV footage in front of the relatives to identify who sent out the wrong body.However, the staff claimed CCTV recordings were incomplete, and they did not have the password to access the footage, which further angered the family and led to arguments with hospital employees and police.Hospital administration launched a search and confirmed the mix-up. A probe revealed that the body given to Rajendran's family was actually that of Manchi.The Bihar man had arrived in Chennai on May 30 and reached a road construction site on June 2. He fell ill and collapsed on the same day and was rushed to the Tiruvallur hospital. A relative from Bihar arrived, claimed a body - apparently without checks - and left in the ambulance.By the time hospital staff contacted the ambulance driver, he was past Hyderabad. He was instructed to return with Rajendran's body. The ambulance reached the hospital Thursday evening.","The deceased was Rajendran, 69, a labourer who had died Tuesday at the hospital.

Trump called Epstein 'terrific guy'

Allegations and controversial plea deal

Epstein’s death

Trump connection





Elon Musk recently reignited public interest in Jeffrey Epstein by claiming on social media that Donald Trump is mentioned in secret government files related to the disgraced financier.Epstein was a convicted sex offender accused of running a vast network of underage girls for sex. He died in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial.Jeffrey Epstein was born and raised in New York. In the mid-1970s, he taught maths and physics at the private Dalton School, despite never graduating from university himself. His connection to wealth began when a parent of one of his students introduced him to a senior partner at Wall Street investment bank Bear Stearns. Epstein quickly rose through the ranks and started his own financial firm, managing billions of dollars in assets.He used his fortune to buy lavish properties, including a Florida mansion, a New Mexico ranch, and what was thought to be the largest private home in New York City. Epstein also mingled with celebrities, politicians, and socialites, often keeping a low profile at public events.Donald Trump once described Epstein as a ""terrific guy"" in a 2002 New York magazine profile, saying: ""He's a lot of fun to be with.It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it - Jeffrey enjoys his social life.""Epstein's criminal activities began coming to light in 2005 when the parents of a 14-year-old girl reported he had molested their daughter at his Palm Beach home. Police investigations uncovered disturbing evidence, including photos of young girls throughout his properties.Despite the charges, Epstein avoided federal prosecution in 2008 through a controversial plea deal that many have since called the ""deal of the century."" He served just 13 months in jail with work release privileges.Alexander Acosta, the federal prosecutor behind the plea deal and later the US Secretary of Labour under Trump, resigned in 2019 amid the scandal but defended his actions as ensuring Epstein spent time in jail.Epstein was arrested again in July 2019 on new sex trafficking charges but died by suicide in his New York jail cell a month later. His death halted what many hoped would be a thorough trial exposing his network of abuse and powerful associates.Since then, legal battles and investigations have continued, including the high-profile trial and conviction of Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s former girlfriend. Maxwell was found guilty in 2021 of helping Epstein recruit and groom minors for abuse and sentenced to 20 years in prison.Donald Trump’s relationship with Epstein has drawn intense scrutiny. While Trump denied visiting Epstein’s private island in the US Virgin Islands, he admitted to knowing him. PolitiFact reported that Trump flew on Epstein’s private jet at least seven times.Recently, Elon Musk claimed on X that Trump’s name appears in sealed government documents related to Epstein’s case.Jeffrey Epstein’s case has left a lasting scar on public consciousness. He once told the New York Post in 2011: ""I'm not a sexual predator, I'm an 'offender.' It's the difference between a murderer and a person who steals a bagel.""His victims and their advocates have pushed for full disclosure of documents and accountability for those connected to his abuse.","Jeffrey Epstein was a convicted sex offender accused of running a vast network of underage girls for sex.

No alternative

Pragmatic radical





DAMASCUS: From wanted jihadist to statesman embraced by world leaders, Syria's interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa has undergone a stunning transformation in just six months since ousting long time strongman Bashar al-Assad.Born in 1982, Sharaa abandoned his nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, trimmed his thick beard and swapped fatigues for a suit and tie since his Islamist coalition of forces seized Damascus on December 8.He was proclaimed interim president the following month, and later tasked with leading his country through a five-year transitional period under a temporary constitution that experts and rights groups said concentrates power in his hands.Appearing calm and soft-spoken, Sharaa has sought to shed many of the attributes that once defined him.Gone is the shadowy persona associated with a single mugshot released at the height of the US-led war in Iraq following his capture there by American forces.Videos posted online in recent weeks have shown him, a tall man, playing basketball in a shirt and tie alongside his foreign minister.Others show him driving his car in Damascus, or eating in a working-class restaurant to cheers from passers-by.""I think he has succeeded in his transformation,"" said Jerome Drevon, a specialist in Islamist militancy at the International Crisis Group.In a matter of months, Sharaa has visited Europe and been ""accepted on the whole in the (Middle East) region -- even by countries like the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia that are not at all supporters of Islamists, much less jihadists"", he added.The reception Sharaa has received demonstrates ""a real recognition of the new authorities"", he told AFP.On Sharaa's first trip to the West last month, he met French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris.Just a week later during a trip to Riyadh, he shook hands with US President Donald Trump who announced Washington would lift sanctions on Syria, a triumph for the new authorities.Trump described Sharaa as a ""young, attractive guy. Tough guy. Strong past. Very strong past. Fighter.""Sharaa remains under United Nations sanctions and a travel ban, and must request an exemption for all foreign trips.Drevon said that Arab and Western countries had made a pragmatic choice by supporting the young leader.""There are still security problems, there are tensions inside the country, but I think that most foreign countries recognise that right now, there is no alternative,"" he said.Sharaa has set up in what was once Assad's presidential palace overlooking Damascus, receiving a steady stream of senior foreign officials.During a Muslim holiday around two months ago, he and his wife Latifa al-Droubi, who now appears with him in public on occasion, welcomed Syrian orphans there.While seeking to distance himself from his guerrilla past, he has sought to extract political capital from his rebel roots.Last week, he presided over a cabinet meeting, saying: ""We came to power through revolution -- we aren't used to luxurious palaces.""""Until two years ago, I didn't even have an office. We used to meet in the car, on the street, under an olive tree,"" he added, referring to his time in the former rebel bastion of Idlib in northwestern Syria.In January, authorities announced the dissolution of all armed groups, including Sharaa's Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which led the lightning offensive that toppled Assad.HTS was known as the Al-Nusra Front before it broke ties with the Al-Qaeda jihadist network in 2016.Sharaa is ""a pragmatic radical"", said Thomas Pierret, a specialist in political Islam.Born in Saudi Arabia, Sharaa is from a well-to-do Syrian family and was raised in Damascus's upscale Mazzeh district.He started studying medicine but then became associated with underground Islamist circles.Following the US-led invasion of neighbouring Iraq in 2003, he and other Syrians crossed the border to join what they saw as a resistance to foreign occupation.He joined Al-Qaeda there, and was subsequently detained for five years.In March 2011, when the revolt against Assad's rule erupted in Syria, Sharaa returned home and founded the Al-Nusra Front.A realist in his partisans' eyes, an opportunist to his adversaries, Sharaa said in May 2015 that he had no intention of launching attacks against the West -- unlike his adversaries in the Islamic State jihadist group.In 2017, Sharaa imposed a merger with HTS on rival Islamist groups in northwestern Syria, claiming control of swathes of Idlib province.HTS went on to develop a civil administration in the area, amid accusations of brutal abuses against those who dared dissent.","Ahmed al-Sharaa has undergone a stunning transformation in just six months since ousting Bashar al-Assad.

A historic fallout with broader implications







In a stunning display of how quickly political alliances can crumble, the once-strong partnership between former President Donald Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk dissolved into a bitter public feud in the last one week.What began as a cordial farewell quickly escalated into a series of explosive accusations, threats, and revelations that have sent shockwaves through both political and business circles.In an interview to CBS, Musk sharply criticised Trump’s legislative proposal. He described the bill as a “massive spending bill” that would escalate the federal deficit while undermining the efficiency of his DOGE team. “I think a bill can be big or it could be beautiful,” Musk stated. “But I don't know if it could be both.” His comments reflect a deep-seated disappointment in the fiscal strategy laid out by Trump, which Musk argues is at odds with the spirit of reform he once championed.Just days ago, Trump heaped praise on Musk during a formal Oval Office farewell, calling him “one of the greatest business leaders and innovators the world has ever produced.” Musk, in turn, pledged to remain an adviser and friend to the president while stepping back from his government role.""The Oval Office finally has the majesty that it deserves thanks to the president,” Musk remarked, admiring Trump’s golden decor. It was a seemingly cordial departure — but one that concealed bubbling policy tensions.The cracks widened when Musk launched a sharp critique of Trump’s prized Congressional budget bill. Taking to X, he called it “a disgusting abomination” and accused lawmakers of betrayal.“I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore… Shame on those who voted for it,” Musk posted, urging voters to oust them in 2025. Notably, Musk avoided naming Trump directly, but his words struck a nerve.Trump did not immediately retaliate. His press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, tried to downplay the criticism, saying it “doesn’t change the president’s opinion.”By Thursday, the gloves were off. In a meeting with the German chancellor, Trump expressed his disappointment: “Elon and I had a great relationship. I don’t know if we will anymore.”The feud intensified across their respective platforms — Trump on Truth Social, Musk on X — with Musk dismissing Trump’s response: “Whatever.” He then credited himself with helping Trump win the 2024 election.“Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,"" Musk claimed.Responding on Truth Social, Trump claimed that Musk had worn out his welcome. He alleged that Musk’s meltdown came after Trump revoked the EV mandate and began altering policies that would affect Tesla’s bottom line.“Elon was ‘wearing thin,’ I asked him to leave… and he just went CRAZY!” Trump wrote, adding that terminating Musk’s governmental subsidies would save “billions and billions of dollars.”He also expressed surprise that President Biden hadn’t already moved to cut Musk’s contracts.Soon after Trump’s threat to cancel contracts, Musk escalated the confrontation by announcing the decommissioning of SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft — a move likely to have implications for NASA collaborations.“In light of the President's statement about cancellation of my government contracts, @SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately,” Musk posted on X.The move was interpreted as a direct challenge to Trump's leverage over federal contracts and the space industry.In a jaw-dropping claim, Musk accused Trump of being mentioned in the Jeffrey Epstein files — a controversial and politically toxic subject in US politics.“Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!” Musk wrote on X.He followed up with: “Mark this post for the future. The truth will come out.”No evidence was presented, and Trump’s FBI leadership had earlier dismissed speculation around Epstein’s death.Trump, continuing his defense of the budget bill, brushed off Musk’s defection but questioned its timing.“I don’t mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago,” he posted, praising the bill as “one of the Greatest Bills ever presented to Congress.”“If this Bill doesn’t pass, there will be a 68% Tax Increase,” he warned, framing it as essential to “Make America Great Again.”Not stopping at budget policy, Musk took aim at Trump’s trade strategies. He warned that the president’s tariff policies could plunge the US into recession by the second half of the year.“The Trump tariffs will cause a recession in the second half of this year,” he posted.This criticism aligned Musk with several fiscal conservatives and global economists concerned about Trump's economic nationalism.In a stunning political twist, Musk signalled support for Trump’s impeachment and floated Vice President JD Vance as a suitable replacement.When right-wing commentator Ian Miles Cheong wrote, “Trump should be impeached and JD Vance should replace him,” Musk responded with a simple but powerful: “Yes.”The endorsement signalled a clear break from Trump and stunned conservative commentators who had long seen Musk as a loyal Trump ally.The rapid deterioration of the Trump-Musk alliance has shocked both political and tech circles. What began as a disagreement over economic policy spiralled into personal accusations, business threats, and one of the most public feuds in recent political history.With Trump heading into a re-election cycle and Musk’s influence over tech, media, and space policy still formidable, the implications of this breakup could ripple across Washington and Silicon Valley alike.","The once-strong partnership between former President Donald Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk dissolved into a bitter public feud in the last one week.

Musk vs Trump: Did Vivek Ramaswamy 'Doge' a bullet by getting out in time?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/musk-vs-trump-did-vivek-ramaswamy-doge-a-bullet-by-getting-out-in-time/articleshow/121664165.cms,"



In Washington’s latest episode of Tech Titans vs MAGA Caesar, D onald Trump has turned on Elon Musk —his former bromantic partner-in-disruption, SpaceX messiah, and self-appointed guardian of Western civilisation. The trigger? Musk labelled Trump’s much-hyped One Big Beautiful Bill “a disgusting abomination” and warned that America was hurtling toward “debt slavery. ”Trump, never one to take offence lightly—or privately—responded with a MAGA-flavoured blitzkrieg. Contracts for Musk’s companies? At risk. His reputation in conservative circles? Torched. “Just another whiny billionaire,” Trump sneered, “who forgot who made him matter.”As the Trump-Musk bromance dissolves faster than a Tesla on Autopilot in Washington traffic, one man watches the fireworks from a safe, well-lit distance—sipping Perrier, adjusting his campaign blazer, and thanking his stars he got out early, having clearly absorbed Sun Tzu’s timeless wisdom: “The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.”—Vivek Ramaswamy.Also read: 'Disgusting abomination' to 'bombshell': Trump & Musk feud spirals; timeline of the public meltdown Once the philosophical darling of the new right, Ramaswamy was handed a shiny new toy in Trump’s second term—DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency.A meme-ified federal Frankenstein, DOGE was Trump’s idea of bureaucratic reform through Silicon Valley swagger. Musk was the co-head. Vivek was the “sane one.” Together, they were meant to revolutionise Washington. Or at least yell at it until it agreed to be disrupted.But like any startup built on vibes and vague mission statements, DOGE began to implode before it launched. Musk wanted to fire half of Washington via app. Trump wanted press conferences with golden eagles and fog machines. And Vivek? Vivek quietly disappeared.Officially, he left to run for Ohio governor. Unofficially, insiders suggest he saw the writing on the Twitter wall —that DOGE was less a reform movement and more a digital kamikaze mission, powered by ego, caffeine, and libertarian hallucinations.And now, in hindsight, his exit looks less like a career pivot and more like a Sun Tzu manoeuvre. Because while Musk is now battling Trump, Congress, and his own booster-fuelled paranoia, Ramaswamy is free to reinvent himself as a centrist tech-whisperer in the Rust Belt. MAGA enough to get the base. Moderate enough to avoid the madness.Except MAGA, like any self-devouring revolution, doesn’t forget. Or forgive.Since stepping away from DOGE and softening his Trumpian rhetoric, Ramaswamy has found himself in the crosshairs of the same base that once anointed him their biotech Brahmin. Hardcore influencers have branded him a traitor. Conservative meme accounts now photoshop him next to Liz Cheney. And in the subterranean rage economy of right-wing internet culture, he's been rebranded from “America First entrepreneur” to “globalist plant with a Harvard tongue. ”Also read: Feud intensifies: Musk shares 1992 video; Trump seen with Jeffrey Epstein in clip The irony? The same mob now grilling Ramaswamy for “disloyalty” is turning on Musk for “disrespect.” In MAGAland, loyalty is a zero-sum blood sport, and the only acceptable exit is the one through public execution.DOGE, predictably, has become a political punchline. It was doomed from conception—run like a Reddit thread, branded like a crypto coin, and staffed by men who confuse spreadsheets with scripture. The only surprising thing is how quickly it crashed. Musk thought he could out-Trump Trump. But in MAGA-land, there can only be one sun god—and he’s orange, not emerald-mined.Ramaswamy, to his credit, didn’t wait around to become collateral damage. He understood what Musk didn’t: that proximity to Trump is radioactive. Stay too long and you mutate. Get out early and you might just survive.The result? Musk is in political freefall. Trump is in attack mode. And Ramaswamy? He’s in Ohio, sipping Perrier and talking about “innovation in public policy”—while ducking MAGA Twitter grenades and hoping they forget he ever existed.Call it foresight. Call it cowardice. Or just call it good political hygiene.Because as Sun Tzu said—he will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight.And in the dystopian sitcom that is American politics, that makes Vivek Ramaswamy the guy who ghosted the group chat before the firestorm—and lived to run another episode.","Vivek Ramaswamy was the co-head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) He left to run for Ohio governor, but insiders suggest he saw the writing on the Twitter wall.

22-year-old to lead DHS office: Trump picks ex-gardener Thomas Fugate to head prevention team; MAGA ties and little experience in security,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/22-year-old-to-lead-dhs-office-trump-picks-ex-gardener-thomas-fugate-to-head-prevention-team-maga-ties-and-little-experience-in-security/articleshow/121664094.cms,"Thomas Fugate (Image credits: X @justicemalala)





Thomas Fugate, a 22-year-old with a background in gardening and grocery store work, has been appointed by US President Donald Trump to head the center for prevention programs and partnerships (CP3) at the department of homeland Security (DHS).Just five years ago, Fugate was working as a neighborhood gardener. As recently as August 2023, he held a job at a grocery store. A 2023 graduate of the University of Texas at San Antonio, Fugate has experienced a swift rise through Republican political circles.Fugate’s LinkedIn page shows limited experience in the national security or policy field. In 2020, he listed himself as a self-employed “landscape business owner.” He also worked as a “cross functional team member” at an H-E-B supermarket in Austin, Texas.After completing his degree in politics and law, Fugate joined Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign as an “advance team member.” He has also interned at the conservative Heritage foundation and with Texas state representatives Terry Wilson and Steve Allison.In February, he was reportedly hired as a special assistant in an immigration office at DHS.Following the resignation of the previous CP3 director, Fugate was named as the acting head of the center.“Tom Fugate has performed well in his current role as a confidential assistant in our immigration & border security suboffice,” a DHS official told The Daily Beast.“Due to his success, he has been temporarily given additional leadership responsibilities in the center for prevention programs and partnerships office (CP3). This is a credit to his work ethic and success on the job.”Earlier posts from his X account show a different tone, one of interest in global aid, LEGO, Star Wars, and international development. In past tweets, he encouraged Texas lawmakers to support the international affairs budget and aid for the global poor.Fugate later shifted toward a MAGA-aligned political image, rebranding himself with the “thomas4texas” Instagram handle and announcing his entry into public service. His online profiles reflect a carefully constructed persona, including a LinkedIn photo in front of the DHS seal, hinting at confidence and ambition.His rapid promotion has sparked questions about experience and readiness, but DHS officials have stood by the decision, citing his work ethic and current performance.","Thomas Fugate, a 22-year-old with a background in gardening and grocery store work, has been appointed by US President Donald Trump to head the department of homeland Security.

'Necessary to protect our sovereignty': US sanctions four ICC judges for rulings on US and Israel; assets frozen,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/necessary-to-protect-our-sovereignty-us-sanctions-four-icc-judges-for-rulings-on-us-and-israel-assets-frozen/articleshow/121662986.cms,"US secretary of state Marco Rubio (Image credits: AP)





The US would impose new sanctions targeting four judges from the International Criminal Court (ICC), secretary of state Marco Rubio announced in response to investigations into the military actions and arrest warrants issued against Israeli leaders.""The United States will take whatever actions we deem necessary to protect our sovereignty, that of Israel and any other US ally from illegitimate actions by the ICC,"" Rubio said in his statement.He said that the sanctions were a direct response to what he called illegitimate actions by the ICC against both the US and its ally Israel. The four judges named are Solomy Balungi Bossa of Uganda, Luz del Carmen Ibáñez Carranza of Peru, Reine Adelaide Sophie Alapini Gansou of Benin, and Beti Hohler of Slovenia.According to the state department, Judges Bossa and Ibáñez Carranza authorised the ICC’s investigation into US personnel in Afghanistan. Although the investigation was allowed to proceed at the time, it was later dropped. Khan, after taking office in 2021, announced he would not pursue allegations involving US military or CIA personnel.Judges Alapini Gansou and Hohler, meanwhile, were part of the panel that authorised arrest warrants for Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant over actions taken during the war in Gaza.Under the sanctions, all US-based assets belonging to the four judges must be frozen and reported to the treasury department. Americans are also prohibited from conducting business with them. Previous sanctions against ICC officials led to complications in banking and international travel, and some American staff at the court have since resigned.This move follows earlier sanctions imposed in February, when the US penalised ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan for pursuing charges related to Israel’s military campaign in Gaza. The sanctions reportedly disrupted the work of Khan’s team.The US and Israel are not members of the ICC and have long opposed the court’s efforts to investigate their officials or military personnel. During US President Donald Trump 's first presidency, former secretary of state Mike Pompeo imposed similar sanctions when the court moved to investigate alleged war crimes by US troops in Afghanistan.The ICC strongly condemned the new sanctions, calling them ""a clear attempt to undermine"" an institution that seeks to provide justice to victims of severe crimes. In a statement, the court said such measures ""only emboldens those who believe they can act with impunity.""Established in 1998, the ICC is the world’s top criminal court, tasked with prosecuting war crimes, genocide, crimes against humanity, and aggression. The court depends on member states to enforce its rulings, as it has no power to carry them out on its own.The Rome statute, the treaty that created the ICC, has been ratified by 125 countries. However, some of the world’s most powerful nations, including the US, China, Russia, India, and Israel, are not parties to the treaty and do not recognize the court’s authority.""I call on the countries that still support the ICC, many of whose freedom was purchased at the price of great American sacrifices, to fight this disgraceful attack on our nation and Israel,"" he added.","US secretary of state Marco Rubio announced new sanctions against four judges from the International Criminal Court.

Trump-Musk feud: Have all Epstein files been released? What we know so far,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-musk-feud-have-all-epstein-files-been-released-what-we-know-so-far/articleshow/121662578.cms,"Jeffrey Epstein and US President Trump

Have all Epstein files been released

What's next

Who was Jeffrey Epstein?





The long-murky Epstein files returned to the spotlight in early 2024, this time due to a public accusation by Tesla CEO, Elon Musk. In a social media post, Musk claimed that US President Donald Trump was named in documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender. Musk offered no proof, but the statement reignited public interest in the long-secret files.“Epstein files” refer to thousands of documents, videos, and investigative materials gathered over the years in connection with Epstein and his associates. While some court records from his 2008 Florida plea deal and his 2019 federal charges in New York had been made public, many others remained sealed or heavily redacted.In February, US attorney general Pam Bondi, in conjunction with the FBI, declassified and publicly released files related to Epstein’s sexual abuse of more than 250 underage girls at his homes in New York, Florida, and other locations. The first phase of declassified files largely consisted of materials that had previously leaked through unofficial channels but had never been formally released by the US government.The first batch of documents released earlier this year contained mostly previously known information. These included pilot logs from the prosecution of Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s so-called “black book,” and a redacted list of masseuses. The logs had already been public for years and were redacted to conceal the identities of potential victims.One newly revealed document, however, stood out: a three-page “Evidence List” compiled by the justice department, reportedly documenting items recovered during searches of Epstein’s properties in New York and the Virgin Islands. According to the list, investigators seized dozens of recording devices, computers, hard drives, and memory sticks.Also included were a CD labeled “girl pics nude book 4,” a folder marked “LSJ logbook,” believed to refer to Epstein’s private island, and a photo album described as “photo album of girl and Epstein.”Investigators also recovered several massage tables, one of which was presented during Maxwell’s trial, along with a bag containing a set of copper handcuffs and a whip. Another item, a bag holding a yellow envelope marked “SK” dated August 27, 2008, contained multiple smaller envelopes with a total of $17,115 in cash. The date corresponded with the period when Epstein was in jail in Palm Beach, Florida.Still some files are still not out. Many court documents, particularly from Epstein’s 2008 Florida case and the 2019 charges in New York, have been made public, but others remain sealed or redacted.Despite these revelations, the FBI has not confirmed that Trump’s name would appear in the newly released materials. Musk, too, has not clarified which documents he was referring to, and no official source has substantiated his claim.FBI director Kash Patel and deputy director Dan Bongino later confirmed in a Fox News interview that they had reviewed the full file. They maintained that Epstein died by suicide and stated that surveillance footage from his jail cell would be made public in the coming months.The Department of Justice has announced forthcoming releases, potentially including Epstein's jail surveillance footage, though no timeline has been specified. Whilst Bondi maintains that victim protection necessitates the delay, various right-wing commentators and Trump supporters interpret this as deliberate obstruction.Despite widespread demands from different political factions, there are currently no initiatives to make public the complete roster of names linked to Epstein's case documentation.The public's distrust is expected to intensify unless additional documents become available or the DOJ provides a direct response to Musk's allegations.Jeffrey Epstein, whose wealth and business operations remained largely opaque, was known for his connections to a range of powerful figures, including US presidents, British royals, and Hollywood elites. He pleaded guilty in Florida in 2008 to child prostitution charges and served 13 months under a controversial work-release agreement. In 2019, he was arrested again on federal sex trafficking charges for allegedly running a network that exploited underage girls. Weeks later, he was found dead in his Manhattan jail cell. Though his death was officially ruled a suicide, persistent theories have suggested he was murdered to protect powerful individuals implicated in his crimes.Trump, who built much of his political identity on promises to dismantle the “deep state,” had often hinted at exposing hidden government corruption, sometimes alluding to Epstein. As president, he authorised the release of thousands of pages tied to the JFK assassination, but did not do the same with Epstein-related files.Musk and Trump, once aligned politically, are now openly feuding. Their rift began over a new government tax bill, with Musk calling it a “disgusting abomination.” Trump responded on Truth Social, claiming he had excluded Musk from federal EV policy decisions and threatened to revoke subsidies. Musk fired back on X, calling Trump’s claims “an obvious lie” and asserting that Trump’s 2024 campaign would not have succeeded without his support—deepening the divide between the two former allies.","Elon Musk claimed that US President Donald Trump was named in documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender.

Impact on vital research

Political tensions and retaliation claims





Harvard University on Monday asked a federal judge to issue a summary judgment ordering the unfreezing of $2.5 billion in federal research funding that has been halted by the Trump administration, which Harvard says is illegal.The university contends that the freeze jeopardizes over 950 critical research projects, including those related to national security and public health.In a filing with the US district court in Boston, Harvard argues that the funding suspension is both unlawful and politically motivated. The university asserts that the freeze violates its rights to free speech and due process and undermines academic independence.Trump has been attempting to force change at Harvard and other top American universities, because of his view that these have been captured by the left-wing woke and has led to the rise of antisemitism.The Trump administration has not yet responded to this latest move by the university.US district judge Allison Burroughs has set July 21 for the arguments on the Harvard case seeking summary judgement, which refers to a request to the judge to decide a dispute without a trial to determine material facts.The funding freeze affects a wide array of research initiatives, including studies on cancer, infectious diseases, and biological threat awareness for the department of defence. A defence advanced research projects agency (DARPA) official highlighted in court documents that canceling a $12 million grant for biological threat research at Harvard could pose ""grave and immediate harm to national security.""Additionally, the freeze threatens research in areas such as pediatric HIV and dark energy, potentially hindering advancements in both medical and scientific fields.Harvard's legal challenge comes amid escalating tensions with the Trump administration. The university alleges that the funding freeze is a retaliatory measure following its refusal to comply with a list of demands from the White House, which included changes to hiring practices and student discipline regulations.Besides, multiple other investigations have been opened into Harvard, including some looking into threats against Jewish students and faculty after pro-Palestine protests broke out following the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.Further escalating the situation, the administration attempted to revoke Harvard's certification under the student and exchange visitor program, effectively barring the university from enrolling international students. This move was temporarily halted by a federal judge, but it has added to the university's concerns about political interference in academic affairs.","Harvard University has asked a federal judge to order the unfreezing of $2.5 billion in federal research funding halted by the Trump administration.

What is Autopen? Signature device used by Biden to sign pardons; Trump orders inquiry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-autopen-signature-device-used-by-biden-to-sign-pardons-trump-orders-inquiry/articleshow/121638983.cms,"What is Autopen and how does it work?



'Autopen is biggest political scandal in American history': Trump



Trump questions Biden's pardons



Here is a list of the former president's most controversial pardons:

Hunter Biden:

Biden pardons siblings:

Gen. Mark Milley, Dr Anthony Fauci:





The mechanical signature device known as the autopen, which received its first patent many years ago, has recently become a subject of political controversy due to US President Donald Trump 's assertions about Joe Biden 's alleged usage for signing pardons.Trump ordered an investigation Wednesday into whether former President Biden's administration used an autopen machine to sign key presidential documents like pardons.In a memo signed Wednesday night, Trump told Attorney General Pam Bondi and the president's counsel to probe what he claimed was a ""conspiracy"" to ""abuse the power of Presidential signatures through the use of an autopen to conceal Biden's cognitive decline.""An autopen is a mechanical device designed to recreate authentic signatures by physically manipulating a pen. Unlike stamps or digital signature prints, these machines can accommodate various writing instruments, from ballpoint pens to permanent markers, as listed in product specifications for commercially available autopens, Fox News reported.Contemporary autopen systems enable users to store signature patterns on portable devices like smart cards or USB drives for easy transfer to the machine.The signing process begins when a pen is inserted, and the signature is executed by pressing a button or using a foot pedal to activate the mechanism.In March, President Trump contested that if Biden employed an autopen for signing preemptive pardons for House select committee members who investigated the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack, those pardons would be considered ""void"" and ""vacant.""Earlier, President Trump reiterated his concerns on Truth Social, stating ""With the exception of the RIGGED PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 2020, THE AUTOPEN IS THE BIGGEST POLITICAL SCANDAL IN AMERICAN HISTORY!!!""Interestingly, the device was also used to replicate a person’s signature and has been used by past presidents including Thomas Jefferson, John F Kennedy, and Barack Obama to sign ceremonial or routine documents when unavailable.The Heritage Foundation's Oversight Project, a conservative organisation, has also scrutinised this matter, suggesting that Biden's supposed autopen usage, considering his ""clear cognitive decline ... raises additional questions for investigators.""In his concluding weeks as president, Biden extended clemency and pardons to over 1,500 people, which his administration characterised as the most extensive single-day clemency action by any American president. Questioning Biden's mental acuity and decision-making authority, Trump asserted that he was unaware of the documents' contents when using the automated signing device. This raised concerns about his cognitive state during his presidency and his direct involvement in official decisions. administration.While Biden personally signed his son Hunter's pardon, the remaining pardons appear to have been executed using an autopen.In December 2024, former President Joe Biden issued a pardon to his son Hunter, contradicting his earlier promises to the American public. Hunter Biden had been convicted of three felony firearm offences during Special Counsel David Weiss' investigation, alongside federal tax charges for failing to pay over $1.4 million. Prior to his trial, Hunter entered an unexpected guilty plea.On January 19, 2025, just before leaving office, Biden granted clemency to his siblings James, Valerie, and Francis, along with their spouses. The pardons covered potential non-violent offences from January 1, 2014, through to the signing date. The House investigation revealed that Biden family members and associates had received over $27 million from foreign sources since 2014. Additionally, the family allegedly obtained more than $8 million in loans from Democratic supporters during Biden's vice presidency.On January 19, 2025, Biden also pardoned former General Mark Milley, Dr Anthony Fauci, and members of the January 6 House Select Committee. These pardons extended to committee staff and police officers who provided testimony. All pardons appeared to be signed using an autopen.","Autopen is a mechanical device designed to recreate authentic signatures by physically manipulating a pen.
