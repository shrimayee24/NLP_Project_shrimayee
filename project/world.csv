'I don’t support democrats but ...

Sharing one of the memes on her Instagram story, Kangana said she doesn't support democrats but that it is amusing to see a woman politician being subjected to misogynist comments.""Since Biden has endorsed Harris for POTUS…SM is full of such memes…I don’t support democrats but it’s amusing even in America an elderly woman politician who has been attorney general of California has to face sexism to this extend, honestly these Americans think they are so modern and all but they are so regressive worse than Indians to be honest. Shame,” Kangana said in her story.Earlier in this year, Kangana also faced the same kind of mysoginist comments during the Lok Sabha election when Congress leader Supriya Shrinate said purported objectionable remarks about the actor.Social media has been abuzz about Harris as netizens are still sharing the memes especially a coconut one.The meme stems from a random moment in a speech Harris gave in May last year as she was swearing in commissioners for the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity for Hispanics.The old clips resurfaced and were remixed of Harris telling a story in 2023, about her mother saying to her as a child: “You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?”, with Harris adding: “You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you.” It became an instant meme at the time.Clips from that part of the speech have since frequently been shared online, particularly earlier this year on X . Harris, overall, has earned a somewhat goofy reputation online, with many sharing videos of her dancing, her love of venn diagrams, her laughter and her ""coconut tree"" anecdotes.","After Joe Biden withdrew his name from the presidential race and endorsed Kamala Harris, there have been numerous sexist memes against her.

WASHINGTON: US vice-president Kamala Harris said on Sunday that she intends to earn and win the Democratic Party nomination for the Presidency even after endorsement by President Biden and other key figures in the party, amid indications there could be at least one other marginal challenge.""I am honored to have the President’s endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination.I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party—and unite our nation—to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda,"" Harris said in a statement, hours after turbulent developments in the Democratic Party led to President Biden bowing out of the 2024 Presidential election under pressure.Harris' promotion to the top of the ticket also resulted in a surge in political contributions to the Democratic Party, with supporters donating more than $50 million online on Sunday, making it the single biggest day for online Democratic contributions since the 2020 election.Several Democratic veterans and lawmakers, notably Hillary and Bill Clinton, Senator Elizabeth Warren, and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) also backed Harris, with the mainstream in the party appearing to close ranks behind her.But two party grandees, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and former President Barack Obama, did not directly endorse her, although they have been her close allies. It appears they would like her to go through the nomination process and win the support of majority of delegates, which also is the route she prefers.Barack Obama conspicuously withheld endorsing Harris, instead alluding to the possibility of an open convention. He expressed confidence in Democratic leaders’ ability to “create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges.”One direct challenge to her prospective candidacy came from a previous aspirant, author Marianne Williamson, who declared that ""nomination of a new Democratic candidate must be opened to a genuinely democratic process at an open convention.""""No one should simply be anointed to the position of nominee; all candidates must be heard and their agendas explored. Our party’s basic first principle is democracy. We cannot save our democracy without practicing it ourselves,"" she said in a statement.Another potential opposition from Senator Joe Manchin from West Virginia, who decamped from the Democratic side to become independent following differences with the party leadership, but was said to be considering returning to the fold to mount a challenge for the nomination, died on his own accord.Ardent Biden supports from Black and Hispanic caucus such as Congressman Jim Clyburn and Ocasio-Cortez, who had said they would support Harris if and when Biden drops out , are keeping their word.""Kamala Harris will be the next President of the United States.

While some hailed him as a hero for free speech, others considered him a villain for potentially endangering US security and intelligence sources. The released material included a video showing civilians being killed by fire from a US helicopter gunship in Iraq in 2007.In a plea deal, Assange pled guilty in a US Pacific island court to a single count of revealing military secrets. He was sentenced to time already served and allowed to walk free.

The announcement comes after a devastating result reduced the party to just 121 MPs, marking its worst-ever performance. The centre-left Labour opposition secured a commanding 174-seat majority.The new leader will assume the role of official opposition leader in Parliament and engage in debates with the newly appointed Prime Minister Keir Starmer, including the crucial weekly “Prime Minister's questions.”Although no candidates have officially declared their intentions, several names have been floated as potential successors to Sunak. These include former trade minister Kemi Badenoch, hardline ex-interior minister Suella Braverman, Britain’s former top diplomat James Cleverly, and ex-immigration minister Robert Jenrick.The party’s 1922 Committee, responsible for internal organisation, has established the race’s rules. Candidates may submit their bids until 29 July. The 121 Conservative MPs will then vote twice to narrow the field to two finalists. Party members will decide the winner in an online vote in October, with the final result announced on 2 November.Sunak will remain as Tory leader until his successor is chosen. The internal divisions that contributed to the Conservatives' downfall are expected to surface further, particularly following the rise of the far-right Reform UK party , which attracted many traditional Conservative voters in the 4 July election.1922 Committee Chairman Bob Blackman highlighted the importance of a respectful and thorough leadership debate. “We must remember that the country -- and our members -- want to see us engaged in proper debate not personal attacks,” he said.Sunak said it was in the ""national interest"" for the party to have a ""smooth and orderly transition to a new leader of the opposition"". ""This will allow our party to fulfill its role as the official opposition professionally and effectively. I believe this is what is best for the Conservative Party and, most importantly, our country"", he said.","The new leader will assume the role of official opposition leader in Parliament.

Americans face deluge of trash talk and conspiracy theories in election season,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/americans-face-deluge-of-trash-talk-and-conspiracy-theories-in-election-season/articleshow/111942329.cms,"WASHINGTON: A tsunami of trash talk and conspiracy theories is raining down on Americans as MAGA maniacs and radical left loonies are duking it out on social media over their respective leaders' character and merit. The exit of Prez Joe Biden from the 2024 race for the White House and the promotion of Kamala Harris as the prospective Democratic nominee has unleashed a furious assault on everything from her character to her mannerisms.Trump himself has led the way, gibing about the way she laughs and calling her crazy.""I call her laughing Kamala. You can tell a lot by a laugh. She's crazy. She's nuts,"" Trump told a rally in Michigan in a meandering speech that led liberal trolls to joke that bats in the animal kingdom were going ""Trump-shit crazy"" (a play on the expression ""batshit crazy"").MAGA activists backed up Trump's jibe by posting an edited mash-up of Harris laughing on different occasions in different settings, and worse, impugning her character by talking up a purported affair she had some 30 years ago.Conspiracy theories are also proliferating by the minute. They range from Biden's statement on quitting the race not being on an official letterhead and the signature on it not matching his usual signature (and therefore suspicious), to the familiar birther theory about Harris being born outside the US or being an offspring of foreign student, and therefore not eligible to run for White House.Activists on both sides also duked it out on her identity - on whether she is African-American or Indian-American, and which heritage she embraces or avoids. Harris is Jamaican-American (from her dad's side) and Indian-American (from her mom's side), and therefore she's black-brown, not strictly African-American in the conventional sense.She often identifies herself as black but also embraces Indian heritage from her maternal side, growing up closer to her mother, who brought her up as a single mom after her parents divorced when she was six. Trolls also feasted on edited mash-ups of Harris' ""rambling word salad"", with one right-wing outlet suggesting it ""may be a symptom of a little-known but common psychological condition called logorrhoea - also known as verbal diarrhoea"".To be fair, liberal trolls have confected similar mash-ups of Trump (who suffers even more from a similar condition), including parodying his scowls, jowls, and other facial contortions. AI tools are further helping wreak havoc.","The exit of Joe Biden from the 2024 race for the White House has unleashed a furious assault on everything from her character to her mannerisms.

However, while the former president commended Biden's action as a testament for the ""love of the country,"" he also stopped short of fully rooting and endorsing vice president Kamala Harris hinting that the democratic party will be ""navigating uncharted waters in the days ahead.""""Joe Biden has been one of America's most consequential presidents, as well as a dear friend and partner to me,"" the statement released Sunday said, adding that Biden helped the country from ""four years of chaos, falsehood, and division that had characterized Donald Trump's administration.""""I also know Joe has never backed down from a fight.For him to look at the political landscape and decide that he should pass the torch to a new nominee is surely one of the toughest in his life. But I know he wouldn't make this decision unless he believed it was right for America. It's a testament to Joe Biden's love of country — and a historic example of a genuine public servant once again putting the interests of the American people ahead of his own that future generations of leaders will do well to follow,"" he added.Obama added that he was extraordinarily confident that leaders of the Democratic party will be able to create a process from which an ""outstanding nominee emerges"" while also holding that the democratic party has to ""navigate uncharted waters in the days ahead"".""And I expect that every single one of us are prepared to carry that message of hope and progress forward into November and beyond.""Obama has campaigned with his former vice president a couple times this year, but has publicly silent about the calls for President Biden to withdraw from the race, which came amid reporting from several news outlets that Obama was expressing concern behind the scenes about his chances of winning in November.Interestingly, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi who has also commended Biden but stopped short of endorsing Kamala , recently was reported as informing her colleagues in the California delegation that if President Biden were to end his campaign, she would push for a “competitive” open primary process, ruling out vice president Kamala Harris as an automatic replacement.However, most senior democrats have endorsed Kamala Harris after Biden made the call to step aside. The move stems from concerns about the prospects of a new candidate inheriting the already available campaign funding crucial for the election, which makes Kamala Harris a favorite for now.","Barrack Obama said Joe Biden's decision to step down from the presidential race was a testament to the ""love of the country"" However, Obama stopped short of fully rooting and endorsing vice president Kamala Harris hinting that the democratic party will be ""navigating uncharted waters in the days ahead""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111913231,imgsize-46412,width-400,resizemode-4/111913231.jpg"

Trump denounced extremist label

'Stupid' Biden

Praise for autocrats

Tough stance on 'illegal' immigration

Donald Trump held a campaign rally on Sunday, his first since narrowly escaping an assassination attempt last week. He mocked Democrats and compared former Democratic house speaker Nancy Pelosi to a ""dog,"" while also attacking President Joe Biden and repeating false claims about various issues.Here are five key takeaways from his speech in rally:The recently held Republican National Convention saw Trump downplaying false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him.However, during his return to the campaign trail on Sunday night, Trump did not hold back.""The Radical Left Democrats rigged the presidential election in 2020 and we're not going to allow them to rig the presidential election in 2024,"" he declared, making another reference to voter fraud .""We want a landslide that is too big to rig,"" he added later.Trump urged early voters to ""follow your vote"" and claimed that in 2020, some states were ""shoveling ballots into wheelbarrows, moving them around.""The crowd cheered as he called on them to ""Fight, fight, fight.""Trump reiterated his disapproval of Project 2025 , a manifesto opponents describe as an authoritarian, right-wing agenda.""The other side is going around trying to make me sound extreme ... I'm not an extremist at all,"" he complained.He described the Heritage Foundation 's blueprint to reshape the federal government as the work of ""the radical right... they're seriously extreme,"" claiming, ""I don't know what the hell it is.""Trump said that the notion of him being a ""threat to democracy"" is ""misinformation.""""Last week, I took a bullet for democracy,"" he said.Trump criticized Biden's candidacy, highlighting concerns within the Democratic Party about Biden's age, as some believe that at 81, he is too old to serve another term.""They have no idea who their candidate is ... Sort of interesting, this guy goes and he gets the votes and now they want to take it away. That's democracy,"" Trump said in Michigan.He claimed that former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had turned on Biden ""like a dog.""Trump called Biden ""stupid"" and ""a low-IQ individual,"" and also criticized Vice President Kamala Harris—who could succeed Biden if he steps aside—as ""crazy.""Trump highlighted his relationships with global autocrats, claiming that his rapport with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un made the United States safer.""All he wants to do is buy nuclear weapons and make them,"" he said of Kim. ""I said, just relax, chill. You've got enough. You got, you got so much nuclear weapons, so much, I said, just relax... let's go to a baseball game.""Trump praised Hungarian President Viktor Orban as a ""very powerful leader"" and asserted that, had he (Trump) been the US leader, Russian President Vladimir Putin would never have invaded Ukraine in 2022.He mentioned receiving a ""beautiful note"" from Chinese President Xi Jinping after the assassination attempt, calling Xi a ""great guy.""Trump told reporters that Xi is ""a brilliant man. He controls 1.4 billion people with an iron fist.""Trump issued numerous threats against illegal migrants, describing an ""invasion"" at the US border and suggesting that Democrats were allowing it to secure votes.Trump said that if he returns to office, he'll launch the ""largest deportation operation in the history of our country.""""When I return to the White House, we will stop the plunder, rape, slaughter, and destruction of our American suburb cities,"" he declared.""We're going to get the bad ones out. We're going to get them out immediately. It's not going to take long.""He vowed to ""crush migrant crime"" and accused countries like Venezuela of ""dumping their criminals into the United States of America,"" asserting that ""we're not going to take it anymore.""(With agency inputs)","Donald Trump held a campaign rally on Sunday, his first since narrowly escaping an assassination attempt last week.

Kamala Harris gets muted response in India as few see change in US ties,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-harris-gets-muted-response-in-india-as-few-see-change-in-us-ties/articleshow/111943467.cms,"Four years ago, when Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris as his running mate, much of India was abuzz over how the first Indian-American in the White House might affect the future of US-India relations .Now, Harris is a step closer to capturing the Democratic nomination for president — but few are expecting any change in ties should she win.Despite Harris’ well-documented Indian heritage and family links to the country there is little indication that her presidency would meaningfully tip the direction of the US-India relationship, which has strengthened in recent decades under both Republican and Democratic administrations.The US has sought to cultivate a deeper partnership with India as a bulwark against a more assertive China, while India has sought greater US investment and deeper cooperation in technology sharing and defense. The economic and strategic logic that underpins US-India ties would likely remain intact were Harris to win the White House, analysts and Indian officials said.“There would be a degree of continuity if she’s elected to the White House,” said Harsh Pant of the Observer Research Foundation, a New Delhi think tank. “India has had a productive relationship with Mr Biden. And Kamala Harris was part of the administration.”In 2020, Biden’s choice of Harris as his running mate sparked a wave of excitement in India, with social media users poring over her family connections to Chennai, the southern Indian city where her mother was born. Undated photos surfaced of a younger Harris and her sister Maya in saris, posing with grandparents during a visit.Harris at the time was the first Black woman and the first woman of Indian descent on a major ticket in a US presidential election. Her joining the ticket sparked reports in Indian media over how a Biden-Harris win might further bolster ties between the two countries.Ties have indeed continued to improve, but India has not been a personal priority for Harris, who has instead been occupied with domestic issues, like reproductive rights and securing the US-Mexico border. Harris hosted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the White House last year, where she talked about her Indian heritage and praised Modi’s leadership. But she hasn’t visited India during her time as vice president.While on the campaign trail in 2019, Harris criticized Modi’s policies on Kashmir, a region contested by both India and Pakistan and was the site of a lengthy crackdown after Modi scrapped the Muslim-majority state’s autonomy. “We have to remind Kashmiris that they are not alone in the world,” she said in September of that year.One reason Harris’s Indian ties may not be much of a political factor is that they aren’t a prominent part in her public persona, said Sreeram Sundar Chaulia, dean of the Jindal School of International Affairs. “Unlike say Rishi Sunak in the UK, for example, who has been very open about showing his Indian and Hindu roots,” he said. Sunak was Britain’s prime minister until earlier this month.Instead, Harris’s African and Carribean heritage — her father is from Jamaica — is the more visible part of her public identity, Chaulia said.Modi, meanwhile, is widely believed to enjoy warmer and more personal ties with Donald Trump, who is the Republican’s candidate for president. Both leaders have hosted each other at political rallies in their respective countries, with Trump holding a “Howdy Modi” event in Houston before a huge crowd of Indian Americans in September 2019 — just days after Modi’s new policy in Kashmir.That event was followed up in 2020 with a visit by Trump to Modi’s home state of Gujarat for an event billed “Namaste Trump.” There, the US president addressed a rally of nearly 100,000 people at a stadium in the city of Ahmedabad.Irrespective of who wins November’s election, US-India ties should maintain their upward trajectory — despite having been tested in the last year. Allegations of India’s involvement in a murder-for-hire plot against a Sikh activist on US soil, as well as Modi’s embrace of Russian President Vladimir Putin, have both been an irritant for the US.“The relationship between the United States and India goes beyond individuals, and even beyond parties,” said Sushant Singh, a lecturer at Yale University. “All administrations, starting from President Bill Clinton, have advocated closer ties with India and that is not going to change, especially when the China factor looms large in both national capitals.”Still, in Tamil Nadu — the home state of Harris’ Indian family — pride in the prospect of an Indian-American in the White House runs high. B Krishna Moorthy, who runs the Commissionerate of Rehabilitation and Welfare of Non Resident Tamils, said the group was “deeply moved and filled with pride” at the prospect of a Harris presidency.“We look forward to seeing how her experiences and perspectives will contribute positively to global discourse, inspire future generations and foster the Indo-US relationship.”",Kamala Harris is a step closer to capturing the Democratic nomination for president. But few are expecting any change in ties should she win. The economic and strategic logic that underpins US-India ties would likely remain intact.

'Full of sh*t': Lawmakers call on secret service director Kimberly Cheatle to resign over Trump assassination attempt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/full-of-sht-lawmakers-call-on-secret-service-director-kimberly-cheatle-to-resign-over-trump-assassination-attempt/articleshow/111942877.cms,"US secret service director Kimberly Cheatle dismissed calls from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers to resign following security lapses that led to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump being wounded by a would-be assassin. Lawmakers also criticised Cheatle for not providing sufficient details about the incident.The calls for Cheatle’s resignation came from James Comer, the Republican chair of the US House of Representatives Oversight Committee and Jamie Raskin, the committee's top Democrat.Comer and Raskin seldom agree on issues, but both expressed their disappointment regarding Cheatle's leadership.""This committee is not known for its model of bipartisanship, and I think today we came together unanimously in our disappointment,"" Comer stated. ""We don't have that confidence that you can lead.""Raskin echoed the sentiment, saying, ""Cheatle had lost the confidence of Congress at a very urgent and tender moment in the history of the country, and we very quickly need to move beyond this.""During the hearing, which lasted more than four and a half hours, Cheatle described the July 13 shooting at an outdoor campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, as 'the most significant operational failure at the secret service in decades.' She compared the incident to the 1981 attempted assassination of former President Ronald Reagan.Despite this acknowledgment, Cheatle resisted pressure to step down. ""I think that I am the best person to lead the secret service at this time,"" she insisted.This session was the first round of congressional oversight regarding the attempted assassination, where Trump was injured in the ear. One rally attendee was killed and another injured. The suspected shooter, 20-year-old nursing home aide Thomas Crooks, was killed by law enforcement. His motive remains unclear.FBI Director Christopher Wray is set to testify before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday. House Speaker Mike Johnson plans to announce a bipartisan task force to coordinate House investigations.In defending the agency, Cheatle refuted Republican claims that the secret service denied resources to protect Trump. She stated that security had already been heightened for Trump ahead of the shooting. ""The level of security provided for the former president increased well before the campaign and has been steadily increasing as threats evolve,"" she commented.Cheatle also mentioned that the secret service met the security requests of the Trump campaign for the rally. However, she repeatedly chose not to answer specific questions from both Republicans and Democrats, leaving them openly frustrated.""Tell us what went wrong,"" pleaded Republican Representative Pete Sessions. ""Tell us, and don't try and play a shell game with us.""Cheatle responded that she wanted to provide accurate information but cited ongoing investigations, including an internal probe set to conclude within 60 days as the reason for withholding details.But Cheatle became more vague when the Republican congressman Jim Jordan pressed her on whether the secret service had denied past requests for additional security at Trump campaign events. “It looks like you won’t answer some pretty basic questions,” Jordan said. “And you cut corners when it came to protecting one of the most important individuals, one of the most well-known individuals on the planet.”Some Republicans representatives grew openly combative as they questioned Cheatle, with Nancy Mace telling the director: “You’re full of shit today.”Lawmakers from both parties dismissed the idea of waiting 60 days for a report, accusing Cheatle of obstructing Congress. Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez critiqued, ""The notion of a report coming out in 60 days when the threat environment is so high in the United States, irrespective of party, is not acceptable.""The incident has sparked significant concern about the Secret Service's capabilities and transparency, leading to a rare moment of bipartisan unity in Congress demanding accountability and swift action.",US secret service director Kimberly Cheatle dismissed calls from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers to resign following security lapses that led to Donald Trump being wounded by a would-be assassin.

At that time, Fox News disclosed the details about the $5,000 donation.According to court documents, Trump made the donation at the request of New York’s then top prosecutor, Eric Schneiderman , who held a fundraiser for Harris in September 2011. Trump was persuaded to buy a $5,000 ticket for the event, which Ivanka attended.Trump insisted that this favor for Schneiderman, later disgraced after accusations of physical abuse by several women, had no connection to the investigation into Trump University that was ongoing at the time.Contrary to Steele’s quip on social media, Harris will not be able to use the $5,000 for her 2024 presidential campaign, should she secure the Democratic nomination. As reported by the Sacramento Bee in 2020, she donated the entire $6,000 from Trump to a civil rights non-profit working in Central America as she began her run for the US Senate.","The $5,000 cheque dated September 26, 2011, signed by Trump and made payable to “Attorney General Kamala D Harris’s re-election committee’ resurfaced on social media.

Several homes were destroyed on Monday as wildfires swept through a Southern California neighborhood amid a severe heat wave. Three homes in Riverside, about 60 miles east of Los Angeles, were ravaged by a fire that erupted on Sunday afternoon. Riverside Deputy Fire Chief Steve McKinster reported that four other structures were damaged. The fire, which burned nearly a square mile, is still under investigation.Large wildfires can create towering plumes of smoke and ash, which can rise over 5 miles depending on conditions.These columns can collapse, reducing the updraft and spreading fire in multiple directions. Some fires experience repeated cycles of column collapse and regeneration daily.In the Pacific Northwest and Idaho, more than two dozen fires are burning. Lightning sparked additional blazes in Oregon over the weekend amid extremely dry and hot conditions. The largest fires are in rural areas of eastern Oregon and Washington, affecting air quality with smoke.Authorities evacuated Huntington, Oregon, a town of about 500 people, and closed part of Interstate 84 late Sunday after thunderstorms caused a massive smoke column to collapse. The implosion generated 50 mph winds, raising fears the fire would jump the highway. By Monday, I-84 had reopened and the town was safe, butevacuation orders remained due to expected extreme fire behavior. This fire covers over 272 square miles and is not yet contained.Another fast-moving fire started Monday afternoon in Oregon's Columbia River Gorge, where a wind advisory was in place for gusts up to 50 mph. The Wasco County Sheriff's Office issued mandatory evacuations near Mosier, advising the town's residents to be ready to evacuate.Riverside experienced a high of 102 degrees on Sunday, part of a heat wave affecting much of California's interior and expected to last through the week. Numerous other fires are burning throughout the state, including a fire that began Saturday and quickly grew to over 4 square miles on the border of Lake and Colusa counties, northwest of Sacramento. This fire was 25% contained by Monday.In Utah, authorities lifted evacuation orders for a wildfire near the state Capitol in Salt Lake City, which began Saturday and grew to about 200 acres. While the evacuation order was lifted late Sunday, residents were advised to stay prepared as the fire was only partially under control by Monday morning.","Three homes in Riverside, about 60 miles east of Los Angeles, were ravaged by a fire that erupted on Sunday afternoon.

Biden had originally planned to speak at the event, but remained in Delaware recovering from Covid. Harris subbing in for Biden offered a well-timed glimpse of what she could be like in the job of prez should she win in Nov.Several Democratic veterans and lawmakers, notably Hillary and Bill Clinton, senator Elizabeth Warren and congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) also backed Harris, with the mainstream in the party appearing to close ranks behind her. But two party grandees, former House speaker Nancy Pelosi and former president Barack Obama, did not directly endorse her, although they have been her close allies.It appears they would like her to go through the nomination process and win the support of majority of delegates, which also is the route she prefers. Obama conspicuously withheld endorsing Harris, instead alluding to the possibility of an open convention. He expressed confidence in Democratic leaders' ability to ""create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges"".One direct challenge to her prospective candidacy came from a previous aspirant, author Marianne Williamson, who declared that ""nomination of a new candidate must be opened to a genuinely democratic process at an open convention"". ""No one should simply be anointed to the position of nominee; all candidates must be heard and their agendas explored. Our party's basic first principle is democracy. We cannot save our democracy without practicing it ourselves."" she said.Another potential opposition from Senator Joe Manchin, who decamped from the Democratic side to become independent following differences with the party leadership, but was said to be considering returning to the fold to mount a challenge for the nomination, died on his own accord. ""I am not going to be a candidate,"" he said, adding that he favoured the idea of a ""mini-primary"".Biden supporters from black and Hispanic caucus such as Congressman Jim Clyburn and AOC, who had said they would support Harris if and when Biden drops out, are keeping their word. ""I pledge my full support to ensure her victory in Nov. Now more than ever, it is crucial that our party and country swiftly unite to defeat Donald Trump,"" she posted on X.","US vice-president Kamala Harris said on Sunday that she intends to earn and win the Democratic Party nomination for the presidency.

The army said the party information secretary was in charge of PTI ’s digital media cell which, it alleged, was involved in running anti-state propaganda.Last month PM Shehbaz Sharif had approved a military offensive to counter aspikein terrorist attacks across Pakistan, particularly in volatile northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and southwestern Balochistan provinces, but the idea was widely criticised by opposition parties, particularly PTI and the rights group Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM). They termed it a ploy against Pashtuns to earn dollars from major powers and exploit their resources.Addressing a presser in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, the military’s spokesperson, Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, asked, “Why did a mafia, a political mafia , and an illegal mafia say that they would not let this campaign (OperationAzm-e-Istehkam, or Resolve for Stability) happen?” He added that opponents of the offensive had tried to make it “controversial” and paint it as a purely military operation in which thousands of people would be displaced.He did not name any party or group butcalled the army’s critics “politicalandillegal mafias”,an apparent reference to PTI and PTM.Lt Gen Chaudhry said they were using “fake news and propaganda” to spread lies about the army and its intentions.“This is digital terrorism,” he said. “The physical terrorist also attacks law enforcement agencies and the army, and the digital terrorist also attacks the army. They are doing the same thing.”“Digital terrorists”, the spokesman said, would be deterred through laws, regulation and monitoring.He, however, questioned the lack of action against such individuals despite their activities against the leadership of the state and other institutions. “Instead of the courts and regulations moving forward against them, they’re given further space and they’re made heroes in the name of freedom of expression,” he said.Ahead of Sharif’s press conference, security forces had raided PTI’s offices and arrested Raoof Hasan from the party’s central secretariat. The raid came a week after the govt had said it planned to ban the party.“The PTI digital media centre had become a centre of international disinformation, from where anti-Pakistan propaganda is run throughout the world,” Islamabad police said, adding that those directly involved in anti-national propaganda were arrested and all evidence from PTI’s digital media cell wasconfiscated.The party issued a statement on X, saying: “It’s absolutely shameful how Islamabad police continues to completely mock and disregard every law in this country. Law of the jungle is reigning over Pakistan!”The crackdown on PTI follows several court rulings in its favour this month that threaten PM Sharif’s govt, which came to power in Feb this year with the military’s backing.","Pakistan army accuses its criticsof “politicising” its anti-terrorism efforts.

The Pakistan army on Monday accused an "" illegal political mafia "" of trying to sabotage its renewed military operation, codenamed "" Azm-i-Istehkam "" (Resolve for Stability), against rising terrorism in the country.Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) director general Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif, in a press conference in Rawalpindi, stated that a ""massive, illegal political mafia"" has risen to undermine the operation due to ""vested interests"".Sharif clarified that Azm-i-Istehkam is not just a military operation but a comprehensive counter-terrorism campaign launched through national consensus to reinvigorate the already in-place National Action Plan (NAP).He stressed that the purpose of the operation is to eliminate terrorism, which will eventually lead to ""societal and national uplift"".However, the DG ISPR accused a ""very strong lobby"" of having a vested interest in sabotaging the operation, as it does not want the NAP to succeed.He alleged that this entity is receiving a lot of money to subvert the operation.""The stakes in [sabotaging] this operation are very high, and it's not based on any ideology but involves a lot of money,"" he said.Lt Gen Sharif stated that the ""illegal political mafia"" made the first move to make the operations controversial through false and fake arguments.He pointed out that the problem lies in the implementation of the NAP's other points, such as the regularisation and registration of religious seminaries, where only a bit over 16,000 out of about 32,000 seminaries have been registered so far. He questioned whether the army should be responsible for these tasks.The DG ISPR also mentioned the issue of the ""illegal spectrum"", which hides a major illegal economy through which the criminal system and terrorism operate. He said the requirement of the illegal spectrum is a ""soft state"" and the solution to it is the National Action Plan.While the DG ISPR's statements highlight the challenges faced by the government in implementing its counter-terrorism strategy, it is essential to note that the army's involvement in political matters can be a sensitive issue.The military has historically played a significant role in the country's politics, and its direct intervention in political affairs has often been a subject of controversy.It remains to be seen whether the army will take a more active role in the country's affairs in response to the alleged sabotage of the counter-terrorism campaign by the ""illegal political mafia"".","Pakistan army accuses an ""illegal political mafia "" of trying to sabotage its renewed military operation.

The remaining 2% will be set aside for members of ethnic minorities and transgender and disabled people.Law minister Anisul Haq of the ruling Awami League party welcomed the SC decision and said it ""well thought of"".The protests turned deadly on Tuesday, a day after students at Dhaka University began clashing with police.Violence continued to escalate as police fired tear gas and rubber bullets and hurled smoke grenades to scatter stone-throwing protesters.Bangladeshi authorities haven't shared any official numbers of those killed and injured, but at least four local newspapers on Sunday reported that over 100 people have been killed.As the situation appears to head towards normalcy, the Bangladesh police have arrested more than 500 people, including some opposition leaders, over days of clashes in the capital Dhaka.""At least 532 people have been arrested over the violence,"" Dhaka Metropolitan Police spokesman Faruk Hossain told AFP.""They include some BNP leaders,"" he added, referring to the opposition Bangladesh National Party.","A Bangladeshi student leader on Monday called for a 48-hour halt to the protest against the Sheikh Hasina-led government's quota decision.

Controversy & criticism

More than 500 people, including opposition leaders, were arrested on Monday in Dhaka amid violent clashes that have left 163 dead.The clash began over politicised quotas in government job admissions protests against civil service hiring rules but quickly escalated into one of the most severe crises under Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina 's administration.They have since evolved into widespread unrest , inciting the government to impose a curfew and deploy soldiers across the country. An internet blackout, in effect since Thursday, has severely limited information flow.Dhaka metropolitan police spokesman Faruk Hossain confirmed the arrest of at least 532 people, including leaders from the opposition Bangladesh national party (BNP).The unrest was further ignited by supreme court decision to reduce hiring quotas for government jobs, which are highly valued. While the court's ruling decreased the quota from 56% to 7%, it did not satisfy student leaders, whose protests have resulted in deadly confrontations.Ali Riaz, a political expert from Illinois state university, described the violence as ""the worst massacre by any regime since independence,"" criticising the government's reliance on force.Diplomatic tensions have also arisen, with US Ambassador Peter Haas, challenging the Bangladeshi foreign minister's narrative of the events. At a briefing, foreign minister, Hasan Mahmud showed diplomats footage highlighting damage caused by protesters, but Haas pointed out the absence of police violence in the presentation.Protests continue despite the government's efforts to quell them, with the Students Against Discrimination group vowing to persist until their demands are met.The government's handling of the crisis, particularly the use of force and the arrest of opposition figures, has drawn significant criticism. Among those detained are high profile BNP leaders and members of the Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami.The quota system, particularly the ""freedom fighter"" category, has long been debatable. Critics argue that it favours supporters of the ruling Awami League, amplifying frustration among job seeking graduates in a country where youth unemployment is a critical issue.Prime Minister Hasina's administration, in power since 2009, faces allegations of using state institutions to maintain its grip on power and suppress dissent. The government's response to the protests, including extrajudicial actions against opposition activists, has been widely condemned by rights groups.","Clash began over politicised quotas in government job admissions protests.

Diplomats confront Bangladesh foreign minister over violence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/diplomats-confront-bangladesh-foreign-minister-over-violence/articleshow/111920515.cms,"DHAKA: Diplomats in Dhaka questioned Bangladeshi authorities' deadly response to widespread student protests following a presentation by the foreign minister that laid the blame for recent violence at demonstrators' feet, diplomatic officials said Monday.What began as a movement against politicised admission quotas for sought-after government jobs has snowballed into some of the worst unrest of prime minister Sheikh Hasina 's tenure, with at least 163 people killed in clashes so far, according to an AFP count of victims reported by police and hospitals.Foreign minister Hasan Mahmud summoned ambassadors for a briefing Sunday and showed them a 15-minute video that sources said focused on damage caused by protesters.But a senior diplomatic official in Dhaka, speaking on condition of anonymity, told AFP on Monday that US ambassador Peter Haas said Mahmud was presenting a one-sided version of events.""I am surprised you did not show the footage of police firing at unarmed protesters,"" the source quoted Haas as telling the minister.The source added that Mahmud also did not respond to a question from a United Nations representative about the alleged use of UN-marked armoured personnel carriers and helicopters -- which the country has in its military inventories -- to suppress the protests.The meeting came afterBangladesh 's top court pared back the hiring quotas for highly desirable government jobs that have been at the centre of the protests.The decision curtailed the number of reserved jobs from 56 per cent of all positions to 7 per cent, most of which will still be set aside for the children and grandchildren of ""freedom fighters"" from Bangladesh's 1971 liberation war against Pakistan.While the decision represented a substantial reduction to the contentious ""freedom fighter"" category, it fell short of protesters' demands to scrap it altogether.Critics say the quota has been used to stack public jobs with loyalists to Hasina's ruling Awami League.A spokesman for Students Against Discrimination , the main group organising the demonstrations, told AFP: ""We won't call off our protests until the government issues an order reflecting our demands.""Hasina, 76, has ruled the country since 2009 and won her fourth consecutive election in January after a vote without genuine opposition.Since the crackdown on protests began, some demonstrators have said they will not be satisfied until Hasina's government steps down.",Foreign minister Hasan Mahmud summoned ambassadors for a briefing Sunday. He showed them a 15-minute video that sources said focused on damage caused by protesters. US ambassador Peter Haas said Mahmud was presenting a one-sided version of events.
