NEW DELHI: Jammu and Kashmir have been grappling with continuous rainfall that has wreaked havoc in several regions including higher reaches. Torrential rains in the valley have triggered flash floods in parts of Kupwara in northern Kashmir causing damages to buildings and roads. Moreover, the Sarbal area of Sonamarg in central Kashmir's Ganderbal district bore the brunt of an avalanche that hit on Monday.Natural calamities compelled authorities to carry out rescue operations in affected areas. Schools in Kupwara were ordered closure amid heavy rains. Here are the top developments of the day:As heavy rain triggered a flood-like situation in areas of North Kashmir's Kupwara district, Jammu and Kashmir Police carried out rescue operations in flood-affected areas.The officials reported that the Jammu-Srinagar national highway, which is the sole all-weather route connecting Kashmir with the rest of India, was shut down on Monday due to several landslides caused by heavy rainfall that affected large areas of Jammu and Kashmir during the night. The highway was blocked by landslides at Mehar, Gangroo, Mom Passi and Kishtwari Pather in Ramban district.The ongoing rainfall is hindering the efforts to clear the debris and restore the highway, according to the officials. They advised travelers to refrain from using the highway until the debris is completely removed.Furthermore, the Mughal road, which serves as an alternative route connecting the Poonch and Rajouri districts in Jammu with the Shopian district in south Kashmir, has been closed for the past three days due to snowfall in Peer Ki Gali and the surrounding areas, as reported by the officials.Amid torrential rains in other parts of the valley, an avalanche hit the Sarbal area of Sonamarg, located in the Ganderbal district of central Kashmir today. No casualties or financial losses were reported, as the avalanche occurred on the forest side of the region, causing no damage, according to officials.Visuals show Project Beacon, a division of the Border Roads Organisation (BRO), engaged in a snow-clearing operation at the affected site.In a separate incident the previous day, a team from the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) successfully rescued a total of 35 vehicles that were trapped in snow at Razdan Top, situated on the Bandipora-Gurez road in Jammu and Kashmir. BRO officials said that the vehicles were stranded due to adverse weather conditions, which included snowfall and snowstorms.Classes in schools across Kupwara were suspended today due to heavy rainfall. The decision was made by authorities as a precautionary measure to ensure the safety of students.An official said, ""In view of inclement weather and an avalanche warning issued by the Jammu and Kashmir State Disaster Management Authority (JKSDMA), class work in all schools across the district is suspended on April 29 as a precautionary measure for the safety of students.""Despite the suspension of classes, teaching and non-teaching staff were instructed to attend to their duties to monitor the situation and safeguard the assets of their respective schools.In response to the persistent rainfall, officials in Kishtwar temporarily shut down educational institutions throughout the district. The decision to halt classes for the day was made with the primary goal of ensuring the protection and welfare of students and faculty members.According to an official around 8-10 houses were damaged due to heavy rain in Mandi Area of Poonch. SDM Ashfaq Hussain said, ""8-10 houses were damaged in heavy rainfall. Some houses are fully damaged and some are partially damaged. A few roads have also been damaged. A relief amount will be given to the affected as per the rules. We are providing tents to the affected families. We have identified vulnerable spots and places of alternate accommodation in the area.""Continuous rainfall over the past two days has caused water levels in various water bodies throughout Kashmir to increase. Officials have issued a danger warning specifically for Pohru Nallah in Kupwara due to the rising water levels.However, the water level in other water bodies, including the Jhelum river, is still below the alert mark. Authorities are closely monitoring the situation to ensure the safety of the residents in the affected areas.India Meteorological Department today issued an orange alert for Jammu and Kashmir predicting heavy rains (64.5-115.5 mm). The weather department also predicted isolated hailstorms, thunderstorms and lightning with gusty winds (40-50 kmph) over neighbouring states including Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand on April 29.","Torrential rains in the valley have triggered flash floods in parts of Kupwara in northern Kashmir.

RAW official was involved in assassination plot of Sikh separatist leader Gurpatwant Singh Pannun: Media report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/raw-official-was-involved-in-assassination-plot-of-sikh-separatist-leader-gurpatwant-singh-pannun-media-report/articleshow/109699864.cms,"WASHINGTON: A RAW official identified as Vikram Yadav was involved in the assassination plot of Sikh separatist leader Gurpatwant Singh Pannun in the US and the move was approved by the then Indian spy agency chief Samant Goel, according to an investigative media report published on Monday. Pannun is one of the main leaders of the Khalistan movement and the legal advisor and spokesperson for Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), which aims to promote the idea of a separate Sikh state.The Indian government has declared Pannun a terrorist.In an investigative report, The Washington Post newspaper said, ""That India would pursue lethal operations in North America has stunned Western security officials.""""Yadav's identity and affiliation, which have not previously been reported, provide the most explicit evidence to date that the assassination plan - ultimately thwarted by US authorities - was directed from within the Indian spy service,"" the daily reported.""Higher-ranking (Research and Analysis Wing) RAW officials have also been implicated, according to current and former Western security officials, as part of a sprawling investigation by the CIA, FBI and other agencies that has mapped potential links to (Prime Minister Narendra Modi) Modi's inner circle,"" it said.The top American daily -- which is now owned by American billionaire Jeff Bezos, founder and head of Amazon -- said it is investigating a global surge in such campaigns of cross-border repression, as well as the global forces leading India and other nations to employ tactics normally associated with the world's most repressive governments.For this story, Post reporters conducted dozens of interviews with officials, experts and targeted individuals in New Delhi, Washington, Ottawa, London, Prague and Berlin, it said.""In reports that have been closely held within the American government, US intelligence agencies have assessed that the operation targeting Pannun was approved by the RAW chief at the time, Samant Goel,"" the daily claimed.""That finding is consistent with accounts provided to The Washington Post by former senior Indian security officials who had knowledge of the operation and said Goel was under extreme pressure to eliminate the alleged threat of Sikh extremists overseas.""US spy agencies have more tentatively assessed that Modi's national security adviser, Ajit Doval, was probably aware of RAW's plans to kill Sikh activists, but officials emphasised that no smoking gun proof has emerged,"" it said.Quoting officials, The Washington Post said, the foiled assassination was part of an escalating campaign of aggression by RAW against the Indian diaspora in Asia, Europe and North America.The alleged plot to kill Pannun in the US coincided with the June 18 fatal shooting of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Surrey in Canada's British Columbia province in June last year. That operation was also linked to Yadav, according to Western officials.Both plots took place amid a wave of violence in Pakistan, where at least 11 Sikh or Kashmiri separatists living in exile and labelled terrorists by the Modi government have been killed over the past two years, the report said.Senior Indian government officials named in the Washington Post report did not respond to it seeking comment, the daily said.However, when asked about the investigation into the allegations made by the US in the Pannun case, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said last week, ""We have set up a high-level committee. The committee is looking into information that was shared by the American side with us, because they also equally impact our national security.""The high-level committee is looking into those aspects and that is where it is right now, Jaiswal said in New Delhi on April 25.External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on April 1 had said that India's national security interests are involved in its investigation into the alleged involvement of a government official in the assassination plot aimed at Khalistani extremist Pannun.The Washington Post reported that the Biden administration has refrained from making charges against Yadav.""Charging decisions are the prerogative of law enforcement alone,"" National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson told The Washington Post, ""and the Biden NSC has rigorously respected that independence.""""The only US charges made public to date are against an alleged middleman, Nikhil Gupta, who is described in the indictment as an Indian drug and weapons trafficker enlisted to hire a contract killer. Gupta, an Indian national who has denied the charges, was arrested in Prague on June 30 and remains in prison. He is awaiting a Czech court ruling on a US request for his extradition,"" the Post reported.","A RAW official identified as Vikram Yadav was involved in the assassination plot of Sikh separatist leader Gurpatwant Singh Pannun in the US. The Washington Post newspaper said, ""That India would pursue lethal operations in North America has stunned Western security officials"" Yadav's identity and affiliation provide the most explicit evidence to date that the assassination plan was directed from within the Indian spy service.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109699884,imgsize-17120,width-400,resizemode-4/109699884.jpg"

Many courts , including SC, have imposed such a condition in the recent past.Going by an affidavit filed by Google, a bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan said as per the company, it was not possible for others to keep track of a person. “In view of the affidavit... this cannot be imposed as a condition for grant of bail,” the bench said.The advocate appearing for Google told SC that location sharing wouldn’t serve the purpose of tracking the whereabouts of an accused. He said a person could share the location of his house when he might not be there.“We agree that there are two instances where this court has done it, but it cannot be a condition for bail,” the bench said and reserved its order on this aspect. SC had recently imposed this condition while granting bail to Shoma Sen in the Elgar Parishad case .The court had agreed to look into the working of Google location to decide whether an accused could be forced to share his live location through phone with the police as a condition to get bail. The court had sought response from ED, which supported the condition imposed by Delhi HC on an accused in a money laundering case. SC was hearing an appeal filed by ED against grant of bail to the accused. It had earlier refused to stay the bail but questioned the condition.","Many courts, including SC, have imposed such a condition in the recent past.

Terrifying school bus ride in Surat: How alert students stopped vehicle and saved 50 lives,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/surat/drunk-bus-driver-endangers-lives-of-50-schoolchildren-in-surat/articleshow/109709387.cms,"Police arrest driver, seize school bus

SURAT: Fifty students of a private school in the posh Althan area of the city had a fortunate escape after they caught the bus driver drunk and forced him to stop the vehicle before anything untoward happened.An alert Class 10 student forced the driver to stop and pulled out the key noticing that the vehicle was going zigzag on the road due to his drunken condition.The driver, Suresh Singh Rajput (56), started from the Maheshwari Vidhyapeeth at 11am to drop the students home. The bus had travelled for seven km between Althan and Magdalla and the driver escaped the accident at least four times. The rash driving also left two students injured while others had their hearts in their mouth and started screaming. The students in the bus were from Class 1 to Class 12.The incident was a stark reminder of the Haryana bus tragedy where six students lost their lives and 20 injured when the drunk schoolbus driver crashed into a tree on April 11.The school and bus contractors claim they ensure that rash and negligent drivers are not given the vehicles.Mahendra Jhawar, president of Maheshwari Vidhyapeeth, told TOI, ""This is an unfortunate incident. We have given notice to the contractor who runs the buses for our school. We have called students and parents meeting on Tuesday to know what exactly has happened. We assure the parents such incidents will not be repeated. We are dealing with the situation with an iron hand.""Maheshwari Vidhyapeeth has 2,000 students of whom at least 1,300 use school buses or vans as transport.Talking to TOI, bus contractor Vikram Oswal claimed, ""We conduct regular breath analyser tests of drivers before they board the bus.

ICC Arrest Warrant Against Bibi?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/icc-arrest-warrant-against-bibi/articleshow/109704128.cms,"Israeli officials increasingly believe that the International Criminal Court is preparing to issue arrest warrants for senior govt officials on charges related to the conflict with Hamas , according to five Israeli and foreign officials. The Israeli and foreign officials also believe the court is weighing arrest warrants for members of Hamas.If the court proceeds, the Israeli officials could potentially be accused of preventing the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza and pursuing an excessively harsh response to the Hamas-led Oct 7 attacks on Israel , according to two of the five officials, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity.Israeli officials said they believe that PM Benjamin Netanyahu is among those who might be named in a warrant. It is not clear who might be charged from Hamas or what crimes would be cited. The officials did not disclose the nature of the information that led them to be concerned about potential ICC action.Arrest warrants from the court would probably be seen in much of the world as a humbling moral rebuke, particularly to Israel, which for months has faced international backlash over its conduct in Gaza. It could also affect Israel’s policies as the country presses its military campaign against Hamas.The Israeli and foreign officials said they didn’t know what stage the process was in. Any warrants would require approval from a panel of judges and would not necessarily result in a trial or even the targets’ immediate arrest. Karim Khan , the court’s chief prosecutor, has previously confirmed that his team is investigating incidents during the war, but his office declined to comment for this article, saying that it does not “respond to speculation in media.”Netanyahu’s office also would not comment, but Friday the PM said on social media that any intervention by the ICC “would set a dangerous precedent that threatens the soldiers and officials of all democracies fighting savage terrorism and wanton aggression.” Netanyahu did not explain what prompted his statement.Based in The Hague, the ICC is the world’s only permanent international court with the power to prosecute individuals accused of war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity. The court has no police force of its own. Instead, it relies on its 124 members, which include most European countries but not Israel or the US, to arrest those named in warrants. It cannot try defendants in absentia. But warrants from the court can pose obstacles to travel for officials named in them.If the ICC does issue arrest warrants, they would come with deep stigmatisation, placing those named in them in the same category as foreign leaders such as Omar al-Bashir, the deposed prez of Sudan, and Russia Prez Putin, who was the subject of a warrant last year tied to his war against Ukraine.",Israeli officials believe that PM Benjamin Netanyahu is among those who might be named in a warrant.

Oleksandr Syrsky , Ukraine’s top commander, said in a statement Sunday in which he announced that his troops had retreated from two villages west of Avdiivka , a Ukrainian stronghold in the east that Russia seized earlier this year, and another village farther south.Military experts say Moscow’s recent advances reflect its desire to exploit a window of opportunity to press ahead with attacks before the first batch of a new US military aid package arrives in Ukraine to help relieve its troops. Congress recently approved $60 billion in military aid for Ukraine, and Prez Biden signed it last week.During a visit to Kyiv on Monday, Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg said the many months it took Congress to approve new military aid to Ukraine and Europe’s failure to deliver ammunition on time had led to “serious consequences on the battlefield”. “When we are not delivering as we should, then Ukrainians are paying the price,” he said.","Russian troops have captured or entered around a half-dozen villages on Ukraine's eastern front over the past week.

The number of arrests nationwide has surpassed 900 since New York police removed a pro-Palestinian protest encampment at Columbia University and arrested more than 100 demonstrators on April 18.Colleges have cited property damage, outside provocateurs, antisemitic expressions or just failures to heed warnings as reasons to arrest students. Many school leaders have insisted that people outside their colleges are stoking the confrontations, despite limited evidence backing their claims. In many cases, the groups of protesters have mostly involved students and university employees, but a notable exception was at Washington University on Saturday. Of the 100 arrests made, only 23 were students and four were employees, the university said Sunday.","Protesters on both sides of the rancorous debate shouted and shoved each other during duelling demonstrations Sunday at the University of California, Los Angeles.

The incident, which occurred on Saturday, saw three students hoisting the Palestinian flag over the iconic John Harvard statue, escalating tensions amid ongoing campus demonstrations.The action coincided with a series of protests across the US in response to Israel's military actions against Hamas, sparked by the deadly October 7 attacks which resulted in over a thousand Israeli casualties.Similar protests have been reported at other Ivy League schools and campuses nationwide, including Columbia University, a New York Post report said.A Harvard spokesperson condemned the flag replacement, saying, “The flags raised by protesters over University Hall were removed by Harvard facilities staff. The actions are a violation of University policy and the individuals involved will be subject to disciplinary action.”The incident has stirred significant online debate. X user Mor Hogeg criticized the protesters' motives, stating, “These pro-Hamas protesters’ sole agenda is to eradicate every western value and every basic human right while establishing an Islamic Sharia law regime. They are starting with the Jews in Israel as their main objective and will continue with the entire west. It is not a fight of Israel against Hamas – the fight is between a culture of life and a culture of death. WAKE UP!”Another commenter, Mark Isaacson, suggested a more severe response: “This is where the National Guard needs to be called in,” highlighting a perceived lack of adequate role models among political leaders for young people.The Harvard Crimson reported that no US flag was flying at the time of the incident, noting that the American flag is typically displayed from Monday to Friday and stored properly at other times. The university has a history of displaying flags of visiting dignitaries at the site but the Palestinian flag incident has marked a significant deviation spurred by the current geopolitical tensions.","Three students hoisted the Palestinian flag over the iconic John Harvard statue, escalating tensions amid ongoing campus demonstrations.

NEW DELHI: Ruling out any agreement, former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said that he is ready to endure additional nine years behind bars rather than engage in any negotiations with what he termed as the forces that have ""enslaved"" the nation.In his message, Khan highlighted what he described as the imposition of the ""worst dictatorship"" on the country, warning of its detrimental effects on the economy, governance, democracy and the judiciary.Having spent the past nine months in prison due to what he claimed are ""fake and concocted cases,"" Khan affirmed his readiness to continue serving time if necessary. ""I will remain in jail if I have to for nine more years, or more, but I will never strike a deal with those who have enslaved my nation”, Khan said in a statement.Since his ouster from power through a no-confidence motion in April 2022, the 71-year-old former cricketer-turned-politician has faced convictions in multiple cases, leading to his imprisonment at Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi. Khan's political party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), has encountered challenges following his fall-out with the influential military, including arrests and defections, particularly after the unrest sparked by his arrest last year.Khan's statement follows remarks by PTI leader Shehryar Afridi, who asserted the party's willingness to engage in dialogue excluding certain political factions. He dismissed the Pakistan Peoples Party and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz as a ""rejected lot"" and reiterated the PTI's commitment to engaging with the army chief for Pakistan's future.Addressing speculation regarding alleged negotiations, PTI leader Barrister Gohar Ali Khan reaffirmed the party's disinterest in and denial of any talks with external entities.Independent candidates supported by the PTI secured over 90 seats in the National Assembly during the February 8 general elections. However, a post-election alliance formed by the PMN-L and the PPP sidelined the PTI, preventing it from forming a federal government.","Imran Khan says he is ready to endure additional nine years behind bars.

Columbia suspends pro-Palestinian protesters after stalemate in talks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/columbia-suspends-pro-palestinian-protesters-after-encampment-talks-stall/articleshow/109708467.cms,"(With Reuters input)

NEW YORK: After days of stalemate in talks seeking end of pro-Palestinian protest on campus, Columbia University on Monday began suspending protestors who refused to dismantle a tent encampment on its New York City campus.University President Nemat Minouche Shafik said in a statement that days of negotiations between student organizers and academic leaders had failed to persuade demonstrators to remove the dozens of tents set up to express opposition to Israel 's war in Gaza .The crackdown at Columbia, which is at the center of Gaza-related protests causing turmoil on university campuses across the US in recent weeks, occurred when police at the University of Texas at Austin apprehended numerous students who were sprayed with pepper spray at a pro-Palestinian rally.Columbia sent a letter on Monday morning to alert students that failure to leave the encampment by 2 pm (Eastern Time) and sign a form agreeing to follow university policies would result in suspension and make them unable to finish the semester successfully.""We have begun suspending students as part of this next phase of our efforts to ensure safety on our campus,"" said Ben Chang, a university spokesperson, at a briefing on Monday evening.""The encampment has created an unwelcoming environment for many of our Jewish students and faculty and a noisy distraction that interferes with the teaching, learning and preparing for final exams,"" Chang said.Earlier, Shafik said Columbia would not divest from finances in Israel, a key demand of the protesters. Instead, she offered to invest in health and education in Gaza and make Columbia's direct investment holdings more transparent.Protesters have vowed to keep their encampment on the Manhattan campus until Columbia meets three demands: divestment , transparency in university finances, and amnesty for students and faculty disciplined for their part in the protests.""These repulsive scare tactics mean nothing compared to the deaths of over 34,000 Palestinians. We will not move until Columbia meets our demands or we are moved by force,"" leaders of the Columbia Student Apartheid Divest coalition said in a statement read at a news conference following the deadline.Numerous students, faculty, and outside observers vehemently criticised Shafik for calling the New York City police two weeks ago to disband the encampment.After more than 100 arrests were made, the students rebuilt the encampment on a lawn lined with hedges on the university grounds shortly after the police action on April 18.Since that time, students at many campuses across the United States, from California to New England, have established similar encampments to express their frustration with the Israeli military action in Gaza and the perceived involvement of their schools in supporting it.The rallies supporting Palestine have caused a heated discussion on campus about the boundary school authorities should set between freedom of speech and hateful language.Students who are protesting against Israel's military offensive in Gaza, including Jewish peace activists, have mentioned that they are facing accusations of antisemitism simply for criticizing the Israeli government or showing support for Palestinian rights.""The movement itself is not antisemitic,"" said Nicholas Fink, a freshman history major at Columbia who has not participated in the protests.",University President Nemat Minouche Shafik said in a statement that days of negotiations between student organizers and academic leaders had failed to persuade demonstrators to remove the tents.

NEW DELHI: Three officers, including a deputy US marshal , were shot dead, and several other law enforcement officers were wounded on Monday while attempting to serve a fugitive warrant in North Carolina , according to federal authorities.Officers who were part of a US Marshals task force were conducting the operation when an individual started shooting at them from inside a home in a residential neighbourhood in Charlotte .One suspect was reportedly discovered dead within the residence.The shooting led to a prompt law enforcement reaction as police cars and ambulances hurried to the spot and closed off nearby streets. Gunfire persisted for a few minutes following the initial shooting.WSOC-TV reported that their helicopter recorded an armored vehicle driving through yards and knocking over recycling bins. Subsequently, officers removed a person with blood on their shirt, who was then taken to an ambulance .After the home was cleared, the helicopter pilot mentioned that he was unable to display the front lawn of the home due to the disturbing nature of the scene. Several armoured vehicles were parked on the lawns and driveways of the older suburban neighbourhood, which was characterized by tree-lined streets and brick homes.""Ambulances, police and everything everywhere just started rushing down,"" said Williams as she waited in her car to be allowed to go home and check on her daughter, who broadcast what she saw on social media.Four Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools were placed on lockdown around afternoon dismissal, but that was lifted in the late afternoon, the district said.Police urged people to stay away from the neighborhood and asked residents to remain inside their homes.North Carolina Gov.

, 2024 and Columbia University, 1968

Students are aware of the history

Not everyone supports the protests

NEW YORK: College students taking up space and making demands for change. University administrators facing pressure to get things back under control. Police brought in to make arrests. At other schools: students taking note, and sometimes taking action.The pro-Palestinian demonstration and subsequent arrests at Columbia that have set off similar protests at campuses nationwide these days and even internationally aren't new ground for students at the Ivy League school .They're the latest in a Columbia tradition that dates back more than five decades - one that also helped provide inspiration for the anti-apartheid protest of the 1980s, the Iraq war protests, and more.""When you're going to Columbia, you know you're going to an institution which has an honored place in the history of American protest,"" said Mark Naison, professor of history and African & African American Studies at Fordham University and himself a participant in the 1968 demonstrations. ""Whenever there is a movement, you know Columbia is going to be right there.""It's part of Columbia's lore, students taking part in this month's demonstrations point out - recognized by the school itself in commemorative anniversary programming and taught about in classes.""A lot of students here are aware of what happened in 1968,"" said Sofia Ongele, 23, among those who joined the encampment in response to this month's arrests.The end of an academic year was also approaching in April of that year when students took over five campus buildings. There were multiple reasons. Some were protesting the university's connection to an institute doing weapon research for the Vietnam War; others opposed how the elite school treated Black and brown residents in the community around the school as well as the atmosphere for minority students.After several days, Columbia's president allowed a thousand New York Police Department officers to be brought in to clear most demonstrators out. The arrests, 700 of them, were not gentle. Fists were flying, clubs swinging. Dozens of students and more than a dozen officers were injured.It's never been forgotten history. That includes now, when pro-Palestinian students calling on the university to divest from any economic ties to Israel over the war in Gaza set up a tent encampment earlier this month and more than 100 were arrested. It helped spark similar demonstrations at campuses around the country and world.The storied protest past is one of the reasons Ongele chose Columbia for college and came here from her native Santa Clarita, California. ""I wanted to be in an environment where people were indeed socially conscious,"" she said.When it comes to protest, ""We have not only the privilege but the responsibility to continue in the shoes of those who came before us,"" Ongele said. The goal, she said: to ensure ""that we're able to maintain the integrity of this university as one that is indeed socially aware, one that does have students that do care deeply about what goes on in the world, what goes on in our communities, and what goes on in the lives of the students that make up our community.""Columbia University officials did not respond to an email asking about the school's position on the legacy of the 1968 events. Those events, like the current protest, ""sparked a huge increase in student activism around the country,"" Mark Rudd, a leader of that protest, said in an email to The Associated Press. ""Myself and others spent the entire year after April 1968 traveling the country, spreading to campuses the spirit of Columbia.""But the echoes of the past aren't only in inspiration. Then, as now, the protest had its detractors. Naison said the disruption to campus life, and to law and order, angered many at Columbia and outside of it.""Student protesters are not popular people in the United States of America,"" he said. ""We weren't popular in the '60s. We accomplished a tremendous amount. But we also helped drive the country to the right.""That has a corollary these days with those critical of the protests, who have condemned what they say is a descent into antisemitism. Some Jewish students have said they have felt targeted for their identity and afraid to be on campus and university presidents have come under political pressure to clamp down and use methods like police intervention.Columbia University President Minouche Shafik had just testified in front of a congressional panel investigating concerns about antisemitism at elite schools when the camp initially went up. Despite her requesting police action the next day for what she called a ""harassing and intimidating environment,"" Republicans in Congress have called for her resignation.""Freedom of speech is so important, but not beyond the right to security,"" said Itai Dreifuss, 25, a third-year student who grew up in the United States and Israel. He was near the encampment this past week, standing in front of posters taped to a wall of the people who were taken hostage by Hamas in the Oct 7 attack that set off the current conflagration.That feeling among some students that personal animosity is being directed against them is a difference between 1968 and now, Naison said. That conflict between demonstrators and their decriers ""is far more visceral,"" Naison asserts, which he says makes this time even more fraught.""It's history repeating itself, but it's also uncharted territory,"" he said. ""What we have here is a whole group of people who see these protests as a natural extension of fighting for justice, and a whole other group of people who see this as a deadly attack on them and their history and tradition. And that makes it very difficult for university officials to manage.""","Protesters at Columbia are aware of the history of protests at the Ivy League school. In 1968, students took over five campus buildings and more than 700 people were arrested. The protests helped inspire the anti-apartheid protest of the 1980s and the Iraq war protests.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109703104,imgsize-1805244,width-400,resizemode-4/109703104.jpg"

The 6-year-old American shorthair had disappeared a week earlier, and Clark initially thought the call was a prank.It turned out that Galena had climbed into a 3-by-3-foot Amazon returns package containing five pairs of steel-toed boots and was transported to an Amazon warehouse in California.Remarkably, the cat survived the journey without food or water, thanks to a partially unglued seam on the box that allowed oxygen to circulate and mild weather conditions that prevented overheating or freezing.""It's really a miracle that she was able to survive,"" Clark said.Clark believes that Galena might have jumped into the box while her husband was packing it and left to get some tape to seal it. The couple didn't notice the added weight of the cat when they mailed the package on April 10. They quickly realized that their shy, indoor cat was missing and searched their house and neighborhood extensively, fearing the worst.The call from the veterinarian came after an Amazon employee, Brandy Hunter, brought Galena in after co-workers discovered the cat inside a returns box. The veterinarian identified Galena through her microchip and contacted Clark. Ms Hunter said she had driven to the warehouse to catch and care for the cat, which had spent days in the box ""in the back of a trailer full of items being returned to Amazon.""Clark and her husband immediately booked a flight to California and were reunited with Galena at the veterinarian's clinic the next day.

He was in custody on bail amounting to $50,000, as New York Post reported.The parking valet was discovered with Mint inside his white van on Eddy Street in the city’s notoriously dangerous Tenderloin District neighborhood according to booking records.Mint — who was deemed “at-risk” due to previous threats of suicide — was uninjured.They informed the detectives that they had chosen to leave their Bolinas home on their own accord and have now been reunited with their family.The Standard reported that Dizefalo is suspected of coaxing the teen to run away.Mint’s parents, Stewart Butterfield — who co-founded the instant messaging app Slack before selling it to Salesforce in 2020 — and Caterina Fake — who co-founded the photo-sharing app Flickr, thanked investigators for bringing their child home.“A heartfelt thanks to all the family, friends, volunteers and strangers who called in tips and made this recovery possible,” their parents and stepfather, fellow tech founder Jyri Engeström, stated in an email to the Standard and other local outlets. “We especially want to thank the seasoned law enforcement officers who understand the very real threat of predators who use the allure of drugs to groom teenagers.”Mint was last seen in Bolinas on the night of April 21 and was reported missing by their mother the following morning.The teenager supposedly left a note to inform their parents that they had planned to run away before being discovered with Dizefalo this week.Authorities believed that Mint had been in the Tenderloin neighborhood because Mint was known to frequent the area before running away from home, as confirmed by the police.","Christopher ""Kio"" Dizefalo, 26, is suspected of coaxing Mint Butterfield, 16, to run away.

Why US is buying 81 Soviet-era combat aircraft from Russia's ally,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-us-is-buying-81-soviet-era-combat-aircraft-from-russias-ally/articleshow/109696911.cms,"NEW DELHI: The United States has purchased 81 Soviet-era fighter and bomber aircraft from Kazakhstan , which recently auctioned off 117 military planes, including MiG-31 interceptors, MiG-27 fighter bombers, MiG-29 fighters, and Su-24 bombers. These aircraft, stemming from the 1970s and 1980s, were sold for a total of one billion Kazakhstani tenge, approximately $2.26 million, averaging about $19,300 per plane.Kazakhstan, historically a close ally of Russia but increasingly aligning with Western interests, is upgrading its air fleet, leading to the disposal of these aged aircraft, described as unusable for modern warfare.The sale, conducted through offshore companies, has sparked speculation about the US's motives, including potential use of the aircraft in Ukraine where similar models are still operational, a report in Insider said.According to a report by the Ukrainian Telegram channel Insider UA, the aircraft could either be used for spare parts or strategically as decoys at airfields to confuse enemy targeting. This comes at a time when Ukraine continues to rely on Soviet-era weapons, integrating them with Western technology to bolster its defenses against Russian aggression.The MiG-31, a supersonic interceptor, was crucial during the Cold War for defending Soviet airspace. The MiG-27, a derivative of the MiG-23, served primarily in ground-attack roles and saw extensive use during the Soviet-Afghan War. The MiG-29 remains active in several air forces due to its prowess in air-to-air combat, and the Su-24, an all-weather tactical bomber, is still operational in various countries, including the Russian and Ukrainian air forces.This acquisition underscores the ongoing geopolitical shifts in Central Asia and the delicate balance Kazakhstan maintains between its historical ties to Russia and its burgeoning relationships with Western nations.","Kazakhstan recently auctioned off 117 military planes, including MiG-31 interceptors.

These protests are part of a broader movement where students are demanding that their universities cut ties with companies that support Israel’s military actions in Gaza, and in some cases, with Israel altogether.The protests have been driven by various student groups, which generally operate independently.However, many students involved express that their actions are influenced by solidarity with peers from other universities.Recent events highlight the intensity of these protests: At an Ivy League university in New York, pro-Palestinian student protesters established a tent encampment. The initial police attempt to dismantle this encampment on April 18 led to the arrest of more than 100 protesters. Rather than deterring the students, this police action galvanized them, prompting a nationwide wave of support and motivating Columbia protesters to reassemble and continue their demonstrations.Meanwhile, a research led by a University of Chicago professor, Robert Pape, has unveiled a concerning trend of escalating fear among students across numerous college campuses. This study, which was discussed on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” highlights the growing anxiety felt by students, particularly among Jewish and Muslim populations.According to a Politico report, professor Pape’s research involved a substantial survey of 5,000 students at hundreds of colleges, revealing that 56% of Jewish students and 52% of Muslim students reported feeling in personal danger. A significant portion of non-Jewish and non-Muslim students, 16%, also expressed feelings of being threatened. The study attributes these fears to direct observations of acts of violence and intimidation on campus, including attacks on Jewish buildings and counterattacks against Muslims.The timing of the research, conducted between December and January, coincides with heightened tensions following the October 7 Hamas attacks in Israel and the subsequent Israeli invasion of Gaza. This period also precedes a surge of campus protests related to the Israel-Hamas conflict , which has seen a rise in complaints about intimidating and hateful rhetoric.Professor Pape, a political science expert with a focus on terrorism, emphasized the need for a balanced approach to reducing campus tensions. He critiqued the prevailing methods of crowd control and political grandstanding, advocating for more thoughtful strategies that consider all sides of the conflicts.The findings suggest a shift from the historical context of campus protests, such as those in the 1960s associated with civil rights and anti-Vietnam War movements. Pape noted the unique challenges of today's campus climate, which differ significantly from past decades, underscoring the need for contemporary solutions to address these evolving issues.",Student protests concerning the Israel-Hamas war have surged on numerous college campuses.

Biden or Trump: Who will win as per '13 Keys' predictions?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-vs-joe-biden-historian-allan-lichtman-13-keys-model-us-presidential-election/articleshow/109691102.cms,"NEW DELHI: Allan Lichtman , a historian known for accurately predicting presidential election outcomes since 1984, has recently said that significant mishaps would need to occur for Joe Biden to lose the upcoming election to Donald Trump. Lichtman, who teaches history at American University in Washington, DC, has developed a forecasting system called ""Historian Who Predicted Every Presidential Winner Since 1984,"" which relies on historical factors rather than opinion polls .Despite national polls suggesting Biden is struggling and trailing in several key swing states, Lichtman remains confident in Biden's chances, citing that the president has already secured two of his ""13 Keys"": no serious primary challenges and the advantage of incumbency. ""That's two keys off the top,"" Lichtman explained, ""That means six more keys would have to fall to predict his defeat. A lot would have to go wrong for Biden to lose.""Lichtman, who accurately foresaw Trump’s victory in 2016 and Biden’s in 2020, expressed skepticism about current polling, emphasizing that ""polls six, seven months before an election have zero predictive value ."" He also warned that while Biden's campaign shouldn't be overly confident, unforeseeable major events could still impact the election. “It’s always possible there could be a cataclysmic enough event outside the scope of the keys that could affect the election,” he noted.As per a Daily Mail report, the historian also pointed to the Covid-19 pandemic as a decisive factor in his correct prediction of Biden's 2020 victory, saying, ""The pandemic is what did him in. He congratulated me for predicting him but he didn't understand the keys. The message of the keys is it's governance not campaigning that counts and instead of dealing substantively with the pandemic, as we know, he thought he could talk his way out of it and that sank him.""While some of Lichtman's keys could potentially favor Trump, including the presence of a significant third-party challenger and aspects of social unrest, Lichtman still sees the 2024 election trending towards Biden. He candidly acknowledges the limits of his system, expressing the personal pressure he faces: ""It’s nerve-racking because there are a lot of people who’d love to see me fail."" He added, ""I’m human. It doesn’t mean my system’s wrong. Nothing is perfect in the human world.""","Allan Lichtman, a historian known for accurately predicting presidential election outcomes since 1984, has recently said that significant mishaps would need to occur for Joe Biden to lose the upcoming election to Donald Trump.

Blinken says Israel must still do more to boost humanitarian aid to Gaza,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/blinken-says-israel-must-still-do-more-to-boost-humanitarian-aid-to-gaza/articleshow/109689320.cms,"RIYADH: US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Monday that Israel must still do more to increase the flow of humanitarian aid into the besieged Gaza Strip and that he would use his current Middle East trip - his seventh to the region since the Israel-Hamas war started in October - to press that case with Israeli leaders.Speaking to Gulf Cooperation Council foreign ministers in Riyadh, Blinken said best way to ease the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza would be to conclude an elusive cease-fire agreement that would release hostages held by Hamas.But, in the meantime, he said it was critical to improve conditions now.""The most effective way to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, to alleviate the suffering of children, women and men, and to create space for a more just and durable solution is to get a cease-fire and the hostages out,"" he said.""But we're also not waiting on a cease-fire to take the necessary steps to meet the needs of civilians in Gaza,"" Blinken said. He said that because President Joe Biden has been insisting that Israel do more, including in his phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday, there had been improvements, although not nearly enough.""We have seen measurable progress in the last few weeks, including the opening of new crossings and increased volume of aid delivery to Gaza and within Gaza, and the building of the US maritime corridor, which will open in the coming weeks. But it is not enough. We still need to get more aid in and around Gaza,"" he said.""We need to improve deconfliction with humanitarian assistance workers. And we have to find greater efficiency and greater safety and deconfliction is at the heart of that. And, finally we have to make sure that we're focusing not just on inputs, but on impact.""Scores of relief workers have been killed since the conflict began, and a deadly Israeli attack on a World Central Kitchen aid convoy in Gaza this month only highlighted the dangers and difficulties of protecting them. Israel has said the strike was a mistake and has disciplined officials involved.World Central Kitchen says it would resume operations in Gaza on Monday after a four-week suspension.The war has ground on since Hamas' deadly Oct. 7 attacks on Israel with little end in sight: more than 34,000 Palestinians have been killed, hundreds of thousands more are displaced and a humanitarian crisis in Gaza is worsening.The conflict has fueled mass protests around the world that have spread to American college campuses. US support for Israel, particularly arms transfers, has come under particular criticism, something the administration is keenly aware poses potential problems for Biden in an election year.Blinken's trip comes amid renewed concerns about the conflict spreading in the Middle East and with once-promising prospects for Israeli-Saudi rapprochement effectively on hold as Israel refuses to consider one of the Saudis' main conditions for normalized relations: the creation of a Palestinian state.Meanwhile, the Biden administration has been warning Israel against a major military operation on the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where more than a million Palestinians have fled to escape fighting further north. Israel has not yet launched such an offensive, but Netanyahu has repeatedly said that one will take place, asserting that it is the only way to wipe out Hamas.Both topics were discussed during the Biden-Netanyahu phone call on Sunday, according to the White House and US officials.During his trip, Blinken said he would also underscore the absolute importance of not allowing the Israel-Hamas conflict to engulf the region.The danger of conflagration was underscored this month when a suspected Israeli attack on an Iranian consular building in Syria prompted an unprecedented direct missile and drone response by Iran against Israel. An apparent retaliatory Israeli strike on Iran followed.Although the tit-for-tat cycle appears to have ended for now, deep concerns remain that Iran or its proxies in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria or Yemen could act in such a way as to provoke a greater response from Israel or that Israel might take action that Iran feels it must retaliate for.",US Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Israel must still do more to increase the flow of humanitarian aid into the besieged Gaza Strip.

It is not an admirable step because, at this serious juncture of our national life and the lowest point of our economic condition, we should be focusing on substantive issues rather than taking trivial and inconsequential decisions,"" The News quoted Mehboob as saying.Meanwhile, lawyer Abdul Moiz Jaferii highlighted the absence of any pretence of law or order in the notification regarding Dar's appointment on the said post.However, Supreme Court Advocate Basil Nabi Malik is of the view that Article 90(2) of the Constitution does allow the prime minister to act either directly or through his federal ministers.",The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) came down heavily against the Shehbaz Sarif- led government over the appointment of Ishaq Dar as Deputy PM.

Sindhi nationalist condemns forced conversion of Hindu girls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/sindhi-nationalist-condemns-forced-conversion-of-hindu-girls/articleshow/109655440.cms,"KARACHI: In a recent video message, Sohail Abro , chairman of the Jeay Sindh Freedom Movement (JSFM), urged international human rights organisations to intervene for the safe release of Priya Kumari , a young Hindu girl who went missing two years ago while serving mourners of a Muharram procession in Sindh. Abro highlighted the alarming trend of Sindhi Hindu girls being forcibly converted and married off to Muslim men, often under the influence of extremist figures in the country.He criticised the judiciary for siding with individuals accused of such actions and called for justice for victims like Priya Kumari.""Sindhi Hindu girls are forcibly converted and married off to Muslim men and people like Mian Mithu are free to do such activities. Even when girls express their desire to go with their family, courts refuse to do so as they are on the side of people like Mian Mithu"" said Sohail in his message on social media. The extremist cleric Mian Mithu is accused of kidnapping and forcing religious conversions of Hindu teenage girls in Pakistan.In a significant event, a rally was organized by the Jeay Sindh Freedom Movement (JSFM) commemorating the death anniversary of GM Syed, a prominent Sindhi politician. The participation of demonstrators from various districts of Sindh suggested a widespread sentiment among Sindhis for their rights and freedoms.The issues highlighted, such as the recovery of missing persons and the protection of Sindhi Hindu girls from forced conversions, reflect ongoing concerns within the Sindhi community""Sindhi and Baloch activists are abducted by Pakistani intelligence officials. For several years these activists remain missing. A political activist and student Sohail Raza Bhatti has been missing for the past eight years. No one knows whether he is alive or dead. His parents are knocking on the doors of the press club and courts,"" said Sohail in the video message.","Sohail Abro urges international human rights organisations to intervene for the safe release of Priya Kumari, a young Hindu girl who went missing two years ago.
