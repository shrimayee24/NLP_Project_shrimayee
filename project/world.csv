30–35 terrorists on radar: Army steps up counterterror ops in J&K; heightened vigilance amid 'Chillai Kalan',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/3035-terrorists-on-radar-army-steps-up-counterterror-ops-in-jk-heightened-vigilance-amid-chillai-kalan/articleshow/126211810.cms,"'India Faces Two War Realities: Counter Terror Strikes And Long Conflicts', Says CDS Anil Chauhan

NEW DELHI: Amid the ongoing Chillai Kalan — the 40-day bone-chilling winter period — in Jammu and Kashmir , the Army has intensified its counter-terrorism operations across the Kishtwar and Doda districts.Army units have expanded their operational reach into higher and snowbound areas to pursue and neutralise Pakistani terrorists attempting to exploit the harsh season for concealment, news agency ANI reported, citing sources.According to sources, various intelligence agencies asses that there are approximately 30 to 35 Pakistani terrorists currently in the Jammu region.Inputs gathered over the past few months suggest that these groups, finding themselves cornered by successful counter-terror operations, have shifted deeper into higher and middle mountain reaches of the region — areas now devoid of habitation. These terrorists are believed to be seeking temporary winter hideouts to evade detection and avoid direct confrontation with security troops, they added.The sources said that the Army and security forces have adopted a proactive winter posture, establishing temporary bases and surveillance posts deep within snow-covered areas to maintain continuous pressure on potential terrorist hideouts.This year's counter-terror strategy has been the integrated approach to operations. The Indian Army is leading a synchronised effort involving multiple security and law enforcement agencies, including the civil administration, the Jammu and Kashmir Police (JKP), the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), the Special Operations Group (SOG), Forest Guards, and Village Defence Guards (VDGs).This inter-agency cooperation ensures seamless intelligence sharing, resource optimisation, and sharper operational execution, sources said.ANI reported that intelligence from multiple agencies is carefully synthesised to draw precise situational pictures of terrorist movement and hideout patterns. Once intelligence is verified, coordinated joint operations are planned and launched, minimising overlaps and ensuring maximum impact with tactical precision.The synergy among ground units and intelligence frameworks has enhanced response time, enabling security forces to act the moment actionable information surfaces.According to the report, the terrorists, who are hiding in this region, are attempting to coerce or threaten local villagers for shelter and food supplies, though their support among locals and overground workers has sharply declined.Sources emphasised that this season's winter operations are guided by a clear doctrinal approach: Surveillance to Swift Operations and then Back to Surveillance.The philosophy emphasises an unbroken cycle of monitoring, quick response, and sustained watchfulness, minimising the chances of terrorists regrouping. This methodical rhythm allows forces to keep pressure constant while conserving resources and adapting to environmental challenges, they added.This comes with the onset of Chillai Kalan, the harshest phase of Kashmir's winter, spanning from December 21 to January 31. During this period, most activity in the mountains comes to a standstill.Meanwhile, the Indian Army has also deployed specially trained winter warfare sub-units across several key sectors. These troops, adept in high-altitude survival, snow navigation, avalanche response, and snow combat, have been instrumental in maintaining operational effectiveness during the winter surge.",The Army has intensified its counter-terrorism operations across the Kishtwar and Doda districts.

CHANDRAPUR: The SIT probing illegal sale of a farmer's kidney in Chandrapur, Maharashtra, has uncovered a direct operational link to China. Fresh disclosures indicate that a Chinese surgeon, Dr Chiang, conducted transplant procedures in Cambodia and supplied harvested organs to clients in his home country.The revelations, based on statements of two key accus-ed during interrogation, have prompted officials to expand the scope of inquiry across international networks.Police sources said Ramakrishna Sunchu of Solapur (who also posed as 'Dr Krishna' and Mallesh) and Himanshu Bhardwaj from Mohali, Punjab, told interrogators Chiang performed the surgeries and ensured that all procured kidneys were routed to Chinese recipients.The kidney of Roshan Kule, a marginal farmer from Minthur village who was lured into selling his organ, was allegedly transplanted to a patient in China within 12 hours of the kidney removal, sources said.Investigators believe Chiang played a key role in recruiting intermediaries, allegedly enticing Sunchu and Bhardwaj with significant financial rewards to supply donors. Police are pursuing the third accused in the chain from West Bengal, who remains on the run.Himanshu Bhardwaj once ran a tour and travel business. His life took a turn when he fell in love with a young woman and began taking care of all her expenses.When she expressed her desire to travel to the US, Himanshu decided to fulfil her dream — even if it meant selling his own kidney.That decision made him enter the kidney trade.","SIT probing illegal sale of a farmer's kidney in Chandrapur, Maharashtra, has uncovered a direct operational link to China.

Twist in court: 2nd husband testifies for 1st; woman loses 17-year old domestic violence case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/twist-in-court-2nd-husband-testifies-for-1st-woman-loses-17-year-old-domestic-violence-case/articleshow/126211132.cms,"Representative image

‘Woman married 2nd time, not entitled to maintenance’

MUMBAI: In an unexpected turn, a woman’s current husband took the witness stand to depose on behalf of her ex-spouse, ending a nearly 17-year-old domestic violence case.The case, initiated in 2009 by the woman, alleged years of torture by her first husband. She sought protection and monetary relief, claiming she was ousted from her home. However, a Borivli court ruled that with her current husband confirming marriage, she was not entitled to maintenance.Additional chief judicial magistrate B N Chikne said, “As such, in such facts and circumstances and the evidence on record, it appears to me that it is proved from the evidence and documents produced on record, after divorce from the respondent No. 1 (ex-husband), the applicant (woman) performed a second marriage. Therefore, she is not entitled to get maintenance from respondent No. 1.”The judgment centred on the revelation that the woman had entered into a second marriage while her original maintenance claim was still active.In her plea, the woman said she married her ex-husband in 2005 through an arranged setup. She alleged that she later found out that the man was already married and his first wife began to frequent their home.Along with the ex-husband, his first wife would abuse her too. She alleged numerous incidents of physical, emotional and economic abuse. In Dec 2009, the first husband was directed to pay the woman an interim monthly maintenance of Rs 3,200 until the disposal of the case.While the woman’s sister served as a witness to support her allegations, the man brought to court an imam who officiated the woman’s second marriage, a handwriting and fingerprint expert who testified on the signatures and thumb impression on the nikahnama of the second marriage, and her husband.The trajectory of the trial shifted dramatically when her ex-husband produced her current husband as a defence witness to confirm their marital status. By confirming the second marriage through the evidence of the current husband himself, the defence nullified the woman’s status as a dependent of her former spouse.The court ruled the existence of this second union, confirmed by the man who entered into it, extinguished the woman's right to seek further maintenance or protection from her first husband.","The case, initiated in 2009 by the woman, alleged years of torture by her first husband.

Tattoo affair: Bengaluru man gets life term for murdering wife; strangled her when sleeping pills didn’t work,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/court-hands-life-term-to-bengaluru-man-for-wifes-murder-after-he-was-caught-cheating-due-to-tattoo/articleshow/126208182.cms,"(AI Image)

BENGALURU: What began as a tattoo of ""another woman"" on the husband's forearm ended in the murder of his wife and a sentence of life imprisonment for him.Earlier this week, a city court convicted 33-year-old Vinay Kumar, a resident of A Narayanapura in Mahadevapura, of killing his wife Ashwini D, 29, inside their home in April 2021. Since his arrest, Kumar had remained lodged in Bengaluru Central Prison at Parappana Agrahara, with his attempt to secure bail failing.Kumar and Ashwini, an engineer and his younger sister's classmate, met at a family wedding, fell in love, and married in 2018. But the marriage began to unravel three years later when Kumar returned home with a tattoo reading ""Roopa"" inked on his right forearm. When Ashwini questioned him about the tattoo and demanded to know who Roopa was, Kumar gave evasive answers. She later discovered that he was having an affair.According to the prosecution, Kumar feared she might take legal or personal action against him. Unwilling to end the relationship with Roopa, he decided to eliminate his wife.Public prosecutor Satyavati HR told TOI the murder was planned carefully. On the night of April 16, 2021, Kumar purchased a can of beer and a strip of 10 sleeping tablets before returning home.After having chicken biryani for dinner, he forced Ashwini to drink the beer, secretly mixed with the tablets. She soon slipped into a deep sleep. Kumar believed the overdose would be fatal. When he found Ashwini still breathing early the next morning, Kumar strangled her using her dupatta.""Afterwards, he stepped out of the house and raised the alarm, claiming his wife was lying motionless,"" Satyavati said. With a neighbour's help, he took Ashwini to a nearby hospital, where doctors declared her brought dead. Kumar initially managed to convince Ashwini's parents and relatives that it was a natural death. However, Mahadevapura police ordered an autopsy, while viscera samples were sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory.The autopsy revealed the death was due to strangulation, leading to Kumar's arrest. Subsequent FSL reports confirmed the presence of alcohol and sleeping tablets in Ashwini's system.During the trial, circumstantial evidence sealed Kumar's fate. Testimonies from a wine shop cashier and a medical store assistant, backed by CCTV footage, established that Kumar had purchased the beer and sleeping tablets on the night of the murder.After police filed the charge-sheet, Kumar filed his bail application. Police, however, discovered that the surety documents submitted were fake and informed the court that his family had distanced themselves from him after the crime. The bail plea was rejected, forcing him to spend time in prison.","Vinay Kumar, 33, convicted of killing his wife Ashwini D, 29, inside their home in April 2021.

'Tragic that patriotic people of northeast are referred to as Chinese and attacked'

DEHRADUN: A 24-year-old MBA student from Tripura, who confronted a group of men hurling racial slurs at him and his younger brother, died in a Dehradun hospital on Friday after fighting for his life for over 14 days. The stabbing happened on Dec 9, minutes after Anjel Chakma said, ""We are not Chinese... We are Indians. What certificate should we show to prove that?"" The six men allegedly responded with brutal violence.What began as a regular grocery run to the local market in the Selaqui area of Uttarakhand's capital city turned into a fatal confrontation that evening.Anjel and his brother Michael, both students in Dehradun for over a year, were stopped and taunted by a group of men who allegedly referred to them in derogatory terms. When Anjel calmly stood his ground, the situation turned uglier.Michael would later tell police and friends how his brother calmly but firmly corrected them. That assertion, of identity and dignity, was met with knives. ""Soon after Anjel replied, they attacked him and his brother while hurling abuses,"" said a friend of Anjel's, who remained at the hospital through the two weeks that followed.""Anjel suffered serious injuries to his neck and spine. Michael is also injured and still in a serious condition. ""The friend requested anonymity, but his voice carried anger and disbelief. ""He was one of the calmest, friendliest people. We're all broken by what happened."" Anjel's body was flown to Agartala on Saturday, as Tripura erupted in anger. His family was assisted by Pradyot Bikram Manikya Debbarma, chairman of Tipra Motha Party and a member of the erstwhile Tripura royal family, who had been in touch with the family since the day of the incident and had supported his medical treatment.Speaking to TOI, Debbarma said on Saturday, ""It's tragic that the patriotic people of the northeast are called Chinese and attacked. Those who hurl racist slurs forget that it is because of the brave people of the northeast that China cannot enter the country. These incidents don't just hurt families. They divide our people. And when we are divided, we are vulnerable. We don't want that. We want justice.""Suraj Debbarma, state president of Youth Tipra Federation, the youth wing of Tipra Motha, who helped coordinate Anjel's last rites, said: ""People from the northeast face racial slurs and xenophobic attacks in the north regularly. But when students from north Indian states come to central institutions in the northeast, they are welcomed like fellow countrymen. We lost an innocent soul in a hate crime. That's the tragedy. ""Police said the case was registered on Dec 12 on a complaint filed by Michael Chakma, 21. Five of the six accused - including two juveniles - were apprehended on Dec 14.Senior sub-inspector Jitendra Kumar of Selaqui police station said on Sunday, ""Yagya Awasthi, the main accused, is suspected to have fled to Nepal... Two police teams have been dispatched to track him down and nab him, and a reward of Rs 25,000 has been announced. After Anjel's death, we added additional BNS sections - 103(1) (murder) and 3(5) (committing crime with common intention).""Initially, the FIR was filed under BNS sections 115(2) (voluntarily causing hurt), 118 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons), and 351(3) (criminal intimidation). On Dec 14, based on doctors' statements, sections 109 (attempt to murder) and 61 (criminal conspiracy) were added.The charges were upgraded again after Anjel's death. In his final days, friends recalled how Anjel struggled but never regained full consciousness. Protests have begun in colleges in the northeast, demanding a national law against racial hate crimes. In Dehradun, too, student organisations are beginning to speak up.","Anjel Chakma, 24, died in Dehradun hospital on Friday after fighting for his life for over 14 days.

Congress Rift Out In Open? Digvijaya Singh's Modi-RSS Praise Draws Jibes From BJP Amid CWC Meet

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Digvijaya Singh on Saturday created a stir by praising the organisational strength of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh -- a group the Congress has long opposed ideologically. Sharing a black-and-white photograph from a social media platform that showed Narendra Modi seated on the ground while BJP veteran Lal Krishna Advani sat on a chair in the background, Singh acknowledged how the RSS shapes leadership within the organisation.He pointed to the image as an example of how a grassroots worker from the RSS and Jan Sangh rose to become prime minister of the country.Posting the picture on X, the former Madhya Pradesh chief minister wrote, ""I found this image on the Quora site. It’s very impressive. How an RSS grassroots swayamsevak and Jan Sangh @BJP4India worker sat on the floor at the feet of leaders and became the state’s Chief Minister and the country’s Prime Minister. This is the power of the organisation.""But later in the day, he issued a clarification, saying, ""I support the organisation. I am against the RSS and Modi ji... You have misunderstood... I have praised 'sangathan'. I was, am, and will remain a staunch opponent of the RSS and Modi... Is it a bad thing to strengthen and praise the organisation?...""BJP leader Gaurav Vallabh, once a staunch Congress member, weighed in on Digvijaya Singh's remarks and used the moment to criticise the grand old party.Speaking to news agency ANI, he said Singh’s comments confirm that it is a ""family-owned company"".Also read: BJP attacks Gandhi-Vadra family over Kharge's treatment in presser; shares Jairam clip Vallabh said, ""Digvijay Singh is saying that the Congress party has today become a 'family-owned company' where only the person born into that family can make all the decisions...

SRINAGAR: A day after Mirwaiz Umar Farooq justified the removal of the “Chairman, All Parties Hurriyat Conference” designation from his X account as a “Hobson’s choice,” People’s Conference chairman and MLA Sajad Lone on Saturday urged people to question the Kashmir chief cleric’s “surrender in lieu of protocol and CRPF security. ”“I visited my constituency, where villagers told me that a young man was arrested for sharing a Facebook post and released after two years, while another was picked up 15 days ago merely for liking a post,” Lone said, adding that in contrast, Mirwaiz modified his X bio to receive “five-star treatment”.Accusing the Kashmiri separatist of double standards, Lone recalled how Hurriyat brass vilified him as an “agency man” after he entered mainstream politics decades ago.“There was intense militancy at the time, and how I am alive today is known only to God,” Lone said. While asserting that he does not seek public vindication, he added, “He (Mirwaiz) should apologise for what was done to me in the past. That is the least he can do.”After removing the Hurriyat chairman designation from X on Thursday, Mirwaiz said on Friday, “I was being pressured by the authorities to make changes to my X handle as Hurriyat chairman, as all constituents of the Hurriyat Conference, including the Awami Action Committee that I head, have been banned under the UAPA.”“At a time when public space and avenues of communication stand severely restricted, this platform remains among the very few means available to me to reach out to my people... Under such circumstances, it is a Hobson’s choice I was left to make,” Mirwaiz said.PDP and National Conference have backed Mirwaiz, calling the removal of bio as a personal choice and condemning the authorities for harassing Mirwaiz.Commenting on the Dec 23 HC judgment dismissing former CM Mehbooba Mufti ’s plea seeking the transfer of Kashmiri political prisoners from jails outside J&K to prisons within the UT, Lone said, “I am convinced Madam (Mehbooba Mufti) is doing drama.”The People’s Conference chief also criticised the growing incidents of harassment of Kashmiris in different parts of the country. “It is eroding the very foundations of national integration and must be treated as a matter of national security... If nothing changes, we will collectively go to Delhi and protest,” Lone said.","Mirwaiz Umar Farooq justified the removal of the “Chairman, All Parties Hurriyat Conference’ designation from his X account as a “Hobson’s choice” People’S Conference chairman and MLA Sajad Lone on Saturday urged people to question the Kashmir chief cleric.

JAMMU: A large number of protesters on Saturday gathered outside Lok Bhavan in Jammu, demanding revocation of the MBBS admission list of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Institute of Medical Excellence (SMVDIME) in Reasi district.The protesters were mostly activists of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Sangharsh Samiti, who are up in arms against 42 of the total 50 seats going to Muslim candidates.Waving flags and holding banners, around 250-300 activists shouted slogans against Jammu and Kashmir LG Manoj Sinha, who is the chairperson of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board as well as SMVDIME, as they struggled to make their way into the Lok Bhavan. A strong police contingent foiled their bid.Later, the protesters were joined by J&K BJP’s women members and several trade leaders, including president of Jammu Chamber of Commerce and Industries Arun Gupta.Talking to media persons, convener of the Sangarsh Samiti, Colonel Sukhvir Singh Mankotia, said the protest would continue “till the resolution of our genuine demands which are related to our faith”.“We are not against students of any particular religion. We just want the seats in the medical college to be reserved for Hindu students alone,” he said, adding that the selected Muslim students be transferred to other colleges.The controversy erupted after seats for the inaugural MBBS batch of 50 students were filled through the NEET merit list last month. While 42 Muslim candidates, mostly from Kashmir, were selected for admission, only seven Hindu students from Jammu and one Sikh made it to the list.Meanwhile, Shiv Sena (UBT) has demanded a resolution of the dispute, saying it was possible through the joint efforts of the Centre and Omar Abdullah govt.The party’s J&K unit chief Manish Sahni, in a veiled attack on BJP, said, “Those who are fanning the flames of agitation from behind the scenes are largely responsible for the dispute. Even when Articles 370 and 35A were abrogated in J&K in 2019, no interest was shown in amending the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University Act to prioritise Hindus.”He also demanded that Hindus should be granted minority status in J&K.",Protests outside Jammu Lok Bhavan against MBBS admission list of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Institute of Medical Excellence. Around 250-300 activists shouted slogans against Jammu and Kashmir LG Manoj Sinha. They are up in arms against 42 of the total 50 seats going to Muslim candidates.

'If Pakistan Comes in Dowry...': Rajnath Singh Recalls The Humorous Side of Atal Bihari Vajpayee

India's beloved former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee remained unmarried his entire life, but there was a time when he was proposed to by a woman, a Pakistani woman to be precise.On the late prime minister's 101st birth anniversary on Thursday, defence minister Rajnath Singh narrated the anecdote, recalling Vajpayee's repartee and sense of humour.Singh recalled that during Vajpayee's visit to Lahore, a Pakistani woman reporter proposed to him, inspired by his speech.""I would like to share one incident. Inspired by his speech, a Pakistan i reporter said she was ready to marry him, but sought ceding of Jammu and Kashmir to Pakistan in Mehr,"" Singh said.Atalji, with a smile on his face, said, 'Madam, I am ready to marry you, but in return, I want Pakistan as dowry,"" Singh said, drawing laughter and applause from the audience.Vajpayee definitely had a way with his words. He was admired for his oratory skills across parties and was an accomplished poet known for his patriotic and humanist compositions.Once, when a supporter urged him to remain ""atal"" (unshakeable), Vajpayee quipped back playfully, with, ""Atal toh hoon, lekin Bihari bhi hoon!"" (“I am Atal, but I am also a Bihari!”).Vajpayee travelled to Lahore by bus in 1999 and embraced Pakistan’s then prime minister Nawaz Sharif, a gesture that came to symbolise hope for better ties between the two neighbours.However, the bonhomie did not last long. Just months later, the Pakistan Army carried out a covert operation to send troops into the Kargil sector of Jammu and Kashmir, triggering a limited conflict that Pakistan ultimately lost.Rashtra Prerna Sthal was inaugurated by PM Modi on Thursday and has been developed as a landmark national memorial and inspirational complex of enduring national significance. Constructed at an approximate cost of Rs 230 crore and spread across an expansive area of 65 acres.","'If Pakistan Comes in Dowry...': Rajnath Singh Recalls The Humorous Side of Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

AGRA: Back in his hometown in Agra’s Bah to a grand reception on Saturday after receiving the prestigious Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Bal Puraskar from President Droupadi Murmu in Delhi, Ajay Raj Nishad (9), who on July 25 saved father Vir Bhan from the jaws of a large crocodile in the Chambal, said, “I was afraid for my life too. But at that moment, the only thing that came to my mind was how to save my dad.”On that July afternoon, armed with only a long stick, the thin and diminutive 9-year-old boy struck the predator’s eye, forcing it to release his father and retreat back into the waters. And the child’s act of bravery was not just noticed by Bah’s residents, but it also went right up to the corridors of power in the national capital.In Delhi, inspired by his brief interaction with PM Narendra Modi at the award ceremony, the Class IV stud-ent, while dedicating the honour to his grandmother, Ratna Devi, said, “I want to join defence forces and serve the nation in the future... I want to protect my country the way I protected my father.”The award honours extraordinary accomplishments in various categories. Ajay was awarded in the category of ‘bravery’.His father, Vir Bhan, told TOI: “I’m a small-time labourer and also rear a few goats. On July 25, I, along with my children — Ajay and my daughter — took our goats out for grazing. It was around 2pm, I felt thirsty and went to fetch water from the river.To my horror, a full-grown crocodile moved towards me and before I could react, it grab-bed my right leg and tried to pull me into the water.”“Ajay quickly picked up a long stick and hit the crocodile at least 15 times. But it had little impact on the reptile. Then he struck the crocodile in the eye... It all happened within a few seconds. I thought that I was gone that day. I am alive today only because of my 9-year-old son,” Vir said, showing the months-old scar on his leg. The 37-year-old added that he had lost his wife a few years ago and his children were being raised by their grandmother.Back home, Ajay has become a local hero with people from neighbouring villages streaming in to catch a glimpse of him. Fatehpur Sikri MP Rajkumar Chahar also met the child and awarded him Rs 51,000.","Ajay Raj Nishad, 9, saved father Vir Bhan from the jaws of a large crocodile in the Chambal on July 25.

NEW DELHI: BJP Saturday seized upon the disclosure made by Sam Pitroda, head of the overseas wing of the party and part of Nehru-Gandhi family's inner circle, that Congress is a member of the George Soros-linked Global Progressive Alliance and that Rahul Gandhi is part of its presidium saying that it fully explains why the LoP has become the permanent spokesperson of anti-India global forces within Indian politics.At a presser, BJP s Sudhanshu Trivedi pointed to Pitroda's remarks to a channel confirming Congress's membership of the global conglomerate of left-leaning parties with links to the controversial billionaire hedge fund operator, and said that it has confirmed what BJP had maintained about real cause of Rahul's frequent foreign visits.Pitroda was responding to a question about Rahulchoosing to visit Germany and skipping the passage of the legislation for substituting MNREGA. Pitroda justified Rahul's absence by saying it was necessary because of Congress's membership of GPA.Trivedi flagged Pitroda's answer to say that it speaks about priorities of Congress.""If Pitroda and Congress do not care about this, then they must answer whom do they care or?""The RS MP referred to Soros's statements against Modi govt and his mission of regime change to ask: ""Rahul travels abroad, but why does he always meet anti-India organisations and anti-India individuals? Why does he never meet India-supporting institutions, India-friendly think tanks, industry leaders, parliamentarians, or thought leaders? Congress must answer this before the nation.""Trivedi said that on one hand, Rahul objected to not getting a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, but during his Germany visit he shared the stage of the Friedrich Ebert Stiftung an organisation declared illegal by Russia and expressed anti-India statements.Trivedi remarked that even before this, Sonia Gandhi was found to be the co-chairman of Forum for Democratic Liberties Asia Pacific, and even today, she holds that post. ""This organisation was also funded by George Soros"".""When Pitroda was asked what connection the Global Progressive Alliance has with Congress, he reveals that Rahul Gandhi is a member of its presidium, and Sam Pitroda is also its member."" Trivedi said that Pitroda has claimed that it is an alliance of democracies of 110 countries. He said that a question to Sam Pitroda and senior Congress netas is: which 110 countries in the world have stable democracies?""There are 190 countries, of which 57 are Muslim-majority where none have stable democracies. Apart from this, there are 30-40 countries that have monarchies, and if these are excluded, number of democratic countries falls below 100. In such situation, question arises under the cover of democracy, what is this group of countries that appears to attack India's foundation?""

Shimla Hospital Assault: Doctors’ Strike Cripples OPDs, Surgeries Across Himachal Pradesh

SHIMLA: Healthcare services, except emergency care, were disrupted across govt hospitals in Himachal Pradesh on Saturday after doctors went on indefinite strike, demanding the immediate reinstatement of Dr Raghav Nirula, who was sacked for assaulting a patient at Shimla's Indira Gandhi Medical College (IGMC) on Dec 22.There's a video of Nirula brutally thrashing the patient, who is also seen kicking him while lying in bed, but RDA says Nirula's side of the story hasn't been considered and the termination is unjust.RDA president Dr Sohail Sharma called Nirula's termination a ""humiliation of the medical fraternity"". Doctors will not resume work until govt reverses the decision, he said. ""We accept that there was misconduct, for which the doctor was suspended within six hours. However, terminating him within 48 hours based on the disciplinary committee's report is not justified,"" Dr Sharma said.Patients and their attendants visiting IGMC and Atal Institute of Medical Super Specialities (AIMSS) at Chamiyana, in Shimla, faced hardship due to doctors' absence. Several surgeries scheduled for Saturday had to be postponed.Health and family welfare minister Col Dhani Ram Shandil (retd) said the issue would be resolved soon.He added that he would call the doctors for discussions once the CM returned from Delhi. ""I always say doctors should not let anger take over. If they had quietly met the chief minister and apologised, saying it happened in a moment of passion, perhaps the entire matter could have been resolved,"" he said.The minister assured that steps were being taken to ensure patients did not face inconvenience. Emergency services would continue as usual, and reports were being compiled on doctors attending duty, he added.Jagat Ram (70), a resident of Gadakufar, in Theog tehsil of Shimla district, said his prostate surgery scheduled at AIMSS-Chamiyana on Saturday was postponed. ""Doctors advised me not to eat anything after 11 pm yesterday. But this morning, I was told the surgery could not be performed until the strike ends,"" he said.The directorate of medical education and research issued SOPs to ensure uninterrupted emergency healthcare services.",Healthcare services disrupted across govt hospitals in Himachal Pradesh.

NEW DELHI: A CWC meeting to map out the party's programmes to corner govt was overshadowed by inner turmoil after senior neta Digvijaya Singh praised the organisational strength of the RSS-BJP, citing how it enabled PM Modi 's rise from the grassroots to the top.Singh's remarks, made on social media timed with the meeting, appeared aimed at highlighting the need for organisational reforms within Congress . The post delighted BJP and raised eyebrows within the party, as Singh lauded the RSS-BJP system for allowing a ground-level worker to rise to CM and PM.At the CWC meeting, the former MP CM rued ""over-centralisation"" in Congress and pushed for decentralisation in the presence of top leadership, remarks that observers read with his X post in which he had said Rahul can do it but it is not easy to ""convince"" him.The post featured a 1990s photograph of Modi sitting on the ground while senior BJP netas, including L K Advani, sat on chairs at a meeting. Singh wrote that it was ""very impressive"" how an RSS volunteer and Jana Sangh-BJP worker rose to the highest offices, calling it the ""strength of organisation"". In another take, Singh warned that there are ""sleeper cells"" in the party, which need to be identified.BJP seized on the comments to target Congress leadership. Spokesman Sudhanshu Trivedi said BJP's system recognises a ""gudri ke laal"" like Modi, while Congress focuses on ""Jawahar ke laal"".He said BJP's working style allows people connected to the ground to rise through talent and organisational support.Targeting Rahul, Trivedi said Singh was not the first to question his understanding, recalling former US President Barack Obama's description of Rahul in his memoir as having a ""nervous, uninformed quality"". He said while Modi rose from the bottom and took BJP to the top, Congress' ""top-down"" leadership was taking the party downward.As his comments triggered a storm, Singh clarified that he had merely praised the organisational strength of Sangh Parivar. ""I was, am and will be a trenchant critic of the RSS and Modi,"" he said, asking whether strengthening an organisation was a bad thing.In the CWC meeting, sources said Singh criticised govt's bid to undo decentralisation under MGNREGA through changes in the law and pressed for decentralisation within Congress. He complained that district and state chiefs were appointed by AICC and questioned why decisions taken at Udaipur Chintan Shivir, including setting up an election management department, had not been implemented.","Digvijay Singh's remarks appeared aimed at highlighting the need for organisational reforms within Congress.

Bangladesh Unrest: Another Hindu Man Lynched; Police Claim Extortion Bid





LONDON: A protest by Hindus over the lynching of Dipu Das and general persecution of Hindus in Bangladesh outside the Bangladesh high commission in London was met with a counter-protest by Khalistanis on Saturday.More than 500 protesters, mostly Bangladeshi and Indian-origin Hindus shocked by the brutal lynching of garment factory worker Dipu Chandra Das on Dec 18 in Mymensingh, joined the protest and shouted “Hindus Lives Matter”.They carried placards calling for justice for Das, for minorities to be saved, and raising the incarceration of Hindu monk Chinmoy Krishna Das.A digital van drove around with flashing images that read “Hindus have right to live.”The protest, organised by Bengali Hindu Adarsha Saangha (UK), was peaceful. Protesters stood behind barriers, on the opposite side of the road to the mission.Then around 10 men arrived directly in front of the high commission holding yellow Khalistani flags, shouting anti-India and anti-Hindu slogans, and praising the recently assassinated extremist Sharif Osman Hadi . Police then arrived to keep the two sides apart.One of the organisers, Prajjwal Biswas, from West Bengal, said, “I don’t know why Khalistanis are protesting as this is not their cause.They are trying to instigate us.”Bangladesh-born Shuchishmita, whose wider family still live in Bangladesh, said, “The persecution of Hindus in Bangladesh is something that has been going on for centuries and no media speaks about it. I am here to ask for justice for the Hindu community. We shouldn’t tolerate what is happening.”Vikram Banerjee, a British PIO whose family migrated from then East Pakistan to India, said: “We want India and the UK to take assertive action.

UDAIPUR: A manager at a private IT company alleged that she was gang-raped by her company's CEO and an executive head's husband in a moving car, the city police said Wednesday. The manager alleged that the woman executive head was also present in the vehicle when the gang-rape and molestation occurred. All three accused were detained and questioned Wednesday.The crime allegedly took place in the city's Sukher area on Dec 20, during what was supposed to be a celebratory outing for the company CEO's birthday.According to the survivor's statement, she attended the CEO's birthday and New Year party, which began at a hotel in Shobhagpura around 9pm and continued until nearly 1:30am.

Delhi’s Air Pollution Gets Attention, But Most Indian Cities Are As Bad Or Worse | I Witness

NEW DELHI: An FIR was registered on Thursday against Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) functionaries Saurabh Bharadwaj, Sanjeev Jha and Adil Ahmad Khan for allegedly outraging the religious feelings of Christians.The FIR was filed on the complaint of a lawyer after the party posted a video on its official social media accounts on Dec 17 and 18, featuring a skit performed at Connaught Place. According to the complainant, the skit depicts Santa Claus in a humorous and derogatory manner.The controversy stems from the scenes in which a person dressed as Santa is shown collapsing on the street and is used as a ""prop"" to seemingly deliver a political message. The complainant alleged that the AAP functionaries mocked Santa by showing CPR being performed on him — ""a direct insult"" to the sanctity of St Nicholas and Christmas.BJP called it an ""indecent and objectionable act"" and ""a mockery of religious faith"".Denying the allegations, Bharadwaj said the skit helped take the issue of Delhi's air pollution to the masses, thus putting both the city and Union govts under pressure.The complainant further alleged that the actions were deliberate and malicious as they coincided with the final days of Advent. A case was registered under Sections 299, 302, and 3(5) of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) that pertain to deliberate acts intended to outrage religious feelings, with common intention.The FIR states that the collective actions of Bharadwaj, a former minister; Jha, the Burari MLA; and Khan, a national executive member of AAP, also threaten communal harmony in the city.The complainant furnished AAP's Instagram handle and a Facebook link to the video as primary evidences.Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva said, ""Such conduct is not befitting of any socially responsible individual. Those who work as public representatives in the political arena have an obligation to maintain their seriousness and dignity.""AAP alleged that the FIR was part of a broader pattern of BJP intimidating opposition functionaries using Enforcement Directorate (ED), Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and now Delhi Police. ""Their propaganda is being exposed, so they are scared. We need to expose them more and scare them further. BJP workers are now donning the mask of Christians,"" Bharadwaj, AAP Delhi unit president, said.The party also claimed that BJP's objections over issues like this have been selective. ""Caps of individuals dressed as Santa were recently yanked off in Lajpat Nagar and they were threatened, abused and chased away. However, the religious sentiment of no Christian worker of BJP was hurt in that case,"" said Bharadwaj.","Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) functionaries Saurabh Bharadwaj, Sanjeev Jha and Adil Ahmad Khan are accused of outraging the religious feelings of Christians.

Amit Shah’s 'Tamil Apology' In Focus As Stalin Speaks Tamil Without Apology In Bihar

(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: People's Democratic Party (PDP) chief Mehbooba Mufti on Friday lost her cool with a journalist who asked her to speak in Urdu instead of Kashmiri, which the former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister was using at the time.As soon as she began her press conference in Kashmiri at the PDP headquarters in Srinagar, a journalist asked her to speak in Urdu.“Do you want a translation? Why? Translate it. Why don’t you ask Stalin to speak in English or Urdu?” Mufti snapped, referring to Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin, who speaks only Tamil, his native language.She further urged Kashmiri journalists to “show some respect” for their language.“This is the only thing that is left now, so respect the Kashmiri language a little,” the former chief minister said, before continuing her address in her mother tongue.Mufti also spoke about the lynching of two Hindu youths in separate incidents in neighbouring Bangladesh, drawing a parallel with the ""intolerant"" situation in India.“The intolerance in the entire country has increased. Lynchings are taking place.What is happening in Bangladesh pains us, but those who criticise it remain mute spectators when lynchings take place here,” she told reporters.The PDP chief further urged the Jammu and Kashmir government to send ministerial teams to various states to ensure the ""safety"" of Kashmiris living there.""Our government should send a ministerial team to every state and especially to Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, and Haryana, where most such incidents take place,"" she said.Mufti's remark came in the wake of an alleged assault on a shawl seller from the Union territory in Uttarakhand. She also took credit for the arrest of the accused.""I immediately put out a tweet and tagged the Uttarakhand DGP, seeking his intervention. That is why the accused was arrested. There are still some officers in the police who respond. But three incidents took place in 72 hours? In Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Haryana.

Putin 'TEASES' Zelensky; Offers Ukraine Land Captured By Russian Troops But Not Donbas | Report





Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Friday that he will meet US President Donald Trump in Florida over the weekend, as diplomatic efforts continue to bring an end to the war between Russia and Ukraine.Speaking to reporters, Zelenskyy said the discussions on Sunday will focus on security guarantees for Ukraine. He said negotiators are close to finalising a proposed 20-point peace framework, which “is about 90% ready.”The upcoming talks come as Washington leads a broad diplomatic initiative aimed at stopping Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which began on February 24, 2022. Progress has been difficult due to major disagreements between Kyiv and Moscow over key conditions for ending the conflict.Zelenskyy said his announcement followed a “good conversation” on Thursday with US special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, the US president’s son-in-law.Earlier in the week, Zelenskyy said Ukraine would consider pulling its forces out of parts of the eastern industrial region if Russia does the same. Under his proposal, the area would become a demilitarised zone overseen by international monitors.Also read: 'Terrorist scum': Why Trump ordered US strikes on ISIS in Nigeria — what it means Moscow has not signaled acceptance of such a plan. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Thursday that negotiations were showing “slow but steady progress,” but Russia continues to press its own demands, reported AP.The Kremlin insists that Ukraine surrender the territory it still controls in the Donbas, a demand Kyiv has rejected. Russian forces currently occupy most of Luhansk and roughly 70% of Donetsk, the two regions that make up the Donbas.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that contacts between Russian and US officials are ongoing following a recent meeting in Florida between Russian presidential envoy Kirill Dmitriev and US representatives. “It was agreed upon to continue the dialogue,” Peskov said.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he will meet US President Donald Trump in Florida over the weekend.

He claims many places were locked, silent, or had no children inside.One location shown is called “Quality Learing Center,” where the word “learning” appears misspelled. In an Instagram clip, Nick Shirley asks a person nearby what they think about the center. He then says the daycare received $1.9 million this year and was supposed to have 99 children.The person responds,“I haven’t seen any kids. I’ve been here since 2017.”Nick Shirley later captioned the post,“Want to become a multimillionaire without doing anything?

Clavicular addresses Cybertruck incident as DramaAlert names alleged victim @riicanx





A short livestream clip pushed streamer Clavicular into the center of a storm. In the video, a man lies on the hood of Clavicular’s Tesla Cybertruck while filming and teasing him. Moments later, the truck moves. The man slides off and disappears from view. Someone off camera screams, “Oh my God,” and cries as the stream cuts out.Days after the clip spread online, a new claim surfaced about who that man might be. DramaAlert said the person is an Instagram influencer with close to a million followers. The claim added fuel to the backlash, especially as Clavicular’s Kick channel was banned. Police have not confirmed the person’s identity or condition. That lack of answers keeps the focus on what happened, what was said on stream, and what comes next.According to DramaAlert’s tweet shared on Saturday, December 27, the man seen on the hood was identified as Instagram user @riicanx, who has about 886,000 followers. The account is public and shows 29 posts. No new post appeared after the incident. DramaAlert also said the user once had a Kick account, which is now banned.Law enforcement has not verified this identity, and no update on the man’s health has been released.The viral clip is about 23 seconds long. It shows the man stretched across the hood, filming himself. An off-camera voice tells Clavicular to drive to shake him off. The truck starts moving. The man slides to the side and then vanishes from frame. Right after, a voice screams, “Oh my God,” followed by crying, and the livestream ends.After the clip spread, Clavicular spoke during another livestream. He described fear and confusion and said he could not see clearly. In the surfaced clip, he says:“You saw that? Bro, they were surrounding our car… Yeah, exactly, I can’t see sh*t. Well, that’s why… when you’re afraid… Well, I don’t know what’s going on.”When someone off camera calls it “self-defense,” Clavicular responds:“You don’t know, there’s armed people surrounding my car. Yeah, and they’re armed. They all have pistols. I see the print popping through their sweatpants when they’re pressing us. I see the guy’s… I see a pistol…”The man on the hood has not made a public statement. With no police confirmation yet, the case sits in a gray area. Still, the fallout is real. Clavicular’s Kick ban remains, and many viewers are calling for further action while others wait for verified updates.Also Read: Viral Video Shows Clavicular And N3on Attacked With Red Liquid As Past Crash Livestream Resurfaces Amid Ongoing Kick Ban","A short livestream clip pushed streamer Clavicular into the center of a storm.

US President Donald Trump in his Christmas message on Thursday (local time) launched a sharp attack on his critics, calling them ""sleazebags"" and accusing them of having close ties with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein before ""dropping him like a dog"" and then ""blaming Trump. "" He also fired shots at Democrats and ""fake media coverage"" further warning ""enjoy what may be your last Merry Christmas.""Sharing a post on Truth Social, Trump posted, ""Merry Christmas to all, including the many Sleazebags who loved Jeffrey Epstein, gave him bundles of money, went to his Island, attended his parties, and thought he was the greatest guy on earth, only to 'drop him like a dog' when things got too HOT.""He claimed these critics ""falsely claimed they had nothing to do with him, didn’t know him, said he was a disgusting person, and then blame, of course, President Donald J Trump.""Trump further went on to assert that he was ""actually the only one who did drop Epstein, and long before it became fashionable to do so.""The US President further alleged that those who would be named in the ""ongoing Radical Left Witch Hunt"" would largely turn out to be Democrats.He said, ""When their names get brought out in the ongoing Radical Left Witch Hunt (plus one lowlife 'Republican,' Massie!), and it is revealed that they are Democrats all, there will be a lot of explaining to do, much like there was when it was made public that the Russia, Russia Hoax was a fictitious story - a total Scam - and had nothing to do with 'TRUMP.'""He also criticised the media coverage on Epstien files singling out The New York Times.""The Failing New York Times, among many others, was forced to apologize for their bad and faulty Election 'Reporting,' even to the point of losing many subscribers due to their highly inaccurate (FAKE!) coverage.

But sadly, that’s the way it is in the World of Corrupt Democrat Politics!!! Enjoy what may be your last Merry Christmas!"" he added.The post comes amid renewed scrutiny of Epstein's links with powerful figures, alongside ongoing political and legal debates over the release of documents.Trump and Epstein were friends for several years, but the MAGA leader has stated that they fell out around 2004, years before Epstein was first arrested. Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.Meanwhile, the US Justice Department (DOJ) has released nearly 30,000 additional pages of documents linked to Epstein, marking the largest disclosure so far in the long-running investigation.The newly released files contain multiple references to Trump, including an email from a prosecutor noting flights Trump took on Epstein’s private jet during the 1990s.In a response to the latest files released, the DOJ said that some of the latest documents released from the Epstein files contained ""untrue and sensationalist claims"" against Trump, which were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 US election.The latest disclosure follows criticism of an earlier tranche of records, some of which were briefly removed from the DOJ's online portal over concerns about protecting victims’ identities. The files were later restored after authorities determined that no victims were depicted in the disputed material.The newly released material also included hundreds of video and audio files, as well as surveillance footage from August 2019, the month Epstein was found dead in his jail cell while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.","US President Donald Trump in his Christmas message on Thursday (local time) launched a sharp attack on his critics.

Snowfall hits New York, airports and roads hardest

Emergency declarations and travellers caught out





A powerful winter storm sweeping across the US Northeast and Great Lakes disrupted peak post-Christmas travel, grounding thousands of flights and prompting emergency declarations in several states. Snow and ice battered major transport hubs from Friday into Saturday, leaving travellers stranded at airports and forcing authorities to urge people to stay off the roads during one of the busiest travel windows of the year.By early Saturday evening, more than 9,000 domestic flights across the United States had been cancelled or delayed, according to flight-tracking site FlightAware, as per Reuters.The worst disruption was concentrated around the New York metropolitan area, with John F. Kennedy International, LaGuardia and Newark Liberty airports all heavily affected. Airlines including American, United and JetBlue confirmed they had waived change fees for passengers whose plans were disrupted by the weather.New York City, New Jersey and large parts of the wider Northeast were placed under states of emergency as snow mixed with sleet created treacherous driving conditions. Officials warned that icy roads and reduced visibility posed serious risks, particularly for those attempting long-distance holiday journeys.New York City recorded its most significant snowfall in several years, with 4.3 inches covering Central Park by early Saturday — the first time more than four inches had fallen since January 2022. Areas north and east of the city, including parts of Long Island, Connecticut and the Hudson Valley, saw higher totals, while Belleayre Mountain in the Catskills recorded the region’s heaviest snowfall at 13 inches.Despite earlier forecasts predicting even heavier snow, the reduced totals were still enough to cause major disruption. Around 20 per cent of departures from JFK and LaGuardia were cancelled by midday Saturday, with a further 15 per cent delayed. Newark Liberty Airport issued repeated snow warnings, cautioning passengers to expect ongoing disruption.New York Governor Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency across more than half the state, while acting New Jersey Governor Tahesha Way issued a similar order. Way warned that the storm would “cause dangerous road conditions and impact holiday travel”, urging people to avoid unnecessary journeys and allow crews to clear roads safely.At street level, city workers were deployed across New York, clearing snow from pavements and roads in areas such as Times Square. Some visitors embraced the rare winter scene. Tourists from North Carolina and West Virginia described the snowfall as unexpected but memorable, even as travel delays mounted.","Snow and ice battered major transport hubs from Friday into Saturday.

Empty childcare centres and millions paid: YouTuber Nick Shirley's investigation sparks outrage over alleged Minnesota welfare fraud,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/empty-childcare-centres-and-millions-paid-youtuber-nick-shirleys-investigation-sparks-outrage-over-alleged-minnesota-welfare-fraud/articleshow/126209085.cms,"



Minnesota was plunged into national controversy after explosive claims emerged suggesting that as much as $8 billion in taxpayer money may have been lost to large-scale welfare fraud, following a viral investigation by YouTuber Nick Shirley.The video has sparked widespread outrage, accusing state agencies of ignoring glaring warning signs while billions of pounds allegedly flowed through childcare, transport and healthcare programmes that existed largely on paper.The investigation, published online and rapidly shared across social media, shows Shirley travelling across Minnesota to confront what he describes as a sprawling network of fraudulent welfare operations. In the footage, he questions officials, inspects licensed facilities and challenges business owners over payments received from publicly funded programmes.At one point, Shirley claims: 'This could be the largest fraud scandal in US history,' alleging that state and federal funds were funnelled into businesses that showed little or no evidence of operating.Much of the video focuses on childcare centres licensed to care for dozens of children but which appeared empty during repeated daytime visits. Shirley is joined by a local investigator identified only as David, who says his suspicions grew after years of passing the same locations. 'I would drive by these childcare centres in the middle of the day and there were never any kids there,' he says. 'That's when I started asking, where are these children?'A major focus of the investigation is Minnesota's childcare assistance system.According to Shirley's claims, some centres were paid hundreds of thousands of pounds, and in certain cases millions, each year despite showing no visible signs of operation. Standing outside one Minneapolis building, Shirley says: 'Between these two childcare centres alone, they are pulling in roughly £2.4 million ($3 million) a year, and there are no children. ' Footage shows locked doors, darkened windows and signs advertising long opening hours, with no activity inside.The video also highlights alleged abuse within non-emergency medical transport services and home healthcare programmes. One address in St Paul is shown housing more than a dozen registered healthcare companies. 'Every door is another healthcare business,' Shirley says, adding that none would clearly explain what services they provided or how much they charged.The allegations have triggered fierce political backlash, with Governor Tim Walz and senior state officials repeatedly referenced throughout the investigation. Shirley and his sources claim authorities were aware of suspicious activity but failed to intervene. 'The govt knows,' David says in the video. 'They're the ones writing the cheques.' He points to Minnesota law requiring public employees to report suspected fraud, suggesting that a failure to act could amount to serious misconduct.During one street interview, a local resident reacts angrily after being told how much money a nearby centre allegedly received. 'That's disgusting,' he says. 'They're stealing from everyone.'As clips from the investigation continue to circulate online, public anger has intensified. Supporters argue Shirley's work exposes deep failures in oversight and enforcement, while critics caution that the allegations must be tested through audits, court proceedings and official investigations.The video itself acknowledges the risks involved. At one point, Shirley warns: 'We have to be careful because these people are dangerous,' as he continues confronting alleged operators on camera.So far, state authorities have not addressed every claim raised in the investigation, but the scale and detail of the allegations have ensured the issue will not fade quietly. Whether the true figure reaches £6.3 billion remains unproven, but the fallout has already shaken public confidence.What is clear is that Nick Shirley's investigation has ignited a fierce debate about accountability, oversight and the safeguarding of taxpayer money, leaving Minnesotans demanding answers to one question that echoes throughout the footage: where did the money really go?","Investigation by YouTuber Nick Shirley has sparked widespread outrage.

"School uniforms, binoculars and more: Jeffrey Epstein’s Amazon purchases revealed in DOJ files",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/school-uniforms-binoculars-and-more-jeffrey-epsteins-amazon-purchases-revealed-in-doj-files/articleshow/126208809.cms,"



A newly released tranche of documents from the US Department of Justice has pulled back the curtain on a deeply unsettling aspect of Jeffrey Epstein ’s private life: his online shopping history.The records, part of a broader release tied to the federal investigation into the disgraced financier, detail thousands of Amazon purchases that investigators say raise serious red flags about his behaviour in the years before his death.As reported by the New York Post and X posts the receipts, dated between 2014 and 2019, list more than 1,000 items purchased through Epstein’s Amazon account. The disclosures come as the DOJ continues to review over a million documents connected to Epstein.According to CNN, roughly 750,000 files have already been examined and released, while about 700,000 more remain under review. The department has said it could take “a few more weeks” before the process is complete.Among the most disturbing items revealed in the newly released files were schoolgirl uniforms, including pleated skirts and full-body dresses. The clothing was ordered in 2018 and shipped directly to Epstein’s Manhattan residence.The reported list also contained objects like a $61.50 Sonic prostate massager, which he ordered two days after Christmas in 2018.The purchases are documented in the DOJ files and, according to the New York Post, reflect patterns experts say are consistent with Epstein’s predatory conduct.Epstein’s Amazon history also included items such as binoculars and other objects that, taken together, paint what psychologists describe as a troubling behavioural profile.As per reports, he also got bottles of Vagifirm, an herbal supplement that promises “increased lubrication and libido” and firmer breasts, for $64.95, according to the records.Records show he also picked up an FBI costume, a pair of Israel Defense Forces combat pants, several sauna hats, and four books by Vladimir Nabokov, including Lolita, the controversial novel centered on pedophilia.Reviewing the shopping list, relational trauma psychologist Desiree Nazarian told the New York Post that Epstein’s purchases were not incidental but deeply revealing.“The presence of these child-coded items alongside these sexual tools is so clinically alarming,” she said.Nazarian described the list as a reflection of “predatory dynamics 101,” adding that it pointed to a personality driven by domination and capable of causing harm to others. “Everything on this list is really common in predatory profiles. It’s marked by coercion, entitlement, dominance and control of narrative,” she further said.Epstein, a registered sex offender, died in a New York jail cell in August 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. His death halted further courtroom proceedings, but the steady release of court records and investigative material has continued to shed new light on the scope of his actions and behaviour.","Records from the US Department of Justice show more than 1,000 items purchased through Jeffrey Epstein’s Amazon account.

Security lapse? Lawsuit targets Secret Service over protesters near Donald Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/security-lapse-lawsuit-targets-secret-service-over-protesters-near-donald-trump/articleshow/126209046.cms,"Trump Tells Pam Bondi-led DOJ To Release Names Of All Dems In Epstein Files & ‘EMBARRASS’ Them





A dinner reservation in Washington usually comes with a waitlist — not protest chants and security questions. But when President Donald Trump sat down at a high-end DC steakhouse, Code Pink protesters were already in place, raising fresh alarms about whether the Secret Service is protecting the president… or leaving the door wide open.Judicial Watch filed a lawsuit on December 18 in Washington DC Federal Court demanding that the US government release all internal communications among USSS officials concerning Code Pink protestors at Joe’s Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab in Washington DC on September 9, when President Trump was shouted down by demonstrators, New York Post reported.The lawsuit seeks “all internal emails and text messages among USSS officials in the Presidential Protective Division regarding the presence of Code Pink protestors” and “all emails sent between USSS officials and any email account ending in @codepink.org.” According to court papers, the govt allegedly ignored a Dec. 9 deadline under the Freedom of Information Act to provide the requested material.On Sept. 9, Trump dined with Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth at the restaurant. None of the protesters were accused of violence, but Judicial Watch had spent three months trying to obtain information on how they secured advance notice of the President’s closely held movements at an event intended to demonstrate that the city was thriving under new federal security protection.Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch said, “I’m just really concerned about the president’s safety.” He added, “He was almost killed twice supposedly under the protection of the Secret Service and then they walked him into a potentially dangerous ambush.” He also warned, “These people were allowed to get within arm’s length of the sitting president with knives and who knows what else in the restaurant available to them.”Video of the incident showed members of the President’s security detail speaking into hand-held microphones after the disruption began and as the President approached his table. The President himself pointed in an indication that the nearby protesters should be removed. The demonstrators shouted “Free DC. Free Palestine. Trump is the Hitler of our time!”Former FBI Assistant Director Chris Swecker described the episode as “an unbelievable security lapse.” He said, “I can’t believe they would let random people sit in that close proximity to them. That’s crazy. That’s like’s like the days when Abraham Lincoln would ride down Pennsylvania Avenue in his coach and buggy with no protection.”Fitton fears that anyone armed with key information about the President’s movements could potentially harm the commander in chief. Trump survived two assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign – one in Butler, Pennsylvania in July, and the other in September at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida – and a subsequent House task force found inexperienced personnel “did not clearly understand the delineation of their responsibilities. ” Judicial Watch is also seeking Secret Service documents in connection with those close calls.In a separate incident, the Secret Service failed to detect a guest who brought a Glock handgun onto the Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Va. while the President was there. “The US Secret Service takes the safety and security of our sites very seriously and there are redundant security layers built into every one,” an agency spokesperson said at the time, adding that the person with the gun was never in close proximity to the President. The agency said all guests at the restaurant were screened before Trump arrived. It declined comment on the lawsuit.","Judicial Watch filed a lawsuit on December 18 in Washington DC Federal Court demanding that the US government release all internal communications.

'Racist and it ...

Podcaster and political commentator Brad Polumbo slammed White far-rightist Nick Fuentes over his remarks against ""anchor baby"" Vivek Ramaswamy and called him ""racist.""Fuentes, in his recent podcast, called out Indian-origin Republican leader Ramaswamy and asked him to ""go back to India"" and even asked people in Ohio to not vote for him as he is standing for Governorship.""Nick Fuentes, the far right extremist and kind of rising sensation, at least online. Hard to know how much it's translating to the real world, but he is going viral for his extreme position against Republicans in Ohio. Where you have, in Ohio you have Vivek Ramaswamy, who you'll probably remember ran for President in 2020, 2024. Of course, he's become kind of a national, a national political figure. He is a Republican. Well, he is running for governor in Ohio and looks likely to secure the nomination. And of course running against a, a Democratic front runner who is a, a Jewish woman and is very liberal because she's the, the Democratic Party's main candidate. Now, because Vivek is not white and not Christian and has had the audacity to suggest that Americans are Americans even if they're not white or not Christian or even if they don't date their ancestors back hundreds of years, he's pushed back on this.What I agree is a kind of ridiculous idea of a heritage American or citizens are above or more important or special than other Americans because my ancestors did, did this or did that. It's like you don't get a cookie,"" Polumbo said in the podcast."" You didn't do anything. In the same way you shouldn't have to pay reparations for what your ancestors did if they owned slaves. But you don't get a cookie for the fact that they helped, I don't know, build the Golden Gate Bridge or something like, I, I think American citizens are Americans and if you swear allegiance to our country and assimilate to our way of life, you should be welcome here, whether you're white or not, whether you're Christian or another, faith or no faith at all. And, and that's what Vivek believes. So Nick is going after him and attacking him in just openly racist ways against Indians. So much so that he's cheering on the Democratic candidate who is of course pro abortion, pro transitioning kids, pro all this stuff Nick says he doesn't, he, he finds evil. But, oh, you got to stop. The brown person is basically his take,"" he added.Explaining about Fuentes hatred towards Ramaswamy, he called Fuentes ""racist and it s***s"" and said that the far-right podcaster cannot claim that he truly care about America first and Republican and saving from far left Democrat insanity and all this stuff while simultaneously campaigning against America First Republicans just because of your own racism and prejudice.""There's no other explanation here, but I think it's deeply revealing of what really motivates Nick Fuentes and why it's so concerning to me that people are increasingly buying his absolute bigoted. There's no other way to describe it,"" Polumbo said.","Nick Fuentes, the far right extremist and kind of rising sensation, at least online.

The Trump administration is already unique with its two-term presidency, but it seems nothing satisfies its leader who keeps on making peculiar decisions. One of the most viral and controversial aspects of Trump's second presidency is the appointment of completely out-of-the-ordinary people to vital sectors. From the appointment of a former Fox News host as Secretary of Defence and a salon chain owner as Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs, the decisions are no longer surprising, just awaited.Recently, he appointed an Iranian-American lawyer, Mora Namdar as the Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs, with her nomination receiving approval from the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The 38-year-old is the daughter of Iranian immigrants and owns a chain of beauty salons called Bam Beauty Bar with outlets in Dallas, Fort Worth and Plano. Here's all you need to know about her.In her new role, Namdar will now oversee visas, passports, issuance and consular enforcement. She is the head of the Bureau of Consular Affairs, which manages visa adjudication, revocations, passport policy and consular services worldwide.Before her appointment to this role, Namdar served as the Senior Bureau Official for the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs from May to December 2025, leading the US foreign policy in the Middle East and North Africa (NEA).She has previously served as the acting Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs, during Trump's first term.Additionally, she founded Namdar Law PLLC, a private law practice in 2013 and was the Vice President of Legal, Compliance and Risk at the United States Agency for Global Media (USAGM) and a Senior Advisor at the U.S. Department of State.While she has a stellar resume, Namdar's net worth is not publicly disclosed.
