NEW DELHI: Congress MP and former diplomat Shashi Tharoor , leading an all-party delegation, arrived in Colombia 's Bogota on Thursday as part of a diplomatic outreach to brief global partners on India’s recent counterterrorism action, Operation Sindoor , and to reaffirm India’s firm position on, now suspended, the Indus Waters Treaty , a long-standing pact between India and Pakistan Addressing the media in Colombian capital, Tharoor highlighted India’s evolving approach to terrorism and the broader diplomatic consequences of continued crossborder threats.Speaking about the suspension of the water-sharing agreement with Pakistan, Thiruvananthapuram MP said, ""The Indus Waters Treaty was one that was offered by India to Pakistan in the early 1960s in a spirit of goodwill and harmony. In fact, those words occur in the preamble of the treaty; sadly, that goodwill has been repeatedly betrayed by the terrorist actions of the last four decades.""He added, ""Even though we have had terrorism and war inflicted on us, the treaty has remained in place, but this time our government has placed the treaty in abeyance, which means it is in effect suspended. Its operations are suspended until such time as we get satisfactory indication from Pakistan that they're prepared to conduct themselves in that spirit of goodwill that is provided for in the preamble of the treaty.Tharoor also pointed out India’s restraint over the years: ""We are very conscious that we have been a generous neighbour when it comes to the operation of the treaty. We are in an upper riparian state. We have given Pakistan very generously the waters that they are entitled to under the treaty, and we have not even used all the waters we are entitled to under the treaty. But the time for acting on the basis of goodwill unilaterally is frankly no longer with us. ..""Reacting to Colombia’s diplomatic response to India’s recent strikes on terror camps, Tharoor said, ""We were a little disappointed in the reaction of the Colombian government, which apparently expressed heartfelt condolences on the loss of lives in Pakistan after the Indian strikes, rather than sympathising with the victims of terrorism...""He further added, ""We will say to our friends in Colombia, there can be no equivalence between those who dispatch terrorists and those who resist them. There can be no equivalence between those who attack and those who defend. We are only exercising our right of self-defence, and if there is any misunderstanding here on this core, we are here to dispel any such misunderstanding. We're very happy to talk to Colombia in some detail about the circumstances. We have, as I said, very concrete proof. In fact, when this terrorist attack occurred, it was immediately claimed by an organisation called The Resistance Front, which is a unit of the Lashkar-e-Taiba base in Muridke, Pakistan... Just as Colombia has endured many terror attacks, so have we in India. We have endured a very large number of attacks for almost four decades.""Tharoor also recalled the recent terror strike that prompted India’s military response: ""India suffered a grievous terrorist attack on the 22nd of April... When this happened, of course, the world rose up to condemn the terrorist attack, but that was as far as it went. There was no action taken, not even by the country where these people had emerged from, Pakistan. Nobody was arrested, and there was no attempt at any prosecution. India decided that this kind of outrage could not go unpunished. On May 7, India chose to strike against known terror bases and launch pads.""Tharoor is leading a broad all-party parliamentary delegation touring countries in the Americas to explain India’s counterterrorism operation launched on May 7 and to counter Pakistan’s global narrative.The outreach is part of India’s diplomatic push to promote its zero-tolerance approach to terrorism.The delegation includes representatives from across the political spectrum, Congress, BJP, Shiv Sena, JMM, TDP, LJP - as well as former Indian ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu. Their visit began at the 9/11 Memorial in New York, a symbolic gesture linking global victims of terrorism and reinforcing the shared nature of the threat.Among the members are Shambhavi Chaudhary (Lok Janshakti Party), Sarfaraz Ahmed (Jharkhand Mukti Morcha), G M Harish Balayagi (Telugu Desam Party), Shashank Mani Tripathi, Tejaswi Surya, Bhubaneswar Kalita (BJP), Mallikarjun Devda (Shiv Sena), Milind Deora (Shiv Sena), and Taranjit Singh Sandhu.The all-party delegation is structured into seven groups, each led by one MP, to engage in wide-ranging discussions with governments, think tanks, and media across the region, seeking to strengthen India’s position in the global fight against terrorism.","Congress MP and former diplomat Shashi Tharoor is leading an all-party delegation to Colombia.

A frightening video has gone viral on social media, showing a furious wild rhino attacking a tourist vehicle and nearly overturning it.

The animal repeatedly tries to flip the vehicle.Few minutes later, a couple of men were seen chasing the rhino away.During the monsoon season, rhinos often leave their natural habitat seeking refugee from flooded areas and to find better grazing spots. This increases the chances of human-wildlife conflict. Many social media users have raised concerns about the safety of using open jeeps in such areas.There have been frequent rhino attacks on humans but the exact reason behind their aggression is unknown.","A wild rhino attacked a tourist vehicle in Assam, India.

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor , one of the leaders of seven all-party delegations, on Thursday (local time) expressed disappointment over Colombia's condolences for the people who lost their lives in Pakistan when India launched a counterstrike on May 7, and said that there can be no equivalence between those who attack and those who defend. He added that India was only exercising its right of self-defence.Tharoor, who is in Columbia as part of the Centre's move, has also shown the picture of Pakistani Army officials attending the funerals of terrorists after India's strike on their terror bases and said that if there is any misunderstanding the delegation is here to clear that.""We were a little disappointed in the reaction of the Colombian government, which apparently expressed heartfelt condolences on the loss of lives in Pakistan after the Indian strikes, rather than sympathising with the victims of terrorism.

World's longest hairball removed from teen's stomach at SMS Hosp,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/worlds-longest-hairball-removed-from-teens-stomach-at-sms-hosp/articleshow/121501576.cms,"Photo/Agencies

JAIPUR: The SMS Hospital doctors surgically removed a 210-centimetre-long trichobezoar (a collection of hair) from the stomach of a 14-year-old girl, a resident of Barara village in Agra district of Uttar Pradesh, on Tuesday. It is believed to be the longest trichobezoar ever recorded in the world. The previous record stood at 180 cm.The trichobezoar was entangled throughout the small intestine, which made the surgery a challenging task. Removing it in one piece was a major challenge, as breaking it could have necessitated multiple incisions in the intestines. In the operation, which lasted about two hours, and notably, no blood transfusion was required, the doctors managed to remove trichobezoar in one piece.The girl was brought to the SMS hospital with complaint of abdominal pain and vomiting for over a month. Upon examination, doctors found a hard mass in her abdomen stretching from the stomach to the navel and the upper right part of the abdomen. A CECT (Contrast Enhanced CT scan) revealed a swollen stomach containing an unusual object.The girl was diagnosed with a psychological condition known as Pica, where a person eats non-edible substances. ""She began with ingesting chalk in her school since Class 6, influenced by her peers' behaviour, and later she started eating hair. As we operated upon her, we found wooden pieces, rubber bands, pieces of stones, threads and other non-food items closely packed in the bunch of hair forming a long trichobezoar,"" said Dr Jeevan Kankaria, of surgery department at SMS Hospital,""When we measured, we found it 210 cm long, which is the world's longest trichobezoar ever removed from the stomach of a patient. We will apply for a Guinness World Record for it,"" said Kankaria, who has four Guinness World Records in surgeries.The girl is now receiving treatment in the hospital. She will be discharged soon once the doctors ensure that her condition has improved. The girl is a Class 10 student and belongs to a farmer family.","A 210-centimetre-long trichobezoar (a collection of hair) was removed from the stomach of a 14-year-old girl in Uttar Pradesh.

Poll Should national security decisions be influenced by foreign powers? No, they must be made independently Yes, if it serves long-term strategic interests

NEW DELHI: BJP MP Nishikant Dubey on Thursday claimed that the 1988 nuclear agreement between India and Pakistan was signed under pressure from the United States, during the tenure of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.Sharing what he described as a declassified letter on X, Dubey alleged that then US President Ronald Reagan had dictated the agenda of talks between New Delhi and Islamabad.“Under American pressure, we spoke to Pakistani President General Zia. The agenda for the talks was set by the US President,” Dubey posted on X.“What we understood after this letter was that Pakistan and we did the nuclear deal in 1988 under American pressure.”“Why is Congress angry? When I saw this paper, I felt ashamed,” he added, attaching a copy of the letter that he said was addressed by Reagan to Rajiv Gandhi.Dubey also accused the Congress-led government of aligning with US interests in its foreign policy decisions.“Whatever we talked to our friend Soviet Russia about on the Afghanistan problem was an American agenda. Is this the Shimla Agreement? Is the Iron Lady the mentality of slavery? Were we a sovereign nation at that time? Is Congress abusing Modi Ji to make India stronger?” he wrote.The 1988 agreement between India and Pakistan, officially known as the Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities, was signed on 31 December 1988 and came into force on 27 January 1991. It obligates both nations to annually share lists of nuclear facilities and refrain from attacking each other’s nuclear infrastructure.Dubey’s remarks come amid renewed domestic debate over foreign involvement in India-Pakistan diplomacy, particularly following the Pahalgam terror attack and India’s subsequent Operation Sindoor . He also referred to a letter reportedly written by Rajiv Gandhi to Reagan seeking mediation with Pakistan, a move he said violated the 1972 Shimla Agreement which barred third-party mediation.“It is not easy to be Gandhi,” Dubey said, asserting that Rajiv Gandhi’s request for American intervention was contrary to India’s stated diplomatic policy.Earlier, the BJP MP had posted a declassified 1971 US intelligence cable suggesting that former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had agreed to a UN ceasefire during the Bangladesh Liberation War due to international pressure. The post was aimed at countering opposition criticism of the government’s current diplomatic approach.Meanwhile, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh criticised external affairs minister S Jaishankar for remaining silent on US Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s alleged remarks about possible American mediation in India-Pakistan talks. India has since reaffirmed its longstanding stance that all issues with Pakistan, including those concerning Jammu and Kashmir, must be addressed bilaterally without foreign mediation.","BJP MP Nishikant Dubey claims 1988 nuclear agreement between India and Pakistan was signed under pressure from the United States.

"'Shashi Tharoor very much part of the family': Congress softens stance after 'clarification' post, but flags 'factual error'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shashi-tharoor-very-much-part-of-the-family-congress-softens-stance-after-clarification-post-but-flags-factual-error/articleshow/121494894.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Congress on Thursday softened its stance towards senior party leader Shashi Tharoor hours after after the MP defended his Line of Control (LoC) remark in a strongly worded post on X by saying he is ""very much part of family"".Seeking to ease internal friction, Congress general secretary Randeep Surjewala reiterated that Tharoor remains an important part of the party.""Shashi Tharoor is a senior Congress leader and very much part of the Congress family. However, what he said about the surgical strike was factually incorrect,"" Surjewala told reporters.""The Congress party only corrected the record by pointing out that the surgical strike on Pakistan and also at other places on the den of terrorists were regularly executed during Congress-led UPA government to give a befitting reply to terrorists by our armed forces and the then Congress Government,"" he added when questioned on the war of words between some Congress leaders and Tharoor.Surjewala's statement comes as Tharoor faces criticism from party colleagues over his recent remarks on surgical strikes.Tharoor, currently leading a multi-party delegation to countries including Panama and the US, had said that India conducted its first cross-border surgical strike in 2016, a claim seen by many in the party as undermining similar operations during the UPA era.Facing flak from Congress leaders such as Pawan Khera and Udit Raj, Tharoor defended himself in a strongly worded post on X from Panama City, clarifying that his remarks specifically referred to responses to terrorist attacks—not to prior wars or conflicts.""After a long and successful day in Panama, I have to wind up at midnight here with departure for Bogota, Colombia in six hours, so I don’t really have time for this — but anyway: For those zealots fulminating about my supposed ignorance of Indian valour across the LoC: in the past,"" Tharoor said in a post on X.""I was clearly and explicitly speaking only about reprisals for terrorist attacks and not about previous wars and my remarks were preceded by a reference to the several attacks that have taken place in recent years alone, during which previous Indian responses were both restrained and constrained by our responsible respect for the LoC and the IB,"" he added.The controversy erupted after Tharoor reportedly stated in Panama that India breached the LoC ""for the first time"" during the 2016 surgical strike. This prompted a sharp response from his party colleague Udit Raj, who accused Tharoor of denigrating Congress's legacy. ""How could you denigrate the golden history of Congress by saying that before PM Modi, India never crossed LoC and International border?"" Raj questioned.He went so far as to suggest Tharoor be made a ""super spokesperson of the BJP.""Pawan Khera also weighed in, posting a screenshot from Tharoor’s book, where the MP had previously criticised the Modi government for politicizing the 2016 strikes while acknowledging that the Congress had authorised several such operations in the past without publicising them.“The shameless exploitation of the 2016 'surgical strikes'... as a party election tool—something the Congress had never done—marked a particularly disgraceful dilution of the principle that national security issues require discretion and non-partisanship,” Tharoor wrote at the time.Despite the public discord, the Congress leadership has now sought to downplay the fallout. Surjewala stressed that setting the record straight should not lead to “acronyms or doubts” within the party.","Shashi Tharoor is a senior Congress leader and very much part of the Congress family.

MUMBAI: A 40-year-old man from Worli has been sentenced to four months of rigorous imprisonment after his pet husky bit his neighbour inside an apartment lift. The man, Rishab Patel, was convicted on charges of voluntarily causing hurt and negligent conduct with an animal.Judicial magistrate Suhas Bhosale, while delivering the verdict, said he would not show Patel ""too much leniency"". Referring to CCTV footage, the judge noted, ""The way in which the accused dragged his pet inside lift shows he is not compassionate towards his own pet. He did not care about the informant, his son and dragged his own pet inside the lift... the act... resulted in injury.""The victim, Ramik Shah, a resident of Alfa Apartment in Worli, was heading down from the fourth floor with his one-and-a-half-year-old son and domestic help. When the lift stopped at the third floor, Patel was standing with his dog. Shah said he requested Patel to wait, explaining that his son was cynophobic (afraid of dogs). However, Patel allegedly ignored the request and did not even allow them to exit. Instead, he dragged his dog into the lift, which bit Shah on his left forearm. After the incident, Shah, his son, and the help exited the lift, but Patel allegedly followed them and challenged Shah to ""do whatever he wanted.""Shah later sought medical treatment and filed a police complaint.During the trial, the prosecution presented oral evidence from the victim, Ramik Shah, and his domestic help, Anuj Singh, who confirmed Patel had forcibly entered the lift with the dog despite repeated requests.The defence pointed to inconsistencies, including a delay in medical treatment and the initial absence of administration of anti-rabies vaccine for the victim. However, the magistrate found the testimonies of both Shah and Singh consistent and credible. ""Only because the witness is servant of the first informant we cannot brush aside his evidence if it is otherwise trustworthy,"" he ruled. Holding Patel's actions as ""voluntary,"" the court fined him Rs 4,000 in addition to sentencing him to jail.","A 40-year-old man from Worli has been sentenced to four months of rigorous imprisonment.

The Guru said he asked for a unique dakshina in return: “I want PoK back.”General Dwivedi visited the revered seer at his Chitrakoot Ashram on Wednesday during a tour that also included the inauguration of a state-of-the-art simulator machine at Sadguru Netra Chikitsalaya, a pioneering step in medical training for eye surgeries.“This machine allows doctors to practice surgical procedures virtually before operating on real patients. There are only 4–5 such machines in India, and this is the first one in Madhya Pradesh,” said a member of the Sadguru Sewa Centre, adding that the Army Chief also observed the functioning of the facility’s operation theatres.With 140 vision centres and an equal number of surgeons operating across the network, the centre also explored possibilities of collaboration with the armed forces to extend eye care services to personnel and veterans.The Army Chief’s visit comes days after his critical leadership role in Operation Sindoor , India’s retaliatory mission against terror infrastructure in Pakistan and PoK following the Pahalgam terror attack on April 22.General Dwivedi, alongside Navy Chief Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi and Air Force Chief Marshal AP Singh, oversaw operations from the military command centre, featured in a booklet recently circulated among Indian Army personnel.India has since launched diplomatic efforts, sending multi-party MP-led delegations to key countries to underscore its zero-tolerance stance on terrorism and expose Pakistan’s role in cross-border attacks.", Spiritual leader Jagadguru Rambhadracharya bestowed the Ram Mantra Diksha upon Chief of Army Staff General Upendra Dwivedi.

BENGALURU: Karnataka's Congress government is considering sending to the President a bill that proposes reservation for Muslims in civil contracts after governor Thaawar Chand Gehlot returned it a second time, insisting it be forwarded to President Droupadi Murmu.Karnataka Transparency in Public Procurement (Amendment) Bill, 2025, provides for 4% reservation to Muslims in civil contracts up to Rs 1 crore, besides quotas for SCs, STs and OBCs (Category I and II-A) in government tenders for goods and services. It was passed by the state legislature in March. Law and parliamentary affairs minister HK Patil had planned to meet senior officials and legal experts Thursday to decide the next course of action, but that meeting was postponed.Senior officials said the government had considered challenging Gehlot's decision in court. However, constitutional experts reportedly advised against legal action, urging the government to pursue alternative routes instead. The issue is likely to be informally discussed during a meeting that CM Siddaramaiah is scheduled to chair on Friday.Gehlot had referred the bill to the President previously following objections from the BJP.The principal opposition party argued that providing reservations based on religion violates constitutional provisions and urged the governor to withhold assent.The government then re-sent the bill to Raj Bhavan without amendment but included detailed explanations justifying its stance and requesting the governor's approval. Gehlot, however, remained firm and sent it back again, reiterating reference to the President.","Karnataka Transparency in Public Procurement (Amendment) Bill, 2025, provides for 4% reservation to Muslims in civil contracts up to Rs 1 crore.

'Backstabbed from within'

Letter bomb revealed rift

HYDERABAD: In an escalation of intra-party squabbling in Telangana, Bharat Rashtra Samithi MLC and former MP Kalvakuntla Kavitha, daughter of party supremo K Chandrasekhar Rao, Thursday accused senior netas within her own party of attempting to merge BRS with BJP - a move she says she vehemently opposed even while incarcerated in the Delhi liquor policy scam case last year.Interacting with media at her residence, Kavitha tore into the party leadership, indirectly targeting working president and her brother KT Rama Rao for failing to act against 'internal coverts,' not responding to attacks from Congress, and remaining silent during a coordinated smear campaign against her.""When I was in jail, there was talk of merging BRS with BJP. I told my father, let party remain independent, even if it meant I stayed in jail for another year,"" Kavitha said. She added her actions were aimed only at strengthening the party, and backstabbing was not in her DNA.Kavitha said there was an internal conspiracy to sideline her and sever her connection with KCR. Referring to the leak of a private letter she had written to her father earlier this month, she accused party insiders of attempting to discredit her and questioned why the leadership failed to act against those responsible.""Instead of finding those who leaked the letter, they unleashed paid social media trolls and media artistes, even from abroad, to malign me,"" she quipped.The succession war within BRS - between KTR and Kavitha - has come at a time when BRS is celebrating its silver jubilee and at the same time grappling with multiple issues, including fighting a legal battle over defections by its MLAs who have joined Congress.Analysts say succession battles typically arise after the supremo is no longer in picture. However, in BRS's case, power tussle has begun while KCR is still at the helm. Sources said KCR's relatives within BRS have already split into camps, supporting either KTR or Kavitha.The rift between the duo became apparent after Kavitha wrote a 'feedback letter' to KCR regarding his speech at the BRS silver jubilee meeting in Warangal. In the letter, she expressed dissatisfaction, particularly regarding KCR in his speech not targeting the BJP, not addressing the issue of BC reservations, lack of accessibility to BRS leaders, and other concerns.

Arguing her case, she questions the differentiation between electric and thermal burn marks without chemical analysis.

Poll Should courts consider new scientific arguments even after a verdict is given? Yes, to ensure justice is served No, verdicts should be final

HC tells chem prof it's hearing her arguments with an 'open mind'





BHOPAL/JABALPUR: A 60-year-old professor, sentenced to 20 years in jail for killing her husband, has challenged the autopsy report saying that as a chemistry professor, she knows what impact electrocution has on the body.The court heard her arguments recently and reserved judgment, pending which her sentence has been suspended.The convict, Mamta Pathak of Chhatarpur, is arguing her case before an HC division bench of Justices Vivek Agarwal and Devnarayan Mishra. Videos of her argument are being shared widely on social media.She is seen trying to drive home her contention that it's not possible to differentiate between 'electric and thermal burn marks' in an autopsy, and this can be done only through chemical analysis.Justice Agarwal asks her if she is a professor of chemistry; she nods and says, ""Yes."" The judge then asks her why her counsel did not ask the question of the doctor who had conducted the post-mortem examination during cross-examination in the trial court. She says, ""I was in jail then."" Justice Agarwal points out her error when she mixes up nitric acid and hydrochloric acid.According to the prosecution, Mamta's husband, Dr Neeraj Pathak (63), was found dead in his house in Chhatarpur on April 29, 2021. Electric burn marks were detected at five places on his body.Mamta, who teaches chemistry in a Chhatarpur college, lived separately from her husband but had returned to him a few months before his death. Although the couple had started living together again, they often fought over her suspicion that Neeraj had had an affair, the prosecution said. On the day of the incident, Neeraj called up a relative and told him that Mamta had been ""torturing"" him for two-three days; that she had not given him food and kept him locked in the bathroom. According to the prosecution, Neeraj said he suffered head injuries when she ""thrust him into the bathroom"". The relative contacted police, and Mamta released him from the bathroom when the cops intervened, says the prosecution. The relative, who is a witness in the case, called Neeraj later in the day to check on him. A recording of their phone conversation was presented in the trial court.The same night, Neeraj died around 9pm. According to Mamta, she went to ask him for food but found that his pulse had stopped and he was dead. The next day, she went to Jhansi for dialysis but it couldn't be done in the absence of a Covid certificate. She returned at 9pm and only then informed police that her husband was dead, police said. Investigators found sleeping pills in her husband's room. The trial court held her guilty on the basis of circumstantial evidence and sentenced her to 20 years' rigorous imprisonment.In her argument, Mamta said her husband had got his house insured and it was safe from any kind of accident due to a short circuit or leak. She claimed that no expert inspected the house following the death of her husband.The prof also questioned why there was no mention of foul smell emanating from her husband's body in the autopsy report or anywhere else as the postmortem examination was conducted 36 hours after his death and the body starts decomposing after 18 hours. The bench told Mamta that they are hearing her ""out of turn"" and with an ""open mind"" but cases are decided on the ""touchstone of evidence"". The verdict has been reserved.","Mamta Pathak, 60, was sentenced to 20 years in jail for killing her husband, Dr Neeraj Pathak.

(AI image)

Trump Administration Message: ‘We will do it another way’

What does it mean for other countries?

The Donald Trump administration is evaluating a two-part strategy to deal with the US trade court ruling that blocked the American President’s sweeping reciprocal tariffs on several countries. The court ruling said that Trump overstepped his authority in imposing the tariffs.Currently, the Court of International Trade's judgement against Trump's tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act remains suspended due to an emergency stay. For now, this will help Donald Trump retain his negotiating power with trading partners.However, if subsequent court rulings also uphold the strike down of tariffs, US government officials have indicated that they have other measures up their sleeve.In the first part of the twofold response, officials are exploring the implementation of broad-based tariffs across international markets using an unprecedented section of the Trade Act of 1974, according to a Wall Street Journal report.This provision permits levies up to 15% for 150 days to address trade deficits with international partners, according to the sources quoted in the report.Also Read | ‘Overstepped his authority…’: What are the scathing observations made by US trade court in ruling against Donald Trump’s tariffs? Under Section 122, Trump has the authority to implement a 15% tariff for a duration of 150 days to control imports. This provision aims to tackle balance-of-payments issues or prevent substantial devaluation of the dollar. However, any extension beyond the initial 150-day period would necessitate Congressional approval.This interim measure would provide Trump sufficient time to develop country-specific tariffs for major trading nations under a separate clause of the identical legislation, which addresses unfair international trade conduct.The second approach involves a detailed notification and consultation process, which administration officials believe provides stronger legal standing compared to the recently invalidated tariff policy.This alternative method has precedent, having been employed multiple times previously, including during Trump's initial China tariffs.In a Bloomberg TV interview, Peter Navarro, senior counselor for trade and manufacturing, acknowledged the administration's consideration of a dual-pronged tariff strategy. This would initially implement Section 122 of the 1974 trade law, followed by Section 301.When questioned about these specific provisions, Navarro confirmed, ""Those are the kinds of thoughts"" being evaluated by the economic team.He spoke of the potential application of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which enables tariffs against nations engaging in discriminatory practices against the US. He also mentioned the possibility of expanding tariffs based on national security considerations.""So you can assume that even if we lose, we will do it another way,"" Navarro said.Navarro expressed confidence in their robust IEEPA position. ""I think the big picture here is we've got a very strong case with IEEPA, but the court basically tells us, if we lose that, we just do some other things. So nothing's really changed,"" Navarro said.Also Read | Donald Trump’s trade policy thrown into turmoil! Will countries like India, China be tempted to hold off tariff talks? Globally, the implications are significant. Legal experts and trade analysts suggest that while court decisions might temporarily hinder Trump's worldwide tariff strategy, they are unlikely to completely halt his efforts to secure trade advantages through pressure tactics. These rulings could simply lead to a shift in legal frameworks rather than a complete cessation.Specialists are advising their international stakeholders, businesses and other interested parties to anticipate that Trump will persist with his tariff agenda, albeit potentially through different mechanisms.""This is just the opening salvo,"" said Dan Ujczo, a lawyer and U.S.-Canada trade expert at Thompson Hine in Columbus, Ohio. ""The Trump administration has a number of options including reframing the executive orders to include some of the boundaries used in the CIT opinion,” Ujczo was quoted as saying by Reuters.""For folks celebrating this opinion, this may be a case of be careful what you ask for,"" he added.Also Read | ‘Blatantly wrong’: Donald Trump administration blasts US court ruling blocking tariffs; says trade policy will continue","The US trade court ruling that blocked the American President’s sweeping reciprocal tariffs on several countries.

'Talks Only On Return Of PoK': India Rejects Pak PM Shehbaz Sharif's Call For Dialogue | Kashmir





Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday repeated his call to hold talks with India, urging both nations to sit down ""for peace"" and resolve long-standing issues, including Kashmir, water sharing, and terrorism. The change of tone in Pakistan's language can be noticed after India's punitive diplomatic steps and strong military counterterror action under Operation Sindoor against Pakistan, in retaliation of Pahalgam terror attack.His remarks came during the Pakistan-Turkiye-Azerbaijan Trilateral Summit in Lachin, Azerbaijan, where he was joined by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev.This was Sharif’s second call for dialogue in a week. On Monday, while in Tehran, he expressed a similar willingness to engage with India “to resolve all disputes.”“We must sit together and talk for the sake of peace… There are issues that demand immediate attention and must be addressed through dialogue,” Sharif said, according to Dawn.He added, “I have said in all humility that we want peace in the region[…] and that requires talks on the table on issues which need urgent attention and amicable resolution, that is the issue of Kashmir according to the resolutions of the United Nations and the Security Council and as per the aspirations of the people of Kashmir.”Sharif also expressed openness to discussing counterterrorism with India, saying, “I have said in all earnest that if India wants to talk on countering terrorism in sincerity of purpose, Pakistan would be willing to talk to India on this issue as well.” He further stated his desire to resume trade ties, and criticised India’s decision to suspend the Indus Water Treaty , calling it a vital resource for Pakistan's drinking and agricultural needs.However, India has made its stance unequivocally clear: talks with Pakistan will only focus on two issues, Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) and terrorism.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his first statement following Operation Sindoor, said: “Today, I would also like to tell the global community that our stated policy has been: if there are talks with Pakistan, it will be only on terrorism; and if there are talks with Pakistan, it will be only on Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).”Tensions between the two countries have intensified since the April 22 terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam, which left 26 dead.In retaliation, India launched Operation Sindoor, a coordinated military campaign that began on May 7, targeting nine terror launchpads in Pakistan and PoK.The Indian Air Force also destroyed 11 Pakistani airbases in response to Pakistan's failed attempts to strike Indian military positions on May 8, 9, and 10.The conflict de-escalated after both sides agreed to halt military actions following a meeting between their directors general of military operations on May 10.","Pakistan's PM Shehbaz Sharif calls for talks with India to resolve long-standing issues, including Kashmir, water sharing, and terrorism.

Tommy Robinson gets early release because of ‘change in attitude’

British far-right activist Tommy Robinson walked free on parole earlier today after a UK judge granted his early release from an 18-month sentence for contempt of court . Upon release, Robinson credited tech billionaire Elon Musk and the platform for enabling him to share his version of events. “I have to say a thank you to Elon Musk, because without X, if we didn't have X, everyone would just think I lied. No one would have got any other narrative,"" he said during a livestream to his followers. ""These attempts at censorship, to silence, to cancel people, it hasn't worked. You've attempted to lock up the truth. And that truth has been echoed around the entire globe,"" he added.Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon was jailed for violating a court order prohibiting him from repeating libelous claims about a Syrian refugee, Jamal Hijazi . He was sent to jail in October 2024 for contempt of court after admitting that he broke a legal order. The 42-year-old had accused Hijazi of being a violent bully—allegations a court deemed false.He later featured the claims in a documentary titled Silenced, which he shared on X (formerly Twitter), owned by Elon Musk. Musk has previously expressed support for Robinson, saying he was jailed “for telling the truth” and calling for his release.Justice Jeremy Johnson granted Robinson’s early release, citing a “change in attitude” though with ""absence of contrition or remorse.""""He has given an assurance that he will comply with the injunction in the future, that he has no intention of breaching it again, and that he is aware of the consequences of what would happen if he breached the injunction again,"" the judge said.Robinson admitted in October to breaching the injunction by promoting the Silenced film and discussing the case in media interviews and public rallies. His previous videos about Hijazi reportedly led to widespread harassment of the boy, who dropped out of school and relocated with his family.

Their scooter was found abandoned near Osara Hills. Search teams are combing the area near Shillong.

Missing couple’s rented vehicle, bag found in ‘crime-prone’ hills





INDORE: What was meant to be a joyful beginning of a new chapter in life has turned into a nightmare for the families of Raja and Sonam Raghuwanshi — a young couple from Indore who disappeared during their honeymoon in Meghalaya.For the past six days, their loved ones have been clinging to hope, while search teams comb the rain-drenched forests and dangerous cliffs near Shillong, praying for a sign of life. In desperation, the family has announced a reward of Rs 5 lakh for any information about their whereabouts.Madhya Pradesh chief minister Mohan Yadav spoke with Meghalaya CM Conrad Sangma on Tuesday, requesting swift action to locate the couple.Raja, a 30-year-old transport businessman, and Sonam, whom he had married just weeks earlier, left Indore for Guwahati on May 20.They were excited to explore the lush hills of the Northeast — a dream trip for both. After two days in Guwahati, they headed to Shillong. The last time the family heard from them was on May 23.“We were in touch with them until that day. After that, their phones were switched off. We knew something was wrong,” said Govind Raghuwanshi, Sonam’s brother.“They were newly married, just beginning a future together. We never imagined this.”The worry turned to dread when their rented scooter was found abandoned near Osara Hills in Sohra Rim — a remote area notorious for being unsafe and prone to criminal activity. Two bags belonging to the couple were later discovered in a nearby gorge, partially hidden in the bushes on Tuesday.Despite the rain and treacherous terrain, more than 50 people — including police officers, local villagers, and members of the village defence party — have been tirelessly searching for the couple.Their family has refused to give up. “We will not stop until we find them,” said Govind, who flew to Shillong along with Raja’s brother Vipin a day later.Indore MP Shankar Lalwani travelled to Shillong on Wednesday and met the state’s DGP Idashisha Nongrang. “All evidence so far points to foul play,” he said. “This wasn’t an accident. The couple had four phones, including two iPhones — all are switched off. They were also wearing jewellery.”Piecing together the last known movements of the couple has been haunting. They reportedly visited the famous Double Decker Living Root Bridge in Nongriat village, a challenging trek that takes hours. It’s believed they spent the night nearby and were seen the next morning having tea at a small roadside kiosk. After that they went missing.“It takes at least four to five hours to descend towards Nongrait village and people usually stay there for the night before returning. We found out that they had returned and had also had tea at a kiosk on the way after which they went missing,” said Govind, fearing that they were attacked by robbers.The distances between where their scooter was found, their bags, and their last known tea stop have only deepened the mystery. “There’s a big gap in the timeline. Something happened between those points. Maybe they were followed. Maybe they were robbed,” Govind said.The search is now concentrated around a gorge near the Root Bridge, about 50km from Shillong.","Raja and Sonam Raghuwanshi, a newly married couple from Indore, went missing during their honeymoon in Meghalaya.

PANCHKULA: Three days after the mass suicide, the district police are yet to obtain handwriting samples of Praveen Mittal to verify the authenticity of the suicide note found at the scene, a key step in ruling out any foul play.To match the handwriting and signature in the note, investigators have reached out to Mittal's bank, requesting documents that contain his handwritten content, such as forms, cheques, or correspondence.However, the bank has not yet shared any such material with the police, slowing down the forensic process, said a police official.""We are doing everything we can to obtain the samples. Once we have them, they will be sent to forensic experts immediately,"" said a police official.Police said that two suicide notes were recovered-one appeared to have been abandoned midway, with visible cuts and corrections, suggesting that Praveen Mittal was dissatisfied with it and started over. The second note was more complete and coherent. Both were signed. The notes, allegedly written by Mittal, cite bankruptcy as the reason for the drastic step and do not blame anyone.He also mentioned in the note that he was concerned that his minor kids would be left on the roads after they passed away, so they were also made part of the ""suicide"" pact. They were supposedly given the poisonous substance in a soft drink, while others seemed to have consumed it with water.","Police are yet to obtain handwriting samples of Praveen Mittal to verify the authenticity of the suicide note.

The Lancet study links the outbreak to unsterile dental practices at a local clinic, where a contaminated saline solution, used during procedures, directly infected patients.



Outbreak linked to unsterile dental practices: Probe

Poll What do you think is the most effective way to prevent similar outbreaks in the future? Better hygiene practices Regular health inspections





CHENNAI: Eight people died of neuromelioidosis — a bacterial infection of the brain — that they got from a dental clinic in Vaniyambadi town of Tamil Nadu’s Tirupattur district in 2023, a study published in The Lancet has revealed.The outbreak, which hasn’t been reported by any govt agency, has been linked to unsterile dental practices, according to an investigation by a team of doctors from multiple organisations including CMC Vellore, ICMR-NIE and Tamil Nadu Directorate of Public Health.The study said an unsterile surgical instrument called a periosteal elevator was used to open a saline bottle, which was then loosely resealed. Reuse of its contents by the clinic led to at least 10 people contracting the infection and eight of them dying, pegging the fatality rate at 80%, said the first author of the study, Dr Angel Miraclin Thirugnanakumar of the neurological sciences department at CMC.“The rapid and high fatality may be because the bacteria in the saline travelled directly along nerve pathways when used to clean the patients’ mouth during procedures, rather than through the bloodstream, a common route for such infections,” the researcher concluded. Whole genome sequencing showed that the bacteria has a gene that aggressively attacks the brain.Neuromelioidosis is a severe infection of the central nervous system, that includes the brain and the spinal cord, caused by bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei which is found in contaminated soil and water in tropical and subtropical regions.Symptoms include fever and headache followed by slurred speech, visual distortion and in some cases facial palsy.Between July 2022 and April 2023, the researchers identified 21 cases of neuromelioidosis (including 10 patients who went to the dental clinic) and total nine deaths. The fatality rate among the remaining 11 patients who didn’t go to the dental clinic was 9%. Of the total 21 patients, 17 were in Tirupattur district, two in Ranipet, and one each in Tiruvannamalai and Krishnagiri. The patients who succumbed after their visit to the dental clinic had a quicker death since the infection date. It took 16 days from symptom onset to death and nine days from hospitalisation among patients who went to the clinic compared to 56 and 38 days respectively in case of the lone fatality not linked to the dental clinic.State public health officials said the study would help identify such cases to understand the epidemiology and initiate micro-containment measures. “We have stopped the spread with corrective measures. It’s also a reminder for healthcare providers to be aware of infection control measures,” said director of public health Dr T S Selvavinayagam.On May 9, 2023, CMC notified an increase in neuromelioidosis cases and said some of them were linked to the dental clinic. On May 13, 2023, health officials held a meeting with healthcare facilities and other stakeholders in Tirupattur and neighbouring districts. Soon, a team of doctors investigated the cluster to describe the clinical and epidemiological characteristics and identify the source of infection, said co-author Prabu Rajkumar from the ICMR-NIE.“But before doctors could visit the dental clinic to pick samples, the clinic was disinfected, the water supply was cut off, and the clinic was closed following public outcry,” the authors wrote. However, scientists identified B. pseudomallei from the saline bottle sample. There was no contamination in unopened saline bottles. More samples were tested, and whole genome sequencing was done for further verification.Analysis showed head and neck involvement, such as inflammation of a salivary gland (parotid gland), inner lining of cheeks (buccal mucosa), along with enlargement or swelling of one or more lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy), was common in cases not linked to the dental clinic. But those with dental exposure showed rapid progression, presenting with facial cellulitis and soft tissue abscess, probably because the contaminated saline was ingested.","Neuromelioidosis, a bacterial brain infection, claimed eight lives in Vaniyambadi, Tamil Nadu, in 2023.

Passports suggest West African link

Ongoing crisis in Mali raises concerns

Questions remain as investigation continues





Authorities in St Vincent and the Grenadines have launched a major investigation after a vessel carrying the decomposed remains of at least 11 people washed ashore on the small Eastern Caribbean island of Canouan earlier this week.The Royal St Vincent and the Grenadines Police Force (RSVGPF) said it received a report around 10.45 am on Monday regarding a suspicious vessel found near Little Bay and Cherry Hill. Officers from the local Canouan police station responded and discovered the remains aboard the 45-foot-long boat.According to the RSVGPF, the bodies were in an “advanced state of decomposition,” with some not fully intact. The exact cause of death remains unknown, and authorities have not yet confirmed the identities of the deceased.Investigators recovered several passports from the vessel, which appear to originate from the West African nation of Mali. However, police stressed that no official identifications have been made, and forensic work is ongoing.The human remains have since been transported to St Vincent and are being held at the Kingstown mortuary for further analysis.“This incident is deeply concerning, and we understand the public’s interest in the matter,” the RSVGPF said in a statement.“We assure you that the RSVGPF is treating this investigation with the utmost seriousness and sensitivity.”Authorities also noted that they are collaborating with regional and international partners in efforts to trace the boat's origin and determine how and why it ended up adrift in the Caribbean.While the exact circumstances surrounding the tragic journey remain unclear, the discovery comes amid worsening instability in Mali, a landlocked country in West Africa facing severe security and humanitarian crises.The US state department has issued a Level 4 “Do Not Travel” advisory for Mali since July 2023, citing ongoing threats of terrorism, kidnapping, and violent crime.“Terrorist and armed groups continue plotting kidnappings and attacks in Mali,” the advisory notes, warning of attacks on public and diplomatic spaces frequently visited by foreigners.It is not yet known how long the vessel had been at sea, what conditions the passengers faced, or what led to the tragic loss of life. Authorities have not ruled out the possibility that the boat was part of a migration attempt gone wrong, a concern echoed by officials and international observers amid a growing number of perilous sea journeys in recent years.The RSVGPF said it is committed to “pursuing every lead” and ensuring that “all appropriate protocols are followed” as it works to uncover the full story behind the grim discovery.","Authorities in St Vincent and the Grenadines have launched a major investigation after a vessel carrying the decomposed remains of at least 11 people washed ashore on the small Eastern Caribbean island of Canouan.

At a politically charged commencement ceremony on Thursday, MIT ’s class of 2025 president Megha Vemuri, an Indian-American student, used her platform to deliver a bold pro-Palestinian message, sharply criticising the university’s ties to Israel and calling on fellow graduates to take a stand.Wearing a red keffiyeh, a symbol of Palestinian solidarity, Vemuri addressed a crowd of graduates, families, and faculty, saying, “You showed the world that MIT wants a free Palestine.”Her remarks came amid ongoing nationwide campus unrest over the war in Gaza and US university connections to defence and research institutions tied to the conflict. In her speech, Vemuri acknowledged the uncertainty gripping academia and the intense pressures faced by student activists.“It is no secret that at this time, academic institutions across the country are shrouded in a dark cloud of uncertainty,” she said. “There is a lot of fear in many of our hearts.”Vemuri pointed to MIT’s research links with the Israeli military as a source of shame and moral conflict for the institution. “The Israeli occupation forces are the only foreign military that MIT has research ties with,” she said. “This means that Israel’s assault on the Palestinian people is not only aided and abetted by our country, but our school.”She noted that both MIT’s undergraduate body and its graduate student union had, in recent months, voted “overwhelmingly to cut ties with the genocidal Israeli military.”“You faced threats, intimidation and suppression coming from all directions, especially your own university officials, but you prevailed,” she told graduates. “Because the MIT community that I know would never tolerate a genocide.”Referring to the destruction of higher education infrastructure in Gaza, Vemuri added: “There are no universities left in Gaza. We are watching Israel try to wipe Palestine off the face of the earth, and it is a shame that MIT is a part of it.”The student leader concluded her address with a symbolic gesture, asking graduates to turn their MIT class rings so that the emblem faced outward—a tradition symbolising their move into the wider world. But her message was pointed.“We carry with us the obligation to do everything we can to stop it,” she said. “MIT is directly complicit in the ongoing genocide of the Palestinian people.”","Megha Vemuri, an Indian-American student, used her platform to deliver a bold pro-Palestinian message.

Disappointment in judicial picks

Tariffs and legal battle continue





US President Donald Trump wrote a fiery post on social media on Thursday night after a federal court ruling challenged the legality of his proposed tariffs, criticising the judiciary and taking aim at prominent conservative legal figures.The controversy stems from a recent decision by the US court of international trade, which on Wednesday ruled that Trump had exceeded his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) in attempting to implement new tariffs. However, a day later, the US court of appeals for the federal circuit issued a temporary stay, allowing the tariffs to remain in place for now.Reacting to the development on Truth Social, Trump blasted the court of international trade’s ruling as “incredible” and politically motivated. “Where do these initial three Judges come from?” Trump wrote. “Is it purely a hatred of ‘TRUMP?’ What other reason could it be?”In a striking departure from usual Republican rhetoric, Trump also lashed out at the Federalist Society, a conservative legal group influential in shaping his judicial nominations during his presidency. He specifically targeted Leonard Leo, co-chairman of the organisation’s board, accusing him of giving “bad advice” and harbouring personal ambitions.“It was suggested that I use The Federalist Society as a recommending source on Judges,” Trump posted. “I did so, openly and freely, but then realized that they were under the thumb of a real ‘sleazebag’ named Leonard Leo, a bad person who, in his own way, probably hates America.”Trump expressed frustration over some of the judges he appointed while in office, blaming the Federalist Society for pushing names that he now regrets. “I am very proud of many of our picks, but very disappointed in others,” he wrote. “They always must do what’s right for the Country!”Trump concluded his lengthy post by reiterating support for his proposed tariffs, which he insists are crucial for America’s economic security. “The ruling by the US Court of International Trade is so wrong, and so political!” he declared, expressing hope that the Supreme Court would overturn the decision “quickly and decisively.”“The President of the United States must be allowed to protect America against those that are doing it Economic and Financial harm,” he added.","US President Donald Trump wrote a fiery post on social media on Thursday night after a federal court ruling challenged the legality of his proposed tariffs.

SINGAPORE: French President Emmanuel Macron and US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth are among the world leaders, diplomats and top defence officials in Singapore this weekend for a security forum that will focus on China's growing assertiveness, the global impact of Russia's war on Ukraine and the flare-up of conflicts in Asia.Macron opens the conference with a keynote address Friday night that is expected to touch on all of those issues, as well as the pressure the hefty tariffs announced by President Donald Trump's administration is putting on Asian allies.It's Hegseth's first time to the Shangri-La dialogue, hosted by the International Institute for Security Studies, which is taking place against the backdrop of heightened rhetoric between Beijing and Washington due to the Trump administration's threat of triple digit tariffs on China, and some uncertainty in the region over how committed the US is to the defence of Taiwan, which also faces possible 32 per cent American tariffs.China claims the self-governing democracy as its own, and Chinese President Xi Jinping has not ruled out taking it by force. China sends military aircraft, ships and spy balloons near Taiwan as part of a campaign of daily harassment, and currently has an aircraft carrier in the waters southeast of the island.Hegseth told reporters before he boarded his plane for Singapore that Washington's policies were meant to deter a Chinese invasion of Taiwan.""We seek no conflict with anybody, including the Communist Chinese,"" he said. ""We will stay strong for our interests. And that's a big part of what this trip is all about.""China, which usually sends its defense minister to the Shangri-La forum, appears to be sending a lower-level delegation this year but has not said why.Hegseth's trip to Singapore is his second to the region since becoming defence secretary, following a March visit to the Philippines, which has seen escalating confrontations with China over competing territorial claims in the South China Sea That trip, which also included a stop in Japan, brought a degree of relief over growing concerns from the Philippines and others in the region about US support from a president who has taken more of a transactional approach to diplomacy and seems wary of foreign engagements.The US has been pursuing a ""free and open Indo-Pacific"" policy, which includes regularly sailing warships through the Taiwan Strait and in the South China Sea, which is claimed almost in its entirety by China.The European Union has adopted a more economics-driven approach, but several European nations have also regularly taken part in the freedom of navigation exercises, including France which sent a carrier strike group on a five-month mission through the Indo-Pacific that concluded in April.In its published Indo-Pacific strategy, France has underscored the need to ""preserve a rules-based international order"" in the face of ""China's increasing power and territorial claims"" and its global competition with the United States.France's own ties to the Indo-Pacific are strong, with more than 1.6 million of its citizens living in the region in French overseas territories.In his speech, Macron is expected also to stress that the war in Ukraine is having a worldwide impact and that Russia seeks to destabilize Asia, the French president's office said.While democracies from the region, including Australia, South Korea and Japan, have been aiding Ukraine, China has been growingly supportive of Russia and North Korea has sent troops to fight for Moscow.The conference comes as civil war continues to rage in Myanmar, creating a massive humanitarian crisis that has only been compounded by the effects of a devastating earthquake that hit in March.It also follows the outbreak of violence this week on the Thai-Cambodian border, in which a Cambodian soldier was killed in a brief exchange of fire between the two sides. Thailand and Cambodia have a long history of land disputes, though Thailand said after the short skirmish that the situation had been resolved.Of greater concern, nuclear-armed neighbours India and Pakistan came to the brink of war earlier this month in their most serious military confrontation in decades.

A Chinese paraglider had a miraculous escape after being swept nearly 29,000 feet into the sky by a powerful updraft over the Qilian Mountains in Gansu Province.Peng Yujiang, an experienced B-level paraglider, was testing a second-hand harness on Saturday when the wind suddenly picked up and lifted him high into the upper atmosphere — without any oxygen equipment.“I had just bought a second-hand paragliding harness and wanted to test it, so I was conducting ground parachute shaking,” Peng told China Central Television (CCTV). “After a while, the wind suddenly picked up and lifted me into the air. I tried to land as soon as possible, but I failed.”Amateur video aired by Chinese state media showed Peng drifting through thick clouds, his face and clothing caked in ice as he battled the freezing conditions at an altitude of 8,598 metres (28,208 feet).He described being trapped inside dense cumulonimbus clouds and completely disoriented. “It was terrifying — everything around me was white. Without the compass, I wouldn’t have known which direction I was heading. I thought I was flying straight, but in reality, I was spinning,” he said.Despite nearly losing consciousness and losing feeling in his hands due to the cold, Peng managed to navigate his way out using his compass and stayed in contact with teammates via radio.“As soon as I came out of the clouds, I was very excited because I had survived,” he recalled. “The scariest moment was when I tried to pull out of the spiral and failed and when the canopy nosedived. It’s still frightening to think about.”Peng, who has been paragliding for over four years, said the experience has left him shaken. “I’m not sure about the future, but for now I definitely won’t fly for a while,” he added.","Peng Yujiang, an experienced B-level paraglider, was testing a second-hand harness on Saturday when the wind suddenly picked up and lifted him high into the upper atmosphere.

A Russian deputy mayor and prominent veteran of Moscow’s war in Ukraine was killed in a suspected bombing in southern Russia, officials confirmed on Thursday.The 34 year old Zaur Aleksandrovich Gurtsiev died in an early morning explosion on a street in Stavropol, along with another man. The blast was caused by a “homemade explosive device,” as per investigators cited by CNN.Russia’s Investigative Committee said “As part of the investigation, the scene of the incident is being inspected, examinations are being ordered, and the necessary investigative actions are being carried out to establish all the circumstances of the incident.”Stavropol region governor Vladimir Vladimirov said on Telegram that “all versions are being considered, including the organisation of a terrorist attack” possibly linked to Ukraine.Gurtsiev had risen to prominence through the Kremlin-backed “Time of Heroes” programme, launched by President Vladimir Putin to promote war veterans into public office. According to the programme’s website, Gurtsiev led aerial operations during Russia’s controversial siege of Mariupol in 2022.“He introduced his developments in the technology of targeting missiles, which allowed them to increase their accuracy and effectiveness many times over, including hitting the Azov supply base,” the site states.The capture of Mariupol followed an 86-day siege that left much of the city in ruins. UN estimates suggest 90% of residential buildings were either damaged or destroyed, with around 350,000 people forced to flee. Ukrainian officials claim up to 20,000 civilians were killed, though that figure remains unverified.Gurtsiev’s death comes amid a string of attacks on Russian military figures inside the country. Last month, authorities arrested an alleged Ukrainian agent in connection with a car bomb that killed General Yaroslav Moskalik, a top officer in Russia’s military command.In February, Armen Sarkisyan, a pro-Russian militia leader in eastern Ukraine, died in a bombing in central Moscow.","Zaur Aleksandrovich Gurtsiev died in an early morning explosion on a street in Stavropol, along with another man.

"Israel agrees to US proposal for temporary ceasefire, Hamas considering: White House",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/israel-agrees-to-us-proposal-for-temporary-ceasefire-hamas-considering-white-house/articleshow/121498134.cms,"What does the new proposal offer?

What does Israel want?

What does Hamas want?





Israel has agreed to a new US-backed proposal for a temporary ceasefire with Hamas, the White House confirmed on Thursday, in what could mark a major step toward halting the devastating war in Gaza and securing the release of more hostages.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that Israel has “backed and supported” the plan, which came after recent efforts by US President Donald Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff.Witkoff had earlier expressed cautious optimism about mediating a breakthrough deal, which would pause hostilities and pave the way for the return of hostages captured.In a statement, Hamas said it had received the proposal and was “reviewing it responsibly to serve the interests of our people, provide them relief, and achieve a permanent ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.”Previously, Hamas had said it reached a “general framework” agreement with the US envoy, outlining steps toward a lasting ceasefire. The framework included a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, increased humanitarian aid, and a handover of governance from Hamas to a politically independent Palestinian committee.More than 54,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed since Israel resumed its military offensive in March, according to Gaza health officials.The October 7 attack by Hamas, which triggered the conflict, left 1,200 Israelis dead and 251 taken hostage.Although the full details of the proposal have not been made public, sources close to the negotiations say that the ceasefire would see Israeli troops pull back to earlier positions and allow for the release of 10 living hostages and several bodies in exchange for over 1,100 Palestinian prisoners, including those 100 serving long sentences on conviction of the deadly attacks.It also calls for a 60-day halt in fighting. Notably, the plan includes the assurance that Israel will not resume military operations once the hostages are freed.Hundreds of aid trucks would also be allowed into Gaza each day during the truce, a vital lifeline for a population suffering under a months-long blockade that has brought many to the brink of famine.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long maintained that the war will not end until all hostages are freed and Hamas is either dismantled or forced into exile. He also declared that Israel will retain long-term control over Gaza and promote what he describes as the voluntary emigration of a large portion of its population.However, plans to resettle Gaza’s population have been firmly rejected by Palestinians and much of the international community, with experts warning that such a move would likely breach international law.Hamas has made clear it will release the remaining hostages, its sole leverage, only in exchange for the release of more Palestinian prisoners, a permanent ceasefire, and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. The group has also signalled its willingness to relinquish control to a politically independent Palestinian committee that would lead reconstruction efforts.Hamas is still holding 58 hostages, of which only a third are believed to be living. However, As the war lingers on, their lives continue to be in danger.","Israel has agreed to a new US-backed proposal for a temporary ceasefire with Hamas, the White House confirmed on Thursday.
