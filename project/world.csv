Robert Vadra's remark on Pahalgam attack

NEW DELHI: Businessman Robert Vadra , husband of Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra , on Monday issued a clarification regarding his recent remark on the Pahalgam terrorist attack . In a Facebook post, he said people had ""misinterpreted"" his intentions.Vadra had earlier said the Pahalgam terrorists killed people after checking their IDs, ""because they think that Muslims are being suppressed.""Vadra wrote in his clarification post, ""My intentions have been misinterpreted. I am committed to clarifying myself with honesty, transparency, and respect. I decided to wait in silence for a few days, but this should not be construed as silence, indifference or lack of patriotism. In fact, it is because of my deep love for my country, my deep respect for truth and my commitment to dedication that I took the time to reflect before speaking. Silence is the stage where responsibility matures, emotions calm down and words can be chosen carefully rather than impulsively.""He added, ""I strongly condemn the terrorist attack in Pahalgam that took the lives of innocent people and shattered their families. I stand with India and will always do so. There is no argument - political, religious or ideological - that can be used to stop this attack. Violence against innocent and unarmed people cannot be condoned.""Also, the industrialist called terrorism an ""attack on the soul of humanity"" and stated that ""no reason or logic"" can justify killing of innocent people.Vadra's post further read, ""I mourn for all those whose lives were lost, whose future was taken away, whose hearts were filled with unimaginable grief, and I urge everyone to remember the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi - he said that non-violence is the courageous choice. The suffering of our countrymen is our own suffering. Today, in this hour of grief, I express my commitment to build a world where no child, no family, no community lives under the shadow of terror.""On April 23, a day after the attack, Vadra said, ""When this terrorist act took place, they (terrorists) were looking at IDs...non-Muslims were attacked and messages were given to the prime minister. Why is this happening? Because they (terrorists) feel Muslims are being mistreated in our country.""Hitting back at Vadra, BJP spokesperson Nalin Kohli accused Vadra of using the ""same language that terrorists always use to justify their terrorism.""Kohli said, ""It's clear from Vadra's remarks that he wants to do politics on such a gruesome terror attack when the entire country is united against it.""","Robert Vadra had earlier said the Pahalgam terrorists killed people after checking their IDs, ""because they think that Muslims are being suppressed"" Vadra wrote in his clarification post, ""My intentions have been misinterpreted.

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Udit Raj on Sunday strongly criticised his party colleague Shashi Tharoor for his remarks over the Pahalgam terror attack , questioning Tharoor's loyalty to the party.Speaking to ANI, Raj asked, ""Is Shashi Tharoor in the Congress party or the BJP? Is he trying to become a super-BJP man?"" He further challenged Tharoor to question the BJP government about their plans regarding PoK (Pakistan-occupied Kashmir) and questioned whether he had become ""the BJP's advocate.""“I want to ask him which terrorist attack occurred in America after 9/11? Has the BJP made him its spokesperson?"" Raj asked.Shashi Tharoor on Sunday had said that the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack may have resulted from an intelligence failure, comparing it to the October 7, 2023, Hamas strike that caught Israel — known for its robust intelligence network — by surprise.Speaking to ANI, Tharoor had said, ""Obviously, there was no full proof intelligence. There was some failure... But we have got the example of Israel, the world's best intelligence services according to everybody, which were taken by surprise on October 7, just two years ago. It seems to me, just as Israel is waiting till the end of the war before they demand accountability, similarly, I think we too should see the present crisis through and then demand accountability from the government. No country can ever have a foolproof 100 per cent intelligence.""Tharoor also added that while successful prevention of terror attacks often goes unnoticed, failures tend to attract greater attention.""We will never know about the various terror attacks that were successfully thwarted. We only learn about the ones that we failed to thwart. This is normal in any nation. There were failures, I agree, but that should not be our main focus right now...,"" the Congress leader said.The April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, targeted tourists, leaving 26 people dead.

The assailants escaped after the shooting.Hours later, a video circulated online showing Manoj Chaudhary, with pistols tucked in his jeans, alleging he was from Kshatriya Gau Raksha Dal and taking responsibility for the murder. He claimed that he will avenge the killing of 26 - in an apparent reference to the Pahalgam incident - with 2600.Police had earlier dismissed the link of the murder to any operational Kshatriya Gau Raksha Dal unit in Agra, adding that the video was ""likely a publicity stunt"".

NEW DELHI: India's efforts to sensitise the international community about Pakistan's role in the Pahalgam attack continued Sunday with external affairs minister S Jaishankar taking up the cross-border terrorist attack with his UK counterpart David Lammy. On X, Jaishankar said that he underlined the importance of zero-tolerance for terrorism in the talks.As he leads India's diplomatic response to the attack, Jaishankar has stayed put in India skipping participation in the Brics foreign ministers' meeting in Brazil.As tensions soar with Pakistan, uncertainty looms over the proposed foreign visits in the next few weeks of other key players like NSA Ajit Doval and defence minister Rajnath Singh.Doval is also unlikely to travel to Brazil later this week for a Brics security meeting. While Singh is supposed to represent India at the Russian Victory Day parade in Moscow on May 9, the proposed visit hinges on how the situation evolves with Pakistan in the next few days.Govt has so far received messages of condemnation of the attack and solidarity from close to 140 countries, with 16 world leaders expressing those sentiments in phone calls to PM Narendra Modi . countries have all, including China, condemned the attack.Jaishankar's conversation with Lammy followed the latter's strong condemnation of the attack.

No, it may escalate tensions Yes, it's necessary for national security

NEW DELHI: India is keeping Pakistan on the edge by undertaking major muscle-flexing along the land and maritime boundaries, with the Army strongly responding to ceasefire violations along the Line of Control, the Navy conducting multiple missile firings by warships in the Arabian Sea and the IAF flying long-range day and night fighter sorties.As Indian and Pakistani troops exchanged small arms fire along the 778-km LoC for the third consecutive night, the Navy on Sunday declared it had conducted multiple firings of anti-ship missiles to ""revalidate and demonstrate the readiness of its platforms, systems and crew for long-range precision offensive strikes"".The ratcheting up of pressure seems part of the strategy to keep Pakistan unsettled till decisive strikes can take place in a cold, calculated manner if the govt so decides after factoring in the requisite escalation matrix without crossing nuclear redlines.In the Arabian Sea, at least four frontline destroyers and frigates have test-fired BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles, whose strike range has been extended to 450 km from the original 290 km, and other weapons over the last few days.With the Navy affirming that it stands ""combat ready, credible and future-ready"" to safeguard the nation's interests ""anytime, anywhere, anyhow"" and releasing videos and photos of the firing drills, the strategic messaging was quite clear.The air-breathing BrahMos, which flies almost three times the speed of sound at Mach 2.8, is the prime conventional (non-nuclear) precision-strike weapon for the armed forces.While the Army has at least four BrahMos regiments, the IAF has both land-based batteries as well as 40 Sukhoi-30MKI fighter jets armed with the sleeker air-to-ground missile variants. They are likely to come into play, along with other stand-off weapons, when the Indian govt decides to exercise the military option of limited punitive strikes against Pakistan, which could range from concentrated fire assaults without crossing the LoC to deeper precision strikes by fighter jets, as reported by TOI earlier.""Both PM Narendra Modi and defence minister Rajnath Singh have made it quite clear that there will deadly retribution for not only the perpetrators of the Pahalgam massacre, but also their masters pulling the strings from behind the scenes,"" a senior officer said.Along the LoC, the Army said several Pakistan Army posts had again ""initiated unprovoked firing"" with small arms like rifles and light machine guns at Indian positions in several areas, like Tutmari Gali, Rampur, Uri, Gurez and Sunderbani sectors, late on Saturday night.""Our troops responded in double measure effectively with appropriate small arms fire.

Poll Do you think the child's initial silence about the abuse is common in such cases? No, it should be reported immediately Yes, it's a common reaction

CHENNAI: A child's trauma at being sexually abused by her father, a mother's initial attempt to protect her without reporting the crime, a phone call from an aunt in Singapore that led to the ghastly secret inadvertently tumbling out, and a long, bumpy road to justice.Seven years of silence, fear, doubt, blackmail and legal complexities culminated recently in a Pocso trial court verdict that sent the convicted offender - a Chennai builder - to 20 years in jail. The abuse had started in April 2018, with the father targeting his then five-year-old daughter on the pretext of bathing her. When the child complained to her mother about what she was being subjected to, it led to regular fights between husband and wife.The child, already traumatised, further withdrew into her shell when she saw her parents quarrel. The abuse continued, but she would no longer complain lest the domestic situation worsen. The mother purportedly saw in her daughter's eyes what she couldn't express, so she sent the child to a relative's house in Thiruvarur district, 300km from Chennai.The crime might have been buried forever had the survivor's maternal aunt not called the relative's house one day and asked to speak to her niece.During the conversation, the child confided in her aunt that she was ""finally happy"" as she no longer faced ""torture"". Some prodding led to the survivor narrating her ordeal and naming her father as the culprit.The aunt flew down to Tamil Nadu within days and took her niece to a hospital, where medical tests confirmed injuries indicating sexual abuse .Based on the medical findings, a Pocso case was filed, and the father was arrested. In 2023, the girl's mother moved Madras high court and secured custody of her daughter. This coincided with the trial court denying bail to the father, citing his daughter's testimony.Over the next year, the mother allegedly tutored the child to retract her statements about being abused by her father. Although the court allowed the girl weekly visits to her aunt, her mother retained custody.At a hearing last week, the survivor told the court that no abuse of the kind she had previously detailed ever happened and that she wished for her family to live together. Despite the child denying she was abused, Pocso court judge M Rajalakshmi relied on her original statement - backed by her medical report - to deliver the verdict the girl's determined aunt and the prosecution were waiting to hear. The convict was also fined Rs 1 lakh.","Child was sexually abused by her father for seven years. Her mother sent her to a relative's house in Thiruvarur district, 300km from Chennai.

No, I think it's something more serious. Yes, it seems likely.

A massive explosion and fire at Shahid Rajaei port in southern Iran on Saturday killed 40 people and injured more than 750 others, authorities said, in an incident reportedly linked to a shipment of missile fuel chemicals .Mehrdad Hasanzadeh, a provincial disaster management official, confirmed the updated casualty figures on state television, raising the initial toll from four dead and over 500 injured. The blast occurred near Bandar Abbas as Iranian and US officials held a third round of nuclear negotiations in Oman.While Iranian officials did not immediately attribute the explosion to an attack, foreign minister Abbas Araghchi, leading the nuclear talks, said on Wednesday that “our security services are on high alert given past instances of attempted sabotage and assassination operations designed to provoke a legitimate response.”Authorities offered no clear cause for the blast but denied any link to the country's oil industry. However, private security firm Ambrey reported that the port had received a shipment of "" sodium perchlorate rocket fuel "" from China in March, intended to replenish Iran’s missile stockpiles after its direct attacks on Israel during the Gaza conflict.""The fire was reportedly the result of improper handling of a shipment of solid fuel intended for use in Iranian ballistic missiles,"" Ambrey said. Ship-tracking data analysed by the Associated Press supported Ambrey’s account, showing one of the vessels carrying the fuel in the area in March. Iran has not publicly acknowledged receiving the shipment, and its mission to the United Nations did not respond to requests for comment.Footage circulating on social media showed reddish smoke rising before the explosion, suggesting chemical involvement . In one video, a man shouted: “Get back get back! Tell the gas (truck) to go! Tell him to go, it’s going to blow up! Oh God, this is blowing up! Everybody evacuate! Get back! Get back!”Later, Iran's state-run IRNA news agency cited the Customs Administration blaming a “stockpile of hazardous goods and chemical materials stored in the port area” for the explosion, without further elaboration.Shahid Rajaei port, a major hub for Iranian cargo, has been targeted before, including a 2020 cyberattack attributed to Israel. Saturday’s explosion blew out windows miles away, caused building collapses, and left hospitals crowded with the injured, according to state media reports.The Interior Ministry said it had launched an investigation into the incident.

No, it undermines their credibility. Yes, it promotes dialogue.

Weeks after enjoying a surprisingly gracious dinner with Donald Trump , comedian Bill Maher unleashed a scathing critique of the President, accusing him of ""flirting with authoritarianism "" and warning that dictator jokes don't remain jokes for long.“Trump is the only president when you’re relieved when he doesn’t keep his campaign promises,” Maher joked, drawing a big laugh from the crowd.Maher specifically took issue with Trump's past remarks about staying in office beyond two terms, despite the constitutional ban under the 22nd Amendment , and his line about being a dictator ""only on Day One.""“That’s the problem with dictator jokes. They don’t stay jokes. And flirting with authoritarianism doesn’t stay flirting,” Maher warned.The comedian painted a vivid analogy to relationship cheating. “I’m telling you, humans cannot be trusted to just flirt with other attractive humans, and the MAGA crowd cannot be trusted to flirt with dictatorship,” he argued. “Not everyone who flirts cheats. But all cheating starts with flirting.”Maher, who was a vociferous Trump critic during his time in the White House, has been unexpectedly supported by some conservatives and libertarians of late for his public denunciations of ""wokeness."" But on Friday, he made it clear that his dinner meeting with Trump wouldn't silence him from decrying what he perceives as grave dangers.Earlier on Real Time with Bill Maher 's Friday show, the host began by confirming his end-of-March dinner with Trump, brokered after rock star Kid Rock urged the sit-down. Maher reported that the dinner was proof he could be objective, confessing, ""Everything I’ve not liked about him was, I swear to God, absent."" But Maher soon fell back into old habits, cautioning his viewers that Trump's public demeanor is another matter.""I've gotten some s–t from the loony left for just reporting, honestly, how the president responded in private when I was criticizing him to his face,"" Maher said. ""I was truthful about it. And that gives me standing to say to conservatives, 'Now okay, you enjoyed my honesty and balls, now I want to see your balls,'"" he joked. ""What I mean is — it's your turn.""Even after their temporary peace for dinner, Maher indicated there's no cease-fire in sight: he continues to view Trump as perilously close to full-blown authoritarianism, and he's not joking.","Bill Maher slammed Donald Trump on Friday's Real Time with Bill Maher.

The masked bandit who broke into a DC restaurant and made off with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem 's expensive Gucci purse, filled with thousands of dollars in cash, confidential government documents, and her DHS badge, has been caught, sources said Saturday, reported the New York Post.Noem, 53, was out celebrating Easter family dinner at The Capital Burger, a mile from the White House, when the slick heist took place on April 20. Her designer Gucci shoulder bag, slung carelessly at her feet, was stolen in a matter of seconds by a hooded thief with a surgical mask and a ball cap, a theft right out of a movie script.""It was kind of shocking, actually, because it was sitting right by my feet. I actually felt my purse — he hooked with his foot and drug it a few steps away and dropped a coat over it and took it,"" Noem said afterward in an interview with podcaster Vince Coglianese.At first, Noem said she thought it was just her grandkids kicking her under the table. ""But it was very professionally done,"" she said. ""It tells me that this happens all the time to people, and that they live in communities where this is a danger, and it reaffirms why I’m here.""Within the purloined fashion bag was a haul worthy of a thriller bestseller. $3,000 in cash, her driver's license, passport, DHS badge, and keys to her apartment. Also resting within the bag was a $600 Louis Vuitton Clemence wallet, the police report said, according to the Post.Security camera footage caught the thief in the act. A white male with dark-colored pants and a ""fur-type"" collar, scanning the crowded restaurant with his eyes. He nervously pushed the bag under his coat and rushed out the door, disappearing into the streets of DC before Noem or anyone else even knew what was happening.Sources indicate the suspect, whose name has not been released, is connected to a larger East Coast robbery gang that deals in high-end thefts. Authorities estimate at least two individuals were involved in Noem's robbery, one of whom is said to be a migrant. The second suspect is still at large.The suspect is set to make his initial court appearance early next week.Noem's protection squad, the Secret Service that looks after her under her cabinet rank as she guards Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection, as well as the Coast Guard, was involved during the arrest as well as that of the DC Metro Police. Noem's bodyguards were indeed present within the restaurant, even though their proximity to the burglary is in dispute.Investigations remain to be seen whether Noem was targeted due to her authoritative position, or the act was just an opportunistic crime. Noem herself is leaving it to law enforcement to find out.The arrest represents a significant milestone in what authorities believe is part of a larger trend of brazen, organized crimes on the East Coast, with high-profile targets such as Noem now in their sights.As the hunt for the second suspect continues, federal authorities are piecing together how deep the operations of this robbery crew might be.","Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's purse was stolen from a DC restaurant. The purse was filled with $3,000 in cash, her driver's license, passport, DHS badge, and keys to her apartment. The suspect, whose name has not been released, is connected to a larger East Coast robbery gang.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120659573,imgsize-202514,width-400,resizemode-4/Kristi-Noem.jpg"

"Massive immigration raid in Colorado: US police smash nightclub window to arrest over 100; videos go viral, Trump celebrates victory",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/massive-immigration-raid-in-colorado-us-police-smash-nightclub-window-to-arrest-over-100-videos-go-viral-trump-celebrates-victory/articleshow/120682448.cms,"The raid: How it happened

The viral video: An unsettling snapshot of a nation divided

The Trump connection

What's happening now: Arrests and deportation threats loom

In a tense and dramatic operation early Sunday, over 100 immigrants believed to be in the US illegally were arrested after a huge federal raid at an after-hours club in Colorado Springs. The raid, which involved over 300 police officers and agents from several federal agencies, was aimed at the club after months of investigation into its suspected links to drug trafficking, prostitution, and violent crime.The raid played out in dramatic fashion, with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) releasing gory video footage of agents encircling the building and ordering patrons to exit with their hands up.As agents broke a window to enter, pandemonium broke out within the club.Other videos, quickly going viral on the web, depicted dozens of people running through the entrance of the club as federal agents stormed in, making on-the-spot arrests of dozens of people. By the time the operation was over, many suspects were paraded in handcuffs, lined up on the sidewalk, waiting to be taken to detention.The raid occurred around 5 am Sunday (local time), with federal agents swooping down on the nightclub, which had been under investigation for years.The club, in Colorado Springs — the state's second-largest city, some 70 miles south of Denver — had become infamous for its illicit activities. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was brought in to take the arrested people into custody, as the DEA announced that cocaine, guns, and other contraband were seized during the operation.Jonathan Pullen, head of the DEA's Rocky Mountain Division, characterized the raid as an essential move toward eradicating harmful criminal activity in the city. ""Colorado Springs awakens this morning to a safer community today,"" Pullen said at a news conference. His statement matched the relief expressed by law enforcement authorities, who had been investigating the club for months.There were at least 200 individuals in the nightclub when it was raided, Pullen added. Among those arrested were a dozen active-duty military members, some of whom had been employed as armed security or were merely customers at the club. ""When the police arrived at the door, most of the drugs went to the floor,"" Pullen said, underscoring again the enormity of the bust. Several patrons were also taken into custody on outstanding warrants, though Pullen refused to release more information regarding the suspects' identities or the nations from which they originated.The raid's viral video, now being shared far and wide on social media, has reached an audience of millions. Its brutal imagery, agents barging into the nightclub, breaking up windows, and taking dozens into custody, has heated up heated debate.Some claim that this is an essential step in fighting the risks created by illegal activity, while others are alarmed at the implications of such a sweeping, intrusive crackdown.Sunday's action is the newest installment in President Donald Trump's hardline approach to immigration enforcement .During his second term, Trump has spearheaded an unprecedented surge against unlawful immigration, led by his administration's theatrical exercise of executive power.With a hand at detaining foreign students to limiting border crossings, Trump's policies have intensified tensions in both legal and political communities, including confrontations with federal judges who've sought to stop some of his more radical initiatives.In a rare departure from his usual bravado, Trump resorted to his social media site, Truth Social, to bask in the glory of the success of the raid. ""A big Raid last night on some of the worst people illegally in our Country — Drug Dealers, Murderers, and other Violent Criminals, of all shapes and sizes,"" Trump posted, sharing a link to the viral video clips of the thrilling operation.The DEA's video, which features agents in full tactical gear, raiding the nightclub with loudspeakers shouting orders for people to leave, quickly went viral and elicited mixed reactions. Some praised it as a necessary action to restore law and order, while others condemned the raid as excessive in scale and as unfairly targeting undocumented people.In the video, the pandemonium within the club, with customers running out and agents moving in, was visceral, a vivid contrast to the nation's continuing struggle with illegal immigration.Throughout the day, officials continued to process those rounded up in the raid. ICE officers are currently deciding who among them might be deported, but many are left in the dark about their futures.This is not the first such action on Trump's watch, and it won't probably be the last.Recent moves, such as the short-term suspension of deportations for certain individuals under the Alien Enemies Act, indicate that the court fights over immigration enforcement are only just beginning.While ICE has not specified the countries of origin for those detained, the operation is being viewed as a major part of the Trump administration’s ongoing effort to combat illegal immigration, particularly through aggressive tactics aimed at high-profile criminal operations. The sweeping nature of the raid raises broader questions about the future of immigration policy and enforcement across the country.","Over 100 immigrants believed to be in the US illegally were arrested after a huge federal raid at an after-hours club in Colorado Springs.

A 30-year-old man has been charged with multiple counts of murder after a devastating car-ramming incident at a Filipino heritage festival in Vancouver left 11 people dead and dozens injured.According to police, Kai-Ji Adam Lo , a Vancouver resident, was charged with eight counts of second-degree murder, with more charges expected soon, as per news agency AFP.The attack occurred during the Lapu Lapu Day celebrations on Saturday evening, a vibrant street festival honouring a Filipino national hero. Witnesses described horrific scenes as a black Audi SUV drove through the crowded streets, striking people between the ages of five and 65.Vancouver Police chief Steve Rai said it was ""the darkest day in Vancouver’s history,"" according to AP.Police confirmed that terrorism had been ruled out, citing Lo’s significant history of mental health issues and previous interactions with law enforcement. Rai said that Lo had a “significant history” of contact with mental health services and police.The suspect was detained at the scene by bystanders before officers took him into custody. Video footage circulating on social media, shows a man in a black hoodie surrounded by furious festivalgoers, saying ""I’m sorry"" with his hand to his head.Witnesses recounted scenes of terror. Kris Pangilinan, who operated a pop-up booth, was quoted by AP saying the SUV first moved slowly before ""slamming on the gas,"" sending bodies flying ""higher than the food trucks themselves."" Another festival-goer, Carayn Nulada, described shielding her grandchildren from the vehicle, while her daughter narrowly escaped with minor injuries.Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney , cancelling his final campaign events ahead of Monday’s election, expressed deep sorrow. ""Last night families lost a sister, a brother, a mother, a father, a son, or a daughter,"" he said tearfully. ""Those families are living every family’s nightmare"", Carney added.Meanwhile, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr also expressed his condolences, saying he was ""completely shattered"" by the tragedy. The Philippine Consulate General in Vancouver assured families that it was working closely with Canadian authorities.British Columbia premier David Eby vowed that the tragedy would not overshadow the spirit of the festival, noting the immense contributions of the Filipino community to Canadian society.Hundreds gathered for a candlelight vigil on Sunday evening, mourning the victims. Vancouver Mayor Kenneth Sim said, “I know many of us are fearful and feel uneasy,” but stressed that Vancouver ""is still a safe city.""The tragedy brought painful memories of the 2018 Toronto van attack, which killed 10 pedestrians. AFP quoted a local resident who said, ""It has occurred before, but I fear for the society that we live in, that these things can happen.""The festival, celebrating Datu Lapu-Lapu, an Indigenous Filipino leader who resisted Spanish colonisation, had attracted large crowds. Organisers had planned parades, concerts, and food fairs for the occasion, including performances by two members of the Black Eyed Peas.As the investigation continues, authorities have not yet released the names of the victims. Police expect to lay further charges as the case progresses.","Kai-Ji Adam Lo, 30, charged with eight counts of second-degree murder.

North Korea officially confirmed on Monday that it deployed troops to Russia to aid Moscow's efforts in reclaiming its Kursk region, marking Pyongyang’s first involvement in a major conflict since the Korean War.According to a statement by North Korea’s Central Military Commission, carried by state media, the deployment was made under a mutual defence treaty signed by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin in June 2024.Kim said the decision was made to “annihilate and wipe out the Ukrainian neo-Nazi occupiers and liberate the Kursk area in cooperation with the Russian armed forces,” as per news agency AP. He added, “They who fought for justice are all heroes and representatives of the honour of the motherland,” with plans underway to erect a monument in Pyongyang to honour the fallen soldiers.While North Korea did not disclose the exact number of troops sent or casualties suffered, South Korean intelligence had earlier estimated that Pyongyang dispatched between 10,000 and 12,000 troops last year, with around 4,000 reported killed or wounded.South Korea's military also assessed that about 3,000 additional North Korean troops were sent earlier this year.Despite Ukrainian forces still claiming presence in parts of Kursk, Russian chief of staff Valery Gerasimov informed President Putin on Saturday that Russian forces, aided by North Korean troops, had fully reclaimed the region. Gerasimov praised the North Koreans for their ""high professionalism, fortitude, courage and heroism in battle"".However, Ukraine’s general staff countered these claims, insisting that defensive operations continued in Kursk. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also reiterated on Sunday that Ukrainian forces were ""maintaining our presence on Russian territory,"" according to news agency AFP.Experts believe North Korea’s public acknowledgement was pre-agreed with Russia. Yang Moo-jin, president of the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, was quoted by AFP as saying that Pyongyang likely calculated that the benefits of Russian compensation outweighed potential damage to its international image.Meanwhile, diplomatic efforts to end the ongoing war are intensifying. US President Donald Trump and Zelenskyy discussed a possible ceasefire during their meeting in Vatican City over the weekend. Trump, who previously expressed confidence in brokering peace, later expressed doubts about Putin’s willingness to end the conflict.North Korea’s deepening involvement with Russia has raised concerns in Washington and Seoul. There are fears Moscow could reward Pyongyang with advanced military technology, boosting its nuclear weapons program. South Korean and Western intelligence agencies have also warned of the extensive arms supplies North Korea has been providing to Russia.",North Korea confirms it sent troops to Russia to help reclaim its Kursk region. It is Pyongyang's first involvement in a major conflict since the Korean War.

Steve Bannon says Trump would get a third term easily if he does this,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/steve-bannon-says-trump-would-get-a-third-term-easily-if-he-does-this/articleshow/120652923.cms,"Steve Bannon says Trump has many options to run for president again in 2028.

Poll Do you believe Trump should run for a third term? No, he has had enough time Yes, he deserves another chance

President Donald Trump's former adviser Steve Bannon said the Constitution that bars one from being the president more than twice can't stop Trump from serving a third term if he starts millionaire tax that would tax the rich but would help him. “This is being fought behind closed doors right now, and I’m telling you, with the massive tax cut, in addition, he’s going to give the working class and the middle class, the math only works out if you actually increase taxes on the wealthy,” the former Trump adviser said on NewsNation suggesting that a system where the rich takes care of the middle class would sustain Trump in power.“The Democrats never raised taxes on oligarchs, never raised taxes on Wall Street, never took away carried interest. The Democratic Party is absolutely beholden to the billionaires, the oligarchs,” Bannon said. “Trump’s the only person ever stood for the working class.”“And this, this massive tax cut, which the Democrats never did, to take the attacks away from a Social Security, take tax away from tips, take tax away from overtime for working class people, is the first time that the working class has got an additional tax cut from everybody else, and Trump’s fighting for that,” he argued.Trump for 2028 sounds like an impossible idea but has been reinforced time and again with a little push from the president himself, as he is not dismissing the talks but providing a little fuel. His organization came up with Trump 2028 hats and T-shirts this week as he asserted he is serious about running for president in 2028 too.""No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once,"" says the 22nd Amendment.But an easy shortcut is to run for the vice president in 2018 with JD Vance running for president. If they win, JD Vance can step down making way for the vice president to become the president.In an interview with TIME magazine published on Friday, Trump said there are ""some loopholes that have been discussed"" to allow him to serve a third term. However, he said he does not ""believe in using loopholes.""On being directly asked whether he would run as a running mate to JD Vance in 2028, he said, ""I don’t know anything about, what, look, all I can say is this, I am being inundated with requests. I'm doing a good job. Great physical exam, and unlike every other president, I took the cognitive test and I aced it 100% and I bet you guys couldn't get 100% on that exam. It's a tough exam. You know, when you get into the mid questions, it gets to be pretty tricky and pretty tough, and the last questions are very tough, and I aced it. And I guarantee, I'd give you, I'd make a big, beautiful bet that you guys couldn't ace it. But anyway. But look, it's good to have you, it’s a very nasty interview. They don’t ask any of the good things.""","Bannon said the Constitution that bars one from being the president more than twice can't stop Trump from serving a third term if he starts millionaire tax that would tax the rich but would help him. “The Democratic Party is absolutely beholden to the billionaires, the oligarchs,” the former Trump adviser said on NewsNation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120652924,imgsize-26150,width-400,resizemode-4/Steve-Bannon-says-Trump-has-many-options-to-run-for-president-again-in-2028-.jpg"

And I want him to sign it,” he added.This comes following the US President's meeting with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the sidelines of Pope Francis’s funeral.After meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Rome, Trump took to Truth Social to criticise Russian President Vladimir Putin for recent attacks on civilian areas in Ukraine.“There was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities, and towns over the last few days,” Trump wrote. “It makes me think that maybe he doesn’t want to stop the war—he’s just stringing me along—and has to be dealt with differently, through ‘Banking’ or ‘Secondary Sanctions’?

Twenty years ago this month, President George W Bush landed in Rome to pay his respects to a deceased pope, John Paul II. He was the first sitting president to attend a papal funeral . But he was not alone: He had asked his predecessor, Bill Clinton , to ride along on Air Force One, along with his father, George HW Bush.Together, the three presidents sped to St Peter's Basilica. Kneeling, they prayed side by side before the pope's body.It was a remarkable display of American bipartisan unity , the kind of kinship among political rivals that feels unimaginable today. And things played out differently when President Donald Trump landed in Rome on Friday night to attend Pope Francis' funeral. He was accompanied by his wife, Melania, and a clutch of senior aides. But his predecessor, former President Joe Biden , and his wife, Jill, flew in on their own.Considering Trump had recently stripped Biden of his security clearances and regularly denounces him, it is understandable they did not share a ride to Rome. When former President Jimmy Carter died in Dec, Trump said he had passed away ""a happy man"" in the knowledge that ""he wasn't the worst. President Joe Biden was.""Biden has often talked about his Roman Catholic upbringing. He saw Francis briefly in Italy in June, weeks before the disastrous debate with Trump that led to his decision to drop out of the race. Biden had talked about returning to Rome to get the pope's blessing before leaving the White House, but he cancelled the trip because of the Los Angeles wildfires in Jan.Asked on the flight to Rome whether he planned to talk with Biden at the funeral, Trump sounded surprised his predecessor was attending. ""It's not high on my list,"" he said. ""It's really not."" The contrast was stark. Bush was eager to ensure Clinton was part of the full presidential party. Not only did the two men attend the funeral together, Clinton sat in on the highly classified presidential daily brief on the flight over.","President George W Bush was the first sitting president to attend a papal funeral.

Why a 4-year-old and a 7-year-old were deported to Honduras



Donald Trump's border czar Tom Homan said having a child born in the US does not make the parents immune from the punishment of entering the country illegally. Homan said Sunday on CBS News's 'Face the Nation', as the deportation of a four-year-old child with cancer has become the most controversial on of the Trump administration.Reacting to this particular case of deportation, Homan said he was not aware of the specifics but no US citizen child was deported. ""Deported means you got to be ordered deported by an immigration judge. We don't deport US citizens.""When Homan was told that the child's mother was deported, Homan said, ""The mother chose to take the children with her. ""When you enter the country legally, and you know you're here illegally, and you choose to have a U.S. citizen child, that's on you. That's not on this administration. If you choose to put your family in that position, that's on them. But having a U.S. citizen child after you enter this country illegally. It's not a get out of jail free card. It doesn't make me- make you immune from our laws. If that's the message we sent the entire world, women are gonna keep putting themselves at risk and come to this country. We send a message. You can enter country illegally, which is a crime. That's okay. You can have due process, great taxpayer expense. Get ordered removed. That's okay. Don't leave.

The children and their mother were put on a flight to Honduras on Friday, the same day another child with US citizenship, a 2-year-old girl, was sent to that country with her undocumented mother. Lawyers for both families said the mothers were not given an option to leave their children in the United States before they were deported.","Trump's border czar Tom Homan said having a child born in the US does not make the parents immune from the punishment of entering the country illegally. The deportation of a four-year-old child with cancer has become the most controversial on of the Trump administration. ""Deported means you got to be ordered deported by an immigration judge. We don't deport US citizens,"" he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120676176,imgsize-30666,width-400,resizemode-4/Trumps-border-czar-Tom-Homan-said-giving-birth-to-children-who-are-US-citizens-does-not-make-illegal-alien-parents-immune-from-punishment-.jpg"
"Vancouver car attack suspect has extensive mental health history, reveals cop",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/vancouver-car-attack-suspect-has-extensive-mental-health-history-reveals-cop/articleshow/120675357.cms,"11 killed as a vehicle plows into a Filipino street festival crowd in Vancouver.

No prior indication of threat level



The Vancouver Police Sunday said the crazed driver who mowed down at least 11 people with his black SUV and injured several others at a Lapu Lapu Day party had an extensive mental health history. Interim police chief Steve Rai said the 30-year-old man was known to police under certain circumstances hinting at his past run-ins with the law enforcement, and also an extensive history of interactions with mental health professionals, he said, adding that this was the darkest day in the city's history.""There are many things that we still don't know. But we are looking for the answers,"" Rai said.The identity of the suspect has not yet been revealed, though a purported video of the suspect surfaced on social media, which was believed to have been taken after the crowd detained the man until the cops arrived. From the video, social media users surmised that the suspect might be of Asian origin, but a resident of Vancouver. The motive is still not known, though the cops confirmed that he acted alone and it was not a terrorist act.""I am unable to identify the person as charges have not yet been laid,"" the police said.Lapu Lapu Day is named after an Indigenous resistance fighter in the Philippines who fought against Spanish colonization in the 16th century. Saturday's event was the second annual street celebration of the day in Vancouver, and organizers had said it was an opportunity to mark ""the enduring impact on Filipino values, notably the spirit of bayanihan — the collective community effort.""The festival was just winding down when the SUV drove through the crowd but there were a lot of people. The driver was travelling eastbound on 43rd Street before the attack and the vehicle was owned by somebody associated to that family.The activities associated with the festival were being held on the grounds of a high school, not accessible by road. The only road that “required partial closure” was behind the school for food trucks, police said, and there were “no barriers” restricting access for those trucks. There was no indicator that needed to respond to a higher threat level, police said.","Vancouver Police say the driver had an extensive mental health history.

In a bizarre incident, a female passenger of a Southwest Airlines flight took her clothes off and pooped on her seat, prompting the airlines authorities to call the police as the flight landed in Chicago. According to a statement from Southwest Airlines, flight 418 from Philadelphia to Chicago's Midway Airport was met by law enforcement and medical personnel who responded to ""a situation involving a customer.""""Our Teams are reaching out to those onboard to apologize for the situation and any delays to their travel plans,"" the airline said in a statement to NBC New York. ""Nothing is more important to Southwest than the safety of our customers and employees, and we appreciate the professionalism of our flight crew.""While the plane was grounded and taken out of service for cleaning, it was not clear what happened to the passenger.Southwest Airlines recently encountered a similar incident of a passenger stripping and shouting on a Phoenix-bound plane. The incident took place in March on a flight from Houston to Phoenix. Two passengers told 12News the aircraft had just started taxiing when the woman, while fully clothed, walked to the front of the plane and started yelling. The woman apparently wanted to get off the flight. She started screaming and jumping. As the plane continued to move, she started to undress herself.People on the flight said they tried to remain calm and not pay attention to what was happening. Then at one point during the incident, one passenger said the naked woman went after a flight attendant, rubbing her naked body all over the flight attendant. The aircraft then returned back to the gate. When the door opened, another airline worker boarded the plane and covered the woman with a blanket. The flight was delayed for just more than an hour before it was able to take off for Phoenix.","A female passenger of a Southwest Airlines flight took her clothes off and pooped on her seat.
