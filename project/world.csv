NEW DELHI: Seven people were killed and several others were injured in a powerful accidental explosion at the Nowgam police station on the outskirts of Srinagar According to officials, the blast occurred while a police and forensic team was examining explosive material seized from Faridabad, part of the 2,900 kg chemical cache recovered from an arrested doctor in the case.The explosion caused successive smaller blasts and damaged the police station.The explosion happened late Friday night during sampling of explosives stored at the Nowgam police station, the primary station handling the Faridabad terror module case. The police officials have said whether the blast was pre-planned or accidental will be determined in further investigation.Over two dozen injured, mostly police personnelAt least 27 people — including 24 police personnel and three civilians — were injured, many of whom are undergoing treatment in Srinagar hospitals for burn injuries and blast trauma. Officials said the explosion is linked to the same chain of events that led to the unravelling of a major terror module.The explosive material being examined had been transported from Faridabad, Haryana. It was part of the cache seized during the investigation into the white-collar terror module. The seized explosives, had exposed a “white-collar terror module” linked to Jaish-e-Mohammed and Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind operating across Kashmir, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh.Investigators had earlier seized 360 kg of chemicals — ammonium nitrate, potassium nitrate, sulphur and other materials — from a rented residence linked to arrested doctor Muzammil Ganaie. Approximately 3,000 kilograms of explosives and bomb-making equipment stored by this module was also seized.The midnight blast shattered windows, damaged the station structure and disrupted the quiet of the neighbourhood as ambulances and police vehicles rushed to the site.The terror module came under the police radar when posters threatening security forces appeared on walls in Bunpora, Nowgam, in mid-October. This prompted Srinagar Police to register a case on October 19.Frame-by-frame scrutiny of CCTV footage helped identify three suspects — Arif Nisar Dar alias Sahil, Yasir-ul-Ashraf and Maqsood Ahmad Dar alias Shahid. All three had past stone-pelting cases and were seen pasting the posters.Interrogation of the trio led to the arrest of Maulvi Irfan Ahmad, a former paramedic-turned-Imam from Shopian. According to PTI, he allegedly supplied the posters and radicalised young doctors by leveraging his access to the medical community.The trail then led investigators to Al Falah University in Faridabad, where doctors Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie and Shaheen Sayeed were arrested. The massive explosive haul was seized there.Police believe the core of the module consisted of three doctors: Dr Muzammil Ganaie,Dr Umar Nabi, Dr Muzzaffar Rather. A fourth doctor, Dr Adeel Rather, was arrested separately after an AK-56 rifle was recovered from him. His role is under investigation.The blast comes four days after a deadly car explosion in Delhi, which killed at least 13 people. According to CCTV footage, the car in which the Red Fort explosion occurred was being driven by Umar, a member of this module. According to agency sources, Umar fled as he panicked by the successful crackdown of security forces and his anxiety and desperation likely led to the explosion near Red Fort.(With agency inputs)","Blast occurred while a police and forensic team was examining explosive material seized from Faridabad.

NEW DELHI: Nine people were killed and several others sustained injuries after an explosion at the Nowgam police station in the outskirts of Srinagar.According to PTI, the blast took place when the police and forensic team officials were extracting samples from a massive cache of explosives recently seized in connection with the 'white-collar' terror module case.The material had been brought from Faridabad, Haryana, and was part of the 360 kg of explosive chemicals recovered from the rented residence of arrested doctor Muzammil Ganaie, officials said, PTI reported.The bodies have been shifted to the Police Control Room in Srinagar. At least 24 police personnel and three civilians have been admitted to various hospitals across the city, the officials said.Five of the injured are in critical condition, and officials warned that the toll may rise.The massive explosion shattered the quiet of the night and caused significant damage to the police station building. Ambulances and police vehicles rushed to the scene, with sirens piercing the air as the injured were taken to nearby hospitals.Small successive explosions after the initial blast briefly delayed rescue operations by the bomb disposal squad. While some of the seized explosives are stored at the police forensic lab, officials said the bulk of the 360 kg cache was being kept at the Nowgam police station, where the primary case linked to the terror module is registered.The terror module was uncovered after threatening posters targeting police and security forces appeared on walls in Bunpora, Nowgam, in mid-October. Srinagar Police registered a case on October 19 and formed a special team to investigate.A detailed CCTV analysis led to the arrest of Arif Nisar Dar alias Sahil, Yasir-ul-Ashraf, and Maqsood Ahmad Dar alias Shahid, all previously booked in stone-pelting cases—who were seen pasting the posters.Their interrogation pointed to Maulvi Irfan Ahmad, a former paramedic-turned-Imam from Shopian, accused of supplying the posters and radicalising the doctors.The probe eventually led police to Al Falah University in Faridabad, where doctors Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie and Shaheen Sayeed were arrested, and where investigators seized the 360 kg of suspected ammonium nitrate, along with 2,900 kg of IED-making material, including chemicals, detonators, wires, and other bomb-making components, were seized.Earlier this week, a powerful blast ripped through a Hyundai i20 near Delhi’s Red Fort, leaving at least 13 dead and several others injured.","The blast took place when the police and forensic team officials were extracting samples from a massive cache of explosives.

SRINAGAR: Security forces triggered three controlled explosions early Friday to raze the family home of Delhi 'suicide bomber' Dr Umar un-Nabi in his native Koil village of south Kashmir's Pulwama district, coinciding with the start of an operation by J&K Police to map potential sources of cars that could be ""misused for unlawful activities"".The plan to demolish Umar's home involved evacuating his kin and residents of nearby houses before using explosives to reduce the two-storey structure to rubble between 12.30am and 2.30am. Around a dozen houses in the vicinity suffered some damage, residents alleged.J&K CM Omar Abdullah warned that ""such actions"" would only fuel anger. ""If terrorism could be stopped by these actions, it would have ended long ago,"" he told reporters in Jammu. ""But these decisions are not in our hands. Those taking these decisions should reflect on whether they have succeeded in stopping terrorism through these methods.""Omar said terrorism did decline in J&K not too long ago ""without the need to blow up anyone's home"".National Conference's Srinagar-Budgam MP Aga Ruhullah Mehdi called the demolition ""collective punishment"" for Umar's act of blowing up his explosives-laden car in the middle of rush-hour traffic near Delhi's Red Fort last Monday, killing 13 people and wounding many.The Faridabad-based doctor had been reported missing since his associate's arrest on suspicion of working for a JeM terror module.""Making an entire family homeless during the harsh winter of Kashmir without evidence/court order or any law linking them to the attack is an act of cruelty. It doesn't bring justice to the innocent lives that we lost in the terror attack, and it doesn't achieve the ends of justice,"" Mehdi said.""Hold the actual perpetrators accountable through lawful investigation. Mass detentions, coercive interrogations and illegal demolitions will not bring peace; they will drag Kashmir back by decades,"" he warned.PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti said the govt must act strictly against the perpetrators of terror attacks instead of their families. ""We are not against action being taken against those involved. But targeting their friends, relatives, parents and siblings?"" she said in Budgam.The crackdown on possible attempts by terror modules to procure vehicles for terror attacks such as the one in Delhi took police teams to car dealers across the Valley.In Pulwama district, cops visited multiple vehicle dealerships and fertiliser and chemical outlets to check sales records for anything suspicious.""We are trying to curb potential misuse, strengthen regulatory compliance, and ensure transparency in the sale and distribution of vehicles and chemicals. The focus is on verifying end-user details to prevent any possibility of vehicles or chemicals being diverted for unlawful activities,"" an officer said.Car dealers in Shopian also had police teams visiting them to check their transaction records, Aadhaar details, phone numbers and other personal particulars of each buyer and seller. Used-car and scrap dealers are also under scrutiny.In Awantipora, south of Srinagar, the administration attached the home of a member of the separatist Jammu and Kashmir People's League. The owner, identified as Mohd Yaqoob Sheikh of Namblabal Pampore, is suspected to be in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.""The property attachment, carried out after due legal approval, marks a significant step in ongoing efforts to dismantle secessionist networks and curb unlawful activities posing a threat to national security,"" police said.","Security forces trigger three controlled explosions to raze the family home of Delhi'suicide bomber' Dr Umar un-Nabi in his native Koil village of south Kashmir's Pulwama district.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday took serious view of an alleged attempt by a ""revered member of the higher judiciary"" to influence a judicial member of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), Chennai, and said the matter will be dealt with appropriately on the administrative side by CJI B R Gavai.Hours after the hearing, CJI Gavai told TOI that he was examining documents. ""I will take an appropriate decision soon,"" he said.

NEW DELHI: Two days after the deadly car blast near Delhi’s Red Fort, new revelations from the family of arrested doctor Shaheen Sayeed have added a personal dimension to the ongoing terror investigation.Speaking to PTI in Lucknow, Mohammad Shoaib, Shaheen’s elder brother, has said the family is in “complete disbelief” over her alleged link to terrorist activities. He added that they were still struggling to come to terms with the accusations.He confirmed that the police and Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) officials had searched their home but behaved respectfully.“They searched the house and asked questions normally, the same way you are asking me now,” Shoaib said.“Neither my father nor I were treated harshly. There was no pressure or force used to make us say anything. They only asked about when my sister stopped visiting us.”Shoaib revealed that the family had not been in contact with Shaheen for the past four years. However, their parents occasionally called to check on her well-being.“We have had no contact. It’s been four years since we last spoke. Parents will naturally call their children to ask how they are doing.I am her elder brother, of course, I would also worry about her. Isn’t that normal?” he said.When asked if he had ever visited her residence near IIM Road in Lucknow, Shoaib replied: “No, I have never gone there. I only knew that she has a house somewhere along the IIM Road. I don’t even know the exact location.”He said there was never any reason to suspect her of wrongdoing.“Even when she was studying medicine, there was never any sign of her being involved in anything suspicious. I still don’t believe these allegations. As I have said before, I simply cannot believe it,” he said.Shaheen’s former husband, Dr Zafar Hayat, who lives in Kanpur, also expressed shock over her alleged role in the case. He said he learned about her arrest only a day earlier.Hayat and Shaheen married in November 2003 and got divorced in 2012. Both were doctors, and he recalled her as “a loving mother and caring person.”“Our divorce took place towards the end of 2012. I am not sure what was on her mind that led to it. There was never any dispute or quarrel between us. She was a loving and caring person,” he said.“I never had any inkling that she could be involved in such activities. She was deeply attached to her family and children, loved them immensely and took care of their studies,” Hayat added.Recalling their marriage, he said: “I had never seen her in a burqa. She only wore it during the wedding rituals. I have no idea about her alleged involvement in any terror activities now being reported. Our divorce happened long ago, in 2012, and if she got involved in something later, I know nothing about it.”He also remembered a conversation they once had about settling abroad.Dr Hayat recalled that Shaheen had once suggested settling in Australia or Europe for better pay and quality of life; however, he told her that they already had good jobs and a comfortable life in India, surrounded by family and friends.Hayat said he was unaware that Shaheen had returned to India and maintained that she showed no signs of any extremist beliefs during their years together.According to investigators, Dr Shaheen Sayeed, associated with Al-Falah University in Faridabad, was among those arrested following Monday’s explosion near the Red Fort.Police suspect she was linked to Dr Muzammil Ganaie, another faculty member at the same university, alleged to be part of a “white-collar terror module” with ties to Jaish-e-Mohammed and Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind.Authorities said the module spread across Kashmir, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh was exposed after the recovery of 2,900 kg of explosives and the arrest of eight people, including three doctors from Al-Falah University.Investigators claim that Shaheen headed Jaish-e-Mohammed’s women’s recruitment wing, Jamaat-ul-Mominat in India.Her father, Syed Ahmad Ansari also expressed shock at the allegations.“I last spoke to Shaheen about a month ago. I have never heard her mention Dr Muzammil or anyone involved in such activities,” he said.Her father added that she had completed her medical studies in Prayagraj.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) is probing the Red Fort blast which police said was caused by a high-intensity explosive device planted in a car.Investigations by police teams across Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh are continuing into the wider multi-state module.The explosion occurred around 7 pm on Monday at the Subhash Marg traffic signal, near the Red Fort Metro Station. The high-intensity blast ripped through a slow-moving Hyundai i20 car, killing at least 12 people and injuring several others.","Mohammad Shoaib, Shaheen Sayeed’s elder brother, said the family is in “complete disbelief” over her alleged link to terrorist activities. He confirmed that the police and Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) officials had searched their home but behaved respectfully. Dr Zafar Hayat, her former husband, said he learned about her arrest only a day earlier.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125272443,imgsize-633640,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

'No Remorse, God Provoked Me': Lawyer Rakesh Kishore Defends His Shoe Attack On CJI BR Gavai

NEW DELHI: Admitting that Supreme Court failed its citizens, and it is the vigilance of civil society and courage of ordinary people which have kept the judiciary accountable over the years, the CJI termed SC's 1979 verdict as a ""moment of institutional embarrassment"" which acquitted two policemen accused of raping a young tribal girl inside a police station by taking her ""consent"" as voluntary because there were no visible marks of physical resistance.Delivering the 30th Justice Sunanda Bhandare Memorial Lecture, CJI B R Gavai said the apex court's verdict in Tukaram v. State of Maharashtra, also known as the Mathura case, was an institutional failure, and court's verdict reflected a deeply regressive and patriarchal understanding of consent, effectively denying the social context of power, coercion, and vulnerability in which sexual violence often occurs.""In my view, this decision remains one of the most troubling moments in India's constitutional and judicial history, and I call it a 'moment of institutional embarrassment', where the legal system failed to protect the dignity of the very person it was meant to safeguard. Yet, this judgment also became a turning point. The public outrage and the nationwide protests that followed, led by women's groups, students, and legal activists, ignited the modern Indian women's rights movement.It compelled the nation to confront the inadequacies of its criminal law and catalysed the amendments in criminal law, which redefined the concept of consent and strengthened legal protections against custodial rape,"" CJI Gavai said.The CJI was speaking on the evolution of law in building a gender equal and inclusive India. He said many pathbreaking laws were passed to bring gender justice, and courts also pitched in to ensure equality through judicial pronouncements, barring few exceptions like the 1979 verdict. He said it resulted in dismantling of the structural inequalities embedded in family and custom, bringing women from the margins of dependency to the centre of constitutional citizenship.""Over the past 75 years, India has charted an extraordinary journey in advancing the rights of women and shaping the vision of an inclusive society. From the early struggles for recognition and equality, to the present era of intersectional and participatory justice, the courts have often stood as guardians of equality and human dignity. This evolution has not been without its challenges. There have been moments when judicial interpretations failed to capture the lived realities of women or fell short of the transformative spirit of the Constitution. .. However, the vigilance of civil society, the persistence of women's movements, and the courage of ordinary citizens have together kept the judiciary accountable to the constitutional promise of equality,"" he said.""Therefore, it is important to acknowledge that progress in gender justice has never been the achievement of courts alone. The collective voice of citizens has ensured that regressive precedents were questioned, debated, and ultimately corrected through reform, reinterpretation, or legislative intervention. The dialogue between the courts and the people thus remains one of the most vital sources of India's democratic strength, reminding us that the march toward gender equality is not a destination reached, but a commitment constantly renewed,"" CJI Gavai said.",CJI B R Gavai said Supreme Court's 1979 rape verdict was an institutional failure. He said it reflected a deeply regressive and patriarchal understanding of consent. The public outrage and nationwide protests that followed ignited the modern Indian women's rights movement.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125285031,imgsize-609522,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-67.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Umar Un Nabi, confirmed by a DNA test as the bomber in Old Delhi, and his module had planned to carry out a ""spectacular terror attack "" with multiple vehicle-borne IEDs followed by firing with assault rifles. They had procured three vehicles - an i20, a red Ford Ecosport and a Brezza - for their mission, sources in the security establishment said on Wednesday.While the i20 exploded, cops issued a BOLO (be on the lookout) notice for the other two cars, an indication that more explosives may have been hidden by the module. The Ecosport, which has a Delhi registration number ending in 0458, was located Wednesday in Faridabad.A search is on for the Brezza. The cars were allegedly procured by Umar.The probe so far has revealed that besides Delhi, they were planning to target Ayodhya too. An attempt was to be made on Nov 25 during the hoisting of a saffron flag atop the Ram temple, said a source in a security agency. The suspects have revealed they were planning to use, and had collected, a mixture of ammonium nitrate and RDX, but it's unclear if that was the explosive in the car.The plot was hatched in Turkiye way back in 2022. As reported by TOI on Wednesday, Umar was acting on instructions from his Turkiye-based handler, identified by his codename Ukasa.A day after a car blast killed a dozen people near Red Fort, home minister Amit Shah chaired a set of meetings with the security brass and instructed agencies to hunt down every culprit behind the act.""Everyone involved in this act will face the full wrath of our agencies,"" Shah posted on X after the meetings.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the home minister from Bhutan and was briefed by the latter on all aspects of the blast, including the investigation updates. President Droupadi Murmu, who is in Angola, also spoke to Shah over the phone to enquire about the blast.The home minister on Tuesday decided to hand over the investigation into the incident to the National Investigation Agency (NIA). This points to a terror angle, though sources said it may have more to do with the Jaish terror module member linked to the blast.With Dr Umar, who had escaped the recent crackdown on the Faridabad module, suspected to be the car bomber, Shah has asked the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) to match the DNA sample collected from the body found in the i20 car used for the blast with those of Dr Umar's family members.Sources in the J&K security establishment told TOI that DNA samples collected from Dr Umar's family members had been despatched to Delhi. Shah has asked FSL officials to complete the exercise at the earliest. The NIA was instructed to submit a report at the earliest, detailing the preliminary findings.Tuesday's review meetings by Shah were attended by home secretary Govind Mohan, director of Intelligence Bureau Tapan Deka, Delhi Police commissioner Satish Golcha and NIA DG Sadanand Vasant Date.DGP of Jammu and Kashmir Nalin Prabhat joined the meeting virtually.During the meetings, top officials gave detailed presentations on the situation in the aftermath of the blast, the sources said.","Umar Un Nabi, confirmed by a DNA test as the bomber in Old Delhi, and his module had planned to carry out a ""spectacular terror attack "" with multiple vehicle- borne IEDs.

""Climate change is a lie""— a person who never opened a science book.

Over 99% of climate scientists globally endorse the reality and human causation of climate change, based on the most comprehensive recent literature reviews. This near-unanimity underscores the urgency for action, as affirmed by bodies like the IPCC and national academies.

I mean even if you think climate change is a hoax, don’t you still care about taking care of the environment?

People are still trying to deny that climate change is real?!

Poorly educated people are put in trump's cabinet in an attempt to make trump seem smart.

Karoline Leavitt stirred a fresh row after claiming that climate change is “based on a fallacy."" Environmental activists were not very happy with White House Press Secretary's comments.Leavitt made the remark during an appearance on Fox News while attacking California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom. Leavitt accused him of damaging the state with environmental policies she mocked as the “Green New Scam”. She said, “Gavin has done so much damage to his state, with the ‘Green New Scam’ and with this utopian pursuit of climate change that is just so false, it's built on a fallacy, and he's built up energy costs [so much] that people are fleeing the state. ” Her comments run counter to the overwhelming scientific consensus on global warming.Recently, Congress released tens of thousands of Jeffrey Epstein’s emails, which implicated that US President Trump knew about Epstein and the 'underage girls' in the sex trafficker's house. Democratic lawmakers have also advanced a petition to the White House demanding that even more related records be made public.","Leavitt made the remark during an appearance on Fox News while attacking California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom.

The Donald Trump administration has been shaken by the new revelations that came to the fore regarding sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The Democrats released email correspondence of Epstein to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. The emails reveal that Epstein was in touch with many celebrities, both friends and enemies of Donald Trump and he spoke with them on a wide range of issues.The emails do not implicate the named celebrities of any wrongdoing. Some of the prominent names who exchanged mails with Epstein are:David Blaine is an illusionist whose name cropped up as he exchanged emails with Epstein. In one undated letter to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services, Blaine wrote in support of a visa for ""an amazing fashion model"" he had met. In a brief October 2016 email, Epstein wrote, “dinner with woody sun?” to which Blaine responded, “Great.”Barak allegedly discussed Middle Eastern politics with Epstein. They coordinated meetings, including notes about his availability in August 2015 and discussions of intellectual material circulating among Epstein’s social circle.Between 2015 and 2017, Epstein and Noam Chomsky apparently exchanged emails discussing about politics, world affairs and linguistics.They also discussed President Donald Trump and his incoming administration in 2016.Messages between Epstein and Peter Thiel —co-founder of PayPal and billionaire Republican donor —suggested intermittent contact, with Epstein writing in one email in May 2014, “That was fun, see you in 3 weeks.”In November 2016, Epstein and Indian-American author Deepak Chopra exchanged emails. Epstein shared a link to a news article on how Katie Johnson, who accused Donald Trump of raping her when she was aged 13 at an alleged Epstein “sex party,” abruptly dropped her civil lawsuit. Chopra asked Epstein whether Katie dropped the civil case against Epstein also.Journalist and author Michael Wolff and Epstein exchanged emails on various issues, including news reports on Epstein. He told Wolff in an email that Clinton was never there on the island, infamously known as Epstein Island.Summers served as Treasury Secretary in the Bill Clinton Administration from 1999 to 2001 and as Director of the White House National Economic Council in the Barack Obama Administration from 2009 to 2010.Summers criticized Trump in his mail exchanges with Epstein. In October 2017, he wrote that Trump was the “world s luckiest guy in terms of opposition, economy etc.”Epstein and Andrew exchanged emails on Virginia Giuffre, who accused Andrew of raping him when she was a minor and she used to work for Epstein. Epstein forwarded “the Duke” an email in March 2011 about an upcoming Daily Mail story about Giuffre’s allegations against Andrew. “The Duke” wrote back: “What? I don’t know any of this. How are you responding?” “Just got it two minutes ago. I’ve asked g lawyers to send a letter,” Epstein said. “I’m not sure how to respond, the only person she didn’t have sex with was Elvis.”The then New York Times reporter emailed Epstein about the Giuffre case to which Epstein wrote back that her allegations against Andrew were delusional.Former White House counsel Kathryn Ruemmler, who served in the Obama Administration, exchanged emails with Epstein, many of which revolved around personal conversations.Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon and Epstein exchanged emails on Trump, Andrew, and Virginia Giuffre.Epstein wrote to Siegal in 2011 over Giuffre's story.

NEW DELHI: New CCTV visuals from inside Lal Quila Metro Station reveal the underground station shaking and commuters running in panic during the car blast near the Red Fort on November 10, which killed 13 people and injured several others. Delhi Police have stepped up digital surveillance, closely monitoring social media platforms to track conversations, reactions, and potential leads related to the Red Fort blast, officials said on Friday.Multiple specialised teams are working round-the-clock to scan posts, comments, videos, and online discussions to identify signs of radicalisation, misinformation, provocation, or any suspicious activity emerging in the aftermath of the blast, a source added.A senior officer stated that intelligence collected by these social media monitoring units will be promptly shared with field teams for verification and appropriate action.The Delhi Police Special Cell has filed a fresh FIR to probe what it claims was a “deeper conspiracy” behind the attack. While the first FIR, registered under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), was transferred to the National Investigation Agency (NIA), the Special Cell’s FIR invokes sections of criminal conspiracy and reportedly aims to make arrests soon.Explosive experts are yet to provide a full analysis of the device, but initial reports suggest that Umar Un Nabi, who was driving the car at the time of the explosion, may have used military-grade explosives.Investigators traced his movements using CCTV footage: while travelling on the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway, he stopped near a dhaba but did not eat, slept in his car, and on the day of the blast, briefly stopped at a shop in Wazirpur for tea without interacting with anyone.The investigation has also spotlighted a so-called “doctor module” allegedly linked to the blast. Two doctors were detained from Haryana’s Nuh district — one an MBBS graduate from China who recently completed an internship at Al-Falah University, and another also associated with the university.In the past week, five suspects, including three MBBS doctors, a fertiliser vendor, and an imam, were taken into custody from Nuh, previously known as Mewat. Suspicious numbers on their mobile phones, including some from Pakistan and Gulf countries, are being scrutinized.Sources suggest that ammonium nitrate, possibly used in the blast, was procured from Nuh, where Umar and his colleague Muzammil were reportedly present on multiple occasions.The doctor module reportedly used sophisticated spycraft techniques, such as drafting emails in shared accounts without sending them, using the Threema messaging app (which operates without phone numbers or emails), and possibly creating private servers to exchange maps and locations.","New CCTV visuals from inside Lal Quila Metro Station reveal the underground station shaking and commuters running in panic during the car blast.

CHANDIGARH: A doctor working at a hospital in Pathankot has been detained in connection with the Delhi blast. Sources said he was picked up from White Medical College in Pathankot on Friday.He is an MBBS, MS doctor. The hospital is run by politician Swaran Salaria, who last year switched from the BJP to the Aam Aadmi Party.An official told TOI that the doctor was detained for questioning by investigators probing the Delhi blast after it emerged that he had been in touch with one of the accused in the case. “One of the accused had called him on the phone,” the official said.“The doctor had earlier worked with Al-Falah University in 2021–22. He also worked at Jamia Hamdard University in Delhi. He started working with White Medical College in 2024,” the official said. He is said to be 44 years old.Salaria, when contacted, said, “He has not been arrested. His family members—his son, daughter, wife and parents—live with him on the college campus. He may have been suspected of having a role and may be questioned in the course of the inquiry, but he has not been arrested.”Salaria, who is Punjab AAP vice-president and chairman of the Punjab State Rajput Welfare Board, said the doctor may have been taken for questioning since he “hails from Srinagar” and had earlier worked with Al-Falah University.Salaria added, “He has been with us for two years and this was his third year with us.”","An official said the doctor was detained for questioning after it emerged that he had been in touch with one of the accused in the case.

BBC Apologises For Documentary Slip; Rejects Trump’s $1 BILLION Claim





After the BBC came under scrutiny for editing Donald Trump’s 6 January 2021 speech, the US President announced that he plans to take legal action against the broadcaster.The BBC apologised for the edit, saying it had ""unintentionally given the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action,"" but the corporation said it would not offer financial compensation. The controversy also led to the resignations of BBC director general Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness.However, speaking to reporters on Air Force One on Friday evening, Trump said, ""We'll sue them for anywhere between $1bn and $5bn probably sometime next week."" He added, ""I think I have to do it. They cheated. They changed the words coming out of my mouth,"" as quoted by BBC.Trump said he had not yet discussed the issue with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer but planned to call him over the weekend.Earlier in the week, his lawyers had warned the BBC they would sue for $1 billion unless it retracted the edit, apologised and compensated him.The BBC’s apology came hours after a second similarly edited clip, broadcast on Newsnight in 2022, was reported by the Daily Telegraph. In its Corrections and Clarifications section, the BBC said, ""We accept that our edit unintentionally created the impression that we were showing a single continuous section of the speech, rather than excerpts from different points in the speech, and that this gave the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action.A BBC spokesperson said lawyers had responded to a letter from Trump’s team and added, ""While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim."" The broadcaster also outlined five main arguments explaining why it believed it did not have a case to answer.In an interview aired on GB News on Saturday, recorded before he confirmed his intention to sue, Trump said, ""I've been doing this for a long time, I've never seen anything like that. That's, that's the most egregious. I think that was worse than the Kamala thing with CBS and 60 Minutes.""He added, ""I think I have an obligation to do it. If you don't do it, you don't stop it from happening again with other people.""In July, US media company Paramount Global agreed to pay $16 million (13.5 million pounds) to settle a separate legal dispute with Trump involving an interview broadcast on CBS with former vice-president Kamala Harris.","US President Donald Trump says he will sue the BBC for $1bn to $5bn.

First arrests made in spate of attacks targeting Indians in Ireland,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/first-arrests-made-in-spate-of-attacks-targeting-indians-in-ireland/articleshow/125337458.cms,"Representative image





LONDON: The Indian community in Ireland is relieved as finally the first arrests have taken place following a spate of racist attacks targeting them over the summer.On Friday morning the Gardaí (Ireland’s national police force) announced they had arrested a male in his 30s and a male juvenile teen for the brutal attack on the Indian Amazon employee in Tallaght, Dublin, on July 19, which was the first attack to hit the headlines in India.“Both males are currently detained under Section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984 at Garda stations in South Dublin. Investigations are ongoing,” the Garda told TOI.A highly-skilled Indian national, aged in his 40s, was stripped naked, stabbed and left almost for dead by a gang near a roundabout in Kilnamanagh, Tallaght. He had only arrived in Ireland a week earlier and his 11-month-old baby and wife were still in India.Local resident Jennifer Murray, who found him, said: “They gashed his forehead open, punched him in the head, threw him to the ground, and he was left with massive head injuries. They removed his trousers, underwear, phone, bank card, shoes, everything. They very easily could have killed him.”This was followed by numerous other attacks targeting persons of Indian origin in Ireland over the summer. There have been no arrests in any of the other cases.However the attacks, mostly perpetrated by children and teenagers, stopped after schools re-opened in Sept and the nights grew darker.Some Aditya Mandal, an AI professional from West Bengal working in Dublin, said: “The Indian community welcomes this positive development and expresses its sincere gratitude to the Irish govt, An Garda Síochána, and the Indian embassy. We remain confident that justice will be delivered and that the culprits will be held accountable.”“The whole system is very bureaucratic. To make an arrest they need to go through loops of the legal system and that is why the delay. It is not like the UK,” explained Anand Kumar Pandey, a member of the Ireland-India Council. “The Indian community is very happy about the arrests. The process is slow but it seems like all the efforts we made put the pressure on.”","Indian community in Ireland is relieved as finally the first arrests have taken place following a spate of racist attacks targeting them over the summer.

After a year of self-exile, journalist Olivia Nuzzi is back with her bombshell book 'American Canto' due to be released next month, with threadbare details of her affair with 71-year-old RFK Jr, without naming him. Nuzzi was fired from her job at New York Magazine after her secret romance with RFK Jr came to the public and her engagement with journalist Ryan Lizza was also canceled.32-year-old Nuzzi disappeared from the public eye and reportedly spent time in Malibu writing her book. The book reveals that she was in love with Kennedy but only after Kennedy told her 'I love you' first. Kennedy used to calle her 'Livvy' and wrote poems to her; he told her he'd take a bullet for her and also expressed his desire for her to have his child.“She writes that the first few times Kennedy said he loved her, she did not say it back,” the New York Times reported in its article 'Olivia Nuzzi did it all for love'. “Yet she knew she felt the same. ‘I love him, I thought. Oh no. I love him so much.’ They spoke often and were intimate enough for her to see him flossing his teeth, his dopp kit overflowing with prescriptions.”Nuzzi wrote that the mutual infatuation consumed her but it was never consummated, keeping the nature of their relationship ambiguous.Nuzzi revealed that though Trump's health secretary publicly claims to be ""sober"" for decades, he told her that he was taking psychedelics and smoked the powerful drug dimethyltryptamine, or DMT.""She didn’t care that he was 39 years older than her. She liked him just the way he was. They both 'moved through the world with amused detachment and deep sensitivity, contradictions that worked somehow in concert',"" the NYT noted.When the affair became public, Kennedy Jr dismissed it and said he had just met her once for a piece she was writing. Nuzzi wrote in her book that as news broke of their relationship in September 2024, he told her, “If it’s just sex, I can survive it.” She told him she would do whatever he needed her to do.",Olivia Nuzzi was fired from her job at New York Magazine after her secret romance with RFK Jr came to the public.

Just months after its opening, a portion of a highway bridge in China’s Sichuan province collapsed on Tuesday, giving in to a combination of a landslide and apparent structural weakness.The Hongqi bridge in Maerkang, is a 758-metre-long span on a national highway designed to improve travel between Sichuan, China’s central regions, and Tibet, Reuters reported.Footage from the scene shows debris slamming onto the bridge, with part of the span breaking away and falling into the river below. A large plume of dust rose from the collapse site as rubble scattered across the surrounding valley.The bridge was only completed earlier this year, a milestone that the contractor, Sichuan Road & Bridge Group, shared in a video posted on social media.Local authorities confirmed that the incident occurred when landslides struck a mountainside overlooking the structure.However, there were no casualties as the bridge was already closed to traffic before the collapse.Police had shut the structure on Monday afternoon after engineers spotted cracks on slopes and nearby roads, and detected shifts in the mountain terrain above the bridge. Officials in Maerkang said that the closure decision was taken as soon as the cracks and ground movement were detected, and that worsening instability on Tuesday directly led to the collapse, New York Post reported.According to the local government, conditions deteriorated rapidly the following day.On Tuesday afternoon, the weakening mountainside gave way, triggering landslides that destroyed the approach bridge and roadbed.The destroyed bridge section was part of a key highway link intended to ease travel between Sichuan, China’s interior, and the Tibetan Plateau.","A portion of a highway bridge in China's Sichuan province collapsed on Tuesday, giving in to a combination of a landslide and apparent structural weakness.

Nikki Haley Warns Donald Trump of ‘Strategic Disaster’ as 50% US Tariff on India Nears Deadline





Amid the ongoing Christian-Hinduism controversy, Nalin Haley , the son of former US ambassador to UN Nikki Haley, has spoken about his unique journey in finding his faith in a multi-faith family. In an interview with UnHerd, the 24-year-old Indian-origin MAGA voice said he was confused over religion in his childhood. His maternal grandparents who were almost his surrogate parents, followed Sikhism while his parents were Protestant Christians.Haley said he immersed himself in books on world religions to find out what he should follow when other kids of his age were reading about cars and dinosaurs. Eventually, he concluded that Christianity is the true faith but the conclusion was preceded by a spiritual experience that he did not detail in the interview.“I needed to research my own faith better in terms of the history, the early beliefs, the Church Fathers,” he said. “When I did that, I felt as though anyone who does that kind of research will walk away a Catholic.”The interview comes as Hindu Indian-origin politicians in the US are facing unprecedented attacks over their religion. Vice President JD Vance recently said he would like to see his wife Usha Vance converted to Christianity.Though JD clarified that Usha Vance has no intention of converting, the episode showed how MAGA is Christian nationalists at core and unapologetic about it.Haley said he chose his political path too in a similar fashion. I was not just going to have the same political views as my parents,” he said adding that he supported Nikki Haley in the 2024 Republican primary only to be a ""good son"". “I didn’t and was never going to be an advocate for a view that I did not have,"" he said. Like he thinks the US should stop legal immigration as well, though he himself belongs to an immigrant family.","Nalin Haley, the son of former US ambassador to UN Nikki Haley, has spoken about his unique journey in finding his faith in a multi-faith family.

kThe MAGA chief has dragged several other high-profile names into the infamous Epstein scandal, which Democrats have accused him of being a major part of.US President Donald Trump has said he will ask the Department of Justice (DOJ) to investigate big figures linked to pedophile and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein , starting a political fight over newly released emails by Democrats.Trump announced on Friday in a Truth Social post, claiming Democrats were using the “Epstein Hoax” to distract from a government shutdown and other issues. “Now that the Democrats are using the Epstein Hoax, involving Democrats, not Republicans, to try and deflect from their disastrous SHUTDOWN, and all of their other failures, I will be asking A.G. Pam Bondi, and the Department of Justice, together with our great patriots at the FBI, to investigate Jeffrey Epstein’s involvement and relationship with Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, Reid Hoffman, J.P. Morgan, Chase, and many other people and institutions, to determine what was going on with them, and him,” Trump said.He continued, “This is another Russia, Russia, Russia Scam, with all arrows pointing to the Democrats. Records show that these men, and many others, spent large portions of their life with Epstein, and on his ‘Island.’ Stay tuned!!!”The post came days after the House Oversight Committee released a series of emails involving Epstein in which he spoke about Trump.In a 2018 exchange about Michael Cohen’s guilty plea, Epstein said, “I know how dirty donald is.” In another message that year, he wrote, “its wild. because I am the one able to take him down.”Other emails have raised further questions. In an April message sent to author Michael Wolff, Epstein claimed Trump “knew about the girls.” Lawmakers also showed a 2011 email to Ghislaine Maxwell in which Epstein wrote, “I want you to realize that the dog that hasn’t barked is trump.” He added that a person identified by lawmakers as a victim “spent hours at my house with” Trump, saying, “He has never once been mentioned. ”Trump has repeatedly denied knowing about Epstein’s abuse of underage girls and said they fell out in the early 2000s. His new call for investigations also comes as the House prepares for a vote on whether to force the release of long-withheld federal files related to Epstein, which the Justice Department has refused to make public despite earlier assurances from officials, including Attorney General Pam Bondi.","US President Donald Trump has said he will ask the Department of Justice to investigate big figures linked to pedophile and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

US vice president JD Vance is drawing flak after making a joke about former President Joe Biden dying during an interview on Fox News. The moment went viral and triggered Democrats, who called the comment insensitive and irresponsible.The exchange happened during a conversation with host Sean Hannity, who asked Vance whether he feels prepared to take over the presidency if something were to happen to Donald Trump. The question comes at a time when Trump’s own health has been in a questionable state, especially after he underwent a sudden MRI scan last month. It was his second so-called yearly check-up in only six months.Vance brushed aside concerns about 79-year-old Trump’s health and instead took a swipe at 82-year-old Biden. He insisted Trump is “very healthy” and then added, “But if I served under Joe Biden, I’d probably be worried every minute of every day that he was going to croak and that I’d have to become president. Like I’d never be able to sleep. I’d always have my cellphone as loud as possible.” He laughed, and Hannity joined in.Dems said the sly comment crossed a line. They said that joking about a political rival’s death is beneath the office of the vice president.Several Democratic commentators described the moment as “absolutely disgusting,” while others accused Vance of trying to distract from ongoing questions about Trump’s own physical condition.The questions regarding POTUS's health have only intensified in recent weeks. Trump has been seen with bruising on his hand, which he covers with concealer, and with visibly swollen ankles. The White House has said the bruise is the result of frequent handshakes combined with aspirin use. Trump has also appeared tired, dizzy during daytime events, leading some Democrats to suggest he may be experiencing cognitive decline.","JD Vance made the joke during an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity.

An online exchange between ex-DOGE lead Vivek Ramaswamy and Indian-origin MAGA ally Dinesh D’Souza has stirred fresh row inside MAGA circles, exposing simmering tensions over race, education and who counts as an acceptable standard-bearer for the movement, while Donald Trump and his H1-B comments are still in the frayRamaswamy is weighing a run for Ohio governor, and posted a detailed plan, calling for a reset of the education system. “Time to fix K-12 education by bringing literacy & numeracy standards back to public schools… It won’t happen overnight, but this is how we get serious about making America great again. Ohio is ready to lead the way,” he posted on X.D’Souza jumped in with a comment that mocked white culture and claimed that it would be ironic if or when Ramaswamy will raise the ""prospect of white kids"" with education: “How ironic it will be if a brown American like Vivek actually helps to fix education and raise the prospects of white kids, while all the professional whiteys on X continue their idle boasting about how they too could get us to the moon, ‘just like some white dudes did in 1969. ’”The remark fed into an ongoing conversation about whether MAGA is willing to embrace a non-white candidate in a leadership role, especially one who does not fit the traditional mould of a “white American male” conservative. Ramaswamy even drew flak last month for celebrating Halloween with some far-right Republicans calling for his deportation,At the same time, the wider debate over America’s education system is colliding with Donald Trump’s recent shift on the immigration issue.Earlier this week, Trump showed a softer line on H-1B visas, saying the United States “doesn’t have certain talents” and must bring in specialised workers to stay competitive. The admission angered some of his loyalists, who accused him of contradicting the movement’s long-standing rhetoric on 'American First. 'Furthermore, Ramaswamy faced fire last year for earlier comments in which he criticised American culture and accused it of celebrating “mediocrity."" He also said this ""culture"" was one of the main reasons the US administration hires foreigners for high-end tech companies.In a December 2024 post, he said: “The reason top tech companies often hire foreign-born & first-generation engineers over ‘native’ Americans isn’t because of an innate American IQ deficit (a lazy & wrong explanation). A key part of it comes down to the c-word: culture. Tough questions demand tough answers & if we’re really serious about fixing the problem, we have to confront the TRUTH: Our American culture has venerated mediocrity over excellence for way too long (at least since the 90s and likely longer).

Military reforms: Asim Munir at the helm



Judicial restructuring: Federal constitutional court



Political reactions



What next







Pakistan’s National Assembly on Wednesday passed the 27th constitutional amendment bill, granting sweeping powers to the military in general and country’s army chief Asim Munir in specific, and restructuring the judiciary.The vote, held amid a ruckus in the lower house, saw 234 lawmakers in favour and only four against, speaker Ayaz Sadiq announced. The session was attended by top political leaders, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, PML-N President Nawaz Sharif, and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari.The amendment comes at a time of heightened political tension in Pakistan, with the ruling coalition seeking to consolidate control over key defence and judicial institutions. The legislation follows earlier Senate approval, where it received 64 votes in favour and no opposition, as the opposition benches boycotted proceedings.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hailed the passage as a demonstration of national unity, saying the house exhibited solidarity. He also condemned a recent terrorist incident in Wana, drawing parallels to the Army Public School massacre, and praised law enforcement for securing the safety of students and cadets.The amendment elevates Pakistan army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir to the newly created role of Chief of Defence Forces, giving him constitutional authority over all three branches: army, navy, and air force. Honorary five-star ranks such as field marshal, marshal of the air force, and admiral of the fleet remain lifetime titles. According to the country's law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, the reform “aims to bring constitutional oversight to defence appointments while preserving military honour and tradition.The bill also establishes a federal constitutional court (FCC) to handle constitutional and provincial matters, leaving the Supreme Court to focus on civil and criminal cases. The FCC will have equal representation from all provinces and the power to take suo motu notices on constitutional petitions. The Judicial Commission will oversee judge transfers; refusal of a transfer will be treated as retirement.The ruling coalition, including PML-N, PPP, MQM-P, and allies, backed the amendment. Opposition lawmakers condemned it as unconstitutional. PTI chairman Gohar Ali Khan called it the “Baku Amendments” and accused the government of undermining democracy. Mehmood Khan Achakzai of PkMAP protested by tearing a copy of the bill in the house.The amendment now returns to the Senate for final approval before becoming law. Analysts say the 27th amendment significantly strengthens Munir’s role in Pakistan’s military hierarchy while altering judicial oversight, marking a shift in Pakistan’s institutional framework.(With input from agencies, Dawn)","The amendment elevates Pakistan army chief Asim Munir to the newly created role of Chief of Defence Forces.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment

Why it matters

The big picture

The Field Marshal’s expanding power evokes a hybrid of Pakistan’s two most dominant military rulers:

Ayub Khan, who introduced centralized presidential control and laid the foundations for military-led governance.

Zia-ul-Haq, who used the Army and Islamization to seize power, marginalize the judiciary, and suppress civilian opposition.

Munir is consolidating power not through martial law, but via constitutional amendments passed by a pliant parliament.

If Zia’s coup was loud and brutal against a strong popular leadership, Munir’s is silent, yet possibly more far reaching, being done through a political front office that’s pliant and dependent on the Army for authority. With Imran Khan in prison, any opposition will come from the streets and the troubled insurgencies to the west of Islamabad.

Pranab Dhal Samanta in the Economic Times

Zoom in

The transformation follows the India-Pakistan conflict in May 2025, a four-day exchange of air and missile strikes after the Pahalgam terror attack.

India’s Operation Sindoor targeted Pakistani airbases, radars, and command centers.

Pakistan requested a ceasefire after intense damage - a request reportedly initiated by Pakistan’s DGMO.

Donald Trump, who claimed to have brokered the truce(India has repeatedly denied the US President's claims), was effusively thanked by Munir and PM Shehbaz Sharif. Trump now calls Munir his “favorite field marshal.”

The Financial Times described their dynamic as a “bromance,” with Trump showcased on billboards across Pakistan alongside Munir and Sharif.

This international validation was followed by Munir’s promotion to Field Marshal, the second such promotion in Pakistan’s history - and the first codified under the Constitution.

Between the lines

This isn’t just about military command - it’s about rewriting the DNA of the Pakistani state.

The amendment creates a new Federal Constitutional Court, potentially diluting the powers of the Supreme Court and creating ambiguity about the hierarchy of judicial authority.

President Zardari is also granted lifelong immunity in the amendment, mirroring the legal shield given to Munir.

This dual protection signals a strategic alliance between the military and top civilian figures to institutionalize mutual insulation from accountability.

“Too much has been left to ad hoc and arbitrary decisions,” Mazari warned.

The domestic question: Can repression deliver reform?

The three-front storm: Taliban, TTP, and India

“If you nurture snakes in your backyard, they will bite you,” said Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the Pakistani military’s official spokesman, referencing the Taliban. What a comeuppance : The remark could just as well apply to all Pakistan-grown terror groups and the TTP, whose resurgence is a grim case of blowback.

The bottom line





In Pakistan, where generals have often ruled with impunity and influence, Field Marshal Asim Munir is scripting a new playbook-quiet, precise, and constitutionally sealed. His rise is not just another chapter in the country’s well-worn saga of military dominance. It is, as one senior opposition leader put it, “a rewrite of the entire power manual.”Pakistan’s controversial 27th Constitutional Amendment proposes to recast the country’s military command structure by abolishing the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) and creating the role of Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) - a position that will be held by the Army Chief, currently Field Marshal Asim Munir •The amendment vests unprecedented legal and constitutional power in the CDF, giving Munir operational and institutional control over the army, navy, and air force, as well as the country’s nuclear command.•It also grants five-star officers life-long rank, privileges, and immunity, a move seen as creating a parallel unelected authority beyond the reach of civilian or judicial oversight.“This amendment appears tailored to benefit a specific individual rather than to strengthen the defence structure,” Lt Gen Asif Yasin Malik, former defence secretary, told Dawn.The CJCSC post - created after the 1971 war to ensure coordination among services - will be dissolved on November 27, 2025, when the current chairman, Gen Sahir Shamshad Mirza, retires.The 27th Amendment represents the largest shift in Pakistan’s civil-military balance since the Zia era, codifying the military’s supremacy in a way that future civilian governments may struggle to reverse.•The military will no longer merely influence governance from behind the scenes - it will be constitutionally entrenched at the center of executive authority.•Strategic nuclear assets, previously overseen by the National Command Authority, will now fall under the commander of national strategic command, appointed by the PM on the army chief’s advice, and selected from within the army.“All nuclear weapons and delivery systems will be under army control, including second-strike missiles traditionally under the Navy,” warned Dr Shireen Mazari, former human rights minister, a Dawn report said.•The change grants the army a monopoly over promotions, transfers, and postings across the services, threatening morale and inter-service harmony.“If promotions in the Air Force and Navy are determined by an army-origin CDF, it could lead to festering resentments,” Mazari cautioned.At home, Munir is both omnipresent and embattled. According to a Financial Times report, his supporters compare him to Mohammed bin Salman or South Korea’s General Park - ruthless modernisers willing to bulldoze institutions in the name of reform. His critics, however, see echoes of Zia-ul-Haq’s theocratic militarism cloaked in constitutional legitimacy.The judiciary is already split, thanks to a proposed constitutional court that would dilute the Supreme Court’s power. Journalists are censored, civil rights groups are muzzled, and political opponents - most notably former Prime Minister Imran Khan - are jailed or silenced.And yet, Munir has cast himself as the architect of reform. In his speech at the Pakistan Military Academy, he spoke of “treasures hidden beneath our land” and claimed that Pakistan had begun to “regain its rightful place in the comity of nations.”But the economy tells another story. As per the FT report, Pakistan’s investment rate is the lowest in South Asia, its poverty rate has risen to 25%, and its youth unemployment is dangerously high. The country remains dependent on IMF bailouts and Gulf financing that has yet to materialise in promised volumes.While Munir consolidates power at home, Pakistan finds itself encircled by a resurgent triangle of threats - each historically rooted, each dangerously revived. In the west, the Afghan Taliban’s return to power in 2021 has proved more liability than leverage. Once covertly supported by Pakistan’s security establishment, the Taliban now resist Islamabad’s demands and turn a blind eye to cross-border attacks on Pakistani soil.More ominously, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), an offshoot long declared outlawed, has regrouped in Afghanistan and resumed attacks in Pakistan’s tribal belt and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. This year alone, militant violence has killed over 1,400 people - the highest toll in a decade.“The military simply lacks political support on the ground there,” Iftikhar Firdous, founder of The Khorasan Diary, told FT. “The crackdown has alienated entire communities.”Simultaneously, Pakistan’s eastern border with India remains fragile after the four-day air conflict in May.Add to that domestic insurgencies in Balochistan and the Pashtun belt, and Pakistan now faces not one, but three overlapping security fronts. Instead of acting as a force-multiplier, the military’s expanding political and economic footprint is beginning to stretch its operational capacity thin.The 27th Amendment enshrines military supremacy in Pakistan's Constitution under the guise of reform and modernization.•It moves the country further away from parliamentary democracy, and deeper into military-led constitutional authoritarianism.•As Field Marshal Asim Munir prepares to become the first Chief of Defence Forces, Pakistan’s most consequential question remains: Can a military man fix a failing nation - or will history repeat itself?(With inputs from agencies)","Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment.

ISLAMABAD: A suicide bomber killed 12 people outside a court in Islamabad on Tuesday in a sharp escalation of militant violence that the defence minister said had pushed the country into a ""state of war"".Pakistani govt ministers accused neighbouring Afghanistan of complicity in the bloodshed - an accusation Kabul denied - and vowed retaliation if Afghan authorities failed to rein in the militants Islamabad says were responsible. ""We are in a state of war,"" said defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif after the attack, the first strike on civilians in Islamabad in a decade. ""Bringing this war to Islamabad is a message from Kabul, to which Pakistan has the full power to respond.The bombing outside an Islamabad court also wounded 27 people interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said. The court bomber blew himself up near the entrance at around lunchtime. Images on local media showed people covered in blood lying next to a police van. A vehicle was seen on fire and another car was badly damaged. Police cordoned off the site. Naqvi said the bomber had tried to enter the court building on foot but, unable to find a way in, detonated the device outside, close to a police vehicle.Several of the wounded were in critical condition, a hospital source said.No group claimed responsibility for Tuesday's attack. The main Pakistani militant group, Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), denied involvement in the attacks. But a group affiliated with the Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, according to The Khorasan Diary, a digital platform in Islamabad that monitors militant activity in the region.TTP militants have in recent years focused attacks on security forces. Civilians had not been hit in Islamabad for a decade, according to Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, a group that tracks attacks.Islamabad says that the Pakistani Taliban and other militants are based in Afghanistan, with the support of India. ""We are totally clear that Afghanistan has to stop them. In case of a failure, we have no option but to take care of those terrorists who are attacking our country,"" Naqvi said, speaking at the scene of the court bombing. The Taliban administration spokesperson in Kabul did not respond to a request for comment on Pakistan's accusations.The court attack happened hours after militants stormed a school near the Afghan border on Monday. The attack on the school in Wana, in the north west, began Monday, when a suicide vehicle rammed the main entrance, killing three people, Naqvi said. Militants then entered the school, which is run by the military but educates civilians.By Tuesday evening, three militants were still inside the compound, security officials said, with rescue operations under way for the students trapped in another part of the school. Naqvi said that the school assailants were in contact with their handlers in Afghanistan during the attack.Reuters","The bombing outside an Islamabad court also wounded 27 people.

Surge in militant violence and worsening ties with Afghanistan







Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif said the country was “in a state of war” after a suicide bomber struck outside the Islamabad district courts on Tuesday, killing at least 12 people and injuring 27.The blast one of the deadliest to hit the capital in recent years has intensified tensions with Afghanistan, with Asif accusing the Taliban government in Kabul of allowing militants to operate freely.In a post on X, Asif said: “Anyone who thinks that the Pakistan army is fighting this war in the Afghan-Pakistan border region and the remote areas of Balochistan should take today’s suicide attack at the Islamabad district courts as a wake-up call: This is a war for all of Pakistan.”He wrote that Pakistan’s military was making “daily sacrifices while providing citizens with a sense of protection and security”, but warned that hoping for negotiations with Kabul would be a “mistake”. Asif insisted that Afghanistan “has the ability to prevent terrorist attacks inside Pakistan” and that bringing the conflict to the capital was “a message from Kabul”.He added that Pakistan “has the strength to respond fully”, saying the attack had erased any remaining doubts about the threat posed by militants operating from Afghan soil.The explosion took place around midday in Islamabad’s G-11 district, just outside the judicial complex where hundreds of lawyers and visitors were present. Police said the attacker tried to enter the court premises but failed, eventually detonating explosives next to a police vehicle, igniting cars and sending a fireball through the street.Interior minister Mohsin Naqvi confirmed that 12 people were killed and 27 wounded. He said authorities had recovered a severed head believed to be that of the attacker, and CCTV footage captured him moments before the blast. Witnesses described scenes of chaos, with people screaming for help as ambulances rushed to the site.The blast comes amid a sharp rise in militant violence across Pakistan. Security officials say the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has carried out hundreds of attacks this year, mostly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa near the Afghan border, but strikes in major cities have been rare. Islamabad was last hit by a suicide attack three years ago.On Monday night, militants also attempted to storm an army-run college in Wana, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Security forces killed two attackers quickly, while others were cornered inside an administrative building. Students and staff were evacuated, and the military said the assault resembled the TTP’s 2014 massacre in Peshawar that killed 154 people.Pakistan says the Afghan Taliban have allowed TTP fighters to take refuge across the border. Afghanistan denies harbouring the group. Peace talks between Islamabad and Kabul have stalled, with Pakistan demanding written guarantees that Afghan territory will not be used for attacks.",Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif says country is in a state of war.

Islamabad Court SHAKES After Suicide Car Explosion; Attack Day After Blast In India’s Capital





At least 12 people were killed and around 30 others injured after a car exploded near the district and sessions court near G-11 area in Islamabad on Tuesday, local media reported reported. Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif and President Asif Ali Zardari both termed the incident a “suicide blast,” and described the situation as ""Pakistan at war.""Confirming the casualties, the country's interior minister said that those injured were receiving medical care, adding that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was personally monitoring the situation and staying in contact with the hospitals treating the victims.The Pakistan Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, saying in a statement they had targeted judicial officials.""Our fighter attacked the judical commission in Islamabad. Judges, lawyers and officials who carried out rulings under Pakistan's un-Islamic laws were targeted,"" the group said in a statement, threatening to carry out more attacks ""until Islamic Sharia law is implemented"" in the Muslim-majority country, reported AFP.Police said the vehicle caught fire following the blast and was quickly engulfed in flames. The site was subsequently sealed off by authorities who launched a probe to determine the cause of the blast.A heavy contingent of police and security forces rushed to the scene, while rescue teams shifted the injured to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS). Hospital sources said several victims were in critical condition, warning that the death toll could rise.Authorities cordoned off the area and launched an investigation. According to sources, body parts believed to be of the suspected suicide bomber - including a head - were recovered from the site.Naqvi further said, “The attacker stood outside the court for around 12 minutes. He first attempted to go inside the court, but then targeted the police vehicle after he was unable to do so.""He added that an investigation was underway and identifying the attacker was a top priority. “I assure you we will identify him in the next few hours,” he said. “We are investigating this incident from different angles. It is not just another bombing. It happened right in Islamabad,” the minister added.He assured, that things would become clearer in the coming days, adding that those involved would not be spared.Inspector general of Islamabad police Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi and the chief commissioner visited the scene and were briefed on the incident and the ongoing probe. Police said nearby vehicles and motorcycles were also damaged by the explosion and ensuing fire. No group has claimed responsibility so far.In a post on X, Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari expressed his condolences to the bereaved families.Country's defense minister termed the incident as a 'wake-up call' for Pakistan, “We are in a state of war. Anyone who thinks that the Pakistan Army is fighting this war in the Afghan-Pakistan border region and the remote areas of Balochistan, today’s suicide attack at the Islamabad district courts is a wake-up call,” he said.“In this environment, it would be futile to hold out greater hope for successful negotiations with the rulers of Kabul,” he added.The blast comes a day after a separate explosion at the Supreme Court cafeteria, reportedly caused by a gas leak in the air-conditioning system, killed a 19-year-old youth and injured 13 others.No official attribution or claim of responsibility has been announced so far.The back-to-back incidents have heightened concern over safety standards and security preparedness in the Pakistani capital.","At least 12 people killed and around 30 others injured after a car exploded near the district and sessions court in Islamabad.

Deadlock Deepens: Afghanistan Calls Pakistan Irresponsible As Peace Talks Break Down Once Again





ISLAMABAD: Pakistan said on Sunday that it was committed to dialogue to resolve differences with the Afghan Taliban but demanded that Kabul must address concerns regarding the use of its territory by terrorists.Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Tahir Andrabi issued a statement on different media queries regarding the third round of talks with the Afghan Taliban regime in Istanbul on November 6, which concluded a day later. Turkiye and Qatar mediated the parleys.The peace talks ended without any agreement to tackle the thorny issues of cross-border terrorism , the top officials had said on Saturday.""Pakistan remains committed to the resolution of bilateral differences through dialogue. However, Pakistan's core concern, i.e. terrorism emanating from Afghanistan, needs to be addressed first and foremost,"" the FO said in a statement.It also said that Pakistan's Armed Forces and its people were well determined to eliminate the menace of terrorism from its soil and take action against its supporters, abettors and financiers.In the long statement, the spokesperson said that for the past four years, since the Taliban regime came to power in Afghanistan, there has been a sharp surge in terrorist attacks emanating from Afghan soil.""Throughout these years, Pakistan, despite suffering military and civilian casualties, exercised maximum restraint and did not retaliate,"" it said.Pakistan's expectation was that the Taliban regime would be able to control these attacks and take concrete actions against the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan/Fitna al Khawarij (TTP/FaK) elements present on Afghan soil, the FO said.The Pakistan government last year notified the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) as ""Fitna al-Khawarij"", a reference to a group in earlier Islamic history which was involved in violence.Pakistan also tried to positively engage with Afghanistan by offering bilateral trade concessions and humanitarian assistance, and the intention to constructively engage with Afghanistan so as to enable it to become a stable, peaceful and prosperous country that is at peace within and with its neighbours, the statement said.However, despite all these positive gestures, ""the response from the Taliban regime has only been hollow promises and inaction,"" it added.Instead of acting upon the core expectation to stop Afghan territory from being used for attacks against Pakistan, the Taliban regime has always tried to shy away from taking concrete and verifiable actions, it said.""Instead, it has tried to confuse the main issue with other relatively irrelevant and hypothetical issues. By confusing the main issue of terrorism, it keeps trying to develop a narrative which absolves the Taliban regime of its commitments and responsibilities towards the international community and its own people,"" it added.The statement said that Pakistan's October 2025 response to the consistent attacks emanating from Afghanistan was a manifestation of the will and determination that it will not leave any stone unturned to safeguard its territory and its people.The statement added that the Taliban regime was only interested in prolonging the temporary ceasefire, but without taking concrete and verifiable actions against the TTP/FaK terrorists.Pakistan also accused the Afghan Taliban of using the issue of Pakistani terrorists hiding in Afghanistan as a humanitarian issue, adding that they had fled in 2015 to avoid a military operation and fought together with the Afghan Taliban against Nato troops.""These terrorists and their families are now being harboured by the Taliban regime as a payback for their allegiance to the Afghan Taliban,"" it said, and added that the same terrorists established training camps in Afghanistan to launch terrorist activities in Pakistan.The FO rejected the Kabul excuse of lack of control over TTP and demanded definite and concrete actions. Pakistan also rejected the portrayal of TTP as refugees and asked Kabul to hand them over to Pakistan.It said Pakistan has never eschewed dialogue with any Government in Kabul, but it would not hold dialogue with any terrorist group.",Pakistan says it is committed to dialogue to resolve differences with the Afghan Taliban.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment

What does it mean?



Opposition backlash and protests



Divided legal opinions



Support for reforms







Pakistan’s government has introduced a major constitutional change that has sparked widespread debate and protests across the country. The proposed 27th constitutional amendment, which will be voted on in Parliament next week, seeks to restructure the military’s chain of command and overhaul the judiciary, prompting strong criticism from the Opposition.The current move mirrors the era of General Zia-ul-Haq, Pakistan’s longest-serving de facto head of state, who introduced sweeping constitutional changes to entrench military control under a civilian façade. The proposed 27th Amendment, risks reviving that legacy by placing the armed forces once again at the centre of Pakistan’s political structure.The bill, tabled in the Senate on Saturday after cabinet approval, proposes to abolish the post of chairman joint chiefs of staff committee (CJCSC) and replace it with a new and more powerful position -- chief of defence forces (CDF).According to reports in Dawn, the post will be held by the serving chief of army staff, who will also become the constitutional head of the army, navy and air force. This change would make General Asim Munir the most powerful military officer in Pakistan’s history, formalising his recent promotion to Field Marshal.The amendment also includes plans to set up a new federal constitutional court (FCC) and change how high court judges are appointed.It seeks to transfer some powers from the Supreme Court to the new court, while also granting the president lifelong immunity from criminal prosecution.Pakistan law minister Azam Nazir Tarar presented the bill in the senate, where chairman Yusuf Raza Gilani referred it to a committee led by Farooq Naek for review. Naek said the goal was to “create consensus among members” before the bill comes up for voting on Monday. The government is confident of securing a two-thirds majority in both the senate and the national assembly.Opposition parties have strongly opposed the amendment, calling it a direct threat to Pakistan’s Constitution. A coalition of opposition groups, the Tehreek-e-Tahafuz Ayeen-e-Pakistan (TTAP), which includes Imran Khan’s PTI, Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen (MWM), Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) and the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) has announced nationwide protests starting Sunday.“Democratic institutions have been paralysed within Pakistan… the nation must step up against the [proposed] 27th Amendment,” MWM chief Allama Raja Nasir Abbas said.PkMAP leader Mahmood Khan Achakzai said the protests would begin with the slogan: “Long live democracy, down with dictatorship.” He warned, “The opposition alliance had no choice but to launch a protest movement following the government’s move, which is shaking the foundations of the Constitution.”Legal experts are split on the amendment’s impact. Critics say it would reduce the powers of the Supreme Court, making it “irrelevant,” and tighten executive control over the judiciary.One senior counsel told Dawn, “Left with a limited jurisdiction of deciding ordinary civil, criminal and statutory appeals, the Supreme Court has now become all the more a ‘Supreme District Court’.”Former additional attorney general Tariq Mehmood Khokhar warned that the changes would “empower [the new] Federal Constitutional Court by disempowering the Supreme Court.” He said the amendment also gives the Chief of the Defence Forces constitutional authority for life, formally recognising the Field Marshal rank.Another lawyer pointed out that under the new Article 175A, the chief justice of the FCC would outrank the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan and serve until the age of 68 -- three years longer than the current limit of 65.Some legal experts, however, have welcomed the changes. Senior counsel Hafiz Ahsaan Ahmad Khokhar called the 27th Amendment “a major and long-awaited structural shift” in Pakistan’s justice system.He said the plan to have two separate apex courts -- one for appeals (Supreme Court) and one for constitutional cases (FCC) -- would bring “greater clarity, efficiency and constitutional coherence.”He also argued that the reforms could reduce political influence in the judiciary, cut down case backlogs, and modernise the justice system.Khokhar added that the new defence structure under Article 243 was in line with “modern constitutional democracies,” ensuring that the armed forces would operate under a single advisory framework accountable to the prime minister, defence minister and National Security Committee.Newly elected Supreme Court Bar Association in Pakistan, President Haroonur Rasheed also supported the creation of a Federal Constitutional Court, saying it could help streamline the judicial process.","Proposed 27th constitutional amendment will be voted on in Parliament next week.

Pakistan on edge: Jaffar Express services suspended over security fears; thousands affected,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-on-edge-jaffar-express-services-suspended-over-security-fears-thousands-affected/articleshow/125199650.cms,"Over the past 12 months, the Jaffar Express has become a repeated target for insurgent groups (AI image)

Blast Hits Jaffar Express in Pakistan, Several Injured

A train under siege



The months that followed saw a stream of attacks:

In October, a blast on the Sindh section of the railway line derailed five bogies and injured several passengers.

In September, an explosion on the track in Mastung derailed six coaches, leaving 12 injured.

In August, six coaches derailed after an improvised explosive device went off in Mastung, while days earlier a pilot engine came under gunfire.

In July and June, two separate blasts in Sindh derailed multiple coaches.

Late last year, a suicide bomber at Quetta Station killed at least 26 people.

One battle after another

Pakistan Railways has halted all operations of the Jaffar Express between Quetta and Peshawar for four days beginning Sunday, citing “serious security concerns” in Balochistan, news agency PTI reported.The temporary suspension — enforced from 9 to 12 November — follows multiple insurgent attacks on the train over the past year, including a dramatic hijacking in March that left 26 people dead.Railway officials said the move came after fresh intelligence warnings of possible attacks targeting tracks, railway assets and civilian passengers. “The precautionary measure is based on advice from security and intelligence agencies to ensure the safety of passengers, railway staff, civilians and critical rail assets,” a senior official said, as quoted by PTI.The Jaffar Express is one of Pakistan’s busiest long-distance routes, carrying thousands of passengers daily at a cost far lower than road travel. Local commuters have criticised the shutdown, saying it leaves people in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with few affordable transport options.Over the past 12 months, the Jaffar Express has become a repeated target for insurgent groups, particularly the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA).In March, BLA militants hijacked the train with 380 passengers on board, triggering a two-day standoff in a mountainous tunnel. Twenty-six people were killed before security forces rescued more than 350 passengers. Authorities said 33 militants also died in the rescue operation.Security officials say insurgent groups are increasingly targeting railways to cripple movement and signal the state’s inability to secure critical transport arteries. Analysts note that the frequency of attacks shows “a collapse of basic security control” across parts of Balochistan’s rail corridor.Political leaders in the province argue that Islamabad has ignored decades of local grievances. Balochistan National Party chief Akhtar Mengal recently warned that the state has “lost control” of the region, saying: “There is not a single inch of Balochistan left where the government can claim authority.”The suspension comes as Pakistan faces one of its most dangerous security challenges in years. Not only has the BLA intensified operations across Balochistan, but attacks linked to Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Islamic State Khorasan (ISK) and cross-border militants have surged.According to the latest Global Terrorism Index, Pakistan recorded a 45% jump in terrorism-related deaths this year. Security officials warn the country is now battling “four fronts at once”—an insurgent network straddling provincial, sectarian and cross-border lines.Diplomatic efforts have yielded little. Peace talks this week between Pakistan and Afghanistan in Istanbul collapsed without agreement, with both sides blaming each other for breakdowns in the ceasefire. Pakistan accuses Kabul of sheltering TTP fighters; the Taliban dismisses the allegations.","Pakistan Railways has halted all operations of the Jaffar Express between Quetta and Peshawar for four days beginning Sunday.

Pakistan’s government has moved ahead with one of the most sweeping structural changes to the country’s constitutional and military setup in decades. The proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment, tabled in the Senate on Saturday after approval by the federal cabinet, rewrites the chain of command of the armed forces and places Field Marshall Asim Munir higher than any military officer before him.The bill restructures Article 243 of the Constitution and creates a powerful new post: Chief of Defence Forces (CDF). According to Dawn, the position will be held by the serving Chief of Army Staff, who will simultaneously become the constitutionally recognised head of Pakistan’s Army, Navy and Air Force. The development formalises General Munir’s elevation as Pakistan’s Field Marshal — a title that the government has already awarded but is now seeking to permanently embed into the Constitution.The changes have ignited intense debate in Islamabad, dividing political parties, lawyers and civil society. Supporters argue that the bill modernises command structures, while critics see it as a dramatic centralisation of military power that weakens civilian oversight.As per report from Dawn, the bill abolishes the position of Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), the top coordinating office among Pakistan’s military services, from 27 November, when the tenure of the current CJCSC General Sahir Shamshad Mirza ends.Law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar told Parliament that no new appointment will be made, because the Army Chief will take over the role’s functions as Chief of Defence Forces.Under the amendment, the President will appoint the Army, Naval and Air Chiefs on the Prime Minister’s advice, while the CDF will be constitutionally empowered to command all three services.A new position Commander of the National Strategic Command will oversee Pakistan’s nuclear and strategic arsenal. Dawn reported that the commander must be an officer from the Army, appointed by the Prime Minister on the recommendation of the CDF. This further cements the Army Chief’s control over nuclear command authority.The bill also grants unprecedented rights to officers who attain five-star ranks such as Field Marshal, Marshal of the Air Force, or Admiral of the Fleet.Law minister Tarar clarified that Parliament not the Pakistan Prime Minister will have the power to cancel such titles.The amendment does not stop at the military. The second half of the proposal restructures Pakistan’s judicial system.According to Geo News, the bill establishes a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC): a powerful new judicial body that would:Legal experts quoted by Dawn warned that the changes could “dethrone” the Supreme Court as Pakistan’s top judicial authority. One senior counsel said the Supreme Court risked being turned into a “Supreme District Court”, dealing mostly with ordinary appeals, while constitutional matters shift to the FCC.Former additional attorney general Tariq Mehmood Khokhar argued that the amendment tightens executive control over the judiciary and “empowers the FCC by disempowering the Supreme Court”.However, other senior lawyers called it a “forward-looking reform”. They say separating constitutional and appellate functions would reduce delays, depoliticise the Supreme Court and bring Pakistan closer to judicial models in other democracies.The bill has triggered fierce debate in Islamabad. The timing — months after Munir’s elevation and amid delicate coalition negotiations — has intensified public scrutiny.Dawn reported that the proposal surfaced after PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari revealed that PML-N leaders, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, requested PPP support for constitutional reforms.Government allies insist the reform merely formalises existing military structures and honours national heroes. Critics say it permanently rebalances power in favour of the Army.If adopted, the 27th Constitutional Amendment will be one of Pakistan’s most consequential defence reforms since the 1980s, dissolving one of the military’s oldest offices, raising the Army Chief to unprecedented constitutional supremacy, and reshaping Pakistan’s highest courts.","Pakistan's government has moved ahead with one of the most sweeping structural changes to the country’s constitutional and military setup in decades.

Donald Trump Stuns Shehbaz Sharif With India-Pak Peace Remark After Gaza Ceasefire Summit In Egypt





ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday once again thanked US President Donald Trump for resolving the India-Pakistan conflict in May.New Delhi has been consistently maintaining that India and Pakistan reached an understanding on May 10 to end the conflict after four days of intense cross-border drone and missile strikes, and no third party was involved in the process.""It was President Trump's bold and decisive leadership that brought about the ceasefire between Pakistan and India, restoring peace in South Asia, averting a major war, and saving millions of people,"" Sharif said while addressing Azerbaijan's Victory Day parade in Baku.Since May 10, when Trump announced on social media that India and Pakistan had agreed to a ""full and immediate ceasefire"" after a ""long night"" of talks mediated by Washington, he has repeated his claim several times that he ""helped settle"" the tensions between the two countries.India has consistently denied any third-party intervention.Pakistan has praised Trump on multiple occasions, claiming that he brokered a ceasefire during the May conflict.India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in retaliation for the April 22 Pahalgam attack that killed 26 civilians.In his address, Sharif also mentioned Kashmir, saying that Azerbaijan's victory in Karabakh is a beacon of hope for all nations fighting against oppression.The Prime Minister said Pakistan seeks peace, but it will not allow anyone to challenge its sovereignty or undermine territorial integrity.The parade also included contingents of the armed forces from Pakistan and Turkiye who marched alongside Azerbaijani forces. The ceremony also included a splendid flypast of JF-17 Thunder jets.","Pakistan has praised Trump on multiple occasions, claiming that he brokered a ceasefire during the May conflict.

Deadlock Deepens: Afghanistan Calls Pakistan Irresponsible As Peace Talks Break Down Once Again

(With ANI inputs)





NEW DELHI: A day after peace talks between Afghanistan and Pakistan in Turkey broke down, the Taliban on Saturday accused “elements within the Pakistani military” of pursuing “anti-Afghanistan policies for years. ”“Unfortunately, certain military elements in Pakistan appear to view a stable and strong Afghanistan as contrary to their interests,” Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement on X. “They have long exploited Afghanistan’s instability, conflicts, and displacement, and now seem intent on creating tensions through fabricated pretexts.”Mujahid also rejected claims that the rise of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) was linked to the Taliban’s return to power in Kabul. “Some groups have falsely accused the Islamic Emirate, suggesting that instability in Pakistan and the TTP’s growth began with our arrival. In reality, both date back to 2002, a result of misguided policies by certain Pakistani military elements who aligned with the US, permitted drone strikes in Waziristan, and turned against their own people,” he wrote.He pointed to a series of Pakistani military campaigns against the TTP — including Operations Al-Mizan, Rah-e-Rast, Sher Dil, Nijat, Koh-e-Safid, and Zarb-e-Azb — that, he said, displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians.“In this so-called war on terror, 80,000–90,000 soldiers and civilians were killed, by Islamabad’s own count, long before the Islamic Emirate’s rise,” Mujahid added.Calling Pakistan’s instability “an internal issue,” Mujahid remarked the Taliban has taken steps to prevent cross-border militancy since taking power. These include mediating dialogue among political and religious figures, relocating refugees from the Durand Line, banning weapons among refugee populations, and issuing fatwas against unauthorized foreign jihad.“The Islamic Emirate welcomes all efforts that allow refugees to return safely,” he stated, reaffirming that Afghanistan would not allow its territory to be used to interfere in another country’s affairs.","The Taliban accused “elements within the Pakistani military’ of pursuing “anti- Afghanistan policies for years” “They have long exploited Afghanistan’s instability, conflicts, and displacement, and now seem intent on creating tensions through fabricated pretexts,” Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125186693,imgsize-78016,width-400,resizemode-4/taliban-accuses-pakistani-military-of-fueling-instability-through-quotmanufactured-pretextsquot.jpg"

CIA Whistleblower Confirms Pakistan’s F-16s Were Nuke-Capable, But US Hid The Truth From The World

‘Benazir was cut out of the loop’

A cover-up?





In a startling revelation, former CIA counterproliferation officer Richard Barlow has claimed that successive US Presidents continued to certify Pakistan as a non-nuclear state until 1989 — even though Washington’s own intelligence showed that US-supplied F-16 fighter jets had been modified to deliver nuclear weapons.Barlow, who tracked Pakistan’s clandestine nuclear program through the 1980s, said US officials were fully aware of Islamabad’s nuclear capabilities. “We knew that the F-16s were capable of delivering the Pakistani nuclear weapons as they existed at that time, without any doubt. It’s a hard engineering question, period. It had been looked at by the engineers and the physicists, not by me. There was that. Yet the government went ahead with the sale,” Barlow said in an interview with ANI.He added that the Reagan and Bush administrations kept certifying that Pakistan did not possess nuclear weapons “all the way through 1989,” even as CIA assessments contradicted those claims. “The President continued to certify that Pakistan did not possess nuclear weapons all the way through 1989. Now, I mean, I can tell you that most of us in the CIA are not comfortable with that, to say the least. But we’re not elected officials,” Barlow said.“All we can do is provide the elected officials and senior policymakers with the best available intelligence information, which is accurate, and brief them accordingly. What they do after that is not our place; we’re not in control of that.”Barlow said the US intelligence community had long concluded that Pakistan’s F-16 fleet could deliver nuclear weapons, a finding later echoed in journalist Seymour Hersh’s 1993 article in The New Yorker. “You can read all about it in Seymour Hersh’s article in The New Yorker in 1993. They saw the intelligence community saw nuclear weapons moving to air bases and being put on F-16s, et cetera. You know, so the nuclear weapons that Pakistan did not possess, according to the President of the United States, were actually being stuck on,” Barlow said.The revelations trace back to the 1987 “Brass Tacks” crisis, when Pakistani scientist Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan openly hinted at a nuclear deterrent amid heightened tensions with India. Barlow noted that the US technical experts had already verified Pakistan’s nuclear capability at that time.“To put it in a nutshell, there had been studies for years inside the intelligence community by experts, like national laboratories, etc. We knew all about the Pakistani nuclear weapons design, and we knew all about the F-16s, as you could imagine,” he said.According to Barlow, then Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto had limited control over Pakistan’s nuclear program, which was effectively managed by General Mirza Aslam Beg and President Ghulam Ishaq Khan. The US, he said, only confronted Islamabad over the issue after the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989.The US had kept the matter quiet during the Afghan war to secure Pakistan’s cooperation against the Soviet Union — a Cold War priority that overshadowed nuclear proliferation concerns.Additionally, talking about past India-Pakistan tensions, Barlow said that by 1990, tensions between India and Pakistan over the nuclear issue had reached alarming levels. The crisis was ultimately defused after then Defense Secretary Robert Gates was sent to New Delhi and Islamabad by President George HW Bush.He added that the 1990 standoff was “far more dangerous” than more recent India-Pakistan flare-ups due to poor command structures and limited communication. “There was a significantly greater chance of miscalculation in 1990 and miscommunication, among other issues. So I think that was a far more dangerous period,” he said.Barlow also discussed the Pressler Amendment, a 1985 US law requiring the President to certify annually that Pakistan did not possess a nuclear device to receive military aid.“After the 1990 nuclear crisis, my bosses at the agency refused to go along with any more certifications. Believe it or not, there were still people in the US government who wanted to certify under the Pressler Amendment,” he said. “They were having a collective heart attack because they knew it was over — the aid, et cetera.”Barlow also claimed that senior US State Department officials secretly tipped off Islamabad about an undercover American operation in the 1980s to arrest a retired Pakistani general involved in nuclear smuggling. The joint CIA–Customs sting had targeted Pakistani agent Arshad Parvez, who was attempting to purchase 25 metric tons of Maraging 350 steel — a key material for uranium enrichment — under the direction of Brigadier General Inam-ul-Haq. “He was supposed to show up in Pennsylvania... but Haq didn’t show up. And I learned that some people in the State Department had tipped off the Pakistani government to this arrest warrantBarlow said he was furious upon learning that officials within his own government had sabotaged the operation, describing his reaction as “ballistic.” The revelation, he said, pointed to how elements within Washington prioritized Pakistan’s cooperation in the Afghan war over enforcing non-proliferation laws. “These were people in my own government, the enemy within,” Barlow remarked, adding that such internal compromises weakened US efforts to curb Pakistan’s nuclear build-up during the 1980s.",Former CIA counterproliferation officer Richard Barlow has claimed that successive US Presidents continued to certify Pakistan as a non-nuclear state until 1989. Barlow said Washington’s own intelligence showed that US-supplied F-16 fighter jets had been modified to deliver nuclear weapons.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125181296,imgsize-750328,width-400,resizemode-4/article-81.jpg"
