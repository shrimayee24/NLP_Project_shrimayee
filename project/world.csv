SC: Negligence of even 0.001% in NEET must be examined,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-negligence-of-even-0-001-in-neet-must-be-examined/articleshow/111094613.cms,"New Delhi: Observing that even 0.001% negligence in conducting NEET-UG must be examined thoroughly, Supreme Court on Tuesday said Centre and National Testing Agency ( NTA ) should admit if there had been any mistake in organising the test and rectify it, instead of denying it.As allegations of mismanagement and question paper leak marred the medical entrance examination taken by over 24 lakh candidates and against which students in different parts of the country are holding protests, a bench of Justices Vikram Nath and SVN Bhatti expressed concern over students indulging in illegal and corrupt means to get admission in MBBS courses and said this was ""deleterious to society"".The bench said timely action should be taken by authorities in such cases as children put a lot of hard work for the exam and their interests should be protected. ""Even if there is 0.001% negligence on the part of anyone, it should be thoroughly dealt with. All these matters ought not to be treated as adversarial litigation,"" the bench said.""You must stand firm. If there is a mistake then admit there is a mistake and say this is the action we will take. At least that inspires confidence in your performance. One can easily find out what has gone wrong,"" it added.Advocate Kanu Aggarwal, appearing for the Centre, said the govt was alive to the problem and that was why the decision to award grace marks to 1,563 students was withdrawn and a retest was ordered. He further said the Centre was not taking the litigation initiated by students as adversarial but cautioned against drawing any conclusion until the govt and the NTA had filed their response.Appearing for a group of 32 medical aspirants from different parts of the country who took the test on May 5, advocate Kunal Cheema urged the bench to seek a status report from Bihar police which is investigating the paper leak case. He said the report would be very helpful in deciding the case.However, the bench said all aspects of the case would be heard along with a batch of other petitions on July 8, including on seeking a status report. The court issued fresh notices to Centre and NTA asking them to file their response within two weeks.Praying for re-examination, the petition additionally said to the court, ""The petitioners and their family members have put in years of preparation for the examination, with the hopes that they would get into a good govt college on a free seat. However, the question paper leak as reported in the media and upon perusal of the contents of the press release, it has become amply clear that the question paper leak has spread its tentacles all over the country and has resulted in grave injustice being caused to the petitioners.""Earlier, Centre and NTA admitted before the SC that it was a mistake to award grace marks to students. They reversed the decision and decided to conduct a fresh test for 1,563 students. NTA had awarded them compensatory marks.The aggrieved students did not get the full 3 hours and 20 minutes time and NTA had awarded them compensatory marks based on the recommendations of the grievance redressal committee.",Justices Vikram Nath and SVN Bhatti expressed concern over students indulging in illegal and corrupt means to get admission in MBBS courses. The bench said timely action should be taken by authorities as children put a lot of hard work for the exam and their interests should be protected.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111094626,imgsize-2088031,width-400,resizemode-4/111094626.jpg"

Armed forces formulate new doctrine for cyberspace operations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/armed-forces-formulate-new-doctrine-for-cyberspace-operations/articleshow/111094158.cms,"NEW DELHI: The armed forces have formulated a new joint doctrine for cyberspace operations , which have become critical in modern-day warfare, especially in the backdrop of China developing potent cyber-warfare and cyber-espionage capabilities.The doctrine, which was released by chief of defence staff General Anil Chauhan in the presence of the three Service chiefs on Tuesday, is a ""keystone publication"" that will guide commanders in planning and conducting cyberspace operations in the current complex military operating environment, an officer said.China has built major capabilities in the cyberwarfare domain, including cyberweapons to degrade or destroy an adversary's military assets and strategic networks as well as energy, banking, transport and communication grids even before the actual kinetic war kicks off, as reported by TOI earlier.India has been lagging far behind in this arena, with the govt in 2019 only approving the creation of only a small tri-service Defence Cyber Agency instead of the full-fledged Cyber Command that the armed forces wanted.The officer said the new joint doctrine is ""a significant step"" to give impetus to the ongoing process of integration being actively pursued by the Army, IAF and Navy.""In addition to the traditional domains of land, sea and air, cyberspace has emerged as a crucial and challenging domain in modern warfare. Hostile actions in cyberspace can impact the nation's economy, cohesion, political decision-making, and the country's ability to defend itself,"" he said. ""Operations in cyberspace need to be dovetailed into the national security fabric, to evolve the 'Ends,' 'Ways' and 'Means' to create advantage and influence events in all other operational environments and across all instruments of power,"" he further added.The doctrine comes at a time when the Army is operationalising dedicated specialised units in each of its six operational or regional commands to handle the cyberspace domain.The Army says these Command Cyber Operations and Support Wings will help to safeguard its networks and increase the preparedness levels in this dimension of warfare. ""It will lead to overall strengthening of the Army's cyber-security posture for both conventional operations as well as grey zone warfare,"" an officer said.","The doctrine is a ""keystone publication"" that will guide commanders in planning and conducting cyberspace operations.

Officials said automatic signalling is installed on double or multiple line sections having high traffic density to be able to carry more trains with minimum detention.Signal failure occurred between Rangapani and Chetterhat stations at 5.50 am on Monday and this was communicated to the signal department.

Ecuador stops waiving visas for Chinese nationals over rise in irregular migration,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/ecuador-stops-waiving-visas-for-chinese-nationals-over-rise-in-irregular-migration/articleshow/111094634.cms,"Ecuador 's foreign ministry on Tuesday said that it was effectively reinstating a visa requirement for travellers from China, citing an increase in irregular migratory flows from the Asian nation.

The ministry, in a statement posted on social media, said that it was suspending an agreement with China which had waived the requirement for travelers to obtain a visa. It added that many Chinese travellers had overstayed the permitted 90-day period, with some potentially using Ecuador as a stepping stone to reach other destinations in the region. The ministry also said that in recent months, nearly half of visitors from the country did not exit through regular routes on time.

Asked about Ecuador's visa waiver suspension, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said Tuesday that China firmly opposes all forms of human smuggling . ""The agreement on mutual visa exemption between China and Ecuador... has played an important and positive role in promoting cross-border travel and practical cooperation in various fields between the two nations.""

Since 2022, Ecuador has seen an increase in the number of Chinese citizens entering its territory without registering their departure. Between 2023 and 2024, 66,189 Chinese travellers entered the country, while just 34,209 were recorded as leaving, meaning some 32,000 have not been registered as leaving Ecuador, the foreign ministry said. Many of the Chinese citizens arriving in Ecuador head toward the US, mainly through the so-called Darien Gap , the ministry added.

However, the administration has gone to lengths to avoid any suggestion that Israeli forces have crossed a red line in the deepening Rafah invasion, which would trigger a more sweeping ban on arms transfers.Netanyahu, in a short video, spoke directly to the camera in English as he lobbed sharp criticisms at Biden over ""bottlenecks"" in arms transfers. ""It's inconceivable that in the past few months, the administration has been withholding weapons and ammunitions to Israel,"" Netanyahu said, adding, ""Give us the tools and we'll finish the job a lot faster.""Netanyahu didn't elaborate on what weapons were being held back, and the Israeli military declined to respond to a request for comment.

Putin vows to support North Korea against the United States,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/putin-vows-to-support-north-korea-against-the-united-states/articleshow/111094571.cms,"SEOUL/MOSCOW - Russian President Vladimir Putin vowed on Tuesday to deepen trade and security ties with North Korea and to support it against the United States, as he headed to the reclusive nuclear-armed country for the first time in 24 years.The US and its Asian allies are trying to work out just how far Russia will go in support of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, whose country is the only one to have conducted nuclear weapon tests in the 21st century.In a signal that Russia, a veto-wielding member of the United Nations Security Council, is reassessing its entire approach to North Korea, Putin praised Pyongyang for resisting what he said was US economic pressure, blackmail and threats.In an article published by North Korean state media, Putin praised ""Comrade"" Kim, and promised to ""jointly resist illegitimate unilateral restrictions"", to develop trade and strengthen security across Eurasia.""Washington, refusing to implement previously reached agreements, continuously puts forward new, increasingly stringent and obviously unacceptable demands,"" Putin said in the article, printed on the front page of North Korea's Rodong Sinmun, the ruling Workers' Party mouthpiece.""Russia has always supported and will continue to support the DPRK and the heroic Korean people in their opposition to the insidious, dangerous and aggressive enemy.""Putin noted the Soviet Union was the first to recognise the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) founded by Kim's grandfather, Kim Il Sung, less than two years before the 1950 Korean War.North Korean state media also published articles praising Russia and supporting its military operations in Ukraine , calling them a ""sacred war of all Russian citizens"".Putin's state visit comes amid US accusations that North Korea has supplied ""dozens of ballistic missiles and over 11,000 containers of munitions to Russia"" for use in Ukraine. South Korea, a staunch US ally, has raised similar concerns.The White House said on Monday it was troubled by the deepening relationship between Russia and North Korea. The US State Department said it was ""quite certain"" Putin would be seeking arms to support his war in Ukraine.Moscow and Pyongyang have denied arms transfers but have vowed to boost military ties, possibly including joint drills.Russia is due to outproduce the whole NATO military alliance on ammunition production this year, so Putin's trip is likely aimed at underscoring to Washington just how disruptive Moscow can be on a host of global crises.Russia in March vetoed the annual renewal of a panel of experts monitoring enforcement of longstanding United Nations sanctions against North Korea over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes.PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENTPutin's foreign policy adviser, Yuri Ushakov, said Russia and North Korea may sign a partnership agreement during the visit that would include security issues.He said the deal would not be directed against any other country, but would ""outline prospects for further cooperation"".The visit will include one-on-one discussions between the two leaders, as well as a gala concert, state reception, honour guards, document signings, and a statement to the media, Russia's Interfax news agency quoted Ushakov as saying.Russian Defence Minister Andrei Belousov, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, the ministers for natural resources, health, and transport, the heads of the Russian space agency and its railways, and Putin's point man for energy, Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak, will be part of the delegation.Ahead of the visit, North Korea appears to have been making preparations for a possible military parade in downtown Pyongyang, commercial satellite imagery showed.The summit presents the greatest threat to US national security since the Korean War, said Victor Cha, a former US national security official now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies.""This relationship, deep in history and reinvigorated by the war in Ukraine, undermines the security of Europe, Asia, and the US homeland,"" he wrote in a report on Monday.He urged Washington to work with Europe and other partners to increase economic and diplomatic pressure on Pyongyang, engage with China, and launch a major human rights and information campaign to flood the North with outside media.North Korea has been under UN sanctions for its ballistic missile and nuclear programs since 2006, and those measures have been strengthened over the years.The Security Council has been divided over how to deal with Pyongyang.Russia and China say more sanctions will not help and that joint military drills by the United States and South Korea merely provoke Pyongyang. Two years ago, they vetoed a US-led push to impose more UN sanctions on North Korea over its renewed ballistic missile launches.Washington and its Asian allies accuse Beijing and Moscow of emboldening North Korea by shielding it from more sanctions.After North Korea, Putin will visit Vietnam on June 19-20.(Reporting by Hyonhee Shin and Josh Smith and Guy Faulconbridge in Moscow; Additional reporting by Lidia Kelly in Melbourne and Michelle Nichols in New York; Editing by Gerry Doyle and Gareth Jones)","Russian President Vladimir Putin vows to deepen trade and security ties with North Korea.

Thailand passes same-sex marriage bill,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/thailand-passes-same-sex-marriage-bill/articleshow/111094523.cms,"Lawmakers in Thailand voted on Tuesday to approve a marriage equality bill , a move that puts the country on a clear path to becoming the first in Southeast Asia to legalise same-sex marriage . Thailand's Senate passed the bill by 130 votes to 4, with some abstentions, on Tuesday afternoon. It was approved by the House of Representatives in March. The legislation would become law after it is reviewed by a Senate committee and the Constitutional Court and receives royal assent from the king, a formality that is widely expected to be granted.""After 20 years of trying to legalise this matter,"" activist Plaifa Kyoka Shodladd said in the Senate chamber after the vote, ""finally, love wins."" The bill's passage underscores Thailand's status as a relative haven for gay couples in Asia. Only Taiwan and Nepal have legalised same-sex marriage.In some Asian countries, gay sex is a criminal offense. Indonesia, where gay marriage is illegal, made extramarital sex illegal in 2022. In 2019, Brunei made gay sex punishable with death by stoning. It later said it would not carry out executions, after widespread international protest.After the bill's passage, hundreds of supporters gathered in downtown Bangkok to celebrate the milestone despite the punishing heat, waving flags and throwing colorful balloons at a Pride rally. A parade began with the bang of a firecracker and confetti flying in the air. Gloria Gaynor's ""I Will Survive"" played at the rally, as well as a '90s-style Thai pop song called ""History"", with the lyrics: ""History won't repeat anymore, history's about to change its course, change toward equality."" PM Srettha Thavisin said he would host a celebration for activists on Tuesday, though he said he could not attend the event because of a Covid infection.Thailand's bill, which amends the country's civil and commercial code, calls marriage a partnership between two people age 18 and above, without specifying gender. It also gives LGBTQ couples equal rights to adopt children, claim tax allowances, inherit property and give consent for medical treatment when their partners are incapacitated.The bill has been contentious since its first version was introduced over 20 years ago. While Thailand is one of the most open places in the world for gay couples, it is socially conservative in other ways. In Feb, lawmakers dismissed a proposal to let people change genders on official documents. But a majority of the Thai public supports the marriage equality bill.

"Biden's new policy to offer deportation protection, work permits for spouses of US citizens",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/bidens-new-policy-to-offer-deportation-protection-work-permits-for-spouses-of-us-citizens/articleshow/111072930.cms,"US President Joe Biden is set to announce a comprehensive new policy on Tuesday that aims to protect hundreds of thousands of individuals married to US citizens from deportation. This move, highly anticipated by many Democrats, emerges as a significant election-year decision on immigration.On the agenda for a White House event , US President plans to introduce this initiative while also celebrating the Obama-era program known as the ""dreamers"" directive. This directive has historically provided deportation protections for young undocumented immigrants.According to sources familiar with the matter, the new policy will offer approximately 490,000 spouses of US citizens the chance to apply for a ""parole in place"" program. If they have resided in the country for at least 10 years, this program would not only shield them from deportation but also grant them work permits. These sources requested anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss the announcement publicly.The White House opted not to comment on the announcement when reached on Monday.This announcement represents a pivotal moment for Biden's administration. At the beginning of his presidency, Biden pledged to advocate for broader relief for the millions of immigrants in the US without permanent legal status. However, as migrant numbers hit record highs and Biden gears up for a potential re-election contest against Donald Trump , recent policy changes have reflected a stricter stance. Earlier this month, Biden's administration implemented a border crackdown that many critics feel mirrors those of Trump's era.The recent restrictive measures at the US-Mexico border, effectively halting asylum processing, have drawn criticism from Biden’s political allies.Representative Nanette Barragan, D-Calif., who heads the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, expressed her support for upcoming announcements, predicting they would bring ""tears of joy paired with some sighs of relief"" for many families.Some families affected by Biden's new policy are expected to attend the White House event on Tuesday afternoon.For a while, administration officials have explored various ways to protect immigrants without legal status but with deep-rooted ties in the US The authority Biden is leveraging will not only offer deportation protections and work permits but will also remove legal barriers, allowing eligible immigrants to apply for permanent residency and, eventually, US citizenship. This authority has previously been applied to other groups, including US military members and their families without legal status.""Today, I have spoken about what we need to do to secure the border,” Biden said at a June 4 White House event when introducing his order to suspend asylum processing for many migrants. “In the weeks ahead - and I mean the weeks ahead - I will speak to how we can make our immigration system more fair and more just.""Biden is also expected to extend eligibility for visas to recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, moving beyond the temporary work authorizations currently granted to them.Immigration advocates welcomed the expected policy for spouses of US citizens, noting the challenges these individuals face in obtaining legal status despite having substantial ties in the country.""This is a defining moment in history, and we need to meet this moment,"" said Ashley DeAzevedo, president of American Families United, an advocacy group for US citizens married to foreign nationals.Despite the positive reception from advocates, Biden’s use of this authority could face legal challenges, similar to the challenges faced by the DACA program. The White House plans to commemorate the 12th anniversary of the DACA program, initiated by then-President Barack Obama to protect young immigrants, often referred to as ""dreamers.""In recent weeks, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus has urged Biden to shield the spouses of US citizens from deportation and to create work visas for graduates of US colleges who came to the country without authorization as children.Several House Democrats plan to return to Washington for the announcement, which is expected to be warmly received within their ranks.Senator Alex Padilla, D-Calif., described Biden's action as ""justice"" that ""was long overdue for the people who have been waiting but are key to so many thriving families and communities.""Advocates believe the policy could be politically advantageous for Biden.""We anticipate that immigrant and Latino voters will express their gratitude at the ballot box in November,"" said Gustavo Torres, president of CASA in Action.Donald Trump, on the other hand, has pledged to deport millions of migrants if he is re-elected. His campaign’s rhetoric continues to be strongly anti-immigration.While Biden's policy targets longtime US residents, it has drawn criticism from Republicans. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, characterized it as a ""huge magnet"" for potential immigrants, suggesting it would ""attract even more people"" to the border.(With inputs from agencies)","US President Joe Biden is set to announce a comprehensive new policy on Tuesday.

Explained: Why Russian President Vladimir Putin is visiting North Korea,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/vladimir-putin-to-visit-kim-jong-un-russia-north-korea-relations-ukraine-war-putin-kim-bromance/articleshow/111073224.cms,"Putin and Kim bromance has blossomed after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Why it matters

The Economist has termed the growing Russia-North Korea ties as ""Vladimir Putin’s dangerous bromance with Kim Jong Un"". As per the Economist, the Putin-Kim bromance has blossomed thanks to geopolitical shifts.

has blossomed thanks to geopolitical shifts. Kim turned away from talks with America following the failed summit in Hanoi and began making fresh overtures to Russia. The response was lukewarm—until Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine floundered and Russia came to need munitions, one of the few things Kim’s regime has in abundance.

However, this realignment extends beyond mere arms deals, as North Korea helps Russia complicate American strategy in Asia and undermine multilateral institutions.

What they are saying

Jenny Town of the Stimson Centre, an American think-tank, told the Economist: “It’s a mistake to think about it simply as an arms deal.”

“It is the biggest strategic opportunity for North Korea since the end of the Cold War,” said Ankit Panda of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

“The new Russian love with North Korea is shallow and artificial,” argued Andrei Lankov, a Russian expert on North Korea based at Kookmin University in Seoul.

Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba characterized the trip as a ""lonely bromance"" between Putin and Kim.

How has this partnership affected international dynamics?

North Korea’s alliance with Russia complicates American strategy in Asia and undermines multilateral institutions. Russia’s veto of a United Nations resolution extending the mandate of the Panel of Experts on North Korean sanctions in March highlighted this cooperation. This relationship also deters South Korea from providing direct lethal aid to Ukraine. Fyodor Tertitskiy of Kookmin University noted, “It’s not a bilateral relationship—big brother is always watching from Beijing.”

What has North Korea gained from this partnership?

North Korea has benefitted from trade with Russia, which has helped stabilize its economy amidst years of sanctions and the Covid-19 pandemic. Summits with Putin have bolstered Kim’s image domestically. Ankit Panda of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace highlighted, “It is the biggest strategic opportunity for North Korea since the end of the Cold War.”

What might Russia offer North Korea in return?

Speculation surrounds what Russia might provide in return for North Korean arms. South Korea’s government believes North Korea’s wish list includes nuclear weapons designs, re-entry vehicles for intercontinental ballistic missiles, and technology related to satellites, submarines, and hypersonic weapons. Putin has already given Kim a Russian-made luxury limousine, but sensitive military technology transfers have yet to occur.

What are the long-term prospects of this relationship?

The partnership is likely to last as long as the war in Ukraine continues, but it may not endure beyond it. Lee Sang-hyun of the Sejong Institute remarked, “The calculated convergence of national interests can shift if the circumstances change.” Russia’s need for North Korean munitions may diminish as its own arms production ramps up.

What are the concerns of the United States and its allies?

Washington is troubled by the deepening relationship between Russia and North Korea. US state department spokesperson Matthew Miller said, “North Korea has supplied dozens of ballistic missiles and over 11,000 containers of munitions to Russia.”

There are concerns about what Russia might provide North Korea in return, whether it be hard currency, energy, or military technology. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell emphasized the need for vigilance, saying, “We don’t know. But we’re concerned by that and watching carefully.”

How does China fit into this relationship?

China’s role in the Russia-North Korea relationship is significant. Beijing’s influence can shape the depth of cooperation between Russia and North Korea. Fyodor Tertitskiy pointed out, “Big brother is always watching from Beijing.” While China supports North Korea as a stable buffer state, closer military ties between Russia and North Korea could threaten these aims.

Vladimir Putin , the President of Russia, is visiting North Korea this week for the first time in 24 years, marking a significant deepening of relations between Moscow and Pyongyang. This visit underscores the burgeoning partnership between the two nuclear-armed states, particularly in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un , who has referred to their relationship as an “unbreakable relationship of comrades-in-arms,” extended the invitation during his visit to Russia’s Far East last September.Here is all you need to know about growing Russia-North Korea ties:(With inputs from agencies)",Putin and Kim bromance has blossomed after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Legal age for marriage in Pakistan

The marriage of a 12-year-old girl to a 72-year-old man named Habib Khan was called off after successful intervention by the police in Pakistan's Charsadda town. While the police managed to arrest the groom and the 'Nikah Khwan' (a person who solemnizes the marriage), the girl's father managed to escape.A case has been registered against the girl's father, the 72-year-old man, and the 'Nikkah Khwan' under the Child Marriage Act , according to ARY News. Despite the existence of laws prohibiting child marriage, such incidents continue to occur in various parts of Pakistan. The minor girl was sent to a hospital for a medical examination.The girl's father, Alam Syed, had reportedly agreed to sell his daughter to the elderly man for PKR 500,000.In recent times, law enforcement agencies have thwarted similar attempts in Rajanpur and Thatta, where young girls were being coerced into marrying older men. In Rajanpur, Punjab, an 11-year-old girl was set to marry a 40-year-old man, while in Thatta, a young girl was forcibly married to a 50-year-old landlord before the police took action and rescued the girl.In another incident on May 6, a 70-year-old man was arrested by the police for marrying a 13-year-old girl in Swat. The girl's father had arranged the marriage, but the police swiftly took the groom and the father into custody. The 'Nikkah Khwan' and the marriage witnesses were also arrested, and the minor girl was sent to a hospital for a medical examination.In Pakistan, the legal age for marriage differs based on gender. While the internationally recognized minimum age for both males and females is 18, the country's laws allow males to marry at 18 but permit females to wed at the younger age of 16.Although Sindh province took a step towards gender equality in 2013 by passing legislation to raise the minimum age of marriage to 18 for both genders, this progressive change has not been adopted and implemented throughout the nation. The disparity in legal marriage age between men and women persists in other parts of the nation.","The marriage of a 12-year-old girl to a 72- year-old man was called off after successful intervention by the police in Pakistan's Charsadda town.

Will Biden's new immigration policy help Indian-Americans? Here's what we know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/will-bidens-new-immigration-policy-help-indian-americans-heres-what-we-know/articleshow/111092811.cms,"Biden's new immigration policy: Who benefits

Why do the spouses of American citizens need protection?

When will the program take effect?

President Joe Biden has announced a new immigration policy in which spouses of American citizens will obtain legal status if they are illegal immigrants. The policy will be applicable to those who have been residing in the country for not less than 10 years and are married to a US citizen before June 17, 2024. According to the White House, the move will benefit at least 500,000 people in addition to some 50,000 stepchildren of US citizens.Indian-Americans are a major group who will be safeguarded from deportation fears in the new policy. Undocumented Indians are to benefit from the policy as their numbers have been steadily growing since 2011. Those who will qualify under this policy will get work authorization followed by their right to stay in the United States for up to three years. By the time, they can apply for the green card -- if married to a US citizen.Marrying an American citizen generally provides a pathway to US citizenship. But people who crossed the southern border illegally must return to their home countries to complete the process for a green card, something that can take years. The new program allows families to remain in the country while they pursue legal status.Biden administration officials said they expected the program to start by the end of the summer. Those eligible will then be able to apply for the benefits.New York Times noted that Biden is trying to strike a tricky balance on immigration, which is a serious political vulnerability for him. Polls show Americans want tougher policies. Just two weeks ago, Biden announced a crackdown on asylum at the southern border. His new policy, giving hundreds of thousands of immigrants new legal protections, is a way for him to answer the calls from the progressive base of the Democratic Party, which has accused the White House of betraying campaign promises to enact a more humane approach to immigrants.","President Joe Biden announced a new immigration policy in which spouses of American citizens will obtain legal status if they are illegal immigrants.

Legal blow for Donald Trump as court rejects appeal of gag order in hush money case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/legal-blow-for-donald-trump-as-court-rejects-appeal-of-gag-order-in-hush-money-case/articleshow/111092453.cms,"New York's top court on Tuesday refused to hear former US President Donald Trump 's appeal regarding the gag order in his hush money case , maintaining the restrictions following his felony conviction in May. The Court of Appeals found that the order does not present ""substantial"" constitutional issues warranting immediate intervention.This decision marks another legal setback for the former Republican president, who has repeatedly criticized the gag order, which prohibits him from commenting on witnesses, jurors, and others involved in the case. However, the trial judge , Juan M Merchan, is expected to make a ruling soon on a defense request to lift the gag order.Trump's attorneys filed a notice of appeal with the state's high court on May 15, during his historic criminal trial. They contended that the gag order limited Trump's ""core political speech on matters of central importance at the height of his Presidential campaign.""The Court of Appeals, however, did not agree. In a decision list released on Tuesday, the court stated that it would not automatically hear the case, noting that ""no substantial constitutional question is directly involved.""Trump's lawyers were essentially attempting to expedite their appeal through a shortcut, which was denied by the state's mid-level appeals court last month. They now have 30 days to file a motion for leave to appeal, according to court spokesperson Gary Spencer.Merchan imposed the gag order on March 26, a few weeks before the trial began, after prosecutors expressed concerns about the presumptive Republican presidential nominee's propensity to attack individuals involved in his cases.During the trial, Merchan held Trump in contempt of court and fined him $10,000 for violating the gag order. The judge warned that Trump could face jail time if he repeated the violation.The order remains in effect weeks after the trial concluded, which resulted in Trump's conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records. Prosecutors alleged that this was an attempt to conceal a hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels just before the 2016 election. Daniels claims she had a sexual encounter with Trump a decade earlier, which he denies. Trump is scheduled to be sentenced on July 11.","New York's Court of Appeals refused to hear Donald Trump's appeal regarding the gag order in his hush money case. The former US President was convicted on 34 counts of falsifying business records in May. The gag order prohibits him from commenting on witnesses, jurors, and others involved in the case.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111092501,imgsize-1287842,width-400,resizemode-4/111092501.jpg"
Pakistan: Report highlights alarming trends of religious persecution against Christians,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-report-highlights-alarming-trends-of-religious-persecution-against-christians/articleshow/111082577.cms,"FAISALABAD: Human Rights Focus Pakistan ( HRFP ) has published a detailed fact-finding report uncovering disturbing incidents of religious persecution against Christians , particularly in Sargodha.HRFP is a group that raises the voices of minorities , women, and marginalized communities in Pakistan.This comes in the wake of a mob attack last month, where Nazir Masih's family was attacked on the accusations of blasphemy. The incident unfolded on May 25 in Sargodha's Mujahid Colony, where Nazir and other Christians were accused of blasphemy , sparking violent outrage among locals.After fighting for his life for eight days, Masih succumbed to his injuries on Sunday.The incident showed a troubling pattern in Pakistan where blasphemy accusations lead to violence against Christian communities.HRFP has expressed deep concern over the swift post-arrest bail granted to 52 attackers involved in the Sargodha incident.Despite the First Information Report (FIR) being filed against 44 identified and 400 unidentified suspects under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) 1997 and Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), progress in police investigations and court proceedings has been slow and inadequate.Compounding the community's apprehensions are threatening videos released by Islamic groups following the incident, exacerbating fears among the Christian community.Drawing parallels with the August 16, 2023, attack in Jaranwala, the HRFP report highlighted similar incidents of mob violence and property destruction against minorities. It underscores a recurring pattern involving provocation, and subsequent violence, often followed by the expedient release of perpetrators.HRFP has called for decisive action, citing intelligence reports linking extremist groups to multiple blasphemy allegations. The organization has also urged stringent measures to address these threats.The report also documented individual cases of violence and harassment against Christians across Pakistan.Farooq Masih's family in Jaranwala continues to face threats. Despite the FIR filed in February, the perpetrators are still at large.Similarly, the case of Saima Bibi, who suffered an assault in April, was downplayed as an 'accident' despite clear evidence of the attack.The plight of Rawal Masih, Romeo Masih, Waqas Masih, Rakhsana Bibi, Asifa Bibi, Shazia Zaulfiqar, and Ahsan Masih, who all were abducted and murdered, also underscores the ongoing oppression faced by PakistChristians.Naveed Walter, president of HRFP, emphasized the ""dire circumstances"" for minorities in Pakistan and urged increased protection and support for the Christian community. He called for an end to the misuse of blasphemy accusations and fabricated justifications for violence, stressing the need for systemic reforms to ensure minority safety.The HRFP report underscores the urgent situation faced by Christians in Pakistan and advocates for international and local intervention to uphold human rights and justice.","Human Rights Focus Pakistan (HRFP) has published a detailed fact-finding report uncovering disturbing incidents of religious persecution against Christians.

NEW DELHI: In a heart-wrenching display of their persistent sorrow and discontent, families affected by enforced disappearances in the Balochistan region of Pakistan decided to abandon customary Eid festivities. Instead, they planned to stage a protest to voice their outrage against state agencies alleged to have perpetrated atrocities against the Baloch people.

Mama Qadir Baloch , a key member of the Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP), declared the protest in a video statement, asserting, ""For the past 15 years, the atrocities committed by the Army and intelligence agencies of Pakistan have led the Baloch to boycott Eid celebrations. While Muslims across the world celebrate this occasion, the Baloch mourn.""

Coinciding with this, families of the missing persons organized a sit-in protest at Shaheed Fida Chowk on Eid day, following a similar demonstration in front of the DC office just days prior. The earlier protest concluded after the district administration provided assurances to the families.

The decision to protest on Eid emphasizes the profound impact of enforced disappearances on the Baloch community, who have been tirelessly seeking justice and answers regarding the fate of their loved ones, allegedly taken by state forces.
