Poll Do you think stricter protocols need to be implemented to prevent in-flight emergencies? Yes, stronger measures are necessary No, current systems are adequate





CHENNAI/ BENGALURU: An IndiGo flight from Guwahati to Chennai with 168 passengers on board made an emergency landing at Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) in Bengaluru on Thursday night after the captain gave a ‘Mayday’ (distress) call due to insufficient fuel.The pilot of IndiGo flight 6E-6764 (A321), which took off from Guwahati at 4.40pm, attempted to land at Chennai around 7.45pm, but decided to ‘go around’ after the landing gear touched the runway in a procedure called ‘balked landing’. “About 35 miles from Bengaluru airport, the captain made a ‘Mayday’ call,” said a source familiar with the development.The source said it appeared to be an ‘unstabilised approach’. “The sudden and steep climb had many passengers on the edge of their seats, some visibly frightened,” said a passenger who did not wish to be named.Multiple sources at the airport and ATC confirmed that the pilot did not attempt a second approach, he instead decided to fly to Bengaluru.Sources in KIA said: “After getting the distress call, the ATC alerted the on-ground staff members who swung into action. Medical and fire services personnel were in place. The aircraft landed safely at 8.20pm.”A source said both the pilots have been taken off the roster, but IndiGo refused to confirm the information.The airline said the flight was diverted to Bengaluru because of traffic congestion at Chennai airport – a claim that Chennai ATC disputed.“It appears that the plane, after the ‘go around’, did not have the mandatory minimum diversion fuel’,” said a source. IndiGo refused to confirm if the pilot made the ‘Mayday’ call.After landing at Bengaluru at 8.20pm, the crew announced that the flight would leave for Chennai after refuelling. A different set of pilots flew the plane to Chennai, where it landed at 11.25pm.","The pilot of IndiGo flight 6E-6764 (A321) attempted to land at Chennai around 7.45pm.

The victim, Tannu Kumar from Shikohabad in Firozabad district, Uttar Pradesh , was married to Arun Singh from Roshan Nagar two years ago.The victim's father, Hakim, claimed that despite his suspicions about a freshly covered pit observed during his visit to his brother-in-law's residence, the police initially dismissed his concerns.Four family members have been charged at Palla Police Station: Bhoop Singh (from UP's Mainpuri), his wife Sonia, son Arun Singh, and daughter Kajal.

For the last 2-3 days, the entire Congress party kept saying that Pakistan's army chief general Asim Munir is going to the US.This was a trap by Pakistan,” Dubey told ANI.“People across the country turned the opposition to Modi into opposition to the country. Today, it is known that the White House or the US military never called Asim Munir. What is the difference between the Pakistan Muslim League and Jairam Ramesh?”Taking a deeper historical swipe, Dubey cited the 1985 Kanishka bombing by Khalistani extremists, alleging Canada’s inaction at the time was symptomatic of how Indira Gandhi’s diplomatic efforts were often ignored.“When the Kanishka bomb blast happened in 1985, Canada began its investigation only in 2006. Former Canadian PM Pierre Trudeau, who was in power from 1968 to 1984, received seven letters from Indira Gandhi over 16 years, asking him to act against Khalistani terrorists,” Dubey said.“He never responded.

It must be an embarrassment to any country that the military chief gets invited and the prime minister is nowhere to be seen,” Singh said.“It’s a very strange thing... It’s a weird, structurally imbalanced state where the military essentially has first claim on resources.”His remarks come amid growing global scrutiny of Pakistan's internal power dynamics and its military’s central role in foreign policy.On India’s recently concluded Operation Sindoor , Singh revealed that the Pakistani military faced “manifold” losses in terms of both men and material compared to India.“In terms of both assets, material and casualties, the losses on their side are manifold, anything that we have suffered,” he said.Singh also commented on speculation about Chinese support to Pakistan during the operation. While ruling out direct involvement, he hinted at indirect assistance.“Collusion in terms of equipment, supplies, helping them out in various ways, perhaps with satellite imagery as well — all that could have happened, but definitely they did not take any active role,” Singh said.“Trust is low… Pakistanis don't have many resources, so they will do all this begging, borrowing, etc., to get equipment from wherever they can, whether it is Turkey or China. So we should be aware of that nexus and take appropriate steps.”",India's Defence Secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh expressed surprise over US President Donald Trump's recent lunch meeting with Pakistan Army Chief General Asim Munir.

NEW DELHI: Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi, on Saturday renewed his attack on the Election Commission, questioning its transparency and alleging a deliberate attempt to destroy crucial poll-related data. The poll body reacted saying that making webcasting footage of polling stations public violated privacy and security concerns of voters.""Voter list? Will not provide machine-readable format. CCTV footage? It was hidden by changing the law. Photo-video of the election? Now, not in 1 year, we will destroy it in 45 days only. The one from whom the answer was needed - is destroying the evidence. It is clear - the match is fixed. And a fixed election is poison for democracy,"" read a post by Rahul Gandhi on X.EC officials argued that while such demands appeared to champion voter interest and democratic integrity, they were actually intended to achieve the ""opposite objective"".What is presented as a reasonable and logical request directly contradicts voter privacy, legal provisions under the Representation of the People Acts of 1950 and 1951, and Supreme Court directives, PTI reported citing EC officials.Officials warned that sharing the footage could allow easy identification of voters and non-voters, exposing them to potential pressure, discrimination, or intimidation by anti-social elements. Citing a possible scenario, officials further said that if a political party received fewer votes at a specific booth, it could use CCTV footage to identify who voted and who didn’t—potentially leading to targeted harassment or intimidation of those individuals.They clarified that the Election Commission retained CCTV footage, used solely as an internal administrative tool, for 45 days in line with the legal window for filing an election petition. Since no election can be challenged beyond this period, they argued that keeping the footage any longer could lead to its misuse by non-contestants to spread misinformation or malicious narratives. They added that if an election petition is filed within 45 days, the footage is preserved and made available to the competent court upon request.The government, last year, amended election rules, based on the EC's recommendation, to restrict public access to certain electronic records—such as CCTV and webcast footage—to prevent misuse. In a May 30 letter, the EC informed state officials that multiple recording methods, including photography, videography, CCTV, and webcasting, are used to document the election process.","Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi, renewed his attack on the Election Commission, questioning its transparency.

MUMBAI: A joint team of forest department and BMC officials inspected actor Shah Rukh Khan 's bungalow, Mannat, at Bandra Bandstand, on Friday following a complaint about coastal regulation zone (CRZ) violations during renovation of the property.The property comprises Mannat, a heritage structure, and an annex structure, a multi-storey building. As Khan and his family have shifted to a nearby place due to the renovation, the officials were met by his staff who told them they would submit all documents concerning the permissions obtained.Pooja Dadlani, Khan's manager, said ""There are no complaints. All work is going on as per guidelines.""The property is undergoing renovation, and clearances were earlier sought from the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) for it. The renovation included adding two additional floors to the annexe structure.A forest department official said, ""A team carried out a site inspection as we received a complaint about renovation permissions. A report will be prepared based on findings and submitted soon.""An official, who was part of the team, said the staff present at the site told them they would submit all documents concerning the permissions obtained.The BMC's H-West ward building and factory department and the building proposal department officials were asked to accompany the forest team for carrying out the inspection.

""The name of this building was changed to Mannat later. In 2005, an extension building of seven floors was made behind the heritage bungalow and since at that time Urban Land Ceiling Act was in force, a large apartment could not have been made. To overcome this legal hurdle, approval for 12 small independent flats was taken from the BMC by the owners namely Shah Rukh Khan and Gauri Khan. However, once the approval was obtained, all these 12 small flats, which were essentially meant for mass housing under the Act, were merged and a super luxury accommodation of a single family was constructed,"" said Singh.","A joint team of forest department and BMC officials inspected actor Shah Rukh Khan's bungalow, Mannat, at Bandra Bandstand, on Friday.

One of the Pahalgam attackers was former Pak para commando

NEW DELHI: Three attackers - all Pakistani terrorists affiliated to Lashkar-e-Taiba - executed the brutal killing of 26 men, including 25 tourists, in Pahalgam on April 22, as per disclosures by two Kashmiris arrested by National Investigation Agency Sunday for harbouring the three terrorists prior to the attack.The arrests of Parvaiz Ahmad Jothar from Batkote, Pahalgam, and Bashir Ahmad Jothar of Hill Park, Pahalgam, mark a big breakthrough in the case that shook the nation. The attack, the origins of which were traced to masterminds based in Pakistan, had led to retaliatory strikes by India on terror facilities and later even military assets inside Pakistan.The two arrested men — accused of having knowingly provided shelter to the three attackers at a seasonal ‘dhok’ (hut) in Hill Park, besides food and logistical support, before the terror act — have disclosed the identities of the three armed terrorists involved in the attack, confirming that they were Pakistani nationals affiliated to the proscribed terrorist outfit LeT.TOI has learnt that one of the attackers is confirmed to be Hashim Musa alias Sulaiman, purportedly a former para commando of Pakistan army’s special forces, the Special Service Group (SSG). As reported by TOI on April 29, Musa was active in Kashmir for a few months before the Pahalgam massacre and was part of the twin strikes in Oct 2024 at Gagangir, Ganderbal, in which six non-locals and a local doctor were killed, and Buta Pathri, which had left two Army personnel and two porters dead.Musa was possibly loaned by SSG to the LeT, which had sent him on a specific mission to unleash terror attacks on non-locals and security forces, as per sources.Apart from Musa, J&K police had put out sketches of another Pakistani terrorist, Ali Bhai, and a local terrorist, Adil Hussain Thoker, who had received terror training in Pakistan — all identified on the basis of eyewitness statements. It had declared a Rs 20-lakh award for any information on them.NIA sources told TOI that the agency zeroed in on Parvaiz and Bashir based on statements of witnesses, including around 15 overground workers found to be in touch with the attackers or who had partial knowledge of the conspiracy, as well as “technical analysis”. Technical surveillance found that the attackers were in touch with Pakistan-based Lashkar masterminds via Chinese apps such as Ultra. They are still suspected to be hiding in the jungles dotting the Tral-Kulgam-Anantnag tri-junction.The two arrested accused will be produced in an NIA court in Jammu. Their custodial interrogation is expected to give important clues about the Pahalgam attack conspiracy and its origins in Pakistan.Sources told TOI that the two accused do not have a police record. NIA has arrested the duo under Section 19 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967.",Arrests of two Kashmiris mark a big breakthrough in the case that shook the nation.

'Enemy made big mistake': Iran's Supreme Leader







US President Donald Trump on Sunday said that the recent airstrikes on Iran's nuclear facilities delivered a devastating blow to Tehran’s nuclear programme.In a post on Truth Social, Trump said: ""Monumental Damage was done to all Nuclear sites in Iran, as shown by satellite images. Obliteration is an accurate term! The white structure shown is deeply imbedded into the rock, with even its roof well below ground level, and completely shielded from flame. The biggest damage took place far below ground level. Bullseye!!!""The attack on Iran’s Fordow nuclear site, carried out Saturday evening at 6:40 pm ET, involved dropping a total of 14 Massive Ordnance Penetrators (MOPs), also known as “bunker busters,” from multiple B-2 bomber jets. The mission marked the first time the US has used the massive 15-ton GBU-57 bombs in combat.US President Donald Trump praised the mission in a statement on Truth Social, writing: “There is not another military in the world that could have done this.”Also Read: 'Why wouldn't there be a regime change?': Trump drops a big 'hint' after Operation Midnight Hammer in Iran; contradicts his own administration Satellite images showed serious damage to the Fordow nuclear site in Iran after the airstrikes. The pictures, provided by Planet Labs PBC, showed that parts of the mountain above the site have changed colour and shape.Brown slopes now appear grey and uneven, likely caused by powerful explosions.The site is deeply embedded within a mountain and protected from most types of attacks. However, following the strikes, it appears to have taken direct hits strong enough to seal its entry points. Experts say this kind of damage could make the facility inaccessible without major excavation work.After the strikes, Trump posted on Truth Social: ""We have completed our very successful attack on the three Nuclear sites in Iran, including Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan. All planes are now outside of Iran air space. A full payload of BOMBS was dropped on the primary site, Fordow.""B-2 stealth bomber crews tasked with the daring strike on Iran’s Fordow nuclear enrichment plant completed a gruelling 37-hour round-trip mission from Missouri to Iran and back.The billion-dollar jets have a wingspan of 172 feet and space for two pilots. The bombers are designed to fly undetected through enemy defences, and their stealth technology remains among the most advanced in the world.The jets are even equipped with a toilet, a refrigerator for snacks, and a place for one person to lie down while the other flies the jet.

Flying in silence: How the B-2s reached Iran unnoticed



Massive bunker busters and a submarine barrage



Inside the B-2: Stealth, speed and power



Numbers behind the mission







Under a cloak of secrecy and tonnes of planning, American stealth bombers launched a surprise attack with surgical precision, unleashing a powerful blow on Iran's underground nuclear sites.Operation Midnight Hammer saw seven B-2 Spirit bombers fly nearly 37 hours round-trip from Missouri to Iran, dropping 30,000-pound bunker-buster bombs on three key underground nuclear sites last week.The attack was designed to deal a critical blow to Iran's uranium enrichment programme, in line with US President Donald Trump 's stance that Iran cannot be allowed to possess nuclear weapons.The bombers were supported by dozens of fighter jets, aerial tankers and a submarine, and struck targets at Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan with 75 precision-guided weapons. “We devastated the Iranian nuclear program,"" said US secretary of defence Pete Hegseth , calling it an ""incredible and overwhelming success.""The mission was made possible by a complex deception plan. While seven B-2 bombers flew east from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri to strike Iran, another set of bombers was sent west as decoys, drawing attention from media, government officials and military spotters. Backed by stealth fighters and support aircraft, the real bombers flew across the Atlantic and Mediterranean in near radio silence, refuelling multiple times in mid-air before reaching their targets.US Air Force General Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, explained that the operation was so secretive that “only an extremely small number of planners and key leaders” knew about it in advance. ""Our B-2s went in and out and back without the world knowing at all,"" said Hegseth.As the bombers approached Iran, a US submarine launched more than two dozen Tomahawk cruise missiles toward the Isfahan site, an hour ahead of the B-2s. Fighter jets checked for any threats along the route, but according to Caine, ""Iran's fighters did not fly, and it appears that Iran's surface-to-air missile systems did not see us.""At 6:40 pm ET on Saturday (2:10 am in Iran), the lead B-2 bomber dropped two GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators (MOPs) on the Fordow site. The rest followed over a 25-minute window, releasing 14 bunker busters on Fordow and Natanz, while Tomahawk missiles targeted Isfahan. All three sites are central to Iran’s nuclear fuel processing.Trump said the Fordow facility, Iran’s most heavily protected nuclear site, is now “gone”. In his address from the White House, Trump called the strike “a spectacular military success.” He added, “If peace does not come quickly, we will go after those other targets with precision, speed and skill.""Each B-2 bomber costs about $2.1 billion and has a wingspan of 172 feet. It was designed in the late 1980s, and only 21 were built. The B-2 is one of the world’s most advanced military aircraft, capable of flying over 6,000 nautical miles without refuelling. It can carry over 40,000 pounds of bombs inside its stealth-coated body, including MOPs and other precision-guided weapons.Its two-man crew benefits from high levels of automation and even a few in-flight comforts such as a toilet, refrigerator, microwave and space for one pilot to lie down while the other flies.The 30,000-pound MOPs dropped on Fordow are the largest conventional bombs in the US arsenal, able to penetrate over 200 feet of reinforced concrete. This was their first-ever use in combat.According to Pentagon figures, more than 125 aircraft participated in the mission, including stealth bombers, support planes, fighters and surveillance craft. A total of 75 precision weapons were used, including 14 bunker busters and over two dozen cruise missiles.Initial assessments suggest that the damage to Iran’s nuclear programme is severe. ""Initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction,"" said Caine. Iran denied the extent of the damage and vowed to retaliate.Operation Midnight Hammer has gone down as the largest B-2 operational strike in US history and the longest such mission since 2001.","B-2 bombers dropped 30,000-pound bunker-buster bombs on Iran's nuclear sites.

Move to end dynastic succession?



US, Israel signal Khamenei not untouchable







Staring at an uncertain future, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has reportedly named three senior clerics as potential successors marking an unprecedented move since the Iran-Israel war began, suggesting that he is preparing for the end of his more than three-decade rule.According to a New York Times report, Khamenei’s son Mojtaba, who is also a cleric, has not been named in the list of successors. Iran’s former hardline president, Ebrahim Raisi, was once seen as a leading contender to succeed Ayatollah Khamenei, but his prospects ended with his death in a helicopter crash in 2024.Moreover, the report, citing Iranian officials, said that Khamenei has retreated to a secure underground bunker, suspending all electronic communications and relying solely on a trusted aide to relay messages to military commanders. These emergency protocols reflect a deep concern over assassination threats, particularly following the deaths of several high-ranking IRGC officials in recent Israeli attacks.Long viewed as a shadowy figure with considerable influence behind the scenes, and often speculated to be groomed for leadership, Mojtaba’s omission signals a deliberate move to reject dynastic succession.This may be an attempt to preserve the Islamic Republic’s legitimacy by upholding its religious and institutional foundations rather than allowing power to pass within a family line.By naming successors and reshuffling key positions within the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Khamenei appears to be laying the groundwork for continuity in case of further instability or even his own sudden demise.It is a rare acknowledgment of the fragility now surrounding Iran’s top leadership, as the country grapples with both external military threats and internal questions about its political future.Khamenei's apprehensions aren't delusional. US and Israel have, at several moments in the past week, made it clear that the two would consider targeting the Supreme Leader.Even though the United States has not officially entered the Iran-Israel crisis, Donald Trump has made his contempt towards Khamenei crystal clear after he issued a stark warning to the Supreme Leader saying that the States wouldn't ""kill"" him, ""at least not for now"".""We know exactly where the so-called 'Supreme Leader' is hiding. He is an easy target, but is safe there - We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now,"" he had said earlier this week. Trump has also demanded an unconditional surrender.This was followed by Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu's warning that the nation wasn't ruling out targeting Khamenei. Speaking to ABC news, when asked if Israel would target the Supreme Leader, Netanyahu said ""doing what we need to do.""Meanwhile, Khamenei has not directly responded to these threats, but has made it clear that Iran would not ""submit to anyone's attacks"".","Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has reportedly named three senior clerics as potential successors.

Both accused produced in court





INDORE: In a significant breakthrough in the Raja Raghuvanshi murder case, the Shillong police officials recovered the charred remains of the bag which was brought back to Indore by key accused, Sonam, after the murder.The bag, the officials believed, contained key evidence including mobile phones, Raja's gold jewellery. The police have been on the lookout for the bag.The recovery was made from a vacant plot in Hare Krishna Vihar Colony near MR-3 in Indore. The operation was carried out by Shillong Police in coordination with Indore Crime Branch and forensic experts, who collected the partially burnt electronic components and blackened metallic fragments from the site.These remains, which are linked to the murder, have been sealed and are being sent to the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) for detailed examination, said police.The location of the remains was revealed by accused Silom, property dealer arrested on Saturday, who led the police to the spot where he admitted to burning the bag with the help of the second accused Ballu alias Balvindar, security guard of the building where Sonam had rented the flat.The SIT, has been carrying out intensive searches in the city for the past five days looking specifically for the bag hidden in the flat which was rented by Sonam during her stay in Indore while evading arrest.The Shillong SIT officials had on Saturday late night arrested Silom James, a property dealer from Mahalaxmi Nagar in Indore. Silom had rented the flat to Vishal for Rs 17,000 a month.Sonam shifted into the flat after returning to Indore. After the arrests of other accused in the case from Indore, Sonam left for Ghazipur on June 8, leaving the bag behind. Two days later, Silom allegedly entered the flat using a duplicate key and took away bags, clothes, food items, and other belongings which he claimed he destroyed at the vacant plot.Police sources said that CCTV footage sourced by them shows the accused Silom removing the bag from the flat in his car on June 10.Earlier, Silom had appeared before the media on June 13, claiming he recognized one of the accused, Vishal, after seeing him in TV news and newspaper reports.Meanwhile, the second accused Ballu alias Balvindar, was arrested from Ashoknagar and brought to Indore on Sunday afternoon. Both have been booked for aiding murder accused and tampering with evidence.Additional DCP Rajesh Dandotiya said that both accused were produced before the court and sent on transit remand for seven days till June 28.Krishna Pandey, defence advocate on behalf of Silom James said, ""He was produced before the court and sent on transit remand for seven days. James is just a property dealer and has no direct involvement in the crime. He never spoke to Raj or Sonam and the Shillong police officials have not submitted any audio or video evidence to support this.""On being asked how James showed police where he had burnt the bag, Pandey said, ""He has no connection with the building in question; he only facilitated the deal as a broker. We have already submitted this in court.""The breakthrough came through the statement of an auto-rickshaw driver, Sunil Uchawane, who inadvertently became a key link in the investigation. Sunil, booked via an application by Vishal, had unknowingly transported the bag.Sunil told police that on May 31, around 1pm, he went near Church School in Nandbagh where a young man, suspected to be Vishal alias Vicky, handed him a bag. He was instructed to deliver it to Heera Bagh.About an hour later, upon reaching Heera Bagh Colony near Dewas Naka, another man received the bag and paid his fare. This revelation confirmed that the bag belonging to Sonam and Raja had remained in the flat even after their departure. SIT officials checked the CCTV footage, it was found that while the bag was taken to the flat, it did not come out when Sonam left the city.Two days later, Silom was seen taking it with him. It is suspected that Silom transferred the money and gold somewhere else before burning the electronic appliances and documents including phones, laptop and other items.","Shillong police officials recovered the charred remains of the bag which was brought back to Indore by key accused, Sonam, after the murder.

US-Iran tensions: Tehran vows 'proportionate response'; key ways it can retaliate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/us-iran-tensions-tehran-vows-proportionate-response-key-ways-it-can-retaliate/articleshow/122014965.cms,"Limited strikes or wider confrontation?

The Strait of Hormuz and cyber warfare

Retaliation could be delayed — or abandoned

The nuclear question looms large

'Hardliners in the Iranian regime may ultimately win the day'

Regional fallout and US response







Iran has promised a “proportionate response” to what it calls the United States’ “criminal aggression” after President Donald Trump confirmed that American forces had “obliterated” three of Iran’s nuclear facilities. While Trump hailed the strike as a military success, warning there were “many targets left,” Iran has vowed that its response will come; the only question is when and how.Iran’s foreign ministry said the country would “defend its territory, sovereignty, security and people by all force and means.” The Iranian military is now reportedly in charge of planning a retaliatory strike, according to Iran’s UN envoy Amir Saeid Iravani, who told the Security Council that Washington had “decided to destroy diplomacy.”“We will take all measures necessary,” Iravani said, adding that Iran’s response would be shaped by “timing, nature and scale” determined solely by its military.Iran’s dilemma lies in balancing a credible retaliation without triggering a full-scale regional war. It has experience with calibrated responses: following the 2020 US killing of General Qassem Soleimani, Tehran launched missiles at US bases in Iraq after warning them in advance.No lives were lost, but the message was clear.This time, however, experts suggest Iran may avoid advance notice. According to the BBC, Tehran retains roughly half of its original 3,000 missiles and has already drawn up a list of some 20 US bases in the region, including key sites like At-Tanf, Ain al-Asad, and Erbil in Iraq and Syria. Proxies could also be activated to carry out these attacks, mirroring past strategies.Sanam Vakil of Chatham House told The New York Times that Iran could strike “largely evacuated” US bases or re-activate regional partners like the Houthis in Yemen. Such a cautious, asymmetric campaign would allow Iran to maintain its image without escalating into direct confrontation.Another option is economic warfare. Tehran could attempt to choke the Strait of Hormuz — the strategic waterway through which nearly a third of global oil flows. The BBC reported that Iran might deploy sea mines or fast-attack boats to block shipping lanes, potentially causing a spike in global oil prices.Cyberattacks also remain a key tool in Iran’s arsenal. Alongside China, Russia and North Korea, Iran has cultivated advanced cyber capabilities. Attacks on US infrastructure or commercial entities could inflict damage without triggering immediate military retaliation.“Iran knew this was coming and will have prepared a chain of responses,” said Ellie Geranmayeh of the European Council on Foreign Relations, warning that attacks “will be swift and multilayered.”There are voices within Iran’s leadership arguing for restraint. A delayed response striking back when US forces are no longer on high alert could allow Tehran to save face without risking immediate retribution. Symbolic attacks on diplomatic missions or targeted assassinations of US-linked figures abroad are also being considered.However, such a strategy carries its own risks. Doing nothing may spare Iran further losses but risks weakening its domestic credibility. As conservative Tehran analyst Reza Salehi noted: “If we do not react, the US will not leave us alone.”Some experts argue that the regime may ultimately choose to recalibrate rather than retaliate. This includes restarting diplomacy, potentially via neutral mediators in Muscat or Rome. Yet such a path would demand significant concessions, especially around its nuclear enrichment programme something the regime has historically resisted.According to NYT reporting, Iran’s long-term takeaway from the strikes may be the need for a nuclear deterrent. Vali Nasr, an Iran scholar at Johns Hopkins University, said the strikes may push Iran to abandon cooperation with the IAEA and move towards nuclear armament.“This is the great irony,” Geranmayeh told NYT. “Although Trump has sought to eliminate the nuclear threat from Iran, he has now made it far more likely that Iran becomes a nuclear state.”Ayatollah Khamenei could authorise withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and expel international inspectors, effectively ending global oversight of Iran’s programme.While the International Atomic Energy Agency reported no radiation leakage after the US strikes — implying enriched uranium was likely moved, concerns remain that Iran’s stockpile is now hidden and unmonitored.Experts believe Iran now faces two critical choices. Jonathan Panikoff of the Atlantic Council explained: “Iran can choose to strike US bases in a limited fashion… or it could go all in and trigger a regional war.”Refraining from retaliation may limit further military damage but risks weakening the regime’s image. “If we do not react, the US will not leave us alone,” said conservative Tehran analyst Reza Salehi.A calculated response—such as targeting symbolic US sites—could appease hardliners without escalating to full-scale war. However, given Trump’s threats and the severity of the strikes, restraint seems unlikely. “Hardliners in the Iranian regime may ultimately win the day,” Panikoff noted, adding that asymmetric attacks or overseas terror operations remain a possibility.Iran’s past actions, like the Khobar Towers bombing and rocket attacks on US forces in Iraq, show both its capability and intent to retaliate. Its allies, including Yemen’s Houthis, have already threatened US naval forces.With over 40,000 American troops stationed across the region, in Bahrain, Qatar, Iraq and elsewhere, Washington is reinforcing its positions. Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has confirmed the deployment of additional assets, and non-essential diplomatic staff have been evacuated.Trump, while portraying the US operation as restrained, has made it clear that more force will follow if Iran escalates. “There will either be peace or there will be tragedy for Iran,” he warned.Still, many in Tehran believe the real tragedy is already unfolding. Iran’s UN envoy accused Israel of manipulating US policy, saying Netanyahu had succeeded in dragging the United States into “yet another costly and baseless war.”",Iran has promised a “proportionate response” to what it calls the United States’ “criminal aggression” President Donald Trump confirmed that American forces had “obliterated” three of Iran’s nuclear facilities.

GOP tax bill would ease regulations on gun silencers and some rifles and shotguns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/gop-tax-bill-would-ease-regulations-on-gun-silencers-and-some-rifles-and-shotguns/articleshow/122015054.cms,"GOP tax bill would ease regulations on gun silencers and some rifles and shotguns (Image: AP)





WASHINGTON: The massive tax and spending cuts package that President Donald Trump wants on his desk by July 4 would loosen regulations on gun silencers and certain types of rifles and shotguns, advancing a long time priority of the gun industry as Republican leaders in the House and Senate try to win enough votes to pass the bill.The guns provision was first requested in the House by Georgia Rep. Andrew Clyde, a Republican gun store owner who had initially opposed the larger tax package. The House bill would remove silencers - called ""suppressors"" by the gun industry - from a 1930s law that regulates firearms that are considered the most dangerous, eliminating a $200 tax while removing a layer of background checks.The Senate kept the provision on silencers in its version of the bill and expanded upon it, adding short-barreled, or sawed-off, rifles and shotguns.Republicans who have long supported the changes, along with the gun industry, say the tax infringes on Second Amendment rights. They say silencers are mostly used by hunters and target shooters for sport.""Burdensome regulations and unconstitutional taxes shouldn't stand in the way of protecting American gun owners' hearing,"" said Clyde, who owns two gun stores in Georgia and often wears a pin shaped like an assault rifle on his suit lapel.Democrats are fighting to stop the provision, which was unveiled days after two Minnesota state legislators were shot in their homes, as the bill speeds through the Senate. They argue that loosening regulations on silencers could make it easier for criminals and active shooters to conceal their weapons.""Parents don't want silencers on their streets, police don't want silencers on their streets,"" said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, D-NYThe gun language has broad support among Republicans and has received little attention as House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-SD, work to settle differences within the party on cuts to Medicaid and energy tax credits, among other issues. But it is just one of hundreds of policy and spending items included to entice members to vote for the legislation that could have broad implications if the bill is enacted within weeks, as Trump wants.Inclusion of the provision is also a sharp turn from the climate in Washington just three years ago when Democrats, like Republicans now, controlled Congress and the White House and pushed through bipartisan gun legislation. The bill increased background checks for some buyers under the age of 21, made it easier to take firearms from potentially dangerous people and sent millions of dollars to mental health services in schools.Passed in the summer of 2022, just weeks after the shooting of 19 children and two adults at a school in Uvalde, Texas, it was the most significant legislative response to gun violence in decades.Three years later, as they try to take advantage of their consolidated power in Washington, Republicans are packing as many of their long time priorities as possible, including the gun legislation, into the massive, wide-ranging bill that Trump has called ""beautiful.""""I'm glad the Senate is joining the House to stand up for the Second Amendment and our Constitution, and I will continue to fight for these priorities as the Senate works to pass President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill,"" said Texas Sen John Cornyn, who was one of the lead negotiators on the bipartisan gun bill in 2022 but is now facing a primary challenge from the right in his bid for re-election next year.If the gun provisions remain in the larger legislation and it is passed, silencers and the short-barrel rifles and shotguns would lose an extra layer of regulation that they are subject to under the National Firearms Act, passed in the 1930s in response to concerns about mafia violence. They would still be subject to the same regulations that apply to most other guns - and that includes possible loopholes that allow some gun buyers to avoid background checks when guns are sold privately or online.Larry Keane of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, who supports the legislation, says changes are aimed at helping target shooters and hunters protect their hearing. He argues that the use of silencers in violent crimes is rare. ""All it's ever intended to do is to reduce the report of the firearm to hearing safe levels,"" Keane says.Speaking on the floor before the bill passed the House, Rep Clyde said the bill restores Second Amendment rights from ""over 90 years of draconian taxes."" Clyde said Johnson included his legislation in the larger bill ""with the purest of motive.""""Who asked for it? I asked,"" said Clyde, who ultimately voted for the bill after the gun silencer provision was added.Clyde was responding to Rep Maxwell Frost, a 28-year-old Florida Democrat, who went to the floor and demanded to know who was responsible for the gun provision. Frost, who was a gun-control activist before being elected to Congress, called himself a member of the ""mass shooting generation"" and said the bill would help ""gun manufacturers make more money off the death of children and our people.""Among other concerns, control advocates say less regulation for silencers could make it harder for law enforcement to stop an active shooter.""There's a reason silencers have been regulated for nearly a century: They make it much harder for law enforcement and bystanders to react quickly to gunshots,"" said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety.Schumer and other Democrats are trying to convince the Senate parliamentarian to drop the language as she reviews the bill for policy provisions that aren't budget-related.""Senate Democrats will fight this provision at the parliamentary level and every other level with everything we've got,"" Schumer said earlier this month.","GOP tax bill would loosen regulations on gun silencers and certain types of rifles and shotguns.

The US Air Force B-2 Spirit bombers which dropped massive bunker-buster bombs on three Iranian nuclear facilities, arrived back at their Whiteman Air Force base home on Sunday (local time).""B-2 Spirit bombers recently returned safely to Whiteman AFB, Mo., after a successful 36-hour mission to the @CENTCOM (United States Central Command) area of responsibility,"" the US Strategic Command posted on X, and shared a video of a B-2 landing at the Whiteman facility.The base, about 73 miles (117 kilometers) southeast of Kansas City, is home to the 509th Bomb Wing, the only US military unit which operates the B-2, which is more famous as the stealth.The first group of four of the stealth aircraft did a loop around the base before approaching a runway from the north, while a final group of three arrived within 10 minutes, according to the Associated Press.The day before, the B-2s had been part of a wide-ranging plan involving deception and decoys to deliver what America's military leaders believe is a ""knockout blow"" to Iran's nuclear programme, which US ally Israel views as an ""existential threat"" and has been pummelling for more than a week.According to American officials, one group of the stealth aircraft headed west from the base on Saturday, as a decoy to throw off the Iranians.Another flight of seven B-2s quietly flew off eastward, ultimately executing in the Iran mission. Aided by refuelling tankers and fighter jets — some of which launched their own weapons — American pilots dropped 30,000-pound ""bunker buster"" bombs early Sunday local time in Iran on key nuclear plants in the Islamic Republic.As per officials, the mission, dubbed Operation Midnight Hammer, carried out a “precision strike” and “devastated the Iranian nuclear programme,"" even as they acknowledged an assessment was ongoing.

What does the court say about Garcia’s detention?





federal judge in Tennessee is set to order the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador earlier this year and is now facing human smuggling charges in the United States.The decision came on Sunday, when US mmagistrate Judge Barbara Holmes denied the government’s motion to keep Abrego Garcia detained while he awaits trial. A hearing is scheduled for Wednesday to finalize the conditions of his release.However, the US government has already filed a motion to appeal the ruling and has requested a stay on the release order. Agencies suggest that the US administration would not set Garcia free, as the Customs Enforcement might take him into custody and try to deport him.Originally from El Salvador, Abrego Garcia crossed into the United States illegally around 2011. In 2019, he was detained by immigration officials in Maryland.García has no criminal record in either the US or El Salvador and has never been charged with any gang-related activity. However, Trump officials claim he has ties to MS-13 — a violent criminal gang that started in Los Angeles in the 1980s and later spread to Central America.The investigation gained momentum after the Supreme Court ordered the federal government to facilitate his return from El Salvador, responding to rising public and legal pressure.In her ruling, Judge Holmes acknowledged that the release order may be “little more than an academic exercise,” given ICE’s probable intervention. Still, she concluded that the government had not presented sufficient evidence to prove Abrego Garcia posed a flight risk, a threat to the community, or a risk of obstructing justice.“Overall, the Court cannot find from the evidence presented that Abrego’s release clearly and convincingly poses an irremediable danger to other persons or to the community,” she wrote.During the June 13 hearing, acting US attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee, Rob McGuire, argued that ICE’s likely deportation attempt was a valid reason to keep Abrego Garcia in custody. Holmes countered that it was up to the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security to determine whether prosecution or deportation should take precedence.Assistant Federal Public Defender Will Allensworth, who represents Abrego Garcia, noted that while a deportation to El Salvador is barred, the government could consider removal to a third country. However, such a transfer would require proof that the receiving country agrees not to return him to El Salvador.",Kilmar Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported to El Salvador earlier this year.

The US administration issued a warning of a ""heightened threat environment"" in the United States after its military strikes on Iran's nuclear sites. The bulletin issued by the National terrorism Advisory System did not mention Operation Midnight Hammer but warned Americans of ""low-level cyber attacks"" against US networks amid the ongoing ""Iran conflict"".""The ongoing Iran conflict is causing a heightened threat environment in the United States. Low-level cyber attacks against US networks by pro-Iranian hacktivists are likely, and cyber actors affiliated with the Iranian government may conduct attacks against US networks,"" it said.""Iran also has a long-standing commitment to target US Government officials it views as responsible for the death of an Iranian military commander killed in January 2020. The likelihood of violent extremists in the Homeland independently mobilizing to violence in response to the conflict would likely increase if Iranian leadership issued a religious ruling calling for retaliatory violence against targets in the Homeland. Multiple recent Homeland terrorist attacks have been motivated by anti-Semitic or anti-Israel sentiment, and the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict could contribute to US-based individuals plotting additional attacks,"" the advisory said.Iran had previously vowed to retaliate if the U.S. joined Israel's attack, which started June 13 with Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear and military targets. More than 650 people have been killed and at least 2,000 have been wounded in Iran since then, according to a Washington-based Iranian human rights group. At least 24 have also been killed in Israel, and hundreds wounded, in Iran's retaliatory missile and drone strikes, according to estimates from the Israeli military.

Seven B-2 bombers were deployed for Operation Midnight Hammer to destroy three nuclear plants in Iran in almost radio silence. They took off from the Whiteman Air Force Base outside Kansas City on Friday and flew 18 hours to enter Iran. After demolishing their targets, the B-2s were on their way back home, unattached. The bombers refuelled several times mid-air, and as they are stealth bombers, they were virtually invisible to Oranian radar.B-2 bombers are equipped for such long-haul flights. There is enough room for one pilot to lie down while the other flies the plane. There is a toilet, a refrigerator and a microwave for snacks. The B-2 first entered service in 1997 and each one costs more than $2 billion; the US Air Force has a fleet of 19, after losing one in a crash in 2008. One of the B-2’s most striking features is its unique design. Lacking a fuselage or tail, the aircraft is a flying wing, which necessitates highly precise control of its surfaces.With a wingspan of 172 feet and a crew of just two pilots — the B-2 relies on automation to help complete long-haul flights. The 37 hours spent to attack Fordow marked the longest B-2 bomber mission since the initial American assault on Afghanistan following the Sept.11, 2001, terrorist attacks.There were layers of secrecy and minute planning behind every stage of the operation. While the B-2 bombers moved towards the east, a decoy group of B-2 bombers moved towards the west.As the attack bombers approached Iran, they were joined by support aircraft and a fleet of fighter jets. “The B-2s linked up with escort and support aircraft in a complex, tightly timed maneuver requiring exact synchronization across multiple platforms in a narrow piece of airspace, all done with minimal communications,” Gen Daniel Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in the Pentagon briefing.The lead B-2 bomber dropped two GBU-57 “bunker buster” munitions on the “first of several aim points at Fordow."" “The remaining bombers then hit their targets, as well, with a total of 14 MOPs (Massive Ordnance Penetrators) dropped against two nuclear target areas,” Gen Caine added.","Seven B-2 bombers were deployed for Operation Midnight Hammer to destroy three nuclear plants in Iran in almost radio silence.

All planes are now outside of Iran air space. A full payload of BOMBS was dropped on the primary site, Fordow.” He added, “There is not another military in the World that could have done this. NOW IS THE TIME FOR PEACE!” The president is expected to deliver a televised address at 10pm ET.The strikes signal a major shift in US policy, as Trump has now committed American military power to support Israel’s ongoing operations against Iran. The Israeli government had already spent more than a week targeting Iran’s air defences and missile systems before the US joined in.The White House confirmed that Israel was informed in advance of the US attack.A US official told Reuters that B-2 stealth bombers were used to hit the targets. These bombers are capable of carrying 30,000-pound bunker-busting bombs, making them suitable for deep underground sites like Fordow.Although Trump had earlier said he would decide within two weeks whether to act, preparations for military action intensified over the weekend. According to NBC News, he is not currently planning additional strikes inside Iran.Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei had also warned that it would be bad if the US got involved in the conflict with Israel.","Iranian State TV aired a bold warning to US President Donald Trump.

'Trump misled the country': Hakeem Jeffries

Hakeem Jeffries statement





White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has clarified that the Donald Trump administration made ""bipartisan courtesy calls"" to brief the Congressional leadership well before the US forces conducted air strikes on nuclear facilities in Iran - codenamed Operation Midnight Hammer.Leavitt's statement came after several US media outlets, including CNN and Axios, claimed that the Trump administration - the US President is a Republican - briefed only the top two Republicans in the Congress (House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate majority leader John Thune) before the operation.""This is fake news. The White House made bipartisan courtesy calls to Congressional leadership and spoke to ⁦@SenSchumer before the strike. ⁦⁦@RepJeffries could not be reached until after, but he was briefed. Please retract,"" she wrote on X.Leavitt was referring to Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries, both Democrats.Earlier, it was reported that Schumer was informed shortly before Trump's address to the nation on the mission in Iran, while Jeffries came to know well after the attack.Meanwhile, in a statement on X, Jeffries accused Trump of ""misleading"" the nation, and called for an immediate and classified Congressional briefing.""President Trump misled the country about his intentions, failed to seek congressional authorization, and risks American entanglement in a potentially disastrous war in the Middle East,"" the Democrat said.""Congress must be fully and immediately briefed in a classified setting,"" he added.","White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the administration made ""bipartisan courtesy calls"" to Congressional leadership well before the US forces conducted air strikes on nuclear facilities in Iran.

US-Iran tensions spike: Washington issues 'worldwide caution'; Tehran says response to American strikes will be 'proportionate',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-iran-tensions-spike-washington-issues-worldwide-caution-tehran-says-response-to-american-strikes-will-be-proportionate/articleshow/122013293.cms,"Global alert: Exercise increased caution



Türkiye: Avoid Southeast, maintain low profile

Lebanon: Non-essential staff ordered to depart

Saudi Arabia: Avoid military sites





The United States has issued a sweeping global security alert for its citizens following its military strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities. The State Department warned of potential reprisals against Americans, and ordered the departure of non-essential diplomatic staff from Lebanon, while also issuing specific advisories for Türkiye and Saudi Arabia.The US missile strikes which President Donald Trump claimed had “completely and fully obliterated” Iran’s nuclear facilities have provoked fierce threats from Tehran, which has vowed a “proportionate response” at a time and place of its choosing. With Israeli air raids continuing deep into Iranian territory and Tehran’s Revolutionary Guard launching retaliatory missile attacks, fears of a prolonged confrontation have grown.Iran has signalled that US military bases and regional allies could be targeted if used in attacks against it. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s advisor Ali Akbar Velayati warned that “any country used by the US to strike Iran will be a legitimate target for our armed forces.”“The Department of State advises US citizens worldwide to exercise increased caution,” the alert read. In light of “disruptions to travel and periodic closure of airspace across the Middle East,” and the potential for demonstrations against US citizens, travellers were urged to consult the most recent travel advisories and country-specific information.The warning directs citizens to visit the Department’s website for up-to-date guidance and security alerts.The US Embassy in Türkiye has cautioned its personnel to avoid the consular district of Adana in the country’s southeast, encompassing 22 provinces. “Negative sentiment toward US foreign policy may prompt actions against US or Western interests,” the alert said, citing risks of demonstrations, graffiti, boycotts and anti-American rhetoric.Americans in Türkiye were advised to avoid protest areas, monitor local media, and “exercise caution and stay alert at locations publicly associated with the United States or Israel or frequented by Westerners.”In Beirut, the State Department on ordered the departure of non-emergency government staff and family members due to a “volatile and unpredictable security situation.” While flights remain operational at Rafic Hariri International Airport, the embassy noted that “some airlines have suspended or cancelled flights,” urging citizens to monitor news updates and leave while commercial options are still available.“We remind US citizens to continue to exercise caution,” the embassy said, stressing the uncertain and rapidly evolving nature of the conflict.The US Mission to Saudi Arabia issued a separate advisory warning American citizens and its own staff to “limit non-essential travel to any military installations in the region.” The alert acknowledged the fluid situation following Israel’s military campaign and the US strikes, urging Americans to prepare personal emergency plans and review existing travel arrangements.“Crises can happen unexpectedly while travelling or living abroad, and a good plan helps you think through potential scenarios,” it added, with assurances that embassy staffing and consular services remain unaffected for now.The alerts come as Washington’s intervention in Israel’s war with Iran escalates regional instability. Israeli forces continued their aerial bombardment of Iranian targets on Sunday, hitting missile sites and infrastructure in Tehran, Hamedan and Kermanshah. Iran’s response has included launching long-range missiles at Israel and threatening further escalation.Iran’s UN ambassador accused the US of “destroying diplomacy,” while other officials insisted that Iran’s nuclear programme though damaged was not completely halted. “Even if nuclear sites are destroyed, game isn’t over,” wrote Ali Shamkhani, another advisor to Khamenei.","U.S. State Department issues global security alert for its citizens.

US President Donald Trump on Sunday (local time) appeared to support a potential regime change in Iran, seemingly contradicting his own administration's stand that Operation Midnight Hammer - US air strikes on three nuclear sites in Iran - was not aimed at bringing about a regime change in the Islamic Republic.Also Read: What is Operation Midnight Hammer?

"Day after deciding to nominate Trump for peace Nobel, Pakistan blows hot at US for Iran strikes",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/day-after-deciding-to-nominate-trump-for-peace-nobel-pak-blows-hot-at-us-for-iran-strikes/articleshow/122013603.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: Pakistan found itself in an embarrassing diplomatic bind as American bombs rained on Iran early Sunday, barely 24 hours after Islamabad's surprise decision to nominate US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize.The airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites at Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan prompted the Shehbaz Sharif govt to issue a statement criticising the US for what it said was a violation of “all norms of international law”.The prelude to the foreign affairs ministry’s condemnation of the attacks was mounting domestic backlash over the timing and political wisdom of the Shehbaz govt’s Nobel move.""This is diplomatic inconsistency at its worst,"" said former ambassador Maleeha Lodhi. ""You can't praise a man for peace one day and stay silent when he orders bombings the next.""Just a day earlier, Islamabad had announced it would formally nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, citing his role in “halting” the India-Pakistan conflict in May. Officials highlighted his rare White House meeting with Pakistan's army chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir, and a purported backchannel hotline with Delhi as evidence of “effective US intervention”.The forced change in tone within a day was as dramatic as Trump transitioning from “peacemaker” to aggressor.“Pakistan condemns the US attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities which follow the series of attacks by Israel. We are gravely concerned at the possible further escalation of tensions in the region,” the foreign ministry said.“Iran has the legitimate right to defend itself under the UN Charter…Any further escalation of tensions will have severely damaging implications for the region and beyond.”Deputy PM and foreign minister Ishaq Dar posted on X a message expressing solidarity with Iran. “Met my dear brother, Iran’s foreign minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi @araghchi, today on the sidelines of the 51st OIC CFM in Istanbul…I reaffirmed our unwavering support for Iran’s sovereignty, territorial integrity, and its right to self-defence under the UN Charter,” he wrote.Earlier in the day, criticism poured in from various quarters for the Shehbaz govt’s Trump tilt, with commentator Talat Hussain terming the move ""pathetic"" and saying it revealed a ""colonised mindset desperate for American approval”.The backlash reflects deeper unease within Pakistan, where public support for Iran and Palestine runs high. ""There's growing public anger over inconsistency,"" said political analyst Mosharraf Zaidi. ""It weakens Pakistan's moral position and suggests a transactional approach to diplomacy.""Behind the scenes, officials say the govt is pursuing a difficult but pragmatic strategy: maintaining ties with Washington to ease economic pressure and retain diplomatic space in its conflict with India. But the optics of nominating Trump just before he authorised strikes on a Muslim-majority nation have complicated that calculation significantly.Online, the blowback has been swift and unforgiving. Hashtags like #NobelForWar and #TrumpNominationShame trended on Pakistani Twitter (X), amplifying criticism of what many see as a diplomatic own goal. The Nobel nomination, intended as a diplomatic coup, appears to have backfired spectacularly.","Pakistan condemns U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites at Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan.

Pakistan Condemns U.S. Strikes On Iran A Day After Nobel Peace Prize Endorsement For Donald Trump





The Pakistani government and its powerful military establishment are facing a wave of public backlash after formally recommending US President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, a move that drew widespread condemnation following the US airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities.Pakistan’s deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar sent a letter to the Nobel Committee in Norway, crediting Trump’s “decisive diplomatic intervention” during the recent India-Pakistan standoff. But the recommendation triggered a storm on social media after Trump ordered attacks on Iran’s Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan nuclear sites, an operation he called a “historic moment” and one that escalated regional tensions.On X (formerly Twitter), users accused the Pakistani government of appeasing its “master.” One user mocked, “Pakistanis, beware! After the attack on Iran, PM Shehbaz might not only award Trump the Nobel Peace Prize, but also Tamgha-e-Jurat, Tamgha-e-Shujaat, Tamgha-e-Basalat, Tamgha-e-Imtiaz, and perhaps even the Nishan-e-Haider!”Veteran journalist Ameer Abbas recalled that PML-N leader Khawaja Saad Rafique had once likened Trump to Genghis Khan and Hitler.“Now, the same government nominates him for the Nobel Peace Prize. Who is orchestrating such shameful and cowardly decisions?” he asked.Raheeq Abbasi, political analyst and columnist, noted the irony, “Trump, who vetoed the Gaza ceasefire 8 times and is protested across the West for war crimes, is being nominated for a Nobel by the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Is there no sense of honour left?”The backlash cut across ideological lines. Some users accused the military establishment of calling the shots. “The uncrowned kings are ready to sell out the nation whenever they please,” wrote Major (R) Asim.Another user, Jarjees Ahmad, called out the “supreme level of hypocrisy”, “We’re nominating someone involved in the massacre of Palestinians while claiming to stand with Iran.”Aamir Khan added, “What greater betrayal could there be to Muslims, our country, and the people of Pakistan?”The Pakistani government has yet to respond officially to the criticism.","Pakistan's deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar sent a letter to the Nobel Committee in Norway, crediting Trump’s “decisive diplomatic intervention” during the recent India-Pakistan standoff.
