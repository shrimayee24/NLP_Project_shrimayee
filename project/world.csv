Court acquits dad in Pocso case due to lack of evidence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/court-acquits-dad-in-pocso-case-due-to-lack-of-evidence/articleshow/124837414.cms,"Judge Raps Police For Poor Probe

MUMBAI: The Dindoshi Special Pocso Court acquitted a 35-year-old man accused of repeatedly raping his minor daughter, citing lack of evidence and contradictions in the prosecution's case.Criticising the police for a shoddy investigation, the court said that the investigating officer failed to record a supplementary statement of the victim after receiving the medical papers and did not seize the clothes of the victim and accused for forensic analysis.Special Judge Smt Ashwini D Lokhande, while acquitting the father, said that he was in judicial custody since his arrest in 2019 when the case was registered by Kandivli police station.According to the public prosecutor, Geeta Malankar, the alleged incidents took place between 2020 and 2022, when the victim was aged between 8 and 10 years.However, the Special Pocso Court observed that the victim's testimony did not support the allegation of sexual assault.In her deposition, the girl stated that her father beat her and her mother after an argument over mobile phone use but did not mention any act of sexual assault.The judge noted that she retracted from her earlier statements to the police and before the magistrate and did not provide any incriminating evidence against the accused.The victim's mother, who was also examined as a witness, denied the allegation that her husband committed any sexual act with their daughter.She claimed the police did not read the contents of the complaint to her before she signed it.The court also noted that there were frequent quarrels between the couple, and the mother often stayed at her maternal home, indicating family discord.The medical evidence, too, did not support the prosecution. The doctor who examined the child, did not find any internal or external injuries on the victim's private parts and gave no opinion regarding sexual assault in her report.""The evidence of the prosecution witnesses is not sufficient to prove the charges. There is no iota of evidence to draw any adverse inference against the accused,"" the court observed. Advocate Suvarna Avhad Vast for the accused said that his client was falsely implicated in the case.","The Dindoshi Special Pocso Court acquitted a 35-year-old man accused of repeatedly raping his minor daughter.

West Bengal Police Arrest Three in Connection with Durgapur Gang-Rape Case

My mother treated Phaltan doctor like own daughter: Sister of arrested techie





PUNE: The Satara police arrested a techie and a police sub-inspector on Saturday in connection with the alleged rape and abetment of suicide of a 28-year-old doctor employed at the Phaltan subdistrict hospital.While the techie was arrested early in the morning, the police sub-inspector surrendered before the Phaltan rural police late in the night, a senior police officer said.“A court remanded the techie in four-day police custody till Oct 28,” said Satara superintendent of police Tushar Doshi.The brother and sister of the techie, speaking to TOI, denied the claim that he was arrested from a farmhouse in Pune. “My brother was arrested from our house in Phaltan. We had called him and told him to surrender. His social media records and call details have been given to the police. My brother never called the doctor. Instead, it was the doctor who used to call him repeatedly and harass him,” said the brother of the accused.Doctors’ associations in the state demanded transfer of the case to the state CID/ SIT to ensure an “independent, fair, and transparent investigation”.The doctor had been paying a monthly rent of Rs 4,000 to the family of the accused and residing at the place for the past year.The techie’s younger sister said, “Last month, my brother came to Phaltan to recover from dengue infection. At that time, this doctor treated him, and they exchanged numbers. Some 15 days ago, the doctor proposed marriage to my brother. My brother turned down the proposal. During Diwali, the doctor seemed tense, but we thought it might be a work-related issue. She was like a family member to us, and my mother used to treat her like her own daughter. ”The police said during questioning on Saturday, the arrested techie also claimed that the doctor used to harass him by insisting that he marry her and maintain a physical relationship with her. “A large number of chats and call recordings between the accused and the deceased have been found in which she is speaking about stress, pressure, etc.” a police officer said.The police are also investigating whether the accused sub-inspector — who is also named in the FIR for rape and suicide abetment, and comes from Beed, the same district as the doctor — knew her or had any relationship with her.Following the doctor’s suicide, police discovered a note written on her palm, naming the sub-inspector and the landlord’s son for driving her to take the extreme step by subjecting her to physical and mental harassment over the past five months. Based on this note and other evidence, such as WhatsApp chats exchanged between the doctor and the techie, an FIR was registered on Friday under sections 64 (rape) and 108 (abetment of suicide) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) against the two suspects.SP Tushar Doshi said, “A woman ended her life, and there might be some truth to her allegations. We are trying to establish everything. It is a challenging case as she had not complained about this earlier. Technical evidence and WhatsApp chats will be verified, but again, that can only prove that there was sexual contact. Whether there was any blackmail angle is what the investigation will bring to the fore.”Doctors’ associations in the state demanded the transfer of the case to the state CID/SIT to ensure an independent, fair, and transparent investigation, insisting on a time-bound completion of the inquiry and the public release of its findings.Additionally, the associations are seeking accountability from administrative officers who allegedly ignored repeated complaints.Dr Sachin Patil, the president of Central Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD), said, “We have written to the chief minister to personally intervene in this issue and to ensure that the case is handled with utmost seriousness. There is a sense of immense grief and collective outrage amongst the medical fraternity. As per statements from her colleagues, the doctor repeatedly informed her seniors about being mentally and physically harassed by the two men. Despite clear warnings that she was under extreme distress, no effective preventive action was taken by the administration.”The Central MARD, Association of Medical Officers (AMO), and Federation of All India Medical Association (FAIMA) have condemned the tragic death and held black ribbon protest on Saturday. In a note issued by these organisations, they have demanded immediate action and warned that if their demands are not met, doctors will intensify their agitation and initiate statewide protests.Additionally, Health Rights NGO Jan Aarogya Abhiyan (JAA) has written to the CM requesting the case be registered as “institutional murder’. Dr Abhay Shukla, the national co-convenor of JAA, said, “We believe that the death of this young doctor is caused by patriarchal attitudes, administrative apathy, and negligence within the system. We demand an independent judicial inquiry committee and also request the govt to implement a ‘Women’s Safety Policy’ in all govt hospitals across Maharashtra. ”CM Devendra Fadnavis on Friday spoke to the Satara SP and directed the immediate suspension of the sub-inspector named in the note.","The Satara police arrested a techie and a police sub-inspector on Saturday in connection with the alleged rape and abetment of suicide of a 28-year-old doctor employed at the Phaltan subdistrict hospital.

’Naxal-Maoist Terror Nearly Wiped Out Across India’: PM Modi Hails Police, CRPF, BSF

NEW DELHI:Rejecting the CPI(Maoist) central committee’s (CC) “traitor” tag thrown at him at fellow Naxal leader Bhupathi alias ‘Sonu’ in view of their recent surrender, CC member Rupesh has said that they had laid down arms in line with the slain general secretary Basavaraj ’s final call to ‘partymen’ to cease armed operations against the security forces and explore talks with the Centre.In a video statement shared with TOI, Rupesh – who is currently in Chhattisgarh – can be heard rejecting the CPI(Maoist) latest claim that Basavaraju had had a rethink on his stance favouring a ceasefire “to save the party, cadres and movement” -- communicated in multiple statements since March 2025 -- after the Centre had refrained from toning down anti-Naxal operations in ‘core’ areas of Maoists.He said that Basavaraj had instead, taking a pragmatic line in a letter sent to all politburo (PB)/CC members and a separate communication dispatched to Rupesh days before he was neutralised in an encounter, allowed cadres to retaliate with arms when cornered by the forces, while maintaining that ceasefire and talks were the only way forward. Basavaraj did leave it to the CC core committee to take a final decision in this regard – time was, in fact, sought from the govt to get the scattered CC members together for a meeting – but the top leader was killed in an encounter with the forces before this could fructify.“It is true that till B R Dada (Basavaraj) was killed in May, he maintained the view that conditions are ideal for abandoning armed struggle and starting talks with to the govt about our future,” Rupesh said, saying that every PB/CC member had received this message.“I had personally met Devji (current CPI Maoist general secretary) and another CC member after that,” he said but added that Devji was not in favour of ceasefire and talks.“Why is it that when a meeting of Dandakaranya Special Zonal committee (DKSZC) was held recently in south Bastar, the surrender plan of north sub-zonal bureau, though known to the leaders, was never brought up? Why is it that Basavaraj’s final letter to the PB/CC members has not been shown to the cadres?” Rupesh asked. This, a Chhattisgarh police officer indicated, suggests that Devji and CC members Sangram and Hidma, along with senior cadres Barse Deve and Pappa Rao, have failed to communicate the collective decision of the CPI(Maoist), taken under Basavaraj, to end armed struggle, to the lower ranks.Rupesh said the letter sent to him by Basavaraj, ruling out any ideological compromise behind the ceasefire, was shared by him and deliberated upon by cadres of the north sub-zonal bureau of the DKSZC, who passed it down to the divisional committee and area committee members. “It was a collective and conscious decision made by all of us to shun violence and return to the mainstream,” he said, adding that many of south sub-zonal committee cadres may also be wanting to follow suit.Rupesh said Vijay and Lokesh, two DKSZC leaders killed recently, had also favoured a ceasefire. Bhupathi initially opposed it but came around, he added.","A total of 21 Maoist cadres, including 13 women, surrendered with 18 weapons, in North Bastar Kanker on Sunday.

‘Not Just Trade But Cultural Partners’: PM Modi Virtually Addresses ASEAN Summit In Malaysia

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Sunday called on the nation to mark the 150th year of ' Vande Mataram ', describing India's national song as ""a surge of emotions in our hearts"" and ""a mantra that connects 140 crore Indians through the energy of unity"".""Vande Mataram - this contains so many emotions, so many energies.

Even today, Parliament closes each session with an instrumental version rather than a vocal rendition.Modi also recalled how the song's first public rendition was by Rabindranath Tagore at the 1896 session of Congress. ""Vande Mataram was composed 150 years ago, and in 1896, Tagore sang it for the first time,"" he said.Modi also paid tribute to Komaram Bheem - the tribal leader who spearheaded the Gond rebellion against the British and feudal Nizams of Hyderabad in 1928 - as well as tribal icon and freedom fighter Birsa Munda ahead of his birth anniversary on Nov 15, celebrated as 'Janajateeya Gaurav Diwas'.

Entered the US illegally but has work authorization, REAL ID



K restriction



Driving under the influence







Sikh driver Jashanpreet Singh, the 21-year-old driver, accused of the crash that killed three people in California, pleaded not guilty to all the charges brought against him -- as a major controversy broke out over Indian truck drivers endangering lives in America. Singh pleaded not guilty to three counts of gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and one count of driving under the influence of a drug. He was appointed a public defender and remained in jail without bail. His next court appearance has been scheduled for November 4, when he will require a Punjabi interpreter.The requirement of a Punjabi interpreter proved that Singh does not know enough English, yet got a driving license for which English knowledge is mandatory.The Department of Homeland Security said Jashanpreet entered the US illegally from India in 2022 during the Biden administration. He has Employment Authorization Documents valid up to 2030 and a commercial driver's license to operate a semitruck. Singh's license is a federal REAL ID, which he was entitled to receive as the federal government gave him a legal status.While California blamed the Trump administration for extending Singh's work authorization, the Trump administration claimed that California violated federal law by allowing Singh to continue driving when he should have been disqualified.In June this year, California issued Singh -- who is an asylum seeker -- a restricted, non-domiciled CDL with a ""K"" restriction, limiting driving to in-state. K restriction is meant for those below 21 years. In September, the federal government paused all issuances of non-domiciled CDLs. In October, Singh turned 21, and his ""K"" restriction was removed. DOT officials say, if California had followed the new rule, Singh's license would have been denied because of his status as an asylum seeker.While Singh pleaded not guilty, his family in India claimed that he is a baptized Sikh and never does drugs. But the toxicology report claimed that he was driving under the influence and could not press the brak,e causing the mishap.","Jashanpreet Singh pleaded not guilty to three counts of gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and one count of driving under the influence of a drug.

World’s 9 weakest passports in 2025: Countries with the least travel freedom,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/travel/destinations/worlds-9-weakest-passports-in-2025-countries-with-the-least-travel-freedom/articleshow/124721967.cms,"Afghanistan (Rank 104, Score 25)

Palestinian Territory (Rank 99, Score 38)

Libya (Rank 98, Score 39)





A passport is an important travel document for those who wish to explore other countries. It allows people international travel freedom. But the ranking of passports also matters. If a country’s passport is strong, the residents can often travel visa free or visa-on-arrival facilities to several nations. But when a country’s passport is weak, it only creates issues in obtaining a visa and also lacks several other powers that come along with strong passports.The rankings are reflection of much deeper and larger issues including political instability, limited diplomatic influence and international relations. These are prime reasons restricting travel freedom for citizens of the affected countries.According to the latest (2025) Henley Passport Index ranking, the passport of Afghanistan is the weakest and grants visa-free access to only 25 countries. On this note, let’s have a look at 9 weakest passports in the world.Afghanistan holds the 104th position on the global passport index, making it the least powerful passport worldwide.Afghan nationals can enter only 25 countries without a visa. This restricted travel freedom stems primarily from ongoing conflict, political instability, and limited diplomatic influence. For the majority of international destinations, Afghan travelers face lengthy and often uncertain visa application procedures, significantly limiting their global mobility.Syria ranks second on the list, largely due to prolonged civil conflict and political instability. Only a handful of countries allow Syrians visa-free or visa-on-arrival entry, while most impose strict entry requirements. Security concerns remain the primary reason behind such limited travel access for Syrian passport holders.Iraq’s passport also offers limited visa-free access. It is because of political instability, security issues, and the country’s changing diplomatic relationships. Iraqi passport holders commonly need to apply for visas in advance.Pakistan’s passport ranks low primarily due to ongoing political instability, security concerns, and strained cross-border relations. Citizens frequently face lengthy and complex visa procedures, with a relatively high rate of application rejections compared to many other countries.Yemen has a bad security situation, the state of the country is greatly affected by political instability. The passport has limited reach, leaving many destinations off-limits. Humanitarian crises are also there. Outside travel requires careful planning and prior approvals.Somalia’s passport is affected by long-standing political instability. There are security challenges too and a limited diplomatic network. Many countries need Somalis to obtain visas before travel. Progress in governance and expanded bilateral relations is needed.Nepal’s low rank reflects a passport that Nepalis still require visas for many popular destinations. They might enjoy easier travel within South Asia and some neighboring countries, but long-haul travel involves advance visa applications.Palestinian territories also face a lot of issues. There are diplomatic and recognition issues. Passport holders require lengthy full visa processing. Geopolitical constraints and limited state recognition continue to restrict the mobility of many Palestinians.Libya’s passport has slightly higher access, yet remains burdened by political instability and security issues. Libyans frequently face prior-visa requirements and unpredictable processing times. Any sustained improvements in political stability and international relations would likely be the principal route to expand Libyan citizens’ travel freedoms.These nine weak passports of the countries only reflect how security concerns, political instability, cross border tensions, and diplomatic relationships directly affect not only international but everyday freedom to travel. It’s a difficult travel situation for the citizens of these nine nations. With lengthy visa processes and no surety of obtaining one, international mobility is often a matter of careful planning and several official approvals. It also limits work options, education, or family visits abroad, and personal opportunities too.Ultimately, a passport is more than a travel document - it’s a reflection of a nation’s global standing and stability. As countries work toward peace, stronger governance, and better diplomatic ties, their citizens may someday gain the freedom to move across borders with greater ease and dignity.","According to the latest Henley Passport Index ranking, the passport of Afghanistan is the weakest and grants visa-free access to only 25 countries.

How footage from CCTV cam foiled bid to pass off murder as fire accident





NEW DELHI: A 21-year-old woman, her ex-boyfriend and his friend have been arrested for allegedly killing her live-in partner, a UPSC aspirant, in north Delhi's Timarpur earlier this month and staging it as a fire incident.According to police, she planned the murder as she suspected he possessed a hard disk containing ""objectionable"" videos and photographs of her.The accused - Amrita Chauhan, her ex-boyfriend Sumit Kashyap (27) and his friend Sandeep Kumar (29) - hail from UP's Moradabad, where they were nabbed.On Oct 6, police were alerted to a fire on a fourth-floor flat in Gandhi Vihar. Firefighters found a charred body inside, later identified as 32-year-old Ramkesh Meena. A case under sections related to causing death by negligence was registered at the time.CCTV footage showed two masked persons entering the building on the day of the incident. After 39 minutes, one person could be seen exiting, and at 2.57am, a woman with another individual left the premises. The fire broke out shortly afterward, raising suspicion.According to sources, the woman's identity was established and her phone's location found near the site of the incident. When police tried to contact her, it was switched off. Several raids in Moradabad led to her arrest on Oct 18. Cops said she confessed to the crime and revealed the involvement of Kashyap and Kumar as well as the motive. Police recovered the hard disk, a trolley bag and the victim's shirt.Kashyap and Kumar were subsequently arrested on Oct 22 and 23, respectively. Police later invoked BNS sections related to murder, common intention, and mischief by injury, inundation, fire or explosive substance against the trio.Police said an inquiry revealed Chauhan and Meena, who met in May this year, had a live-in relationship. ""She claimed he secretly recorded obscene videos and refused to delete them,"" an officer said.When she shared her grievance with Kashyap, he allegedly roped in his friend to retrieve the hard disk. Chauhan, a BSc Forensic Science student and an avid watcher of crime series, hatched the plan to murder Meena and make it seem as though he died in a fire, police said.The trio allegedly thrashed and strangled Meena, before pouring oil, ghee and wine over his body. Kashyap placed a gas cylinder near the victim's head, opened the regulator and ignited it with a lighter while Chauhan secured the flat's iron gate from the inside, said police. They allegedly stole the hard disk, two laptops and other items belonging to Meena. About an hour later, the cylinder exploded, completely burning the victim.Confirming the arrests, DCP (North) Raja Banthia said Kashyap worked as an LPG distributor while Kumar was a graduate preparing for SSC CGL exams.","A 21-year-old woman, her ex-boyfriend and his friend have been arrested for allegedly killing her live-in partner, a UPSC aspirant, in north Delhi.

NEW DELHI: A 19-year-old DU student suffered burn injuries after being attacked with acid, allegedly by a stalker and his two associates, in northwest Delhi's Ashok Vihar on Sunday.In her statement, the victim, a second-year student enrolled in a non-collegiate programme at a college, said she was on her way to attend an additional class in Ashok Vihar when she was attacked around 11am. Police were alerted around 12pm after she was taken to a hospital with burns.""She was walking towards the college when a man she knew, identified as Jitender, along with his associates Ishan and Arman, approached on a bike. Ishan allegedly handed over a bottle to Arman, who threw acid at her. The trio then fled,"" a senior police officer said.As the victim tried to protect her face, she sustained injuries on both the hands and arms, the officer said. He added that she alleged Jitender had been stalking her for nearly a year, and a heated argument had taken place between them about a month ago.The victim told TOI that she was on her way to submit an assignment.""I usually take a rickshaw from home and then walk the rest of the way to college. I was walking through a lane and hadn't noticed anyone following me. Suddenly, a bike came and they attacked me and sped away.""As the attackers came near, the woman instinctively raised her bag to shield her face. The chemical splashed onto her hands and bag, leaving her with severe burns.

Four hospitals refused to admit him due to his critical condition, according to an anonymous official.Chandel was finally admitted to Regency Hospital, where doctors performed a two-hour surgery. He received 14 stitches on his head, confirmed Assistant Commissioner of Police (Kalyanpur) Ranjeet Kumar.""Instead of arresting those behind the murderous attack, police booked my son, who is fighting for his life,"" said the victim's mother, Neelam Singh Chandel. She alleged that the accused were ""well connected with police"" and managed to file a false extortion case against her and her injured son the same night.Police have arrested three suspects - Amar Singh Chauhan, Vijay Singh, and Nikhil Tiwari - on charges of attempted murder. The fourth accused, Prince Srivastava, remains at large.ACP Kumar acknowledged that an extortion FIR was initially registered against Chandel based on Chauhan's complaint. However, a fresh case was filed after the truth about the brutal assault came to light.Authorities are continuing their search for the fourth accused, Prince Srivastava.","Abhijeet Singh Chandel, a first-year LLB student, visited a nearby pharmacy.

LUCKNOW: A massive fire broke out at the Northern Railway Divisional Hospital in Alambagh early Monday morning, causing panic among patients and staff. The blaze, suspected to have started from a short circuit in the CCTV server room on the ground floor, quickly filled the three-storey building with thick smoke.The incident occurred around 5.30am when flames and smoke were seen coming from the server room. The fire spread through electrical wiring, setting off alarms across the hospital. The Critical Care Unit (CCU) on the first floor was soon covered in smoke, prompting staff to act swiftly.Chief Fire Officer Ankush Mittal said more than 22 critical and elderly patients were rescued using stretchers and wheelchairs and shifted to another ward, where oxygen and medical support were arranged.Two fire tenders from Alambagh and Hazratganj fire stations reached the hospital within minutes after receiving the alert at 5.38am. Under the supervision of Station Officer Dharmpal Singh, firefighters battled the blaze for over an hour before bringing it under control. Smoke guns and exhaust fans were used to clear the building, preventing any major casualties.The server room and its electrical wiring were completely damaged, but there were no injuries or loss of life, thanks to the quick evacuation.The emergency ward on the ground floor, which had over ten patients, remained safe as hospital staff sealed it off to prevent the spread of smoke.Chief Medical Superintendent Dr Sangeeta Sagar confirmed that all patients, attendants, and staff were safe. She said, “The fire was caused by a suspected short circuit in the server room. Our team and the fire department acted swiftly to prevent a major disaster.”A technical inquiry has been ordered to ascertain the exact cause of the fire. Early reports indicate that an electrical overload in the server and CCTV system may have triggered it.Fire officials praised the prompt response of hospital staff and rescue teams, stating that any delay could have led to serious cases of smoke inhalation.Normal hospital operations resumed after safety checks, and the situation was declared fully under control by 7am.","A massive fire broke out at the Northern Railway Divisional Hospital in Alambagh early Monday morning.

Who is Amjad Al-Shawa







Amjad Al-Shawa, a prominent civil society leader in Gaza, has been reportedly chosen to head a new technocratic board that will govern the Gaza Strip, according to announcements by both Hamas and the Palestinian Authority on Sunday.Reports suggest that Hamas helped form the new administration, selecting about half of its members, while the Palestinian Authority chose the rest.A senior Hamas official, Mohammed Nazzal, told Reuters that the group will keep control of security in Gaza for now and cannot commit to giving up its weapons.Al-Shawa is considered a “comfortable” choice for Hamas, having maintained a neutral stance toward the movement over the years without publicly challenging or criticizing it, as cited by KAN News.Al-Shawa, born in Gaza in 1971, is recognized as a prominent humanitarian and rights activist in Palestine.He currently serves as Deputy Commissioner-General of the Independent Commission for Human Rights (Ombudsman) and as General Director of the Palestinian NGOs Network in Gaza.Al-Shawa is recognized for his efforts in defending human rights and supporting civil society.Observers say his extensive connections with international and humanitarian organizations make him a consensus candidate to oversee Gaza’s transitional phase with local and international cooperation, as cited by Sada News.Al-Shawar was also active in the international campaign to lift Gaza’s blockade after 2007, and contributed to efforts to end political divisions and uphold public freedoms.He also played a key role in mediating between official bodies in Gaza and the West Bank on critical issues such as healthcare, electricity, and medical supplies.","Amjad Al-Shawa, a prominent civil society leader in Gaza, has been reportedly chosen to head a new technocratic board that will govern the Gaza Strip.

Children at grave risk in Libya's camps



Over 3,500 minors reported dead or missing



Trump's USAID cuts have dramatic consequences



German government cuts funding for sea rescue







""No one would risk their life at sea if there were a better way. But there's no alternative. That's why we risk our lives.""These are the words of a 15-year-old boy from Guinea rescued as an unaccompanied minor at sea by the Berlin-based NGO, SOS Humanity.The organisation, which has been saving refugees and migrants at sea for the last decade, warns that more and more children and minors are setting out alone from Libya or Tunisia to Europe in overcrowded boats that are often not seaworthy. Around a fifth of those rescued have been minors.Esther, a German clinical psychologist, volunteered as a mental health officer on Mediterranean rescue missions in November and December 2024.During a press conference in Berlin on Tuesday, where Esther did not give her surname, she said that during her time at sea six boats carrying 347 people were rescued. Among them were 43 young people, mostly unaccompanied minors, in poor physical and mental health.""They'd often been at sea without food or drink for several days and nights, were dehydrated, seasick and often had burns from fuel and salt water. Many also had scabies or other infections and wounds, because they had been held in camps in Libya for long periods.All of them were emotionally exhausted,"" she said.Conditions in Libyan detention camps, where those intercepted by the the country's coast guard are returned after failed attempts to cross the Mediterranean, are catastrophic, especially for young people.For years, Libya: which, under a multimillion-euro agreement with the European Union , is meant to take over border control and drastically reduce migrant numbers, has faced intense criticism for serious human rights violations.""Young people told me about extreme sexual violence, torture, child labor, losing relatives and cases of human trafficking involving women,"" Esther recounted. ""Some of these young people showed me physical evidence of what they've been through. Some had scars from torture, as well as photos and videos taken at the Libyan camps showing them tied up and beaten.""Minors who manage to escape from the camps face even greater danger during the crossing.According to Unicef estimates from April, around 3,500 children have died or disappeared in the last 10 years while attempting to reach Italy via the central Mediterranean route. That means nearly one dead or missing child per day for an entire decade.This statistic has SOS Humanity calling for an immediate end to the EU's cooperation with Libya and Tunisia.""The proportion of minors among those fleeing has actually been rising steadily over the last 10 years. Around one-fifth of all arrivals in Italy are minors. In our rescues, the average is even more than one-third,"" said Till Rummenhohl, managing director of SOS Humanity.""We recently had a whole boat of just minors, 120, on board. They were completely panicked young people who were traveling alone and jumped into the water out of fear of the Libyan coast guard,"" he added.The growing number of children and adolescents embarking on the dangerous journey to Europe may worsen in the future, warned Lanna Idriss, the head of SOS Children's Villages Worldwide. The reason: the US government under President Donald Trump has dissolved the development aid agency USAID, with dramatic consequences.In a study published this summer, the medical journal The Lancet calculated that USAID cuts could result in more than 14 million deaths globally over the next five years, including up to 5 million children under the age of 5. Germany has also cut its development aid by almost €1 billion ($1.2 billion).""We are entering a vicious cycle that will lead to more children taking this route,"" said Idriss, citing Somalia as an example. ""The country was 80% dependent on USAID. Last year, we reached 4.5 million children and adolescents in Somalia; this year, only 1.3 million. Why? Because the camps intended to support these children have been empty since the summer.""Vera Magali Keller heads a law firm in Berlin that specialises in supporting humanitarian organisations, including those that carry out sea rescues.Children and young people must be given priority protection and evacuation during sea rescues, the lawyer told DW, referring to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which all UN member states have committed themselves.""In several European countries, there are special prospects for obtaining residence, protection entitlements and rights to family reunification. In Italy, for example, these often apply until the age of legal adulthood. As a general rule, children and adolescents must be accommodated separately from adults and given special protection. Detention should be avoided wherever possible,"" said Keller.SOS Humanity has announced plans to deploy another rescue vessel in the Mediterranean in 2026. The ship will primarily operate off the coast of Tunisia, searching for migrant boats and monitoring human rights violations.To do this, the sea rescue organisation will rely on donations, as the German government has discontinued its annual €2 million funding for civilian sea rescue. This is one reason why Keller is pessimistic about the future.""Given the current political and legal developments, I don't see any positive prospects,"" she said. ""I fear that the criminalisation and repression of civilian sea rescue will intensify under the current coalition. The already disastrous protection and reception standards for refugees in Europe will likely continue to deteriorate.""","More and more children and minors are setting out alone from Libya or Tunisia to Europe in overcrowded boats that are often not seaworthy. Around a fifth of those rescued have been minors. Unicef estimates around 3,500 children have died or disappeared in the last 10 years while attempting to reach Italy via the central Mediterranean route.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124839916,imgsize-1387983,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

Milei's moment of truth



US bailout on the line







Argentines have voted in legislative elections viewed as a litmus test for President Javier Milei's free-market reforms and deep austerity measures.Turnout was 66%, according to provisional figures released by the national election chamber. If confirmed, this would be the lowest turnout in more than 40 years, according to Spain's EFE news agency.The president and his party, La Libertad Avanza, is looking to increase its small minority in congress which would make future reforms easier.Half of Argentina's lower chambers of deputies and a third of the Senate's seats are up for grabs in this legislative elections.Melei has faced several political blows since September with congress overturning laws introduced by him.The high-stakes midterm elections assume even more importance for Argentina's economy.US President Donald Trump , who recently provided Argentina with a hefty financial bailout, has threatened to pull support if Milei does not perform well in the elections.""Don't give up because we're halfway there,"" Milei told supporters at a closing campaign event in the port city of Rosario on Thursday. ""We're on a good path.""Milei, who has built his presidency on austerity measures and drastic economic reforms, saw his popularity drop amid a corruption scandal and public weariness.While his reforms have tamed inflation, the dramatic welfare cuts have severely affected universities, public hospitals and pensioners.His party was defeated at the polls in Buenos Aires' provincial elections in September as a result, an outcome which was seen as indicative of the mood going into Sunday's ballot.A majority seems out of Milei's reach. However, political experts say that if the president's party grabs more than 35% of the votes, his government would be able to block opposition to his vetos through alliances with other parties.Sunday's outcome will be closely watched by the White House.Facing pressure from the Peso, which continues to lose ground, and inflation which is creeping back up, Milei sought help from one of his best political friends: US President Donald Trump.Trump, who has called Milei his ""favourite president,"" offered a financial package in the form of a currency swap worth $20 billion (€17.2 billion) and the promise of another $20 billion in aid from private banks.But soon after, Trump imposed a condition that Milei must not suffer defeat at the hands of ""socialists or communists.""","Half of Argentina's lower chambers of deputies and a third of the Senate's seats are up for grabs in legislative elections.

What to expect in Trump-Xi meeting

US-China ties





US President Donald Trump will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping on October 30, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in South Korea, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Thursday, reaffirming the meeting that had been questioned following an escalation in trade tensions.Leavitt informed reporters that Trump departs for Malaysia late on Friday night and will also visit Japan and South Korea. In South Korea, he is scheduled to meet Xi next Thursday after addressing the APEC CEO Summit.""On Thursday morning local time, President Trump will participate in a bilateral meeting with President Xi of the People's Republic of China, before departing to return home,"" Leavitt said.Trump on Thursday (local time) took a tough stance on China's alleged role in smuggling fentanyl into the US via Venezuela.He accused China of using Venezuela as a transit point for fentanyl, evading US and Mexican port controls. Trump, during a press interaction at the White House, stated that the first question he would ask the Chinese leader would be about fentanyl.""I'm meeting with President Xi... The first question I'm going to be asking him about is fentanyl. They make $100 million selling fentanyl into our country. They lose $100 billion with the 20% tariff.So it's not a good business proposition... It's one of the things we're talking about... They pay a very big penalty for doing that... We'll see what happens at the end of next week... I'm meeting with President Xi, actually, in South Korea. ..,"" said Trump.There is a lot at stake, so pressure is building on both leaders Trump and Xi to calm trade tensions that risk damaging the world’s two biggest economies.In this meeting, Trump is expected to crack a deal with Xi as he recently offered to lower tariffs on Chinese exports to the US but insisted that Beijing, too, had to make concessions, including resuming purchases of US soya beans, curbing the flow of ingredients used to make the opioid fentanyl – which has caused an overdose epidemic in America – and lifting restrictions on the export to the US of rare earth minerals, which are needed to manufacture hi-tech products such as smartphones, Guardian reported.Rare-earth stocks continue to be at the top of investors’ minds as the market weighs potential outcomes of a meeting between the leaders of the world’s two largest economies.A failure to reduce trade tensions could further harm US industries that are already grappling with the impact of Trump’s tariffs.The President was optimistic ahead of his meeting with Xi, telling reporters this week: “I think we’re going to end up having a fantastic deal with China … it’s going to be fantastic for the entire world”.Time is of the essence, however, as Trump and Xi’s meeting, yet to be confirmed by Beijing, is scheduled to occur just as additional duties of 100% on Chinese exports to the US are set to take effect.The leaders are also expected to discuss Taiwan, amid concerns that Trump might hesitate in Washington’s support for the democratic, self-governing island under pressure from Xi.Beijing has reportedly requested the White House to declare opposition to Taiwan independence – a move that would please China, which considers Taiwan a renegade province that must be reunified with the mainland.Trade tensions between the United States and China intensified in recent weeks following President Trump's announcement of 100 per cent tariffs on Chinese exports, set to take effect two days after the leaders meet.Trump's pledge followed China's announcement of newly imposed export controls on rare earth metals and related technologies in electronics and military goods.The new US tariffs would be “over and above any tariff” that China is already paying, Trump wrote in a social media post earlier this month. Trump added on Wednesday that his priority is to end Russia's war in Ukraine.Xi “would now like to see that war end,” the president said. It will be the first in-person meeting between the leaders since 2019, when the two met in Japan at the G20 summit, as per Politico.","US President Donald Trump will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping on October 30, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in South Korea.

FBI's Kash Patel Announces BIG Arrests: NBA Gambling Ring Bust, Terry Rozier, Billups Arrested





US president Donald Trump on Sunday alleged that Democrats cheated in the 2020 elections and repeated the claim that they were “rigged and stolen”. He compared the alleged “cheating” to reports of NBA players cheating at cards, calling the election issue a “far bigger scandal.”""What’s worse, the NBA Players cheating at cards, and probably much else, or the Democrats cheating on Elections. The 2020 Presidential Election, being Rigged and Stolen, is a far bigger SCANDAL,"" Trump said through a post on Truth Social.Trump was referring to a major basketball scandal in which federal indictments alleged that current and former NBA players, including a Hall of Fame coach, were connected to Mafia-linked gambling rings.He said the country suffered under President Joe Biden , whom he referred to as a “crooked moron,” and urged the Department of Justice to investigate the 2020 election.Trump warned that similar issues could occur during future elections, including the upcoming midterms, if stricter voting measures were not implemented. He reiterated his opposition to mail-in and early voting and called for mandatory voter identification.""I hope the DOJ pursues this with as much “gusto” as befitting the biggest SCANDAL in American history! If not, it will happen again, including the upcoming Midterms. No mail-in or “Early” Voting, Yes to Voter ID!"" Trump said.The US president further claimed that voting on California’s Proposition 50 is “totally dishonest,” alleging that “millions of ballots” are being “shipped” into the state.Proposition 50, also known as the Election Rigging Response Act, seeks to amend the California Constitution and pause the work of the state’s independent redistricting commission until 2031. The measure would allow Democrats to redraw district boundaries, potentially creating five additional safe seats.Earlier this year, Trump signed an executive order aimed at making broad changes to how elections are conducted, even though the Constitution grants that authority primarily to individual states. Portions of the order have since been blocked by the courts.The Justice Department is currently requesting US states to provide voter information, including sensitive personal data such as partial Social Security numbers, as part of its effort to investigate potential cases of voter fraud, as cited by CNN.","US president Donald Trump on Sunday alleged that Democrats cheated in the 2020 elections.

'Mystery' Patriot Or...? Decoding The SHOCK $130Mn Gift To Pay Troops Amid Shutdown





Timothy Mellon, a reclusive billionaire and a major financial backer of President Trump, is the anonymous private donor who gave $130 million to the US govt to help pay troops during the shutdown, according to two people familiar with the matter.Trump announced the donation Thursday, but he declined to identify the person who provided the funds, only calling him a ""patriot"" and a friend. But the two people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the donation was private, identified him as Mellon.Shortly after departing Washington on Friday, Trump again declined to identify Mellon while talking to reporters aboard Air Force One. He only said the individual was ""a great American citizen"" and a ""substantial man."" ""He doesn't want publicity,"" Trump said as he headed to Malaysia. The White House declined to comment. Multiple attempts to reach Mellon and representatives for him were unsuccessful.It remains unclear how far the donation will go toward covering the salaries of the more than 1.3 million troops who make up the active-duty military. The Trump administration's 2025 budget requested about $600 billion in total military compensation; a $130 million donation would equal about $100 a service member.Mellon, a wealthy banking heir and railroad magnate, is a longtime backer of Trump and gave tens of millions of dollars to groups supporting the president's campaign.Last year, he made a $50 million donation to a super political action committee supporting Trump, which was one of the largest single contributions ever disclosed.A grandson of former treasury secretary Andrew W. Mellon, Mellon was not a prominent Republican donor until Trump was elected.

Australia Blasts China After Su-35 Intercept Sparks Tensions In South China Sea





A US Navy helicopter and a fighter jet crashed separately during routine operations over the South China Sea on Sunday, with no fatalities reported. The incidents coincided with US President Donald Trump’s visit to the region for the Asean Summit in Kuala Lumpur.According to the US Navy’s Pacific Fleet, the first crash involved an MH-60R Sea Hawk helicopter that “went down in the waters of South China Sea while conducting routine operations from the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz.” All three crew members aboard were rescued by search and rescue teams, the statement said.Roughly 30 minutes later, a Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornet fighter jet also crashed into the South China Sea “while conducting routine operations” from the same carrier. Both crew members successfully ejected and were safely recovered, the US navy confirmed.The US navy said on social media Sunday evening that the MH-60R Seahawk, assigned to the “Battle Cats” of Helicopter Maritime Strike Squadron (HSM) 73, went down around 2:45pm local time. “Search-and-rescue crews rescued three crew members,” the statement said.At 3:15pm, an F/A-18F Super Hornet assigned to the “Fighting Redcocks” of Strike Fighter Squadron (VFA) 22 also went down while conducting routine operations from the USS Nimitz.“All personnel involved are safe and in stable condition,” the US navy said. “The cause of both incidents is currently under investigation.”The crashes took place as US President Trump embarked on a diplomatic tour across Asia, where he is scheduled to meet Chinese leader Xi Jinping for discussions centered on trade. Relations between Washington and Beijing have been tense in recent weeks after both sides imposed new economic measures on each other.These incidents follow the loss of two Super Hornet jets in the Red Sea earlier this spring. Each F/A-18 fighter jet costs over $60 million, according to the Navy. CNN reported that the USS Nimitz -- among the world’s largest warships -- is the oldest US aircraft carrier in service and is set for retirement next year.Earlier this year, two US warplanes also fell off the USS Harry S Truman aircraft carrier while operating in the Middle East.",A US Navy helicopter and a fighter jet crashed separately during routine operations over the South China Sea on Sunday.

The recent romantic connection between former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and pop star Katy Perry is taking the internet by storm. Beyond their personal lives, this relationship raises intriguing questions about the intersection of celebrity culture and political branding.Trudeau is often dubbed the ""first prime minister of the Instagram age,"" and has adeptly utilized social media to craft a relatable and progressive image, according to the Guardian. His strategic use of platforms like Instagram has allowed him to connect with younger audiences. Values such as inclusivity and environmental consciousness are no strangers to him. This approach has been instrumental in shaping his political persona and public perception.Perry is known for her outspoken political stances and activism, and has similarly leveraged her celebrity status to influence public discourse, according to the Varierty. Her support for various social causes and political figures has demonstrated the power of celebrity endorsements in shaping political narratives. She backed Hillary Clinton for US president in 2016 even though she lost.The convergence of Trudeau's political brand and Perry's celebrity influence could potentially create a dynamic synergy.Their shared values and public personas might amplify messages related to social justice, environmental sustainability, and progressive governance. Such a partnership could resonate with younger demographics, further solidifying their influence in both political and cultural spheres.However, this blending of celebrity and politics is not without its challenges. Critics argue that the fusion of entertainment and political messaging can dilute substantive policy discussions.

Who is Sami Hamdi? Muslim journalist detained by ICE at San Francisco Airport,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-sami-hamdi-muslim-journalist-detained-by-ice-at-san-francisco-airport/articleshow/124834793.cms,"Why was Hamdi detained?







A British Muslim journalist and political commentator, Sami Hamdi, was detained by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents at San Francisco International Airport on Sunday morning, officials said.His visa was revoked, and he remains in ICE custody, according to Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).“Under President Trump, those who support terrorism and undermine American national security will not be allowed to work or visit this country,” McLaughlin wrote on X. She also praised Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Secretary of State Marco Rubio for Hamdi’s removal, calling it “It’s common sense.”Hamdi is a journalist and political commentator, serving as the Editor-in-Chief of The International Interest, a magazine that covers Middle Eastern, Far Eastern, and UK politics. He has also contributed articles to Al Jazeera in 2022.The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) condemned the detention, calling it an “injustice.” “Earlier this morning, ICE agents abducted British Muslim journalist and political commentator Sami Hamdi at San Francisco Airport, apparently in response to his vocal criticism of the Israeli government during his ongoing speaking tour,” CAIR said.“We can confirm that Mr. Hamdi has not been deported and remains in custody. Our attorneys and partners are working to address this injustice.”CAIR further condemned the arrest as an attack on free speech, according to Kron4 News. “Everyone should recognise that arresting a British citizen legally visiting the United States because he dared to criticise a foreign nation’s genocide is our government’s latest blatant affront to free speech,” the organisation said. “Our nation must stop abducting critics of the Israeli government at the behest of unhinged Israel-first bigots; this is an Israel-first policy, not an America-first policy, and it must end. ”According to RAIR Foundation USA, Hamdi has repeatedly praised attacks carried out by Hamas, including the October 7, 2023 massacre in which over 1,200 civilians were killed. He described the hostage-taking and killings as “victorious” and “merciful,” and publicly glorified the operation, reposting videos of victims. DHS officials said that such actions qualify as espousing terrorist activity and demonstrated a clear alignment with a US-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization.Beyond his public statements, Hamdi has participated in international training programs linked to the Muslim Brotherhood, a network identified by US authorities as cultivating operatives for political and ideological influence abroad. While in the United States, he reportedly instructed audiences to destabilise support for US allies, target officials, and weaponise elections. ICE cited these activities as evidence that Hamdi was using US soil to further extremist agendas, radicalise audiences, and operate as an embedded actor for a foreign network hostile to American interests.","Sami Hamdi was detained by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents at San Francisco International Airport on Sunday morning.

Donald Trump wants a 'Golden Fleet' to fight China because he hates 'ugly ships': Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-wants-a-golden-fleet-to-fight-china-because-he-hates-ugly-ships-report/articleshow/124832509.cms,"Trump's HUGE Russia Oil Reveal Before MEETING XI JINPING; 'Like India, China Too...' | ASEAN Summit

'Really long-range missiles '





Why not an 'ugly ship'?





Is Trump's 'aesthetic eye' important?









US President Donald Trump is reportedly pushing for a new armada of US Navy warships, dubbed the “Golden Fleet,” to counter what he sees as an increasing threat from China, as reported by the Wall Street JournalThe plans come as Trump prepares for a high-stakes meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping during his first visit to Asia since assuming office in January this year.According to the report, Trump and senior officials are discussing a fleet of advanced warships equipped with long-range missiles. “This battleship of tomorrow is going to be this thing that carries really long-range missiles,” Bryan Clark, a retired Navy officer and senior fellow at the Hudson Institute involved in the discussions, told the outlet.The Pentagon and the White House are also reportedly exploring plans for a new 15,000 to 20,000-ton ship that would be heavily armoured and could potentially carry hypersonic missiles. White House spokesperson Anna Kelly hinted at a forthcoming announcement, saying, “Stay tuned!” while praising Trump’s efforts to “bolster America’s maritime dominance.”Trump has long voiced opinions on the appearance of US Navy vessels. Former Secretary of Defense Mark Esper recalled telling Trump that warships “are built to fight and win, not win beauty contests.” At a recent summit in Virginia, Trump admitted he was “not a fan” of some ships.“They say, ‘Oh, it's stealth.’ I said, ‘That's not stealth.’ An ugly ship is not necessary in order to say you're stealth,” he said.Navy secretary John Phelan also revealed that Trump frequently texted him late at night about the state of ships, sometimes after 1 am, asking what was being done about rusty vessels or those in the yard.Not everyone agrees with the new fleet plans. Retired naval officer Mark Montgomery, a senior fellow with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told the WSJ that the administration should focus on fixing the existing backlog of ship maintenance. “The president’s aesthetic eye is not the proper paradigm to evaluate tactical ship requirements,” he said.The proposal follows earlier controversies in the Navy, including a directive by defence secretary Pete Hegseth to rename the replenishment oiler USNS Harvey Milk, named after the gay rights icon and Navy veteran.

Row erupts over Melania Trump’s silence on White House demolition: ‘Doesn’t care about history...’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/row-erupts-over-melania-trumps-silence-on-white-house-demolition-doesnt-care-about-history-/articleshow/124830672.cms,"



As bulldozers tear down the East Wing of the White House to make way for President Donald Trump’s multi-million dollar ballroom, one voice has been notably missing from the debate — that of first lady Melania Trump.The East Wing was once the headquarters of first ladies since the Carter era. The demolition has upended her office space and disrupted public tours, yet Melania has not publicly commented on the matter.Her office declined to respond when asked by CNN whether she supports the project, despite the outcry from former East Wing staffers of both parties. Crews began work this week on the president’s long-promised gilded ballroom, which critics, mostly Democratic, have called an unnecessary vanity project.Melania spends most of her time in New York and Palm Beach. She rarely visits Washington and keeps a small staff of just five full-time members. These aides have been temporarily relocated to rooms within the executive mansion.The White House has not confirmed whether the ballroom’s design will include permanent office space for the first lady.According to experts, the lack of communication shows her increasingly distant role during her husband’s second term.Kate Andersen Brower, author of First Women, which explores the influence of presidential spouses, said: “Watching the demolition is the physical embodiment of watching the first lady’s role become smaller and smaller. She’s making it clear that – like her husband – she’s not going to be like any other first lady. … She doesn’t care about historic precedent, either.”“Since Monday, I have heard from alumni of the East Wing from multiple administrations who are understandably stunned by the images,” said Anita McBride, former chief of staff to First Lady Laura Bush. “First ladies’ staff lived and witnessed history within those walls and nothing can take away the memories of working in that extraordinarily special place of purpose and service.”Observers have compared Melania’s silence to a neighbour ignoring the demolition of her own garage.“It would be like — you’re really close to your next door neighbour, but they decided to demolish your garage for a basketball court, and you didn’t really say anything about it,” said journalist Kate Bennett, author of Free, Melania.During her first term, Melania was an active steward of White House preservation, overseeing furniture restorations and the Rose Garden redesign. But this time, she has largely stepped back, leaving her husband to take charge of renovations.The East Wing has long been a symbol of the first lady’s influence. Built in 1902 and expanded in 1942, it became the official home of the Office of the first lady under Rosalynn Carter in 1977. For decades, it served as both a working space and the main entrance for state dinners and receptions.","The East Wing was once the headquarters of first ladies since the Carter era.

Did Canada PM mock Trump in Malaysia?

Trump Alleges UN Sabotage After Teleprompter & Escalator Fail During Malaysia Visit, Crowd in Shock





Canada Prime Minister Mark Carney did a 'Trump' in Malaysia as he, on camera, confused 'premier' and 'president' and called Ontario Premier Doug Ford the President -- the way Donald Trump confuses the post of Canada's topmost leader and calls them 'president', 'governor' etc. Carney flew to Kuala Lumpur to address the ASEAN summit just after Donald Trump dropped the bombshell, ending trade talks with Canada and then raised tariffs on Canadian goods. Trump is angry that Canada is trying to influence Americans that Ronald Reagan, the much-loved Republican president, was against tariffs, as Canada launched an advertisement which was extensively broadcast on US networks.The advertisement was launched by Ontario Premier Doug Ford, a Conservative leader, who is now being accused of sabotaging the US-Canada trade talks. Ford and Carney, despite their political differences, claimed to be on the same page on trade with the US. Ford said the ad would be withdrawn.In Malaysia, Carney unleashed his playful side as he called Premier Ford 'a good friend' the same way Trump refers to world leaders. ""Did I say good friend Premier Ford?"" Mark Carney said with a smile and then went on to refer to Ford as 'President Ford', only to correct himself with a defence that he always confuses between Premier and President.'God! Sorry, I don't know why I mix the two up -- President and Premier Ford,"" he said.Recently, Trump called Carney the President instead of Prime Minister and when Carney corrected Trump, Trump defended that at least he did not call Carney a Governor. Carney's predecessor Justin Trudeau had to resign earlier this year under growing pressure from the party as he became a laughing stock for Trump who invited Canada to join the US as the 51st state with Trudeau being the Governor.","Mark Carney says he confuses between 'Premier' and 'President' and ends up calling Doug Ford the president.

What Bollaro’s defence said







When food cravings overcame essential responsibilities, a cop evidently went to satisfy them, ending in fatal tragedy.A New Jersey police sergeant was charged with official misconduct and tampering with records after allegedly ignoring multiple 911 calls about a shooting and instead driving to get a pizza and chit-chat, prosecutors said.Franklin Township police sergeant Kevin Bollaro faces up to 10 years in prison and a $150,000 fine over his response to the deaths of 29-year-old Tyler Webb and his girlfriend, 33-year-old Lauren Semanchik, on August 1, reports the Daily Mail.45-year-old New Jersey State Police Lieutenant Ricardo Santos and Semanchik's ex-boyfriend was confirmed as the murderer. Santos was later found roughly an hour away with a self-inflicted gunshot wound.Angela Webb, Tyler’s sister, called for the maximum penalty for Bollaro, writing on Facebook she hoped he ""serves all 10 years and thinks about this every single day.""Prosecutors say Bollaro knew about the first 911 call reporting gunshots and screaming around 7pm, but he drove away to withdraw money from a bank instead of going to the scene. Even after getting more calls from dispatch about worried neighbours, he only spent a few minutes at the first location and did not talk to the second or third callers.GPS data also showed he did not check the area where he could have found Semanchik’s home.Bollaro is also accused of driving to Duke’s Pizzeria & Restaurant, where he remained for 50 minutes, and then to the Pittstown Inn, where he stayed for nearly an hour, engaging socially with patrons. He later spent five hours at Locust Grover Cemetery, despite no criminal activity being reported there.Tyler Webb and Lauren Semanchik were found by police officers on August 2 after a call reported an unconscious woman with apparent physical trauma. Investigators said Santos had been stalking and harassing Semanchik prior to the shooting. Her father discovered her inside their home the day after the 911 calls.Bollaro’s attorney, Charles Sciarra, defended his client, saying, ""Nothing Kevin Bollaro did or did not do that day impacted or could have stopped that tragedy in any way. Sgt. Kevin Bollaro has faithfully served that community for nearly 25 years [and] is not guilty of anything related to this horrendous killing.
