Hubby's girlfriend can't be charged in DV case: HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hubbys-girlfriend-cant-be-charged-in-dv-case-hc/articleshow/112695783.cms,"NAGPUR: Bombay high court 's Nagpur bench recently held that a husband's girlfriend cannot be considered a ""relative"" under domestic violence laws , thereby exempting her from being charged under Section 498A of IPC.The court's decision in response to a petition by a woman accused of having an extramarital affair set a precedent in interpretation of domestic violence statutes.Section 498A makes it a criminal offence for a husband or his relatives to subject a married woman to cruelty or harassment, with penalties, including imprisonment of up to three years and a fine.""As the petitioner woman is not the relative of the husband, Section 498A shall not be invoked. The chargesheet is filed against her only because allegations are made that the complainant woman's husband is having an extramarital affair with her. As per law, the chargesheet is illegal,"" a division bench comprising Justices Vibha Kankanwadi and Vrushali Joshi said. The case involved a resident of Chandrapur in Maharashtra and employed with an educational institution. She was accused of having an extramarital affair with the complainant's husband. Police charged her, along with the husband and his family, under Section 498A.The petitioner argued Section 498A could only apply to the husband and his relatives, not to a third party involved in an extramarital affair. The woman contended she was charged due to a personal grudge as she was close to the complainant's husband.According to experts, the judgment provides clarity on the scope of domestic violence laws and reinforces the principle of not expanding the statutory definition of ""relative"" beyond its intended meaning. As extramarital affairs are sensitive and complex, the HC ruling is likely to have a considerable impact on the way such cases are approached and adjudicatedin the future. Earlier, the SC had said Section 498A should not be automatically applied in every case of domestic violence, holding that a single instance of inappropriate behaviour does not constitute harassment or cruelty."," Bombay high court's Nagpur bench recently held that a husband's girlfriend cannot be considered a ""relative"" under domestic violence laws.

ABVP protests use of Pakistan flag in pre-school play,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/abvp-protests-use-of-pakistan-flag-in-pre-school-play/articleshow/112695463.cms,"INDORE: The display of a Pakistan flag by pre-schoolers in a play has triggered protests by right-wing groups in MP’s Ratlam. The Pakistan flag was used as a prop in the play, just as Britain’s flag was, since it was based on India’s freedom struggle and Partition.But ABVP , BJP’s student wing, protested against it and staged a demonstration in front of the Ratlam collectorate on Wednesday and blocked the Mhow-Neemuch Road for an hour, demanding action against the school.The school says an edited clip of the video was posted by someone on social media, giving a wrong picture. “I have received information about this incident. The matter has been passed on to local police for investigation.We have not initiated any action through the education department,” Ratlam collector Rajesh Batham told TOI. “Preschools do not have any affiliation or recognition from the education department. Thus, we have not initiated any action in this regard,” Ratlam DEO in charge Ashok Lodha said. The skit was part of a cultural programme held at the preschool on Independence Day.A seven-minute video of the play was shared on the school’s social media page the following day. It starts with the children celebrating Indian culture and diversity, showing people of different religions living in harmony.Towards the end, most of the kids are seen holding up the Tricolour and a lone child is seen with the Pakistan flag as the narrator describes the Partition. As soon as the scene is over, the Pakistan flag is taken off stage. However, the video soon sparked outrage on social media. The school management said the video was misinterpreted. “The play was intended to educate the children about India’s struggle for Independence, including Partition. The Pakistani flag was used as part of a historical scene.The scene depicting Partition required the presence of both the flags. Someone cropped that portion from the original video and shared it on social media, and this led to a misinterpretation,” Deepak Panth, dir","The Pakistan flag was used as a prop in the play, just as Britain’s flag was, since it was based on India's freedom struggle and Partition.

Local train movement has been affected as protests are underway at Badlapur Station. Police have arrested a person in the case. The parents came to know about the incident on August 18 and filed anFIR .Two four-year-old nursery students were allegedly sexually abused by a newly hired sweeper at an English medium school in Thane district. The 24-year-old accused was arrested on Saturday, but the parents of the victims expressed their dissatisfaction with the police's handling of the case. They claimed that the FIR was registered more than 12 hours after the complaint was lodged, and only after the intervention of the District Women and Child Welfare Department.The school administration on Monday suspended the principal, class teacher , and female attendant, holding them responsible for the incident.The school administration has also come under scrutiny for allowing a male sweeper, who was hired on August 1, to accompany the young girls to the washroom. The incident came to light when one of the girls confided in her grandfather about the sexual abuse by the school staff member when he would take her and her friend to the washroom. The family then discussed the matter with the other girl's parents, who revealed that their daughter had recently become afraid to go to school.The families took the four-year-olds for a medical check-up with a private doctor, who confirmed that the girls had been sexually abused. They then approached a local MNS leader who accompanied them to the police station on Friday at 12.30 pm. However, instead of promptly recording the parents' statements and registering an FIR, the police station in-charge, Shubhada Shitole, allegedly made them wait for hours, stating that they needed to verify the claim first. Sources claimed that a police team visited the school but were informed that the CCTV cameras had not been functioning for the past few days.It was only after the District Women and Child Welfare Department intervened, police registered a case under the Pocso Act past midnight. On Saturday morning, police also got the girls’ medical examination conducted at a govt hospital as a private medical test is not valid in court.The police station incharge, Subhada Shitole, has been transferred to the special branch by Thane police for delaying the registration of the FIR when the parents of the child approached the police station.Locals said that along with citizens, rickshaw union, traders’ union, jewellers association, and now some political parties have also come forward to join the bandh. The accused, who was hired by the school on August 1, will remain in police remand until August 21.Rajya Sabha MP from UBT Sena, Priyanka Chaturvedi expressed her deep concern and condemned the incident.""Two young girls were sexually assaulted in Badlapur, Maharashtra in the school premises; the entire state is outraged and seeks justice. I once again urge the President to approve the Maharashtra Shakti Criminal Law, so that no other child or woman faces this travesty. Shame on the state government to continue to ignore the safety of women,"" she posted on X.Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray demanded a fast-track trial and speedy justice in the case of sexual abuse of two girls at a school in Thane district. Talking to reporters, Thackeray said on one hand, the Mahayuti government is running the Mukhyamantri Ladki Bahin scheme for women, but daughters of sisters are not safe.In an apparent reference to the rape and murder of a doctor in Kolkata, where the Mamata Banerjee-led government has come under fire, the Sena (UBT) chief said politics was being done over crime against women by targeting certain states.The former chief minister claimed the school where the girls were allegedly sexually abused was linked to BJP leaders. ""The case should be fast-tracked, and the victims should be ensured speedy justice,"" he said.Leaders of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) parties like Congress, Nationalist Congress Party (SP) and Shiv Sena (UBT), besides Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, attacked the government on the incident in the home district of chief minister Eknath Shinde.Nationalist Congress Party (SP) working president Supriya Sule said the incident is “very shocking and serious” and the state home department must take note of the citizens’ anger.“Citizens are demanding strict action against the murderer who committed this heinous act. The anger of the citizens is very right and the home department needs to take note of their anger,” urged Sule.She called upon the Thane Police to thoroughly investigate the (accused) person and take strict action against him.“Apart from this, a case should also be registered against the management of the institution who tried to suppress this matter,” demanded Sule.Congress leader of the opposition in the assembly, Vijay Wadettiwar called up Thane Police Commissioner Ashutosh Dumbare and demanded the suspension of the woman police official who reportedly made the victim’s parents sit in the police station for nearly 12 hours before taking their complaint last week.“This case must be taken up by a fast track court to hear it in three months and the accused must be given the death sentence,” said Wadettiwar.Congress MP and Mumbai president Varsha Gaikwad said, “The incident of inhumane and cruel treatment of the girls is mind-numbing”, and the issue of women’s safety has become very serious during the Shinde government, while its silence was unbearable.“The number of crimes against women is also increasing, but the state Home Minister and the government are not at all concerned. It is not enough to simply say 'Ladaki Baheen' and sit with rakhi in hand. If the government wants to preserve the true relationship with the sisters, it also has to fulfil the responsibility of keeping them safe as a true brother,” pointed out Gaikwad.SS (UBT)’s Deputy Leader Sushma Andhare questioned why schools without CCTVs and ‘sevikas’ (women assistants) were given permission and said “Ladki Bahin can wait, we need ‘Surakshit Bahin’ (secure sister) first”.Claiming that there is a complete collapse of law and order in the state, SS (UBT)’s spokesperson Kishore Tiwari demanded the immediate sacking of deputy CM Fadnavis and forming an SIT to probe the shocking case.“The law and order does not exist due to corruption and cash deals to get desired police postings… The CM is like a rubber stamp as there's a complete collapse of law and order due to hostile corruption and cash and getting the desired posting. The BJP is responsible for the present messy situation,” said Tiwari.Demanding the resignation of both the CM and deputy CM, VBA Chief Spokesperson Siddharth Mokle said the incident is a blot on humanity but the government is only obsessed about winning the next elections at all costs.The Maharashtra government on Tuesday ordered the setting up of a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the alleged sexual abuse of two girl students of a school in Badlapur. The SIT will be headed by Inspector General of Police-rank officer Aarti Singh, deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, who heads the home department, stated on X.Fadnavis stated he has directed the Thane Police Commissioner to prepare a proposal to try the case in a fast-track court.Maharashtra government ordered the suspension of three police officials, including a senior inspector, for alleged dereliction of duty in the investigation of the sexual abuse of two girls at a school in Badlapur, amid widespread protests.""The orders of immediate suspension of the senior police inspector, assistant sub-inspector and head constable attached to Badlapur police station for the dereliction of duty have been issued,"" deputy chief minister and home minister Devendra Fadnavis posted on X.Fadnavis said the state government has appointed Arti Singh, an inspector general-rank Indian Police Service (IPS) officer, to conduct the inquiry.""It will be our endeavour to inquire into the incident at the earliest. We want to file the chargesheet in this case as soon as possible and place the matter before a fast-track court for hearing,"" he said.""Our police department will make complete efforts to get such a barbaric and inhuman act punished immediately,"" the deputy chief minister added.He slammed the Nationalist Congress Party's (NCP) working president, Supriya Sule, and former Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray for allegedly politicising the issue.""It is unfortunate that the opposition seeks to gain political benefit out of such incidents. The opposition is devoid of any empathy. The politics of the opposition is coming to the fore,"" the senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader said.He said Thackeray should behave like a statesman and not stoop too low and indulge in politics on a sensitive issue of sexual abuse.Meanwhile, Maharashtra chief minister Eknath Shinde has directed the police to invoke the attempt to rape charge against the arrested accused. The case will be fast-tracked and a special public prosecutor will be appointed, Shinde said on Tuesday.""I have spoken to the Thane Commissioner of Police. The accused has been arrested. I have asked the case to be fast-tracked and book the accused under the charges of attempt to rape and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act,"" he said.The chief minister warned of legal action if the management of the school is found negligent or complicit, the chief minister's office (CMO) stated.During a meeting with education minister Deepak Kesarkar, Shinde proposed several measures aimed at improving school safety and preventing future abuse like the installation of complaint boxes in every school, enhancing scrutiny of school staff who frequently interact with students, including the background checks, and establishing safe reporting mechanisms for students.Shinde appealed to demonstrating parents to exercise restraint as the rail blockade was hampering the functioning of local trains.Maharashtra education minister Deepak Kesarkar said, ""We will see to it that the existing safety measures are further strengthened. We are issuing a circular today that CCTVs must be operational in each school. We will appoint a committee based on the Vishaka committee in schools as well. We will fast-track this case and give the strictest punishment to the accused. The school principal, the class teacher and 2 assistants have been suspended. The school also has been served a notice. A woman senior PI who delayed registering a case has been transferred but she should be suspended.""""This is a very sad incident. The entire machinery of the state education department has been mobilized. We have given instructions to four IAS officers from Pune and Mumbai. We are investigating why the CCTV was not functioning in the school. After the complaint was lodged, no action was taken, so the Senior PI has been transferred. We will bring this case to a Fast Track court and ensure the maximum punishment for the accused. Our entire department is present here, and the safety of students is our priority,"" he added.Meanwhile, a BJP MLA from the Murbad assembly constituency in Thane district, Kisan Kathore, alleged the protest at Badlapur railway station is politically motivated. He claimed agitators have come from neighbouring areas and not from Badlapur.""These demonstrators are not from Badlapur city; they have arrived from neighbouring areas such as Ulhasnagar. A comprehensive investigation is conducted against the school principal and staff members who allegedly attempted to suppress the incident,"" Kathore said.He alleged some individuals associated with political parties had put up banners in Badlapur rejecting the funds offered under the ""Mukhyamantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana"", but are now seeking justice. ""The protesters at Badlapur station are not locals. They are residents of neighbouring areas,"" he added.The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) on Tuesday demanded a detailed report from Maharashtra authorities on the incident of alleged sexual assault on two four-year-old girls in a school washroom in Thane district and the ""delay"" in filing an FIR in the matter. The Commission took suo motu cognisance of the case on a day thousands of protesters blocked railway tracks at Badlapur station in Thane and stormed the local school building, where the alleged incident had occurred.The accused, who was employed to clean the girls' toilets, is alleged to have victimised the children on August 12-13, 2024.The NHRC has issued notices to the chief secretary and the Director General of Police of Maharashtra, demanding a detailed report on the incident within two weeks.The Commission's directive calls for clarity on the reasons behind the reported ""12-hour delay"" in registering the First Information Report (FIR) after the parents lodged a complaint with the police.Parents of the victims have raised concerns over why a female staff member was not assigned to clean the girls' washroom, a standard practice that could have potentially prevented such an incident.The Commission has emphasised the need to investigate this aspect thoroughly.In addition to the status of the FIR, the NHRC has requested details about the health and well-being of the two victims, including whether they have received any counselling or support services from the authorities or the school management.The NHRC has also asked for information on the measures being taken or proposed to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future.The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) will dispatch a team to Thane in Maharashtra following the alleged sexual assault of a four-year-old girl in a school in the district. The apex child rights body has also questioned the delay in the registration of an FIR in the matter. The incident has sparked outrage, particularly due to a reported delay by the local police in lodging the First Information Report (FIR).NCPCR Chairperson Priyank Kanoongo took to social media to express his distress over the incident and announced that a team would be dispatched to investigate the matter.He questioned why police made the victim's parents wait for 12 hours to get an FIR lodged.""I will personally monitor the investigation, and ensure that all negligent police officers are punished,"" Kanoongo said in a post on X.A woman journalist covering the protest over the Badlapur sexual abuse incident alleged on Tuesday that a local leader of the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena made an offensive remark, saying she was acting 'as if she herself had been raped.'Waman Mhatre, former mayor of Badlapur who belongs to the party led by the Maharashtra chief minister, however, claimed that his remark was misconstrued.The woman journalist, who works for a Marathi daily, told a news channel that as she was covering the protests on the tracks, Mhatre confronted her, making 'vulgar' gestures. She was reporting on the incident in such a way 'as if she herself had been raped,' she quoted Mhatre as saying.""Such behavior was highly unacceptable and caused me agony. However, I responded by asserting that my reporting is based on facts,"" the woman added.Mhatre claimed that his comments were misconstrued. ""I was insisting that they provide factual information to the protesters. The word 'rape' was consistently used. I was asking them to get factual information, but it was misconstrued,"" he said.The Mumbai Press Club condemned Mhatre's statements and demanded that chief minister Shinde take action against him. Mhatre ""demonstrated blatant disregard for public sentiment by blaming journalists for the incident"" and asserted that the media was inciting unrest, the Press Club said in a statement.","Two four-year-old nursery students were allegedly sexually abused by a newly hired sweeper at an English medium school in Thane district. Parents of the victims expressed their dissatisfaction with the police's handling of the case. Local train movement has been affected as protests are underway at Badlapur Station. The school administration on Monday suspended the principal, class teacher and female attendant.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112647326,imgsize-80076,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/112647326.jpg"
Villagers thwart bulldozers out to raze houses in south Delhi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/villagers-thwart-bulldozers-out-to-raze-houses-in-south-delhi/articleshow/112635348.cms,"The village has three clusters spread over 15 acres, with around 1,000 families living there, who claim to be the third and fourth generations of stone mine labourers

NEW DELHI: The festive mood of Raksha Bandhan petered out rapidly at Rajokri village near Vasant Kunj on Monday morning when bulldozers arrived to demolish the houses. But the residents thwarted the exercise, blocking the entry to the village with a truck. The residents' association is now busy pulling out old documents and doing the paperwork to get a stay on the demolitions from Delhi High Court .The village has three clusters spread over 15 acres, with around 1,000 families living amid old mining pits. The families claim to be the third and fourth generations of stone mine labourers who once worked there. They also claim to be living in the area for over three decades.Residents said forest officials, accompanied by police and power officials, reached the clusters of Ramdev Ka Dera, Chameli Ka Dera and Keval Krishna Ka Dera, named after the contractors who brought the to work the mines as far back as 1964, with bulldozers on Monday morning, an action they had been anticipating after receiving demolition notices on Aug 9 and 14. The locals, while asserting that they had the right to rehabilitation as per DUSIB norms , alleged that the forest department hadn't given them enough time to explore legal options.""After receiving the first notice at Ramdev Ka Dera on Aug 9, we have been apprehensive,"" said Rajendra Kumar, who works as a driver for a south Delhi family. ""I am the third generation of my family living here after my grandfather came as a labourer from Rajasthan in 1967. We have valid documents, power connection and water supply, yet are being thrown out.""The area also has a DUSIB community centre, proper roads, electric poles and piped water through two tubewells. Delhi Jal Board tankers also supply drinking water in the region because, the residents say, the groundwater is often undrinkable.After the stone mines closed, the hamlet was designated a gram sabha. However, in 1996, the area was declared forest land and part of the Ridge. In 2013, the Sonya Ghosh Vs GNCT Delhi case began and in Jan 2021, the National Green Tribunal directed Delhi govt to take measures to protect the Ridge, including clearance of encroached areas.""These clusters are among the oldest of the 675 slums enlisted under the DUSIB Act, 2010. Under that Act, houses built before 2006 can't be removed without the residents being rehabilitated,"" said activist Prakash Kumar. ""A rehab plan, a must under DUSIB norms, hasn't been prepared or shared with the Rajokri residents. So how can the forest department carry out demolitions?""Forest officials did not offer any comment on the matter. On Aug 8, the West forest division listed khasra numbers and asked the people occupying these plots to vacate them within seven days. The notice claimed the plots comprised notified reserve forest land and the houses were encroachments under the Indian Forest Act, 1927.""The forest department wants us to vacate this area but isn't interested in rehabilitating people who lose their homes,"" complained Tuntun Kumar, a union member who is in the team exploring legal options. ""They call us encroachers, which we are not. We have papers for the land; there are records that we paid for the land block.""Sher Singh, who traces his roots to Rajasthan, said, ""Our ancestors came from UP, Bihar, Rajasthan and Haryana, but we don't have villages to go back to after so many decades. Rajokri is our village where we have our temple and crematorium. Where can we go?""","The village has three clusters spread over 15 acres, with around 1,000 families living there.

In a dramatic scene that unfolded, Trump halted his speech to address the crowd after an attendee appeared to need immediate help.The event, which was Trump’s first outdoor rally since a shooting incident at his Pennsylvania campaign stop last month, took a tense turn when the former president noticed a commotion in the crowd.“What’s wrong?” Trump asked, his voice laced with concern, before amplifying his plea into the microphone: “A doctor, please!”As the sweltering heat bore down on the crowd—many of whom had waited for days to attend—Trump, visibly empathetic, turned his attention to the area where the attendee was being assisted. “It is very hot here,” he noted, acknowledging the challenging conditions. “Take your time, doctor, take your time, thank you!”In a show of solidarity, Trump joined the crowd in applause before stepping away from his bulletproof podium, flanked by Secret Service agents. He approached the area where the individual was receiving aid, offering a hug and words of reassurance before returning to the podium amid chants of “We love Trump.”Newsweek quoted the Secret Service saying that the incident was heat-related and that the individual received prompt care from EMTs. The spokesperson assured that the attendee was “fine” following the incident.This episode follows a recent tragic event at a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, where a 20-year-old gunman opened fire, resulting in one fatality and injuries to Trump and others. The shooter was killed by a counter-sniper, and the FBI is investigating the shooting as an assassination attempt.Trump’s rally in North Carolina, held at the North Carolina Aviation Museum & Hall of Fame, was a high-stakes event in a pivotal battleground state.

He offered strong support for Kamala Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz, painting Harris as a leader capable of addressing the nation’s challenges.“Kamala Harris will work to solve problems, seize opportunities, ease our fears, and make sure that every single American, however they vote, has a chance to chase their dreams,” Clinton said.He further praised Harris’s qualities, emphasising her vision, experience, and temperament.“Kamala Harris is the only candidate in this race with the vision, the experience, the temperament, the will, and yes — the sheer joy — to do that on good and bad days.

President Joe Biden engaged in a discussion with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday, emphasising the urgency of agreeing to a cease-fire in the Gaza conflict amid ongoing efforts by the United States to mediate a “bridging proposal” between Israel and Hamas . Vice-President Kamala Harris also participated in the call from Chicago.Biden “stressed the urgency of bringing the ceasefire and hostage release deal to closure,” according to a statement from the White House.The leaders aimed to use upcoming high-level talks in Cairo, involving mediators from the US, Israel, Egypt and Qatar to address the “remaining obstacles” to an agreement.Despite intensive diplomatic efforts, the hope for an immediate deal seems to be fading. Challenges persist particularly concerning Israeli troop presence in key Gaza corridors, which has cast doubts on a swift agreement.Last Friday, President Biden expressed optimism about a possible deal after consultations with Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al Thani and Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, who hold crucial roles in dialogues with Hamas.However, by Tuesday, Biden’s tone was more reserved, noting that “Hamas was now backing off,"" though the US remains committed to pushing for a cease-fire.Biden made his call to Netanyahu from Santa Ynez, California, where he is vacationing at the estate of medical technology mogul Joe Kiani. They also addressed escalating tensions between Israel and Iran and Tehran-backed groups like Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis.This conversation occurred in the context of secretary of state Antony Blinken’s recent meetings with officials in Israel, Egypt and Qatar before a new round of talks in Cairo planned for later in the week.“This is a decisive moment, probably the best, maybe the last opportunity to get the hostages home, to get a cease-fire and to put everyone on a better path to enduring peace and security,” Blinken stated after meeting with Netanyahu and Israeli President Isaac Herzog in Tel Aviv on Monday.Egyptian officials revealed obstacles to the bridging proposal that prevent Hamas from agreeing to it, beyond concerns about whether the proposal would genuinely end Israeli military presence in Gaza.An Egyptian official privy to the negotiations, who requested anonymity, indicated that the proposal’s initial phase involves Hamas releasing vulnerable civilian hostages taken in their October 7 attack. Subsequent phases would be negotiated without guarantees from Israel or mediators.The official detailed that the proposal lacks clear commitments from Israel to withdraw its forces from the Philadelphi and Netzarim corridors in Gaza. Although Israel has offered to downsize its forces in the Philadelphi corridor with ""promises"" to eventually withdraw, Hamas demands a complete withdrawal, including from the Philadelphi corridor—a narrow strip along Gaza’s southern border with Egypt.Earlier this week, Netanyahu met with right-wing groups representing families of fallen soldiers and hostages, who oppose a cease-fire. They reported Netanyahu’s assurance that Israel will not abandon its hold on the strategic corridors. Netanyahu's office has not commented on these claims.Blinken, after his visits to Egypt and Qatar, affirmed that the bridging proposal “is very clear on the schedule and the locations of withdrawals from Gaza,” though specific details remain undisclosed.","Biden made his call to Netanyahu from Santa Ynez, California, where he is vacationing at the estate of medical technology mogul Joe Kiani.

"'Should I get personal?': Trump fires back at Obamas for DNC attacks, says former president 'was very nasty’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/should-i-get-personal-trump-hits-obamas-for-dnc-attacks-says-former-president-was-very-nasty/articleshow/112695202.cms,"Former President Donald Trump quickly fired back at recent sharp criticisms from Barack and Michelle Obama during the Democratic National Convention (DNC), accusing the former first couple of making ""personal"" attacks. Trump’s response came during a campaign rally in Asheboro, North Carolina.During his keynote speech on the second night of the DNC, Barack Obama took aim at Trump’s fixation on crowd sizes, making a viral hand gesture that seemed to mock the Republican nominee.Michelle Obama also weighed in, turning one of Trump’s controversial campaign lines into a critique of “Black Jobs.”Trump expressed his frustration to the crowd: “Did you see Barack Hussein Obama last night taking little shots? He was taking shots at your president and so was Michelle,” Trump said.""He was very nasty last night. I try and be nice to people, you know? But it's a little tough when they get personal…’, he further said. “They always say, ‘Sir, please stick to policy, don’t get personal,’ but they’re getting personal all night, these people.”Later in the rally, Trump polled the crowd on whether he should take a personal approach in his response. The crowd cheered loudly for the personal option. “Should I get personal, or should I not get personal?” Trump asked, with the former winning by cheer volume.“We’d rather keep it on policy, but sometimes it’s hard when you’re attacked from all ends,” Trump said. He’s repeatedly said he’s been asked by allies to tamp down the attacks, and instead focus on the economy, where polls show he’s more trusted than Harris.Trump's rebuttal followed Barack Obama’s and Michelle Obama’s DNC speeches, which marked a departure from their 2016 call for higher standards in political discourse. Their remarks animated the convention with a scathing critique of Trump.This latest exchange adds to the ongoing tension between Trump and the Obamas. Trump has previously promoted the birther conspiracy questioning Barack Obama's citizenship and has made disparaging remarks about Kamala Harris's background.Despite advice from allies to focus on policy rather than personal attacks , Trump challenged this guidance. “Do I still have to stick to policy?” he questioned, as his supporters cheered his defiant stance.In his DNC address, Barack Obama had labeled Trump a ""78-year-old rich guy"" and criticized him for a “constant stream of gripes and grievances.” Obama highlighted Trump’s “childish nicknames, crazy conspiracy theories, and bizarre fixation on crowd sizes” as part of a broader pattern of behavior.Michelle Obama also took aim at Trump’s approach: “Going small is petty, it’s unhealthy, and, quite frankly, it’s unpresidential,” she said. “It’s his same old con: doubling down on ugly, misogynistic, racist lies as a substitute for real ideas and solutions that will actually make people’s lives better.”","Donald Trump responded to Barack and Michelle Obama's criticisms of him during the Democratic National Convention.

Obama’s call for a new chapter

A swipe at Trump’s ‘Stale act’

Praise for

Joe Biden

and Tim Walz

A convention highlight

Barack Obama energized the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday with a powerful endorsement of Kamala Harris and a sharp critique of former President Donald Trump . Addressing a cheering crowd, Obama asserted that America is ready for a new chapter under President Harris, dismissing Trump's approach as stale and ineffective.Barack Obama, America’s first Black president, urged delegates to back Harris as she seeks to make history on November 5 as the first woman and the first Black and South Asian US president.“I don’t know about you, but I’m feeling fired up!” Obama said, rallying the crowd with his characteristic enthusiasm.He praised Kamala Harris, declaring, “America is ready for a new chapter. America’s ready for a better story. We are ready for a President Kamala Harris.” Obama highlighted Harris’s dedication and hard-fought journey to success, contrasting her with Trump’s divisive rhetoric.Obama took a moment to reflect on the international stakes of the election. “By the way, that doesn’t just matter to people in this country. The rest of the world is watching to see if we can actually pull it off,” he said. “We shouldn’t be the world’s policeman, and we can’t eradicate every cruelty and injustice in the world. But America can be, must be, a force for good – discouraging conflict, fighting disease, promoting human rights, protecting the planet from climate change, defending freedom. That’s what Kamala Harris believes – and so do most Americans.”As the crowd erupted into chants of “Yes, she can!” Obama championed Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, as leaders dedicated to the working class. “In this new economy, we need a president who actually cares about the millions of people all across this country who wake up every day to do the essential, often thankless work to care for our sick and clean our streets and deliver our packages,” he said. “Kamala will be that president.”Obama did not hold back in his critique of Trump. “It’s one of the oldest tricks in politics – from a guy whose act has gotten pretty stale. We don’t need four more years of bluster and chaos. We’ve seen that movie – and we all know that the sequel’s usually worse,” Obama said.He dismissed Trump’s tenure as a series of grievances and conspiracies, referencing Trump’s fixation on crowd sizes and nicknames. “Here’s a 78-year-old billionaire who has not stopped whining about his problems since he rode down his golden escalator,” Obama quipped.Turning to Joe Biden, Obama expressed pride in his former vice president’s tenure and character. “This country will remember him as an outstanding president who defended democracy at a moment of great danger,” Obama said, adding that he was “even prouder to call him my friend.”Obama also extolled Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Biden’s running mate, for his genuine character and commitment to service. “Tim’s the kind of person who should be in politics – somebody who was born in a small town, served his country, taught kids, coached football, and took care of his neighbors,” Obama said, noting Walz’s authentic style.At 63, Barack Obama played a significant role in persuading Biden to step aside and endorse Harris. Harris, 59, has gained momentum with record-breaking fundraising and enthusiastic support.Speaking virtually from a rally in Milwaukee, Harris criticized Trump for his lack of remorse over the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade. ""I do believe, you know, bad behavior should result in a consequence. Well, we will make sure he does face a consequence and that will be at the ballot box in November,"" Harris asserted.The former president’s speech, following Michelle Obama’s heartfelt introduction, was a highlight of the convention. As the jumbotron displayed images of Tim Walz and his supportive wife Gwen, the crowd responded with enthusiasm.Michelle Obama, introduced by her husband, echoed the call for change. ""America, hope is making a comeback,"" she said, referencing her husband’s first campaign in 2008. She warned that Trump would attempt to distort Harris' truth, likening his attempts to previous efforts to discredit the Obamas. ""His limited and narrow view of the world made him feel threatened by the existence of two hardworking, highly educated, successful people who also happened to be Black,"" Michelle Obama said, prompting a strong response from the crowd.The convention also saw Republicans who have distanced themselves from Trump address the delegates. Former White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham and former Trump supporter Kyle Sweetser shared their experiences, with Grisham recounting her resignation after the January 6 Capitol attack. Republican Mayor John Giles of Mesa, Arizona, called for a return to the principles of the late Senator John McCain, emphasizing the need to move beyond Trump’s influence.Outside the convention, a protest near Chicago's Israeli consulate turned briefly violent, with a smaller group clashing with police. Most convention speakers avoided the topic of US support for Israel in the Gaza conflict, although Senator Bernie Sanders called for an end to the war and an immediate ceasefire.",Barack Obama urged delegates to back Kamala Harris as she seeks to make history on November 5 as the first woman and the first Black and South Asian US president. Obama highlighted Harris’s dedication and hard-fought journey to success. Obama did not hold back in his critique of Trump.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112668824,imgsize-443307,width-400,resizemode-4/112668824.jpg"

Michelle Obama delivered a powerful and confrontational speech at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) on Tuesday, sharply criticizing former US President Donald Trump and reinforcing her support for Kamala Harris .In a direct attack on Trump, Michelle invoked his previous controversial comments about undocumented migrants taking ""Black jobs."" “Who’s going to tell him that the job he is currently seeking might be one of those Black jobs?” Michelle said, referencing Trump's remarks.This comment highlighted the former president’s history of racially charged rhetoric and his claims questioning President Barack Obama’s eligibility for office.“For years, Donald Trump did everything in his power to try to make people fear us,” Michelle continued. “His limited, narrow view of the world made him feel threatened by the existence of two hardworking and highly educated, successful people who happen to be Black.”Obama's criticism didn’t stop there. She also addressed Trump’s insinuations about Kamala Harris and other Democrats not being “real Americans,” asserting, “No one has a monopoly on what it means to be an American, no one.”The former First Lady’s speech was not solely focused on attacking Trump; she also issued a call to action for all Americans, regardless of political affiliation. “Look, I don’t care how you identify politically, whether you’re Democrat, Republican, independent, or none of the above, this is our time to stand up for what we know in our hearts is right,” Michelle said. “To stand up, not just for our basic freedoms, but for decency and humanity, for basic respect, dignity, and empathy for the values at the very foundation of this democracy.”Turning her attention to Kamala Harris, Michelle praised the vice president as one of the most qualified candidates ever to seek the presidency. “Kamala Harris is more than ready for this moment. She is one of the most qualified people ever to seek the office of the presidency,” Michelle said, highlighting Harris’s accomplishments and her dignified representation, which she attributed to a legacy of strong women.Michelle opened her speech with a message of hope, reflecting on a nation fraught with uncertainty and subtly critiquing Trump’s tenure. “America, hope is making a comeback,” she declared, sparking a standing ovation from the crowd.","Michelle Obama delivered a powerful and confrontational speech at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) on Tuesday.

He also claimed that if ""comrade Kamala wins this November, World War III is virtually guaranteed to happen.""Trump also criticised his predecessor Barack Obama for making ""nasty"" comments about him during the Democratic National Convention.

However, the American Airlines staff were unfazed.“McCoy was polite, but he dropped his name several times,” the source was quoted as saying by the Times Union. Despite his efforts, “the American Airlines person didn’t care or know who he was.”The airline agent reportedly told McCoy, “You shouldn’t have gone and gotten food; you would have made your flight.”Unable to board, McCoy and his staffer were forced to book a different flight to Chicago on another airline later that day.When contacted, McCoy’s spokesperson, Mary Rozak, declined to comment on the specifics of the airport incident, saying, “I can’t speak to what happened or didn’t happen at the airport.” She did clarify that no public funds were used for the trip to the DNC.This incident comes amid speculation that McCoy might be positioning himself for a future role at the airport. The Albany County Airport Authority, where McCoy appoints three of the seven board members, recently chose not to renew the contract of the current long-serving airport director, fueling rumors about McCoy’s potential interest in the job.While many politicians faced delays en route to the convention due to a storm system in the region, McCoy’s delay was uniquely caused by his detour for a chicken sandwich .","Albany County Executive Dan McCoy reportedly tried to use his political influence to board an American Airlines flight to the Democratic National Convention.

At least 55 arrested after clashes with police outside Israeli Consulate in Chicago during DNC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/at-least-55-arrested-after-clashes-with-police-outside-israeli-consulate-in-chicago-during-dnc/articleshow/112691469.cms,"CHICAGO: At least 55 protesters were arrested following violent clashes with police in Chicago on the second night of the Democratic National Convention , a situation the police chief called “a danger to our city.”Chicago Police Superintendent Larry Snelling said Wednesday that those arrested outside the Israeli Consulate, about 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) from the United Center where Democrats were meeting, “showed up with the intention of committing acts of violence, vandalism.”“As the Chicago Police Department, we did everything that we could to de-escalate that situation,"" Snelling said during a news conference.""But there’s only so much de-escalation that you can attempt before it becomes excessive repetition.”The intense confrontations between pro-Palestinian protesters and officers began minutes into the demonstration, after some protesters — many dressed in black, their faces covered — charged at a line of police who had blocked their march. They eventually moved past the officers but were penned in several times throughout the night by police in riot gear who did not allow protesters to disperse.Snelling said protesters showed up to ""fight with the police"".""“We were not the initiators of violence, but we responded to it,"" Snelling said.Snelling said that between 55 and 60 people were arrested. Two people were taken to the hospital with minor injuries, one for knee pain and one with a finger injury, Snelling said. Two officers were injured but they refused medical attention because they did not want to leave fellow officers, Snelling said. He said three journalists were among those arrested, but he did not have details on charges.“Last night was a danger to our city and a danger to our citizens in this city, our residents’ property. And CPD has to protect that,” Snelling said.The Israeli Consulate has been the site of numerous demonstrations since the war in Gaza began in October, and protests during the DNC have largely focused on opposing the Israel-Hamas war..The group behind the protest Tuesday night is not affiliated with a coalition of more than 200 groups that has organized permitted rallies and marches — one that took place Monday and two more expected Wednesday and Thursday. Another rally, organized by the U.S. Palestinian Community Network, a Palestinian and Arab community-based organization, is planned for Wednesday afternoon near the United Center.On Tuesday night, organizers rallied demonstrators under the slogan “Make it great like ’68,” invoking the anti-Vietnam War protests that seized the city during the 1968 Democratic National Convention.“That was what they brought here to Chicago,” Snelling said. “It’s 2024. And the Chicago Police Department proved that. So let’s get off of 1968. Let’s stop talking about 1968. This is 2024.""A large portion of the arrests happened at the end of the night, as police pinned demonstrators in a plaza and blocked them from leaving. Snelling denied that police had “kettled” protesters, a tactic that involves corralling people in a confined area, which is banned under a federal consent decree.Snelling, who has been present at all major demonstrations so far during the convention, praised his officers. He said some female police officers were subjected to “vicious, nasty, sexually explicit” comments but that they ""stood their ground and they did what they had to do.”""I could not be more proud of the work that the men and women of this department are doing right now to keep this city safe,” he said.Snelling rejected criticism that the police response was overwhelming.“We wanted to overwhelm them,” Snelling said. “We wanted to overwhelm those people who decided to come to our city and destroy it. Now, overwhelming doesn’t mean that we were excessive. The response was proportionate.”The largest protest so far, which attracted about 3,500 people on Monday, was largely peaceful and resulted in 13 arrests, most related to a breach of security fencing. Two were arrested Sunday night during another mostly peaceful march.Also on Wednesday, a man who escaped from a Mississippi courthouse and is wanted on murder and armed robbery charges was taken into custody following a standoff with police at a restaurant about half a mile from the United Center. There was no indication that he had any connection to the convention.","At least 55 protesters were arrested following violent clashes with police in Chicago on the second night of the Democratic National Convention.
