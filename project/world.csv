Akshata Murthy's Heartwarming Gesture For Rishi Sunak As He Walks Out Of UK PM House | Watch

LONDON: Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer became the new prime minister of Britain on Friday, promising a “national renewal” after leading his party to a landslide victory, winning more than 400 of the 650 seats in the general election and bringing Labour back to power after 14 years in opposition. “Our work is urgent and we begin it today,” Starmer said.Labour had 412 votes and two seats were left to be declared at the time of going to press.Outgoing British Indian PM Rishi Sunak (44), who led the Conservatives, Britain’s oldest political party, to their worst electoral defeat in its nearly 200-year history, losing 250 seats (and winning 121), gave his resignation speech outside Downing Street in which he apologised to the country. He said he had given the job his all but the country had sent a clear signal that the govt must change. His wife, Akshata Murty, stood behind him in a blue-and-white striped dress looking close to tears. He will go down in history as the least successful UK PM at the ballot box.“I have heard your anger, your disappointment and I take responsibility for this loss,” he said. He then held Murty’s hand as they walked to the car to travel to Buckingham Palace for him to formally tender his resignation as PM to King Charles, the head of state, after his gamble of calling the early election failed spectacularly.Shortly after midday Starmer (61), who had called for the abolition of the monarchy when younger, went to Buckingham Palace to meet the King, accompanied by his wife Victoria in a red dress, where he was formally asked to form a Labour govt and appointed prime minister. It is the first time in more than 60 years that a knight of the realm will take up the office of prime minister.Starmer arrived in Downing Street to loud cheers and supporters waving Union Jacks where he gave his first speech as PM, first paying tribute to Sunak for being the UK’s first British Asian PM and for his dedication and hard work. But he said: “Our country has voted decisively for change” and “a return of politics to public service”. He said his govt would “restore service and respect to politics”. For too long the previous govt had turned a blind eye as millions slid into insecurity, he said.“We will govern country first, party second,” he said and promised to create wealth in every community, get the NHS back on its feet, and secure the borders.His first foreign visit will be to Washington on Tuesday, for the Nato Summit. Apart from his wife and two children, there will be another entrant to Downing Street, Starmer’s cat, Jojo, a rescue, who is expected to have turf wars with Larry, the No. 10 cat.On Friday morning white vans had already appeared outside Downing Street so that Sunak could move out.The night brought a string of high-profile Conservative casualties. Liz Truss, the former PM,lost her seat. Setting another record, eight cabinet ministerslost their seats, including defence secretary Grant Shapps, justice secretary Alex Chalk, and Leader of the House of Commons Penny Mordaunt.Another party which had suffered a crushing defeat was the pro-Scottish independence SNP which lost 38 seats in Westminster and were left with just nine seats.The election also saw big wins for the Liberal Democrats, Reform UK and Independents. The Liberal Democrats picked up 71 seats, also seizing three seats of former Tory PMs Theresa May, David Cameron and Boris Johnson .Reform UK, a brand new party set up by pro-Brexit and anti-immigration Nigel Farage, won four seats and came second to Labour in many seats. It was widely blamed for causing the Tories to lose as many seats as it did by splitting the Conservative vote. Farage himself entered the House of Commons for the first time, on his eighth attempt.The Green party won four seats. Five Independents also wonseats. Jeremy Corbyn, former Labour leader,won Islington North, standing against Labour, with a majority of 7,247. India-origin Praful Nargund had stood against him for Labour and lost with 16,873 votes. Labour frontbencher Jonathan Ashworth suffered a surprise defeat in Leicester South to Independent Shockat Adam, a 51-year-old local. Adam, who like many in the city has Indian roots, has lived in Leicester since the age of three when his family moved from Malawi to England.In Blackburn Independent Adnan Hussain overturned an 18,000 Labour majority to win by just 132 votes. City councillor Ayoub Khan won Birmingham Perry Barr, unseating Labour’s most senior British Pakistani MP, Khalid Mahmood, who had been MP since 2001.Independent candidate Iqbal Mohamed, whose parents arrived in the UK from India in the 1960s, gained Dewsbury and Batley from Labour. All five Independents were endorsed by a collective called Muslim Vote, which is campaigning for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.George Galloway’s Workers Party of Britain failed to secure a single seat and he lost his own seat of Rochdale.",Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer becomes the new prime minister of Britain on Friday.

?

Following a resounding electoral triumph, Keir Starmer , the leader of the Labour Party , is poised to succeed Rishi Sunak as the next Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.Along with this new role, Starmer and his wife, Victoria, will relocate to the official residence of the UK prime minister , 10 Downing Street in London's City of Westminster, from their current £1.75m townhouse in Kentish Town, situated within Starmer's Holborn and St Pancras constituency.While much attention has been focused on Keir's historic victory, less is known about his wife, Victoria, who maintained a relatively low profile during the election campaign. The couple, both lawyers by training, married in 2007, a year before Starmer became Director of Public Prosecutions.Their first encounter was an unlikely one at work, as Starmer recounted to Piers Morgan in 2021. As a barrister preparing for a court case, he demanded to speak to the lawyer who had drafted documents related to the case, which turned out to be Victoria. After inquiring about the accuracy of the documents, he overheard her saying, ""Who the bleep does he think he is?"" before she hung up on him.Starmer pursued her for months after that, and they have been together ever since. ""Vic is beautiful, she is grounded, we share values and we laugh together,"" Starmer said.Victoria, whose parents are Jewish, currently works in occupational health within the NHS. ""Half of the family are Jewish, they're either here or in Israel,"" Starmer told The Guardian last month, emphasizing that he and his wife are ""very keen"" for their children to understand their heritage.The new prime minister has also discussed his children's concerns about the upcoming move to Downing Street. ""Deep down they're worried that this (their lives) could change, which is why we will fiercely protect their privacy,"" he said.","Keir Starmer is poised to succeed Rishi Sunak as the next Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.

SRINAGAR: Two soldiers died of bullet wounds and four terrorists were killed in twin gunfights in south Kashmir’s Kulgam district Saturday. Lance Naik Pradeep Naik of Army’s Para Commando unit was killed in Modergam village, while havildar Raj Kumar of 1 Rashtriya Rifles died in Frisal Chinnigam area, officials said. The two operations are ongoing, with some more terrorists believed to be trapped at both sites.The terrorist death count touched nine from extensive security counteroffensives in J&K after four attacks in Jammu region on June 9, 11, and 12.These attacks resulted in the deaths of seven pilgrims, their local bus driver and conductor, and a CRPF constable. In response, five suspected Pakistani terrorists were killed in Kathua and Doda districts of Jammu.An official said a joint team of J&K police, 9 Rashtriya Rifles, and CRPF personnel launched a cordon and search operation in Modergam Saturday morning, following intelligence about the presence of terrorists. As the forces approached the suspected location, the terrorists started shooting, triggering a gunfight. “During the exchange of fire, Lance Naik Pradeep Naik was critically wounded. He died in hospital,” a police officer said.Later in the afternoon, a second gunfight erupted in Frisal Chinnigam. As a team of police, 1 Rashtriya Rifles, and CRPF approached a suspected hideout, they were met with heavy gunfire.“The forces retaliated strongly and four terrorists were killed, while havildar Raj Kumar was wounded. He was transported to the military’s 92 Base Hospital, where his condition deteriorated and he died,” an officer said.According to Kashmir zone IGP VK Birdi, four bodies (of terrorists) have been sighted at the site. “The exact number of terrorists killed or trapped, along with their identities, can only be ascertained once the shooting ends,” he said. “Both sites are in the interior areas and not near the Srinagar-Jammu national highway, where security forces keep tracking terrorist movements.”Security sources revealed that 23 local terrorists are active in Kashmir, with around 10 in Kulgam alone.","Lance Naik Pradeep Naik of Army’s Para Commando unit was killed in Modergam village. havildar Raj Kumar of 1 Rashtriya Rifles died in Frisal Chinnigam area.

SHIVAMOGGA: A 74-year-old man in Shivamogga, who had tested positive for Zika virus, died late Friday. Since the patient had comorbidities, doctors are yet to ascertain whether his death was directly caused by the virus.Nonetheless, this is the first reported incident of death in Karnataka of a patient with traces of the deadly virus in his body. Another patient infected with the virus in Shivamogga is currently under treatment at home.District health officer (DHO) Dr Nataraj told STOI the man who died was suffering from breathing problems and other age-related issues. ""He died at his residence in Gandhinagar after being discharged from the hospital,"" Dr Nataraj said. The patient was admitted to a private hospital on June 18.After his blood and urine samples were tested, the hospital referred the results to McGann Hospital . Experts at McGann analysed the samples and forwarded them to the National Institute of Virology ( NIV ) in Bengaluru for a final report.On June 21, the report from NIV confirmed that the patient was infected with Zika virus. Since then, he was under treatment at a private hospital.However, despite his unstable condition, his family insisted on getting him discharged against medical advice. The patient was taken home early on Friday. He passed away later that night.""Zika virus has no special treatment, except for symptomatic treatment, like any other viral infection,"" the DHO explained.""Every day, we analyse all test reports and if there is any suspicion, we send the sample in question to NIV for confirmation. Samples collected from pregnant women with symptoms are taken special care of and are invariably sent to the NIV,"" the DHO further said.Zika virus is transmitted primarily by Aedes mosquito bites that happen mostly during the day.

Defence plans

BRUSSELS: Spurred on by Russia's war in Ukraine and the spectre of Donald Trump's potential return to the White House, more of Nato 's European members are finally hitting the alliance's defence spending target.But as leaders gear up to celebrate at a Nato summit in Washington there is a clear feeling that will not be sufficient to tackle the challenges it faces.""Even in countries historically reluctant to spend more on defence, there is now a growing sense of the importance of greatly increased defence spending,"" said Ian Lesser, from the German Marshall Fund of the United States think tank.""I think, broadly speaking, in the next years we're looking at levels of defence spending that will begin to approach those of the Cold War.""A decade after setting a spending goal at two percent of gross domestic product, just over two-thirds of Nato's 32 countries are now expected to reach or top that threshold this year.That is up from only three allies in 2014.The increase in spending, which includes European heavyweights Germany and France, will be heavily showcased in Washington as Nato stages its show of unity.That is designed to send a message to Russia's President Vladimir Putin as he wages his war in Ukraine and menaces Nato from the east.But it is also a message for former US leader Donald Trump as he seeks to reclaim the Oval Office from incumbent Joe Biden at elections in November.Like other US leaders, upset that Washington shoulders too much of the burden with its vast defence budget, Trump spent his time in office demanding European countries do more.On the campaign trail in February he unleashed a firestorm by saying he would encourage Russia to ""do whatever the hell"" it wants to Nato allies not coughing up enough.A year after turning the two-percent benchmark from a target to a floor for spending at a summit in Vilnius, a growing number of Nato allies are already pushing to go further.Chief among them are the Baltic States and Poland -- with all comfortably spending more, and Warsaw even reaching over four percent.""In 1988 all of the allies were spending more than two percent, actually some even six percent on defence because the threat was real -- there was a Cold War going on,"" Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said.""Now we have a hot war in Europe and we are not spending enough,"" said Kallas, who was nominated last month as the European Union's next foreign policy chief.But the Washington summit still looks too early to set a more ambitious target.""I think we're keen to celebrate the progress,"" a US defence official said. ""There's not an appetite this year to change that benchmark to three percent.""A major motivation for ramping up spending is making sure Nato countries can actually fulfil ambitious new defence plans agreed last year to ward off any potential attack from Russia.After years of slashing budgets as fears of conflict eased in the wake of the Cold War, numerous allies have major gaps in their arsenals -- including key requirements such as air defences.As part of its planning, Nato commanders are telling capitals what they need to spend on.""We have specific capabilities targets for each and every ally,"" said alliance chief Jens Stoltenberg.""For many allies, this will mean three percent, and at least something more than two percent.""Diverting money away from issues like welfare, education and health is never an easy sell for governments.The likes of Canada, Italy and Spain still lag behind the Nato target and are reluctant to commit to going further.But diplomats at Nato said the direction of travel is clear -- spending targets will need to be hiked.""Some countries are still sticking their heads in the sand,"" said one diplomat.

Speaking on Geo News' 'Naya Pakistan' program, Sanaullah asserted that Imran Khan had been prohibited by the court from holding political meetings within the jail premises.""The PTI founder is not authorised to orchestrate plans for chaos while incarcerated,"" Sanaullah emphasised, pointing to unspecified evidence in possession of authorities that supposedly substantiates these claims.""We don't have audio or video evidence ourselves, but those responsible for security inside the jail do,"" Sanaullah clarified when asked about the proof of Imran Khan's alleged activities.Sanaullah's remarks followed complaints from leaders of the former ruling party, who asserted they were denied access to Imran Khan at Adiala Jail despite waiting for several hours. The adviser to the Prime Minister also criticised PTI's decision to stage a rally in Islamabad during the holy month of Muharram, suggesting it was aimed at sowing political turmoil, as reported by Geo News.""The PTI's desire to hold a public rally in Muharram is inappropriate and can lead to political chaos,"" Sanaullah remarked, while distancing the government from the decision to deny PTI permission for the Islamabad rally, according to Geo News.Earlier today, PTI cancelled its Islamabad rally after the federal capital's chief commissioner withdrew the No Objection Certificate (NOC) for the event in Tarnol. PTI leaders subsequently approached the Islamabad High Court seeking contempt of court proceedings against the administration for revoking the rally's permission.Expanding on his allegations, Sanaullah suggested that foreign elements supported PTI during the riots on May 9, 2023, following Imran Khan's arrest, with the intent to destabilise Pakistan.""Enemy countries aim to sow anarchy in Pakistan through PTI,"" he added, referencing the protests that targeted both civilian and military installations including Jinnah House and the General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, dubbed as the ""Black Day"" by the military, leading to arrests under the Army Act.Regarding foreign aid allegedly received by PTI, Sanaullah indicated a willingness to disclose evidence if the federal cabinet decided to make such information public, Geo News reported.","Rana Sanaullah, Prime Minister's Adviser on Political and Public Affairs, made the claims on Geo News' 'Naya Pakistan' program.

""Should that happen, it'll most likely be a Category 1 hurricane.""The earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic, Beryl caused at least 11 deaths as it passed through the Caribbean islands earlier in the week. It then battered Mexico as a Category 2 hurricane, toppling trees but causing no injuries or deaths before weakening to a tropical storm as it moved across the Yucatan Peninsula.Texas officials warned people along the entire coastline to prepare for possible flooding, heavy rain and wind as the storm nears.Dan Patrick, lieutenant governor, who is acting governor while Governor Greg Abbott is travelling in Taiwan, issued a pre-emptive disaster declaration for 121 counties.""Beryl is a determined storm, and incoming winds and potential flooding will pose a serious threat to Texans who are in Beryl's path at landfall and as it makes its way across the state for the following 24 hours,"" Patrick said in a statement Saturday,Some Texas coastal cities called for voluntary evacuations in low-lying areas prone to flooding, banned beach camping and urged tourists travelling on the July 4 holiday weekend to move recreational vehicles from coastal parks.Mitch Thames, a spokesman for Matagorda County, said Saturday that officials issued a voluntary evacuation request for the coastal areas of the county about 100 miles (160 kilometres) southwest of Houston to inform a large number of visitors in the area for the holiday weekend.""I certainly don't want to ruin the holiday weekend for our visitors. But at the same time, our No. 1 goal is the health and safety of all our visitors and of course our residents. I'm not so much worried about our residents. Those folks that live down there, they're used to this, they get it,"" Thames said.In Corpus Christi, officials asked visitors to cut their trips short and return home early if possible.

Three people have been reported dead in Grenada, three in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, three in Venezuela and two in Jamaica, officials said.Mexican authorities had moved some tourists and residents out of low-lying areas around the Yucatan Peninsula before landfall, but tens of thousands remained to tough out the strong winds and storm surge. Much of the area around Tulum is just a few yards (meters) above sea level.The city was plunged into darkness when the storm knocked out power as it came ashore.

2024 United Kingdom elections: Who is Keir Starmer? Britain's next prime minister,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/2024-united-kingdom-elections-who-is-keir-starmer-poised-to-become-uks-next-pm/articleshow/111496432.cms,"All you need to know about Keir Starmer

Keir Starmer was born in London in 1962 and grew up in the town of Oxted, Surrey, where he was raised by his toolmaker father and NHS nurse mother.[3]

He was politically active from a young age, joining the Labour Party Young Socialists at 16.

Starmer has a strong academic background, holding a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Leeds and a postgraduate Bachelor of Civil Law degree from the University of Oxford.

Prior to entering politics, Starmer had a successful career as a human rights barrister, serving as a human rights adviser to the Northern Ireland Policing Board and being appointed Queen's Counsel in 2002.

Starmer was Director of Public Prosecutions from 2008 to 2013, where he dealt with high-profile cases like the Stephen Lawrence murder.

He was elected to the House of Commons in 2015 as the MP for Holborn and St Pancras, a safe Labour seat.

Starmer supported the unsuccessful Britain Stronger in Europe campaign during the 2016 Brexit referendum, but later advocated for a second referendum under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership.

After Corbyn's resignation, Starmer won the 2020 Labour leadership election on a left-wing platform, positioning himself as a more centrist, pragmatic leader.[3]

As Labour leader, Starmer has sought to distance the party from the Corbyn era, emphasizing a more professional and electorally viable approach.[1][4]

Starmer is known for his vegetarianism, self-professed socialism, and a reputation that divides opinions, with some viewing him as moving towards the right in his pursuit of power.

Here are Keir Starmer's key policies as the likely next UK PM:

Economic stability: Starmer has pledged to ""deliver economic stability "" by sticking to ""tough spending rules"" and focusing on growing the economy. He has avoided making big-spending promises, instead emphasizing fiscal responsibility.

"" by sticking to ""tough spending rules"" and focusing on growing the economy. He has avoided making big-spending promises, instead emphasizing fiscal responsibility. NHS improvements : Starmer plans to ""cut NHS waiting times"" by providing 40,000 more evening and weekend appointments each week. This is aimed at addressing the NHS's staffing and backlog issues.

Border security: Starmer wants to ""launch a new Border Security Command"" to crack down on illegal migration and people-smuggling gangs. He has indicated a willingness to do a deal with the EU on migrant quotas.

Energy nationalisation: Starmer has promised to ""set up Great British Energy"", a new publicly owned clean power company, as part of Labour's plans for green energy transition.

Tackling anti-social behaviour: Starmer has pledged to ""crack down on anti-social behaviour"" as part of his law and order agenda.

Education funding: Starmer has committed to ""recruit 6,500 new teachers"" in key subjects to address staffing shortages in the education system.

Foreign policy: Starmer has promised a ""new strategic partnership"" with India, including pursuing a free trade agreement. He also plans to stop arms sales to Israel and progress towards recognizing a Palestinian state.

Keir Starmer is set to become the next prime minister of Britain, as his centre-left Labour Party is projected to secure a substantial majority in the parliamentary election.This victory will put an end to the 14-year reign of the Conservative government, which has been marked by frequent upheavals. Rishi Sunak's party suffered a resounding defeat in the polls.Labour has already secured more than 326 out of the 650 seats in parliament, and an exit poll indicates that the party is likely to win around 410 seats in total.After retaining his seat in north London, the 61-year-old Starmer addressed his constituents, saying, ""The change begins right here because this is your democracy, your community and your future. You have voted and now it is time for us to deliver.""Despite Starmer's decisive win, polls suggest that there is a lack of enthusiasm among the public for both him and his party. As he assumes power, he faces a multitude of formidable challenges that the country is currently grappling with.","Keir Starmer was born in London in 1962 and grew up in Oxted, Surrey.

He secured the win by pledging to engage with the West and relax the enforcement of the country's compulsory headscarf law , following a period of sanctions and protests that have strained the Islamic Republic. Pezeshkian's opponent, hard-liner Saeed Jalili , was defeated in the electoral contest.Pezeshkian secured over 17 million votes, while Jalili obtained more than 13 million votes in an election where approximately 30 million votes were cast, according to Iran's election authority. The voter turnout for this election, which was at historic low level, stood at 49.8 percent.Throughout his campaign, Pezeshkian refrained from promising any drastic changes to Iran's Shiite theocracy. He has consistently recognized Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as the ultimate authority in all matters concerning the state.However, Pezeshkian's modest objectives are likely to face challenges from an Iranian government that remains largely controlled by hard-liners, the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict in the Gaza Strip, and Western concerns about Tehran's enrichment of uranium to near-weapons-grade levels.In the early hours of the day, Pezeshkian's supporters, took to the streets in Tehran and other urban areas as his advantage over Jalili, a conservative former nuclear negotiator, continued to grow.The initial round of polling on June 28 experienced the poorest participation since the 1979 Islamic Revolution in the history of the Islamic Republic. The leadership in Iran has consistently stressed that the voter turnout is an indication of backing for the nation's Shiite theocracy, which has been under pressure following years of economic sanctions, widespread protests, and severe repression of all dissent.According to the vote count provided by the authorities, Pezeshkian secured 16.3 million votes, while Jalili received 13.5 million votes in Friday's election.The elections came after President Ebrahim Raisi, who was widely regarded as a close confidant and mentee of Khamenei, died in a helicopter accident in May. Many believed that Raisi was being groomed as a possible successor to the supreme leader position.Raisi's legacy was however, marred by his participation in the 1988 mass executions in Iran. Furthermore, he played a significant role in the violent suppression of protests that erupted following the death of Mahsa Amini in 2022 who had been arrested by the authorities for allegedly wearing her mandatory hijab improperly.","Masoud Pezeshkian, a reformist candidate and heart surgeon, emerged victorious in Iran's runoff presidential election on Saturday.

Axelrod argued that Biden should prioritize the country's needs over his re-election bid, suggesting that continuing his campaign could negatively impact his legacy.This call comes amid increasing pressure within the White House following Biden's unimpressive performance in a recent CNN presidential debate .Axelrod's remarks intensify existing doubts about Biden's campaign, which were not alleviated by a recent interview with ABC News. Axelrod described Biden's demeanor in the interview as exhibiting ""defiant delusion,"" indicating a gap between Biden's self-view and public perception.Concerns about Biden's viability as a candidate have grown, particularly after a widely criticized performance in Atlanta. In response, Biden has attempted to shift focus to contrasting his policies with those of former President Donald Trump. Biden criticized Trump's alleged involvement with ""Project 2025,"" a platform reportedly aiming to restructure the federal government along conservative lines. Biden's campaign warned that Project 2025 poses a threat to democratic principles such as reproductive rights and governmental checks and balances.Trump, distancing himself from Project 2025, claimed he was unaware of its specifics and stated that it does not represent his official policy. His campaign clarified that Project 2025 is not endorsed or aligned with Trump's platform.Amid these developments, Biden met with his campaign co-chairs to discuss his re-election strategy. Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, a campaign co-chair, described the meeting as open and focused on honest feedback. Coons emphasized Biden's determination to address doubts about his candidacy, especially among Democrats questioning his suitability as the party's nominee.Biden's aides are hopeful that recent positive feedback from a Wisconsin rally and his ABC News interview will enhance his image. They plan to increase direct voter engagement through town halls and press conferences to boost Biden’s public perception.Looking forward, Biden is set to hold his first formal press conference since the debate, coinciding with the end of the Nato summit.

At that time, her excuse was Barron was in school and needed her to stay nearby.This time too, Melania wants to stay with Barron Trump who is likely to join New York University and according to reports, Melania has already made a deal with Trump that she will only be at the White House on special occasions.After the first presidential debate on CNN, Melania's absence was pointed out as Jill Biden led Joe Biden off the stage and Trump left the stage alone. But Grisham said Melania was never a 'stand-by-your-man' spouse. Trump camp insiders, however, insist that Donald Trump relies of Melania's opinion far more than it might appear.Melania was not present during Trump's hush-money trial, at Trump's 78th birthday party or at any prominent fundraiser. Grisham believes that this absence was because of optics and Melania cares intently about her public image. In fact, Melania is increasingly thinking about what's good for her rather than for her husband.First Lady expert Kate Anderson Bower told Axios she believes Melania is distancing herself even more her husband and from the Washington social political scene. Mary Jordan, author of Melania biography said her absence makes her stand out in history from any other First Lady. Melania is not looking for any way out for her political responsibilities in case Trump is back at the White House because she is seriously concerned about Barron's college life.

Some Biden aides view the family's actions as an attempt to address longstanding grievances, while the family believes the debate was mishandled by the staff, who failed to properly highlight Biden’s strengths.This internal conflict has frustrated Biden’s staff, who believe the family’s emotional involvement is hindering their efforts to manage the crisis. A Biden campaign aides expressed that the situation is unproductive, while another close to the president suggested the family isn't grasping the political realities.“It’s not helpful,” one Biden campaign aide was quoted as saying.“It’s Shakespearean,” another close aid was quoted as saying.In an ABC News interview on Friday, Biden took full responsibility for his debate performance, asserting it was his fault alone.Hunter Biden’s recent attendance at White House meetings marks the beginning of expected deeper involvement from the family. Valerie Owens, Biden’s sister, also came to Washington this week for discussions about her brother’s campaign.However, White House chief of staff Jeff Zients has dismissed the rumors of internal strife, affirming the president and first lady’s confidence in their team. “The president and first lady have full confidence in their team. There is absolutely no truth to these unfounded and insulting rumors.”Family members feel that top aides have blamed the president for the debate's failure instead of accepting responsibility, which has particularly upset the Biden family . A source was quoted as explaining that the debate performance was the breaking point, with the staff's blame-shifting angering the family, who expected loyalty and accountability from the president’s aides.“I believe the family has witnessed blunder after blunder by key staff personnel and the debate is likely the straw that broke the camel’s back.”","Tensions between the family and some of Biden’s closest aides have been growing, and his debate performance has intensified the issue.

Pezeshkian's moderate stance and advocacy for limited reforms may lead to some changes in Iran's domestic policies, such as relaxing enforcement of the compulsory headscarf law.However, his ability to enact major shifts in Iran's foreign policy is constrained by the fact that the government remains largely controlled by hard-liners.","The US says it will continue to use diplomacy with Tehran ""when it advances American interests"" The State Department says it has no expectation the elections will lead to fundamental change in Iran's direction.

"Japan partners with Cambodia to share demining knowledge with Ukraine, other countries",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/japan-partners-with-cambodia-to-share-demining-knowledge-with-ukraine-other-countries/articleshow/111541643.cms,"PHNOM PENH: Japan 's foreign minister on Saturday announced a joint project with Cambodia to share knowledge and technology on land mine removal with countries around the world, including Ukraine .Foreign minister Yoko Kamikawa made comments during a visit to the Cambodian Mine Action Center , which was formed in the 1990s at the end of the Southeast Asian nation's decades of civil war.It seeks to deal with an estimated 4 million to 6 million land mines and other unexploded munitions left strewn around the countryside.""Cambodia, which has steadily advanced mine removal within its own country, is now a leader in mine action around the world,"" she noted, adding that Japan has consistently cooperated in Cambodia's mine removal since the civil war.Cambodian deminers are among the world's most experienced, and several thousand have been sent in the past decade under UN auspices to work in Africa and the Middle East. Cambodia in 2022 began training deminers from Ukraine, which also suffers from a high density of land mines and other unexploded munitions as the two-year Russian invasion drags on.""As a concrete cooperation under the Japan Cambodia Landmine Initiative, Japan will provide full-scale assistance to humanitarian mine action in Ukraine,"" she said. ""Next week, we will provide Ukraine with a large demining machine, and next month, here in Cambodia, we will train Ukrainian personnel on how to operate the machine.""The NGO Landmine Monitor in its 2022 report listed both Cambodia and Ukraine among nine countries with ""massive"" mine contamination, meaning they had more than 100 square kilometers (38.6 square miles) of uncleared fields.Since the end of the fighting in Cambodia, nearly 20,000 people have been killed and about 45,000 have been injured by leftover war explosives, although the average annual death toll has dropped from several thousand to less than 100.Despite a very active demining program, many dangerous munitions remain in place, posing a hazard to villagers.Cambodia's training of Ukrainian deminers, in Poland as well as Cambodia, came after former prime minister Hun Sen -in an unusual move for a nation that usually aligns itself with Russia and China - condemned Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, saying ""Cambodia is always against any country that invades another country.""Cambodia was one of nearly 100 UN member countries that co-sponsored a resolution condemning Russia's invasion.Several other countries, including the United States and Germany, have already provided Ukraine with demining assistance.Kamikawa also held talks with Cambodian prime minister Hun Manet and Hun Sen, his father who stepped down last year after ruling for 38 years.Kamikawa next goes to the Philippines, where she and Japanese defense minister Minoru Kihara will hold talks on Monday with their Philippine counterparts. They are set to discuss signing a mutual defense pact that would allow each country to deploy troops on the other's territory.","Cambodia in 2022 began training deminers from Ukraine, which also suffers from a high density of land mines.
