Captain Samira Zeenat Buttar, from Chandigarh’s Sector 36 led the Integrated Operational Centre tableau themed on Operation Sindoor on Kartavya Path, a role that brought together her recent commissioning, a rare multi-decorated military lineage, and a contemporary operational showcase at the national ceremony.Commissioned into the Indian Army in 2021, Captain Buttar represents a rare continuity of service across four generations. Her great-grandfather served with the 4th Hodson’s Horse in the British Indian Army. Her grandfather, Brigadier Sampuran Singh, then a Lieutenant Colonel, earned the uncommon distinction of being awarded both the Mahavir Chakra and the Vir Chakra for his role in the 1965 Indo-Pak war. He later raised the 19 Punjab Regiment and remained in service until he passed away in 1971 due to battle casualties sustained during the 1965 conflict.The lineage continued with her father, Sarbjeet Singh, an officer of the 8 Mechanised Infantry. Captain Buttar is the only child in the family and the fourth successive generation to wear the uniform.She credits her early grounding in discipline to her schooling. “As a boarding school student, I knew no other way of life than discipline,” Captain Buttar said. “Routine, structure and accountability were part of everyday life, and that shaped how I approached responsibility.”At the Republic Day parade, Captain Buttar led the Integrated Operational Centre tableau, which depicted coordinated planning and operational control. The assignment placed her in command of a display reflecting how contemporary military operations are planned and executed through integrated systems rather than single-arm deployments.Captain Buttar is an alumna of Lawrence School, Sanawar, where she spent her formative years. She said the boarding school environment prepared her for the demands of uniformed service. “You learn to manage yourself early. That stays with you,” she said.She was commissioned into the Army in 2021 after completing her training at Officers Training Academy, Chennai. She pursued a degree in law from the Army Institute of Law, Mohali. She is currently pursuing a PhD from the same institution, focusing on the study of military law in India.Captain Buttar’s presence at the Republic Day parade brought together region’s contemporary contribution to the Army and a family history that has moved with the institution itself- from colonial cavalry regiments and post-Independence infantry formations to today’s integrated operational doctrine.","Captain Samira Zeenat Buttar, from Chandigarh’s Sector 36 led the Integrated Operational Centre tableau themed on Operation Sindoor on Kartavya Path.

'Never Defied Cong In Parliament': 'Unapologetic' Shashi Tharoor Defends Modi Praise, Sindoor Stand

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor , who recently missed a crucial party meeting, sparking speculation about his future with the grand old party, missed another one on Tuesday, but stated he received the invitation at a very short notice, by when he had already made plans for a visit to Dubai.""As for not attending today's meeting, the invitation came only yesterday or the day before, by which time my travel plans were already finalised. With Parliament in session, I had booked my ticket directly from Dubai to Delhi,"" he told reporters.With the Budget session of Parliament starting on Wednesday, Congress legislative party (CPP) chairperson and former party chief Sonia Gandhi convened a meeting of the Congress' parliamentary strategy group at her residence to decide on the issues to be raised during the session.Sources confirmed that Tharoor, the four-time Thiruvananthapuram MP who has held the seat since 2009, could not attend the meeting as he was returning from Dubai. They added that the former diplomat had informed the party in advance about his inability to be present.Meanwhile, Tharoor said he would convey his ""issues"" directly to the Congress top leadership.""Whatever issues I need to raise, I will convey them directly to the party leadership.There is no doubt that I will get that opportunity, especially since everyone will be together during the Parliament session,"" he added.In recent months, Tharoor's repeated praise of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the government has irked the Congress, leading to him being ""sidelined"" from party affairs. He has been particularly vocal in his support for the government on Operation Sindoor , the five-day India-Pakistan conflict in May 2025. On the other hand, the Congress has sought to corner the Centre over alleged losses of Indian fighter jets during the conflict and US President Donald Trump's claims of mediating the truce between the two nuclear-armed rivals.","Congress MP Shashi Tharoor recently missed a crucial party meeting, sparking speculation about his future with the grand old party.

NEW DELHI: Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah lost his cool during a rally in Bengaluru on Tuesday after some youth Congress leaders started shouting slogans in favour of deputy CM DK Shivakumar before his address.As he rose from his chair and walked towards the podium, a section of party workers began shouting “DK, DK,” with the chants growing louder by the second.Visibly irritated, Sidda snapped at the crowd and asked them to maintain silence, but his appeal went unheeded, prompting him to angrily demand to know who was raising the slogans.""Who are those shouting ‘DK, DK’,"" an irked Siddaramaiah asked the Congress leaders.The situation forced the event’s compere to intervene, publicly warning Youth Congress leaders to stop interrupting the chief minister and listen quietly.""The Youth Congress leaders should keep quiet.

Siddaramaiah has sought to project confidence, asserting that he has the backing of the leadership and is certain of completing the full five-year term as chief minister, signalling his intent to shut down speculation over a possible leadership change.","Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah lost his cool during a rally in Bengaluru on Tuesday.

Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami on Tuesday said that the implementation of the Uniform Civil Code in the state has ushered in a new era of women's empowerment.Addressing a programme marking the first anniversary of UCC implementation, celebrated as 'UCC Day', Dhami said that discrimination, inequality, and injustice prevailed in society due to different personal laws for certain communities.He said, ""The implementation of the UCC has not only given equal rights to all citizens of the state but has also ushered in a new era of women's empowerment in the state.""""Not a single case of ' halala ' has been reported since the implementation of UCC,"" the chief minister said.Dhami said, ""Now the Muslim sisters and daughters of Uttarakhand have been freed from social evils like halala, iddat, polygamy, child marriage, and triple talaq. Not a single case of halala has been reported in Uttarakhand since the implementation of the UCC, and that is why Muslim women have welcomed this law.""The chief minister, however, also said that some cases of polygamy have been reported in the state, and the strictest action will be taken against them.Uttarakhand is the first state in the country to implement the UCC.Dhami said that for decades after independence, due to ""vote bank politics"", no one dared to implement the UCC, while a uniform code is already in force in all developed and civilised countries, including major Muslim nations.He said that all the framers of the Constitution, including Baba Saheb Ambedkar, had included the UCC in the Directive Principles of State Policy under Article 44 of the Constitution.Dhami said that before the 2022 Assembly elections, he had promised to bring the UCC, and the public supported him on this.Dhami said that work started as soon as the new government was formed, and after completing all the procedures, it was implemented on January 27, 2025.Describing this day as a ""golden chapter"" in the history of Uttarakhand, he said that it was a matter of immense personal pride for him that he had successfully implemented the law.The chief minister reiterated that the UCC is not against any religion or sect, but rather a legal effort to eliminate social evils and establish ""equality and harmony"" among all citizens.He said, ""Through this law, the fundamental beliefs and practices of any religion have not been changed; only the harmful practices have been removed.""Dhami said that the state government recently brought an ordinance related to necessary amendments in the UCC, under which there is a provision to annul marriages if a person conceals their identity or provides false information at the time of marriage.He said that, along with this, strict punitive provisions have been ensured for any kind of force, coercion, fraud, or illegal acts in marriage and live-in relationships.Dhami also honoured the officers who contributed to the UCC and those who did commendable work in its registration.","Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami on Tuesday said that the implementation of the Uniform Civil Code in the state has ushered in a new era of women's empowerment.

The SIT found that Gogoi and his wife have direct links with Pakistan, and they presented the proofs in front of the cabinet,"" the CM claimed.He said that Colburn was examined by the SIT sleuths during the course of the investigation, besides quizzing 22-25 more people.Referring to the citizenship of Gogoi's wife and children, Sarma said, ""In the family, there is one Indian and three foreigners. If he (Gogoi) had any shame, he should have immediately given Indian citizenship to his children after the controversy erupted.""Sarma claimed that the Assam Congress chief considers Indian citizenship as ""second-class"" and gives more importance to British citizenship.Earlier, the BJP leader had claimed that the opposition leader is a ""100 per cent Pakistani agent"".Sarma had alleged that Colburn had travelled 19 times between India and Pakistan and Gogoi had visited the neighbouring country on an invitation from its spy agency ISI and undergone training there.He also claimed that Colburn was collecting various classified government documents, mainly IB reports, on behalf of the Pakistani climate lobby.Hitting back, Gogoi had slammed Sarma over his accusation and questioned his mental state due to issues at the home front. He even said the CM's remarks were ""ridiculous, baseless, insane and nonsense"" and that he was behaving like an ""IT cell troll"" without talking with facts.","Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said the cabinet will take a formal decision on the future course of action on the SIT report on February 7.

Nepal Gen Z Protest EXPLODES For 2nd Time, Curfew Imposed, Cops Use LETHAL Force | Watch

(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: An Indian national from Gujarat, who escaped from a jail during last year’s ""Gen Z"" protests in Nepal, has been apprehended by Ahmedabad Police, officials said on Tuesday.Dharmesh Chunara, a resident of Thakkarbapa Nagar Road in Ahmedabad, was arrested by the Special Operation Group (SOG) Crime Branch, according to a police release.He had fled Bhadra Jail in Kathmandu, the capital of the neighbouring Himalayan country, during last year’s protests.Chunara, who had arrived in Kathmandu from Thailand's Bangkok, was caught with 13 kilograms of hybrid ganja valued at around Rs 13 crore. Following legal action by Nepalese authorities, he was sent to Bhadra Jail.During the protests, demonstrators vandalised the jail, leading to the escape of all inmates, including some Indian nationals. Chunara entered India via the Sonauli border in Uttar Pradesh, from where he came to Ahmedabad.According to police, the Nepal government released a list of escaped prisoners, based on which the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB), Delhi, circulated the details to all Indian states, including the CID Crime unit in Gujarat's Gandhinagar.Chunara, whose full name and address were not immediately available, was traced through a combination of human intelligence and technical analysis.In September 2025, Nepal was shaken by large-scale youth-led demonstrations, known as the “Gen Z protests.” The immediate trigger was the government’s ban on social media platforms, which escalated into violent clashes following a crackdown. The protests grew into a broader movement addressing multiple grievances, ultimately leading to the toppling of the KP Sharma Oli-led government and the formation of a caretaker administration.Nepal is now scheduled to hold its next parliamentary elections on March 5.","Dharmesh Chunara, a resident of Thakkarbapa Nagar Road in Ahmedabad, was arrested by the Special Operation Group (SOG) Crime Branch.

NEW DELHI: The Border Roads Organisation (BRO) on Tuesday rescued 60 people, including 40 soldiers of a Rashtriya Rifles unit, after they were stranded in a snowbound area of Jammu and Kashmir’s Doda district following heavy snowfall.The high-altitude rescue and road restoration operation was carried out under Project Sampark at Chatergala Pass on the Bhaderwah–Chatergala axis, located at an altitude of about 10,500 feet.The operation began on January 24, a day after continuous snowfall for nearly 40 hours blocked the route.According to the spokesperson, personnel of the 118 Road Construction Company (RCC) under the 35 Border Roads Task Force (BRTF) cleared around 38 km of road buried under five to six feet of snow.The route was reopened by the evening of January 25, allowing the safe evacuation of 20 stranded civilians and 40 personnel of the 4 Rashtriya Rifles, along with their weapons and supplies.The rescue mission was completed by the early hours of January 26 with no casualties. The operation was conducted in close coordination with the Army and helped restore critical communication links in the region despite extreme weather and difficult terrain.Meanwhile, the BRO also restored road connectivity in the Kandi-Kotranka area of Rajouri district after heavy snowfall disrupted movement in the Pir Panjal region.Snow accumulation of up to three feet had cut off the Kandi-Kotranka subdivision from Rajouri town, affecting both civilian and military movement, including medical emergency services.Personnel of the 110 RCC under the 31 BRTF launched round-the-clock snow clearance operations, using specialised equipment and manpower. A single-lane road was initially opened within 14 hours to allow controlled movement of vehicles, including emergency services.The spokesperson said that the clearance and widening work continued. Around 35 km of road was fully restored within 24 hours, ensuring safer and smoother movement in the area.","60 people, including 40 soldiers of a Rashtriya Rifles unit, were stranded in a snowbound area of Jammu and Kashmir’s Doda district.

Politics erupts over the incident

NEW DELHI: Calling the new University Grants Commission (UGC) rules a ""black law,"" Bareilly city magistrate Alankar Agnihotri resigned on Monday, saying the new rules meant for higher educational institutions could foment caste-based discontent.Agnihotri alleged that the new UCC law would vitiate the academic environment in colleges and should be withdrawn immediately.Agnihotri, a 2019-batch Provincial Civil Service officer, sent his resignation by e-mail to Uttar Pradesh Governor Anandiben Patel and Bareilly District Magistrate Avinash Singh, the officials told news agency PTI.The new rules notified by the UGC on January 13 -- the Promotion of Equity in Higher Education Institutions Regulations, 2026 -- have sparked widespread criticism from general category students who argue that the framework could lead to discrimination against them.The new regulations, introduced to stop caste-based discrimination in colleges and universities, ask institutions to set up special committees, helplines and monitoring teams to handle complaints, especially from SC, ST and OBC students.Meanwhile, the Uttar Pradesh government ordered disciplinary action against Agnihotri and attached him to the Shamli District Magistrate.In his resignation letter, Agnihotri said it becomes necessary to ""awaken"" the government when it adopts policies that ""divide society and the nation"".Talking to reporters after attending the Republic Day function Monday morning, Agnihotri said that the new UGC rules would lead to atrocities against Brahmins.The provisions were discriminatory and could lead to social unrest and internal discontent, he said.Levelling a serious charge against the Bareilly district magistrate Avinash Singh, Agnihotri, an alumnus of Banaras Hindu University (BHU) where he studied B.Tech and LLB, said he was held hostage and verbally abused, with people at the DM's residence saying: """" (Pandit has gone mad).""I was held hostage at the DM's residence for 45 minutes. A call came to the DM from Lucknow. I was verbally abused, and they said, 'pandit has gone mad (pandit paagal ho gayaa hai). Keep him hostage all night.' I had already informed the media about my situation. I was released at the behest of the Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP),"" Agnihotri was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Avinash Singh, however, dismissed the allegations, saying that when Agnihotri came to see him, all the Additional District Magistrates (ADMs), Sub-Divisional Magistrates (SDMs), Circle Officers, Local Intelligence Unit (LIU) officials, and the Senior Superintendent of Police of Bareilly were present at the DM's residence.Political leaders, particularly the ruling BJP's rivals, reacted to the development, saying that the resignation was a serious indicator of administrative pressure.Reacting to the development, state Congress president Ajay Rai called Agnihotri's resignation a serious issue.In an X post in Hindi, Rai wrote, ""The lathi charge on Shankaracharya (Avimukteshwaranand) and his disciples, and the administrative pressure -- all this shows that under the BJP rule, the Constitution, faith and freedom of expression are all under threat. The truth must come out. The state will be governed by the Constitution, not by fear,"" he wrote.Senior Samajwadi Party leader and former Bareilly MP Praveen Singh Aron also responded to the development.""The true strength of governance lies in upholding the principles of righteous rule (Raj Dharma) and constitutional values. This is not a question of politics, but of the very soul of democracy,"" he added.Meanwhile, Brahmin leaders have been gathering at the state guest house in Bareilly since Monday afternoon.A resident of Kanpur Nagar, Agnihotri previously served as a sub-divisional magistrate in key districts, including Unnao, Balrampur, and Lucknow. He is known in administrative circles for his straightforward views and strict working style. He has also worked in the United States.",Bareilly city magistrate Alankar Agnihotri resigns over new University Grants Commission rules. He said the new rules could foment caste-based discontent in higher educational institutions. He also said he was held hostage and verbally abused by Bareilly district magistrate.

Republic Day Parade Turns High Octane As Bike Daredevils Showcase Skill Discipline And Nerve

NEW DELHI: Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi attended Republic Day parade and 'At Home' reception at Rashtrapati Bhavan but the party's criticism of govt for not offering them front row seats in the parade triggered a row, with BJP accusing it of carrying a sense of entitlement. Congress, however, accused BJP of ""petty politicking"".Party MP Vivek Tankha said, ""I was shocked. Opposition used to be treated with respect. BJP leaders of opposition were never treated in this manner. By seating Kharge and Rahul in the back, you are insulting the Constitution. But it is too much to expect grace and respect for opposition from BJP govt. It would be part of a party's behaviour only if it has fought for freedom of the country and for the Constitution.""This is not the first time that seating arrangement at the parade has triggered a controversy. In 2018, Congress objected to seating of Rahul claiming he was given a seat in one of the fourth to sixth row instead of the front row as he was chief of a party. In 2024 I-Day celebrations at Red Fort, controversy again erupted after Rahul was seated in the second-last row with Olympic medalists.Hitting back at Tankha, BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla said Congress and Rahul suffer from a sense of entitlement and they believe VVIP treatment for them is more important than the country.Union minister Arjun Ram Meghwal was sitting behind Rahul, he added.""Seating arrangement is decided by a set format, which goes by order of precedence,"" he said. He noted Rahul often skipped important official events, I-Day and swearing-in ceremonies of vice president and CJI.BJP recalled their own LoPs Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley used to be given back row seats when Congress-led UPA was in office. At R-Day function in 2009, a veteran politician like L K Advani was seated in the back row, one of them recalled. Poonawalla accused Rahul of insulting North-East by allegedly refusing to wear a 'patka' offered by President Murmu to guests at the 'At Home' reception.Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma said, ""From the President and the PM to foreign dignitaries, everyone wore the 'patka' with respect and pride. Gandhi alone stood apart, reinforcing a perception of disregard towards North-East..."" Sarma demanded an apology from Rahul.","Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi attended Republic Day parade and 'At Home' reception at Rashtrapati Bhavan.

Republic Day Parade Turns High Octane As Bike Daredevils Showcase Skill Discipline And Nerve

NEW DELHI: From leading contingents to showcasing India’s missile arsenal to presenting daredevil skills on motorcycles, women military personnel stole the show during the 90-minute 77th Republic Day parade on Kartavya Path on Monday.Akshita Dhankar, a flight lieutenant with IAF, was part of one of India's highest ceremonial events — unfurling the national flag alongside President Droupadi Murmu. “It is a matter of great pride for me... Operation Sindoor was not just an Indian Air Force effort but a joint endeavour of all the armed forces,” she said before the majestic parade.Captain Harshita Yadav, daughter of an IAF officer, led an animal contingent that made its debut on Kartavya Path. The contingent included Bactrian camels from Ladakh, raptors (black kites), Zanskar ponies and indigenously bred hounds that are used by Indian Army in security, surveillance and logistical operations in border areas.Capt Samira Z Buttar, a fourth-generation Army officer, was the contingent commander of the Integrated Operations Centre tableau that showcased the success of Op Sindoor. A fourth-generation officer, Capt Samira had her moment of pride even as she was mourning the recent loss of her father, Col Sarabjeet Singh Buttar (retd).“Being a contingent commander during this Republic Day parade is a tribute to my father,” she said, putting up a brave front.The IAF marching contingent was led by Squadron Leader Jagdesh Kumar along with Squadron Leader Nikita Choudhary. The IAF band, led by Sergeant Charles Antony Daniel, supported the marching contingent and comprised 72 elite musicians, including 57 Agniveervayu and nine Agniveervayu women.Simran Bala, assistant commandant of CRPF, scripted history by leading an all-male contingent of India’s largest central armed police force. The 26-year-old officer, who hails from J&K’s Rajouri district, led the squad of 147 male personnel. Bala, who joined the force less than a year ago, is the first woman from the district to join CRPF in officer rank.CRPF and SSB all-women contingents also marched down Kartavya Path during the parade, led by assistant commandants Seema Nag and Naveen Kumari, displaying discipline and confidence. The high-octane display by women motorcycle daredevils emerged as one of the key highlights of the parade, drawing applause for its precision, balance and coordination. Girls also participated enthusiastically as part of NCC contingents and cultural programmes.","Women military personnel stole the show during the 90-minute 77th Republic Day parade on Kartavya Path on Monday.

NEW DELHI: India’s military offensive, courage and valour displayed during Operation Sindoor were showcased in front of European chief guests and thousands of spectators on Kartavya Path during the 77th Republic Day parade on Monday when the country made a grand display of lethal weapon systems, missiles, anti-missile shield and fighter jets used during the conflict against Pakistan last year.A glass-cased integrated operational centre, depicting the conduct of Op Sindoor with the use of weapons systems such as BrahMos and S-400 missiles rolled down Kartavya Path. Two key pillars of India's air defence architecture, Akash weapon system and ABHRA Medium-Range Surface-to-Air Missile System (MRSAM) that formed a robust layered shield for the Indian Army during the conflict last May were also displayed.For the first time, the parade showcased a phased ‘Battle Array Format’ of the Indian Army that included an aerial component. A tri-services tableau led by Captain Samira Buttar depicted replicas of major weapon systems deployed during Op Sindoor against Pakistan. Even helicopters carrying Operation Sindoor flags flew over the Kartavya Path before the start of the parade.Besides Op Sindoor weapon systems, the military also flaunted the rocket launcher ‘Suryastra’, Shaktibaan, followed by Divyastra, equipped with cutting-edge surveillance and targeting technologies.Mechanised columns on display included BMP-II Infantry Combat Vehicle, along with Nag missile system (Tracked) Mk-2.In a first, DRDO showcased its hypersonic glide missile LR-AShM, which is capable of engaging static and moving targets and designed to carry various payloads.The parade was led by Parade Commander Lt General Bhavnish Kumar, General Officer Commanding, Delhi Area, a second-generation army officer. Among the 18 marching contingents and 13 bands, debut appearances were of newly-raised Bhairav Light Commando Battalion, Scouts contingent and a specially-curated animal contingent from the Remount & Veterinary Corps (RVC). Artillery systems on display included the Dhanush 155 mm, 45-calibre towed artillery gun and AMOGH Advanced Towed Artillery Gun System (ATAGS), demonstrating India's long-range precision strike capability. For the first time, the Army displayed several drone systems, robotic mules carrying assault rifles, all-terrain vehicles and sharpshooters in the parade.A military contingent from the European Union, carrying the military staff flag and flags of Operations Atalanta and Aspides, naval operations of the grouping, also featured at the parade as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Antonio Costa were the R-Day chief guests. It was the EU's first participation in such an event outside Europe.In the parade, a high mobility reconnaissance vehicle and India's first indigenously-designed armoured light specialist vehicle also participated for the first time. The combat elements then followed with T-90 Bhisma and Main Battle Tank Arjun rolling past the saluting dais with aerial support from US-made Apache AH-64E and Prachand light combat helicopters.Before the starting of the parade, IAF Group Captain and astronaut Subhanshu Shukla was honoured with the Ashok Chakra by President Droupadi Murmu for his historic ISS space mission.A total of 29 aircraft, including 16 fighter jets like Rafale and Sukhois — that were used in Op Sindoor— four transport aircraft and nine helicopters, participated in the flypast.The IAF deployed around 20 fighter jets along with Netra AEW&C aircraft, to create an aerial shield against any possible threat to the R-day celebrations in New Delhi.","India's military offensive, courage and valour displayed during Operation Sindoor were showcased in front of European chief guests.

Watch: Padma Shri 2026 Awardees Beam With Joy as Lifelong Work Gets Honoured

NEW DELHI: RVS Mani, a former officer in the ministry of home affairs (MHA) named for the Padma Shri this Republic Day eve, was instrumental in blowing the lid off the two contradictory affidavits filed by the UPA govt in 2009, under his signature, in the Ishrat Jahan encounter case.While the first affidavit had cited pinpointed inputs by central intelligence agencies establishing Jahan as part of an LeT module tasked to assassinate high-level political functionaries in India, the subsequent affidavit went on to dismiss the evidentiary value of these intelligence inputs and distanced the Centre from Gujarat govt's action based on the inputs.It was several years later that Mani went public, indirectly claiming ""political interference"" to revise the affidavit. Mani owned up to having drafted the first affidavit filed on Aug 6, 2009, based on intelligence reports he had seen and found to be ""precise, accurate and exact"". He said the reports had clear details regarding terror antecedents of the four-member module, comprising Jahan, Javed Shaikh alias Pranesh Pillai, Jishan Johar and Amjad Ali, and laid down the sequence of events leading up to the encounter in Ahmedabad on June 15, 2004, in which all four were neutralised.The original affidavit cited Indian newspaper reports based on the claim made in LeT mouthpiece 'Ghazwa Times' that ""the veil of Ishrat Jahan, a woman activist of LeT, was removed by Indian police and her body kept with other 'mujahideens (terrorists)'"", as a confirmation of her terror links. However, in a subsequent affidavit filed on Sept 29, 2009, MHA said all intel inputs do not constitute conclusive proof and it is for state govt and state police to act on such inputs. It was submitted Centre was in no way concerned with such action and does not condone or endorse any unjustified or excessive action. While the first affidavit said the case was not fit for investigation by CBI, the second said the Centre would not object to an independent inquiry or CBIprobe.Mani had later said the second affidavit was not drafted by him and that he had signed and filed it as he was under orders. According to a statement made in 2016 by then home minister Rajnath Singh in Parliament, the second affidavit (in 2009) was vetted by the then attorney general and approved by the then home minister (P Chidambaram). Notings on the file did not mention any reason for revising the affidavit. Rajnath's statement also cited testimony of 26/11 accused and American LeT operative David Coleman Headley, confirming Jahan as ""a female terrorist"" killed by the Indian police in a botched-up LeT operation.Mani had also said he was ""tortured"" by the chief of SIT when summoned in 2013. Mani has penned several books based on the central theme of political interference in terror investigations, including 'The Myth of Hindu Terror: Insider Account of Ministry of Home Affairs' and 'Deception: A Family that Deceived the Whole Nation'.","RVS Mani, a former officer in the ministry of home affairs (MHA) named for the Padma Shri this Republic Day eve.

US Representative for Minnesota's 5th congressional district Ilhan Omar, during a Townhall, was sprayed by an unidentified substance by a man, who was then tackled and restrained. The incident occurred amid rising tensions over federal immigration enforcement following the recent fatal shooting of a nurse and mother by federal agents in Minneapolis.The attacker, wearing a black jacket, was quickly subdued, as the crowd cheered. Witnesses reported seeing him spray something on Omar. The congresswoman continued the town hall after the man was removed from the premises.Just before the attack, Omar had called for the dismantling of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and demanded Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's resignation. ""ICE cannot be reformed,"" she said during the meeting.Omar's office issued a statement, revealing that the man was stopped and taken into custody. “During her town hall, an agitator tried to attack the Congresswoman by spraying an unknown substance with a syringe.

During the show, Starmer was handed a pair of sunglasses, which he put on before saying “Bonjour,” a playful nod to Macron.A clip of the moment was later shared on TikTok. Starmer referenced the film Top Gun in the caption, writing: “Talk to me, Goose.” Macron responded in the comments, joining in the joke: “For sure.”The exchange followed Macron’s appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos last week, where he wore dark, reflective aviator sunglasses while delivering a speech on geopolitics. The French president was responding to threats from Donald Trump over tariffs on European countries unless they agreed to a US purchase of Greenland.In his speech, Macron criticised Washington’s tone, defended European sovereignty, and spoke about Europe’s role on the global stage as leaders debated the impact of Trump’s renewed interest in Greenland.He said: “…having a place like Europe, which sometimes is too slow, for sure, and needs to be reformed for sure, but which is predictable, loyal, and where, well, you know that the rule of the game is just a rule of law, it’s a good place.And I think this is a good place for today and for tomorrow.”Macron kept his sunglasses on while speaking indoors, which drew attention online. His office later said the reason was medical, explaining that the president had suffered a burst blood vessel in his eye and was wearing sunglasses to protect it from harsh lighting.","Keir Starmer made light of French President Emmanuel Macron’s recent appearance in aviator sunglasses.

‘Bigger Armada Than Venezuela’: Trump Roars At Iran After ‘Finger On Trigger’ Threat





US President Donald Trump has said that another American “armada” is moving towards Iran, while expressing hope that Tehran would agree to a deal with Washington, adding to tensions already high in the Middle East.Speaking at a public event in Iowa, Trump said, “By the way, there's another beautiful armada floating toward Iran right now. So we'll see. I hope they make a deal. I hope they make a deal.”It was not immediately clear whether Trump was referring to the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group, which arrived in the region on Monday, or another set of US warships.His remarks come amid increased US military activity in the region. Trump had said earlier that the situation with Iran was “in flux”, noting that he had sent a “big armada” to the area while believing that Tehran genuinely wants to negotiate.He told Axios that diplomacy remained an option, saying, “They want to make a deal. I know so. They called on numerous occasions.”Iran, meanwhile, has issued sharp warnings in response to the US military build-up.An Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commander said neighbouring countries would be considered hostile if their territory was used to launch an attack against Iran.“Neighbouring countries are our friends, but if their soil, sky, or waters are used against Iran, they will be considered hostile,” Mohammad Akbarzadeh, political deputy of the IRGC naval forces, was quoted as saying by the Fars news agency.According to news agency AFP, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has also warned that US “threats” would only destabilise the region, as Washington has not ruled out military action over Iran’s crackdown on protests.Saudi Arabia has said it will not allow its airspace or territory to be used for any attack on Iran, AFP reported.While Trump has publicly kept the door open for talks, US officials were quoted by Axios as saying that military options remain on the table, with additional naval, air and defence assets being moved into the region.Iranian officials, for their part, have repeatedly warned that any attack would be met with a strong response, underlining the fragile and volatile nature of the current standoff.","US President Donald Trump has said that another American 'armada' is moving towards Iran.

YouTuber Adam the Woo’s father Jim Williams confirms cause of death after autopsy report





YouTuber Adam the Woo, whose real name was David Adam Williams, died from natural causes, his family has now confirmed. He was 51 years old. Adam was found dead at his home in Celebration, Florida, on Dec. 22, just one day after he posted his final YouTube video. In a Facebook post shared on Monday, Jan. 26, Adam’s father, Jim Williams, said an autopsy showed Adam died from atherosclerotic and hypertensive cardiovascular disease. He explained that the condition caused a heart attack while Adam was asleep.The update ends weeks of questions from fans who followed Adam’s daily travel videos for years. His father also asked people to stop guessing and remember Adam with love. The details were shared publicly to bring peace to those who cared deeply about him. Adam had a strong online following and was known for sharing calm, everyday moments from his travels. His sudden death shocked fans across the world.Jim Williams said the autopsy report made it clear that his son died from natural causes. In his full statement, he wrote, “The short answer is… natural causes.” He added, “Our beloved son… your beloved friend… died, in essence, of a heart attack in his sleep from health issues he probably never knew he had.”Jim also shared that, despite the pain, he felt grateful about where and how Adam passed away. He wrote, “Now, we can all stop guessing. Be grateful the Lord allowed him to die at home and not in a foreign country.” He continued, “Be grateful he was found by friends and not some nameless stranger.”According to the Mayo Clinic, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease happens when plaque builds up in the arteries.

A US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent warned a legal observer on Tuesday in Minnesota, saying that if “you raise your voice, I will erase your voice.”“Are you serious? You said if I raise my voice, you will erase my voice?” the observer asked incredulously.“Yes, exactly,” the agent responded.Within the last three weeks, agents with ICE and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) shot and killed two US citizens: Veterans Affairs ICU nurse Alex Pretti and award-winning poet Renee Nicole Good.The agencies also deported people from the US without due process, ripped children from their parents, and ushered thousands of untrained agents into cities and neighbourhoods where they were not wanted.A CBS News poll published days before Pretti’s killing on Saturday in Minneapolis found that 61 percent of surveyed Americans felt that ICE agents were “too tough” when stopping and detaining people.In response, thousands of Minnesotans rose up in protest, creating a call for change that reached Washington.By Monday, Donald Trump unveiled a new plan for Minnesota. In a post on Truth Social, Trump announced that border czar Tom Homan would be sent to Minnesota to run ICE and CBP.CBP boss Greg Bovino, on the other hand, was removed.Meanwhile, the president almost immediately blamed the de facto leaders of his deportation scheme, namely DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and Homeland Security adviser Stephen Miller, seeking to present himself to reporters as a level-headed witness to the ICE killings rather than the primary and active architect of the agency’s recent overreach.","A US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent warned a legal observer on Tuesday in Minnesota, saying that if “you raise your voice, I will erase your voice.”Within the last three weeks, agents with ICE and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) shot and killed two US citizens: Veterans Affairs ICU nurse Alex Pretti and award-winning poet Renee Nicole Good.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127666820,imgsize-10934,width-400,resizemode-4/ice-agent-screenshot-from-the-clip-circulating-on-x.jpg"

This shocking find, tied to a controversial MAGA supporter known for questioning election results, included assault rifles and a massive haul of ammunition.

Trump To Pull Out ICE From Minnesota? Panic Hits White House After Fiery Backlash From MAGA Voters





Authorities in Shasta County struck gold when, while searching for illegal marijuana, they accidentally came across a massive stash of illegal firearms and a secret underground bunker at the home of a MAGA activist.On January 20, Michael Jay Kamfolt, 40, was arrested by the California Highway Patrol (CHP) after officers found an array of illegal firearms, including three AR-15-style assault rifles, a sawed-off shotgun, and more than 10,000 rounds of ammunition. He is, however, no longer in custody, according to county records.CHP Northern Division Chief John Pinoli said in a statement that the scale of the ammunition indicated an imminent threat to public safety. He said, “The combination of a hidden bunker and an alarming cache of illegal firearms and ammunition highlights the threat posed to public safety.”According to a report by Shasta Scout, Kamfolt is a conservative activist who has raised concerns about voter fraud. He also has a record of attending protests and County Board of Supervisors meetings. Shasta County has become a centre point of hard-right governance and election denialism in the current American context.The county board consists of a majority of staunch conservatives.Kamfolt shares a close relationship with Kevin Crye, a county supervisor and MAGA supporter. He has described himself as a “good friend” of Crye who would “do anything to help him out,” while confronting protesters outside Crye’s business in May 2025.Crye, a pro-Trump election denier, narrowly survived a recall effort in March 2024.After Kamfolt’s arrest, Crye released a Facebook video stating that Kamfolt should not be judged until proven guilty. He said, “It came to my attention today that a supporter, and I’ll even say a friend of mine, was arrested last night, and my heart is truly broken.”The CHP had received a tip in December about a suspected illegal marijuana grow at Kamfolt’s Anderson property. After securing a search warrant, authorities conducted reconnaissance for a month before finally searching the property on December 20. During the search, they discovered a 100-foot tunnel equipped with power, ventilation, a concrete floor, and built-in drainage.The tunnel also featured a sprawling secret cavern that contained a home gym, an armchair, and a television. Among the decorations was a Bennington flag, one of the historical American flags carried by supporters of President Trump during the January 6 riot.Officers also seized 13 firearms, four soft body armour vests, and 30 high-capacity magazines. Two of the guns were reported stolen, one in 2016 and the other in 1978, according to the CHP.Kamfolt was arrested on suspicion of multiple misdemeanour and felony weapons-related violations. These included converting a firearm into a machine gun, manufacturing a ghost gun, possession of a stolen firearm, and possession of armour-penetrating ammunition.The CHP’s investigation is ongoing and has been presented to the Shasta County District Attorney’s Office for filing consideration, according to a department spokesperson.","Michael Jay Kamfolt, 40, was arrested by the California Highway Patrol (CHP) on January 20.

This strategic decision comes in the wake of demographic challenges and an ongoing conflict, underlining the need for skilled labor. Following a recent mobility agreement, many Indian professionals are already contributing to the Russian workforce.

Putin Says India Ready To Boost Work On EAEU Trade Agreement, Hails Indian Economy





Russia plans to bring at least 40,000 Indian workers in 2026 to help fill a growing shortage of workers caused by a declining population, people leaving the country, and the ongoing war in Ukraine since 2022.The figure was confirmed by Boris Titov, Russia’s special representative for relations with international organisations in the field of sustainable development, in comments to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti.India’s ambassador to Moscow, Vinay Kumar, also told the agency that between 70,000 and 80,000 Indian citizens were already working in Russia by the end of 2025.The move follows a labour mobility agreement signed in December 2025 during a meeting in New Delhi between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The agreement includes a planned quota of more than 70,000 Indian workers for 2026.Border data reviewed by Deutsche Welle shows that Indian migration to Russia has been rising steadily. Around 32,000 Indian citizens crossed into Russia in the first quarter of 2025, followed by 36,000 in the second quarter. The number then jumped to 63,000 in the third quarter of the year.Indian workers are being recruited through both official and unofficial agencies.These agencies are expected to provide information about jobs and working conditions. Wages for low-skilled Indian workers range between €475 and €950 per month ($556 to $1,112).In December, Russian outlet Fontanka reported that Indian workers were cleaning streets in St Petersburg. Some told the outlet they earned around 100,000 rubles per month, received free accommodation and meals, and were offered Russian language courses. City officials said around 3,000 Indian citizens had arrived in St Petersburg looking for work.In the past, some Indians became victims of fraud. Reportedly, some citizens were misled into signing contracts with the Russian army and were later sent to fight in Ukraine.Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, 126 Indians have signed army contracts, according to MEA. At least 12 have been killed, while 96 have returned to India, according to the foreign ministry.Economist Igor Lipsits said language could become a major barrier, noting that most Indian workers do not speak Russian, while many Russians do not speak English. “You bring people into the country with whom you cannot communicate,” he said.Economist Andrei Yakovlev said Russia’s focus on India may also be driven by a desire to reduce migration from Muslim-majority Central Asian states.Russia’s labour shortage stood at around 2.2 million workers in 2024, according to official figures cited by DW.","Russia plans to bring at least 40,000 Indian workers in 2026.

Can 2ndAmendment be repealed?





President Donald Trump questioned why 37-year-old Alex Pretti was carrying a gun when he was shot and killed by a Border Patrol agent in Minneapolis.Trump told reporters on Tuesday said that he didn’t believe Pretti was an “assassin” but questioned why he was armed.“You can’t have guns. You can’t walk in with guns. You can’t do that. It’s just a very unfortunate thing,” he said.At an event in Iowa on the same day, Trump reiterated that the shooting was ""very unfortunate"" but that, ""I don't like that he had a gun.""His administration has long advocated for a broad interpretation of the Second Amendment. The January 24 shooting that killed Pretti happened weeks after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good in the same city.Pretti was carrying a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun at the time of the incident, according to DHS.Videos of the shooting did not show Pretti wielding a gun in the moments before he was shot. He was shown holding his phone up to record law enforcement, which is protected under the First Amendment.A witness also didn’t see Pretti brandish the gun in front of law enforcement, according to a sworn statement filed in federal court.Minnesota law allows those with permits to carry guns in public and does not require them to be concealed.Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said Pretti was ""exercising his First Amendment rights to record law enforcement activity and also exercising his Second Amendment rights to lawfully be armed in a public space in the city.""Some in Trump’s administration defended the agent, describing Pretti as a “domestic terrorist” who intended to kill law enforcement. Pretti’s family released a statement saying that was a lie and calling such comments “reprehensible and disgusting.”In an interview published in The Wall Street Journal on Jan. 25, Trump said he “(doesn’t) like any shooting.”""But I don’t like it when somebody goes into a protest and he’s got a very powerful, fully loaded gun with two magazines loaded up with bullets also,” Trump said. “That doesn’t play good either.""Yes, the constitutional amendment can be repealed. Any proposed amendment to the Constitution required passage by both the House and the Senate with two-thirds majorities, and then needed ratification by three-fourths of the 50 states, or 38 of them.The ""arduous process has winnowed out all but a handful of the amendments proposed over the past 230 years,"" Ron Elving, senior editor and correspondent on the Washington Desk for NPR News, wrote earlier this month.""Even relatively popular ideas with a big head of steam can hit the wall of the amendment process. How much more challenging would it be to tackle individual gun ownership in a country where so many citizens own guns — and care passionately about their right to do so?"" Elving wrote.He pointed out the ""tremendous support"" gun ownership had in large parts of the nation, especially the South, West and Midwest, ""which would easily total up to more than enough states to block a gun control amendment.""A second option for repealing an amendment was to hold a Constitutional Convention. In that case, two-thirds of state legislatures needed to call for such a convention, and states wrote amendments that then needed ratification by three-fourths of the states.",President Donald Trump questioned why Alex Pretti was carrying a gun when he was shot and killed by a Border Patrol agent in Minneapolis.

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday warned that the United States would end all support for Iraq if former prime minister Nouri al-Maliki returns to power.Trump said Iraq would be making a “very bad choice” by bringing Maliki back. Maliki has been nominated for the post by the largest Shiite political bloc in the country.In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said that when Maliki was last in office, Iraq fell into poverty and chaos. He said this should not be allowed to happen again.Trump said that because of Maliki’s policies and ideology, the United States would stop helping Iraq if he is elected prime minister. He added that without US support, Iraq would have no chance of success, prosperity or freedom.Maliki stepped down in 2014 after pressure from the United States, which blamed his sectarian policies for contributing to the rise of the Islamic State group.The United States holds significant leverage over Iraq, as most of the country’s oil export revenues are kept at the Federal Reserve Bank in New York under an arrangement made after the 2003 US invasion. Oil sales make up around 90 per cent of Iraq’s government income.Trump’s comments came days after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio raised similar concerns in a phone call with current prime minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani. Political sources said Washington had also sent a letter to Iraqi leaders stating its negative view of Maliki.By tradition, Iraq’s prime minister has been a Shiite Muslim since the fall of Saddam Hussein. On Saturday, the Coordination Framework, a group of Shiite parties that holds a majority in parliament, backed Maliki’s nomination.","Trump said Iraq would be making a ‘very bad choice’ by bringing Nouri al-Maliki back.

Instead, a single line in the letter reignited a different and older debate, prompting Hindu groups to accuse him of perpetuating a historical misunderstanding that has long stigmatised a sacred religious symbol.In the paid advertisement titled “To Those I’ve Hurt”, Ye apologised for a series of antisemitic remarks, public statements and actions that had led to widespread condemnation and the collapse of several business partnerships.He attributed his behaviour to an undiagnosed frontal-lobe brain injury from a 2002 car accident and to bipolar disorder, describing how prolonged manic episodes caused him to lose touch with reality and exercise poor judgment. Reflecting on his use of Nazi imagery, Ye wrote that in a fractured mental state he “gravitated toward the most destructive symbol I could find, the swastika,” and acknowledged selling T-shirts bearing the symbol.While the letter explicitly stated that he is “not a Nazi or an antisemite” and expressed love for Jewish people, it made no distinction between the Nazi emblem and the ancient religious symbol known as the swastika. That omission became the focal point of the backlash.The Coalition of Hindus of North America (CoHNA) condemned Ye’s wording, calling it “deeply insulting” to Hindus, Buddhists, Jains and other Dharmic communities.The organisation said Ye’s apology repeated a basic historical error: Adolf Hitler did not describe the Nazi symbol as a swastika. The Nazi Party referred to it as the Hakenkreuz, or “hooked cross”. According to CoHNA, equating the two symbols collapses vastly different historical and civilisational contexts into a single narrative of hate.CoHNA also urged The Wall Street Journal to issue a clarification, arguing that publishing the apology without contextual correction allowed a long-debunked misconception to be amplified. While acknowledging Ye’s attempt to apologise for antisemitic harm, the group said accountability must not come at the cost of misrepresenting living religious traditions.The confusion between the swastika and Nazi symbolism is largely the result of early 20th-century Western reporting. As Nazi Germany rose to power, English-language media frequently translated Hakenkreuz as “swastika” for convenience, even though the Nazis themselves did not use that term.Over time, repetition turned that mistranslation into convention. In Western public consciousness, the word “swastika” became almost exclusively associated with Nazism, eclipsing its far older presence across Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, where it symbolises auspiciousness, continuity and well-being.Historians argue that this collapse of meaning distorts history in two directions. Nazi ideology is inaccurately described when its own terminology is ignored, while Dharmic traditions are harmed when their sacred symbols are reduced to shorthand for European fascism. Precision, they say, is essential not only for cultural sensitivity but for historical accuracy.In recent years, Hindu, Buddhist and Jain groups have stepped up efforts to reclaim and contextualise the swastika through education campaigns, interfaith dialogue and legal advocacy. These initiatives aim to explain the difference between the Nazi Hakenkreuz and the religious swastika, particularly in schools, museums and public discourse.Some of these efforts have translated into legislative recognition in parts of North America, where lawmakers have formally acknowledged the distinction between the two symbols. Community leaders stress that reclaiming the swastika is not about downplaying Nazi atrocities, but about preventing an ancient religious emblem from being permanently defined by its 20th-century misuse.For practitioners, the issue is deeply personal. The swastika continues to be used in daily worship, festivals, weddings and rites of passage. Its mischaracterisation shapes public perception and, at times, exposes communities to suspicion or hostility.Ye’s apology illustrates how historical misunderstandings can persist even in moments intended to heal. For Hindu organisations, the issue is not the artist’s intent, but the ease with which a global public figure could repeat an error that scholars and communities have spent decades trying to correct.The episode underscores a broader lesson history offers repeatedly: when symbols are flattened and stripped of context, attempts to confront one injustice can end up creating another. As debates around hate, memory and accountability continue, Hindu groups argue that accuracy is not a technicality. It is the foundation of understanding.","Coalition of Hindus of North America (CoHNA) condemned Ye’s wording, calling it ‘deeply insulting’ to Hindus, Buddhists, Jains and other Dharmic communities.

"Federal agents tackled him, broke his rib: What happened before ICE shot Alex Pretti",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/federal-agents-tackled-him-broke-his-rib-what-happened-before-ice-shot-alex-pretti/articleshow/127649569.cms,"Minneapolis UNSEEN VIDEO: ICE Agents Hit, Pin Down Alex Pretti Before Fatal Shooting | WATCH





Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse who was shot dead by ICE, suffered a broken rib during a previous encounter with federal agents, a week before his death.A memo sent earlier this month to agents temporarily assigned to the city asked them to “capture all images, license plates, identifications, and general information on hotels, agitators, protestors, etc. , so we can capture it all in one consolidated form,” according to correspondence reviewed by CNN.Pretti’s previous encounter reflected the aggressive approach federal agents took with observers and protesters, a philosophy underscored by the request for agents to collect information about protesters whose activities were broadly protected by the First Amendment.The Department of Homeland Security repeatedly warned of threats against federal law enforcement officers during immigration enforcement operations and criticised protesters who they argued impeded those operations. On Tuesday, the department also publicised an online tip form to share information about people allegedly harassing ICE officers.“When our law enforcement encounter a violent agitator who is breaking the law, obstructing law enforcement or assaulting them, our law enforcement make records to advance prosecution. This is not ground breaking, it is standard protocol,” said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a statement.The earlier incident started when Pretti stopped his car after observing ICE agents chasing what he described as a family on foot, and began shouting and blowing his whistle, according to a source who asked not to be named out of fear of retribution.Pretti later told the source that five agents tackled him and one leaned on his back, an encounter that left him with a broken rib. The agents quickly released him at the scene.“That day, he thought he was going to die,” said the source.Pretti was later given medication consistent with treating a broken rib, according to records reviewed by CNN.Earlier this month, a DHS official in Minneapolis sent a memo to Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations officers assigned to the state on temporary duty asking them to use a form to input information on protesters and agitators.The form, titled “intel collection non-arrests”, allowed agents to fill in personal information of agitators and protesters who they encountered. It remained unclear whether other agencies in Minnesota also used the form.Previously, agents informally shared information about protesters and agitators with each other, the memo said.Pretti’s name was known to federal agents, according to a source, though it remained unclear whether the new intake form was used to share his information.It also remained unclear whether the federal agents who encountered Pretti on Saturday recognised him before they confronted him, eventually wrestling him to the ground, taking a gun from his waistband and then fatally shooting him.Some Trump officials spoke publicly about the idea of creating a database of protesters, though it remained unclear what ICE did with the information collected through the form circulated to agents in Minneapolis.","Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse who was shot dead by ICE, suffered a broken rib during a previous encounter with federal agents.

"Wedding horror in Pakistan: 7 killed, 25 injured after suicide bomber targets marriage ceremony",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/wedding-horror-in-pakistan-7-killed-25-injured-after-suicide-bomber-targets-marriage-ceremony/articleshow/127364816.cms,"



A wedding celebration turned into a scene of devastation in Pakistan’s north-west after a suicide bomber blew himself up among guests, killing at least seven people and injuring around 25 others, officials said. The attack took place on Friday night in Dera Ismail Khan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Police said the blast occurred at the home of Noor Alam Mehsud, a pro-government peace committee leader, where a marriage ceremony was under way. Witnesses said guests had been dancing to the beat of drums when the attacker struck, detonating an explosive vest inside a crowded room.District Police Officer Sajjad Ahmed Sahibzada confirmed it was a suicide bombing. The force of the explosion caused part of the roof to collapse, trapping several people under debris and complicating rescue efforts. An emergency was declared at the District Headquarters Hospital as ambulances rushed casualties from the site.Bilal Ahmed Faizi, spokesperson for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Rescue 1122, said multiple ambulances, along with fire and disaster response vehicles, were deployed. Rescue teams worked through the rubble to pull out victims, with some of the wounded reported to be in critical condition.No group immediately claimed responsibility. However, suspicion is likely to fall on Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban, which has carried out frequent attacks in the region. The group is separate from but allied with the Afghan Taliban and has grown more active since the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan in 2021. Many TTP fighters are believed to operate from across the border.Authorities sealed off the area and launched an investigation. Initial reports suggested that Waheedullah Mehsud, also known as Jigri Mehsud, was among those killed.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi condemned the attack and sought a report from the provincial police chief, saying those responsible would be brought to justice. Governor Faisal Karim Kundi also expressed grief and ordered that the injured receive full medical support.","Attack took place in Dera Ismail Khan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

Bar leaders allege violence, warn of protests

What was the case?





Pakistan’s prominent human rights lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, advocate Hadi Ali Chattha, were arrested on Friday while travelling to a court in Islamabad. The incident triggered strong condemnation from legal bodies and rights activists over what they described as unconstitutional move.The lawyer couple was on its way to the Additional District and Sessions Court to appear in a case linked to controversial social media posts when police intercepted their vehicle. Arrest warrants had been issued against them on January 16 after the court cancelled their interim bail, news agency PTI reported.The arrest was confirmed by Imaan’s mother, Dr Shireen Mazari, a former federal human rights minister in the Imran Khan government, who said the couple was detained without explanation and taken to undisclosed locations.In a post on X, Mazari said that her daughter and son-in-law “have been arrested, put in separate cars, and taken away to unknown locations,” adding that no arrest warrant or formal document was shown to them at the time, according to Dawn.Calling the incident a sign of repression, she wrote: “Fascism at its peak. Emasculated men in power must be so pleased with this achievement!”Mazari also shared videos on social media showing police vehicles following the lawyers’ car before blocking it on the road. In the footage, officers were seen opening the car doors, surrounding the vehicle and attempting to pull the occupants out. Another clip showed shattered car windows, which Mazari alleged were broken by the police during the arrest.In a separate post, she claimed that police had used force not only against the couple but also against senior members of the legal fraternity who were accompanying them.“Seems they (police) used violence on Imaan and Hadi also,” Mazari wrote, alleging that the arrest was carried out to prevent further embarrassment to authorities during court proceedings.Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) president Wajid Ali Gilani, who was present at the scene, said the arrest violated assurances given by authorities that the lawyers would be allowed safe passage to court.In a video message shared by Mazari, Gilani said the police attacked the convoy near Serena Chowk, broke car windows, forcibly removed the couple and pushed Imaan into a police vehicle. He also alleged that police officials assaulted IHCBA secretary Manzoor Jajja during the incident.“The authorities should stop this oppression. If they do not, then the 2007 lawyers’ movement will be launched again,” Gilani warned, referring to the mass protests that once challenged military rule in Pakistan.The Islamabad High Court Bar Association, Islamabad Bar Association (IBA) and Islamabad Bar Council (IBC) issued separate statements condemning the arrests, calling them illegal and unconstitutional.The IHCBA and IBA announced a strike on Friday, while the IBC called for a nationwide lawyers’ strike on Saturday. The bar councils demanded the immediate release of the couple and an independent inquiry into the conduct of police officials involved.In a statement, the IBA said the arrest violated fundamental rights guaranteed under Pakistan’s Constitution, stressing that “every citizen has the right to defend themselves in court without fear.”Human Rights Commission of Pakistan strongly condemned the arrest of both lawyers. In a post on X, the organzation wrote: ""HRCP demands immediate disclosure of their whereabouts and holds the authorities fully responsible for any harm. Ms Mazari-Hazir and Mr Chattha must be released immediately.""The primary case against Mazari-Hazir and Chattha stems from a complaint filed in August 2025 with the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), accusing Mazari of spreading content allegedly aligned with banned organisations. Her husband was implicated for reposting some of the content.They were indicted in October last year, and arrest warrants were issued after repeated non-appearances led to the cancellation of their interim bail.Additional cases linked to protests and an alleged scuffle outside the Islamabad High Court have also been filed against them, some of which are still under judicial review.","Iaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, advocate Hadi Ali Chattha, were arrested on Friday while travelling to a court in Islamabad.

Dozens feared missing



Compensation announced for victims’ families







The death toll from a devastating fire at a major shopping plaza in Pakistan’s largest city, Karachi, has risen to 26, with authorities warning that the number could climb further as search operations continue, as reported by Geo TV. The blaze tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market, late on Saturday night, trapping dozens inside.Rescue teams gained fuller access to the building nearly 24 hours later, after firefighters managed to bring the inferno under control. Officials said smoke was still rising from the structure on Monday, complicating efforts to locate missing people.Rescue 1122 Sindh spokesperson Hassan Khan said 21 bodies had been recovered so far, adding that search operations were still under way. “The search will continue,” he said, as concerns remain over possible structural collapses inside the severely damaged building.Mohammed Shah, part of the Pakistan Navy’s rescue team, described the incident as a “deep-seated fire”, noting that smoke continued to emanate from the debris despite the flames being largely extinguished. Firefighters said the blaze had been brought 95 per cent under control, with cooling operations now in progress.Officials warned that the weakened structure posed serious dangers. Portions of the building’s front and back façades have collapsed, while cracks have been detected inside.Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah said authorities were still trying to establish the final death toll. Speaking at a press conference, he said around 65 people who were reported to have visited Gul Plaza remain unaccounted for, raising fears that casualties could rise sharply.“I cannot give a final number as of yet,” he said. “There has been a considerable loss of lives in this incident.”South DIG Syed Asad Raza said more areas of the plaza were yet to be cleared, and warned the number of fatalities could increase as debris is removed.The Sindh government has announced Rs10 million (£28,000) in compensation for the family of each person killed. “There can be no price tag on a life,” the chief minister said, adding that the compensation process would begin immediately.He also confirmed that one firefighter was among those who lost their lives.The cause of the fire has not yet been confirmed. Officials initially suspect an electrical short circuit, though a forensic investigation has been ordered. Police said samples had been collected for DNA matching to help identify victims.Authorities revealed that although the plaza had 16 gates, only three exits were open at the time of the fire, raising serious questions over safety compliance.Karachi has witnessed repeated fatal fires, often linked to poor safety standards, illegal construction and inadequate fire prevention systems. A government audit in 2024 found that the vast majority of commercial buildings in the city lacked proper fire safety measures.","Blaze tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market, late on Saturday night, trapping dozens inside.

Pakistan’s former prime minister Imran Khan has been kept in solitary confinement and barred from meeting his lawyers or family for over three months, his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), said on Monday. The restrictions came after Khan made critical remarks about Pakistan's army chief Marshal Asim Munir, calling him “a mentally unstable person” following a jail meeting with his sister on December 4.Khan, 73, has been incarcerated since August 2023, following his arrest after his government was toppled in April 2022. Multiple cases have been registered against him since then.PTI further said that Khan has been held in solitary confinement, adding that “prolonged solitary confinement is viewed under international law as harmful and potentially constituting cruel, inhuman” treatment when imposed without clear justification or safeguards.The party added that Khan has been completely isolated in a cell and “even the basic necessities guaranteed under the jail manual have been denied to him.”PTI criticised the government for failing to explain why Khan has not been able to meet his lawyers, a constitutional right for any prisoner, let alone a former prime minister. The party demanded “immediate access for Imran Khan's lawyers and family members to him in jail.""The PML-N government initially cited rule violations during visits by Khan’s family and party leaders, then extended the ban until February 8, 2026, citing “national security threats.”After the February 8 general elections in 2024, Khan accused the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) of being “mandate thieves,” alleging they manipulated results to come to power.The PTI has launched multiple demonstrations demanding his release and has announced a major protest on February 8, 2026, against the “stolen mandate” in the general elections.","Imran Khan, 73, has been incarcerated since August 2023, following his arrest after his government was toppled in April 2022.

Karachi Gul Plaza Fire Claims At Least 10 Lives, Dozens Missing As Rescue Operations Continue





The death toll from a major fire at an old shopping mall in Pakistan’s Karachi has risen to 14 after rescue teams recovered eight more bodies from the debris, officials said on Monday.The blaze broke out late Saturday night at Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market on MA Jinnah Road in the city’s Saddar area. The fire was brought under control by Sunday night, but rescue operations continued as large parts of the building suffered severe structural damage.Six bodies were found soon after the fire erupted, with officials saying the victims likely died of suffocation. Dozens of injured people were rushed to nearby hospitals. As the fire spread rapidly, thick smoke and intense heat initially prevented rescue teams from entering the building.“Once the fire was doused, we didn’t wait for the cooling period and forcibly went in to rescue trapped people and we found eight more bodies, some badly charred,” Rescue 1122 Chief Operating Officer Abid Jalal told PTI.Jalal said the fire had almost completely damaged the building, with both the front and rear portions collapsing due to weakened pillars.“The structure has become extremely unsafe, and we are still searching as there is a risk of further collapses,” he said.Gul Plaza, built in the early 1980s, houses around 1,200 shops spread across a basement, mezzanine and three upper floors. It has long been a prominent commercial hub in Karachi.Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, who visited the site on Monday, said authorities feared that dozens of people could still be trapped inside. “We are extremely concerned and alarmed. Efforts are going on to find them but this is a national tragedy,” he told reporters.South Deputy Inspector General of Police Syed Asad Raza said the casualty count could rise as large sections of the building were yet to be searched. Officials suspect an electrical short circuit may have caused the fire, though the exact cause will be confirmed after a full investigation.The incident has once again highlighted serious fire safety concerns in Karachi. In recent years, several commercial buildings in the city have caught fire due to poor safety measures, faulty electrical systems and illegal construction.A government audit in 2024 found that most shopping malls lacked proper fire safety systems, emergency exits and compliant wiring.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari expressed grief over the loss of lives, while the Sindh government has ordered an inquiry into the incident.","The death toll from a major fire at an old shopping mall in Pakistan's Karachi has risen to 14.
