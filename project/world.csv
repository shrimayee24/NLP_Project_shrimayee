The China angle

What Pakistan can do?

Implication for India

As Pakistan grapples with a surge in terrorist strikes in the past couple of years, its restive Balochistan province was rocked this week by a wave of attacks that have left more than 70 dead. The coordinated strikes, perhaps more widespread than any such assault in the past, by the separatist Baloch Liberation Army ( BLA ), have again foregrounded Baloch insurgency fuelled by decades of neglect and exploitation of impoverished Balochistan's natural resources as the soft underbelly of Pakistan.The attacks, which saw BLA targeting police stations and taking control of major highways, coincided with the death anniversary of Baloch leader Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti, who was killed 18 years ago in one of then president Pervez Musharraf's counter-insurgency operations.Bugti's killing only exposed the limitation of kinetic action, in the absence of any genuine attempt to address the aspirations of the tribal population, as it led to the emergence of more armed separatist groups that now target not just Pakistan security forces and Chinese interests but also Punjabi and Sindhi migrant workers.There's no doubt that the attacks were on a newer scale and showed increased audacity of the insurgents, their strong support base and increasing ability to operate freely.According to former Indian high commissioner to Pakistan, Ajay Bisaria, targeting of Punjabi workers introduces a new ethnic dimension, signalling that the Baloch radicals are looking to provoke and challenge the primarily Punjabi army.Nearly half of those killed by the BLA in the latest escalation were Punjabi workers. The Baloch people resent the influx of Punjabis who are seen as having benefited from economic opportunities arising in Balochistan at the expense of the Baloch people. This has fed into the insurgency against the Pakistan state and the anti-Punjabi sentiment that sustains it. The sentiment has its genesis in the traditional domination of the Punjabi elite in the civil bureaucracy and the composition of the Punjabi-dominated army, which lords over the province in the absence of any genuine political leadership or effort to address the local grievances.To an average Baloch, who believes he has the first claim over the province's natural resources and sees himself as a victim of the federal government's discriminatory policies, Punjabi workers only symbolise State repression, as practiced by the essentially Punjabi establishment. Extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, human rights violations and the reluctance of the establishment to engage civil rights groups have added to the mistrust.According to Bisaria, the latest episode also represents a security meltdown and possibly a coalescing of the Afghan/ Pashtun and Baloch insurgencies. TTP (Pakistan Taliban) and BLA are coordinating, if not colluding. Unsurprisingly, India is being accused of being involved in the latest and previous attacks,'' he says.Islamabad has repeatedly blamed India for providing financial support to the secessionists and Iran of allowing them safe hideouts. India has officially maintained these allegations don't merit any serious consideration and that Pakistan must introspect its own support to terrorism.Pakistan remains under attack from the TTP in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and the army has been worried for the past few years about a developing nexus between Baloch separatists and the TTP in Balochistan, which is home to a sizeable Pashtun population as well. TTP has cheered attacks by Baloch militants, accused Pakistan army of carrying out massacres in Balochistan and said groups like BLA and TTP have a common enemy. BLA has been designated as a terrorist group by both the US and UK.Not surprisingly, China was quick to condemn the attacks, saying it's prepared to enhance counterterrorism and security cooperation with Pakistan to jointly uphold regional peace and security. Pakistan's hopes of turning the resource-rich Balochistan, its largest and most backward province, into an economic and energy hub have hinged on the BRI's flagship $60 billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). The CPEC projects, however, have been marred by violent insurgency.CPEC facilities, along with Chinese engineers and workers, have been targeted by the BLA and other insurgent groups that accuse China of arming Pakistan against Baloch separatists and of working with Islamabad to exploit the natural resources of the province, while aiding the marginalisation of the local people. Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif accused the separatists of working to scuttle the CPEC in his remarks on the latest attacks. With the BLA displaying greater operational capacity in the form of multiple attacks across the province, the CPEC, including the centrepiece Gwadar port, will remain vulnerable to the threat of violence.Balochistan, which accounts for more than 40% of Pakistan's land mass but only 6% of the population, has a long history of political unrest, as insurgency seeking a separate Baloch state dates to the time of independence. Economic oppression, anti-Punjabi sentiment, enforced disappearances, extrajudicial killings and the plain inacceptance of the idea of Baloch nationalism have all contributed to the insurgency that is now jostling with traditionally more high-profile issues like Pakistan's role in Afghanistan for international limelight.In the interest of regional, particularly its own, stability, Pakistan must find a way to politically address the Baloch discontent, instead of subjugating the local population with its militarist approach. To begin with, it must look into their grievances, particularly exploitation of resources which remains a sensitive issue. Insurgency has been boosted by the perception among the local people that they are being denied benefits of the exploration of Balochistan's considerable mineral resources.While the army for now remains formidable enough to prevent any potential Balkanisation of Pakistan, it must encourage the federal government to enter a meaningful dialogue with the Baloch nationalists to mitigate violence and look at ways to finding a long-term solution, despite the seemingly intractable nature of the conflict. The Baloch people, with their distinct identity, have traditionally been seen as secular and it's in Pakistan's interest to ensure they don't work with groups like the TTP which are driven by extremist religious ideology.Pakistan also has to find a way to engage civil rights groups like the Baloch Yakjehti Committee that want to peacefully raise issues like enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings.Pakistan will continue to accuse India of funding the BLA. In the past, it has justified crackdown on the separatists by talking up their alleged links with the enemy''. India will of course closely follow how the Pakistan army reacts to the Baloch escalation, as it guards against any attempt to disrupt the assembly polls in J&K. There has been a series of recent terror attacks in Jammu, leading PM Narendra Modi to warn Pakistan against using terrorism or proxy war against India. India believes Pakistan must introspect why attacks have increased in both Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan since the return of Afghan Taliban to Kabul, a development that Pakistan thought portended the return of its strategic depth in Afghanistan.","Baloch insurgency fuelled by decades of neglect and exploitation of impoverished Balochistan's natural resources.

Travel disruptions

and preemptive measures

Storm continues to impact central Japan

Ongoing effects of Shanshan despite weakening

Thousands of people have been asked to evacuate Tokyo as tropical storm Shanshan continues its northward march across Japan . Since making landfall as a typhoon on Thursday, Shanshan has caused the deaths of six people and left dozens injured, becoming one of the most powerful storms to hit the country's southwest in decades, reported the Independent.An 80-year-old man and a man who was trapped under a fallen roof are the latest to be reported dead due to the storm while three people were killed in landslides.The storm is moving slowly northeast at a speed of 10km/h and is expected to reach Tokyo by the weekend.The storm made its way to Central Japan on Saturday after wreaking havoc near Kunisaki in Oita Prefecture the previous day, with maximum sustained wind speeds of 72km/h and gusts reaching up to 108km/h. Some areas have already experienced record rainfall, leading to concerns over flooding and swollen rivers.Three rivers in Tokyo namely Meguro, Nogawa, and Sengawa are under a Level 4 warning issued by the weather agency. Several train lines are still affected and many cities remain underemergency alerts .Shanshan has caused significant travel disruptions in Japan. Dozens of flights have been cancelled and airlines are organising alternative flights for stranded passengers. In the southwest of the country, the storm left behind a broken bridge, as well as layers of mud and branches scattered on roads.The Tokaido bullet train service was halted between Nagoya and Mishima as the area is projected to be most affected by the storm. Other local trains are also running on delayed schedules.Local authorities had preemptively shut down large parts of the island of Kyushu, warning that the storm could be one of the strongest ever to hit the region. As Shanshan made landfall on the southwestern island of Kyushu early on Thursday, it brought winds gusting up to almost 200 km/h.Shanshan made its way into central Japan on Saturday. It resulted in the halting of trains and leaving underground passages brimming with water. Officials warned of torrential rains in major cities, including Osaka and Tokyo.The storm, packing winds of up to 65 kilometres per hour, crawled past the southwestern island of Shikoku and travelled over the southern part of the main Honshu island at a speed of 15 km/ph by late afternoon.

legislation

Concerns over inconsistent marijuana laws

Impact on voter mobilisation and Republican division

Former President Trump has suggested he might support a Florida ballot measure to legalise recreational marijuana for adults, known as Amendment 3 , reported the Hill.Trump, a Florida resident, emphasised the importance of this measure being appropriately managed by the state Legislature to avoid public consumption issues.“In Florida, like so many other States that have already given their approval, personal amounts of marijuana will be legalised for adults with Amendment 3,” Trump said in a post on his Truth Social site.“Whether people like it or not, this will happen through the approval of the Voters , so it should be done correctly.”Trump avoided stating his voting intention or openly backing marijuana legalisation but stressed that responsible legislation is necessary to avoid public nuisances. He pointed to the need for laws that prevent marijuana use in public areas to keep public spaces free from the smell of marijuana, similar to the issues observed in other cities.“The state Legislature needs to responsibly create laws that prohibit marijuana consumption in public spaces so we do not smell marijuana everywhere we go, like we do in many of the Democrat-run Cities,” said Trump.He also highlighted the inconsistency of criminalising marijuana possession in Florida when it is legal in many other states. Trump emphasised that law enforcement resources and lives should not be wasted on arresting adults for possessing small amounts of marijuana.“We do not need to ruin lives & waste Taxpayer Dollars arresting adults with personal amounts of it on them, and no one should grieve a loved one because they died from fentanyl-laced marijuana,” he added.Trump’s comments follow recent efforts by Democrats to attract younger voters in Florida, focusing on issues like abortion and marijuana legalisation. These issues have mobilised younger voters in other regions, as seen in Ohio, and Democrats hope for a similar impact in Florida.Democrats are targeting the fall ballot measures, aiming to increase voter turnout and gain the support of younger voters, a group with which Trump has faced challenges.Earlier in the year, the Department of Justice made a significant move toward reclassifying marijuana as a less dangerous drug. If this reclassification is approved, marijuana will be downgraded to a Schedule III drug.Despite the trend toward normalisation and Trump's comments, some Republicans remain opposed to legalising recreational marijuana. Sen Rick Scott has publicly stated his intention to vote against the measure. He cited personal family experience with addiction as a key reason for his opposition.""My brother, who died at 67 in April, began smoking marijuana as a teenager and led a life of addiction,"" Scott said.",Former President Trump has suggested he might support a Florida ballot measure to legalise recreational marijuana for adults.

Officials earlier in the day had said the plane was carrying two people and that at least one resident had been unaccounted for.Photos and videos published by KGW-TV in Portland showed one of the townhomes engulfed in flames while black smoke poured out of the adjoining houses.Gresham Fire Chief Scott Lewis said the fire had spread to at least four of the homes, displacing up to six families. He said two people were treated at the scene, but he didn't describe the type or severity of injuries.The Federal Aviation Administration identified the aircraft as a twin-engine Cessna 421C, which it says went down around 10:30 am near Troutdale Airport, about a 30-minute drive east of Portland.As the plane went down, it knocked over a pole and power lines, causing a separate brush fire in a nearby field, according to the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office. The plane was split into multiple parts as it crashed in the residential area in the city of Fairview, which is home to about 10,000 people.Lewis said the first call about the fire came from staff at the Troutdale Airport's control tower, who saw a thick plume of smoke rising in the air. But Lewis said that initial reports indicated ""there was no mayday, no call for emergency"" from the aircraft itself before it crashed.The National Transportation Safety Board is leading the investigation into the crash. The agency has sent two investigators to the site of the crash who will document the wreckage, spokesperson Peter Knudson said. He did not release further details about the crash.The website for the Port of Portland, which oversees general aviation and marine operations in the Portland area, describes Troutdale Airport as a ""flight training and recreational airport"".","Small plane crashes into a row of townhouses east of Portland, setting the homes ablaze.

US Army confirms cemetery incident

Trump defends his actions at a rally

Ongoing controversy with the military

Vice president Kamala Harris hit out at former President Donald Trump and his campaign for disrespecting a ""sacred ground, all for the sake of a political stunt."" Taking a dig at the former president's visit to the Arlington National Cemetery , Kamala Harris took to X and said that was a ""place where we come together to honor American heroes"" and ""not for politics.""""If there is one thing on which we as Americans can all agree, it is that our veterans , military families, and service members should be honoured, never disparaged, and treated with nothing less than our highest respect and gratitude,"" Harris wrote.The first comments from the vice president on this come after it was reported that an altercation erupted between a female cemetery official and a Trump staffer earlier this week. Trump took part in a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier to commemorate three years since the US withdrawal from Afghanistan . He was joined by Gold Star families whose family members died.Harris strongly criticised Trump for breaking cemetery rules barring photography for political purposes. Trump's campaign shared images showing him grinning and giving a thumbs-up among headstones, which Harris termed a disrespect to sacred ground.""Let me be clear: the former president disrespected sacred ground, all for the sake of a political stunt,"" Harris said.In a statement issued on Thursday, the US Army confirmed a staff member at the cemetery was ""abruptly pushed aside"" after asking Trump's team to stop filming in a restricted area. This section is reserved for those killed in recent wars, where photography for political purposes is banned.The Trump campaign described the employee as a ""despicable individual"" and claimed she was experiencing a mental health episode. However, the military stated that the staff member had acted with professionalism and condemned the incident as ""unfortunate.""Trump addressed the matter at a rally in Johnstown , Pennsylvania, arguing it was the families of fallen troops who asked for their photo with him.""I said 'Absolutely.' I wasn't doing it for -- I don't need publicity, I get a lot of publicity. I would like to get a lot less publicity,"" Trump said.He blamed the White House for the criticism, asserting it was due to the handling of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. Joe Biden killed those young people because he was incompetent. And then they tell me that I used their graves for public relations purposes. And I didn't. And I'll tell you what, it was a disgrace,"" Trump said.Trump visited the cemetery with families of 13 service members who died in a 2021 bombing in Kabul during the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. His campaign has emphasised that he would have managed the withdrawal better, making it a key point against the Biden-Harris administration.Trump's relations with the military have often been controversial. While he frequently praised the armed forces, he reportedly mocked war dead and avoided being seen near military amputees, according to his former chief of staff.Harris's response on Saturday underscored her readiness to confront Trump in what is expected to be a bruising election.Trump has mocked Harris's name, intelligence, appearance, and racial identity. In response, the Harris campaign has described Trump as ""weird,"" an aspiring dictator, and ""out of his mind.""Trump's running mate, Senator JD Vance, had earlier criticised Harris, responding to a mistaken report that she had already commented on the cemetery visit.""She can go to hell,"" Vance said.""Don't focus on Donald Trump showing up to grieve with some people who lost their children. Focus on your own job. Don't do this fake outrage thing,"" Vance later told the Washington Post.At that time, Harris had not publicly mentioned the cemetery visit.Kevin Carroll, a former senior aide to Trump's homeland security chief John Kelly, sharply criticized Trump's actions in an opinion piece for The Guardian.""The photo of a grinning Trump giving a jaunty thumbs-up over these patriots' graves is an indelible image of narcissism risen to the point of sociopathy,"" Carroll wrote.","Kamala Harris hits out at former President Donald Trump and his campaign for disrespecting a ""sacred ground, all for the sake of a political stunt"" Trump took part in a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier to commemorate three years since the US withdrawal from Afghanistan.

The aircraft had successfully intercepted several Russian cruise missiles before disaster struck.According to Ukraine's military, communication with Mes's jet was suddenly lost amid the fierce battle. The wreckage was later discovered, confirming the worst: Mes had given his life in defense of his country.Ukraine's military has opened an investigation into the crash, with early reports suggesting that pilot error or mechanical failure may have been the cause, rather than enemy fire, according to the report by NYT.Mes had been part of Ukraine's air force since the early days of the conflict. His death has sent shockwaves through the country, with many seeing it as a significant blow to both the military and national morale.The F-16s, which arrived in Ukraine just weeks ago, were seen as a crucial component in the country’s defense strategy, and Mes was among the first to be trained to fly them.The crash occurred during what President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described as one of the largest Russian attacks since the invasion began.Over 200 missiles and drones were fired at Ukrainian targets, and Mes, along with his fellow pilots, was at the forefront of the defense effort. Despite the intense barrage, the F-16s had ""demonstrated their high efficiency,"" according to Ukraine’s general staff, shooting down multiple threats.

The post captured the deep sorrow felt across the country, as well as the profound respect for Mes’s sacrifice.The pilot’s death comes at a critical time for Ukraine, as the country faces relentless pressure from Russian forces in the east. Mes’s passing is a stark reminder of the human cost of the war and the high stakes involved as Ukraine continues its fight for survival. While the F-16s represent hope for a stronger defense, the loss of a pilot like Oleksiy Mes underscores the ongoing peril and the sacrifices being made on the front lines.As the nation mourns, Mes’s legacy as a fearless pilot and a symbol of Ukraine's resilience will continue to inspire those who carry on the fight.
