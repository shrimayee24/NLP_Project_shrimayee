NEW DELHI: The United States Supreme Court on Friday rejected the extradition stay request of Tahawwur Rana , a key accused in the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks that killed more than 170 people.Rana had approached the US Supreme Court , seeking an emergency stay on his previously allowed extradition.In the appeal application, Rana contended that his survival chances would be insufficient for facing trial in India, citing multiple factors.His petition specifically mentioned that ""if a stay is not entered, there will be no review at all, and the US courts will lose jurisdiction, and the petitioner will soon be dead.""The 26/11 terror attacks suspect alleged that his extradition to India would likely lead to his torture, given his status as a Pakistani-origin Muslim individual.Rana's extradition was greenlit by US President Donald Trump last month.During a joint press conference at the White House with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Trump had announced the decision and suggested additional extraditions would follow.""We are giving a very violent man (Tahawwur Rana) back to India immediately. There are more to follow because we have quite a few requests.

Omar to Centre: Reclaim PoK but also get back areas in Chinese grip,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/omar-to-centre-reclaim-pok-but-also-get-back-areas-in-chinese-grip/articleshow/118768785.cms,"Photo/ANI

JAMMU: J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah questioned Thursday the BJP-led Centre’s “silence” on swathes of the region under Chinese control. The National Conference (NC) mascot did so while referring to external affairs minister S Jaishankar’s recent statement about reclaiming Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).“The foreign minister has said they will bring back the portion of Kashmir controlled by Pakistan. Did we ever stop them? If they can bring it back, they should do it now. But why no talks on China? Why does the (Union) govt only focus on PoK while ignoring Chinese control over parts of J&K,” the CM said in the assembly during a debate.Jaishankar had made the comments on Wednesday in London in response to a Pakistani scribe’s query, saying the Kashmir issue would be solved when the “stolen part of Kashmir, which is under illegal Pakistani occupation” was returned.Omar pointed out, however, that “one part is with Pakistan, and another is with China”, asking why the Centre didn’t talk about taking back the portions under Beijing’s grip. The CM mentioned further that the Kargil war of 1999 was a good opportunity for the Centre to take back POK, but was missed. “It’s okay that it could not be done then, but if you can reclaim it today, then who among us will say don’t get it back?” Omar asked.Omar came down heavily on BJP leaders for accusing his NC of insulting J&K’s last ruler Maharaja Hari Singh and challenged them to give just one instance when the ruling party or any other Kashmir-based party insulted the Dogra ruler, even as he accused BJP of downgrading the Muslim-majority state.The CM renewed his criticism of the 2019 abrogation of statehood and division into two parts -- J&K and Ladakh. “Maharaja Bahadur (rulers of Princely State) gave you a map of J&K as a legacy. You (the Centre) divided the map of J&K into two parts and now you say this is what the people of Ladakh wanted. Did you ask the people of Ladakh what they wanted?” Omar asked.The CM explained why return of statehood was necessary. “I am not fighting for statehood for myself, this fight is in J&K’s interest. The things we want to do can be given practical shape only when we get back statehood,” Omar said.",J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah questioned the Centre’s “silence’ on swathes of the region under Chinese control.

NEW DELHI: Former Rajasthan chief minister and senior Congress leader Ashok Gehlot on Thursday called his party colleague Mani Shankar Aiyar a frustrated "" sarfira ."" Reacting strongly to Aiyar's remarks questioning the competency of late Rajiv Gandhi, Gehlot said: ""His statements about Rajiv Gandhi reflect the height of frustration. There is so much frustration in him. In such a situation, a person does not know what he is saying. Only a 'sarfira' can say such a thing about Rajiv Gandhi.""Calling Aiyar's comments condemnable, Gehlot said Rajiv Gandhi increased India's prestige abroad as the Prime Minister and claimed that exemplary laws were passed during his tenure.On Wednesday, Congress leader Harish Rawat had called Aiyar a ""frustrated individual."" ""I don't want to comment on someone who is a frustrated individual...I knew Rajiv Gandhi, who gave the country a modern outlook. He took concrete steps for the liberalisation of the economy as well. Unfortunately, a section of the party (Congress) did not stand with him, or else the country's history would have been something else. His speeches as LoP still guide leaders,"" Rawat had said.Nana Patole, former Maharashtra Congress chief had slammed Aiyar for digging out uncomfortable details about the former PM who left the world long ago. “He has lost his mental balance, he should get himself examined,” Patole had said yesterday.Congress leaders have unleashed an offensive against Aiyar after BJP leader Amit Malviya shared a video on his official 'X' handle in which former Union minister is heard questioning former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's education.In the video, Aiyar is heard saying that despite failing at Cambridge, where passing is considered relatively easy, he went on to attend Imperial College London, only to face failure again.Also read: 'How could someone who failed twice become PM?': Mani Shankar Aiyar's shocker on Rajiv Gandhi; Cong calls him 'frustrated leader' ""Rajiv Gandhi struggled academically, even failing at Cambridge, where passing is relatively easy.

Let the veil be stripped"", Amit Malviya captioned his post on 'X.This is not the first time that Aiyar has landed the Congress in trouble with his remarks. There have been several instances in the past when Aiyar has embarrassed the Congress by speaking out of turn. His remarks mocking PM Modi's past as a tea seller in 2014 gave the BJP a weapon to brand Congress as an elitist party. He later made another derogatory remark against the Prime Minister leading to his suspension from the party. However, his recent remarks against the Gandhis don't appear to be unintentional.Aiyar had recently claimed that his career was both made and unmade by the Gandhis. In an interview to news agency PTI, Aiyar had mentioned that aside from one occasion, he had limited meaningful interactions with Rahul Gandhi , and he had only spent time with Priyanka Gandhi on two occasions.“For 10 years, I was not given an opportunity to meet Sonia Gandhi one-on-one. I was not given an opportunity, except once, of spending any meaningful time with Rahul Gandhi. And I have not spent time with Priyanka except on one occasion, no, two occasions. She comes on the phone to me, so I’m in touch with them.

MUMBAI: A dinner treat turned into a misadventure for Kurla's Shaikh family. On Feb 3, Ruby Shaikh (name changed), a 34-year-old mother of two, was enjoying a rare treat - chicken biryani from a local restaurant. Little did she know that a chicken bone would take her on a month-long medical journey that would perplex even doctors.The modestly priced biryani left Ruby's husband, a supervisor in a local factory, with an Rs 8 lakh bill, although the hospital later halved it through donations.The 3.2cm bone that damaged Ruby's oesophagus was extracted on Feb 8. But when doctors at Criticare Asia Hospital began the throat procedure, it vanished from its initial position. X-ray and ultrasound examinations couldn't find it in the chest or abdomen. A CT scan, performed while the patient was intubated, revealed its unexpected upward movement to the nasopharynx, the topmost part of the throat. The operation lasted eight hours instead of two.Immediately after choking on Feb 3, Ruby arrived at Criticare Hospital where an X-ray scan showed a foreign object in her neck. She refused CT scans and admission but returned two days later with fever, high blood pressure, and oral infection. This time, through endoscopy and CT scans, doctors found the foreign body in the cervical oesophagus, having caused bilateral perforations.ENT surgeon Dr Sanjay Helale said, ""Scans before surgery revealed the bone was still in the earlier position."" He chose an open surgery as the bone was close to the carotid artery to the brain and the patient's perforated food pipe needed repair. ""Perhaps due to manipulations of the oesophagus during dissection or the effect of anaesthesia, the bone moved upward.""Dr Ajay Bhandarwar, head of the surgery dept at J J Hospital, said the movement from the food pipe back to the throat was unusual.Former KEM Hospital Dean Dr Avinash Supe suggested: ""One can presume the patient coughed immediately after anaesthesia was given and necrosis set in the infected tissues loosened the bone, resulting in upward migration.""Ruby, meanwhile, says she will neither eat nor cook biryani.","The 3.2cm bone that damaged Ruby's oesophagus was extracted on Feb 8.

Tahawwur Rana extradition delayed as Pakistan sacrifices alleged Abbey Gate bomber to US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tahawwur-rana-extradition-delayed-as-pakistan-sacrifices-alleged-abbey-gate-bomber-to-us/articleshow/118766674.cms,"TOI Correspondent from Washington

: Citing possible torture and execution by Indian authorities, Tahawwur Rana, a former Pakistani Army veteran involved in the 26/11 terror attack on Mumbai, has filed an emergency appeal before the US Supreme Court seeking a stay on his extradition to India, even as Islamabad handed over to the US another terrorist wanted by Washington.Seeking an emergency stay of his imminent extradition already announced by President Trump during Prime Minister Modi's recent visit to Washington, Rana's attorneys on Wednesday cited a UK case (Sanjay Bhandari v Government of India) in which a London court denied extradition on similar grounds, because there was ""a real risk of his being subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.""Also read: 'Will soon be dead': 26/11 accused Tahawwur Rana tells US court he'll be tortured if extradited to India The US Supreme Court had previously rejected on January 21 Rana's review petition to stay the extradition, but his attorneys returned to the apex court this week to file a last-ditch emergency appeal arguing that if extradited to India, he faces a high likelihood of torture due to his identity as a Muslim of Pakistani origin, his former status as a Pakistani Army member, and his chronic health conditions.""Rana now faces the prospect of transfer to a country where his birthplace (Pakistan), his religion (Muslim), and the nature of the charges (terrorist murder of 166 people) mark him for likely abuse--followed, if he survives pretrial incarceration, by a trial with a predictable result and execution by hanging, per India Code of Criminal Procedure § 354(5),"" his attorneys said.In a supplement to the emergency application for stay before SC Associate Justice Elena Kagan, they appended the UK case reference where Sanjay Bhandari won reprieve to face charges of money laundering and tax evasion, although Rana faces terrorism-related charges.""The Bhandari decision demonstrates that petitioner’s fears of being subjected to torture, likely to result in death, are well-founded as evidenced by the U.K. courts’ refusal to extradite to India an individual charged merely with financial crimes unaccompanied by any high-profile, overarching religious, ethnic, or national considerations that would make the individual a particular focus of scorn or animus,"" Rana's attorneys argued.The Supreme Court has taken this application on record, but a hearing date is yet to be set, delaying an extradition that Trump himself confirmed on February 13 at a joint press conference with Modi. The case has now dragged on for almost four years with the accused delaying his extradition with legal stratagems that would have cost him hundreds of thousands of dollars.The latest ploy came hours after Pakistan extradited to the US Mohammed Shareefullah, an alleged terrorist the Trump administration said is wanted in the Abbey Gate attack in Kabul which killed 13 American personnel and 170 Afghans.While Trump himself mentioned the handover in his joint address to Congress on Tuesday -- saying ""he is right now on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice,” -- to highlight his administration's resolve, a former CIA officer claimed Shareefullah had nothing to do with the Abbey Gate attack, which she said was masterminded by Sirajuddin Haqqani and Sanaullah Ghafari.""So why was a fake mastermind detained and extradited to the U.S.—and who is telling our American President@realdonaldtrump it was someone else?"" Sarah Adams, a self-described CIA alum who tracks terrorism issues in the region asked in post on X. Indian sources believe Pakistan is trying to delay the extradition of one of its military alums given the precedent it would set, by throwing Shareefullah under the bus.In a Fox News interview, CIA Director John Ratcliff, a Trump loyalist, revealed that was on the phone on his second day in office with his ISI counterpart to underscore the need for cooperation on the issue of terrorism. Ratcliffe himself -- accompanied by FBI Director Kash Patel and DNI chief Tulsi Gabbardm went to the airport to oversee the Shareefullah handover.Soon after Shareefullah's extradition, Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif thanked Trump ""for acknowledging and appreciating Pakistan's role and support in counter terrorism efforts across the region, in the context of Pakistan Security Forces’ recent apprehension of ISKP’s top tier operational commander Shareefullah, who is an Afghanistan National.""""As is well-known, Pakistan has always played a critical role in counter terrorism efforts aimed at denying safe havens to terrorists and militant groups the space to operate against any other country. We remain steadfast in our resolve and unwavering commitment to combating terrorism, in all its forms and manifestations,"" he added.Such commitment evidently does not extend to India.","Tahawwur Rana, a former Pakistani Army veteran involved in the 26/11 terror attack on Mumbai, has filed an emergency appeal before the US Supreme Court seeking a stay on his extradition to India.

The alleged murderer, who has inexplicably become a thirst-trap icon online, is now at the center of a scandal that has Twitter (or X, as it’s now called) in an absolute frenzy.The wild claims were first reported by Radar, which cited an unnamed source who described the supposed tapes as ""cinema-level quality"" with ""perfect lighting.""

Fans camped outside his most recent court hearing, gushing over his ""haunting stare"" and ""intellectual aura."" Now, the alleged tapes have only added fuel to the fire.The rumor mill exploded, with users either searching desperately for the so-called tapes or outright mocking the hysteria. One viral post, dripping with sarcasm, read: ""Luigi Mangione sex tapes dropped… disgusting… horrible… can’t believe we’re objectifying him… send me the link pls."" Another joked: ""Me at work casually searching for Luigi Mangione sex tape.""Despite the obsession, some users aren’t buying it. A resurfaced New York Times interview with a former roommate of Mangione claimed he had severe physical pain that prevented him from having sex. This has only deepened the mystery—how could a man who allegedly couldn’t have sex have filmed dozens of tapes?Mangione has remained silent on the rumors, though his legal defense team previously released a statement thanking his growing fanbase for their ""overwhelming support.""

The United Kingdom's security for the foreign ministers became a question after external affairs minister S Jaishankar was attacked by ""Khalistani thugs"" in London. Raising the issue in the House of Commons Conservative Party MP Bob Blackman said that this incident is an affront to democracy, to friends and allies in India.Blackman also urged for measures to prevent such incidents and requested the House Leader to ensure appropriate ministerial statements regarding visitor protection protocols.While addressing the House, Blackman said, ""Yesterday, external affairs minister from India, Sri S Jaishankar, was attacked when he was leaving a public venue when he'd been addressing an audience of Indian people in this country. He was attacked by Khalistani thugs. This is against the Geneva Convention and it appears that the police and the security forces failed to ensure that he was made safe. Now, this is an affront to democracy, it's an affront to our friends and allies in India, and we need to make sure that it doesn't happen again.""""So will the leader ensure that the Home Secretary or appropriate minister makes a statement to this House about what protection we're going to make sure when we have external visitors to this country that they are safe,"" he added.Labour's House Leader Lucy Powell apologised for the incident that happened with EAM Jaishankar and said that this is not how UK wanted the visitors to be treated.Powell said, ""I am really sorry to hear about the attack, the very serious attack, it sounds like, on a visitor to this country from the Indian Parliament.

How did the clash unfold?



What’s happening now?



Assad’s fall and its aftermath



More than 70 people were killed and dozens wounded on Friday in violent clashes between Syrian security forces and gunmen loyal to deposed ruler Bashar al-Assad in the coastal province of Latakia, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR).""More than 70 killed and dozens wounded and captured in bloody clashes and ambushes on the Syrian coast between members of the Ministry of Defence and Interior and militants from the defunct regime's army,"" the monitor said in a post on X.The violence erupted in Jableh, a town in Latakia province, as security forces launched operations to root out Assad loyalists who have regrouped in the mountainous coastal region.Earlier reports had put the death toll at 48, with SOHR describing the fighting as the ""most violent"" since Assad was ousted by Islamist rebels in December. The dead included 16 security personnel and 28 pro-Assad fighters, while others were wounded or captured.The clashes reportedly began when gunmen linked to an Assad-era commander, Suhail al-Hassan , attacked security patrols and checkpoints. In response, government forces launched helicopter strikes on a village in Latakia.“The armed groups that our security forces were clashing with in the Latakia countryside were affiliated with the war criminal Suhail al-Hassan, who committed the most heinous massacres against the Syrian people,” Latakia's security director Lieutenant Colonel Mustafa Kunaifati told state news agency SANA.Al-Hassan, nicknamed “The Tiger”, was a key military commander under Assad, leading special forces in major battles against the rebels in 2015. His hometown, Beit Ana, became a focal point of the latest tensions after residents reportedly disrupted security forces during an operation to arrest an arms dealer.Security forces have been deployed in and around Jableh to restore order. Reports indicate that Alawite community leaders have accused the government of targeting peaceful protesters in the helicopter strikes. The Alawites, Assad’s sectarian base, largely backed him during his rule but are now caught in the turmoil following his downfall.SANA, citing defence ministry sources, confirmed that reinforcements have been sent to the Jableh region to bring the situation under control.The latest violence is part of Syria’s ongoing instability following the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in December 2024. His ouster, led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) rebels, marked the end of his 24-year rule and the Assad family’s five-decade hold on power.In the final hours before Damascus fell to the rebels, Assad fled the country in secrecy, misleading his aides about Russian military support.""He told his commanders and associates after his Moscow trip that military support was coming,"" said Hadi al-Bahra, the head of Syria’s main opposition abroad. ""He was lying to them. The message he received from Moscow was negative.""As his government collapsed, security forces abandoned their posts, allowing rebels to seize control of Damascus. Assad’s brother Maher and other key regime figures also fled, while some were ambushed by rebel fighters.Since Assad’s departure, the HTS-led insurgents have promised an inclusive government, but concerns remain over their Islamist ties.","Violence erupted in Jableh, a town in Latakia province, as security forces launched operations to root out Assad loyalists.

The money would need to be posted in advance as a bond.Judges are not obligated to grant these requests, but if they do, plaintiffs could be forced to provide significant sums before proceeding with their lawsuits.""Federal courts should hold litigants accountable for their misrepresentations and ill-granted injunctions,"" Trump stated in the order, accusing “activist organizations” of securing improper and excessive legal blocks against his administration’s policies.The directive comes in response to more than 100 lawsuits filed against Trump's efforts to downsize the federal bureaucracy, cut government spending, and reshape immigration and social policies. While the administration has faced legal setbacks, it has also secured some victories in recent weeks.Government lawyers have already sought bonds in multiple cases, including one challenging Trump’s freeze on $3 trillion in federal loans, grants, and financial aid. However, U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan rejected the request, stating it would ""defy logic"" to ""hold plaintiffs hostage"" with a bond.

Ukraine was once the world’s 3rd largest nuclear power on Earth—here's why it gave them up,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ukraine-was-once-the-worlds-3rd-largest-nuclear-power-on-earthheres-why-it-gave-them-up/articleshow/118759795.cms,"Ukraine’s bold decision to give up nuclear weapons

Ukraine’s security dilemma amid growing Russian aggression

After the fall of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, Ukraine was left with one of the world's largest nuclear stockpiles. The third-largest nuclear power, it inherited around 5,000 nuclear weapons, including intercontinental missiles that could deliver thermonuclear warheads. After having this powerful arsenal, Ukraine took the unprecedented step of relinquishing its nuclear weapons according to the ET reports. This decision, as it determined the fate of the nation, would go on to set the stage for future conflict with Russia.The denuclearization decision of Ukraine was made on the basis of myriad considerations. Although the nation had physically possessed the weapons, it hadn't possessed the control to utilize them. Russia, possessing the launch codes and control systems, possessed control over the weapons. It rendered Ukraine's nuclear arsenal meaningless as a deterrent since they couldn't utilize them by themselves.In addition, having such a large nuclear arsenal was financially unsustainable for the newly independent state of Ukraine, which was only just stabilizing its economy. The financial burden of keeping, securing, and possibly controlling operation of the weapons was too great, and to attempt to do so would have been likely to precipitate a diplomatic crisis with Russia and the West. Geopolitical risks and economic costs dissuaded Ukraine from giving up its nuclear arsenal.In response to international pressure to proliferate nuclear weapons, in 1991 the United States launched the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) program, funding and technical assistance to enable former Soviet republics to dismantle nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. International pressure to dismantle nuclear stockpiles in former Soviet republics, including Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine, resulted in the creation of the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) Program in 1991.Ukraine, despite all this, in 1994 signed the Budapest Memorandum, a significant treaty, in which the United Kingdom, Russia, and the United States guaranteed Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity in return for its giving up nuclear weapons. The treaty also guaranteed that these countries would not threaten or use military action against Ukraine and would call for UN action in the case of Ukraine being threatened at any time.Whereas initially the Budapest Memorandum was welcomed as a monumental step toward global nuclear disarmament, assurances laid out in the agreement began to lose legitimacy with shifts in political loyalties. Academics had long advised, nonetheless, that the preservation of nuclear weapons by Ukraine was required to protect from probable Russian attack, since Ukraine being geopolitically situated half-way between Russia and Europe. These concerns increasingly caught momentum since Vladimir Putin's return to the presidency.Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its backing of the separatists in eastern Ukraine dispelled any illusions about the validity of the Budapest Memorandum. While the memorandum was supposed to provide guarantees, Russia's move proved that commitments by nuclear powers can be unilaterally renounced with impunity. Steven Pifer, a former US ambassador to Ukraine, said there was a two-way failure by Washington and Kyiv to anticipate the ambitions of a rising Russia.The annexation of Crimea and the war in Eastern Ukraine revealed Ukraine's weakness after it had given up its nuclear status. Russia's action proved that international security guarantees, especially those offered by nuclear powers, were not reliable in the presence of aggressive actions by a great power.With the growing Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the world observed how Ukraine's sovereignty was targeted head-on by a nuclear nation. Ukraine's countermove came in the form of requesting and accepting Western military aid. It was about high-end weapons and intel sharing, but it left more questions on larger Ukrainian security concerns. The Budapest Memorandum that had provided for protection earlier hadn't managed to deter the violence it was intended to prevent.The ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict illustrates the vulnerabilities of Ukrainian security in an order of the world where nuclear forces are not dependable guarantors of peace. The conflict has caused immense suffering and devastation on the human dimension, posing severe questions about Ukrainian territorial integrity and whether international assurances of security could reasonably deter future aggression.","After the fall of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, Ukraine was left with one of the world's largest nuclear stockpiles.

A return to extreme vetting?

“They vetted us, then they banned us”

Pakistan also on the list?

“Leave now” warning issued

What happens next?

A new travel ban from President Donald Trump could take effect as early as next week, potentially barring travelers from Pakistan and Afghanistan in a dramatic escalation of his immigration crackdown, as per the sources quoted by Reuters.The policy, eerily reminiscent of Trump’s controversial “Muslim ban” from his first term, is set to block thousands of Afghans who aided US forces from reaching safety, throwing their fates into uncertainty.As per reports, the new restrictions stem from an executive order Trump signed on January 20, his first day back in office. The order mandates a stricter security review of foreign nationals and demands a list of countries that allegedly pose national security risks. That list, sources say, includes Afghanistan and Pakistan, with other nations possibly being added.While the Trump administration insists the move is about security, critics call it a heartless betrayal of Afghan allies who risked their lives working alongside American forces.Among those left in limbo are over 200,000 Afghans awaiting US visas—many of them former translators, military aides, and government workers promised protection from Taliban retaliation.“Afghans who cleared resettlement screenings are already the most heavily vetted people in the world,” a US official familiar with the process was quoted as saying. “And yet, here we are, shutting the door in their faces.”Trump’s crackdown also comes amid rising Taliban violence and Islamic State insurgencies in Afghanistan, leaving many fearing that deportations or stranded visa applicants could face deadly consequences.Pakistan, a nuclear-armed nation and longtime US ally, is also expected to be included in the ban. The move is likely to inflame tensions between Washington and Islamabad, especially as Pakistan grapples with its own wave of violent extremism.With 20,000 Afghan refugees stuck in Pakistan, advocates fear a bureaucratic nightmare unfolding—stranded visa holders, families torn apart, and mounting pressure on an already overwhelmed Pakistani government.In response, Shawn VanDiver, head of the #AfghanEvac coalition, is urging visa holders to leave immediately.""Multiple sources within the US government suggest a new travel restriction could be implemented within the next week,"" he said in a statement.The official list of banned countries is expected by March 12, while Afghan resettlement efforts could be shut down by April. Trump's 90-day freeze on refugee admissions has already left thousands stranded in limbo.While legal challenges and diplomatic pushback are inevitable, for many Afghans and Pakistanis desperate to reach the US, time is running out.","A new travel ban from President Donald Trump could take effect as early as next week, potentially barring travelers from Pakistan and Afghanistan.

The internet has a new political meme star— US Vice President JD Vance . Following a tense Oval Office confrontation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on February 28, Vance has become the subject of viral memes, with social media users mocking his demeanor and remarks.During the high-stakes meeting, Vance aggressively challenged Zelenskyy’s request for more US funding, questioning his credibility and warning that American support might dwindle if Ukraine didn’t accept Washington’s terms. The exchange reportedly strained diplomatic ties, but it was one particular phrase that set the internet ablaze—Vance’s repeated demand: “Did you even say thank you?”Memes flooded X (formerly Twitter), with exaggerated edits of Vance as everything from an ogre to a spoiled child clutching a lollipop. Some gave him airbrushed features, plump lips, and perfectly groomed eyebrows. One widely shared post captioned, ""JD Vance’s inner diva is finally unleashed.""The fallout wasn’t just digital. As Vance vacationed in Vermont, he was met with a wave of protests from pro-Ukraine demonstrators carrying signs that read “International embarrassment” and “Vermont stands with Ukraine.” The backlash forced Vance and his family to relocate from their planned ski resort to an undisclosed location, reports say.Meanwhile, President Trump jumped into the controversy, accusing Zelenskyy of “gambling with World War III” for refusing to compromise on Ukraine’s position. The visit ultimately ended in failure for Zelenskyy, who left Washington without securing additional US aid or finalizing a minerals deal.The White House has yet to comment on the viral storm, but one thing is clear—JD Vance’s internet infamy isn’t fading anytime soon.","US Vice President JD Vance has become the subject of viral memes.

Why Was Barron Missing from the Joint Address?

The Rest of the

Trump Family

Barron Trump , the youngest son of US president Donald Trump, was not present at his father's recent joint address to Congress, but the reason for his absence was a practical one, according to a report.While his siblings—Ivanka, along with her husband Jared Kushner; Don Jr., with girlfriend Bettina Anderson; Eric; and Tiffany, with her husband Michael Boulos—were in attendance at the joint meeting, accompanied by their mother, Melania Trump , Barron was notably absent, as reported by the Daily Mail.Barron, the 18-year-old freshman at New York University (NYU), had classes scheduled for the week and was therefore unable to attend the event in Washington DC, according to the Daily Mail. As a resident of Trump Tower in New York, his university experience is far from that of an ordinary student due to the 24/7 Secret Service protection he receives, the report stated.In December, his mother commented on the unique challenges he faces, saying, ""I don't think it's possible for him to be a normal student. His experience at college—it's very different from any other kid,"" as quoted by the Daily Mail.Melania, who spent most of her first month as First Lady in New York with Barron, has always been particularly protective of him, the report noted. However, she has also publicly praised the ways in which Barron has contributed to his father’s political campaigns. In January, she told Fox News that Barron had advised his father on how to reach young male voters in the 2024 election, recommending podcasts that would appeal to them, according to the Daily Mail.Keeping Barron Away from Major EventsDespite acknowledging Barron’s involvement, Melania has largely kept him away from high-profile political events, including the Republican National Convention this summer, the Daily Mail reported. Barron, who was just 10 years old when his father first took office, spent his teenage years in the White House and is now navigating adulthood.Although Barron did not attend the joint address, Melania stated that he would visit them in Washington DC. She told Fox News, ""I feel that children, when they reach 18 or 19 years old, we teach them, we guide them, and then we give them the wings to fly. I always respect Barron's yes and no—what he likes to do and where he wants to be,"" as quoted by the Daily Mail.While Barron remains somewhat out of the spotlight, his siblings continue to be active in both their personal and professional lives. Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner, now living in Miami with their three children, have stepped away from politics to focus on family but remain a strong emotional support for the president, according to the report.Meanwhile, Don Jr., Eric, and Tiffany remain engaged in their own business and personal ventures. Tiffany and her husband, Michael Boulos, are expecting their first child, while Lara Trump has launched a new programme on Fox News, the Daily Mail reported.","Barron Trump, the youngest son of US president Donald Trump, was not present at his father's recent joint address to Congress.

If you are a foreign student who is a supporter of Palestinian Hamas militants and living in the United States then maybe there is a high chance that your visa will be revoked as the US is planning to revoke such visas, according to the Reuters citing Axios.The state department is planning to deploy artificial intelligence technology to cancel visas of international students that seems to be supportive of Hamas.Following Trump's January executive order against antisemitism, the administration aims to remove non-citizen university students participating in pro-Palestinian demonstrations, which have continued throughout Israel's military campaign in Gaza following Hamas' October 2023 assault.The AI-fueled ""Catch and Revoke"" effort will include AI-assisted reviews of tens of thousands of student visa holders' social media accounts, Axios reported.Officials are reviewing media coverage of anti-Israel demonstrations and examining legal complaints from Jewish students regarding alleged antisemitic behaviour by foreign nationals, according to the report.Whilst some Jewish organisations support Palestinian causes and numerous protesters oppose both antisemitism and Hamas, instances of religious prejudice have occurred at both pro-Palestinian gatherings and pro-Israeli counter-demonstrations.The initiative involves collaboration between state department, justice department and homeland security, Axios reported.Trump announced plans to withdraw funding from educational institutions permitting what he terms unlawful protests.""Agitators will be imprisoned/or permanently sent back to the country from which they came. American students will be permanently expelled or .. arrested,"" Trump stated on Tuesday.Constitutional protections for free speech and assembly exist under the First Amendment. Civil rights organisations have criticised Trump's stance towards protesters.The US government classifies Hamas as a ""foreign terrorist organisation.""According to Israeli figures, the Islamist group's October 7, 2023 attack resulted in 1,200 deaths and over 250 hostages.Gaza authorities report that Israel's subsequent military operation has caused more than 48,000 Palestinian casualties, displaced nearly the entire population, and prompted allegations of genocide and war crimes, which Israel contests.","The state department is planning to deploy artificial intelligence technology to cancel visas of international students that seems to be supportive of Hamas.

Elon Musk denies responsibility for federal job cuts in talks with GOP lawmakers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elon-musk-denies-responsibility-for-federal-job-cuts-in-talks-with-gop-lawmakers/articleshow/118772006.cms,"Trump signals caution, but backs Musk's role



Legal challenges mount as job cuts escalate



Musk’s influence rattles Washington



Some workers reinstated amid growing backlash



Democrats sound the alarm



In private discussions with Republican lawmakers this week, the billionaire tech mogul insisted that the widespread dismissals of federal employees, including veterans, were decisions made by individual agencies—not by him. His remarks come as he leads the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in its mission to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal system.Musk , a close adviser to President Donald Trump, enjoys strong Republican backing for his work at DOGE. However, as job cuts ripple through communities nationwide, GOP lawmakers are facing backlash and pressing him for answers.""Elon doesn’t fire people,"" said Rep. Richard Hudson , R-N.C., after a closed-door meeting with Musk in the Capitol’s basement. ""He doesn’t have hiring and firing authority. The president's empowered him to go uncover this information, that’s it.""The Republican president weighed in on Thursday, urging agency heads to be meticulous in their decisions. ""Be very precise"" about who stays or goes, Trump posted on social media, advocating a ""scalpel rather than the hatchet"" approach.""I don’t want to see a big cut where a lot of good people are cut,"" Trump later told reporters in the Oval Office.While Trump maintained that agency leaders would lead the process, he also suggested Musk could intervene more forcefully if necessary. ""If they can cut, it’s better. And if they don’t cut, then Elon will do the cutting.""Trump also announced that Musk and Cabinet officials would meet every two weeks to advance cost-cutting initiatives.Musk’s role in reshaping the federal workforce is facing mounting legal scrutiny. Lawsuits are piling up over his aggressive push to consolidate government management and sidestep congressional authority over federal spending.One key dispute involves the White House’s Office of Personnel Management (OPM), which instructed agencies to fire probationary workers who lack full civil service protection. The sweeping dismissals led to abrupt staff reductions, some of which were later reversed—such as the reinstatement of workers in nuclear weapons programs.A federal judge in San Francisco raised concerns about the legality of these mass terminations, prompting the administration to shift blame to individual agencies rather than Musk or the OPM.""Some of the folks that were the probationary people, he didn’t fire them, they were actually supposedly fired by the agencies — and they messed up,"" said Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla.Asked whether Musk himself used the phrase ""they messed up,"" Gimenez clarified: ""Well, if they were in fact, you know, critical people, and the agency did the firing, then yeah, they messed up. But not him.""Musk and his team have embedded themselves deep within federal agencies, gaining access to sensitive data and challenging long-standing bureaucratic structures. Their aggressive approach has unnerved career officials, with top executives—such as those at the Social Security Administration—resigning rather than complying with Musk’s demands.The billionaire appears unfazed by the upheaval. ""We're making good progress,"" he remarked as he moved swiftly through the halls of Congress late Wednesday.Musk’s reputation as a risk-taking visionary is well established through his ventures, including SpaceX, Tesla, and social media platform X. But his leadership at DOGE represents his first direct foray into government operations—where political backlash is unavoidable.During a Senate lunch discussion, Musk was quick to distance himself from the firings.""I would say that there was an argument that that’s not coming from DOGE, it’s actually coming from individual agencies,"" said Sen. Rand Paul , R-Ky.Rep. Andy Barr, R-Ky., went further, suggesting Musk believed some agencies mishandled the process deliberately. ""The point that he was making is that DOGE had not made recommendations for across-the-board cuts of all probationary employees at every agency,"" Barr said.Instead, he suggested that some agencies ""implemented it improperly through either incompetence or in a handful of cases actual malicious efforts to sabotage and create a public relations problem for DOGE.""Amid the fallout, some federal agencies are walking back job cuts. This week, about 180 employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were informed they could return to work. Their recall email carried an urgent subject line: ""Read this email immediately.""Musk was invited to Capitol Hill by Trump’s allies and GOP leaders to address lawmakers facing tough questions about the DOGE layoffs. With Republican lawmakers feeling the heat at town halls back home, House Speaker Mike Johnson , R-La., advised them to engage with constituents in less confrontational settings.To improve communication, Musk provided his personal phone number—to senators, but not to House members. His team is also setting up a dedicated phone line where lawmakers can raise concerns or offer input on which jobs and agencies should be spared.Democrats and advocacy groups are warning that the sweeping cuts could have devastating consequences for ordinary Americans.On Thursday, 141 House Democrats, led by Rep. Gerald Connolly of Virginia, wrote to the acting director of the OPM, urging the reinstatement of all unlawfully terminated probationary employees.""Indiscriminately firing thousands of these employees threatens the future of the nonpartisan federal workforce and our government’s ability to deliver life-saving services to the American people,"" the letter read.House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries issued a challenge to Republicans: if they want to dismantle federal agencies, they should bring it to Congress.""We welcome that fight,"" Jeffries said. ""We’ll stand on the side of the American people, and (Republicans will) continue to stand on the side of Elon Musk.""","Billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk is leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) DOGE's mission is to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal system.

Passengers aboard a Southwest flight from Houston to Phoenix were in for an unexpected show when a woman stripped naked mid-taxi, screamed at the top of her lungs, and tried to storm the cockpit in a bizarre preflight meltdown.Eyewitnesses described the scene as “completely unexpected.” The woman, initially fully clothed, suddenly walked to the front of the plane and demanded to be let off. When the crew continued taxiing, she lost control—jumping, screaming, and then stripping down to nothing.“She just started taking everything off—her hat, her shoes, everything,” one stunned passenger told 12 News.As the cabin descended into chaos, the nude flyer paced up and down the aisle, ignoring shocked passengers, including young children. Things escalated further when she began banging on the cockpit door, demanding entry, and rubbed her bare body against a flight attendant.With the situation spiraling, the pilot turned the plane back to the gate, where airline staff attempted to intervene.

"Is Gavin Newsom shifting right? Calls trans athletes in women’s sports 'deeply unfair,' says Democrats ‘weaponized’ issue",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/is-gavin-newsom-shifting-right-calls-trans-athletes-in-womens-sports-deeply-unfair-says-democrats-weaponized-issue/articleshow/118765940.cms,"California Gov. Gavin Newsom (AP)

A calculated move for 2028?

Cracks in the Democratic narrative?

He rejected the term “Latinx”

He called defunding the police “lunacy”

He criticized “cancel culture”

He admitted private doubts from Democratic friends about trans inclusion in sports

The takeaway: Is Newsom pivoting right?

California Governor Gavin Newsom , once a trailblazer for LGBTQ+ rights, made a surprising admission: Democrats are losing the battle on transgender athletes in women’s sports.During the first episode of his new podcast This Is Gavin Newsom, the governor told conservative activist Charlie Kirk that the issue was “deeply unfair” and that his party was taking a serious political hit.“We’re getting crushed on it. Crushed. Crushed,” Newsom said, acknowledging the growing backlash.This is a stark shift for Newsom, who famously defied his own party two decades ago by issuing same-sex marriage licenses in San Francisco. Now, he’s signaling that Democrats may have miscalculated on trans athletes, particularly in youth and college sports.Newsom’s strategic shift comes as he positions himself for a potential 2028 presidential run . He was surprisingly open with Kirk, even praising a Trump campaign attack ad that used Vice President Kamala Harris' past support for taxpayer-funded gender transition surgeries for detained immigrants against her.“She didn’t even react to it, which was even more devastating,” Newsom noted, calling the ad “brutal” and “great”—a statement few Democrats would dare to make.While Newsom reaffirmed his commitment to LGBTQ+ rights, he also distanced himself from progressive talking points:His biggest break came when he discussed AB Hernandez, a transgender high school track star whose victory in California has fueled conservative outrage. When pressed by Kirk, Newsom didn’t defend the policy but instead admitted:“The issue of fairness is completely legit.”Newsom’s tone shift on trans issues, crime, and progressive culture wars suggests a calculated repositioning—one that could set him apart in a future Democratic primary. While he stopped short of calling for bans, his willingness to agree with MAGA-world influencers shows a more pragmatic, centrist-friendly approach.Could this be the beginning of a Democratic shift on trans athletes? Newsom’s words suggest he’s reading the political winds—and they’re not blowing left.","California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Democrats are losing the battle on transgender athletes in women’s sports.

ISLAMABAD: Anguished cries of mourners preparing to bury their dead pierced an uneasy calm in Bannu cantonment of Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Wednesday, a day after 13 civilians and five soldiers were killed in a burst of mayhem caused by militants ramming two explosives-laden vehicles into a wall of the army compound.Seven of the civilian casualties in the violence late Tuesday were children while five were women. Jaish al-Fursan, a militant group linked to Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, claimed responsibility for the attack and declared that dozens of soldiers were killed.The army said its prompt response to the militant incursion into the cantonment city helped thwart what could have been a suicide attack with far more devastating consequences. All 16 militants involved in the raid were killed, taking the casualties to 34, the military's media wing said.Schools and shops in Bannu city didn't open the morning after and remained shut throughout the day, reflecting that gloom that descended in the area, adjacent to the restive North Waziristan tribal district bordering Afghanistan. This was the second militant attack on the cantonment within a year and the third within Pakistan since the start of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan last Sunday.In a statement shared on social media, Jaish al-Fursan said the blasts were triggered through explosives-laden vehicles.Official sources said the militant raiders blew up the vehicles at the gate after they were intercepted by security personnel stationed at the entrance. The attack started at 6.30pm, minutes after iftar (break in fasting), and was followed by an unspecified number of militants trying to infiltrate the camp. This resulted in a gunfight that continued till the last of the militants were killed.Over a dozen people were buried in the debris of walls and roofs of multiple houses destroyed by the explosions. A mosque next to the cantonment's entrance also collapsed, trapping a number of worshippers in the rubble. They were pulled out of the debris after the fighting ended.A few days earlier, a suicide bomber killed six people at an Islamic religious school in Akora Khattak town of the same province. Several Taliban leaders graduated from this school, infamous as the ""university of jihad"".Last year was the deadliest in a decade for Pakistan, with a surge in attacks in which over 1,600 lives were lost, according to official data.Islamabad accuses Kabul of failing to root out fighters sheltering on its soil and preparing to mount assaults on Pakistan, a charge the Taliban govt stoutly denies.Jaish al-Fursan is headed by Hafiz Gul Bahadur, a commander of what used to be regarded as the ""good Taliban"".","Jaish al-Fursan, a militant group linked to Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, claimed responsibility for the attack.

ISLAMABAD: US President Donald Trump's announcement to Congress late Tuesday about the capture of most-wanted terrorist Mohammad Sharifulla – mastermind of the 2021 Abbey Gate bombing outside Kabul airport that killed 13 American military service personnel and 170-odd Afghans – came with a surprise pat on Pakistan's back for its role in the operation.""Tonight, I am pleased to announce that we have just apprehended the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity, and he is on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice,"" Trump said in his first address to Congress since returning to the White House for a second term.""I want to thank especially the govt of Pakistan for helping arrest this monster,"" he said of the prolonged search culminating in forces tracing Sharifulla to a hideout on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.According to US media reports, CIA and Pakistani intelligence worked closely to find Sharifulla, whom Pakistan described as a ""top-tier operational commander"" of the proscribed Islamic State-Khorasan Province (IS-KP). The terrorist outfit had claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing that followed the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan that year.Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif was quick to highlight what his govt sees as an opportunity to regain the US's faith as a strategic partner following years of friction, notably after America's exit from Afghanistan and Washington’s growing closeness with India.Within the country, it gives the Sharif govt an advantage over former PM Imran Khan's Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), whose Pakistani-American supporters in the US had campaigned for Trump in the 2024 presidential election. They would possibly be disappointed by Trump's speech to Congress, which included no reference to Imran, PTI or Pakistan's democratic process.Sharif separately announced Sharifullah's arrest through a post on X. ""We thank US President Donald Trump for acknowledging and appreciating Pakistan's role and support in counter terrorism efforts across the region,"" he wrote.""As is well-known, Pakistan has always played a critical role in counter terrorism efforts aimed at denying safe havens to terrorists and militant groups the space to operate against any other country.""In neighbouring India, the reference to ""any other country"" could well spark a debate for a different reason.",US President Donald Trump announced the capture of most-wanted terrorist Mohammad Sharifulla.

The big picture



Renewed counterterrorism cooperation: A Pakistani security official told Reuters that Pakistan’s assistance in the arrest stemmed from “excellent cooperation” between Islamabad and Trump’s new administration. This marks a shift from recent years, where US-Pakistan security collaboration had diminished following the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan.

A Pakistani security official told Reuters that Pakistan’s assistance in the arrest stemmed from “excellent cooperation” between Islamabad and Trump’s new administration. This marks a shift from recent years, where US-Pakistan security collaboration had diminished following the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan. Regional security concerns: The Islamic State Khorasan, IS’s regional affiliate, has been linked to several high-profile international attacks, including the March 2024 Moscow concert hall bombing that killed over 140 people and the deadly attack in Iran last year. The Kabul airport bombing was one of its most infamous acts, underscoring the group's capability to carry out large-scale terror operations.

The Kabul airport bombing was one of its most infamous acts, underscoring the group's capability to carry out large-scale terror operations. Pakistan’s domestic threats: IS-K has expanded its reach beyond Afghanistan, increasingly targeting Pakistani cities and security forces. Meanwhile, the TTP has launched numerous deadly attacks in Pakistan’s tribal regions. The government has struggled to contain these threats, making counterterrorism cooperation with the US a strategic necessity.

Between the lines



What’s next



US-Pakistan relations: If this counterterrorism cooperation continues, it could lead to a thaw in relations between the two countries, potentially reviving security assistance programs that had been cut in recent years. The US may also push Pakistan to do more against militant safe havens within its borders.

The US may also push Pakistan to do more against militant safe havens within its borders. Impact on Pakistan’s security landscape: The arrest of Sharifullah may disrupt IS-K’s operational capabilities in the short term, but the group remains a potent threat. Pakistan will need to step up intelligence-sharing and military operations to prevent retaliatory attacks from IS-K and TTP.

The arrest of Sharifullah may disrupt IS-K’s operational capabilities in the short term, but the group remains a potent threat. Pakistan will need to step up intelligence-sharing and military operations to prevent retaliatory attacks from IS-K and TTP. Broader implications for Afghanistan: This arrest further highlights Afghanistan’s growing role as a sanctuary for international terrorist networks. The Taliban’s ability (or unwillingness) to suppress IS-K will be a key issue for regional stability.

Pakistani security forces played a crucial role in capturing Mohammad Sharifullah , a top commander of the Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K), who was allegedly responsible for the devastating suicide bombing outside Kabul airport in August 2021. The attack, which occurred during the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan, killed 13 US service members and 170 Afghan civilians.President Donald Trump, in his first address to Congress since his return to the White House, announced that Pakistan had helped arrest “the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity.” While he did not provide details about the operation, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif later confirmed that Sharifullah was apprehended in a counterterrorism raid along the Pakistan-Afghan border.Pakistan’s involvement in this high-profile counterterrorism operation could significantly reshape its relationship with the US.By assisting in Sharifullah’s arrest, Pakistan is signaling its willingness to re-engage with Washington on security matters.This move comes as Pakistan faces increasing pressure from militant groups, including IS-K and the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which have intensified attacks within the country.The operation could help Islamabad gain favor with the US, potentially unlocking military and economic assistance at a time when Pakistan is grappling with financial instability.Pakistan’s decision to assist in Sharifullah’s arrest is not just about counterterrorism—it is also about geopolitics. The country’s strategic importance has waned since the US and Nato withdrawal from Afghanistan, but this operation could help Islamabad regain relevance in Washington’s security calculus.South Asia expert Michael Kugelman noted that Pakistan is trying to “leverage US concerns about terror in Afghanistan and pitch a renewed security partnership.”At the same time, Pakistan’s cooperation might be seen as a balancing act. Islamabad has maintained complex ties with the Afghan Taliban, and it remains to be seen how Kabul will react to this development.The US justice department has charged Sharifullah with ""providing and conspiring to provide material support and resources"" to the group.""He confessed. This was the planner of that bombing,"" White House national security adviser Mike Waltz said in an interview with Fox News.FBI director Kash Patel said Sharifullah was in US custody, in a post on X alongside a picture of agents standing in front of the plane that he was due to arrive on.""That time you delivered the sword of justice for the American people- thank you for your incredible leadership @AGPamBondi and @JohnRatcliffe.

ISLAMABAD: At least five people were killed and 20 injured in a suicide blast at a mosque of an Islamic religious school known as the “university of jihad” in Nowshera district of Pakistan’s northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province on Friday.Among the dead were Maulana Hamid-ul-Haq Haqqani , head of Dar-ul-Uloom Haqqania school, the seminary in Nowshera’s Akora Khattak town where key Afghan Taliban leaders have studied. Mullah Omer, the slain founder of the Taliban movement in Afghanistan, was also an alumni of this religious school.Graduates of the seminary include current Afghan Taliban leaders Amir Khan Muttaqi, Sirajuddin Haqqani, Abdul Latif Mansoor, Maulvi Ahmad Jan, Mullah Jalaludin Haqani, Maulvi Qalamudin, Arifullah Arif and Mullah Khairullah Khairkhwa.The explosion occurred in the main prayer hall as people gathered for weekly Friday prayers were leaving the mosque.KP police chief Zulfiqar Hameed confirmed that it was a suicide attack and that three policemen were also injured. “More than a dozen police officers were guarding the mosque when the attack occurred, and Haq’s seminary also had its own security,” he said.“It appears that Hamid Haqqani (seminary’s slain chief) was the target,” Hameed added.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the attack, which came on the last Friday ahead of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.Yawar Zia, a police constable, who was injured in the attack, said he was on security duty at the seminary when the blast happened and splinters hit him. “After offering prayer, Hamid-ul-Haq, accompanied by his guards, was leaving the mosque when the powerful explosion occurred,” the wounded official said.Eyewitnesses described a chaotic scene, with blood and body parts scattered all over the place. They said the casualties could have been much higher had the bomber struck during the prayers.Haqqani, the son of slain prominent Pakistani cleric Sami-ul-Haq Haqqani, known as the “father of Taliban, was a vice-chancellor of the sprawling seminary, located 60 km from the provincial capital of Peshawar. Following his father’s assassination in 2018, he also became chairman of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Sami (JUI-S) political party. He had also previously served as a member of the National Assembly from 2002 to 2007.Haq was also among the few who called on the world and Pakistan to immediately recognise the Taliban govt and establish diplomatic relations with Afghanistan after the fall of Kabul in 2021.Last year, he led a delegation of religious scholars to Afghanistan for “religious diplomacy” meetings with Taliban leaders.His seminary had faced controversy in the past as its students were accused of involvement in the assassination of Pakistan’s former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto. The madrasa, however, denied any connection with the suspects.","At least five people were killed and 20 injured in a suicide blast at a mosque.

China has signed an agreement with Pakistan to send a Pakistani astronaut to its space station, Tiangong , marking the first time a foreign national will be aboard the facility.The deal was signed in a ceremony held in Islamabad on Friday, between the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) and Pakistan’s Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO). Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was alos present during the ceremony.According to a statement by CMSA, both nations will collaborate on selecting and training Pakistani astronauts, with the chosen candidate expected to join Chinese taikonauts for a short-term mission in the coming years.""This signifies a major step in China’s international space cooperation ,"" reported Global Times, highlighting the growing partnership between Beijing and Islamabad in aerospace advancements.China’s space station, which has been operational for nearly four years, was built after the country was reportedly excluded from the International Space Station (ISS) due to concerns over the involvement of China’s military in its space programme.The station is also seen as a new frontier of competition between China and the US.As per the news agency PTI, the agreement further solidifies China’s support for Pakistan’s space ambitions, following previous collaborations such as the launch of Pakistani satellites.Pakistan’s first digital communications satellite, Badr-1, was launched aboard a Chinese Long March 2E rocket in 1990, while earlier this year, Pakistan’s CubeSat accompanied China’s Chang’e-6 probe to the Moon.According to Global Times, the selection of the astronaut is expected to take around a year, after which the candidate will undergo intensive training in China. This move, experts say, demonstrates the reliability of China's manned space technology and its willingness to lower barriers for developing countries to participate in space exploration .China has also set ambitious goals for space exploration, with plans to land astronauts on the Moon before 2030.Meanwhile, the US has its sights set on returning to the lunar surface by 2025.","China has signed an agreement with Pakistan to send a Pakistani astronaut to its space station, Tiangong.
