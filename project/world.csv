VARANASI: Two close aides of gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari , who died in March this year, were on Monday awarded five-year imprisonment in a case related to harassment and assault of a sanitary staff during their stay in jail in 2009.

They were sent to UP’s Ghazipur district jail . Angad Rai and Gora Rai have been convicted under IPC sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (breach of peace), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 3(1)X of SC/ST Act by the court of special judge (SC/ST Act) Shakti Singh.

They will also have to pay a fine of Rs 10,000 each, said special prosecution officer Pradeep Chaturvedi. The case was lodged by Ghazipur district jail prisoner Jitendra Ram on April 22, 2009. In the FIR, Ram alleged that Angad and Gora, lodged in barrack number 10, had brutally beaten him up as he had failed to clean their barrack because of illness.

"Nawaz reaches out for peace, PM Modi says security remains India’s priority",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nawaz-reaches-out-for-peace-pm-modi-says-security-remains-indias-priority/articleshow/110883268.cms,"NEW DELHI: Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif congratulated his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi for taking over as prime minister for the third time but more significant was a felicitation message from the elder Sharif - former PM Nawaz Sharif - who spoke about replacing hate with hope and seizing this “opportunity to shape the destiny of the two billion people of South Asia”. Modi expressed appreciation for the message, saying the people of India have always stood for peace, security and progressive ideas.“Advancing the well-being and security of our people shall always remain our priority,” said Modi, who did not invite Pakistan for the inauguration of his third term. Modi’s emphasis on security is in line with his government’s long held position that Pakistan’s continued support to cross-border terrorism is not conducive for dialogue.Nawaz had just before the election outcome too reached out to India’s incoming government by reiterating his position that it was Pakistan which had violated his 1999 peace agreement with India in the form of the Lahore Declaration through its Kargil offensive. However, his remarks now constitute the first direct peace outreach to India since the coalition government in Pakistan took power earlier this year.Nawaz said Modi’s success in elections reflects the confidence of the people in his leadership. “Let us replace hate with hope and seize the opportunity to shape the destiny of the two billion people of South Asia,” said Nawaz, who was recently re-elected president of his party, in a post on X.Coming from the most powerful civilian leader in Pakistan, and one who is known to share a close rapport with Modi himself, the remarks are particularly significant. Modi thanked Shehbaz for his message.It was under Modi and Nawaz - in 2015 when then foreign minister Sushma Swaraj visited Islamabad - that the 2 sides had their last substantive bilateral engagement. That dialogue saw India and Pakistan relaunching the dialogue process under the new name of comprehensive bilateral dialogue. This was followed by Modi’s famous drop by, and only visit to Pakistan as PM, in Lahore on Nawaz’s birthday but that initiative also quickly fizzled out because of the Pathankot terror attack and later the Uri attack.India has refused to have any diplomatic engagement ever since, except for the Indus Waters Treaty talks, and Pakistan itself decided to downgrade ties by recalling its high commissioner in 2019 after India revoked the special status of the erstwhile state of J&K.The 2 countries will have an opportunity to attempt a reset in ties next month when both PMs travel to Kazakhstan for the SCO summit. However, it’s unlikely India will propose any meeting, given the understanding in the government that Pakistan is yet to act decisively against cross-border terrorism. Official sources also maintain Pakistan has to review its decision to downgrade ties before nursing any thought of forward movement in the relationship.Nawaz’s call for working together also doesn’t sit well with Pakistan’s official position that India must reverse its “unilateral and illegal” measures in J&K for talks to take place. With the Supreme Court upholding the revocation of the special status, the Indian government believes Pakistan cannot have any say in how the internal affairs of J&K are run.","Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif congratulated his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi for taking over as prime minister for the third time.

SYDNEY: New Zealand said on Tuesday it would send 41 more military personnel to the United Nations mission along the heavily fortified Demilitarised Zone between North and South Korea , as it looks to step up its role in international missions.

Defence minister Judith Collins said the decision to increase New Zealand's military presence from 12 to as many as 53 at the UN Command Security Battalion reflected its commitment to support peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.

The mandate for the longstanding deployment to South Korea has been extended until September 2026, Collins said.

Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has been working to increase New Zealand's international engagement since taking office last year, including sending a maritime security team to the Red Sea.

Jurors in Hunter Biden’s gun trial begin deliberating whether he’s guilty of federal firearm charges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jurors-in-hunter-bidens-gun-trial-begin-deliberating-whether-hes-guilty-of-federal-firearm-charges/articleshow/110887170.cms,"WILMINGTON: Jurors in Hunter Biden ’s gun trial began deliberating Monday whether the president’s son is guilty of federal firearms charges over a revolver he bought in 2018 when prosecutors say he was addicted to crack cocaine.He's charged with three felonies in the case that has laid bare some of the darkest moments of his drug-fueled past. Prosecutors have used testimony from former romantic partners, personal text messages and photos of Hunter Biden with drug paraphernalia or partially clothed to make the case that he broke the law.“No one is above the law,” prosecutor Leo Wise told jurors in his closing argument as first lady Jill Biden watched from the front row of the Wilmington, Delaware, courtroom.Jurors deliberated for less than an hour before leaving the courthouse for the day. Deliberations were to resume Tuesday morning.President Joe Biden's son has publicly detailed his struggle with a crack cocaine addiction before getting sober more than five years ago. But the defense sought to show that that he did not consider himself an “addict” when he bought the gun and checked “no” on the form that asked whether he was “an unlawful user"" of drugs or addicted to them.The case has pitted Hunter Biden against his father's Justice Department in the midst of the Democratic president's reelection campaign. The charges were brought by special counsel David Weiss, who was nominated by Republican former President Donald Trump to be U.S. attorney for Delaware and led the yearslong investigation.Before the case went to the jury, the prosecutor urged jurors to focus on the “overwhelming” evidence against Hunter Biden and pay no mind to members of the president's family sitting in the courtroom.“All of this is not evidence,” Wise said, extending his hand and directing the jury to look at the gallery. “People sitting in the gallery are not evidence.”Jill Biden and other family members left the courthouse shortly after deliberations began. The first lady sat through most of the trial, missing only one day last week to attend D-Day anniversary events with the president in France. At one point Monday, Hunter Biden leaned over a railing to whisper in his mother’s ear.Defense attorney Abbe Lowell told jurors in his closing argument that prosecutors had failed to prove their case. Lowell said the his client may have a famous last name, but he is still presumed innocent until proven guilty like any other defendant.“With my last breath in this case, I ask for the only verdict that will hold the prosecutors to what the law requires of them"" — a verdict of not guilty, Lowell said.Hunter Biden's lawyers have suggested he was trying to turn his life around at the time of the gun purchase, having completed a detoxification and rehabilitation program at the end of August 2018. The defense called three witnesses, including Hunter's daughter Naomi, who told jurors that her father seemed be improving in the weeks before he bought the gun.Closing arguments came shortly after the defense rested its case without calling Hunter Biden to the witness stand. Biden didn't elaborate on his decision when he told U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika that he was waiving his right to testify , according to a transcript of the sidebar discussion at the bench.Hunter Biden smiled as he chatted with members of his defense team and flashed a thumbs-up sign to a supporter in the gallery after the final witness — an FBI agent called by prosecutors in their rebuttal case.The trial has put a spotlight on a turbulent time in Hunter Biden's life after the 2015 death of his brother, Beau, from brain cancer. The proceedings have played out in the president’s home state, where Hunter Biden grew up and where the family is deeply established. Joe Biden spent 36 years as a senator in Delaware, commuting daily to Washington, and Beau Biden was the state's attorney general.Hunter Biden's ex-wife and two former girlfriends testified for prosecutors about his habitual crack use and their failed efforts to help him get clean. One woman, who met Hunter Biden in 2017 at a strip club where she worked, described him smoking crack every 20 minutes or so while she stayed with him at a hotel.Jurors have also heard him describe at length his descent into addiction through audio excerpts played in court of his 2021 memoir, “Beautiful Things."" The book, written after he got sober, covers the period he had the gun but doesn’t mention it specifically.A key witness for prosecutors was Beau’s widow, Hallie, who had a brief, troubled relationship with Hunter after his brother's death. She found the unloaded gun in Hunter’s truck on Oct. 23, 2018, panicked and tossed it into a garbage can at a grocery store in Wilmington, where a man seeking recyclables inadvertently fished it out of the trash.The prosecutor pointed to text messages he said show Hunter trying to make drug deals in the days around the gun purchase. In one message, Hunter told Hallie he was smoking crack. “That’s my truth,” Hunter wrote.“Take the defendant’s word for it. That’s his truth,” Wise said. He urged jurors to reject the defense's suggestion that Hunter did not really mean what he was texting at the time and was simply trying to avoid being with Hallie.“You don’t leave your common sense behind when you come into that jury box,” Wise said.The defense told jurors that there was no actual witness to drug use by Hunter during the 11 days that he had the gun. Lowell also sought to discredit testimony from Hallie and another ex-girlfriend. He told jurors to consider their testimony “with great care and caution,” noting that they were given immunity agreements in exchange for taking the witness stand for prosecutors.Joe Biden said last week that he would accept the jury’s verdict and ruled out a presidential pardon for his son. After flying back from France, the president was at his home in Wilmington for the day and was expected in Washington in the evening for a Juneteenth concert. He was scheduled to travel to Italy later this week for the Group of Seven leaders conference.Last summer, it looked as if Hunter Biden would avoid prosecution in the gun case altogether, but a deal with prosecutors imploded after the judge, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, raised concerns about it. Hunter Biden also faces a trial scheduled for September on felony charges alleging he failed to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes over four years.If convicted in the gun case, he faces up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it’s unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.","Hunter Biden is charged with three felonies in the case that has laid bare some of the darkest moments of his drug-fueled past.

That is why we are leaving the emergency government today, with a heavy heart but with full confidence,"" Gantz announced during a televised press conference.Gantz's resignation was anticipated since he had given the conservative prime minister a deadline of June 8 to present a clear post-conflict strategy for Gaza, where Israel has been conducting a devastating military campaign against Hamas, the governing Palestinian militant organisation.The loss of Gantz means that Netanyahu will no longer have the support of a centrist bloc that has helped to increase support for the government both within Israel and internationally, at a time when diplomatic and internal pressure is mounting eight months into the Gaza conflict.Initially, Gantz was set to announce his resignation on Saturday, but he delayed the announcement following the dramatic rescue of four Israeli hostages by Israeli forces.Israel's retaliatory military offensive targeting Hamas in Gaza has killed at least 37,084 people, also mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.Gantz triggered the ire of Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party in March when he made an official visit to Washington.He continued his political manoeuvring in the following weeks, calling for early legislative elections and issuing an ultimatum to Netanyahu: agree to a plan for post-war Gaza by June 8, or Gantz would quit the government.Last month, his party said it had submitted a bill to dissolve parliament and hold an early election -- in which it would have little chance of success against Netanyahu's coalition.(With inputs from agencies)",Israeli minister Benny Gantz on Sunday announced his resignation from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's emergency government.

Baltimore shipping channel fully reopens after bridge collapse,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/baltimore-shipping-channel-fully-reopens-after-bridge-collapse/articleshow/110888632.cms,"BALTIMORE: The main shipping channel into Baltimore’s port has fully reopened to its original depth and width following the March 26 collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge , which blocked most maritime traffic into the harbor.Officials announced the full reopening in a news release Monday evening. It comes after a massive cleanup effort as crews removed an estimated 50,000 tons of steel and concrete from the Patapsco River.The channel was blocked by wreckage of the fallen bridge, which collapsed after a container ship lost power and crashed into one of its supporting columns, sending six members of a roadwork crew plunging to their deaths. All of the victims were Latino immigrants working an overnight shift to fill potholes on the bridge.The Port of Baltimore , which processes more cars and farm equipment than any other in the country, was effectively closed for several weeks while the wreckage was removed. Crews were able to reopen portions of the deep-draft channel in phases, restoring some commercial traffic in recent weeks.On May 20, the wayward cargo ship Dali was refloated and guided back to port. The vessel had been stuck amid the wreckage for almost two months, with a massive steel truss draped across its damaged bow.After the Dali was moved, crews opened a channel that was 50 feet (15 meters) deep and 400 feet (122 meters) wide. The full federal shipping channel is 700 feet (213 meters) wide, which means two-way traffic can resume, officials said. They said other additional safety requirements have also been lifted because of the increased width.Thousands of longshoremen, truckers and small business owners have seen their jobs impacted by the collapse, prompting local and state officials to prioritize reopening the port and restoring its traffic to normal capacity in hopes of easing the economic ripple effects .The announcement Monday means the commerce that depends on the busy port can begin ramping back up.Officials said a total of 56 federal, state and local agencies participated in the salvage operations, including about 500 specialists from around the world who operated a fleet of 18 barges, 22 tugboats, 13 floating cranes, 10 excavators and four survey boats.“I cannot overstate how proud I am of our team,” said Col. Estee Pinchasin, Baltimore district commander for the Army Corps of Engineers. “It was incredible seeing so many people from different parts of our government, from around our country and all over the world, come together in the Unified Command and accomplish so much in this amount of time.”In a statement Monday, Pinchasin also acknowledged the loss of the victims’ families.“Not a day went by that we didn’t think about all of them, and that kept us going,” she said.The Dali lost power shortly after leaving Baltimore for Sri Lanka in the early hours of March 26. A National Transportation Safety Board investigation found it experienced power outages before starting its voyage, but the exact causes of the electrical issues have yet to be determined. The FBI is also conducting a criminal investigation into the circumstances leading up to the collapse.Officials have said they hope to rebuild the bridge by 2028.","The main shipping channel into Baltimore’s port has fully reopened to its original depth and width. It comes after a massive cleanup effort as crews removed an estimated 50,000 tons of steel and concrete from the Patapsco River. The channel was blocked by wreckage of the fallen bridge, which collapsed after a container ship lost power.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110888633,imgsize-262810,width-400,resizemode-4/110888633.jpg"
Report: US mulls unilateral talks with Hamas to free Americans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/report-us-mulls-unilateral-talks-with-hamas-to-free-americans/articleshow/110885570.cms,"WASHINGTON: US officials have considered negotiating a unilateral deal with Hamas militants to release five American hostages held in Gaza if ceasefire talks involving Israel fail, NBC News reported Monday. It was not clear what the US might offer Hamas in exchange, according to the report, which cited two current and two former US officials.

The US says Hamas is holding five Americans who were taken hostage in the group's Oct. 7 incursion inside Israel, which prompted Israel to retaliate. Officials are hoping to recover the bodies of three other Americans who were killed that day, NBC reported.

US secretary of state Antony Blinken, asked about the report as he left Cairo, said, ""The best way, the most effective way to get everyone home, including the American hostages, is through this proposal, is through the ceasefire deal that's on the table right now.""

Any unilateral talks would be conducted through Qatari negotiators and would not involve Israel, the unidentified officials, who have all been briefed on the negotiations, told NBC. They said Hamas would have an incentive to reach such a deal with Washington as it would strain US-Israel ties further and add pressure on Israeli PM Netanyahu, who has been criticised for not doing more to get hostages out.

The class president welcomed the crowd. Then the principal, looking out at the clouds, declared all the students graduates and told those in attendance to find shelter immediately. ""The sky turned pea green, horrible clouds rolled in, and sirens started going off,"" said Nuala Murray South, one of the graduates. Sterling Crim, another graduate, grabbed the hand of his girlfriend and dragged her under the bleachers next to the brick wall of a concession stand. The tornado never materialised. But the day - and the rite - were ruined.

They unceremoniously picked up their diplomas from the high school later. But long after going off to college, starting careers and families, many harboured a hope that they would eventually cross the stage.

South, Crim and about 200 of their fellow classmates or relatives of those who died got a commencement redo Saturday.

The desire for a commencement ceremony had become a running theme at alumni reunions for the Moore High School class of 1974. The former classmates debated the idea on social media. Finally, last year, a former student, Mike Wilson, who works as a sports announcer at the school, broached the school administration with the idea of a commencement timed with the class's 50th reunion . ""The older you get, you just look back and think you've missed out on something,"" Wilson said, adding that the administration was quick to offer a full ceremony in the high school auditorium, complete with a processional to the music of Edward Elgar's ""Pomp and Circumstance"" march and crossing the stage for their diplomas.

","The event was to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the opening day of the University of Texas at Austin's football stadium. It was also to mark the start of the university's 100th year of existence.

And this comes from none other than Pranay Vaddi, special assistant to Joe Biden, the US president.Vaddi, of Andhra origin, is senior director for arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation at the National Security Council of the US.As recent as June 7, he told a meeting of the US Arms Control Association in Washington that keeping in view of the upgrades by Russia, China, and North Korea to their nuclear capabilities, “... we (US) are modernizing each leg of our nuclear triad , updating our nuclear command, control, and communication systems, and investing in our nuclear enterprise — to ensure that we can sustain and, if necessary, enhance our capabilities and posture.”He said that as part of the nuclear modernization programme, the US is pursuing the B61-13 gravity bomb to provide additional capability against certain harder and large-area military targets.The B61-13 is a thermonuclear gravity bomb designed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.Pointing that the B61-13 is an example of a qualitative improvement to the US nuclear arsenal, Vaddi said that “ ... it will enhance deterrence without increasing overall numbers.”According to him, this will allow the US to move beyond the outdated megaton-class B83-1 which is being retired.In addition, the life of certain Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines is being extended to provide additional margin during transition from legacy to modern capabilities across the triad, he stated.“Russia, the PRC (People’s Republic Of China), and North Korea are all expanding and diversifying their nuclear arsenals at a breakneck pace, showing little or no interest in arms control,” he said.“Those three, together with Iran, are increasingly cooperating and coordinating with each other — in ways that run counter to peace and stability, threaten the United States, our allies and our partners, and exacerbate regional tension,” he said.On account of this scenario “... we will have no choice but to adjust our posture and capabilities to preserve deterrence and stability.”“We may reach a point in the coming years where an increase from current deployed numbers is required and we need to be fully prepared to execute if the President makes that decision,” he stated, adding, “If that day does come, it will result from a determination that more nuclear weapons are required to deter our adversaries and protect the American people and our allies and partners.”Vaddi said the reality is that further enhancing US capabilities and posture is incredibly important to rejuvenating strategic arms control .","Vaddi, of Andhra origin, is senior director for arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation at the National Security Council of the US.

Trump did not say when the meeting would take place.In the first-ever criminal trial of a former US president, a Manhattan jury last month found Trump guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up his former lawyer Michael Cohen's $130,000 payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels for her silence before the 2016 election about a sexual encounter she says they had a decade earlier.Trump denies the encounter and has vowed to appeal the verdict after his July 11 sentencing hearing before Justice Juan Merchan. Trump has called the charges, brought by Democratic Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a partisan attempt to interfere with his campaign.A probation officer's report is intended to give the sentencing judge a holistic view of a defendant's life circumstances and background to help decide whether a jail sentence or an alternative like probation is appropriate, said Duncan Levin, a New York defense lawyer and former Manhattan prosecutor.In a typical interview, the officer will ask defendants about their family, their childhood circumstances, their immigration status, and any drug use to compile a report to give judges context that may not have come out earlier in the case.Such details are less relevant in this case because Trump's biographical details are already widely known, Levin said.""The judge is already highly educated as to who this particular defendant is,"" Levin said.The probation officer's recommendation is just one factor that judges consider in determining a sentence for criminal defendants. Prosecutors and defense lawyers also suggest sentences.Merchan on Friday signed an order allowing Trump's defense lawyer Todd Blanche to be present during the interview. That is common, Levin said.For defendants convicted of felony falsifying business records in the past, punishments like probation or fines are most common - but jail sentences are not unprecedented.One factor that Merchan may consider is Trump's decision to take his case to trial. While any criminal defendant has the right to do so, judges often look favorably on people who admit culpability and express remorse.Trump also faces three other criminal cases stemming from efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss to Democratic President Joe Biden and his handling of sensitive government documents after leaving the White House in 2021. He has pleaded not guilty in those cases, none of which are likely to reach trial before the Nov. 5 election.",Donald Trump will be interviewed by a probation officer ahead of his sentencing next month.

"Florida on high alert after 3 shark attacks in one day, including woman who lost arm",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/florida-on-high-alert-after-3-shark-attacks-in-one-day-including-woman-who-lost-arm/articleshow/110881087.cms,"People walk along the shoreline in Navarre Beach (Pic credit: AP)

NEW DELHI: In a shocking turn of events, three shark attacks occurred within a single day on the same stretch of coastline in Florida's panhandle, leaving one woman severely injured and two teenage girls wounded. The 45-year-old woman suffered critical injuries, resulting in the amputation of part of her left arm, while the teens, aged 15 and 17, were also hurt, with one sustaining significant injuries to her upper leg and hand.

The Walton County sheriff's office has temporarily closed the beaches and is actively patrolling the waters following the incidents. They have since reopened but urge swimmers to remain cautious and aware of their surroundings at all times. The department said in a Facebook post, ""Deputies spotted a 14-foot hammerhead east of South County Highway 395 in Santa Rosa Beach this morning from the boat — which is NOT uncommon. We want to reiterate that sharks are always present in the Gulf. Swimmers and beachgoers should be cautious when swimming and be aware of their surroundings at all times.""

Authorities have posted red and purple flags on the beach to warn swimmers of the high hazard and dangerous marine life. In another Facebook post, the sheriff's office reminded visitors, ""remember, we are guests in the Gulf [of Mexico].""

Two doctors, Ryan Forbess and Mohammad Ali, who were vacationing together, happened to be in the water during the attacks and provided potentially life-saving care to the wounded girl. They worked alongside other EMTs and trauma nurses who were in the area to help the injured victim. Forbess remarked, ""It was amazing. Kind of just … it was God's will that everyone was there to help at the same time.""

Walton County Sheriff Michael A Adkinson, Jr emphasized the rarity of such incidents, saying, ""This is an anomaly … everything from it being three victims, to where it's at. All we can do is respond, control, and mitigate what we can."" The last shark attack in the county was reported in 2021, with the last fatal attack occurring in 2005.

In response, Israel launched an assault on the Gaza Strip that has killed more than 37,000 Palestinians, the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory said in its Sunday update, and reduced the enclave to a wasteland.Israeli forces rescued four hostages held by Hamas since October in a raid in Gaza on Saturday, during which 274 Palestinians were killed, according to Gaza's health ministry.Blinken's trip comes after Israeli minister Benny Gantz announced his resignation from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's emergency government on Sunday, withdrawing the only centrist power in the embattled leader's otherwise far-right coalition during the war in Gaza.Blinken is expected to meet with Gantz on Tuesday, a senior State Department official said.The departure of Gantz's centrist party will not pose an immediate threat to the government. But it could have a serious impact nonetheless, leaving Netanyahu reliant on hardliners, with no end in sight to the war and a possible escalation in fighting with Lebanese Hezbollah.Blinken has previously met with Gantz in visits to Israel.The conflict between Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah is dangerously poised after more than eight months of fighting triggered by the Gaza war, with hostilities escalating and both sides signaling a readiness for a bigger confrontation.Blinken during this week's trip will discuss with partners the need to reach a ceasefire agreement that secures the release of all hostages, as well as the need to prevent the conflict from escalating further, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a statement on Friday.He will emphasize the importance of Hamas accepting the proposal on the table, Miller added.Ceasefire talks have intensified since Biden's speech and CIA director William Burns met senior officials from mediators Qatar and Egypt on Wednesday in Doha to discuss the plan.Biden has repeatedly declared that ceasefires were close over the past several months, but there has been only one, week-long truce, in November.",US Secretary of State Antony Blinken landed in Egypt on Monday at a critical time.

Biden in recent weeks suspended a shipment of weapons to Israel and accused Netanyahu of prolonging the war to stay in power, an assertion on which he backtracked.Gantz defied Netanyahu by visiting Washington on his own in March and has regularly met in Israel with Blinken, although a meeting on the latest trip was not immediately announced.- Border crossing dilemma -The short-term effect of Gantz leaving the war cabinet could be removing a counter-balance to Netanyahu's far-right allies, who abhor any compromise and have threatened to quit if Israel accepts the ceasefire plan.Israel also showed Saturday it has more tools than diplomacy to free hostages -- its key priority -- with an operation that freed four Israeli captives and which Palestinian officials say killed 274 other people.Overall Israel's retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 37,084 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the territory's health ministry.Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, also mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.Under the plan laid out by Biden, Israel would withdraw from Gaza population centres and Hamas would free hostages. The ceasefire would last an initial six weeks, with the ceasefire extended as negotiators seek a permanent end to hostilities.Jake Sullivan, Biden's national security advisor, said Sunday it was difficult to say how the rescue operation would affect negotiations on a ceasefire.""If Hamas came and said yes to the deal on the table, there would be an end to the need for these kinds of operations, because the hostages would be coming out peacefully and not through military actions,"" Sullivan told ABC News.In Egypt, Blinken is also expected to speak to Sisi about solutions to open the key crossing into Gaza at Rafah.The month-long closure has worsened the humanitarian disaster in Gaza, sending prices of scarce goods skyrocketing and worsening fears voiced by the United Nations of famine in the blockaded territory.Israel seized the crossing from Hamas and has blamed Egypt for the closure.Egypt, the first Arab state to make peace with Israel, has hit back and said that drivers feel unsafe going through what is now an Israeli checkpoint.Blinken was heading to the region from France, where he joined Biden on a state visit that marked the 80th anniversary of Allied troops' D-Day landing in German-occupied Normandy.Blinken will also visit two more key Arab partners, Jordan and Qatar, before returning Wednesday to join Biden at the Group of Seven summit in Italy.","US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is heading back to the Middle East to push a ceasefire plan.

Donald Trump floats tax-free tips in pitch to win Las Vegas workers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-floats-tax-free-tips-in-pitch-to-win-las-vegas-workers/articleshow/110858451.cms,"Donald Trump said he’d scrap taxes on tipped earnings for hospitality workers if he wins the White House , calibrating his message for swing-state voters in Nevada as he fights back after his felony conviction.“We’re going to do that right away first thing in office because it’s been a point of contention for years and you do a great job of service — you take care of people,” the former president said at a rally in Las Vegas on Sunday, his first since he was found guilty at his criminal trial in Manhattan.Trump’s latest tax-cut pledge signaled a bid to appeal to Nevada’s booming service industry dominated by young workers and people of color, two voter groups he’s courting as he heads toward the Republican National Convention in mid-July.The rally took Trump to a crucial state that President Joe Biden won in 2020, but where the president’s softening support among Black and Hispanic voters threatens to create an opening for Trump.“For those hotel workers and people that get tips, you’re going to be very happy,” he told the crowd. “Because when I get to office, we are going to not charge taxes on people making tips.”A Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll in May found support for Trump and Biden tied at 47% in Nevada. Trump led Biden by 48% to 44% among voters across seven swing states, including Nevada, that are likely to determine the outcome of the election.The Culinary Union, which represents workers in the hospitality industry, derided Trump’s pledge. While relief is needed for tip earners, there’s a “difference between real solutions and wild campaign promises from a convicted felon,” Secretary-Treasurer Ted Pappageorge said in a statement.The presumptive Republican nominee has stepped up campaigning after the New York trial largely kept him tied up in court, holding a town hall in battleground Arizona on Thursday and doing televised interviews. That follows a scaled-back campaign stretch with fewer rallies to preserve a war chest hit hard by legal fees.As a convicted felon running for president, Trump has thrust US politics into uncharted waters after a jury found him guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records to hide a hush-money payment to an adult film actress. He still faces three other criminal trials, but those are unlikely to take place before the general election in November.","Donald Trump said he'd scrap taxes on tipped earnings for hospitality workers if he wins the White House.

Nations in West Asia and elsewhere have also reached out to them.Recently, Abu Dhabi ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan had a meeting in Kabul with Taliban home minister Sirajuddin Haqqani, who also heads the Haqqani network, a powerful faction within the governing group.Kabul had approached New Delhi, through its deputy foreign minister Sher Muhammad Abbas Stanikzai, soon after the formation of the interim govt in Afghanistan in 2021. The correspondence between the two sides had opened a window for communication, which culminated into formal contacts.On the contrary, the ties between Islamabad and Kabul are growing more hostile every day. Kabul’s refusal to curb the alleged activities of Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants on its soil has seriously dented relations between the two countries. Travel restrictions on Afghan nationals and the expulsion of Afghan refugees from Pakistan further worsened the ties.Experts suggest that Kabul’s diplomatic efforts will not yield any results until they focus on solving problems such as human rights, women's education and employment.Sweden-based Afghan analyst Nur Rehman Sherzad said that since coming to power in August 2021, the Taliban govt has not formulated any foreign policy.According to him, a govt that is not officially recognised by any country does not have diplomatic and legal status in its relations with the international community and neighbouring countries.“The representatives of the Taliban govt are now gradually realising that the policies of the last three years are not bringing any significant results,” Sherzad said, adding that officials of the international community and other countries in the region visit Afghanistan also to inform Kabul about their security concerns.Describing the acceleration in the Taliban's diplomatic efforts, Arif Yusufzai, an expert on Afghan affairs, told TOI that these types of contacts help build mutual intelligence ties. According to him, the Taliban are making many claims on their own, but they are not doing what the international community is asking them to do. “They are not changing their behaviour at all,” he added.Afghan journalist Abdul Haq Omari believes that Taliban currently face two challenges for the survival of their power. One is to establish formal relations with foreign countries and the other is to maintain their religious narrative internally under which they had fought for two decades.“The survival of the religious narrative is important for the Taliban because if they withdraw suddenly, Taliban's rival groups in Afghanistan, Islamic State or Daesh Khorasan, may strengthen the anti-Taliban narrative,” he added.","Afghan Taliban has intensified its efforts to open different channels of communication with the regional and neighbouring countries.

Additionally, the deeply conservative culture makes it difficult to be openly gay.As a result, the man was transferred to the Sarhad hospital for psychiatric diseases in Peshawar on May 9. He faced significant abuse for his application from local citizens and politicians alike.As per the Telegraph report, the leader of the Jamiat Ulema Islam (JUI) party, a conservative religious group, claimed that the applicant's attempt to set up the club followed a recent return from the UK. A local MP from the far-Right Pakistan Awami Tehreek party expressed extreme opposition, stating he would have doused the club with petrol and set it alight, while the party leader, Naseer Khan Nazir, warned of ""very severe consequences"" if the club was allowed to open.Friends of the man, who were also unnamed, expressed fear for his well-being and reported being blocked from visiting him or obtaining any information about him. ""Everyone is afraid that talking about it will put them in danger,"" one friend said. ""I do not know about his well-being for many days,"" they added, noting their unsuccessful attempts to gather information about him.Before his hospitalization, he told the paper, ""I talk about human rights and I want everyone's human rights to be defended."" He emphasized his commitment to advocating for the rights of the most neglected community in Pakistan, saying, ""If the authorities refuse, then I will approach the court, and I hope that like the Indian court, the Pakistani court will rule in favor of gay people.""His application clearly said that there would be ""no gay (or non-gay) sex (other than kissing)"" at the club, with a notice on the wall warning, ""no sex on premises."" This measure was intended to ensure that no legal constraints, including the outdated anti-sodomy law PPC section 377, would be violated on the premises.","A Pakistani man who attempted to establish the nation's first gay club has been sent to a mental hospital.

Two members of Ahmadi community shot dead,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/two-members-of-ahmadi-community-shot-dead/articleshow/110826007.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Two members of the minority Ahmadi community were shot dead in Pakistan ’s central Punjab province on Saturday, days after a vicious campaign was launched against the Supreme Court order releasing a person from the persecuted sect in a 2022 case.

The incident occurred in Sadullapur area of Mandi Bahauddin district.

The victims, a 50-year-old man and another 25 years old, were targeted by an unknown assailant when they were en route to a nearby market.

District police officer Ahmad Mohiuddin said the suspected attacker has been arrested from the same locality and the murder weapon seized. “He was involved in both shootings,” he claimed.

Following the incident, a large police force was deployed in the area.

Police said they first took both bodies into custody and moved them to a local government-run hospital for post-mortem analyses, after which the bodies would be handed over to the victims’ relatives.

There are an estimated four million Ahmadis in Pakistan, a country of over 220 million people. They live in fear in a Muslim majority country due to intimidation and threats of death. A sustained hate campaign has been on against them for decades. The community’s members avoid revealing or speaking about their faith in public.

Over the last few decades, Pakistan’s minority communities have borne the brunt of mob brutality, bomb attacks, arsons, lynchings and other forms of violence. Last month, a district president of the Ahmadi community was killed by unknown assailants.

ISLAMABAD: Lawmakers in Pakistan's Punjab Assembly would now be able to speak in at least four indigenous languages , including Punjabi, in the house apart from English and Urdu after an amendment was made. A special committee of the Punjab Assembly, led by Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan, approved on Thursday amendments allowing lawmakers to address the House in Punjabi, Saraiki, Potohari, and Mewati in addition to English and Urdu, The Express Tribune newspaper reported.

Previously a member needed permission from the Speaker to use any language other than English and Urdu, which was not always granted.

The amendment in the assembly rules aimed to enhance accessibility for constituents who speak these languages, fostering a more representative and responsive legislative body, while the change reflects the multilingual nature of the province, enabling legislators to communicate and fully participate in legislative discussions effectively.

The Speaker stated that recognising and incorporating regional languages into official proceedings also demonstrates cultural respect and acknowledgement of the linguistic heritage of Punjab, thereby strengthening the connection between the Assembly and the people.

There is a controversy over whether Saraiki, Potohari, and Mewati are just dialects of Punjabi and separate languages. Those using them consider that these were separate languages but hardcore Punjabi brand them as dialects.","Lawmakers in Pakistan's Punjab Assembly would now be able to speak in at least four indigenous languages in the house apart from English and Urdu.

CAIRO: Britain's defence ministry said on Sunday a statement by Yemen 's Houthis that they had fired ballistic missiles at a British destroyer in the Red Sea was false.

The Houthis did not say whether the attack they said they had carried out on the HMS Diamond had caused any damage, but described it as ""accurate"".

""These claims are untrue,"" a British Ministry of Defence (MoD) spokesperson said.

The Houthis said they had also attacked two commercial vessels which they identified as the Norderney and Tavvishi.

The statement said the Tavvishi which was in the Arabian Sea and the Norderney had both been hit, and that a fire broke out on the Norderney.

The Houthi militia, which controls the most populous parts of Yemen, has staged attacks on ships in the waters off the country since November in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.

The campaign has disrupted global shipping, forcing firms to re-route to longer and more expensive journeys around southern Africa, and stoked fears that the Israel-Hamas war could spread and destabilise the wider Middle East.

The United States and Britain have carried out strikes against Houthi targets in response to the attacks on shipping.
