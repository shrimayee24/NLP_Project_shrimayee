How can she say such an irresponsible thing? Should women quit their jobs and sit at home? It seems Bengal is under the rule of Aurangzeb.""He further expressed a loss of faith in West Bengal's law and order situation and said he wanted to take his daughter back to Odisha for her safety.

Her life comes first, her career later,"" he added.The controversy began after Mamata Banerjee, while addressing the media about the crime, said, ""I learned that she was outside the campus at 12.30 am. Students residing in hostels should refrain from venturing out at night. Private medical colleges must ensure the safety of their students, particularly female students, who should not be permitted to leave the premises at night. Girls should protect themselves as well. ""Defending the police, Banerjee had said it was not possible for officers to monitor everyone's movements or stand guard outside every house.Her comments, however, drew sharp criticism from opposition leaders, women’s rights groups, and the Odisha government, who accused her of victim-blaming.Mamata later clarified that her statement had been ""distorted and taken out of context."" ""The media distorted my words. You ask me a question, I answer it, and then you distort it. Do not try this kind of politics,"" she asserted.The 22-year-old MBBS student was allegedly gang-raped on October 10 after she stepped out of her college campus with a male friend to get food.Police have so far arrested six people, including the friend, in connection with the case, which has triggered widespread outrage and political uproar across the state.","Mamata Banerjee is like a mother-like figure to me.

We can’t direct President not to act on governot-referred bills: SC to TN,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/we-cant-direct-president-not-to-act-on-governot-referred-bills-sc-to-tn/articleshow/124647173.cms,".

If guv was to test repugnancy of bills, then he should be in SC: TN

Delhi: Supreme Court on Friday spurned the Tamil Nadu govt’s plea for a direction to the President not to take decision on two bills — one to establish Kalaignar University and the other amending the TN Physical Education and Sports University Act — which according to the state were “unconstitutionally” referred to her by the governor disregarding the advice of council of ministers, reports Dhananjay Mahapatra.“We cannot pass an order preventing the President from taking a decision,” said a bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran when senior advocate P Wilson pleaded that the governor had acted in violation of the constitutional mandate to act in aid and advice of the council of ministers.Adjourning hearing on two writ petitions filed by TN challenging the governor’s decision, the bench said, “You would have to wait at most for four weeks to get a clear picture.” A five-judge bench led by the CJI had on Sept 11 reserved verdict on President’s Reference, questioning the jurisdiction of SC to fix time limits for the President and governors on granting or refusing assent to bills passed by a state assembly.Since CJI Gavai is retiring on Nov 24, the judgment would have to be pronounced before that by the five judge-bench, which also comprises Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar.The President had framed 14 questions related to jurisdiction of SC and the ambit of its exclusive powers under Article 142 after a two-judge bench led by Justice J B Pardiwala had on Apr 8 granted deemed assent to 10 TN bills pending for months before the governor.Appearing for TN, senior advocates A M Singhvi and Mukul Rohatgi said the governor cannot scrutinise the bills clause by clause to declare its repugnancy to central laws and refer it to the President.“If the governor was to test the repugnancy of bills, then he should be sitting in SC and not in Raj Bhavan,” Rohatgi said.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said governors, since the coming into force of the Constitution in 1950, have been testing the repugnancy of bills and it is not a recent practice. Moreover, he presented statistics before the court to show that only a minuscule of the bills sent to governors have been referred to the President.He said of the 6,942 bills sent to governors in all states since 2015, assent has been granted in 6,481 bills, 50 have been returned with a message to assemblies, assent has been withheld in 11 and 381 bills have been reserved for consideration of the President.","Supreme Court spurned Tamil Nadu govt’s plea for a direction to the President not to take decision on two bills. “We cannot pass an order preventing the President from taking a decision,” said a bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124647137,imgsize-42646,width-400,resizemode-4/screenshot-2025-07-15-152225.jpg"

Cong covered up Maoists’ atrocities: PM

New Delhi: “The success against Maoist terrorists, who committed unspeakable atrocities against Dalits, tribals and the youth, has been the cause of immense satisfaction in life,” PM Modi said on Friday, emphasising that this was the first time that he was speaking on the success of operations against left-wing extremists.“During the last 50-55 years, thousands of lives were lost due to Maoist terror. A large number of security personnel were killed. They would not allow construction of schools and hospitals, would not let doctors work. The situation was such that those who were supposed to provide security to others could not move without security. The writ of the govt did not run in the ‘red corridor’,” he said while speaking at NDTV World Summit.PM Modi termed Maoist terror an injustice towards youth. “Many joined Maoists as they were misled, while others were forced to follow them. I know many mothers who lost their sons,” he said.The speech was marked by a sharp attack on those “who call themselves the defenders of the Constitution but were indulgent towards Maoists who would not accept the Constitution in their spheres of influence”, as well as “Congress and its ecosystem, who along with urban naxals, used their control of institutions to ensure brutalities by Maoists did not become known”. The PM added, “The day is not far when the country is totally free of Maoist terror. This is also Modi’s guarantee.” He said ‘red zone’ has shrunk to 11 districts from 125 over a decade back due to his govt’s measures.","PM Modi said Maoist terror an injustice towards youth. ‘Many joined Maoists as they were misled, while others were forced to follow them.

Narendra Modi has once again compromised the country’s dignity. According to Trump, bowing to his anger and threats, Modi assured that India would stop buying oil from Russia. One thing is clear – Narendra Modi is a weak Prime Minister, and his actions have unsettled the nation’s foreign policy.Russia has always been a close ally of India. Don’t damage the country’s relationships just to improve personal ‘friendly ties',"" Congress posted on X.Trump claimed on Wednesday that PM Modi has assured him that India will stop buying Russian oil, months after he imposed punitive tariffs over the purchases.""He's assured me there will be no oil purchased from Russia,"" Trump said. ""You know, you can't do it immediately. It's a little bit of a process, but the process is going to be over with soon,"" he added.Responding to ANI's question whether he views India as a reliable partner, Trump said: ""Yeah, sure. He's (PM Narendra Modi) a friend of mine. We have a great relationship.. I was not happy that India was buying oil. And he assured me today that they will not be buying oil from Russia. That's a big stop. Now we've got to get China to do the same thing.""""He's a friend of mine. We have a great relationship. He just said that two days ago, as you know,"" the Republican leader added.Meanwhile, Russia remains India's single-largest source of oil, accounting for 34% of inbound shipments in September, although volumes have slipped 10% in the first eight months of 2025, according to commodities and shipping markets tracker Kpler.The agency’s latest report pegs India’s crude imports in September at more than 4.5 million bpd (barrels per day).This is an increase of 70,000 barrels over August but flat when compared to the year-ago period, says the report, adding Russian oil accounted for a tad under 1.6 million bpd, or 34% of crude imports. India’s overall crude imports in October have broadly remained in line with expectations at 1.6 million bpd.However, Russian crude shipments have seen a drop of 180,000 from the average volumes imported during the first eight months of 2025, says the report.The drop in the imports is purely driven by market dynamics and not because of US tariff threat and European criticism against India’s continued purchase of those barrels.","Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi on Thursday lashed out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Quoting the post, he wrote: “I would like to publicly state that I have no association or allegiance with any political party. The video being circulated is a fake, patched-up edit of an ad I did for @PrimeVideoIN.

Turning Point USA calls suspension of NBA employee over Charlie Kirk remark



Source: Outkick

What will happen to the NBA employee?



A controversy has erupted after an NBA employee was suspended for posting crude remarks online celebrating the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk . Turning Point USA, the organization Kirk founded in 2012, is now demanding that the league take stronger action, calling the suspension insufficient and urging for the employee’s immediate termination.The NBA confirmed that an employee was suspended for two weeks without pay after “violating multiple NBA policies.” The suspension came after the staffer mocked Charlie Kirk’s killing in a series of social media posts.In one Instagram story, the employee described Kirk as a “terrible person” and a “s---hole.” In another, they wrote, “Did absolutely nothing healthy for the world except spew dangerous rhetoric… There is no legacy,” before sarcastically adding, “Oh I also forgot to include ‘thoughts and prayers.’ LMAO.”Turning Point USA, however, believes that a short suspension does not go far enough. “The opinion of this team, and that of any decent American, is that if someone is morally depraved enough to celebrate the coldblooded assassination of an innocent husband and father, let alone an American hero like Charlie, then they deserve to be immediately fired,” a TPUSA spokesperson told OutKick , which first broke the story.They continued, “It’s an instant black eye to any employer who refuses to take action. This shouldn’t be newsworthy or exceptional. We hope the NBA doesn’t stop at suspension but goes the full distance and fires this individual, as they well deserve.”Kirk was killed on September 10 at Utah Valley University while speaking at a campus debate. He would have turned 32 this week. On that same day, President Donald Trump posthumously awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, presented to his widow, Erika Kirk.While the NBA has remained silent on the controversy beyond confirming the suspension, the incident shows a growing tension between personal expression and professional conduct in sports. Turning Point USA’s demand has reignited the ongoing conversation about the limits of speech in a private workplace and how public outrage can shape disciplinary action in today’s hyperconnected era. The employee is unlikely to be arrested as he is protected by the constitutional right to free speech; however, he could lose his job if the NBA agrees to TPUSA’s demand.Also Read: NBA employee suspended after celebrating Charlie Kirk's assassination online sparks outrage across America","An NBA employee has been suspended for two weeks without pay.

Pakistan Seeks Trump’s Intervention After Afghan-Taliban Forces Humiliate Pak Army In Border Clash





Pakistani airstrikes hit Afghanistan’s Paktika province, with attacks reportedly targeting residential homes in Argun and Barmal districts, according to Tolo News. A Taliban official speaking to news agency AFP confirmed the strikes saying that the ""truce has been broken"" by Islamabad.""Pakistan has broken the ceasefire and bombed three locations in Paktika"" the official told AFP adding that, ""Afghanistan will retaliate.""This comes hours after reports that the temporary ceasefire between Afghanistan and Pakistan was extended.A senior diplomatic source quoted by Pakistan's Dawn news had confirmed that the ceasefire, which was set to expire Friday evening, had been extended until the conclusion of the Doha negotiations.A 48-hour ceasefire was agreed between Afghanistan and Pakistan following deadly violence between the neighbouring countries.The truce, which began on Wednesday at 6:00 pm Islamabad time, temporarily halted nearly a week of intense border clashes that had already claimed dozens of lives, including civilians and soldiers on both sides.The violence began escalating on Saturday, following explosions in Kabul just as the Taliban's foreign minister embarked on a historic visit to India.In response, the Taliban launched an offensive along its southern border with Pakistan, prompting Islamabad to vow a forceful retaliation.Pakistani foreign office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan stated that it was essential to ""wait for 48 hours"" to see if the ceasefire held, although no further details were provided. Meanwhile, Taliban authorities remained silent when asked for comment on the situation post-ceasefire.Security concerns remain at the heart of the dispute, with Pakistan accusing Afghanistan of harbouring militants from the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a charge Kabul denies. Khan added that Pakistan expects ""concrete and verifiable actions"" from the Taliban to combat these groups operating from Afghan soil.Meanwhile, a deadly attack in Pakistan's North Waziristan district claimed the lives of seven paramilitary troops just before the truce ended, with a faction of the TTP claiming responsibility. The ceasefire's expiration also coincided with a deadly bombing and gun attack in Mir Ali, Pakistan, where at least one soldier was killed in the ensuing shootout.","Pakistani airstrikes hit Afghanistan’s Paktika province, with attacks reportedly targeting residential homes in Argun and Barmal districts.

FULL: Trump’s Shocking U-turn On Tomahawks After Putin’s Call | Watch Big Russia Announcement





US President Donald Trump met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Friday, a day after he spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The meeting came amid renewed efforts to end the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine.“It’s an honour to be with a very strong leader, a man who has been through a lot,” Trump said as he welcomed Zelenskyy. “We’ve gotten along really very well.” He added that his recent call with Putin had been “productive” and that he believed “something can get done” to bring peace between the two countries.Trump said both leaders Putin and Zelenskyy “don’t like each other,” calling the hostility “tremendous bad blood.” “These two leaders do not like each other, and we want to make it comfortable for everyone,” he said. “So one way or another, we’ll be involved in talks, but it might need to be in separate settings.”Asked about military aid, Trump expressed hesitation over supplying Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine. “One of the reasons we want to get this war over is that it’s not easy for us to give massive numbers of very powerful weapons,” he said.“Hopefully we’ll be able to get the war over without thinking about Tomahawks.”He added, “We’d much rather have them not need Tomahawks. We’re in it to get the war over. We’re not in it to sell weapons.” Trump’s comments came after Putin reportedly warned that supplying long-range missiles could escalate the conflict and make peace talks harder.The meeting, their third in the Oval Office and sixth this year, also included discussions on Ukraine’s proposal to store US liquefied natural gas in its facilities.Before the lunch, Trump briefly joked about Zelenskyy’s “very stylish jacket,” referring to their earlier tense February meeting where the two had clashed on live television.Zelenskyy thanked Trump for his Middle East ceasefire efforts and urged him to use that to help end the war in Ukraine. “With your support, we can stop the war,” Zelenskyy said. “Their army and economy are weakened, and this is a crucial moment.” He also noted that he had met with American energy and defence companies “ready to assist after the attacks on our infrastructure.”Trump, who has frequently described himself as a peacemaker, said, “I solved eight wars. I’ve saved millions and millions of lives.” Referring to India and Pakistan, he added, “That would have been a bad one. But we solved it.” He said he hoped to make Ukraine “number nine.”After meeting Zelenskyy, Trump took to Truth Social to call for an immediate end to the war in Ukraine. Trump said it is time to let each side “claim victory” and allow history to judge. He added that the war would never have started under his leadership and urged leaders to bring troops home so families can live in peace.He wrote: ""The meeting with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine was very interesting, and cordial, but I told him, as I likewise strongly suggested to President Putin, that it is time to stop the killing, and make a DEAL! Enough blood has been shed, with property lines being defined by War and Guts. They should stop where they are. Let both claim Victory, let History decide! No more shooting, no more Death, no more vast and unsustainable sums of money spent. This is a War that would have never started if I were President. Thousands of people being slaughtered each and every week — NO MORE, GO HOME TO YOUR FAMILIES IN PEACE!""Speaking to journalists outside the White House after meeting President Donald Trump, Zelenskyy said, “I think that Russia is afraid about Tomahawks, really afraid, because it’s a strong weapon.”","US President Donald Trump met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Friday, a day after he spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently backed President Donald Trump ’s plan to deploy troops in San Francisco. Joining him is now Tesla CEO Elon Musk who recently said that “This is the only solution at this point”. The tech billionaire was responding to a local advocate T Wolf's post citing a March 2025 survey where 61% of voters strongly support federal intervention to deport illegal fentanyl traffickers, rising to 83% including those who somewhat agree.The quoted post references SFPD's seizure of over 90 kilos of fentanyl in the past year and approximately 4,300 overdose deaths since 2020, aligning with official data showing 3,367 confirmed unintentional drug overdose fatalities from 2020 to 2024, with 2025 figures ongoing.“Pretty much 80% of San Francisco wants federal intervention on deporting drug dealers. That's how insane it's been here. 90+ kilos of fentanyl seized in one year by SFPD. 4,300 OD deaths since 2020. Hard data doesn't lie,” T Wolf wrote in the post. In another post, Wolf said “It's simple. If you want to keep federal troops out of San Francisco, remove the organized drug dealers and 80% of the problem goes away. If you don't, you reap what you sow.Replying to the post, Elon Musk wrote “It’s the only solution at this point. Nothing else has or will work.”In an interview last week, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said he supports former President Donald Trump’s proposal to send federal troops to San Francisco, a plan that city leaders have called unacceptable.Benioff said he “avidly supported President Trump” and backed the idea of deploying troops to help reduce crime. “We don't have enough cops, so if they can be cops, I'm all for it,” The New York Times quoted him as saying.Trump had reportedly discussed sending federal troops to San Francisco during an Oval Office meeting in August, naming it among several Democratic-led cities he said had been “destroyed.” He added that he would “clean that one up, too.”Benioff also praised Elon Musk’s DOGE initiative to cut federal spending and voiced support for venture capitalist David Sacks, who chairs Trump’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.San Francisco Democrats strongly criticized Benioff’s remarks.",Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently backed President Donald Trump’s plan to deploy troops in San Francisco.

A terrifying Halloween night unfolded in Alexandria, Virginia, when three mask-wearing intruders attempted to break into a widow’s home, threatening to kill the occupants, according to doorbell camera footage shared by the family.The incident occurred around 10 pm on Tuesday at a home about eight miles from Washington, DC. The homeowner’s daughter, Shayla said that at first she believed the masked figures — dressed as Michael Myers, a clown and a sinister-looking nun were playing a prank.“At first I thought it was just a Halloween joke, a little prank,” Shayla said. “So I said, ‘Happy Halloween.’”When the trio refused to leave, Shayla warned she would call the police however, the intruders continued knocking and pounding on the door.“They kept, like, knocking on the door. The knocks would get harder and harder,” she recalled.Doorbell footage shows the intruders demanding entry, shouting, “It’s either you coming out or we coming in. Open the door!” Shayla’s younger brother and the family dog were also inside the home during the frightening encounter.The intruders later moved to the back of the house, breaking through a wooden fence, slashing deck screens and banging on windows while peering inside, as reported by New York Post.Shayla described the moment as horrifying: “My heart dropped when they said they were gonna take a chair and break down the door. That is just too much.”After about 10 minutes of terror, the trio finally left, leaving the family shaken. “It’s not even a joke gone wrong. They tried to enter the home,” Shayla said. “My dad recently just died, so it’s like … I’m just glad I was there. But now she’s in fear. She doesn’t want to stay there by herself.”Social media users compared the incident to the 2013 thriller film The Purge, with some warning about the risks of escalating pranks.Reacting to incident, one user said: “Literally The Purge”. Another said: “They’re lucky they didn’t get shot.”Alexandria Police Chief Tarrik McGuire described the incident as a “very serious matter”, highlighting that the intruders threatened bodily harm and attempted to enter the home.Investigators are reviewing additional surveillance footage to identify the suspects, who may face charges including burglary and criminal threats.“They attempted to enter a residence, and under Virginia state law, that constitutes burglary,” McGuire said. He also reminded the public that homeowners have the legal right to defend themselves if threatened, according to Fox news.The chief urged parents to monitor children’s Halloween activities closely.“Know where your children are and what they’re doing. Talk to them about the decisions they are making. We don’t want to get police involved in something that did not derive from criminal intent, but this incident did,” he said.","Doorbell footage shows intruders demanding entry, shouting, “It’s either you coming out or we coming in.

Russia on Friday claimed that its forces have captured three villages in Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk and Kharkiv regions, reclaiming areas that Kyiv had retaken three years earlier during a surprise counteroffensive.According to Moscow’s military command, the seized villages include Pishchane and Tykhe in Kharkiv and Pryvillia in Dnipropetrovsk. The Russian army continues its slow, costly advance across eastern Ukraine, engaging in fierce battles for small, war-torn settlements left largely deserted since the conflict began in February 2022.This assault came just hours after President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump spoke by phone and agreed to hold a new summit. Trump also met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Friday amid renewed efforts to end the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine.Ukraine had regained control of much of the Kharkiv region, including Pishchane, in its rapid autumn 2022 campaign — a breakthrough that prompted Russia’s first military draft since World War II.However, Russian forces are gradually pushing forward again, seeking to encircle Kupiansk, a key logistics hub and one of Kyiv’s major gains from that counteroffensive.The prolonged offensive has claimed tens of thousands of lives and devastated much of eastern Ukraine, displacing millions of civilians.On Friday, authorities in the Russian-occupied Kherson region said Kyiv’s shelling killed two adults and a 10-year-old child in a residential area. Ukrainian officials, meanwhile, reported that one person died and 14 others were wounded by Russian shelling in the part of Kherson still under Ukrainian control.""Two adults and a 10-year-old child were killed during intense shelling of a residential area by Kyiv in the Russian-occupied part of Ukraine's Kherson region,"" the Moscow-installed governor said.Moscow also launched a wave of drone attacks overnight, deploying around 70 drones across Ukraine.

The United Nations has issued a warning that alleviating the famine in the Gaza Strip will require time and the opening of all crossings to ""flood Gaza with food"". The UN's World Food Programme (WFP) reported that nearly 3,000 tonnes of food have been delivered to the conflict-ravaged region since a US-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas was established.WFP spokesperson Abeer Etefa, speaking at a media briefing in Geneva, emphasized the challenges ahead, stating, ""It's going to take some time to scale back the famine,"" which the UN declared in late August. ""The ceasefire has opened a narrow window of opportunity. WFP is moving very quickly and swiftly to scale up food assistance and reach families who have endured months of blockade, displacement and hunger,"" she added.Currently, the WFP has established five food distribution points in the Gaza Strip, primarily in the southern region, with plans to increase this number to 145. Recent days have seen the use of the Kerem Shalom and Kissufim crossings to facilitate the delivery of aid. From Saturday to Wednesday, approximately 230 trucks carrying 2,800 tonnes of food supplies entered Gaza, according to Etefa.On Thursday, two convoys consisting of 57 trucks delivered wheat flour and nutritional supplies, which arrived safely at WFP warehouses and are ready for distribution.Despite these efforts, Etefa acknowledged that more aid is needed but expressed optimism about progress. ""We're still below what we need but we're getting there,"" she said.As of Wednesday, nine bakeries are operational, with plans to increase this number to 30 across the Gaza Strip. ""Bread is extremely important. The smell of fresh bread in Gaza is more than nourishment: it's a signal that life is returning,"" Etefa remarked.Etefa urged the opening of all land crossings into Gaza to facilitate the delivery of food supplies, emphasizing that quicker aid delivery would save more lives.

SHOCK MOMENT: Hakeem Jeffries TRASHES Karoline Leavitt In Public | ‘Sick, Out Of Control!’





White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Friday responded sharply to House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries, who had called her “sick” and “demented” following her comments criticising the Democratic Party, of which Jeffries is a member.Leavitt labelled Jeffries a “stone-cold loser” and accused the Democrats of ""lashing out"" because ""they know what I said is true.”“Hakeem Jeffries and the Democrats are lashing out because they know what I said is true. The Democratic Party’s elected officials absolutely cater to pro-Hamas terrorists, illegal aliens, and violent criminals. House Democrats voted against a resolution condemning Hamas following the horrific October 7 terrorist attacks, and Democrats cheered on pro-Hamas radicals as they hijacked America’s college campuses and harassed Jewish students,” Leavitt wrote on X.The White House secretary also criticised the Democratic Party for “opening our borders” and allowing “millions of illegal aliens into our country” over the past four years - a reference to the previous Biden administration - claiming the party viewed these individuals as “future voters.”""Democrats coddle violent criminals and support soft-on-crime policies like cashless bail that let violent offenders back on the streets to hurt law-abiding citizens.Democrats do NOT serve the interests of the American people. Now open up the government and stop simping to try to get your radical left-wing base to like you,"" she added.Earlier, Jeffries’ remarks were prompted by Leavitt’s comments during a Thursday appearance on Fox News, where she claimed that Democratic Party constituents include “Hamas terrorists, illegal aliens, and violent criminals.” The statement was in reaction to New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani’s refusal to call for Hamas to disarm ""You've got Karoline Leavitt, who's sick, she's out of control.

Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro has recalled how he once tried to deliver “bad news” to then-President and fellow Democrat Joe Biden ahead of last year’s election — well before Biden decided not to seek a second term.“I went directly to the president and spoke to him about what I saw were his challenges in Pennsylvania. I was really honest with him,” Shapiro said in an interview with The Breakfast Club, as reported by Fox News.He recalled meeting Biden at a coffee shop in Harrisburg. “He said, ‘How’s it going?’” Shapiro recounted. “I was very clear — polls were showing it wasn’t going well. I told him I didn’t think he was handling the cost issue properly. Rising costs were a major concern in the campaign, especially in Pennsylvania.”The 52-year-old governor added that he also told Biden that many voters “didn’t think he was up to the job.”""Look, maybe it's old school, but I believe that if you got something to say, you say it directly to that person's face, and he's the president of the United States. I respected him, still respect him, and I respect him enough to say it directly to his face,"" the Missouri-born leader remarked.Asked how his feedback was received, Shapiro replied, “I think he heard it. He told me that their poll numbers were different, and he seemed committed to continuing forward.”Biden had faced mounting pressure to step aside following a poor showing in a June 2024 presidential debate against Republican rival Donald Trump, a rematch of the 2020 contest.

Who is George Santos?





US President Donald Trump on Friday announced that he has commuted the prison sentence of ex-congressman George Santos, who is serving more than seven years in federal prison after pleading guilty to fraud and identity theft charges.“I just signed a commutation releasing George Santos from prison, immediately,” Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social. “George Santos was somewhat of a rogue, but there are many rogues throughout our country that aren’t forced to serve seven years in prison,” he added.Santos, a Republican from New York, admitted last year that he deceived donors and stole the identities of 11 people — including members of his own family — to make fraudulent campaign donations. He began serving his sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution in Fairton, New Jersey, on July 25, and had been housed in a minimum-security camp with fewer than 50 inmates.Following the announcement, Andrew Mancilla, one of Santos’s attorneys, welcomed the decision, calling it “the right thing to do.”""Very, very happy with the decision. The defence team applauds President Trump for doing the right thing.The sentence was far too long,"" Mancilla told The Associated Press.However, the timing of the 37-year-old's release remains unclear.The move comes just days after Santos sent a handwritten letter from prison appealing directly to Trump for clemency. “Sir, I appeal to your sense of justice and humanity — the same qualities that have inspired millions of Americans to believe in you,” he wrote. “I humbly ask that you consider the unusual pain and hardship of this environment and allow me the opportunity to return to my family, my friends, and my community. ”The son of Brazilian immigrants, Santos made history in 2022 as the first openly gay Republican elected to Congress. However, his political career quickly collapsed after investigations revealed that he had fabricated much of his personal and professional background.In 2023, he was charged with stealing from donors, misusing campaign funds, collecting unemployment benefits fraudulently, and lying to Congress about his finances. He was expelled from the US House of Representatives later that year — only the sixth member in history to be ousted by colleagues.","George Santos, a Republican from New York, admitted last year that he deceived donors and stole the identities of 11 people to make fraudulent campaign donations.

Presidency and Immediate Priorities

A leader in context





Colonel Michael Randrianirina, once a relatively obscure military officer, is now Madagascar’s most powerful figure. Days after leading his elite CAPSAT unit into the streets of Antananarivo to join youth-led protests demanding President Andry Rajoelina’s resignation, Randrianirina was sworn in as the country’s leader. His ascent, coming after a brief imprisonment for an alleged mutiny, has transformed a soldier from the southernmost reaches of Madagascar into the head of state.Randrianirina was born in 1974 in Sevohipoty, a small village in the Androy region of southern Madagascar. Little is publicly known about his family, but his career path reflects a steady rise through the military ranks. He served as governor of Androy from 2016 to 2018 under former President Hery Rajaonarimampianina. Following that, he commanded an infantry battalion in Toliara until 2022, before being promoted to a senior leadership role in CAPSAT, Madagascar’s elite military unit that previously played a key role in bringing Rajoelina to power in 2009.Throughout his career, Randrianirina became known for discipline and pragmatism. He was also a vocal critic of Rajoelina, contrasting with the president’s return to power in 2018 after having initially seized control through a 2009 coup.This tension would later set the stage for his decisive role in the 2025 political upheaval.Randrianirina’s relationship with Rajoelina turned openly adversarial in 2023. In November of that year, he was imprisoned without trial for allegedly inciting a mutiny and planning a coup, according to Reuters. He spent most of his three-month detention at a military hospital, reflecting the authorities’ recognition of his prominence and influence within the armed forces. Student groups, fellow soldiers, and politicians decried his incarceration as politically motivated, framing it as retaliation against a rising critic. He was released in February 2024, stepping out of prison to a country where the lines between military authority and political power were already dangerously blurred.The immediate context of Randrianirina’s rise was the wave of protests organized by young Madagascans, primarily a Gen Z movement known as Gen Z Mada. Angry at persistent water and electricity shortages, as well as high living costs, corruption, and lack of opportunity, the youth-led demonstrations erupted across the capital in late September 2025.Last weekend, as the protests swelled, Randrianirina’s CAPSAT unit joined the demonstrators. According to Reuters, he drove with troops into the city centre and publicly announced that CAPSAT was taking control. The Constitutional Court quickly ratified the transition, installing him as president even as the ousted Rajoelina refused to concede. In a statement to the BBC just hours before his inauguration, Randrianirina described himself as a “servant” of the people, exuding confidence and calm without arrogance.On assuming office, Randrianirina traded his fatigues for a presidential suit, complete with official sash and star of office, symbolizing the transition from military command to political authority. “We are committed to breaking with the past,” he told the BBC, promising to address the systemic causes behind the protests, including chronic shortages of water and electricity. He immediately launched an investigation into the state-run electricity and water company, signaling a hands-on approach.He has pledged that the military will govern alongside a civilian administration for up to two years before elections are held. In interviews with The Associated Press, he framed the takeover as an act of patriotism: “From now on, we will restore the country to its former glory, fight against insecurity, and gradually try to solve the social problems that Malagasy people experience.”Randrianirina also signalled a cultural shift, refusing to respond in French when offered the chance, asserting the primacy of the Malagasy language: “Why can’t I speak my language, Malagasy?” His stance reflects a determination to distance his administration from colonial legacies while asserting national identity.Randrianirina’s sudden elevation from prisoner to president underscores both the fragility and volatility of Madagascar’s political landscape. While the African Union and United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres have condemned the takeover as a coup, Constitutional Court president Florent Rakotoarisoa rejected this characterisation, arguing that structural constitutional flaws contributed to the crisis.Despite a minor clash with gendarmerie forces loyal to Rajoelina, during which a CAPSAT soldier was killed, Randrianirina’s troops were largely celebrated, and public support has been bolstered by youth who view him as the embodiment of their frustrations and aspirations. As Madagascar enters this transitional period, Randrianirina’s leadership will be defined by his ability to manage the balance between military authority, civilian governance, and international scrutiny.","Colonel Michael Randrianirina was born in 1974 in Sevohipoty, a small village in the Androy region of southern Madagascar.

VIDEO: Hamas Fighters Release Seven Israeli Hostages From Gaza Amid Loud Cheer From Palestinians





Hamas published a video on Monday showing eight blindfolded and kneeling men being executed in the streets, branding them ""collaborators and outlaws.""The footage surfaced amid armed clashes between Hamas security units and Palestinian clans, on the fifth day of a US-brokered truce between Israel and the militant group.Hamas proceeded to take control of Gaza on Tuesday, even as US President Donald Trump vowed to disarm the group under a recently brokered ceasefire.The Israeli military confirmed that the remains of four more hostages held in Gaza were handed to the Red Cross, following the release of four others and the safe return of 20 surviving captives.In northern Gaza, as Israeli forces withdrew from Gaza City, Hamas’s black-masked police resumed street patrols. Hamas’s Brigades helped control crowds when freed prisoners arrived in Gaza on Monday. A new Hamas security unit, called the Deterrence Force, has been targeting armed clans and gangs, some of which are said to have Israeli support.Hamas has dominated Gaza since 2007 after defeating rival faction Fatah. Israel insists Hamas must not play any role in a future Gaza government, hand back the remains of 24 deceased hostages, and eventually disarm.Trump has warned that those who refuse to surrender their weapons will be forcibly disarmed. The US-brokered 20-point peace plan, endorsed by world powers at a Trump-led summit in Egypt, demands a demilitarised Gaza and no leadership role for Hamas.Meanwhile, Israeli families continued pressing for the return of the remains of 24 hostages still held by Hamas.The Israeli army confirmed four more bodies were transferred to the Red Cross and on their way to custody. The military identified two victims as Guy Iluz, an Israeli national, and Bipin Joshi, an agriculture student from Nepal. Two others were later named as Yossi Sharabi and Daniel Peretz.Trump celebrated the ceasefire during a visit to Jerusalem with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and later joined regional leaders in Egypt to sign a declaration aimed at cementing the truce.","Hamas published a video showing eight blindfolded and kneeling men being executed in the streets, branding them ""collaborators and outlaws"" The footage surfaced amid armed clashes between Hamas security units and Palestinian clans, on the fifth day of a US-brokered truce between Israel and the militant group.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124561949,imgsize-395662,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has reiterated his call for the city to “honour” the International Criminal Court (ICC) warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over alleged war crimes in Gaza.The Indian-origin politician has previously stated that, if elected mayor, he would “arrest” Netanyahu should the Israeli leader visit the city.""I’ve said that this is a city that believes international law, and this is a city that wants to uplift and uphold those beliefs,"" Mamdani told Fox News’ ""The Story"" show on Wednesday.Anchor Martha MacCallum noted that the US is not a signatory to the ICC, which Mamdani acknowledged. He stressed, however, that “The ICC… has issued a warrant for the arrest of Benjamin Netanyahu, as it has for Vladimir Putin (over alleged war crimes in Ukraine). I believe that we should uphold arrest warrants by the International Criminal Court and that we would… do so only in abiding with all of the laws in front of us. ”The Democratic candidate clarified that he would not create new legislation to arrest Netanyahu. “I can tell you that I’m going to exhaust every legal option in front of me, not to make new laws to do so,” he added, responding to a question about whether the NYPD would allow him to arrest the Israeli leader.During his recent US visit, Netanyahu avoided flying over countries that are ICC signatories and could have arrested him in their airspace.Mamdani, 33, who would become New York’s first Muslim mayor if elected and is a vocal critic of Donald Trump, also declined to credit the US president for last week’s ceasefire and hostage-prisoner swap between Israel and Hamas. “To any extent, credit or not, I think it's too early to say. But if it proves to be lasting and durable, then that’s where you give credit,” he said.He also avoided commenting directly on whether Hamas would “lay down their arms” in Gaza, emphasizing that his focus is on justice, safety, and adherence to international law. “Anything has to abide by international law, and that applies to Hamas, the Israeli military, anyone you could ask me about,” Mamdani remarked.The mayoral election in New York is scheduled for November 4. Mamdani faces Republican Curtis Silwa and former New York state governor Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent.","New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has reiterated his call for the city to ""honour"" the International Criminal Court (ICC) warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Billionaire investor Bill Ackman, a New York City native, has called on Curtis Sliwa to withdraw from the city’s November 4 mayoral race, warning that a vote for the Republican candidate would effectively be “a vote for Zohran Mamdani .”Mamdani, the Democratic Party candidate, is the odds-on favourite to succeed Eric Adams, the outgoing 110th mayor of New York City.“If Curtis Sliwa drops, Andrew Cuomo can win. If he doesn’t, we are toast,” Ackman said Friday in a post on X. Cuomo, the former governor of New York state, is running as an independent in the mayoral election.Ackman also shared polling agency PolyMarket's latest predictions, which show Mamdani with nearly 90 per cent support. Cuomo and Sliwa trailed with 9 per cent and less than 1 per cent, respectively.The predictions came following Thursday's first debate between the three contenders.“It was not Zohran Mamdani’s debate performance. It was Curtis Sliwa’s statement after the debate that he is not leaving that has tipped the odds to 90 percent for Mamdani,” Ackman added. He has been backing Cuomo’s independent bid.Sliwa had stated after the debate that he would remain in the race.“Billionaires aren’t going to decide the outcome — it’s the voters. It’s the people. Let the people decide,” Sliwa’s campaign team told Fox News Digital in an exclusive statement, referring to Ackman.“Cuomo lost the primary as a Democrat. He’s now running as an independent.

Donald Trump's Critic John Bolton Charged, Former India Backer in Trouble After Slamming Tariff War

CHARGES AGAINST PERCEIVED ADVERSARIES





John Bolton, the national security hawk and former adviser to Donald Trump who has become one of the U.S. president's biggest critics, pleaded not guilty on Friday to charges of mishandling classified information.Bolton, who was indicted on Thursday , is the third of Trump's prominent critics to face prosecution in recent weeks, as the U.S. president dispenses with decades-long norms designed to insulate federal law enforcement from political pressures.Bolton, wearing a dark blue suit and maroon tie, did not speak with reporters as he arrived at the courthouse in Greenbelt, Maryland, to surrender.""Not guilty, your honor,"" Bolton, 76, said in court. He was released on his own recognizance and a hearing in the case is scheduled for November 21.The indictment alleges that Bolton shared sensitive information with two of his relatives for possible use in a book he was writing, including notes on intelligence briefings and meetings with senior government officials and foreign leaders.Bolton's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said Bolton did not unlawfully share or store any information.Trump, a Republican who campaigned for the presidency on a vow of retribution after facing a slew of legal woes once his first term in the White House ended in 2021, has actively pressured his attorney general, Pam Bondi, to bring charges against his perceived adversaries.That included pushing the Justice Department to bring charges against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, even driving out a prosecutor he deemed to be moving too slowly in doing so.Bolton served as White House national security adviser during Trump's first term, before emerging as one of the president's most vocal critics. Bolton, also a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, described Trump as unfit to be president in a memoir he released last year.The investigation of Bolton was opened in 2022, predating the Trump administration. Inside the Justice Department, the case is viewed as stronger than the prosecutions of Comey and James, according to a person familiar with the matter.The indictment of Bolton, filed in federal court in Maryland, charges him with eight counts of transmission of national defense information and 10 counts of retention of national defense information, all in violation of the Espionage Act.Each count is punishable by up to 10 years in prison, but any sentence would be determined by a judge based on a range of factors.In some of the chats described in the indictment, Bolton and his relatives - who are not identified - discussed using some of the material for a book. Bolton referred to the two people with whom he shared his daily notes as his ""editors,"" the indictment said.""Talking with (book publisher) because they have a right of first refusal!"" Bolton wrote in one message, according to the indictment.The two relatives referred to in the indictment are Bolton's wife and daughter, two people familiar with the matter said.Asked by reporters at the White House about the Bolton indictment on Thursday, Trump said: ""He's a bad guy.""",Bolton pleaded not guilty to charges of mishandling classified information.

That's...interesting,"" Trump said, when asked about the idea by White House reporters during his meeting with Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky.Indicating he had just heard about the potential cross-border project, he asked Zelensky: ""What do you think of that, Mr. President?... How do you like that idea?""The Ukrainian leader -- who has been combating a full scale Russian invasion for over three years -- appeared less than thrilled.""I'm not happy with this,"" he said, eliciting a laugh from his host.Russian President Vladimir Putin's international economy envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, brought up the idea on Thursday on the Musk-owned media platform X.He claimed the idea of a ""peace bridge"" between Russia and Alaska dated back to the Cold War era, and posted a crude graphic showing a proposed tunnel route under the Bering Sea.""With modern @boringcompany technology this can become a Putin-Trump tunnel,"" a 70-mile (112-kilometer) link connecting Russia to the Americas for under $8 billion, Dmitriev posted.The Boring Company is yet another venture by Musk, the world's richest person and boss of Tesla and SpaceX, which aims to revolutionize urban transport through the construction of tunnels.Dmitriev, who heads Russia's sovereign wealth fund, said Musk's company could build the tunnel -- a project ""symbolizing unity"" -- in under eight years.Musk was one of the biggest donors to Trump's 2024 campaign. After Trump returned to the White House, Musk joined the Republican's administration, with the president tasking him with making dramatic cuts to the federal budget, including laying off thousands of government employees.Trump and Musk were close until the latter left the administration in May. They publicly fell out in June, with Musk launching fierce attacks over Trump's economic policies.The two nevertheless appeared side by side on September 21 during a ceremony honoring slain conservative influencer Charlie Kirk.",President Donald Trump expressed interest in an undersea tunnel connecting the US state of Alaska with Russia.

CEO killer Luigi Mangione’s lawyers claim Trump administration is 'using him as a pawn' to advance its own agenda,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ceo-killer-luigi-mangiones-lawyers-claim-trump-administration-is-using-him-as-a-pawn-to-advance-its-own-agenda/articleshow/124646009.cms,"Trump Memo Sparks Uproar: Luigi Mangione Alleges White House Smeared Him As ‘Antifa Killer’

Mangione fighting 'full force' of US government alone





UnitedHealthcare involved with Trump administration?









The defence attorneys argued in a new court filing that public comments and social media posts have denied him the right to a fair trial.The 27-year-old faces federal charges, including two counts of stalking, one count of murder through the use of a firearm, and one firearms offence in connection with the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in Manhattan last December.In a letter submitted to a New York federal court on Friday, Mangione’s legal team said the government’s public statements are influencing public opinion and undermining the fairness of his case, reports NBC news.“Mr. Mangione is one young man, alleged to have acted alone, fighting for his life in three separate cases, against the full force and might of the entirety of the United States Government that is actively and persistently using him as a pawn to further its political agenda. This is the very definition of prejudicial where the consequence is death,"" the letter reads.The filing points to comments made by US President Donald Trump in a Fox News interview on September 18, in which Trump said Mangione “shot someone in the back as clear as you’re looking at me. He shot him right in the middle of the back — instantly dead. This is a sickness. This really has to be studied and investigated.” The next day, an X account affiliated with the White House, Rapid Response 47, and many more MAGA-based users posted a clip of the interview to millions of followers.Federal prosecutors told the court that the posts were removed once the matter was brought to their attention and that the officials involved are not part of Mangione’s prosecution team.Mangione’s attorneys also cited comments by Attorney General Pam Bondi in April, when she described the case as a clear death penalty scenario and said she had received threats over seeking the maximum punishment. “There can be no doubt that the Attorney General of the United States herself is 'associated' with Mr. Mangione’s case, as the Attorney General is the only individual in the DOJ authorised to seek the death penalty in any case,” the lawyers wrote.In addition, the defence has raised concerns over UnitedHealthcare’s interactions with the Trump administration, citing reports that the company increased lobbying efforts following Thompson’s death. “UnitedHealth’s continued financial viability depends upon maintaining the narrative that Mr. Mangione—rather than the company or its business practices—is the villain,” the filing states. The defence asked for information about these meetings to see if the White House and DOJ worked together in a way that could unfairly affect Mangione’s trial.Mangione was arrested at a McDonald’s in Pennsylvania days after the murder, following a nationwide manhunt. Prosecutors allege he was the masked gunman seen on security footage fatally shooting Thompson. The CEO was killed hours before UnitedHealthcare’s annual investor conference. A diary allegedly carried by Mangione suggested a plot to target Thompson. Mangione pleads not guilty in both federal and state cases related to the shooting.","Luigi Mangione, 27, is accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson last December.

ICE Protests Erupt In Chicago Suburb, Nine Arrested Amid Federal Police Clashes





The Trump administration on Friday asked the Supreme Court to allow the deployment of National Guard troops in the Chicago area.The emergency request followed a judge’s order blocking the deployment of Guard members from Illinois and Texas to assist immigration enforcement for at least two weeks. A federal appeals court refused to suspend the judge’s order.The Supreme Court, which has a conservative majority, has repeatedly ruled in Trump’s favour in emergency appeals since he took office in January, often overturning lower court decisions and over the objections of the three liberal justices. The court has previously allowed Trump to ban transgender people from the military, recover billions in federal spending, take strong actions against immigrants, and remove presidentially appointed leaders from independent federal agencies.In the case of the Guard deployment, US District Judge April Perry said there was no clear evidence of a “danger of rebellion” in Illinois during the administration’s immigration crackdown.Trump’s top Supreme Court lawyer, Solicitor General D John Sauer, asked the justices to intervene immediately, saying Judge Perry’s order “impinges on the President’s authority and needlessly endangers federal personnel and property.”Similar restrictions have been imposed elsewhere. A federal judge in Oregon temporarily blocked the deployment of National Guard troops there, while Guard units from several states continue to patrol Washington, DC, and Memphis, Tennessee.In California, a judge ruled in September that the deployment was illegal. By then, only 300 of the thousands of troops sent remained, and the judge did not order their removal.","The emergency request followed a judge’s order blocking the deployment of Guard members from Illinois and Texas.

FBI arrests Louisiana man; accuses him of providing materials to Hamas in deadly October 7 Israel attack — Who is Al-Muhtadi?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fbi-arrests-louisiana-man-accused-of-providing-materials-to-hamas-in-deadly-october-7-israel-attack-who-is-al-muhtadi/articleshow/124644494.cms,"‘Guns Won’t Fall Silent’: Hamas’ New ‘Warcry’ Amid Gaza Ceasefire Stuns Trump, Israel | Watch

Who is Al-Muhtadi?









The FBI arrested a suspect in Louisiana who allegedly participated in Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attack on Israel.An affidavit accuses Mahmoud Amin Ya-qub Al-Muhtadi, a Gazan and a resident of Lafayette, Louisiana, of violating federal law by providing, attempting to provide, or conspiring to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organisation through his alleged involvement in the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on Israel. He is also accused of fraud and misuse of visas, permits and other documents.Al-Muhtadi is expected to make an initial court appearance on Friday morning, according to The New York Times.“After hiding out in the United States, this monster has been found and charged with participating in the atrocities of October 7 — the single deadliest day for Jewish people since the Holocaust,” said Attorney General Pamela Bondi.“While nothing can fully heal the scars left by Hamas’s brutal attack, this Department’s Joint Task Force October 7 is dedicated to finding and prosecuting those responsible for that horrific day, including the murder of dozens of American citizens. We will continue to stand by Jewish Americans and Jewish people around the world against anti-Semitism and terrorism in all its forms.”“As set forth in documents filed yesterday, on October 7, when Al-Muhtadi learned of the unfolding barbaric attack on Israel and civilians from multiple nations, including the United States, he sprang into action.He armed himself, recruited additional marauders, and then entered Israel, where there is evidence placing him near one of the worst-hit Israeli communities,” said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John A. Eisenberg.“Subsequently, Al-Muhtadi fraudulently obtained a visa to enter the United States where he hoped to remain undetected. This arrest is the first public step in bringing to justice those responsible for harming Americans on that day.”Court documents allege that Al-Muhtadi is an operative of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine’s (DFLP) military wing, the National Resistance Brigades (NRB, also called the Martyr Umar al-Qasim Forces), a Gaza-based paramilitary group involved in Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks on Israel.According to the complaint, Al-Muhtadi armed himself and crossed into Israel on the morning of Oct. 7 to join Hamas’s assault. His phone was reportedly traced to a cell tower near Kibbutz Kfar Aza, the site of a massacre in which many civilians were killed, including at least four Americans.Al-Muhtadi is also accused of providing false information on his U.S. visa application regarding his paramilitary affiliation, ties to Hamas, training, and participation in the Oct. 7 attacks. Records indicate he entered the United States on Sept. 12, 2024.The case is being investigated by Joint Task Force October 7 (JTF 10-7) and the FBI New Orleans Field Office, with support from Israeli authorities including the Israeli Security Agency, Lahav 433, IDF, and the Israel National Bureau for Counter Terror Financing, as well as U.S. agencies such as Customs and Border Protection and Louisiana State Police.Prosecutors include Assistant U.S. Attorneys John Nickel and Zoe Bedell, along with Trial Attorneys from the National Security Division’s Counterterrorism Section. JTF 10-7, established in February 2025 by Attorney General Pamela Bondi, was specifically created to investigate perpetrators of the Oct. 7 attacks, hold Hamas supporters accountable, and pursue justice for victims, including the 49 U.S. citizens killed and eight abducted.","Mahmoud Amin Ya-qub Al-Muhtadi, a Gazan and a resident of Lafayette, Louisiana, allegedly participated in Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attack on Israel.

‘Doesn’t Wanna F**k Around With U.S.’: Trump ‘EXPOSES’ Maduro After He Offers Venezuela’s Riches





US President Donald Trump on Friday said Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro had offered major concessions to avoid confrontation with Washington.Trump’s comments came amid a significant US military presence in the Caribbean, which Washington says targets drug cartels linked to Venezuela. Earlier this week, B-52 bombers circled the Caribbean off Venezuela’s coast, while seven US Navy ships have been deployed as part of counter-narcotics operations. The build-up has raised fears in Caracas that the US may be seeking regime change.On Thursday, US forces struck a suspected drug-carrying submarine, leaving several people alive — the first survivors since the Trump administration began military strikes in the region last month. “We attacked a submarine, and that was a drug-carrying submarine built specifically for the transportation of massive amounts of drugs,” Trump said while hosting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio did not dispute the presence of survivors but said more details would be released later. The strike brought the death toll from the administration’s Caribbean operations to at least 28 and is believed to be the sixth strike off Venezuela since early September. The survivors are reportedly being held on a US Navy vessel.","US President Donald Trump said Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro had offered major concessions to avoid confrontation with Washington.

New York City Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani took a jibe at former governor Andrew Cuomo on Thursday, accusing him of failing to engage with the Muslim community during his decade in office.“It took Andrew Cuomo being beaten by a Muslim candidate in the Democratic primary for him to set foot in a mosque,” Mamdani said during a heated mayoral debate at Rockefeller Center. “He had more than ten years and he couldn’t name a single mosque at the last debate we had that he visited.”Mamdani continued, “What Muslims want in this city is what every community wants and deserves. They want equality and they want respect, and it took me to get you to even see those Muslims as part of this city, and that frankly is something that is shameful and is why so many New Yorkers have lost faith in this politics.”Cuomo defended his record, saying, “Before you were ever here, before you were even in state government, I worked with the Muslim community. Imams presided over state of the states. We worked in religious working groups, tolerance groups, anti-Semitic groups, etcetera.”Mamdani pressed further and asked, “Name a single mosque you went to while you were the governor. Can you name a single mosque you went to in ten years?” Cuomo had campaigned at a mosque for the first time in his current race last month.Mamdani concluded, “You couldn’t visit a mosque.”The debate, which lasted two hours, also saw Mamdani and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa teaming up at points to challenge Cuomo. Candidates clashed on housing, Israel and Gaza, sex work, and the influence of US President Donald Trump.Polls suggest Mamdani had widened his lead to 46 per cent, while Cuomo stands at 33 per cent. Early voting is set to begin next week.The Democratic Party is closely watching whether New Yorkers choose an establishment figure in Cuomo, running as an independent, or the progressive Mamdani. Republicans are also tracking Curtis Sliwa’s campaign, particularly his focus on public safety, to see if he can expand his support as a Republican in a Blue city.",New York City Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani took a jibe at former governor Andrew Cuomo on Thursday.

Mamdani with 'clenched jaw and erratic hand gestures'



An 'almost sickly' Cuomo

A 'relaxed and friendly' Silwa







NYC mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani tried to be tough during the first general-election mayoral debate on Thursday, in which he sparred with former governor Andrew Cuomo and Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa, a body language expert has said.The body language expert analysed all three candidates, revealing what they were truly thinking, not just what they appeared to be on stage.Carole Lieberman, a psychiatrist and body language expert, told The New York Post that Mamdani “was, ironically or purposefully, dressed in black like a villain.” She explained, “He was either showing his true colours unconsciously or wanted viewers to see him as tough.”The Democratic socialist, whose mother is an Academy Award-nominated filmmaker and father a Columbia University professor, has previously joked about calling himself the ""nepo-babyy."" But during the debate, he appeared “smug” and “angry,” showing visible signs of tension.“He also perpetually wore a cat-that-ate-the-canary, smug smile, as if he was already thinking about how he would decorate the mayor’s mansion,” Lieberman said. “He seemed angry, as if annoyed that he still had to debate to prove he’s the best candidate. His tense anger was made visible by his clenched jaw, erratic hand gestures and squinting.”In contrast to Mamdani, the body language expert said Cuomo “looked bedraggled,” or dishevelled, noting that the campaign took a toll on him.“He could pass for a homeless person on a Central Park bench,” she said. “He looks almost sickly.” By the end of the two-hour debate, Cuomo “looked worried” and “feared he hadn’t gotten enough of an edge over Mamdani.”The red beret-wearing Sliwa was described as the “most relaxed and friendly” of the trio. The Republican candidate appeared calm and open. “His wide arms, on either side of the podium, indicated that he was also the most open,” Lieberman said. “He was a welcome island of calm, a respite for viewers from Cuomo and Mamdani, who made viewers nervous.”The debate itself turned fiery, with the three candidates clashing over issues ranging from sex work to housing.","NYC mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani tried to be tough during the first general- election mayoral debate on Thursday, a body language expert has said.
