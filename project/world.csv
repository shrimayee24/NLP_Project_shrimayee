Since Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Moscow this year for the summit, it's Putin's turn to visit India for the next annual summit.""We are looking forward to the visit. The dates will be mutually worked out soon,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday, in a video interaction with some Indian journalists in New Delhi.India and Russia have so far held 24 annual summit mechanisms. The last one took place in July this year when Modi visited Moscow. The last time the summit took place in India was in 2021 when Putin visited Delhi.The annual summit didn't take place in 2022 and 2023 as Modi couldn't travel to Moscow, mainly because of Russia's preoccupation with the Ukraine war. If Putin does indeed come for the summit next year, it will be his first visit to India since the war started.Asked to comment on US President Joe Biden's decision to let Ukraine strike targets inside Russia with US-supplied longer-range missiles, Peskov said Russia's military capabilities are incomparable to those of Ukraine and it's unlikely that any missile will help Ukraine.Peskov's comments came on a day when Putin signed a revised nuclear doctrine declaring that a conventional attack on Russia by any nation that is supported by a nuclear power will be considered a joint attack on his country.","India and Russia have so far held 24 annual summit mechanisms.

NEW DELHI: Former Delhi minister and Najafgarh MLA Kailash Gahlot, who resigned from the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Monday, joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday. Gahlot criticised his former party for straying from its founding principles, accusing it of diluting the values that initially attracted members to its cause.Speaking to ANI about his decision, Gahlot said, “Dilution doesn’t happen overnight; it happens over a period of time. The values that drew me and many others to AAP have been compromised. I quit when I felt that the core ideologies of the party were no longer intact.”Gahlot, who had been a prominent figure in AAP since its early days, pointed out that the party was formed through the collective efforts of millions who believed in its principles. “A party is never formed by just one individual. It is built when lakhs of people connect to a shared ideology. Unfortunately, I saw those ideologies and values being diluted over time,” he added.The former minister also accused AAP of prioritising conflicts with the central government over governance. He said his departure was motivated by the realisation that the party had deviated from its original mission of ethical and transparent governance.""There are many others who share my concerns but haven’t mustered the courage to leave. I hope my decision inspires them to act according to their conscience,"" Gahlot said.Gahlot also commented on Swati Maliwal case, saying, ""I do not have knowledge of what transpired there but if any such reports come, it is unfortunate...Anything of this sort happening anywhere is wrong, especially with a woman and that too an MP.

Congress leaders remember the 'Iron Lady of India'



NEW DELHI: The Congress party leaders, including Kharge, and leader of opposition in Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi , paid homage to former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi at Shakti Sthal in New Delhi on Tuesday.Congress MP Rahul Gandhi shared a heartfelt tribute on social media, posting childhood photos with his grandmother alongside a message reflecting her influence on his life""Grandma was an example of both courage and love. It is from her that I have learned the real strength is to fearlessly walk on the path of national interest. Her memories are my strength, which always shows me the way,"" he wrote on X.Indira Gandhi served as India’s first and only female prime minister. Her tenure spanned two terms—from 1966 to 1977 and from 1980 until her assassination in 1984—making her the second-longest-serving Prime Minister after her father Nehru.Known for her bold leadership, she introduced transformative economic and social reforms, including the nationalization of banks and the abolition of privy purses for princely states. She was also instrumental in key national security decisions, such as the creation of Bangladesh in 1971.However, her decision to order Operation Bluestar—a military action to confront Sikh separatists at Amritsar’s Golden Temple—led to her assassination by her Sikh bodyguards on October 31, 1984, at her Akbar Road residence.Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge also paid tribute, describing Gandhi as the ""Iron Lady of India."" In a post on X, he highlighted her lifelong dedication to the nation.""Crores of Indians shall continue to draw inspiration from the life of ‘Iron Lady of India,’ Indira Gandhi, for she was the epitome of lifelong struggle, courage, and dynamic leadership. She sacrificed her life to preserve the unity and integrity of India.

Matt Gaetz: Elon Musk reacts to sexual offence allegations against Matt Gaetz: 'Less than...',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elon-musk-reacts-to-sexual-offence-allegations-against-matt-gaetz-less-than-/articleshow/115455528.cms,"Elon Musk supports Matt gaetz and reacts to the sexual offence allegations against Gaetz.



Allegations against Matt Gaetz: Explained

Amid mounting pressure to cancel Matt Gaetz 's nomination as the attorney general because of the sex offence allegations against him, Elon Musk extended his support to Gaetz and reacted to the allegations by calling them 'less than nothing'. ""Under our laws, a man is considered innocent until proven guilty,"" Trump's DOGE co-chief who is reportedly playing a major role behind Trump's picks said. Musk drew a comparison to present AG Merrick Garland and called him an ""unprincipled douchebag"".The DoJ did not press any charge against Gaetz and the House ethics panel started an investigation against Gaetz. But now as the attorney general to-be, Gaetz is not under the probe of the panel as he resigned from the Congress just days before the investigation report was supposed to come out. It's not yet decided whether the report will be published though a section of Republicans wants the report to be out.But Elon Musk said the case is closed if Merrick Garland didn't press any charge against Gaetz. ""If AG Garland (an unprincipled douchebag) could have secured a conviction against Gaetz, he would have, but he knew he could not. Case closed,"" Elon Musk posted.""Matt Gaetz has 3 critical assets that are needed for the AG role: a big brain, a spine of steel and an axe to grind. He is the Judge Dredd America needs to clean up a corrupt system and put powerful bad actors in prison. Gaetz will be our Hammer of Justice,"" Musk posted.""As for these accusations against him, I consider them worth less than nothing. Under our laws, a man is considered innocent until proven guilty,"" Elon Musk wrote evidently to defuse the situation.Gaetz won't become the AG if the Senate does not approve but Donald Trump may bypass Senate to install his picks.Matt Gaetz during his first term in Congress was accused of having sex with a 17-year-old and he reportedly paid the two women who testified before the House Ethics Committee when the probe went on for two years. Gaetz paid them through PayPal of Nestor Galban whom Gaetx calls his adopted son, reports said. Gaetz was accused of attending at least 10 drug-fuelled sex parties at the same time. At one such party, he was seen having sex with a 17-year-old. Gaetz denied all the accusations.“The allegation is — I read it in the New York Times — is that I’ve traveled with some 17-year-old in some relationship. That is false, and records will bear that out to be false. Providing for flights and hotel rooms for people that you’re dating who are of legal age is not a crime. … People were talking about a minor and that there were pictures of me with child prostitutes. That’s obviously false. There will be no such pictures, because no such thing happened,"" Gaetz said on Tucker Carlson show.Gaetz married his girlfriend Ginger Luckey Gaetz in 2021 after the probe opened against him.

Putin's Nuclear Order: 'Fire Missile On Russia, Face Nukes' | Doctrine Revised After Biden's Trigger

Russia announced on Tuesday that Ukraine launched six American-manufactured ATACMS long-range missiles into its Bryansk region in the west.Ukraine has not yet acknowledged using the ATACMS, which would mark their first deployment since President Joe Biden authorised Kyiv to use them against Russia, following persistent requests from President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.""Last night at 3.25 (0025 GMT) the enemy struck a facility in the Bryansk region with six ballistic missiles. According to confirmed data, American-made ATACMS operational-tactical missiles were used,"" the Russian defence ministry said in a statement.The statement also read that, Russian air defence systems intercepted five missiles and damaged one, with fragments landing on a military installation. The ministry further reported that whilst a fire broke out, it was swiftly contained with no casualties or structural damage reported.Later Russia's foreign minister claimed that ""Ukraine could not have fired long-range ATACMS missiles at its territory without US help"".This comes after Biden administration’s decision to grant Ukraine access to American missiles for long-range strikes on Russian positions, which Moscow condemned as a “reckless” move that could dangerously escalate the conflict. According to reports, Washington’s shift in policy was also driven by concerns over North Korean troops recently deployed to bolster Russian forces, a development that has raised alarms in both Washington and Kyiv.The Ukrainian foreign minister described the authorisation as a potential ""game changer"" in the conflict that has persisted for almost three years.Russia has indicated that the American approval for such attacks was irresponsible and would elicit a response.Earlier in the day, President Vladimir Putin approved a revised nuclear doctrine that reduces the criteria for considering nuclear weapon deployment. The updated policy states that any conventional attack on Russia by a non-nuclear state backed by a nuclear power will be interpreted as a combined assault.“They [the changes] have already been practically formulated. They will be formalised as necessary,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov had said.Additionally, it specified that any large-scale aerospace assault using aircraft, cruise missiles and unmanned vehicles breaching Russian borders could warrant a nuclear response.",Ukraine launched six American-manufactured ATACMS long-range missiles into its Bryansk region in the west.

Nancy Mace: 'Sarah McBride is a biological man': The transgender bathroom row rocking the Capitol,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/sarah-mcbride-is-a-biological-man-the-transgender-bathroom-row-rocking-the-capitol/articleshow/115456724.cms,"Who is Nancy Mace?



Who is Sarah McBride?



How the Trans issue became the Dem's bugbear



After Delaware elected the first openly transgender member of Congress earlier this month, a Republican introduced a bill aiming to bar her from using the bathroom aligned with her gender identity. South Carolina Republican Nancy Mace proposed the legislation, which comes just under two months before Sarah McBride is set to be sworn in as the first openly transgender member of Congress. According to The Hill, the bill would task the House sergeant-at-arms with enforcement, though the exact methods remain unclear.“Sarah McBride doesn’t get a say. I mean, this is a biological man,” Mace told reporters on Monday, according to CNN. She went on to say McBride “does not belong in women’s spaces, women’s bathrooms, locker rooms, changing rooms, period, full stop.”McBride responded on X, calling the matter a distraction.“Everyday Americans work alongside people whose life journeys differ from their own and interact with them respectfully. I hope members of Congress can show that same kindness,” she wrote.“This is a blatant attempt by far-right extremists to distract from their lack of real solutions to the challenges Americans face. We should be focusing on lowering the cost of housing, healthcare, and childcare—not manufacturing culture wars. Delawareans sent me here to make the American dream more affordable and accessible, and that’s what I’m focused on.”During the final stages of his 2024 campaign, many of Donald Trump ’s advertisements also focused on transgender rights. One high-profile ad criticised Kamala Harris for her 2019 support of gender-affirming care and included the tagline, “Kamala is for they/them, President Trump is for you.” NPR reported that the Trump campaign spent at least $17 million on the ad. Trump defenders on the other hand have pointed out that the ad wasn't aimed at trans people but at the left's obssession with pronouns.Mace was once viewed as a moderate Republican representing a competitive district in South Carolina. In 2021, she supported a bill offering limited protections for LGBTQ+ individuals in public life.“I strongly support LGBTQ rights and equality,” Mace told the Washington Examiner at the time. “No one should be discriminated against.”However, after Republicans redrew her district to make it more safely Republican, she shifted significantly further to the right. Earlier this year, the US Supreme Court upheld the gerrymandering of her district as legal, despite a lower court’s finding that Republicans had effectively engaged in “bleaching” by removing 30,000 Black voters from the district.On Monday, Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene also misgendered McBride in a now-viral video where she voiced support for Mace’s bill.“I support a resolution that keeps all biological men out of women’s bathrooms, locker rooms, and private spaces—not only in the Capitol complex and office buildings but all taxpayer-funded facilities,” Greene said.When asked how such rules might be enforced, especially concerning McBride’s position as an openly transgender member of Congress, Greene responded, “Which is a man. He’s a man. He’s a biological male. So he is not allowed to use our women’s restrooms, our women’s gym, our locker rooms, and spaces specified for women. He’s got plenty of places he can go.”Mace's actions have faced widespread criticism, viewed by many as part of a broader ""culture war"" strategy by some Republicans, centred on transgender rights. Critics, including McBride, have described the legislation as a divisive distraction from addressing pressing issues such as housing, healthcare, and childcare costs. Mace’s shift from a moderate stance to more conservative positions has been noted, particularly following redistricting that made her South Carolina district more securely Republican.This controversy forms part of a larger narrative involving increasing legislation and rhetoric targeting transgender rights across the United States, including restrictions on bathroom access and participation in sports. Prominent Republicans, such as Marjorie Taylor Greene, have echoed similar sentiments, using McBride's election to bolster their opposition to transgender inclusion.The issue has further highlighted the deeply polarised debate surrounding LGBTQ+ rights and its role in political strategies ahead of the 2024 elections.Nancy Mace has served as the Republican congresswoman for South Carolina's 1st congressional district since 2021. Born on 4 December 1977 in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, she made history in 1999 as the first woman to graduate from The Citadel's Corps of Cadets programme. Before her time in Congress, Mace served in the South Carolina House of Representatives from 2018 to 2020. She is known for her fiscally conservative views and her support for conservation efforts. In November 2024, she introduced a bill aimed at restricting bathroom access for transgender individuals within the Capitol complex, specifically targeting Sarah McBride.Sarah McBride, born on 9 August 1990 in Wilmington, Delaware, is a Democratic politician and LGBTQ+ rights activist. She earned her bachelor's degree from American University in 2013 and has been a prominent advocate for transgender rights. In 2020, McBride made history as the first openly transgender state senator in the United States after her election to the Delaware State Senate. In November 2024, she was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, representing Delaware's at-large congressional district, becoming the first openly transgender member of Congress. Throughout her career, McBride has focused on issues including healthcare access, reproductive rights, and LGBTQ+ equality.The culture war over transgender rights has emerged as a flashpoint in US politics, with Democrats finding themselves in a precarious position. While the party’s progressive base champions LGBTQ+ equality, including transgender rights, Republican attacks have weaponized the issue to energize their own voters and drive wedges between Democrats and key swing constituencies.Trump’s campaign has also leaned heavily into this strategy, spending millions on advertisements that mock Democrats' focus on pronouns and gender-affirming care. These attacks are not aimed at transgender individuals per se but at portraying the left as overly focused on niche cultural issues, alienating moderate and independent voters. Polls consistently show that many Americans remain uncomfortable or divided over policies like gender-affirming care for minors or the participation of transgender women in women’s sports—positions Democrats overwhelmingly support.This dynamic poses a challenge for Democrats. While their stance aligns with progressive values and human rights, it risks being framed as prioritizing ideology over the bread-and-butter issues voters care about, such as healthcare, housing, and the economy. McBride herself alluded to this, calling Republican attacks a ""blatant distraction"" from pressing national challenges.The culture war rhetoric also deepens divisions within the Democratic Party. Moderates fear alienating suburban voters, particularly women, who might otherwise lean Democratic but harbor reservations about certain aspects of transgender rights. Conversely, progressive Democrats argue that compromising on these issues would betray the party’s commitment to equality and justice.Ultimately, Republicans have used the trans rights debate to define Democrats on unfavorable terms, diverting attention from more popular Democratic policies. If Democrats cannot reframe the narrative—focusing on inclusivity while addressing voters’ core economic concerns—they risk losing ground in battleground districts where cultural issues resonate. As the 2024 elections loom, the question remains whether Democrats can effectively counter these attacks or if the culture war over trans rights will continue to erode their support.","Sarah McBride is set to be sworn in as the first openly transgender member of Congress.

Matt Gaetz Son: Did Matt Gaetz have a son before he married Ginger Luckey?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-matt-gaetz-have-a-son-before-he-married-ginger-luckey/articleshow/115456415.cms,"Matt Gaetz spoke about his adopted son Nestor Galban in 2020.

Gaetz paid for sex from Nestor's PayPal: Report



Donald Trump's attorney general pick Matt Gaetz is on the radar as he is one of the most controversial picks so far and many Republicans are hopeful that he won't become the AG as he won't get confirmed by the Senate. He was under investigation for having sex with a 17-year-old and paying for the sex. The House ethics committee report against him was to be published but he resigned from Congress after his nomination making himself outside the purview of the committee.Now it has emerged that 42-year-old Gaetz has an adopted son Nestor whom he did not hide from the world. He introduced his 'adopted son' Nestor to the world in 2020. Gaetz said Nestor was adopted from Cuba and he was only 12 when he arrived in the US from Cuba in 2014.The revelation came in 2020 when Gaetz had a fight with Democratic Rep Cedric Richmond at a House Judiciary Committee hearing about the need for police reform and raising children of color. In that fight, Richmond attacked Gaetz as having no experience in raising a child of color and as a riposte, Gatez introduced his adopted son to the world. ""Are you suggesting that you're certain that none of us have nonwhite children?"" Gaetz said. ""You're claiming you have more concern for my family than I do? Who in the hell do you think you are?"" Gaetz, who was 38 years old at that time, said during the debate.""For all those wondering, this is my son Nestor. We share no blood but he is my life. He came from Cuba (legally, of course) six years ago and lives with me in Florida. I am so proud of him and raising him has been the best, most rewarding thing I’ve done in my life,"" Matt posted.According to reports, Gaetz was dating Nestor's older sister at that time and then he adopted him as their mother died of breast cancer. But there were doubts about the claim as to whether Gaetz did not have any blood relation with Nestor, and whether Gaetz legally adopted him.Now Gaetz's adopted son came to the news as the lawyer, representing two women who claimed they were paid by Gaetz for sex, said that the women were paid from Nestor's PayPal. It was one of the payment modes, Florida attorney Joel Leppard said.Gaetz got married to Ginger Luckey in 2021 after the sexual offence probe opened against him and the couple has no children.",Matt Gaetz was under investigation for having sex with a 17-year-old and paying for the sex.

The list goes viral as Usher, Pink deleted their X posts and theories that Justin Bieber might have been a victim of Diddy float around. Nobody has been implicated in the Sean Combs case so far.P Diddy is facing serious charges of sex trafficking and racketeering where he forced women to have sex with male prostitutes that continued for days as the entire action was caught on camera.

A Romanian appeals court ruled on Tuesday to exclude key evidence in the human trafficking case against internet personality Andrew Tate , his brother Tristan, and two Romanian female suspects. The decision gives prosecutors five days to decide whether to proceed with the trial or drop the case.The court found legal flaws in the indictment and violations of defendants’ rights, ordering the removal of testimonies from two alleged victims and statements from the Tate brothers. It also noted inconsistencies, such as incomplete descriptions of alleged acts and improper explanation of charges to one victim.This development is a setback for Romania’s anti-organized crime prosecutors, DIICOT , who indicted the suspects in June 2023, with the trial initially slated to begin in April 2024.Andrew Tate’s attorney, Eugen Vidineac , called the ruling a “monumental victory,” stating it demonstrates a lack of substantiated claims. DIICOT has yet to comment on the decision.Tate, a controversial figure with dual US and British citizenship, denied the allegations in a video posted on X, claiming, “Every single thing in the file is a lie and the women lied.”In addition to this case, Romanian prosecutors opened a second investigation in August, accusing the Tates and others of trafficking minors, money laundering, and other charges.

The UK police have launched an international manhunt for Pankaj Lamba , the Indian-origin husband suspected of murdering his 24-year-old wife, Harshita Brella .Her body was discovered in the boot of a car in Ilford, east London, last week. The Northamptonshire Police suspect that Lamba fled the country after allegedly killing his wife earlier this month, with Chief Inspector Paul Cash confirming that over 60 detectives are actively working on the case.""Our inquiries lead us to suspect that Harshita was murdered in Northamptonshire earlier this month by her husband, Pankaj Lamba,"" chief inspector Cash said, according to PTI.""We believe he transported her body from Northamptonshire to Ilford by car. More than 60 detectives are currently involved in the investigation, conducting house-to-house inquiries, property searches, and reviewing CCTV footage,"" he added.The investigation began after Northamptonshire Police received a call on Wednesday raising concerns about Harshita's welfare. Officers were deployed to her home in Corby but found no response, prompting a missing person investigation .Their inquiries led them to discover Brella's body inside the boot of a vehicle on Brisbane Road, Ilford, in the early hours of Thursday morning. A post-mortem examination conducted at Leicester Royal Infirmary confirmed she had been murdered, reported Sky News.Neighbouring residents described Brella's home as a House in Multiple Occupation (HMO). One neighbour reported hearing loud arguments and furniture being thrown days before the incident, stating, ""She seemed like a lovely young woman... It's a shame to lose someone so young,"" Sky News reported.The Northamptonshire Police, along with the East Midlands Special Operations Unit (EMSOU), are investigating the murder as a "" targeted incident .""Detective Chief Inspector Johnny Campbell expressed condolences, describing the victim as a young woman with her entire life ahead of her. ""It is absolutely tragic that her life has been cut short in this way,"" he stated. The force is appealing for any information from the public that could help piece together the events leading to her death.As part of the investigation, the police are examining connections between Brella's disappearance from Corby, approximately 145 kilometres from London, and her body being found in the capital. They are also looking into previous domestic abuse concerns, with reports indicating that Harshita had been under a protective court order earlier this year.","Harshita Brella, 24, was found dead in the boot of a car in Ilford, east London.

An aide to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is accused of leaking classified information to foreign media to influence public opinion on hostage negotiations , according to information released by an Israeli court on Sunday.The Rishon Lezion Magistrate’s Court, Israel, said that the leak involved a highly classified military intelligence document given to Germany’snewspaper in September this year, The Times of Israel reported. The aim was reportedly to reduce public criticism of Netanyahu after six high-profile hostages were killed by Hamas in late August.The court identified Eli Feldstein , an aide to Netanyahu, as a key suspect in the case. The document was allegedly leaked to shift public focus on the hostage situation, hold Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar responsible for delays in negotiations, and suggest that protests demanding hostage releases were helping Hamas.Feldstein was arrested earlier in the month for leaking “classified and sensitive intelligence information,” court documents said.The court explained that the leak began when a non-commissioned officer (NCO) in the Israeli military reserves removed a “highly sensitive and classified document” from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). In April, the NCO reportedly sent this document to Feldstein.Feldstein later shared it with Israeli media outlets in September “with the aim of influencing public opinion on the ongoing negotiations concerning the hostages,” according to the release.Since Israeli media outlets were prohibited from publishing the leaked document due to censorship laws, Feldstein “decided to bypass censorship and publish the document in foreign media.”In September, two articles referencing the leaked information were published in the United Kingdom’sand Germany’s. Both cited Israeli intelligence sources and aligned with Netanyahu’s stance at the time.",Aide to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is accused of leaking classified information to foreign media.

The system has been classified as a "" bomb cyclone "" due to its rapid intensification.According to Richard Bann, a national weather service meteorologist, the most severe rainfall is expected between Portland, Oregon, and the northern San Francisco area. He cautioned about flash flooding risks at lower elevations and winter storms at higher altitudes, emphasising the storm's significant impact.Near Seattle and along the Oregon coast, hurricane-force winds exceeding 75 mph (121 kph) were anticipated.

"Out of picture: Biden, Trudeau and Meloni miss 'family photo' at G20",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/out-of-picture-biden-trudeau-and-meloni-miss-family-photo-at-g20/articleshow/115469057.cms,"Under sunshine and clear blue skies against a picture-perfect backdrop of Rio's iconic Sugarloaf Mountain, the Group of 20 leaders gathered for their ""family photo"". There was just one snag: US President Joe Biden was missing. The traditional photo opportunity descended into farce on Monday when Biden, Canada PM Justin Trudeau and Italian premier Giorgia Meloni were absent from the lineup.That only became clear, though, once Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva had posed for the snap with the other world leaders, after which they dispersed for further talks. Was it perhaps an act of protest against the presence of Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, who was standing in for President Putin? Or had some bilateral meetings run late? In the end, it seems it was down to disorganisation.A US official blamed logistical issues and said the ""family photo"" was taken early. Biden's absence wasn't an act of protest, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The Brazilian organizers say Biden and the others were late. They may try to herd all the leaders together again for a reshoot - which would be a first in the history of the G-20.But the symbolism was unmistakable. The West appeared in disarray. That allowed China's Xi Jinping to stroll in and take center stage. Brazil's Lula was flanked by the previous G20 host - India's Narendra Modi - and the next one - South Africa's Cyril Ramaphosa. Argentina's Javier Milei, who has been a thorn in Lula's side, was lurking just behind him and next to France's Emmanuel Macron. Lavrov was safely tucked away at the back next to his Saudi counterpart.UK PM Keir Starmer walked out into the sun alone. Earlier he'd irked Xi by publicly chiding China on human rights and Taiwan. The chill between the two was palpable as they studiously avoided contact, separated only by Australian PM Anthony Albanese.The adage that a picture is worth a thousand words couldn't be truer when it comes to the annual G20 family photo. Since its foundation in 1999, this snapshot in time tells the story of the rise and fall of collaboration between the world's most powerful economies.The plan today was to invite everyone and paper over the cracks in global diplomacy. Lula literally hoped to drown out the differences by having more people in the frame. Instead, as Xi was holding hands with fellow leaders and smiling, Meloni came to realise she and Trudeau were missing out. As per a pool report, she gasped and said ""The photo!""","The traditional photo opportunity descended into farce on Monday.

""The people deeply respect the office of the president, are mindful of the demands and obligations of the presidency, and acknowledge that defendant's inauguration will raise unprecedented legal questions,"" prosecutors from the Manhattan district attorney's office wrote to the judge, Juan Merchan. ""We also deeply respect the fundamental role of the jury in our constitutional system.""Eager to clear his criminal record, Trump is now expected to move forcefully for a dismissal, setting in motion a legal battle that could shadow his second presidential term and ultimately reach the US Supreme Court. That fight will almost certainly further delay Trump's sentencing, which was scheduled for next week.In court records last week that hinted at a Supreme Court challenge, Trump's lawyers argued that dismissing the case would ""avoid unconstitutional impediments to Trump's ability to govern."" Doing so, they added, was ""in the interests of justice.""The district attorney, Alvin L Bragg, took a week to deliberate before delivering Tuesday's much-anticipated response. His options were limited and unappealing: He could have either dropped the case, a move that would have alienated his liberal Manhattan base, or proposed some way to pause it, potentially intensifying Trump's ire and drawing a legal challenge. Ultimately, Bragg, the first prosecutor in the country to indict and convict a former president, opted to stand behind the jury's verdict.","Manhattan prosecutors rebuffed Donald Trump's request to dismiss his criminal conviction.

Putin approves updated Russian nuclear doctrine: All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/russia-updates-nuclear-doctrine-day-after-us-allows-ukraine-to-use-their-missiles/articleshow/115445923.cms,"Putin's Nuclear Order: 'Fire Missile On Russia, Face Nukes' | Doctrine Revised After Biden's Trigger

MOSCOW: Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday approved an updated nuclear doctrine that positions any conventional attack on Russia, when supported by a nuclear-armed ally, as a joint assault on the country.This change comes amid heightened concerns over Western involvement in the Ukraine conflict, with Kremlin officials citing the doctrine as a necessary response to recent US military support for Ukraine .According to the official document published on the government website, the revised policy stresses Moscow’s intent to protect its national security as Western nations expand military backing to Kyiv.Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told TASS that these revisions “have already been practically formulated” and will “be formalised as necessary.” Peskov highlighted Moscow’s unease following Washington’s approval for Ukraine to use US-supplied missiles against Russian military targets.“They [the changes] have already been practically formulated. They will be formalised as necessary,” Peskov said.The Kremlin responded to reports that Ukraine may use US-supplied ATACMS missiles in Russia's Kursk region, with assurances that “our military is monitoring the situation very closely.” In response to concerns that Russia might initiate nuclear action, the Kremlin reiterated its position: “Russia has always viewed nuclear weapons as a means of deterrence, an extreme measure,” intended only for the most severe circumstances.This policy update follows the Biden administration’s decision to grant Ukraine access to American missiles for long-range strikes on Russian positions, which Moscow condemned as a “reckless” move that could dangerously escalate the conflict. The Kremlin has vowed to respond to what it views as a direct provocation.In comments made in September, Putin had warned that any Western endorsement of Ukraine’s use of long-range missiles would mean “the direct involvement of Natocountries, the United States, and European countries in the war in Ukraine,” noting the reliance on Nato’s military personnel and targeting infrastructure.The US decision to support these Ukrainian strikes comes after months of appeals from President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has argued for additional firepower to strike Russian targets within his country’s borders. According to reports, Washington’s shift in policy was also driven by concerns over North Korean troops recently deployed to bolster Russian forces, a development that has raised alarms in both Washington and Kyiv.The Kremlin’s revised nuclear policy was finalised just weeks ahead of the November US presidential election, further escalating tensions in a conflict that many analysts see as the most dangerous standoff between Moscow and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.On Tuesday, Peskov indicated that while Russia is open to improving relations with the United States, mutual cooperation is essential. “We are ready to normalise ties with Washington,” he said. “But we cannot tango alone, and we are not going to do it.”","Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday approved an updated nuclear doctrine.

(Not yet, at least.) Nor, to be honest, is it a dance.What is certain, however, is that the president-elect's signature shimmy is en vogue with all manner of professional athletes, imitated by at least five NFL players Sunday, as well as by Jon Jones, the heavyweight champion of the UFC, who seemingly helped spread the fad Saturday after knocking out Stipe Miocic in the third round.Jones celebrated by rocking from hip to hip and pumping his fists at waist level - both hallmarks of Trump's dancing - before pointing his finger at Trump, who was sitting ringside at the fight in New York. Trump, never one to pass up a compliment, beamed in the moment and soon reposted Jones' performance on Truth Social. Trump's embrace of events like UFC fights and football games - both brimming with machismo - was viewed during the campaign as part of a broader effort to appeal to young men.The support of Trump's moves from prominent athletes came after he had trailed his opponent, vice president Kamala Harris, in terms of big-name celebrity endorsements. His resounding victory November 5, however, has resulted in an increasing trickle of congratulations from famous people - a diverse cohort including the likes of Caitlyn Jenner and Sylvester Stallone. Jones and the NFL players expanded that circle even more.Trump's physical enjoyment of music has been a staple of his campaigns for years, including at an Oct town hall where a pair of medical emergencies in the crowd led to lengthy delays, during which the Republican candidate bobbed his head to the Village People's ""Y.M.C.A"".Both simple and strangely hypnotic, Trump's wiggle incorporates the kind of stiff swivel often employed by arrhythmic wedding guests or awkward, one-too-many conventioneers. Sunday saw more variations emerging, from NFL players like Brock Bowers who did a quick end zone dance with the Trumpian boogie. ""I saw it and thought it was cool,"" he said.While Trump is the dance's originator, various sources credit another NFL player - Nick Bosa - for its broader popularisation, after he did Trump's dance on November 10 in the wake of a sack. A day before, Bosa had been fined $11,255 for violating a rule by wearing a ""MAGA"" hat at a post-game, pre-election TV interview. Of his fine, Bosa said, ""It was well worth it"".",Donald Trump's signature shimmy is en vogue with all manner of professional athletes. At least five NFL players imitated Trump's dance Sunday.

His attorney requested the judge for its removal as it would prejudice the jury.



Diddy's cell was raided, documents seized

Sean Diddy will now appear in court without any shackles on him, judge Arun Subramanian granted the request of Diddy's attorney Marc Agnifilo who said shackles which were seen on Diddy's leg earlier could prejudice the jury. ""A defendant may not be tried in shackles unless the trial judge finds on the record that it is necessary to use such a restraint as a last resort to satisfy a compelling interest such as preserving the safety of persons in the courtroom,"" Diddy's attorney cited United States v Haynes case.The lawyer said the shackling could undermine the ""presumption of innocence"" and interfere with Diddy's ability to communicate effectively with his legal team during proceedings.The judge granted the request ahead of Diddy's appearance today at 3pm EST for an emergent hearing.Diddy's cell was raided and documents were seized based on which the prosecutors claimed that Diddy was contacting complainants through a third party; he also used the telephone of other inmates. Diddy's lawyers said it was outrageous government conduct to use the materials seized from his jail cell against him. They said that information was cited in papers the government filed in Manhattan federal court so that Diddy is locked up before his May 5 trial. It was in this regard that they sought an emergency hearing today.The prosecutors responded and said the raid in Combs' cell was part of a jail-wide safely-related sweep and had nothing to do with Diddy's prosecution specifically. They said the raid was planned even before Combs was arrested and was properly carried out with an investigator who entered Combs' cell and did not examine the envelope which had ""legal"" written on it.They added that any potentially privileged materials were viewed first by a “filter team” of government lawyers not working on the case. The team was tasked with weeding out any confidential communications protected by attorney-client privilege so that trial prosecutors couldn’t see them.",Diddy's cell was raided and documents were seized based on which the prosecutors claimed that Diddy was contacting complainants through a third party; he also used the telephone of other inmates.

A man, Brandon Durham, was shot and killed by police in his own house in Las Vegas , Nevada, US, after calling 911 to report a potential home invasion. The incident occurred early on November 12, when Durham, 43, was reportedly struggling with an intruder, later identified as 31-year-old Alejandra Boudreaux, over a knife.Bodycam footage released by the Las Vegas Metro Police Department shows a confrontation between Durham and Boudreaux, with Boudreaux wearing a red hoodie and Durham shirtless.On the morning of November 12, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police received multiple 911 calls about a shooting on Wine River Drive. Durham, who was at home with his 15-year-old daughter, told the dispatcher that someone had broken into his house and was shooting at him, according to assistant sheriff Dori Koren.When Officer Alexander Bookman and two other officers arrived, they saw damaged cars and windows and heard loud noises and screams from inside Durham's home. Bookman forcibly entered the front door and, upon entering, found Durham and Boudreaux struggling over a knife in a bedroom doorway. Durham's daughter was not present during the struggle.Bookman ordered them to drop the knife and fired his weapon, striking Durham, causing him to fall to the floor. The officer then discharged five more rounds, fatally shooting Durham.Durham's family is now demanding answers. His daughter, Isabella, spoke out in a press conference, saying, ""He called the police for safety, and instead, he was brutally murdered."" Durham's mother also expressed grief, asking, ""Someone needs to explain to me why my son is not here with us today.""Officer Bookman has been placed on paid administrative leave while the Las Vegas Metro Police Department investigates whether his use of force was justified. The investigation could take between 30 to 90 days, according to Clark County district attorney Steve Wolfson.Experts are raising concerns about the officer's actions. Felipe Rodriguez, an adjunct professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and former NYPD detective, stressed that police officers must be able to justify their use of force, particularly when multiple shots are fired after a suspect is down.Meanwhile, Boudreaux has been arrested and faces several charges, including home invasion with a deadly weapon, assault with a deadly weapon, and child abuse.Police reports indicate that Boudreaux and Durham were known to each other and had a sexual relationship. Boudreaux reportedly told detectives that she intended to provoke police into killing her during the home invasion. She has since refused to attend two court hearings.","Brandon Durham, 43, called 911 to report a potential home invasion in Las Vegas, Nevada.

He also decried the “enforced disappearances, brutality, and violence” against PTI workers.Khan’s statement followed his wife Bushra Bibi’s recent warning to PTI politicians about tickets for the next general election. “The party tickets for the next general elections are linked with the performance of the PTI leadership during the upcoming protest in Islamabad,” she said, describing it as Imran’s message to the party leadership.On Monday, PTI had announced it would not end its sit-in until its stolen mandate was returned, the constitution restored, and Imran set free.","Khan urges everyone to join the protest on November 24. “The nation will not accept any excuse at such a critical time,” he said.

Extortions bleed Pak’s terror-stalked northwest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/extortions-bleed-paks-terror-stalked-northwest/articleshow/115454371.cms,"TOI

ISLAMABAD: Surging terror and extortions have endangered public safety in Pakistan ’s restive northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where militants in several districts run a parallel shadow administration.The southern districts of the province have almost become no-go areas even for law-enforcers. In the evening, militants are seen patrolling the streets and setting up checkpoints in Bannu, North and South Waziristan, Tank, Lakki Marwat, and Dera Ismail Khan regions.While these districts remain at mercy of militants from evening to morning, well-off people in other districts of the province frequently receive threatening WhatsApp texts and letters from Pakistani Taliban -- or Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) -- with demands to pay or face attacks. The ones who refuse to pay ransom are often targeted with grenade attacks at their homes, shops and warehouses, apparently to show the group was serious about its threats.Faisal Khan, a lawyer in Umerzai area in Charsadda district, toldthat he had received a threatening WhatsApp text earlier this month from an Afghanistan number with a demand to pay $50,000 (Pak Rs 1.4cr).Khan claims that after reporting the threats to the police, he went to high-ranking officers to request protection and assistance. Most official discussions, he said, concluded with cautious assurances.“A family goes through pain for months after such a call. Even after approaching the cops, the victims are normally asked to install CCTV cameras, restrict movement and take care of security themselves,” Khan said. He also revealed that he was cautioned by “allies in the govt” that he “should not count” on them to keep him safe. “Either pay up or move your family to Islamabad or Lahore,” he said in reference to a private communication with some officials after he pressed for assistance.Last week, Khan said he had received a parcel carrying a shroud and other items required before burials. “This was followed by a threatening message to vacate my home within 30 minutes,” Khan said, adding he has refused to pay the extortioners.However, Shahzaib, another person in the same neighbourhood who had received a similar text on TTP’s letterhead last month, has paid after negotiating a deal through intermediaries. He eventually paid a reduced part of the $50,000 the militants initially demanded.“The key thing I learnt was that TTP is demanding extortion from everyone they think can pay. Most, if not all, wealthy individuals have already paid,” Shahzaib said.According to police, the main hurdle for law-enforcers in tracking down extortionists is the calls which they make from non-local lines, internet-generated resources, illegal gateways and Whatsapp numbers.Apart from various groups, the police said, criminal rings are also found involved in many such calls. In the last two years, police sources said at least 1,600 Afghan phone numbers and 387 illegal gateways were used for making extortion calls. These numbers and illegal gateways, according to the police, have been shared with higher authorities for follow-up action. “Despite the alarming increase in Taliban extortion demands, the issue has yet to attract national attention,” a senior police official said.","The southern districts of the province have almost become no-go areas even for law-enforcers.

Eight soldiers were killed and seven police officers abducted in separate incidents in northwest Pakistan on Tuesday, officials told news agency AFP. The Pakistani Taliban has claimed responsibility for the assaults.The first attack occurred on Monday, where a clash between security forces and militants left ""eight soldiers"" and ""nine militants"" dead, according to an intelligence official who spoke anonymously.In a separate incident, seven police officers were abducted, a senior police official confirmed.These incidents follow a series of recent militant operations in Pakistan. Just last week, seven paramilitary soldiers were killed in an attack by Baloch separatists on a border post in Balochistan province . The same group, the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), was responsible for a deadly railway station bombing earlier this year that killed 26 people, including 14 soldiers.Militant groups like the BLA and the Pakistani Taliban frequently target security forces and infrastructure, claiming to fight for autonomy or ideological goals. Their activities have disrupted economic projects, particularly those involving foreign investment, such as Chinese-backed ventures in Balochistan.Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has condemned these attacks, vowing swift action against the perpetrators.","Pakistani Taliban claims responsibility for two attacks in northwest Pakistan.

The arrested include the mother-in-law, Sughran Bibi; her daughter, Yasmin; her grandson, Hamza; and a distant relative, Navid.Senior police officer Omar Farooq informed reporters that the suspects have confessed to killing Zara and dismembering her body.Zara Qadir, a woman in her 20s, went missing last week, and later, police discovered her dismembered body in three sacks, which was identified as hers.Zara, who was the daughter of a police officer, had married Qadir Ahmad four years ago, and they had a three-year-old son. She went to Saudi Arabia after her marriage and returned to Pakistan only a few months ago.Farooq said, ""In her confessional statement, Sughran Bibi said that she suspected Zara of allegedly practicing 'witchcraft,' and besides, her son Qadir had started sending money directly to Zara's bank account instead of to his mother.""He added that the four suspects smothered the pregnant Zara with a pillow while she was asleep and then proceeded to burn her face.

DHAKA: The International Crimes Tribunal (Bangladesh), a domestic war crimes body, directed the prosecution on Monday to complete its investigation against ousted PM Sheikh Hasina and 13 others in a genocide case by December 17. They face charges of crimes against humanity related to the July-Aug uprising that resulted in hundreds of deaths.The three-member ICT, led by Justice Md Golam Mortuza Mozumder, had issued an arrest warrant for Hasina on October 17 in connection with her alleged role in ""crimes against humanity"" and ""genocide"". Chief prosecutor Muhammad Tajul Islam stated that Hasina ""had superior command responsibility"" over numerous killings, acts of genocide, and crimes against humanity committed in the country over the past 16.5 years of her tenure.Authorities have been unable to execute the arrest warrant as Hasina ""fled the country"". Tajul said, ""We have pleaded for the issuance of an Interpol red notice against her. We have learned that she is in India, and our govt will request her repatriation in accordance with the bilateral agreement. The process is underway.""Bangladesh Nationalist Party expressed disappointment over interim govt chief adviser Muhammad Yunus 's address to the nation, saying he had failed to give a ""clear outline"" for upcoming elections. BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir said his party had expected Yunus to identify key problems and propose a roadmap for elections that ""would reflect the people's aspirations"".",Bangladesh Nationalist Party expresses disappointment over interim govt chief adviser Muhammad Yunus's address to the nation.

"King Charles Cancer Treatment: Cancer, Prince William, and Prince Andrew: Why King Charles is struggling",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/cancer-prince-william-and-prince-andrew-why-king-charles-is-struggling/articleshow/115456259.cms,"(Pic courtesy: X/ @RoyalFamily

King Charles, reportedly battling cancer, faces increasing challenges within the royal family as tensions with his son, Prince William, and brother, Prince Andrew, escalate. Recent reports suggest that family divisions are straining efforts to maintain unity during his reign.Prince William recently sparked controversy with a public critique of royal leadership. In an interview during his trip to South Africa for the Earthshot Prize, the Prince of Wales outlined his vision for a modernized monarchy focused on impact, philanthropy, and collaboration. While William emphasized doing things differently for his generation, the remarks were interpreted as a thinly veiled criticism of his father's approach to governance. His comments, described by some as throwing King Charles ""under the bus,"" highlight growing rifts within the royal family.Meanwhile, King Charles has struggled to resolve issues surrounding his brother, Prince Andrew, the Duke of York. Early in 2023, Charles attempted to remove Andrew from Royal Lodge, the sprawling estate previously occupied by the Queen Mother. However, Andrew resisted, citing his lease agreement. In response, the King implemented measures to pressure Andrew, including cutting his private security detail and annual allowance, but the Duke of York has reportedly secured independent funding to remain at Royal Lodge, further defying his brother's authority.These tensions underscore the challenges King Charles faces as he attempts to balance his role as monarch while dealing with internal family disputes. The strain is compounded by his health, with reports suggesting that the 76-year-old King is undergoing cancer treatment.The unfolding events reveal a monarchy grappling with conflicting personal interests and strained loyalties. Prince William’s apparent eagerness to carve out his own vision for the monarchy and Prince Andrew's refusal to comply with the King's directives suggest a family divided. For King Charles, these challenges come at a time when unity and stability are essential to preserving the legacy of his reign.","Recent reports suggest that family divisions are straining efforts to maintain unity during his reign.
