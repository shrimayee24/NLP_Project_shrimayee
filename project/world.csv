KOLKATA: CBI questioning of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital's former principal, Sandip Ghosh , which started on Friday afternoon, continued on Saturday, with only a short break, when Ghosh was allowed to go home. This is the longest interrogation session by CBI in any case in Bengal in the recent past.The marathon questioning - 23 hours and counting (till reports last came in) - began a day after CBI, led by joint director V Chandrasekhar, spoke to the parents of the deceased 31-year-old PG trainee doctor at their Sodepur residence.The parents have alleged that their daughter ""was under mental pressure and was reluctant to go to work"", and that the hospital had tried to pass off the rape-murder as suicide.Ghosh was allowed to go home for a short while at 2:30am. On Saturday, he was back at the probe agency's CGO complex office with several files in hand.Before going inside, a visibly tired and shaken Ghosh told media: ""CBI has not arrested me... Please don't spread false information. I have not been made to sit face-to-face with Sanjay (prime accused Sanjay Roy). They have questioned me. The matter is under investigation, and I cannot say anything more at this stage.""As per sources, CBI's special crime unit has bombarded Ghosh with a barrage of questions, including when he learnt of the doctor's death , who informed him and what steps he took on receiving the news. The former principal has claimed he is in no way linked to the death.On Friday, the investigating officers had questioned seven hospital staffers, including nurses, ward boys and security guards. Each of them was asked what exactly they were first told about the doctor's death. Sources said the specific question was asked to get to the bottom of the suicide theory initially floated. The sleuths also quizzed Ghosh's former colleagues - head of the chest department Arunava Dutta Chowdhury and former superintendent of the institute Sanjay Vashisth.The investigators are trying to piece together the sequence of events that led to the doctor's murder, and have recorded statements of more than 32 witnesses so far. On Saturday morning, a close friend of the victim also appeared before the investigators. CBI officers are now corroborating Ghosh's statement with those of the others.On Thursday, victim's parents told CBI they suspected arrested accused Sanjay Roy was not main culprit and was acting at the behest of others.

Who is Sanjay Roy?

Roy joined Kolkata Police’s Disaster Management Group as a civic volunteer in 2019 but used “the right channels” to shift to Kolkata Police’s Welfare Cell.

He reportedly used “connections” to live on the premises of KP’s 4th Battalion. This association helped him get posted at RG Kar Hospital.

What are his position and entitlements?

It has come to light that Roy is a member of the Police Welfare Board’s 14-member central committee, and his 'disapproval' could lead to the transfer of police officers.

The bike Sanjay Roy used to ride had a police sticker on it

What are the allegations against him?

A police inquiry into Sanjay Roy has uncovered multiple allegations against him, including extortion, intimidation, and threats against women.

He was found guilty on at least two occasions—first for assaulting his pregnant wife in 2022, and later for misbehaving with a female doctor a few weeks ago—but he was never censured. He managed to evade capture even after assaulting his pregnant wife.

On Monday, a woman went to Lalbazar to report that Roy had been harassing her by phone for the past three months. He first approached her at RG Kar Hospital under the pretext of buying medicine, obtained her number from the prescription, and has since pressured and threatened her to meet.

Another complaint against Roy concerns police transfers. An officer suspects that his significant “influence” may have played an active role in at least six transfers from the Tala police station and Shyambazar police outpost in recent weeks.

The third claim is that the Kolkata Police informed the family about a possible suicide, but police say the family confirmed the call did not come from them.

Fourthly, there is a rumor that a police officer offered a large sum of money to silence the murdered doctor’s father. However, the police clarified that, following the Nirbhaya case, the state is required to provide financial compensation to the families of victims of murder, acid attacks, rape, and molestation.

NEW DELHI: A Kolkata Police civic volunteer, Sanjay Roy , was taken into custody on Saturday in connection with the brutal rape and murder of a second-year postgraduate trainee doctor at RG Kar Hospital . The arrest came just six hours after a seven-member Special Investigation Team (SIT) was formed to investigate the case. The SIT had brought the 33-year-old suspect in for questioning late Friday night.","Police inquiry into Sanjay Roy has uncovered multiple allegations against him, including extortion, intimidation, and threats against women. CCTV footage captured Roy entering the emergency building at 4am wearing a bluetooth device around his neck. When he left the building 40 minutes later, the earphone was no longer visible. The device was later found to be paired with his cellphone.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112440947,imgsize-36040,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/112440947.jpg"

Punches flew unabated in the Turkish Parliament on Friday as lawmakers discussed the fate of a jailed opposition leader Can Atalay , whose parliamentary immunity was revoked earlier this year.However, Turkey's constitutional court earlier this month struck down Parliament's decision to oust Atalay from his parliament seat.The leaders were meeting following the court's order to determine the future of the leader.Atalay, who is a lawyer, won his seat last year after having campaigned from his prison cell.Ahmet Sik , a fellow member of the leftist Workers' Party of Turkey (TIP), defended Atalay against the attacks on him by ruling party lawmakers.""It's no surprise that you call Atalay a terrorist,"" he said.""All citizens should know that the biggest terrorists of this country are those seated on those benches,"" he added, indicating the ruling majority, according to news agency Reuters.Sik's comment infuriated the ruling party lawmakers, leading to chaos following which the chairman called for a break.That comment drew angry responses from ruling party lawmakers, prompting the chairman to call a break.Scuffles broke out after former footballer Alpay Ozalan, a lawmaker from Erdogan's ruling AKP party, walked to the rostrum and shoved Sik to the ground, said an AFP journalist in parliament.Sik was then punched on the ground several times by ruling party lawmakers.At least two opposition MPs were injured during the fistfight.In January, Atalay was stripped of his parliamentary seat following a heated session, despite efforts by fellow leftist deputies to halt the proceedings.He is one of seven individuals who were sentenced to 18 years in prison in 2022, following a controversial trial that also resulted in the philanthropist Osman Kavala being jailed for life.Despite being imprisoned, the 48-year-old Atalay campaigned and was elected as a member of parliament for the earthquake-stricken Hatay province in the May 2023 general election, representing the leftist TIP party, which holds three seats in the parliament.However, Atalay's election victory led to a legal confrontation between President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's supporters and opposition leaders, pushing Turkey to the brink of a constitutional crisis last year. The decision to remove Atalay from parliament in January came after the Supreme Court of appeals upheld his conviction, paving the way for his parliamentary immunity to be revoked.On August 1, the constitutional court, responsible for reviewing the compliance of judges' rulings with Turkey's basic law, published its ruling on the case, declaring Atalay's removal from parliament as ""null and void"".

Which countries have confirmed mpox virus cases?

WHO warns more mpox to come in Europe after case in Sweden

What is mpox? What are its symptoms?

NEW DELHI: Pakistan has confirmed its first mpox (earlier known as monkeypox ) case of the year after a 34-year-old man who recently returned from Saudi Arabia tested positive for the virus, reported ARY News. The individual, a resident of Mardan, arrived in Pakistan on August 3 and began showing symptoms shortly after reaching Peshawar.The diagnosis was confirmed by Khyber Medical University in Peshawar, and the positive result was verified on August 13, marking the first report of monkeypox in Pakistan for 2024.Health officials have begun contact tracing efforts to identify and monitor individuals who were in close contact with the patient, including fellow passengers on his flight from Saudi Arabia.Earlier in 2023, three passengers were diagnosed with monkeypox at Karachi's Jinnah International Airport. All three were Pakistani citizens aged between 30 and 45. The passengers were admitted to the infectious disease hospital.China will monitor individuals and goods entering the country for mpox over the next six months, according to a statement from its customs administration issued on Friday.Last year, China announced that mpox would be managed as a Category B infectious disease. This designation allows officials to take emergency measures such as restricting gatherings, suspending work and school, or sealing off areas during an outbreak.Category B infectious diseases in China currently include Covid-19, AIDS, and SARS.The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that over 14,000 cases and 524 deaths from mpox have been recorded in Africa this year, surpassing last year's figures. More than 96% of these cases and deaths have occurred in Congo, where a new, potentially more transmissible variant is causing concern among scientists.Sweden's public health agency announced on Thursday that the new mpox variant has been identified in a person who recently traveled to Africa and sought healthcare upon returning to Stockholm.WHO warned further imported cases of the new, more dangerous mpox strain in Europe were likely, after Sweden announced the first such infection outside Africa in an outbreak that has killed hundreds in the DR Congo.The WHO's European regional office in Copenhagen said it was discussing with Sweden how best to manage the newly detected case. ""The confirmation of mpox Clade 1 in Sweden is a clear reflection of the interconnectedness of our world,"" it said in a statement.""There are likely to be further imported cases of Clade 1 in the European region over the coming days and weeks, and it is imperative that we don't stigmatise travellers or countries/regions. Travel restrictions and border closures don't work and should be avoided,"" it added.Mpox, also known as monkeypox, first identified in 1958 in monkeys, has recently spread to over 70 countries. The virus, which is similar to smallpox but milder, has caused outbreaks globally since it was confirmed to spread via sex in 2022.Initially, mpox was mostly seen in central and West Africa among people in close contact with infected animals. However, the 2022 outbreaks marked a significant shift, making it a global concern.Mpox belongs to the same family of viruses as smallpox.

'Ketamine Queen' Jasveen Sangha's luxe life exposed: From celebrity dealer to alleged Matthew Perry's killer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ketamine-queen-jasveen-sanghas-luxe-life-exposed-from-celebrity-dealer-to-alleged-matthews-perry-killer/articleshow/112580364.cms,"Lavish lifestyle and deadly supply

A carefree attitude amidst chaos

Legal battle and denial

In a scandal that has rocked Hollywood, Jasveen Sangha—dubbed the "" Ketamine Queen "" — is accused of supplying the drugs that led to Matthew Perry 's tragic death last October. The extravagant lifestyle of this so-called "" celebrity drug dealer "" is now under the spotlight, revealing a life of opulence funded by a reportedly lucrative underground ketamine operation catering to the elite.As per reports, Sangha’s luxurious existence included foreign escapades to exotic destinations such as Mexico, Spain, Italy, and Dubai, alongside a fleet of high-end vehicles like a Range Rover and a leased 2024 BMW. Her opulent tastes extended to lavish beauty treatments, including Botox and IV drips, as revealed by court documents and sources close to the case. As per the POST, “She was known for her glamorous appearance, flaunting her wealth and connections in the celebrity world,” said a source.The Department of Justice recently uncovered a staggering drug cache in a raid on Sangha's high-end residence. Authorities reported seizing ""80 ketamine vials, thousands of methamphetamine and cocaine pills, Xanax, and other illicit medications."" This discovery came after months of Sangha evading law enforcement, while she continued to indulge in luxury shopping, parties, and travel.Despite the gravity of the allegations, those close to Sangha describe a chilling nonchalance about her situation. “She seemed carefree, like she didn’t have a worry in the world,” a longtime friend was quoted as saying by the POST. “She was always up for parties or dinners, acting as if nothing was amiss, even as the walls were closing in.”In the days leading up to her arrest on August 16, Sangha reportedly visited a hair salon, had her nails done, and attended Hollywood parties. Federal authorities allege that Sangha's brazen lifestyle continued unabated, reflecting a disturbing indifference to the deadly consequences of her alleged actions.Sangha, who has pleaded 'not guilty' to the charges, is facing a complex legal battle. Among those arrested in connection with Perry’s death were his doctors, an assistant, and other associates. The prosecution argues that Sangha’s lavish lifestyle demonstrates her financial ability to flee, adding further tension to the case.A pretrial motion noted, “Based on the defendant’s lifestyle and spending, she has the financial means to flee.” Sangha’s court appearance will be closely watched as the investigation into the fatal ketamine overdose continues to unfold.","Jasveen Sangha is accused of supplying the drugs that led to Matthew Perry's tragic death last October.

"Donald Trump set to rally Pennsylvania voters near Biden’s hometown, counter Harris' surge",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-set-to-rally-pennsylvania-voters-near-bidens-hometown-counter-harris-surge/articleshow/112596026.cms,"Donald Trump is gearing up to rally voters on Saturday in northeastern Pennsylvania, aiming to secure the support of conservative, white working-class voters in a region close to President Joe Biden’s hometown of Scranton. Trump is banking on this area of the pivotal battleground state to boost his chances of reclaiming the White House.Trump dominated his Democratic opponents in the 2016 and 2020 elections in Luzerne County, home to the blue-collar city of Wilkes-Barre.This Rust Belt region, also home to Biden’s native Scranton, provides a glimmer of hope for Trump as he seeks to capitalize on perceived Democratic vulnerabilities following Biden's decision to step aside, paving the way for Vice President Kamala Harris to launch her presidential campaign.Trump is expected to speak at 4 pm EDT on Saturday, just as Democrats prepare for their four-day national convention starting Monday in Chicago. The convention will officially welcome Harris as the Democratic nominee, a move that has energized the party’s base and presented a fresh challenge for Trump.Throughout his campaign, Trump has been critical of Harris, particularly on economic issues. He has linked her to the Biden administration’s struggles with inflation and has likened her recent proposal to combat price gouging to measures seen in communist nations. Trump has warned that a federal ban on grocery price gouging, as proposed by Harris, would lead to food shortages, rationing, and hunger.In Pennsylvania, a state rich in natural gas, Trump has repeatedly cited Harris’ previous opposition to fracking, an oil and gas extraction process. Although her campaign has since softened her stance, asserting that she would not ban fracking, her earlier position during the 2020 presidential primary has left some voters wary.Lieutenant Governor Austin Davis said, “The energy has clearly shifted in a dramatic way toward Vice President Harris,” and accused Trump of merely engaging in “rambling rants” and personal attacks on Harris.Harris plans to embark on a bus tour starting in Pittsburgh on Sunday, with a stop in the small town of Rochester to the north. Meanwhile, Trump has scheduled a visit to a plant in York that manufactures nuclear fuel containers on Monday, with his running mate, JD Vance, expected to campaign in Philadelphia on the same day.Trump’s rally in Wilkes-Barre on Saturday will mark his fifth appearance at the arena in the city, the largest in Luzerne County, where he secured victories in the last two presidential elections. In contrast, Biden won in neighboring Lackawanna County, where he has often highlighted his working-class roots in Scranton.Some of Biden's supporters in the former industrial city of 76,000 residents expressed disappointment when party leaders pressured the president to step aside. Diane Munley, 63, said she called dozens of members of Congress to advocate for Biden. Although she eventually came to terms with his decision, she is now fully supportive of Harris.“I can’t deny the enthusiasm that’s been going on with this ticket right now. I am so into it,” Munley said. “It just wasn’t happening with Joe, and I couldn’t see it at the time because I was so connected to him.”Munley added that she doesn’t know a Democrat or independent in her circle who isn’t fully committed to Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. “We are all-in on Kamala Harris,” Munley said. “All in 110%.”However, not everyone shares Munley’s enthusiasm. Robert A. Bridy, 64, a laborer from Shamokin, Pennsylvania, traveled to Wilkes-Barre to support Trump. He acknowledged that the race feels tight in Pennsylvania and noted that his union and a close friend have tried to convince him to vote for Harris and other Democrats, but he remains steadfast in his support for Trump.“It’s close. You can’t change Democrats’ minds no matter what. They’ve got a one-track mind, and that’s it,” Bridy said.He described Trump as a “working-class guy like us,” despite Trump being a billionaire who made his fortune in real estate. “He’s a fighter,” Bridy said. “I’d like to see the closed borders. He doesn’t mess around. He goes at it right away and takes care of business the way it should be.”","Trump dominated his Democratic opponents in the 2016 and 2020 elections in Luzerne County, home to the blue-collar city of Wilkes-Barre.

Their love story continued with marriage and two daughters, Allyson and Kaylee.The Comperatore family was at the rally to see Trump in person for the first time. When the shooting started, Corey warned his family to get down and shielded them. ""I was the one that my dad threw down. As he was throwing me down, that was when he was shot and he ended up falling onto me,"" Allyson recounted. Kaylee, still grappling with the trauma, said, ""I started screaming, but in my head, I kept saying, 'Wake up,' like this is a dream.""In a poignant tribute, Corey's firefighter gear was displayed at the Republican National Convention. Helen shared that Corey had joked about being called up on stage, and his display at the convention was seen as a fulfillment of that wish.The Comperatore family has received an outpouring of support, including prayer shawls, a cross, wind chimes, and numerous cards. A GoFundMe campaign has raised millions for the family, but Helen knows it cannot bring Corey back. ""I talk to him anyway, and the only thing that ever comes out of my mouth is, 'I'm sorry that this happened to you,'"" she said.Helen Comperatore has hired an attorney to seek justice and answers about the shooting.

Kaylee expressed her frustration, saying, ""I really think my dad's blood is on their hands, and I hope they wake up every day thinking about what they took from our family.""Two other individuals were also injured in the shooting. David Dutch, 57, from New Kensington, and James Copenhaver, 74, from Moon Township, are both recovering at home.The Comperatore family plans to use the funds raised to start a foundation in Corey’s honor.

Dangerously liberal ."" The video features a series of clips highlighting controversial statements and positions taken by Kamala Harris .The video opens with a tagline suggesting a glimpse into what Harris would do as President. The initial clip shows Harris saying, ""As President of the US, I am prepared to get rid of filibusters,"" followed by another segment where she says, ""There is no question that I am banning fracking.""Harris also expresses support for ""gun confiscation"" in the video.When questioned by a reporter about the impact on private insurance, Harris responds, ""Let’s eliminate all of that,"" which Trump’s video tagged as ""socialist health care.""Further into the video, another reporter asks Harris about her support for changing dietary guidelines. Harris replies affirmatively, with the video labeling it as ""Harris will reduce meat consumption.""The video continues with clips of Harris discussing defunding the police and drawing comparisons between Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Ku Klux Klan (KKK).In a November 2018 confirmation hearing, then-Senator Harris questioned Ronald Vitiello, Trump’s nominee to lead ICE, about the perceived parallels between ICE and the KKK. Harris highlighted a 2015 tweet from Vitiello in which he compared the Democratic Party to a ""neo-Klanist"" entity. Vitiello later apologised for his remarks.The video also includes Harris’s support for the “defund the police” movement during a June 2020 radio interview. Harris said that the movement ""rightly"" critiqued the allocation of funds to police departments over community services such as education, housing, and healthcare. She emphasised the need to reassess budgets to reflect appropriate priorities, stating that increased policing did not necessarily equate to increased public safety.Donald Trump shared another video of Kamala in his X post saying, ""If you think things are expensive now, they will get 100 times WORSE if Kamala gets four years as President.

"Once a democrat voting for Hillary, now ... ': What J D Vance said about wife Usha",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/once-a-democrat-voting-for-hillary-now-what-j-d-vance-said-about-wife-usha/articleshow/112595010.cms,"Usha Vance , wife of Ohio Senator JD Vance, has undergone a significant political transformation , moving from a former Democrat who supported Hillary Clinton to fully embracing the MAGA agenda.In January 2023, shortly after JD Vance was sworn in by Vice President Kamala Harris, he publicly acknowledged his wife’s crucial role in his political career. “I am going to try to not get too emotional here, but just say to get to represent the people of Ohio in the United States Senate is a dream come true for me, and I wouldn’t be here without Usha.So thank you, honey, from the bottom of my heart,” JD said during the ceremony.Usha’s shift in political alignment has attracted attention given her previous Democratic leanings. Around 2016, JD Vance mentioned to a friend that Usha planned to vote for Hillary Clinton. Usha, who was previously registered as a Democrat, comes from a family with Democratic ties. According to New York times her parents remain registered as Democrats, and her mother, Lakshmi Chilukuri, signed a letter urging then-President Trump to uphold the Paris Climate Accords.Usha has had a distinguished career, with extensive time spent at elite institutions including Yale and Cambridge, and working at the progressive law firm Munger, Tolles & Olson. Despite her background, she has publicly supported her husband’s MAGA agenda.The Vance’s partnership began at Yale Law School , where Usha, daughter of Indian immigrant academics, and JD, a Marine veteran from a working-class background, met. Their relationship quickly developed, with Usha playing a supportive role in JD’s career.In recent months, Usha’s shift to supporting the MAGA platform has been evident. Jai Chabria, an early political advisor to JD, stated, “There’s no daylight there,” highlighting her alignment with her husband’s current political position.Usha’s role has been significant behind the scenes. Following the success of JD’s book Hillbilly Elegy, Usha managed his schedule and communications while maintaining her career. After JD’s vice-presidential nomination, Usha resigned from her position at Munger, Tolles & Olson.Usha also contributed to JD’s RNC speech, which focused on family and working-class issues, reflecting themes from his book. Although she avoids public campaigning, her support for JD remains steadfast.JD’s campaign has faced challenges, including unfavorable ratings and a reception of his speeches that has not met expectations. Usha addressed these issues during a Fox & Friends appearance, noting, “That can be hard. Sometimes I don’t see it all and sometimes I do see it and I look at it and think well this is not the JD I know.”Usha’s experience with political controversies, including her clerkship with Brett Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court confirmation hearings, has informed her approach to navigating political challenges. “I look back at it and I think about Mrs. Kavanaugh and the way that she carried herself and it showed a lot of strength and it’s a model for the way to proceed,” Usha said.","Usha Vance, wife of Ohio Senator JD Vance, has undergone a significant political transformation.

Artist who designed Obama poster releases similar one for Kamala,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-presidential-elections-hope-and-progress-in-america-as-donald-trump-totters/articleshow/112594382.cms,"WASHINGTON: The artist who designed the iconic 'hope' poster featuring Barack Obama in 2008 has released a similar Kamala Harris poster with a one-word exhortation, ' progress ', adding another dimension to a presidential election in which photos, images, and memes are playing a key role.Shepard Fairey 's stylized stencil portrait shows a radiant Kamala Harris in black, white, blue, and red colors, similar to the solid red, beige and blue colors in Obama's 'hope' poster that galvanised the Democratic campaign in 2008.The portrait, which one art critic called ""the most efficacious American political illustration since 'Uncle Sam Wants You' was eventually acquired by the Smithsonian Institution's National Portrait Gallery.Fairey later expressed disappointment with Obama in 2015 towards the end of his presidency and did not make any portrait of Hillary Clinton in 2016 (saying he did not find her inspiring) or of Joe Biden in 2020. But he seems taken in by the Harris-Walz ticket.In an instagram post following the release of the Kamala portrait, he made no secret of his political orientation, saying, “I believe VP Kamala Harris and her VP pick Tim Walz are... our best chance to push back on encroaching fascism and threats to democracy, and our best chance for creating the world we all desire and deserve.”Fairey also explained that inspiration for the “forward” message came from a line Harris has been using at some of her rallies: “We are not going back.” He said the graphic was based on a photo taken by White House photographer Lawrence Jackson.The Kamala portrait comes in an election campaign where images and memes are playing a significant role. Trump himself highlighted a Time magazine cover of Kamala Harris, expressing irritation and pique that she looked so good in the pencil drawing, and clumsily comparing her to his wife Melania.Strangely, the iconic photo of Trump's bloodied ear and raised fist after surviving an assassination attempt last month is receding rather quickly from public memory, like the episode itself. Whether this is because public memory is even shorter in the electronic age that throws up millions of images every day or because of Trump's own shambolic campaign is hard to say, but the Kamala Harris campaign is clearly doing a better job of image-building currently.In fact, language mavens, body language experts, and style gurus are waxing eloquent about the positive and youthful vibes coming from Kamala Harris, who is nearing 60 (on October 20), compared to Donald Trump, who they say comes across as a surly old man.","Shepard Fairey's stencil portrait shows a radiant Kamala Harris in black, white, blue, and red colors, similar to the solid red, beige and blue colors in Obama's 'hope' poster that galvanised the Democratic campaign in 2008.

Pakistani minister says more arrests expected in retired ISI chief's court-martial case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistani-minister-says-more-arrests-expected-in-retired-isi-chiefs-court-martial-case/articleshow/112564172.cms,"LAHORE: More arrests will be made in connection with the court martial of former ISI chief General (Retd) Faiz Hameed in a housing scam, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said on Friday, a day after three more retired military officers were arrested in the case. Hameed, who served as director general of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) from 2019 to 2021, was arrested following action in the complaint of a private property developer over alleged misuse of official authority.""Investigations are underway in the Faiz case. More arrests are likely in the army and elsewhere,"" Dawn News quoted the minister as saying here.""It seems the ambit will not just remain limited to the military but whoever is involved and whoever has compromised the country's security… all those will come in its grasp,"" Tarar said.The minister's remarks came hours after the ISPR, the military's public affairs division, in a statement on Thursday said: ""In connection with the Field General Court Martial (FGCM) proceedings of Lt Gen (Retd) Faiz Hameed, three retired officers are also in military custody for their actions prejudicial to military discipline.""The ISPR said more retired officers and their associates were being probed for allegedly inciting instability in collaboration with and on behalf of a political entity with vested interests.The ISPR did not release the names or ranks of the officers arrested and did not indicate when the arrests had been made, but media reports claimed they were identified as Brigadier (Retd) Ghaffar, a former deputy director general for projects at ISI; Brig (Retd) Naeem Fakhar, a former officer commanding; and Colonel (Retd) Asim.Welcoming the fresh arrests in connection with the court martial proceedings against Gen Faiz for his alleged involvement in the case, Tarar said the institution of the army had prioritised self-accountability.""We think this act of self-accountability is positive and that it is a step that needs to be lauded, moving towards accountability and discord in the country being stopped.""Tarar said when a no-confidence motion was tabled against ex-prime minister Imran Khan, Gen Faiz was in contact with him. ""[Even] after going to jail Imran Khan remained in touch with Gen Faiz,"" he alleged.Taking note of the ISPR statement, Tarar regretted that discord and instability were being spread. Attempts were being made to impose an uncertain situation in the country and there were security attacks.""I think it is a very good and timely decision of the military to arrest Gen Hameed and the subsequent three officers,"" he said, adding that jailed former premier Khan was trying to dissociate himself from Gen Faiz Hameed but ""won't be able to save his neck"".The ISPR announcement follows speculation that numerous retired officers had been detained about Gen Hameed's trial for his post-retirement actions that violated the Army Act and on the complaint of the owner of a housing society in Islamabad, which had been referred to the Defence Ministry by the Supreme Court.Hameed was arrested on August 8 after being summoned to Rawalpindi by a senior army officer, with his detention only being publicly confirmed on the following Monday.His trial is being described as one of the most high-profile court martials in the history of the Pakistan Army.The unprecedented arrest of the top-ranking officer, who led the premier intelligence agency, broke the myth in the country that such powerful officers were beyond the reach of law.Lt Gen (retd.) Hameed was considered extremely powerful when he headed the spy agency from 2019 to 2021.He was appointed to the coveted post when then ISI chief and current Army chief Lt Gen Asim Munir was prematurely removed from the post. It was reported then that Khan was not happy with Munir.Later, the army decided to replace Hameed, a move vehemently opposed by Khan. It is believed that it was the beginning of the souring of his ties with the powerful military.Hameed took premature retirement in November 2022, four months before his retirement date after the current army chief took over.

Pakistan govt accuses ISI ex-chief of political interference,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-govt-accuses-isi-ex-chief-of-political-interference/articleshow/112504585.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif has said former Inter-Services Intelligence chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd) was involved in political events after retirement. Asif’s statement came hours after the military announced Hameed’s arrest, saying field court martial proceedings had been initiated against him.Speaking to a private news channel, Asif accused the retired general of violating the Army Act by interfering in politics in Dec 2022.The act bars officials from engaging in political activity for two years after retirement. “Gen Faiz was definitely involved in the events that took place in the political scene post his retirement,” the minister said.When asked about Hameed’s involvement in the May 9, 2023 riots by alleged supporters of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan, the minister said, “He might have provided a little bit of logistics and provided his experience of conspiracies, and may have defined targets for protesters to inflict maximum damage,” adding, “You can say he might have had the role of a strategic adviser in the May 9 attacks.”Following Imran’s brief arrest in a graft case last year, his supporters had attacked and damaged government and military assets. Hundreds of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) workers and politicians were arrested after the riots. Some still remain behind bars. The military has also initiated army court trials against more than 100 people accused of involvement in the May 9, 2023 violence.Gen Hameed’s arrest has sparked widespread speculation, with many linking the move to his close ties with Imran who has demanded the formation of a judicial commission to probe the ex-spymaster’s arrest to check if it was linked to the May 9 events.Many politicians accused Gen Hameed of using harsh methods and coercive techniques while serving as ISI chief to please his military and political superiors and achieve his own personal goals. Former PM Nawaz Sharif has repeatedly claimed that Hameed, a number of Supreme Court judges, and former army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa were responsible for his ouster in 2017. Hameed was then leading an ISI wing concerned with domestic issues.Gen Hameed had replaced General Asim Munir, the current army chief, as ISI director-general in 2019. Gen Munir was unceremoniously fired by Imran when the latter was PM. The rivalry between these three individuals is partly to blame for Pakistan’s current political turmoil.As the spy agency’s head Gen Hameed had used his authority to threaten and detain Imran’s political rivals, including former PMs, on what they claimed were false accusations. He was seen by opposition politicians as a spy chief who had managed PTI’s past govt activities from behind the scenes.Both Hameed and Imran had approved the policy of repatriating Pakistani Taliban militants from Afghanistan back to Pakistan, which critics claim has led to the return of militancy to Pakistan. Hameed has also been perceived as a supporter of the Afghan Taliban, having backed their takeover of Kabul following the American withdrawal in Aug 2021.In Oct 2021, Gen Bajwa had removed Hameed as spy chief, prompting Khan to oppose the move before eventually agreeing. As a PM, Imran had publicly acknowledged that he wanted to retain Hameed as ISI chief because of the situation in Afghanistan.","Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif has said former Inter-Services Intelligence chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd) was involved in political events after retirement.
