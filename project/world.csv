"Handling automatic rifles, self-defence: Army trains Village Defence Guards in J&K - watch",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/handling-automatic-rifles-self-defence-army-trains-village-defence-guards-in-jk-watch/articleshow/126264068.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Army has launched a training programme for the Village Defence Guards (VDG) in Jammu and Kashmir amid the ongoing counter-terrorism operation in the higher reaches of Chenab valley.According to the Army, around 15 Village Defence Guards, including women volunteers, are undergoing intensive training in handling automatic rifles, minor tactics, self-defence, bunker construction and repelling enemy attacks, they said.Officials told news agency PTI that the raining is being conducted at Shingini panchayat of Balassa, around 90 km from the Doda district headquarters. It aims to equip volunteers with the necessary skills to protect their villages and act as a first line of defence, especially in vulnerable areas.The move complements the ongoing operation by the Army, police and paramilitary forces in the higher reaches to track down and neutralise the terrorists who had managed to infiltrate into Chenab valley, especially Doda and Kishtwar districts, a couple of years back, officials added.The VDGs welcomed the training and the recent upgradation of their weaponry. They expressed gratitude to Union Home Minister Amit Shah for providing self-loading rifles (SLRs), replacing the older .303 rifles, which they said, has significantly boosted their confidence.""This is a major programme bringing together members from 17 Village Defence Groups. We are being trained in weapon handling, bunker construction and self-defence. Receiving such training at our doorstep is highly appreciable,"" Surinder Singh, a VDG member from Shingani, said.He requested the government to provide more automatic weapons to the members, recalling the frequent terror attacks in the region during the early 1990s.Another VDG member, Rajesh Kumar Thakur from Gauala village, said the training by the Army and Jammu and Kashmir Police has instilled a sense of confidence.""Earlier, we only had .303 rifles. After receiving automatic weapons, our confidence has increased, and we now feel capable of defending our villages,"" he said.This comes as he Army has intensified its counter-terrorism operations across the Kishtwar and Doda districts amid the ongoing Chillai Kalan — the 40-day bone-chilling winter period — in Jammu and Kashmir.According to sources, various intelligence agencies asses that there are approximately 30 to 35 Pakistani terrorists currently in the Jammu region.Inputs gathered over the past few months suggest that these groups, finding themselves cornered by successful counter-terror operations, have shifted deeper into higher and middle mountain reaches of the region — areas now devoid of habitation. These terrorists are believed to be seeking temporary winter hideouts to evade detection and avoid direct confrontation with security troops, they added.Meanwhile, the Army and security forces have also adopted a proactive winter posture, establishing temporary bases and surveillance posts deep within snow-covered areas to maintain continuous pressure on potential terrorist hideouts.","Around 15 Village Defence Guards, including women volunteers, are undergoing intensive training in handling automatic rifles, minor tactics, self-defence, bunker construction and repelling enemy attacks.

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Shama Mohamed has raised concerns over the law and order situation following the death of Angel Chakma, a student from Tripura in Dehradun.Referring to a video circulating online, she alleged rising threats against minorities and questioned the Prime Minister's silence, urging the Supreme Court to take suo motu cognisance of the matter.Speaking to ANI, Mohamed said, ""Such an incident can happen with anyone.

NEW DELHI: Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi has claimed that Beijing mediated several global conflicts, including the standoff between India and Pakistan in May following the Pahalgam terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir.Speaking at the Symposium on the International Situation and China’s Foreign Relations on Tuesday, Wang said Beijing had taken an “objective and just stance” to build peace and focused on addressing “both symptoms and root causes”.“This year, local wars and cross-border conflicts flared up more often than at any time since the end of WWII. Geopolitical turbulence continued to spread,” Wang said at the symposium in Beijing.“To build peace that lasts, we have taken an objective and just stance, and focused on addressing both symptoms and root causes. Following this Chinese approach to settling hotspot issues, we mediated in northern Myanmar, the Iranian nuclear issue, the tensions between Pakistan and India, the issues between Palestine and Israel, and the recent conflict between Cambodia and Thailand,” he said.The statement comes despite Beijing’s role during the May 7–10 Operation Sindoor conflict between India and Pakistan coming under serious scrutiny and criticism, particularly over alleged military assistance provided by China to Islamabad.After the conflict flared up, Deputy Chief of Army Staff Lt General Rahul R Singh had said Beijing used the confrontation as a “live lab”, while declining to directly elaborate on the charge.Gen Singh said China’s strategy during Operation Sindoor was based on its ancient military doctrine of the “36 stratagems”, accusing Beijing of seeking to hurt India by “killing with a borrowed knife” — a reference to alleged Chinese support to Pakistan.Meanwhile, the Indian Army on Tuesday hailed Operation Sindoor, underlining ten major milestones achieved by the force in 2025.“Nine terrorist camps across the border were destroyed. The Indian Army neutralised seven camps, while the remaining two were destroyed by the Indian Air Force. Pakistan attempted to target military and civilian assets using drones, but Indian Army air defence units successfully neutralised all threats, preventing damage and casualties. More than a dozen terror launch pads along the Line of Control were destroyed using Indian Army ground-based weapons,” the Army said.“The director general of military operations of the Indian Army was approached by his Pakistani counterpart with a request for a ceasefire. An understanding was reached to stop firing and military action,” it added.India and Pakistan were locked in a brief but intense military confrontation in May, triggered by a terror attack in the Pahalgam valley of Jammu and Kashmir on April 22, which claimed 26 innocent lives.India responded with Operation Sindoor, targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.India has consistently dismissed claims of any third-party mediation, maintaining that the four-day confrontation was resolved through direct military-to-military communication.New Delhi has maintained that after sustaining heavy damage, Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) called his Indian counterpart, and both sides agreed to stop all firing and military action on land, air and sea with effect from May 10.","Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi claims Beijing mediated several global conflicts, including the standoff between India and Pakistan in May.

'Called Minor Matter, Refused FIR': Tripura Student Angel Chakma's Father Blasts Uttarakhand Police

DEHRADUN: The family of Anjel Chakma, the young Tripura native killed in Dehradun earlier this month, pushed back sharply against the city police chief's public dismissal of racial slurs as a motive behind the murder - a claim central to the family's version of events and backed, they say, by the firsthand account of Anjel's brother, Michael, who witnessed the attack.Momen Chakma, Anjel's uncle and among the first relatives to arrive in the city after the assault, said the police were choosing to ignore the words of the only eyewitness. ""Michael is not just a family member, he's the complainant in the case. He was there when it happened. The incident lasted minutes - how do you expect anyone to stop and film something like that?"" he told TOI Tuesday. ""Instead of listening to the person who saw it unfold, they are issuing public statements without even completing the investigation. ""Faced with mounting questions, Dehradun SSP Ajai Singh clarified Tuesday that Michael's complaint only mentioned ""casteist slurs"". He said, ""The family stayed in Dehradun until Dec 27 but did not mention racial slurs to the police...If they want to share additional information, we are open to including it in the probe.""If the family of Tripura native Anjel Chakma is saying this (racial slurs motive behind the murder) now, we are not aware of it.However, the case is still under investigation,"" Dehradun SSP Ajai Singh said. Police were gathering all possible evidence to build a strong case before filing the chargesheet, he added. Dehradun police, citing ethnic background of some of the accused, had said they found no indication of racial provocation in the case. The family, still grieving, called this ""premature and deeply dismissive"".Anjel, 24, and his younger brother Michael, were in Dehradun when they were allegedly attacked by a group of six men after objecting to their disruptive behaviour. According to Michael and other family members, the attackers shouted racial slurs - words like ""chinki"", ""Chinese"", and ""momo"" - before turning violent. Michael sustained injuries, and Anjel later died of his wounds. ""It's not just about one word or one insult,"" Momen said. ""It's about whether our voices are even considered valid when we speak.""SSP Singh had on Monday pointed out that two of the six accused were from Manipur and Nepal, which, he said, made a racial motive unlikely. That reasoning has since triggered public criticism, particularly from members of North-East civil society and activists familiar with the region's complex ethnic and linguistic diversity.","Anjel Chakma, 24, and his younger brother Michael, were in Dehradun when they were allegedly attacked by a group of six men after objecting to their disruptive behaviour.

Chicken’s Neck Threat Sparks Sharp Reply As Nagaland Minister Warns Bangladesh Radicals Boldly

GUWAHATI: Assam police busted a module of Imam Mahmuder Kafila (IMK) with the arrest of 11 alleged operatives of the Bangladesh-based Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) offshoot formed in 2018. Investigators said IMK expanded its base in the state after Bangladesh's Aug 2024 regime change that led to the exit of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.Of the 11 people held by Assam police's Special Task Force (STF), 10 were picked up from Assam and one from Tripura in operations since late Monday night. CM Himanta Biswa Sarma acknowledged the threat from such modules. ""Fundamentalists are definitely active in Assam. The issue will remain for long as Bangladesh is Assam's neighbouring country,"" Sarma said.STF chief and Guwahati police commissioner Partha Sarathi Mahanta said IMK used encrypted social media groups to radicalise and recruit youths in Assam and nearby states, spread propaganda, raise funds through hawala and UPI channels, and facilitate cross-border travel for training.""Probe revealed that following the regime change in Bangladesh in Aug 2024, top leaders of JMB, Ansarullah Bangla Team (ABT) and al-Qaida in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) issued directions to IMK leadership to activate and expand its Indian modules.Bangladeshi nationals Umar and Khalid were assigned to coordinate Assam-based activities. The head of the Assam cell is one Nasim Uddin alias Tamim of Barpeta Road in Barpeta district in Assam,"" Mahanta said.Nasim Uddin was among those 11 arrested. Multiple charges under BNS, 2023 and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967 were slapped on the suspects.Mahanta said IMK, banned in India, was formed by Jewel Mahmud alias Imam Mahmud Habibullah alias Sohail, described as a former JMB member who claims to be the amir (leader) of IMK and propagates the ideology of ""Ghazwatul Hind (Battle against India)"".Mahanta said IMK propagated an ideology aligned with proscribed transnational jihadi organisations and operated through secure social media platforms. ""One such social media group is 'Purva Akash', which functions as a principal communication and recruitment platform. People from Assam, Bengal and Tripura were being radicalised, recruited, financially mobilised. IMK disseminates extremist propaganda advocating violent jihad and the armed conquest of India. ""Investigators found that some Assam-based IMK operatives had travelled to Bangladesh earlier this year on valid passports and visas for training and coordination, Mahanta further said.",Assam police arrest 11 alleged operatives of the Bangladesh-based Jamaat-ul- Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) offshoot formed in 2018.

From First Woman PM To Fierce Rivalry: Khaleda Zia’s Three Terms That Redefined Bangladesh Politics

Leaders worldwide offers condolences after the death of former PM





Former Bangladesh prime minister and Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chairperson Khaleda Zia died early Tuesday at the age of 80, party officials confirmed. She had been undergoing treatment at Evercare Hospital in Dhaka. According to her party, Zia died around 6.00 am, shortly after Fajr prayers, after remaining in critical condition for months.A dominant figure in Bangladesh’s politics for decades, Khaleda Zia was the country’s first woman prime minister and the long-time political rival of Sheikh Hasina. She had been suffering from multiple serious health complications, including heart, lung, liver and kidney ailments, diabetes and pneumonia. Zia had been under intensive medical care since November.Her death comes just days after her elder son and BNP’s acting chairperson Tarique Rahman returned to Bangladesh from London, ending 17 years of self-imposed exile as the country moves toward crucial national elections.Khaleda Zia was born in 1945 in Jalpaiguri and grew up in Dinajpur. She married Ziaur Rahman in 1960, who later became Bangladesh’s president after seizing power as a military chief in 1977.Following his assassination in a military coup in 1981, Khaleda, who had never been involved in politics, entered public life and took charge of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) in 1984.She emerged as a key leader in the mass movement against military ruler HM Ershad, earning a reputation as an uncompromising figure in the struggle to restore democracy. In 1991, she led the BNP to victory and became Bangladesh’s first elected woman prime minister, introducing the parliamentary system of government and later playing a role in establishing the caretaker government system for elections.Khaleda Zia served as prime minister two times from 1991 to 1996 and again from 2001 to 2006. Her political career was defined by a fierce rivalry with Sheikh Hasina, a contestant who shaped Bangladesh’s politics for more than three decades.In later years, Zia faced multiple corruption cases, which her party described as politically motivated. She was jailed in 2018 and remained largely confined due to illness after being granted temporary release in 2020. In January 2025, the Supreme Court acquitted her in the final corruption case against her, effectively clearing her name.Following Hasina’s ouster in a mass uprising in 2024, an interim government led by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus allowed Zia to travel abroad for advanced treatment. She returned from London in May but remained seriously ill and withdrew from active politics, though she continued as BNP chairperson until her death.Khaleda Zia is survived by her elder son Tarique Rahman, while her younger son, Arafat Rahman Koko died in 2015. Despite years of illness and imprisonment, she remains one of the most influential and polarising figures in Bangladesh’s political history.Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered his 'sincere condolences' after the death of Khaleda Zia and recalled his meeting with former PM in Dhaka in 2015.In a post on X, he wrote: ""Deeply saddened to learn about the passing away of former Prime Minister and BNP Chairperson Begum Khaleda Zia in Dhaka. Our sincerest condolences to her family and all the people of Bangladesh. May the Almighty grant her family the fortitude to bear this tragic loss. """"As the first woman Prime Minister of Bangladesh, her important contributions towards the development of Bangladesh, as well as India-Bangladesh relations, will always be remembered. I recall my warm meeting with her in Dhaka in 2015. We hope that her vision and legacy will continue to guide our partnership. May her soul rest in peace,"" PM Modi further wrote.Muhammad Yunus also expressed his profound grief over the death of former BNP chief and described her as a ""great guardian"" of the nation and a towering figure in Bangladesh's democratic history.""Begum Khaleda Zia was not merely the leader of a political party; she represented an important chapter in the history of Bangladesh,"" Yunus wrote in his message. The BNP has declared seven days of official mourning following her death.","Former Bangladesh PM Khaleda Zia has died at the age of 80. Zia was the country's first woman prime minister and long-time political rival of Sheikh Hasina. She had been suffering from multiple serious health complications, including heart, lung, liver and kidney ailments, diabetes and pneumonia.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126242736,imgsize-347459,width-400,resizemode-4/khaleda-zia.jpg"
Message to Congress leadership or attacking coterie? Why Digvijaya Singh’s 'power of organisation' post is intriguing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/message-to-congress-leadership-or-attacking-coterie-why-digvijaya-singhs-power-of-organisation-post-is-intriguing/articleshow/126253556.cms,"Shashi Tharoor Responds To Digvijaya Singh, Says Congress Needs Discipline, Not Lessons From RSS

NEW DELHI: Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh is no stranger to controversies. The former Madhya Pradesh chief minister, who is known to speak out his mind, has triggered several political storms with his remarks. The veteran Congress leader, who has been one of the strongest critics of the BJP and the RSS , has often been accused of insulting the Hindu community to appease the minorities. In fact, such has been some of his remarks in the past that even the Congress was forced to distance itself from them. It is in this context that his latest social media post citing RSS and BJP to highlight the “power of organisation” seems intriguing.The Congress Rajya Sabha member on Saturday shared a 1996 photo of Prime Minister Narendra Modi with L K Advani and praised the BJP and the RSS for promoting ground workers – alluding to PM Modi – to posts like chief minister and Prime Minister. ""I found this picture on the Quora site. It is very impactful. In the way the grassroots swayamsevaks (workers) of RSS and the workers of Jan Sangh @BJP4India sit on the floor at the feet of leaders and become the Chief Minister of the state and the Prime Minister of the country. This is the power of the organization. Jai Siya Ram,"" Singh said on X.As expected, the post created a flutter. The fact that it coincided with the Congress Working Committee meeting and was tagged not just to the party's top leadership but also to Prime Minister Modi added to the intrigue.Also, the use of ""Jai Siya Ram"" at the end seemed strange for a leader, who was once in the centre of a storm for using “Osamaji” for Osama bin Laden. Under all round fire then, Digvijaya had clarified that it was a slip of tongue.So, what was the objective of Digvijaya’s post? Was he actually trying to please the BJP and the RSS? Or was he dropping hints about his future plans and sending a message to the top leadership? Or was he targeting leaders within the Congress who are close to the top leadership?While nothing is impossible in politics, it is difficult to believe that Digvijaya would have had a sudden change of heart vis-a-vis the RSS and BJP and would try to please them.So, was the Congress veteran sending across a message to the top leadership? Well, Digvijaya’s Rajya Sabha term ends in July 2026 and the big question is will the Congress nominate him again? If not, how would he react? After all, we have seen another party veteran Ghulam Nabi Azad turn from a loyalist to a rebel and quit the party in 2021 after he was denied a Rajya Sabha ticket. Will Digvijaya follow suit if ignored? Well, we do not know for now.So, that brings us to the third possible reason for Digvijaya’s post. Was the senior Congress leader targeting the top office-bearers in his party responsible for running the organisation and who are very close to the leadership? The fact that many leaders came out in his support on the need to strengthen the organization gives some credence to this possibility.Most Congress leaders, as expected, unleashed a broadside against Digvijaya’s post and rejected the idea of learning anything from the RSS. Congress leader Pawan Khera said, ""There's nothing to learn from the RSS. What can an organisation known for Godse teach an organisation founded by Gandhi?""Congress MP Manickam Tagore asserted that the Congress had nothing to learn from what he described as a hate-driven organisation. “The RSS is an organisation of hatred. It spreads hatred, breeds hatred and carries out propaganda based on hate. There is nothing to learn from the RSS,” he said.However, many others defended Digvijaya and argued that the focus should not be on the example he had cited but on his message for strength and unity in an organization. They cited his commitment to the Congress and also his strong anti-RSS stand in the past.""Look, it is important to pay attention to whose words are being used, what they mean, and in what context they are spoken. No one can even remotely think that whatever Digvijaya Singh says would not be in the interest of the Congress party or that he would speak in a way that goes against the party's ideology. He is a pillar of the Congress party, and if he has used any particular language, it is necessary to understand what his context was and what his target was what he was trying to do,"" Salman Khurshid told ANI.Congress leader TS Singh Deo defended Digvijaya Singh's remarks and said: ""Digvijaya Singh is much senior to me; I cannot comment on his statement. He will be able to explain it better, but as far as strengthening the organisation is concerned, it is a continuous process...In any organisation, whether it is the BJP, RSS, or any other, everyone's work is reviewed. The BJP certainly reviews the Congress and other parties. .. So, Digvijaya Singh's intention was not to imitate anyone, but he spoke about what we can do to strengthen the organisation.""Congress MP Imran Masood said Digvijaya Singh has consistently opposed the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). ""Digvijay Singh is a staunch opponent of the RSS. That's all I know; there's no need to create so much controversy over this,"" he said. Congress leader Rajeev Shukla also defended the former MP CM and said that the matter was being ""unnecessarily amplified"".Party leader Udit Raj openly backed Digvijaya’s message and admitted that the grand old party was grappling with serious organisational weaknesses and widespread factionalism. ""There is definitely organisational weakness. Is there any doubt about that? For 10 years, we couldn't even appoint district presidents. Whenever someone was appointed, another group would block it. Factionalism is rampant,"" Udit Raj told news agency IANS. ""Discussion is part of Congress tradition; we don't run a dictatorship like the BJP. It is in our tradition to introspect. If there were no organisational weaknesses, would we keep losing elections repeatedly? The positive thing is that we are working to overcome our shortcomings. There is nothing wrong with it,"" he added.Candid confession that to some extent justifies Digvijaya’s strong post.However, with his remarks putting the Congress on the backfoot, Digvijaya first issued clarification and then sent out a unity message slamming the BJP. ""I am a supporter of the organisation, but an opponent of the RSS and Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi. I have only praised the organisational strength of the RSS. I have always opposed the policies of the BJP and the RSS,"" he said as his post raised a storm. Later, he targeted the BJP and said ""There is no difference in ideology. We (Congress) are all united, and this Nehru-Gandhi family is a family in which two people have been martyred. I strongly condemn the BJP's attempts to sow discord within this family."" "" Rahul Gandhi has started this initiative (strengthening the organisation) from the district level and below. The process for that is underway. It will be completed soon,"" the Rajya Sabha member added.While this clarification helps the Congress counter the BJP attacks, it does little to solve the mystery behind his cryptic message: Was Digvijaya dropping hints about his future plans or was he targeting Congress leadership and the coterie in the party?",Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh is no stranger to controversies. His latest social media post citing RSS and BJP to highlight the “power of organisation” seems intriguing. Was he actually trying to please the BJP and the RSS? Or was he dropping hints about his future plans?,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126255265,imgsize-771097,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Security Forces Launch Cordon-And-Search Operations In Kishtwar, Doda and Poonch

JAMMU: Security forces Tuesday launched cordon-and-search operations in the upper reaches of Kishtwar, Doda and Poonch districts in J&K after reported sightings of terror suspects. Official sources said two groups of Jaish-e-Mohammad terrorists, each consisting of two to three ultras, were believed to be moving in the region, which has witnessed encounters in the past.“Acting on inputs about the presence of suspected terrorists in Doda-Kishtwar forests, security forces launched an anti-terror operation in Keshwan-Chatroo valley. Drones were roped in for aerial surveillance,” an official source said.Official sources said Army personnel carried out search operations at Khanetar Top along the Line of Control in Poonch and adjoining areas on Tuesday after suspicious movements were reported. The troops were equipped with aerial surveillance support and sniffer dogs.On Nov 5, a fierce gun battle broke out between troops and terrorists in Kalaban forests, Chatroo (Kishtwar). The district has seen as many as six encounters in the past seven months, even as troops continued their hunt for Pakistan-based ultras hiding in Chatroo and adjoining hilly areas. On Dec 15, an SOG jawan was killed in a gunfight in Udhampur district’s Sohan village.","Security forces launch cordon-and-search operations in upper reaches of Kishtwar, Doda and Poonch districts.

Russia claims Putin targetted in attack

Third day of powercuts for Ukrainians after Russian attack

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday expressed concern over reports that the residence of Russian President Vladimir Putin had been targeted and called for restraint and a renewed focus on diplomacy.In a post on X, PM Modi said he was 'deeply concerned' by the reports and stressed that diplomatic engagement remained the best way forward.

Ongoing diplomatic efforts offer the most viable path toward ending hostilities and achieving peace. We urge all concerned to remain focused on these efforts and to avoid any actions that could undermine them,"" he said.Russia earlier claimed that Ukraine had launched a drone attack on President Putin’s state residence located between Moscow and St Petersburg. According to Reuters, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov alleged that 91 long-range drones were fired at the residence in the Novgorod region on December 28–29, all of which were intercepted and destroyed by Russian air defences.Lavrov described the incident as a “terrorist attack” and said Moscow would revise its negotiating position on ending the Ukraine war.He added that Russia had already selected targets in Ukraine for what he called “retaliation strikes.”Ukraine rejected the accusation. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy dismissed Russia’s claims as “lies,” alleging that Moscow was using the narrative to justify further attacks on Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv. “This alleged ‘residence strike’ story is a complete fabrication intended to justify additional attacks against Ukraine, as well as Russia’s refusal to take necessary steps to end the war,” Zelenskyy said.He added that Ukraine does not take actions that undermine diplomacy, accusing Russia of doing the opposite, and urged the international community not to remain silent as efforts continue toward achieving a lasting peace.For three days following the latest Russian air attacks on Ukraine, residents have been without electricity or heating in Vyshhorod, a satellite town about 20 km north of Kyiv.As night-time temperatures fall to around minus 3 degrees Celsius, they spend much of the day in a small shelter equipped with heat and electricity, where they can also power their gadgets and devices.Around 20 people gather in the modest building—described on a sign outside as an “islet of warmth and power”—charging mobile phones and laptops to stay connected and continue working.","PM Modi says he is 'deeply concerned' by reports of the targeting of the residence of the President of the Russian Federation.

CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu police have detained four 17-year-old school dropouts for hacking a 20-year-old migrant worker from Odisha with sickles near abandoned railway quarters in Tiruttani, a temple town on Chennai's northwestern fringe, after filming the assault to post as a social media reel.The victim, K Suraj, recently arrived in Chennai following a family dispute and had been surviving on menial jobs, police said Monday.The attack unfolded Saturday evening aboard a Chennai-Tiruttani EMU local train. At Thiruvalangadu station, about 70km northwest of Chennai, the four juveniles boarded Suraj's compartment, allegedly drunk & carrying two sickles concealed in bags. Investigators said they planned to use the weapons while recording content for social media.A brief exchange in Hindi escalated into an argument that continued until the train reached Tiruttani station, around 90km from Chennai. After disembarking, the youths allegedly forced Suraj towards the railway quarters near the tracks. Three attacked him with sickles, with one flashing a ""victory sign"", while a fourth recorded the assault on a mobile phone, police said.Suraj suffered deep cut wounds. Bleeding heavily, he staggered to a nearby road, where passers-by alerted railway police. He was taken to Tiruttani govt hospital and later referred to Tiruvallur Govt Medical College Hospital, where doctors said his condition was stable. Police traced the suspects using the video uploaded to Instagram, locating them later that night near Gangai Amman temple along the Tiruttani-Arakkonam bypass, a highway stretch on the town's outskirts, where they were allegedly drinking.Produced before the Juvenile Justice Board, three were sent to a govt observation home. The fourth, described as differently abled, was released to his parents with a warning.","Four 17-year-old school dropouts detained for hacking migrant worker with sickles.

'Called Chinki, Chinese, Momo': Tripura Student’s Killing In Dehradun Triggers Protests Across State

'Tragic that patriotic people of northeast are referred to as Chinese and attacked'

DEHRADUN: A 24-year-old MBA student from Tripura, who confronted a group of men hurling racial slurs at him and his younger brother, died in a Dehradun hospital on Friday after fighting for his life for over 14 days. The stabbing happened on Dec 9, minutes after Anjel Chakma said, ""We are not Chinese... We are Indians. What certificate should we show to prove that?"" The six men allegedly responded with brutal violence.What began as a regular grocery run to the local market in the Selaqui area of Uttarakhand's capital city turned into a fatal confrontation that evening.Anjel and his brother Michael, both students in Dehradun for over a year, were stopped and taunted by a group of men who allegedly referred to them in derogatory terms. When Anjel calmly stood his ground, the situation turned uglier.Michael would later tell police and friends how his brother calmly but firmly corrected them. That assertion, of identity and dignity, was met with knives. ""Soon after Anjel replied, they attacked him and his brother while hurling abuses,"" said a friend of Anjel's, who remained at the hospital through the two weeks that followed. ""Anjel suffered serious injuries to his neck and spine.Michael is also injured and still in a serious condition. ""The friend requested anonymity, but his voice carried anger and disbelief. ""He was one of the calmest, friendliest people. We're all broken by what happened."" Anjel's body was flown to Agartala on Saturday, as Tripura erupted in anger. His family was assisted by Pradyot Bikram Manikya Debbarma, chairman of Tipra Motha Party and a member of the erstwhile Tripura royal family, who had been in touch with the family since the day of the incident and had supported his medical treatment.Speaking to TOI, Debbarma said on Saturday, ""It's tragic that the patriotic people of the northeast are called Chinese and attacked. Those who hurl racist slurs forget that it is because of the brave people of the northeast that China cannot enter the country. These incidents don't just hurt families. They divide our people. And when we are divided, we are vulnerable. We don't want that. We want justice.""Suraj Debbarma, state president of Youth Tipra Federation, the youth wing of Tipra Motha, who helped coordinate Anjel's last rites, said: ""People from the northeast face racial slurs and xenophobic attacks in the north regularly. But when students from north Indian states come to central institutions in the northeast, they are welcomed like fellow countrymen. We lost an innocent soul in a hate crime. That's the tragedy. ""Police said the case was registered on Dec 12 on a complaint filed by Michael Chakma, 21. Five of the six accused - including two juveniles - were apprehended on Dec 14.Senior sub-inspector Jitendra Kumar of Selaqui police station said on Sunday, ""Yagya Awasthi, the main accused, is suspected to have fled to Nepal... Two police teams have been dispatched to track him down and nab him, and a reward of Rs 25,000 has been announced. After Anjel's death, we added additional BNS sections - 103(1) (murder) and 3(5) (committing crime with common intention).""Initially, the FIR was filed under BNS sections 115(2) (voluntarily causing hurt), 118 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons), and 351(3) (criminal intimidation). On Dec 14, based on doctors' statements, sections 109 (attempt to murder) and 61 (criminal conspiracy) were added.The charges were upgraded again after Anjel's death. Friends recalled how Anjel, in his final days, struggled but never regained full consciousness. Protests have begun in colleges in the northeast, demanding a national law against racial hate crimes.

Unnao Rape Case: Activists Protest Outside Delhi High Court Over Sengar Bail

Aishwarya Sengar's big charge after SC order in Unnao case

NEW DELHI: Ishita Sengar, daughter of former BJP MLA and Unnao rape case convict Kuldeep Singh Sengar, penned an open letter on Monday saying that she is “exhausted, frightened and slowly losing faith”.Her statement came after the Supreme Court stayed a Delhi high court order that had suspended her father’s life sentence.In her letter, Ishita wrote: “I am writing this letter as a daughter who is exhausted, frightened, and slowly losing faith, but still holding on to hope because there is nowhere else left to go.”The Supreme Court stayed the operation of the December 23 Delhi high court order and directed that Kuldeep Singh Sengar shall not be released from prison in connection with the 2017 Unnao rape case.A three-judge vacation bench comprising Chief Justice of India Surya Kant and Justices JK Maheshwari and AG Masih passed the order while hearing a plea filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The bench observed that although courts usually do not stay bail orders once a convict is released, the present case involved “peculiar facts” as Sengar remains in jail in another criminal case.“We are conscious of the fact that when a convict or an undertrial has been released, such orders are not ordinarily stayed by this court.But in view of the peculiar facts where the convict is convicted for a separate offence, we stay the operation of the Delhi High Court order,” the bench said.Also read: 'Will ensure Kuldeep Sengar is given death sentence- Unnao rape survivor hails SC decision; what she said Kuldeep Singh Sengar, an expelled BJP MLA from Unnao, was sentenced to life imprisonment in December 2019 for the rape of a minor under the Indian Penal Code and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. He is also serving a separate 10-year sentence in a CBI case related to the custodial death of the rape survivor’s father.In her letter addressed to the “Hon’ble Authorities of the Republic of India,” Ishita Sengar said her family had waited silently for eight years, trusting the legal system.Explaining why the family chose not to protest publicly, she wrote: “We chose silence not because we were powerful, but because we believed in institutions. We waited because we believed that truth does not need spectacle.”She alleged that despite being labelled “powerful” because of her father’s political identity, her family remained unheard.“People call us ‘powerful.’ I ask you what kind of power leaves a family voiceless for eight years?” she said. Ishita added that her family had been “drained financially, emotionally, and physically” while seeking justice.Also read: SC stays Delhi HC order granting bail to Kuldeep Sengar; ex-BJP MLA to remain in jail Ishita also claimed she had received rape and death threats on social media over the years, which eventually silenced her.“Over these years, I have been told countless times that I should be raped, killed, or punished simply for existing,” she wrote, describing the abuse as “daily” and “relentless.”She further expressed concern that fear and public outrage were beginning to overshadow facts and due process.“If pressure and public frenzy begin to overshadow evidence and due process, what protection does an ordinary citizen truly have?” she asked.Clarifying her intent, Ishita said the letter was not written to seek sympathy or special treatment.“We are not asking for a favour. We are asking for justice because we are human,” she wrote, urging that the law be allowed to function “without fear” and evidence be examined “without pressure.”During the Supreme Court hearing, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the CBI, described the case as a “very horrific” instance of child rape and argued that Sengar, being an MLA at the time, occupied a dominant position over the victim, attracting stricter punishment under the POCSO Act.The bench also expressed concern that excluding lawmakers from the definition of “public servant” under POCSO could create legal immunity for MPs and MLAs.Meanwhile, the rape survivor’s mother welcomed the Supreme Court’s order, saying it gave her hope that her daughter would finally get justice.The Supreme Court has issued notice to Sengar and sought his response within four weeks. The matter is scheduled to be heard again in the last week of January.Following the apex court’s decision, Kuldeep's daughter Aishwarya Sengar alleged that her family was not given an opportunity to present its arguments on the merits of the case and claimed that key facts were being overlooked.“We couldn’t even start arguing on the merits of the case today, that she has changed her statement several times, changed the timing thrice, starting from 2 pm, 6 pm and then finally 8 pm. There’s a finding of the AIIMS medical board that she was more than 18. I’ve been fighting for justice for the past eight years, but maybe the sorrows of me and my family mean nothing. We have been stripped of our dignity, our peace, and even our fundamental right to be heard. Still hope for justice. I request that the media not spread any misinformation,” Aishwarya said.","Ishita Sengar penned an open letter on Monday saying that she is “exhausted, frightened and slowly losing faith” Her statement came after the Supreme Court stayed a Delhi high court order that had suspended her father’s life sentence.

BJP-Led Mahayuti Sweeps Maharashtra Local Body Polls; PM Modi, CM Fadnavis Hail Victory

NEW DELHI: Union minister Ramdas Athawale on Tuesday termed his party RPI(A)’s exclusion from Mahayuti seat-sharing seat-sharing for BMC polls as ""betrayal of trust"". He said that his party would contest on 38 seats, however, adding that he would ""support the BJP and Shiv Sena on other seats. """"Since the formation of the Mahayuti, we have stood by the alliance with complete sincerity and firmness. However, what has happened today regarding seat-sharing is nothing but a betrayal of trust,"" he said in a post on X.Taking a stand for the ""dignity"" of party workers, Athawale released the candidate list and said that it is ""absolutely essential for the Ambedkarite community's power to participate in governance.""""The BJP offered a proposal for just 7 seats late at night, but putting up candidates in new locations at the eleventh hour is now impossible. Even though our strength in Mumbai is greater than that of the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA), we were sidelined in the seat allocation, which has caused intense resentment among RPI workers across Maharashtra. We are not like other leaders who repeatedly twist words or change their stance as it suits them.Fundamentally, we cannot accept any compromise that forgets the party, the workers, and their self-respect, because the workers' strength is the party's true strength,"" he said.""Therefore, we will not take any stance that puts the workers' dignity and the party's existence at stake. Our word and our loyalty are rock-solid. From a broader perspective, it is absolutely essential for the Ambedkarite community's power to participate in governance and, through that, to keep the work for the common people going unceasingly. It is with this seriousness in mind that we have decided to stay with the MahaYuti. Many more decisions can be taken after the election results, but it is now clear that we will contest 'friendly fights' on 38 to 39 seats. Even though our support for the MahaYuti remains firm, on these seats the RPI will demonstrate its strength,"" he added.BJP MLC Pravin Darekar met Athawale and later, speaking to the reporters, he said that ""his participation in the government and his respect will be ensured in a dignified manner.""""Ramdas Athawale is not upset; he is with the Mahayuti alliance. But he has his own party, so there is pressure from his party workers. Every party's workers feel they should contest the elections... There are 227 seats and thousands of workers who are interested in contesting elections... I believe that after discussing this with the chief minister, his participation in the government and his respect will be ensured in a dignified manner,"" he said.Even as the BJP and Shiv Sena have declared a seat-sharing arrangement, another Mahayuti ally—the NCP led by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar—is fighting the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation elections on its own.Meanwhile, the last date for filing nomination papers for the January 15 elections to 29 municipal corporations across Maharashtra ends on Tuesday.","Ramdas Athawale's party RPI(A) excluded from Mahayuti seat-sharing seat- sharing for BMC polls.

Bangladesh's first woman PM to embattled mass leader

JALPAIGURI: Grief over former Bangladesh PM Khaleda Zia's death on Tuesday travelled well beyond Dhaka, reaching Jalpaiguri, a north Bengal town nearly 434 km away, where memories of her early life still lingered. For the people here, it was a loss of one of their own.Khaleda Zia was born in Jalpaiguri in 1946 and spent her early life in the town, attending two primary schools before her family eventually moved to what was then East Pakistan, now Bangladesh.""Zia's father, Mohammad Iskandar, used to work as an agent at my father's tea trading firm, Das & Co. Khaleda Zia was born at their Nayabasti house in the town. Even after Partition, her family continued to reside in Jalpaiguri, and family moved to erstwhile East Pakistan only in the 1950s,"" recounted Jalpaiguri resident and businessman Nilanjan Dasgupta.According to Jalpaiguri-based historian Umesh Sharma, Zia's early education began in the town. ""Zia was sent to Jogmaya Primary School in Nayabasti, where she studied up to Class III, and was then admitted to Sunitibala Sadar Girls' School in Samaj Para,"" he said. ""By then most of their relatives moved to East Pakistan, and Zia's father migrated there,"" Sharma added.Sharma said the family's departure followed a formal exchange of property.""Iskandar went for a property exchange with one Amarendranath Chakraborty and moved to East Pakistan. Chakraborty's family still lives in the house at Nayabasti,"" he said.Those who remember her family recall the emotional ties that endured long after her departure. ""Siyon Mandal, who became a teacher at Sishu Niketan Prathamik Bidyalaya, was her best friend during primary school days. I remember how Siyondi was elated when Zia came to office in Bangladesh. The news of her demise has left people who knew her sorry,"" said Dasgupta, a former proprietor of now-defunct Das & Co.Neighbours, too, spoke of a bond that survived borders and decades. ""Zia's niece came only a couple of months ago to see Zia's birthplace. We talked about how good it would have been if the country was never partitioned. Her loss is mourned by people in Bangladesh as well as here,"" said Suhrid Mandal, Zia's Jalpaiguri neighbour.","Khaleda Zia was born in Jalpaiguri in 1946 and spent her early life in the town.

HYDERABAD: An old man bends over granite slabs waiting beside a neatly edged pit. Plants line edges. This is not a garden. It is preparation for death. It is his grave.Nakka Indrayya, 80, has dug his own resting place in Jagtial district of northern Telangana, about 200km from Hyderabad. He chose a plot close to where his wife is buried. He did not ask his four children to do it. He did not leave it to fate.""It is my home which I have dug for myself,"" Indrayya said after returning from his daily visit. Every morning, he waters plants, cleans surroundings, and sits quietly by the grave. What others find unsettling does not bother him. ""It is where I will be laid after my death, so I made it in the design that I wanted,"" he says.The grave is 5ft deep, more than 6ft long, built entirely of granite so it will not decay. The cost is about Rs 12 lakh. A mason from Tamil Nadu helped construct it. ""All that one has to do is take a crowbar and move the granite on the top,"" Indrayya said, explaining how the burial will work. ""Once I am buried, the granite will be pushed back to seal it.""The resolve comes from a life shaped early by loss. He was 10 when his father died. Soon after, Indrayya began working - first as a local labourer, later spending 45 years in Dubai's construction sector. His wife died a few years ago. He returned home with savings, solitude, and clarity. ""I didn't want to be a burden on anybody,"" he said. ""There is no need to fear death. Everyone will die. I know I will die too. I also know where I will be buried. "" Each day, the man walks back from the grave to his home in Laxmipur village.

'Called Minor Matter, Refused FIR': Tripura Student Angel Chakma's Father Blasts Uttarakhand Police

Dehradun: Anjel Chakma, 24, a native of Tripura, had grown up across several states as his father served as a BSF head constable, moving from one posting to another. Family members said the frequent relocations shaped his childhood and made him adaptable, grounded, and aware of life's uncertainties from an early age. He was known to be calm, friendly, and non-confrontational, rarely getting into arguments or disputes.Earlier this month, Anjel was assaulted in Dehradun in what police have described as an alleged racist attack. He was attacked by a group of six individuals and sustained critical injuries, following which he died. Police arrested five of the accused, including two juveniles, while one accused remained absconding at the time. The incident triggered outrage among students and people from the northeastern states, who said the attack highlighted concerns over racial targeting and safety of youths from the region living and studying outside their home states.About a month ago, Anjel crossed a milestone the family had long waited for. After securing his first job through a campus placement at a French MNC, he returned home with plans already forming.Soon after sharing the news, he told his father that it was time to rest. ""You've done enough for us,"" he said, asking him to opt for the voluntary retirement scheme after years of service and constant movement.With his first salary in sight, Anjel began planning a more settled future for the family. He spoke about seeking a posting in Guwahati or Kolkata so he could remain closer to Tripura and asked his mother to be ready to move in with him once he settled. Relatives said he wanted to take on responsibility at home and had told them he would support the family financially, including funding his younger brother Michael's higher studies to ease the burden on his father.Anjel's maternal uncle, Momen Chakma, who had watched him grow up, said the young man's experiences across different states had made him mature beyond his years. ""He understood life's challenges very well and always wanted to support the family,"" he said. ""He never got into fights or brawls and preferred travelling and visiting new places whenever he got time.""It was that interest in travel and the outdoors that drew Anjel to Uttarakhand. He admired the state's hill terrain and spoke often about trekking routes and mountain trails. He persuaded Michael, 21, to pursue higher studies from Dehradun and encouraged him to explore the region beyond classrooms and hostels.The brothers had planned a Chandrashila trek on Dec 22, after Michael's examinations were to end. Anjel had discussed the route, checked the weather, and ordered new trekking shoes for the trip, looking forward to spending time together in the mountains he admired. The trekking shoes arrived at his house a day after he was attacked. They still remain unpacked.","Anjel Chakma, 24, a native of Tripura, had grown up across several states as his father served as a BSF head constable.

Saudi-UAE Clash: MBS' Ultimatum To Al Nahyan After Blowing Up Weapons | ‘Don’t Cross Our Red Line!’

What happened in Mukalla

What is the STC?

A ‘red line’ between Saudi and UAE

What the UAE said

Why the east matters to Riyadh

Yemen’s leadership steps in

Why this matters for Yemen

(With inputs from agencies)





Saudi Arabia’s airstrikes on Yemen’s southern port city of Mukalla this week have exposed a sharp and public rupture inside what was once a unified Gulf-backed coalition.What began as a complex war against the Iran-aligned Houthi movement has now evolved into an open confrontation between partners who once fought on the same side.The strikes followed the arrival of two vessels from the UAE port of Fujairah, which Saudi Arabia says unloaded weapons and armoured vehicles destined for the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council (STC), a separatist force seeking self-rule in southern Yemen. Riyadh described the shipments as an “imminent threat” to its national security and warned that Emirati actions were “extremely dangerous”, language that underscored the seriousness of the fallout.At the heart of the dispute lies Saudi Arabia’s fear that instability in Yemen’s eastern provinces, particularly Hadramout and al-Mahra, could spill directly onto its borders.Saudi warplanes struck targets in Mukalla after the Saudi-led coalition accused two ships of arriving without authorisation, disabling their tracking systems and unloading “a large amount of weapons and combat vehicles” to support the STC.Riyadh said the operation was limited, conducted overnight, and aimed at preventing collateral damage.“The crews had the disabled tracking devices aboard the vessels and unloaded a large amount of weapons and combat vehicles in support of Southern Transitional Council’s forces,” the coalition said. “Considering that the aforementioned weapons constitute an imminent threat, and an escalation that threatens peace and stability, the Coalition Air Force has conducted this morning a limited airstrike.”Footage aired by Yemeni state media showed black smoke rising from the port and burned vehicles near the docks. Saudi state media said there were no casualties, though local residents reported damage to nearby homes.The Southern Transitional Council (STC) is a separatist movement in southern Yemen that seeks autonomy or independence for the region. It was formed in May 2017 following mass protests in the southern port city of Aden over the dismissal of its leader, Aidarus al-Zoubaidi, who now heads the council.The STC’s stated goal is to “reinstate the Southern State”, referring to the independent country that existed in South Yemen between 1967 and unification with the north in 1990. Support for southern secession has long existed, but gained momentum after Yemen’s civil war erupted in 2014.Backed by the United Arab Emirates, the STC controls key territory in the south, including Aden, and commands armed forces known as the Southern Armed Forces. While it has at times shared power with Yemen’s internationally recognised government, its core demand for southern self-rule remains unchanged.The STC now faces a critical test. It is part of the Presidential Leadership Council, yet its forces have seized swathes of territory from Saudi-backed units. Its leadership insists the UAE remains a “main partner” in the fight against the Houthis and has rejected Al-Alimi’s orders, saying they lack consensus.While the STC has framed its advance as consolidating southern control, defying Riyadh carries risks. Saudi Arabia controls Yemen’s airspace and has made clear it will act to prevent any shift that threatens its security interests.Saudi Arabia and the UAE were once the twin pillars of the coalition formed in 2015 to restore Yemen’s internationally recognised government after the Houthis seized the capital, Sanaa. While both opposed the Houthis, their long-term goals increasingly diverged.Riyadh has remained committed to a unified Yemen under the internationally recognised government. Abu Dhabi, by contrast, has backed the STC, which seeks to revive the formerly independent state of South Yemen. That divergence has now erupted into open confrontation.Saudi Arabia accused the UAE of pressuring the STC to carry out military operations near its borders, calling such actions a “threat to the kingdom’s national security”. “The Kingdom stresses that any threat to its national security is a red line,” the Saudi foreign ministry said, adding that it would not hesitate to act.The UAE rejected the accusations, saying the shipment “did not contain any weapons” and that the vehicles were intended for Emirati forces operating in Yemen. It condemned any attempt to implicate it in operations threatening Saudi security and called for restraint and coordination.The UAE said it was surprised by the Saudi airstrike and rejected allegations that it directed STC military operations.“The UAE categorically rejects any attempt to implicate it in the tensions between Yemeni parties,” its foreign ministry said, calling for restraint and coordination.Abu Dhabi said its presence in Yemen was at the invitation of the internationally recognised government and within the Saudi-led coalition framework. It urged that recent developments be handled “responsibly and in a way that prevents escalation”.Later in the day, the UAE announced that it would withdraw its remaining forces from Yemen.""The Ministry of Defence announces the termination of the remaining counterterrorism teams in Yemen,"" a statement from the ministry said, as cited by news agency AFP.The focus on Hadramout and al-Mahra is no coincidence. Hadramout borders Saudi Arabia and has deep economic and historical ties with the kingdom. Al-Mahra sits astride key land routes linking Yemen to Oman and Saudi Arabia and controls vital ports and crossings.For Riyadh, large-scale instability in the east is not a distant Yemeni problem but a direct border security issue. Saudi officials fear that unchecked STC expansion could redraw control over resource-rich areas and trade routes, creating long-term insecurity along the kingdom’s southern frontier.This explains why Saudi Arabia warned the STC against advancing into Hadramout and demanded a withdrawal, a call the separatists dismissed.The escalation was framed politically through Yemen’s internationally recognised leadership. Rashad al-Alimi, head of the Presidential Leadership Council, cancelled a defence pact with the UAE and ordered Emirati forces to leave Yemen within 24 hours. In a televised speech, he accused Abu Dhabi of fuelling strife by backing the STC.“Unfortunately, it has been definitively confirmed that the United Arab Emirates pressured and directed the STC to undermine and rebel against the authority of the state through military escalation,” he said.Al-Alimi also imposed a temporary no-fly zone and a sea and ground blockade on ports and crossings, except for coalition-approved exemptions, signalling the seriousness of the moment.The escalation risks opening a new front in Yemen’s decade-long war, with anti-Houthi forces turning on each other while the Houthis remain entrenched in the north, including in Sanaa.More than ten years of conflict have already killed over 150,000 people and created one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. Strategic southern regions now at the centre of the dispute hold key ports and most of Yemen’s oil reserves.","Saudi Arabia and the UAE were once the twin pillars of the coalition formed in 2015 to restore Yemen’s internationally recognised government.

I am sorry for what happened, but nobody knows why she’s out there in a glittering pant suit in a recreated tent that her husband tragically was murdered in throwing merch out. She’s out there talking to Nicki Minaj. People are confused. What’s going on?

The appearance came weeks after Minaj publicly voiced support for Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance.On stage, Minaj praised both leaders and made a slip of the tongue while speaking about Vance. Erika Kirk calmly responded, saying:“Trust me, there’s nothing new under the sun that I have not heard.So you’re fine. I love you. You have to laugh about it, truly.”Erika Kirk also reassured Nicki Minaj later, adding:“I love this woman. She has a soul and a heart for the Lord, and words are words. I know her heart.”After her husband’s reported death at a Utah Valley University event, Erika Kirk stepped into a leadership role at Turning Point USA. She has said she plans to continue the work and tours started by Charlie Kirk.Nicki Minaj, who once criticized Donald Trump’s immigration policies in 2018, has since shifted her public stance.

Kanpur Headlines Today — The Biggest Updates You Need to Know.

KANPUR: A 70-year-old retired railway clerk and his 27-year-old mentally challenged daughter were allegedly held captive and starved in their own house for five years by their domestic help couple in UP’s Mahoba district. The chilling case of cruelty came to light after the man, Omprakash Rathore, died.Some of his relatives, who reached the house on Monday after receiving news of Rathore’s death, were shocked by the scene there and called police. Rathore’s body had considerably shrunk, indicating he could have died a few days ago. His daughter was found in a dark room, looking skeletal. Rathore’s body was sent for autopsy, while his daughter was admitted to a hospital.Mahoba SP Vandana Singh said the postmortem report stated the cause of death to be chronic lung disease.“The deceased’s daughter was said to be mentally disabled and was found very weak at the scene. Family members have made allegations against the two domestic help. Investigation has revealed these two had been taking care of the deceased and his daughter for the past eight years,” she said.Rathore, his brother Amar Singh said, hired the couple as domestic help after his wife’s death in 2016 to take care of him and his daughter.However, driven by the greed to grab his property, the duo pushed him to death, he alleged. The couple gradually took over the entire house and confined the father and daughter to the ground floor rooms, while they lived comfortably on the upper floor.Singh alleged that the couple never allowed any relative to visit Rathore and his daughter, saying the two did not want to meet anyone.Relatives claimed that the couple had access to the bank accounts of the deceased and had even put their own nameplate on the house.Police, however, said the initial probe had revealed that Rathore’s family members had never made any attempt to take care of him and his daughter.“The allegations made by the relatives are being investigated. Action will be taken based on that,” said an officer.","Omprakash Rathore, 70, and his 27-year-old mentally challenged daughter were allegedly held captive and starved in their own house for five years by their domestic help couple.

PM Modi Accuses Congress Of Siding With Pakistan, Says Party Protects Infiltrators

BJP objects to rehab move

Draws Pakistan attention

Vote bank politics: Forums

BENGALURU: Deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar Tuesday rejected opposition allegations of minority appeasement in the govt’s handling of encroachments, asserting that there would be no “gifting” of land or benefits to encroachers and that strict action would be taken against those who facilitated illegal settlements.Responding to BJP charges that the Congress govt was pursuing minority appeasement politics with an eye on the Kerala assembly elections next year, Shivakumar said encroachments were unacceptable under any circumstances. “There is no appeasement politics. We will take action against those who facilitated the encroachment. The evictees have given statements that some people collected money and allowed them to set up their sheds there. We will give housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas scheme to the eligible evictees on humanitarian grounds,” he added.He added that previous land rights in the area would be reviewed, and recent encroachments thoroughly scrutinized. “Land rights were granted some time ago, and I’ve asked officials to verify these claims. Some outsiders have encroached more recently. We will identify the original settlers and ensure their rehabilitation,” he said.On criticism from Kerala MPs over his statement that encroachment issues were an internal matter of Karnataka, Shivakumar said: “ Yes, we are running our govt well. They can give whatever statement they want, we will not allow encroachments. They have not even delivered on their promises during previous floods and they don’t have any rights to talk about our state. We know how to govern our state,” he added.On comments made by Pakistan’s external affairs minister regarding the Kogilu encroachments, Shivakumar said: “Senior national leaders will respond to this.”On the BJP’s allegations that the evictees were Rohingyas from Bangladesh, he said officials would investigate reports that some evictees possessed identity cards from two states. On rehabilitation, he made it clear that only eligible local residents would be accommodated. “We will rehabilitate only the genuine eligible evictees. We are not regularizing it but will provide housing only to eligible locals,” he said.BJP continued to slam the Congress govt’s decision torehabilitate encroachers in Bengaluru whose houses were demolished, alleging that the move followed intervention by the All India Congress Committee (AICC).In Belagavi, BJP state president BY Vijayendra asked: “Should Karnataka’s policy decisions be taken by a Keralite KC Venugopal sitting in Delhi, or by the chief minister of this state?”He said the party would launch statewide protests after the BJP core committee meeting on Jan 5. “(Issues like) drug mafia, insult to Kannadigas and irregularities in the Gruha Lakshmi scheme will be discussed, and a statewide agitation will be decided,” he said.“Announcing houses for illegal migrants by throwing rules to the wind is completely illegal. Do the CM and DCM even have the legal authority to take such a decision?” Vijayendra asked, adding that the houses were built for poor Kannadigas using taxpayers’ money.He alleged discrimination against Karnataka’s poor, saying, “When Wayanad was hit by floods, the chief minister announced construction of 100 houses there and gave Rs 15 lakh compensation for elephant attack deaths. What injustice have Karnataka’s poor committed?”In Bengaluru, Union minister Shobha Karandlaje questioned whether the “heat of Kerala elections” was influencing decisions in Karnataka. “The state govt must cooperate in identifying and deporting Rohingyas and other illegal migrants,” she said, alleging outside interference. Warning against granting permanent status, she demanded verification of Aadhaar cards and voter IDs of suspected illegal migrants.The demolition of hutments in Kogilu has attracted international attention, reportedly sparking a diplomatic row with Pakistan.On Dec 20, 167 unauthorised temporary sheds in Waseem Layout and Fakir Colony were razed on grounds of encroachment.The issue escalated after Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan criticised the Karnataka govt, claiming the majority of affected residents were religious minorities and alleging targeted action against Muslim communities.Close on the heels of this development, Pakistan’s Foreign Office issued a statement accusing Indian authorities of harassing Muslims, demolishing homes with state support, and interfering with religious celebrations, labelling it a serious concern for minorities in India.India, too, responded firmly. External affairs ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal dismissed Pakistan’s statements as unacceptable and hypocritical,” adding, “India rejects comments coming from a country whose own record on minority rights is abysmal.”He further said Pakistan’s systematic and horrific victimisation of minorities of various faiths is a well-documented fact, and no amount of finger-pointing can hide that reality.” Officials clarified that Pakistan’s remarks were made without understanding the ground situation or official reports and were aimed at defaming India internationally.Domestically, the political row intensified with parties criticising each other for alleged vote bank politics.Deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar said: “There is no question of giving New Year gift to encroachers as we are not in favour of appeasement politics as alleged by opposition BJP and JD(S). We have reports about miscreants collecting money from the victims to give title deeds and we only want to help such vulnerable poor by allotting houses under the PM Awas scheme.”Civil society groups warned that displaced families were being used for political gain. M Venkataswamy, president of Samatha Sainika Dala, said: “All major parties are indulging in appeasing their respective vote banks taking political advantage of the Kogilu demolition. Poor people are being blatantly used as pawns by these parties for their political game.”Meanwhile, the govt has ordered rehabilitation for verified victims. Eligible families will receive alternative housing at Byappanahalli at a cost of Rs 11.2 lakh per house, following verification of documents, to address humanitarian concerns amid increasing scrutiny.",Deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar rejects opposition allegations of minority appeasement in the govt’s handling of encroachments.

Pakistan army chief field marshal Asim Munir hosted his daughter’s wedding last week in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, where she was married to her first cousin, Abdul Rehman, according to Pakistani media reports.The ceremony was attended by senior political leaders and top military officials but was kept low-key due to security considerations, with no official photographs released.Among those present at the ceremony were Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari, prime minister Shehbaz Sharif, deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar, Punjab chief minister Maryam Nawaz, the chief of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), and several serving and retired senior army officers, including former army chiefs.Pakistani journalist Zahid Gishkori said around 400 guests attended the event, which was deliberately kept subdued.Gishkori, in a video posted on social media platform YouTube, confirmed the family connection between the bride and groom. “Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir's daughter Mahnoor married his brother's son, ex-army captain turned civil servant Abdul Rehman Qasim,” he said.The groom, Abdul Rehman, is Munir’s nephew. According to local media, he previously served in the Pakistan Army as a captain before joining the civil administration through a quota reserved for army officers.He currently serves as an assistant commissioner.Munir has four daughters, and last week's ceremony marked the wedding of his third daughter.The wedding coincided with the arrival of UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in Pakistan on the same day, prompting speculation on social media about a possible link between the two events. However, Ghiskori said that the UAE president did not attend the wedding.Pakistan’s security and foreign policy under Munir remains critical. A report by Greek City Times said that global patience with Pakistan’s trajectory toward “religious extremism” was wearing thin, alleging that the country had moved toward a more theocratic posture while failing to curb radical elements at home.Another report by Asian News Post criticised Islamabad’s military-led approach to regional diplomacy, particularly in relation to Afghanistan, stating that the strategy had failed to stabilise borders or improve Pakistan’s international standing.","Pakistan army chief field marshal Asim Munir hosted his daughter's wedding.

Mumbai election buzz: City set for multi-cornered BMC fight as nominations close; alliances trigger last-minute scramble,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-election-buzz-city-set-for-multi-cornered-bmc-fight-as-nominations-close-alliances-trigger-last-minute-scramble/articleshow/126263603.cms,"Poll battle in Mumbai

MUMBAI: With seat sharing within two major alliances (BJP-Shiv Sena and Shiv Sena UBT-MNS) finalised only late on Monday, the final day of filing nominations for the BMC polls on Tuesday saw a last-minute scramble for submission of forms. Several candidates were still in queue at 6pm to submit their duly-filled papers. Those who had queued up before the 5pm deadline were entitled to file their papers.In all, 1,668 candidates filed their forms on Tuesday for the Jan 15 polls to the country's richest civic body which will see a multi-cornered fight. Till a day ago, only 401 had filed papers. The last date for withdrawal is Jan 2, 2026.While there are three principal alliances in the fray - BJP-Shiv Sena, Sena (UBT)-MNS-NCP (SP), and Congress-Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi - two other political forces fighting on their own are NCP helmed by deputy CM Ajit Pawar and the Ramdas Athavale-led RPI(A). NCP, which has limited presence in Mumbai and is not part of the Mahayuti this time, has fielded 94 candidates (see gfx) for the total 227 BMC seats.RPI, which has been with Mahayuti at the Centre and the state levels, has demanded 12 seats from BJP’s quota and said it will otherwise contest 38 on its own in a ‘friendly fight’.While candidates who filed nominations are expected to hit the campaign ground running on Wednesday, netas have the task of pacifying rebels who are significant in number across parties because of the alliances that have been stitched together, permitting nomination from one party in an alliance in a single ward.While parties have until Jan 2 to get rebels to withdraw their papers, political rallies will take off from the start of the new year. With campaigning ending in the evening of Jan 13, parties and alliances have close to two weeks to drum up support for themselves.Of the major parties, only Congress, NCP and NCP (SP) released official lists of candidates; the rest distributed AB (party) forms to nominees directly in a bid to avoid rebellion.The BJP-Shiv Sena arrived at a 137-90 seatsharing arrangement after a week of negotiations, and the Sena led by Dy CM Eknath Shinde-led Sena distributed AB forms to all its 90 candidates early Tuesday. It has fielded almost all 40-odd former corporators who have switched over from the Uddhav Thackeray-led Sena (UBT).The Sena (UBT) and MNS have finalised a 165-52 pact, with 10 seats set aside for the Sharad Pawar-led NCP (SP). The MNS too distributed AB forms to its candidates on Monday night. The Congress is contesting 167 seats, and its ally VBA 60. Most Congress candidates had filed their forms on Monday; the rest did so on Tuesday.Defections and rebellions continued on the final day of filing nominations, with some candidates jumping ship at the last moment and being rewarded with tickets by rivals.The BMC election is a high-stakes battle especially for the Thackeray cousins who are fighting for political survival.","1,668 candidates filed their forms on Tuesday for the Jan 15 polls to the country's richest civic body.

The bus driver, during preliminary inquiry, reportedly admitted to a judgement error. Police have also summoned the driver who drove the bus before handing over the shift to Sawant.The arrested driver, Santosh Sawant (52), has been booked under BNS sections 105, 110 and 125 (A) (B) for culpable homicide not amounting to murder, attempt to commit culpable homicide, rash driving, and negligence and endangering life, as well as under the Motor Vehicle Act. He was produced before the Vikhroli Metropolitan Magistrate court which remanded him to police custody till Jan 3.Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis announced compensation of Rs 5 lakh for families of the victims. He offered his condolences to the families of the deceased and wished the injured a speedy recovery. BEST has also announced a Rs 2 lakh compensation to family members of the deceased, and medical help to the injured, a spokesperson said.What has perplexed the BEST management is that Sawant is an ""experienced driver working for nearly 15 years on full-time service with the undertaking"", though he has been operating e-buses since only three months. A senior official told TOI in all other major fatal crashes, the driver was on contract with wet lease operators. ""Sawant is our own driver, with a less stressful job and has good experience driving bigger buses, and we are surprised how he was responsible for negligence while driving a Midibus. ""His action brought back memories of a similar fatal mishap by a bus driver in Kurla in Dec last year, which claimed nine lives; trial in the case is yet to commence.The public prosecutor, while seeking Sawant's custody, argued they have collected his fingerprints to match with the steering wheel of the bus. ""It is not the case that he is a new driver. He has been driving the BEST bus since 2008 and he had knowledge his negligence would lead to disaster and yet he drove carelessly. We want to interrogate him and find the motive behind his act.""Sawant's lawyer S V Rane said, ""Firstly his alcohol test has come negative, secondly police have wrongly invoked Section 105 as there is no motive, he had no knowledge and the incident is purely an accident,"" said Rane. In his statement, Sawant said while taking a U-turn, he released the pulled hand brake and then accelerated, leading the bus to jump on the footpath.While he has been suspended, BEST general manager Sonia Sethi has instituted a high-level probe. BEST has announced sensitisation of all drivers, counselling for psychological and work-related stress issues from Wednesday.Meanwhile, a lawyer approached the Maharashtra State Human Rights Commission, urging it to take suo motu cognisance of the mishap and ensure inquiry.

Zelensky Admits Surrender Not An Option | 'Ukraine Can't Win War Without Trump's Help'

European leaders rally around Ukraine

Secretive residence





Ukraine said Tuesday there was no ""plausible"" evidence it launched a drone attack on one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's residences, accusing Moscow of peddling falsehoods to manipulate talks on ending the war.Ukraine's allies have expressed scepticism about Russia's claim.A French presidential source said the Kremlin's statements were not backed ""by any solid proof, including after cross-checking information with our partners"".Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has called Russia's claim a ""complete fabrication"", said he would meet with leaders of Kyiv's allies on January 6 in France in a bid to renew peace efforts.In comments to journalists on Tuesday, the Ukrainian leader repeated his assertion that the attack was faked and called on partners to verify this.""Our negotiating team connected with the American team, they went through the details, and we understand that it's fake,"" he said.The Kremlin said Tuesday it considered the alleged drone attack on Putin's secluded residence in the Novgorod region to be a ""terrorist act"" and a ""personal attack against Putin"".But it said it could not provide evidence for its claim as the drones were ""all shot down"".It also said the Russian army had chosen ""how, when and where"" to retaliate against Ukraine, and that Moscow would now ""toughen"" its negotiating position in talks to end Europe's worst conflict since World War Two.Russia has hit Ukraine with an almost daily barrage of drones and missiles for almost four years, killing thousands.European leaders rallied around Ukraine following Moscow's allegation. Zelensky said a summit of the so-called ""coalition of the willing"" -- a group of Western countries that have pledged further support for Ukraine -- would take place on January 6 in France.The summit would be preceded by a meeting of security advisors from the allied countries, Zelensky said on X, adding: ""We are planning it for January 3 in Ukraine.""Germany's Merz said on social media that Kyiv's allies were ""moving the peace process forward. Transparency and honesty are now required from everyone -- including Russia.""But US President Donald Trump -- who spoke to Putin on Monday -- directed criticism at Kyiv on Monday, despite Ukraine calling the incident staged.""You know who told me about it? President Putin, early in the morning, he said he was attacked. It's no good,"" Trump said.""It's one thing to be offensive because they're offensive. It's another thing to attack his house,"" the US leader said.Moscow has not said where Putin was at the time.The longtime Russian leader's residences are shrouded in secrecy in Russia -- as is much of his private life.The late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who died in an Arctic prison last year, had published investigations into Putin's luxury lakeside residence in the Novgorod region.Putin had been increasingly using the residence since the Ukraine war began, as it is more secluded and better protected by air defence installations, according to an investigation by RFE/RL.Moscow's allegation comes at a pivotal moment for diplomacy to end the war.Ukraine has said it has agreed to 90 percent of a US-drafted peace plan, but Russia has been hesitant to accept a deal that does not meet its maximalist demands.Putin has repeatedly said that Russia intends to seize the rest of Ukrainian land he has proclaimed as Russian if diplomacy fails.Russia's advance in eastern Ukraine picked up pace in the autumn, with Moscow's troops seizing more villages with every week since.Ukraine's navy on Tuesday blamed Russia for drone attacks on two civilian vessels in the Odesa region that Russia has been battering with strikes in the past weeks.Ukraine on Tuesday also ordered the mandatory evacuation of several villages in the northern Chernigiv region, which borders Moscow-allied Belarus, due to intense Russian shelling.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says he will meet with leaders of Kyiv's allies on January 6 in France in a bid to renew peace efforts.

The US administration has announced a new rule under which asylum access could be rejected on health risk grounds.

The Department of Homeland Security announced that the final rule of 2025, modified from the draft of 2020, will be effective on December 31. The rules explain when aliens may be ineligible for asylum or withholding of removal because they pose a danger to the security of the United States due to certain public health emergencies.Since the rules were drafted keeping in mind the Covid pandemic, it had certain provisions that are not applicable any more and those have been discarded, the DHS said. ""In the updated final rule, the Departments are withdrawing certain outdated amendments from the 2020 rule while leaving the rule’s practical public health-related provisions unaltered. These changes allow DHS and DOJ to retain the ability to consider public health risks as a security risk bar to asylum and withholding of removal in the event of a public health emergency. The 2025 final rule will become effective on Dec.31, 2025,"" the department said.The rule does not mean anything when there is no pandemic. And it would not have any immediate impact but would provide the administration a tool to turn away migrants seeking asylum in the US.It will affect people arriving during pandemics or outbreaks, or people who may have a serious communicable disease and who is refusing treatment.During the pandemic, the Trump administration used Title 42 to send migrants away from the border, saying that it was needed to limit the spread of the virus. While Title 42 is a public health law, the new rule is an immigration and asylum law.""On Dec. 2, US Citizenship and Immigration Services placed a hold on all asylum applications pending a comprehensive review. This final rule is an additional step in our ongoing efforts to support the priorities of the Trump administration by ensuring that aliens who would pose a danger to the security of the United States are not granted asylum or withholding of removal,"" the department said.","The rules were drafted during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 in President Donald Trump's first term but its implementation date was delayed.

I believe how women in leadership present themselves sends a message to younger women,” she told the outlet in a series of blistering interviews, as per the Daily Beast.“I have two daughters, and I’ve always been uncomfortable with how those women puff up their lips and enlarge their breasts. I’ve never spoken about it publicly, but I’ve been planning to.”Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, has long drawn scrutiny for the way women are presented or perceived.The “puffed up” lips and enhancements Greene referred to have become so ubiquitous among Republican women in the President’s orbit that it has earned its own trend moniker: “Mar-a-Lago face.”Loomer, a far-right commentator and staunch Trump ally, responded by posting video of Greene on stage at a Republican event with a cardboard cutout of Trump. In the clip, Greene pointed to the life-size image of Trump and told the audience: “This guy right here, he’s great, standing up there in the mucky swamp.” She then moved her hand around his groin area with what appeared to be a lewd gesture.“Also, what does she mean about sexualization?” Loomer asked on X.“Let me remind @RepMTG of this video of her sexually molesting a cardboard cutout of President Trump. MTG is a total fraud.”The post, in which Loomer also repeated claims of infidelity against Greene, followed earlier attacks this week. On Sunday, Loomer posted an article featuring Greene in a bikini on a beach in Costa Rica, where she is holidaying with her fiancé, MAGA reporter Brian Glenn.“‘America Only’ @RepMTG vacations in Costa Rica,” Loomer quipped, citing an unnamed source who reportedly told her Greene had bought a $5 million home there.Loomer also criticised Greene’s claim in The New York Times that Trump yelled at her over the Epstein files, with the President reportedly telling her: “My friends will get hurt.”“In reality, Epstein was a friend to Democrats,” Loomer wrote.The conflict between Loomer and Greene has become increasingly ugly in recent months as Greene broke ranks with the President on issues including the Epstein files, cost-of-living pressures, foreign wars and “America First” principles.Greene previously described Loomer as someone who “she psychotically turns on everyone” and said she is “the most unstable person and worst liability to ever walk in the Oval Office.”Both have spent years vying for Trump’s attention, but Loomer remained a loyal and influential ally of the President. At a Christmas Party at the White House this month, Trump described her as a “a very beautiful young woman,” and joked that she is “very low-key, not controversial at all.”",Laura Loomer and Marjorie Taylor Greene are locked in a war of words over the President's Mar-a-Lago club.
