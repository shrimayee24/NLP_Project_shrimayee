BENGALURU: Renukaswamy , a die-hard fan of Sandalwood star Darshan Thoogudeepa , was mudered after allegedly posting offensive and derogatory remarks on social media about Pavithra Gowda , an actress known to be his girlfriend.Bengaluru city police commissioner B Dayananda vowed on Tuesday that the authorities will bring the perpetrators of Renukaswamy's murder to justice.Following Darshan's arrest , social media has been outraged with comments, reactions and opinions from celebrities, activists and the actor's fans. In Karnataka, the situation has escalated to protests calling for a permanent ban on the Kannada star.A device believed to have been used to administer electric shocks to S Renukaswamy was recovered on Sunday night from the possession of the accused Dhanaraj, also known as Raju.According to a senior police officer, Dhanaraj had been evading arrest since June 10, when four individuals falsely claimed responsibility for Renukaswamy’s murder and surrendered.Police managed to persuade Dhanaraj to surrender with the help of his family and friends, tracking him down to Rajarajeshwarinagar on Sunday evening and promptly arresting him.The device seized from Dhanaraj was identified as a megger, an electrical instrument typically used to test and measure insulation resistance.The police officer further stated that during the assault on Renukaswamy, the accused had summoned Dhanaraj to bring the megger.Dhanaraj arrived at the parking area on his scooter and handed over the device to the other assailants, assisting them in using it to administer electric shocks to Renukaswamy.Renukaswamy was brutally beaten for four hours on Saturday afternoon in a seized-vehicle parking yard in Pattanagere, near RR Nagar, police reported.The autopsy revealed multiple injuries: heavy bleeding in the abdomen, a strong blow to the head, and blood on the groin, hands, feet, back and chest.Following the autopsy report on Thursday, Kamakshipalya police seized a mini truck (Ashok Leyland Dost) from the yard where the assault occurred.The truck had been repossessed by a bank for defaulted EMIs. According to suspect statements, the gang attacked Renukaswamy near this vehicle, holding his neck and repeatedly banging his head against it.During a site inspection on Wednesday, the accused pointed out the truck to the police, who then took it for further investigation.Police also seized wooden logs, a leather belt, and a rope from the Pattanagere shed, believed to have been used in the assault. These items, stained with blood, were sent to a forensic lab for analysis.According to the accused's confession, Pavithra was the first to assault Renukaswamy with her footwear before others joined in, at a seized-vehicle parking yard in Pattanagere, Rajarajeshwari Nagar, where he was held captive on June 8.Police recovered Pavithra's clothes during a search at her building, which also included Pavan K’s house on the ground floor.Police conducted searches at the homes of other accused individuals: Vinay in Pattanagere, where clothes and evidence were seized, and Deepak in BEML Layout, RR Nagar, where his clothes and footwear were collected. Four accused were taken to Chitradurga for a site investigation, and Arun Kumar was allowed to attend his father’s funeral. During a search at Arun Kumar's house, police found Rs 5 lakh cash and gold.Police initially searched Darshan's house in Rajarajeshwari Nagar and Pavithra's residence in Kenchenahalli for his clothes and footwear, not considering they might be at his wife's house.Darshan informed interrogators that his clothes and footwear from the crime day were at his RR Nagar residence. Police, along with FSL officials, searched his home late Saturday night and found his jeans and T-shirt on the terrace.When asked about his footwear, Darshan suggested checking a cupboard on the ground floor, but the shoes were not there. His aide, Pavan, mentioned that Darshan's costume assistant, Raju, might have taken the shoes to Mysuru. Police contacted Raju, who said he had given some items to Darshan's wife, Vijayalakshmi.Police reached Vijayalakshmi's apartment, and she brought Darshan's shoes to the security room. Darshan identified the blue loafers he wore on the day of the crime, which FSL officials then seized.Four individuals who initially confessed to the murder of 33-year-old S Renuka Swamy, citing a ""financial dispute,"" were allegedly promised Rs 20 lakh to cover up the involvement of Kannada film star Darshan in the crime, according to police officials.To ensure a thorough investigation, police conducted a comprehensive hair analysis on actor Darshan on Wednesday.This forensic method is crucial for determining a suspect's presence at a crime scene. Darshan and seven other suspects in the Renukaswamy murder case were taken to Victoria Hospital in the city for a medical examination.The actor underwent various tests, including the collection of samples from his natural hair, artificial hair weaves, and measurements of his hair's circumference. The examination lasted nearly three hours, according to hospital sources.","Darshan and Pavithra Gowda and 17 others were arrested with the murder of Renukaswamy, whose body was found in a stormwater drain in Kamakshipalya, Bengaluru.

Renukaswamy murder case: Loafers Darshan kicked his fan with found in wife’s flat; clothes seized,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/renukaswamy-murder-case-loafers-darshan-kicked-his-fan-withfound-in-wifes-flat-clothes-seized/articleshow/111098565.cms,"Given to Vijayalakshmi

BENGALURU: In a midnight operation , police probing the Renukaswamy murder case retrieved Sandalwood actor Darshan's loafers, allegedly used in the crime, from his wife Vijayalakshmi 's flat at Hoskerehalli in south Bengaluru.Renukaswamy was beaten to death, allegedly by Darshan, his girlfriend Pavithra Gowda , and his aides, on June 8. On Saturday, police had sought extension of the accused's custody, saying they had to seize Darshan's clothes and shoes as they were crucial evidence.Police initially thought that Darshan's clothes and footwear could be found either in his house in Rajarajeshwari Nagar or at Pavithra's residence in Kenchenahalli. They had not factored in the possibility of any of this material ending up in the house of the actor's wife, with whom his ties are said to be anything but cordial.According to sources, Darshan told his interrogators that he had kept the clothes and footwear he was wearing on the day of the crime in his RR Nagar residence. Police were hoping to find Renukaswamy's bloodstains on it.A team of police and FSL officials took Darshan and his aide Pavan K to his residence at Ideal Township in RR Nagar at 11.15pm Saturday. Darshan's employee Babul Khan opened the door. As informed by Darshan, police rummaged through a plastic bin on the first floor, but in vain. Darshan and Khan told them that there are possibilities that the domestic help might have taken the clothes for washing to the terrace. The blue jeans trousers of True Religion brand and a black round-neck T-shirt of Opium Valley brand, which the actor was wearing on the day of the crime, were found on the terrace.When asked about his footwear, Darshan took them to the ground floor and showed them a cupboard near the sitting room. But the loafers weren't there.Sources said Pavan told police that the footwear may have been taken to Mysuru by Darshan's costume assistant Raju when he went for shooting. Police contacted Raju over phone at 12.56am and went near his house in Attiguppe. He informed police that he had given a few clothes, shoes and other valuables of Darshan to his wife Vijayalakshmi. Police immediately contacted Vijayalakshmi, who replied that there were a few shoes of her husband at her home.According to sources, Vijayalakshmi asked police not to visit her flat as it was past midnight and she had a minor son at home. She informed police that she would bring all of Darshan's shoes near the apartment security room and they could check them there.Officials rushed to the Hosakerehalli apartment with Darshan. When police personnel reached the security room, Vijayalakshmi had kept a few shoes and other footwear there. Darshan identified the blue loafers he had worn that day. FSL officials seized them.Police commissioner B Dayananda told media that his team is working hard to ensure justice is delivered to the victim's family.","Renukaswamy was beaten to death, allegedly by Darshan, his girlfriend Pavithra Gowda, and his aides, on June 8.

: The state organ and tissue transplant organisation ( SOTTO ) set up at GMC under the ministry of health and family welfare in 2019 has 63 patients registered on the waiting list for kidneys.“Till date, five deceased donor organ transplants have been performed at GMC,” said SOTTO consultant Shraddha Kerkar at an awareness programme on organ and tissue transplant.“Eighteen organs have been donated including ten kidneys, four livers, three hearts and one lung and a total of 30 kidney transplants have been performed at GMC free of cost till date,” Kerkar said.The programme was held as part of a series of information campaign drives being conducted by SOTTO.Joint director, SOTTO, Dr Preeti Varghese appealed to people to be an organ donor to save people from diseases affecting heart, lungs, kidney, and liver besides corneal blindness, valvular heart disease, severe burns and amputation of hands.She spoke about the two types of organ donations. In living organ donation , a person, not less than 18 years of age during his life, can voluntarily authorise the removal of organs for therapeutic purposes legally.While in deceased organ donation, a person, regardless of age, can donate multiple organs or tissues and give life to many patients after brain-stem or cardiac death, she further said.","The state organ and tissue transplant organisation ( SOTTO ) set up at GMC under the ministry of health and family welfare in 2019 has 63 patients registered on the waiting list for kidneys.

"UK PM Rishi Sunak may lose his seat, Conservative Party heading for wipeout: Polls",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-pm-rishi-sunak-may-lose-his-seat-conservative-party-heading-for-wipeout-polls/articleshow/111126228.cms,"Rishi Sunak ’s Conservative Party is heading for an electoral wipeout in the UK general election on July 4, according to three major polls on Wednesday, including one that projected even the premier will lose his seat.Seat-by-seat analysis by Savanta and Electoral Calculus for the Daily Telegraph found the Tories are on track to win just 53 seats in next month’s vote, an all-time low for the 190-year-old party. YouGov put them on 108 seats — which would also be a record — while a More in Common survey for the News Agents podcast projected the governing party slipping to 155 seats. That would be 10 lower than in 1997, when the Conservatives last lost power to the Labour Party .Any of those results would be devastating for the Conservatives, who like to style themselves as the UK’s natural party of government, likely ushering in a lengthy period in opposition. Even worse for Sunak, the Savanta survey shows him losing his own seat of Richmond and Northallerton — which would be unprecedented for a serving prime minister — though the Tory Arthur Balfour lost his seat in 1906, a month after resigning as premier.“The Conservative party is set for the largest defeat in its history,” YouGov said in a statement. It said the governing party is set for “significant losses” in the South West, South East and East of England.All three polls put Labour leader Keir Starmer easily on course to enter Downing Street as prime minister: More in Common said the opposition is heading for a 162-seat majority, which in itself is approaching the Labour’s best-ever election result, the 179-seat majority secured in 1997 by Tony Blair . YouGov projects a 200-seat Labour majority; Savanta has them with a 382-seat advantage.Such numbers would have seemed fanciful just five years ago, when Labour slipped to its biggest electoral defeat since 1935 under Starmer’s left-wing predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn. More in Common sees Labour winning 406 seats, YouGov has them on 425 — a record — and Savanta sees them winning 516 seats — almost four in every five constituencies.The trio of surveys all project the Liberal Democrats will make significant gains, recovering their status as the UK’s third party, which they lost in 2015 after being punished by the electorate for serving five years in coalition with the Tories. More in Common put them on 49 seats — up 38 on 2019’s tally, while YouGov put them on 67 — which would be a record. Savanta puts them on 50, almost level with the Tories.YouGov sees Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage’s Reform UK party taking five seats, while the other two surveys have him winning none, despite recently overtaken the Tories in at least one national poll. A long fieldwork period may not have captured Reform’s recent rise in the polls, More in Common Director Luke Tryl said on the social media platform X.Separately, a constituency poll by Survation in Clacton, where Farage is standing as a candidate, showed him easily winning the seat with 42% of the vote, compared with 27% for the Tory incumbent, Giles Watling. Survation said it polled 506 adults in Clacton on behalf of Arron Banks, a long-time ally of Farage.While the More in Common survey projected a smaller Labour majority than other recent so-called multi-regression and post-stratification (MRP) modeling, a 162-seat majority would still be more than double that secured five years ago by former Tory Prime Minister Boris Johnson .“The fact that this projection showing the Conservatives barely holding 150 seats is one of the most favorable to the Conservatives shows how deep a hole the party finds itself in — with barely two weeks to go for them to change the dial,” Tryl said in a statement.Savanta found that in Richmond and Northallerton, Sunak is heading for a 29% vote share, compared to 34% for his Labour rival Tom Wilson. Still, the other two surveys see the prime minister retaining his seat relatively comfortably.","Tories on track to win just 53 seats in next month’s vote, an all-time low for the 190-year-old party.

Based on the footage of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin Wednesday, former CIA North Korea analyst Sue Mi Terry said Kim does not look healthy. “My first reaction looking at Kim Jong Un was, ‘Oof, he doesn’t look too great to me,’” Terry told CNN. “There was a time when he lost a little weight and he looked better. So my initial reaction was that he didn’t look, in terms of being healthy, because his health is something that we always track anyway,"" Terry said.Another thing that the former CIA analyst noted was how Kim made a big deal about Putin's arrival. The red carpet welcome to Putin made North Korea look like a normal country, she argued.Putin enjoyed a red carpet welcome, a military ceremony and an embrace from North Korea's Kim Jong Un during a state visit Wednesday to Pyongyang where they both pledged to forge closer ties. Kim hailed a ""new era"" in relations as he began summit talks with Putin, who in turn thanked his host for backing Russia's war in Ukraine.""We very much appreciate your systematic and permanent support of Russian policy, including on the Ukrainian issue,"" Putin said, according to Russian state media.After a welcoming ceremony in Kim Il Sung square, featuring a military band and mass synchronized dancing, Putin also invited his host to visit Russia.Putin said at the start of Wednesday's talks a ""new foundation document"" was ready to be signed that would set the framework for relations in the long term, as Kim spoke glowingly of the allies' ties. ""Relations between our countries are entering a new era of blossoming, which cannot be compared even with the period of Korean-Soviet relations of the last century,"" Kim said, according to Russian news agencies.The summit is their second meeting in a year, after Kim took his bulletproof train to Russia's far east last September for a summit with Putin at a space port.A Russian-made limousine, tea set and artwork are among the gifts exchanged by Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.Back in February, Putin gifted car-enthusiast Kim a Russian-made Auruses.","Putin enjoyed a red carpet welcome, a military ceremony and an embrace from North Korea's Kim Jong Un.

"Videos targeting Biden's age go viral, White House calls them 'cheapfakes'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/videos-targeting-bidens-age-go-viral-white-house-calls-them-cheapfakes/articleshow/111121116.cms,"Republicans are flooding the internet with out-of-context videos of US Prez Biden, using what the White House has characterised as deceptive editing tactics to cast the 81-year-old as infirm less than five months from Nov's election. The specious posts claiming to show Biden lost or freezing up underscore how increasingly bitter and personal the campaign has become online in the wake of former prez Donald Trump's criminal conviction and as attack ads ramp up ahead of the first debates. They also come amid some voters' worries over Biden's physical and mental condition, with Trump making age a top rallying point - despite being, at 78, just three years younger.The White House has branded the videos - many of which originated with an X account run by the Republican National Committee , or RNC - as ""cheapfakes"", a term misinformation experts coined to describe content altered using basic and affordable technology. One short clip the ""RNC Research"" account shared this month shows the prez hunching over during a ceremony in France to commemorate the anniversary of the D-Day landings. Conservative influencers jumped on the 13-second footage, falsely accusing Biden of trying to sit when there was no chair behind him. Others insisted he had lost control of his bowels. Jake Schneider, who runs the ""RNC Research"" account as the committee's rapid response director, said the page has merely been posting clips that ""come straight from pool feeds"".Rolling the tape further, however, makes it clear there was a seat beneath the prez. AFP fact-checkers found the RNC's video was cut to omit the ensuing footage, which revealed that Biden started to sit as the music stopped, paused to wait for defence secretary Lloyd Austin's introduction and then fully sat as Austin rose to speak. In another video spread widely online, Biden appeared to stray from other world leaders and flash an errant thumbs-up gesture during a skydiving demonstration at the G7 summit in Italy. After the GOP account highlighted the footage on X, the New York Post tagged Biden on its front page as the ""Meander in Chief"". But the New York Post's cover photos - and a video the newspaper shared online - altered the clip's frame to crop out the parachutists Biden was congratulating.White House pushed back. ""It's telling that rightwing critics, including Rupert Murdoch's sad little super PAC, the New York Post, resort to misinformation,"" Andrew Bates, its senior deputy press secretary, said. ""Biden's record is so threatening to them that they feel a need to make things up.""",Republicans flood internet with out-of-context videos of US Prez Biden.

A collision between a Philippine ship and a Chinese vessel occurred on Monday near the Spratly Islands in the disputed South China Sea , according to Beijing's Coast Guard .Beijing claims nearly the entirety of the South China Sea, a vital waterway facilitating over $3 trillion in annual maritime trade which is subject to overlapping claims by several nations, including China, the Philippines , Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei.China deploys various boats to patrol the waters and has transformed several reefs into militarised artificial islands. A series of confrontations between Chinese and Philippine vessels have occurred in disputed areas.New Chinese coast guard rules took effect on Saturday, June 15, which reinforce a 2021 law granting its coastguard the authority to use deadly force against foreign vessels in contested waters.Under these new rules, China's coastguard is empowered to apprehend suspected trespassers and detain them for up to 60 days without the need for a trial.In a statement, the Beijing's Coast Guard said, ""Philippine replenishment ship ignored many solemn warnings from the Chinese side"".It ""approached the... Chinese vessel in an unprofessional way, resulting in a collision"", the statement said.""The Chinese Coast Guard took control measures against the Philippine ship in accordance with the law,"" it added.Beijing accused the ship of having ""illegally broken into the sea near Ren'ai Reef in China's Nansha Islands"", using the Chinese name for the Spratly Islands.Manila has accused the Chinese coast guard of ""barbaric and inhumane behaviour"" against Philippine vessels, and President Ferdinand Marcos has called the new rules a ""very worrisome"" escalation.China has defended its new coast guard rules, with a foreign ministry spokesman saying last month that they were intended to ""better uphold order at sea"".The Group of Seven bloc criticised what it called ""dangerous"" incursions by China in the South China Sea on Friday.

He said the pier has so far allowed for a total of over 3,500 metric tons of aid to reach Gaza's shores.""With the caveat that this has always been intended to be a temporary pier, I'm not aware at this point of any established date of: This is when we're going to stop,"" he told reporters.""And again, taking a step back here, the big picture: Whether it be by land, sea or air, (the United States is) employing all avenues to get assistance into Gaza.""","The US military's on-again, off-again floating pier in Gaza is expected to resume operations on Thursday.

Louisiana: Louisiana becomes 1st state to make display of Ten Commandments must in public schools,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/louisiana-becomes-1st-state-to-make-display-of-ten-commandments-must-in-public-schools/articleshow/111121243.cms,"Louisiana has become the first state to require the Ten Commandments be displayed in all public school classrooms under a bill signed into law by Republican Gov. Jeff Landry. The law mandates a poster-sized display in “large, easily readable font” in classrooms from kindergarten through state-funded universities. Although Gov. Landry did not provide final approval, the time for gubernatorial action has lapsed, allowing the bill to become law.The legislation requires that the Ten Commandments be displayed alongside a four-paragraph context statement by the start of 2025. This statement will describe the historical presence of the Ten Commandments in American public education for almost three centuries. The posters will be funded through donations, as state funds will not be used to implement the mandate.Proponents of the law argue that the Ten Commandments are historically significant and describe them as “foundational documents of our state and national government.”“Even among those who may believe in some version of the Ten Commandments, the particular text that they adhere to can differ by religious denomination or tradition. The government should not be taking sides in this theological debate,” the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the Freedom from Religion Foundation said in a joint statement Wednesday afternoon.The law also authorizes, but does not require, the display of other historical documents such as the Mayflower Compact, the Declaration of Independence, and the Northwest Ordinance in K-12 public schools.Opponents have raised concerns about the law’s constitutionality, with civil rights groups and organizations that support the separation of church and state promising to file a lawsuit challenging it. These groups argue the law prevents students from receiving an equal education and could make students with different beliefs feel unsafe at school.Legal challenges over the display of the Ten Commandments in classrooms are not new. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1980 that a similar law in Kentucky was unconstitutional and violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits Congress from making laws respecting an establishment of religion. The high court found that the Kentucky law had no secular purpose and served a plainly religious purpose.Louisiana’s law emerges in a period of conservative leadership under Gov. Landry, who took office in January, succeeding two-term Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards. The Republican Party currently holds a two-thirds supermajority in the Louisiana Legislature, and all statewide elected positions are filled by Republicans, facilitating the passage of a conservative agenda.The law specifies that the Ten Commandments be displayed in a “large, easily readable font” and includes a context statement highlighting their significance in American public education history. This statement must explain how the Ten Commandments played a significant role in education for almost three centuries.“Even among those who may believe in some version of the Ten Commandments, the particular text that they adhere to can differ by religious denomination or tradition. The government should not be taking sides in this theological debate,” the groups said in their joint statement.This new law, unique to Louisiana, reflects ongoing tensions over the separation of church and state. As civil rights groups prepare for legal challenges, the state prepares for the mandate’s implementation. The outcome of these legal battles will likely set a precedent for other states that have proposed similar bills, including Texas, Oklahoma, and Utah, but have yet to enact them due to constitutional concerns.(With agency inputs)","Louisiana has become the first state to require the Ten Commandments be displayed in all public school classrooms.

The National Hurricane Center Wednesday announced the advent of Alberto, as it has been named. The storm was located about 185 miles (300 km) east of Tampico, Mexico, packing maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 kph), the Miami-based forecaster said. Alberto is likely to dissipate over Mexico Thursday or Thursday night.The storm is expected to produce rainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches (about 13 to 25 centimetres) across northeast Mexico into South Texas. Maximum totals around 20 inches (51 centimetres) are possible across the higher terrain of the Mexican states of Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, and Tamaulipas. Flash flooding is likely, and mudslides are possible in some areas, the centre said.The US National Weather Service said the main hazard for southern coastal Texas is flooding from excess rain. Eight inches (20 centimetres) of rain or more could fall by Saturday morning. On Wednesday, the NWS said, there is ""a high probability"" of flash flooding in southern coastal Texas. Tornadoes or waterspouts are possible.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts the hurricane season that began June 1 and runs through November 30 is likely to be well above average, with between 17 and 25 named storms. The forecast calls for as many as 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes.An average Atlantic hurricane season produces 14 named storms, seven of them hurricanes and three major hurricanes.

I write in the book I don’t know whether it’s because two guys from New York, him from Queens, me from Brooklyn, that we kind of understood each other and we got along very, very well early on.

The sale includes 291 Altius-600M systems, which are unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, with warheads. It also includes 720 Switchblade drones known as ""extended-range loitering munitions,"" the State Department said.

It said the sale ""serves U.S. national, economic, and security interests by supporting the recipient's continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability."" It will ""help improve the security of the recipient and assist in maintaining political stability, military balance, and economic progress in the region,"" the department said.

Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te thanked the US for approving the latest arms sale to Taiwan during a press conference Wednesday in Taipei. He said such authorizations help to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.

""In the future, we will continue to strengthen Taiwan's national defense strength, whether through ... military purchases or our own efforts,"" he said.

The incident unfolded on May 25 in Sargodha's Mujahid Colony, where Nazir and other Christians were accused of blasphemy , sparking violent outrage among locals.After fighting for his life for eight days, Masih succumbed to his injuries on Sunday.The incident showed a troubling pattern in Pakistan where blasphemy accusations lead to violence against Christian communities.HRFP has expressed deep concern over the swift post-arrest bail granted to 52 attackers involved in the Sargodha incident.Despite the First Information Report (FIR) being filed against 44 identified and 400 unidentified suspects under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) 1997 and Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), progress in police investigations and court proceedings has been slow and inadequate.Compounding the community's apprehensions are threatening videos released by Islamic groups following the incident, exacerbating fears among the Christian community.Drawing parallels with the August 16, 2023, attack in Jaranwala, the HRFP report highlighted similar incidents of mob violence and property destruction against minorities. It underscores a recurring pattern involving provocation, and subsequent violence, often followed by the expedient release of perpetrators.HRFP has called for decisive action, citing intelligence reports linking extremist groups to multiple blasphemy allegations. The organization has also urged stringent measures to address these threats.The report also documented individual cases of violence and harassment against Christians across Pakistan.Farooq Masih's family in Jaranwala continues to face threats. Despite the FIR filed in February, the perpetrators are still at large.Similarly, the case of Saima Bibi, who suffered an assault in April, was downplayed as an 'accident' despite clear evidence of the attack.The plight of Rawal Masih, Romeo Masih, Waqas Masih, Rakhsana Bibi, Asifa Bibi, Shazia Zaulfiqar, and Ahsan Masih, who all were abducted and murdered, also underscores the ongoing oppression faced by PakistChristians.Naveed Walter, president of HRFP, emphasized the ""dire circumstances"" for minorities in Pakistan and urged increased protection and support for the Christian community. He called for an end to the misuse of blasphemy accusations and fabricated justifications for violence, stressing the need for systemic reforms to ensure minority safety.The HRFP report underscores the urgent situation faced by Christians in Pakistan and advocates for international and local intervention to uphold human rights and justice.","Human Rights Focus Pakistan (HRFP) has published a detailed fact-finding report uncovering disturbing incidents of religious persecution against Christians.

NEW DELHI: In a heart-wrenching display of their persistent sorrow and discontent, families affected by enforced disappearances in the Balochistan region of Pakistan decided to abandon customary Eid festivities. Instead, they planned to stage a protest to voice their outrage against state agencies alleged to have perpetrated atrocities against the Baloch people.

Mama Qadir Baloch , a key member of the Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP), declared the protest in a video statement, asserting, ""For the past 15 years, the atrocities committed by the Army and intelligence agencies of Pakistan have led the Baloch to boycott Eid celebrations. While Muslims across the world celebrate this occasion, the Baloch mourn.""

Coinciding with this, families of the missing persons organized a sit-in protest at Shaheed Fida Chowk on Eid day, following a similar demonstration in front of the DC office just days prior. The earlier protest concluded after the district administration provided assurances to the families.

The decision to protest on Eid emphasizes the profound impact of enforced disappearances on the Baloch community, who have been tirelessly seeking justice and answers regarding the fate of their loved ones, allegedly taken by state forces.

Imran should stay in jail for 5 years: Pakistan minister,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imran-should-stay-in-jail-for-5-years-pakistan-minister/articleshow/111043178.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Former Pakistan PM Imran Khan will have to be kept behind bars for five years to maintain the country’s “economic stability”, minister Ahsan Iqbal said Sunday. The five years coincide with the full term of the current govt led by Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) that took office earlier this year.“People come to us and tell us that if Pakistan has to progress, then Imran Khan will have to be kept in jail for five years,” Iqbal, the minister for planning and development as well as PML-N secretary-general, said.His comments came hours after Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif pledged to rid the country of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), saying the next deal for a bailout package with the global lender would be the last in Pakistan’s history. IMF ties such loans to tough reform measures.According to Iqbal, if Imran came out of jail, “there would be sit-ins and fights again, which the country cannot afford”. “There is a voice of the people that Imran should remain in jail for five years,” Iqbal said. The minister added that the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder was an “angry man” and it wasn’t known with whom he had a quarrel.The minister also made a subtle jab at the legal system by claiming Imran always relied on the “shoulder of the judiciary” for support during trying times. The allusion appeared to be to some court orders that went in favour of Imran in recent times.Asked about confrontation between the judiciary and the military establishment, Iqbal replied: “Both should think whether this is better for the country.”Iqbal recalled the past when politicians used to fight the military and vice versa. “Now we must cooperate for the benefit of the nation because fighting between institutions has put the country’s sovereignty at stake,” the minister said.","Ahsan Iqbal says Imran Khan will have to be kept behind bars for five years.
