'BRICS Vampires': Navarro Targets India Again; Loses Cool After Russia Fact-Check On X, Poll Debacle

US President Donald Trump 's senior trade adviser Peter Navarro on Monday continued his rant and this time trained his guns at the member countries of Brics , calling them ""vampires"".Navarro claimed the member countries of Brics cannot survive without trading with the United States.""They’ve long hated each other—and none survive without selling to the United State."" he added.Trump's adviser raked up several examples where he tried to convince that the alliance is not working out.""The bottomline is that none of these countries can survive if they don't sell to the United States, and when they sell to the United States their exports, they're like vampires sucking our blood dry with their unfair trade practices. Let's see what happens. But I don't see how the BRICS stays together since historically they all hate each other and kill each other,"" he said.Also read: 'Too funny': Navarro's poll on X falls flat; Trump aide again guns for India ""Let's see how this is going to work out... Russia is getting into bed with China. China claims they own Vladivostok- the Russian port, and they're already through massive illegal immigration into Siberia, basically colonizing Siberia, which is the biggest landmass of the Russian semi-empire, so good luck with that, Putin, and then India, of course, is at war with China for decades.It was China that gave Pakistan a nuclear bomb. You got ships flying around the Indian Ocean now with Chinese flags. Modi, see how you kind of worked that out. Meanwhile, the Brazil economy is going down the tubes because of Lula's socialist policies- well, they keep the real leader of that country in a cell. Let's see what happens,"" he added.Earlier, Navarro had accused India of driving Moscow's war machine by importing discounted Russian crude.""FACTS: India highest tariffs costs US jobs. India buys Russian oil purely to profit/Revenues feed Russia war machine. Ukrainians/Russians die. US taxpayers shell out more. India can't handle truth/spins,"" Navarro wrote in a late-night post.Also read: 'It's blood money': Trump adviser Peter Navarro renews attack on India; slams X fact-check X users flagged Navarro's post with multiple community notes, correcting his assertions.The fact-checks stressed that India's Russian oil purchases are made for ""energy security"" and do not violate any international sanctions.This comes as US is in a tense trade and foreign policy standoff with India, following Washington's decision to impose punitive secondary tariffs on Indian exports for buying Russian oil.India has termed the tariffs imposed on it as “unjustified and unreasonable.”“Like any major economy, India will take all necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security,” India has said.",Trump's senior trade adviser Peter Navarro continued his rant against Brics.

SC stays projects in proposed Goa tiger reserve,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-stays-projects-in-proposed-goa-tiger-reserve/articleshow/123776893.cms,"PANAJI: In a major setback to Goa govt's ambitious plans to start hinterland tourism activities in five sanctuaries, Supreme Court on Monday granted a stay on carrying out any development activities in the proposed tiger reserve areas in state.SC, hearing a special leave petition by the state govt challenging a July 2023 Bombay HC order directing the state to declare Mhadei wildlife sanctuary and its surrounding areas as a tiger reserve in three months, referred the matter to Central Empowered Committee (CEC) and sought a report within two weeks. The bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justices K Vinod Chandran and A S Chandurkar said until the report is filed, and SC examines it, Goa govt would not carry out developmental work in the areas which are the subject matter of the Bombay HC order.Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi arguing for Goa said if the 2023 order for designating wildlife sanctuaries - Mhadei, Bhagwan Mahavir, Netravali, Cotigao and Bondla - as a 1,000sq-km tiger reserve is implemented, the state would have to earmark one-third of its entire geographical area as a protected zone. ""If in one-third of its geographical area is earmarked as tiger reserve, tigers will roam the streets not human beings,"" Rohatgi said and faulted the HC order for taking recommendation of National Tiger Conservation Authority as gospel truth.In response to the court's query as to whether any steps were taken by forest department pursuant to NTCA's recommendation to the state govt to notify Mhadei-Cotigao wildlife sanctuaries as a tiger reserve, senior counsel Normal Alvares appearing for NGO Goa Foundation said the state responded positively to the recommendation and demarcated 745.18sq-km as tiger reserve, which is why the HC directed it to notify the tiger reserve within three months.Goa State Board for Wildlife has already outlined a proposed core zone of 587sq-km and a buffer zone of 167sq-km within the existing protected areas, where no relocation is required. Alvares told SC the areas for the proposed reserve were already notified as wildlife sanctuaries and national park and that not an inch of Goa's land outside the existing protected areas was to be notified as a tiger reserve as per the area already demarcated by forest department.The bench said this issue would require further examination by the CEC, whose assistance in fact finding is taken by the Supreme Court in environmental matters.",Supreme Court on Monday granted a stay on carrying out any development activities in the proposed tiger reserve areas in state.

On Cam: Indian-Origin Sikh Man Shot Dead In Los Angeles; Video Released By US Police

Poll Should stricter laws be implemented regarding public behavior? Yes, definitely. No, that is unnecessary.

Jammu and Kashmir’s lone AAP MLA detained under PSA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jammu-and-kashmirs-lone-aap-mla-detained-under-psa/articleshow/123772325.cms,"Kulgam Gunfight: Terrorist Neutralized, JCO Sustains Injuries, Search Operation Ongoing

JAMMU/SRINAGAR: Aam Aadmi Party ’s J&K unit chief and Doda MLA Mehraj Malik was on Monday detained under the stringent Public Safety Act (PSA) on charges of disturbing public order.While the unprecedented action came amid a massive protest against Malik, the lone AAP MLA in J&K Assembly, by govt employees across the district for allegedly using abusive language against Doda district’s deputy commissioner (DC) Harvinder Singh and using a social media platform to target him, the move drew condemnation from political parties, with CM Omar Abdullah describing it as an assault on democracy.“There is no justification for detaining Mehraj Malik under PSA. He’s not a threat to ‘public safety’ & using this discredited law to detain him is wrong. If the unelected govt can use its powers against an elected representative like this then how does anyone expect the people of J&K to continue to have faith in democracy (sic.),” Omar said in a post on X.AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal also took to X and asserted that the MLA would continue raising his voice for the people. “Is demanding a hospital for the people of your area such a grave crime that an elected MLA has to be thrown in jail for it? Mehraj Malik is the lion of AAP,” Kejriwal said in his post.BJP and Sikh bodies, however, had criticised the MLA’s abusive behaviour with public functionaries, terming him a “habitual trouble maker” and calling for action against him.PAS was previously invoked against a number of political functionaries in J&K, including former CMs Farooq Abdullah, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti, who were detained after the abrogation of Article 370 and held in prolonged custody under the Act, an administrative law that allows a person to be kept in preventive detention for up to two years without charge or trial.Malik, who was held at Dak Bungalow before being shifted to district jail, addressed his followers online, saying, “I am fighting for people’s rights. It is not my family’s fight, it’s the fight for my people.”The row erupted after a police case was registered against the MLA under BNS for removing medical equipment and drugs from a govt-run Ayushman Arogya Mandir, Health and Wellness Centre, in Kencha village. In a statement online, Malik said he had already submitted a request to the Doda chief medical officer to relocate the health centre, as demanded by the people, to a more suitable site. But, at Singh’s behest, an FIR was filed against him for theft, he alleged, accusing the DC of attempting to “favour the mafia”.Protesting govt employees condemned the use of derogatory language and baseless allegations against the DC, terming them as “unfortunate, deplorable and unacceptable”, and lauded the officer for his exceptional service, integrity and dedication to public welfare, especially in flood-hit hilly district. The protesters accused the AAP legislator of habitually hurling abuses at senior govt officers and provoking youths against the official machinery.","Mehraj Malik was detained under the stringent Public Safety Act (PSA) on charges of disturbing public order.

When people’s sentiments came to the fore, the administration’s anger was directed at them instead. First of all, we need answers for the act that led to this situation. What was the need to install that plaque there? The present structure of the Hazratbal shrine was created by Sheikh Abdullah, and you will not find his plaque anywhere,” Omar said.According to NC’s Srinagar MP Aga Ruhullah, Jammu and Kashmir police have detained more than 30 people for allegedly defacing a plaque bearing the National Emblem inside Kashmir’s most revered shrine on Friday. Police have not issued any statement on the detentions so far.PDP president Mehbooba Mufti said her party would approach Hazratbal police station for the registration of an FIR against Andrabi for allegedly hurting the sentiments of Muslims by placing a plaque with the National Emblem inside the shrine.In a post on X, the former CM claimed PDP had approached “Nigeen police station” to file an FIR “but it was denied”. “I urge @JmuKmrPolice to initiate an FIR immediately given the gravity of the offence — deliberately hurting the religious sentiments of Muslims, thereby provoking them,” Mehbooba said. Her daughter, PDP representative Iltija Mufti, claimed, “Laws in Kashmir are being turned upside down on their head by being applied inversely. Instead of filing an FIR against the waqf chairperson for wilfully hurting religious sentiments of Muslims, police have caved in to her threatening orders by booking 50 civilians. No accountability for her hurtful irresponsible actions.”Andrabi, at the centre of controversy, is visiting shrines. On Sunday evening she visited Aasar-e-Sharif Jinab Sahib Soura Shrine Srinagar. After the visit she wrote on X, “Prayed for peace and harmony for all. Took stock of the ongoing construction works at the shrine campus, including the new grand mosque. Also reviewed facilities for devotees.”At the mausoleum of NC founder Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah on the latter’s 43rd death anniversary, NC politicians, including education minister Sakina Itoo, said the FIR in the case should be withdrawn and all “detainees should be released”. The minister sought action against the Waqf Board for “misusing the National Emblem”.J&K BJP spokesman Sajid Yousuf Shah said “whatever has happened at the Hazratbal shrine is debatable, whether a plaque with the National Emblem should have been there or not. But attacking the emblem and disrespecting the shrine is condemnable.” “Those who committed this heinous act are backed by political parties to divert public attention to hide their failures.” He said he expected “harsh punishment” for the culprits, “including those glorifying and shielding them”, and demanded that those who had “vandalised the Ashoka emblem must be booked under the PSA (J&K Public Safety Act). ”",Omar Abdullah reiterates that J&K Waqf Board should not have placed a plaque inside the Hazratbal shrine.

Another letter in spotlight





Monday came with a massive shock for many, including US President Donald Trump , after Democrats in the House Oversight Committee released new Epstein files, including a 2003 birthday album. The album has caught the attention of many, as it includes a sexually suggestive letter purportedly signed by Trump for Jeffrey Epstein Epstein was a disgraced financier who died in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.First, the Wall Street Journal described the letter earlier this year. The letter, alleged to be signed by Trump, was unveiled as part of a 50th birthday compilation for Epstein. The letter includes short dialogue between Donald and Epstein and a hand-drawn outline of a curvaceous woman.""We have certain things in common,"" says Donald.Jeffrey responds, ""Yes, we do, come to think of it.""""Enigmas never age, have you noticed that?"" asks Donald.""As a matter of fact, it was clear to me the last time I saw you,"" says Jeffrey.""A pal is a wonderful thing. Happy Birthday -- and may every day be another wonderful secret,"" the note ends, followed by Trump's signature.US President Trump had denied authoring the letter to Epstein and drawing the outline of a curvaceous woman.""These are not my words, not the way I talk. Also, I don't draw pictures,"" the president had said. He had also sued The Wall Street Journal for $10 billion, calling its earlier reporting on the letter ""false, malicious, and defamatory.""White House officials echoed that defence in their latest. ""It's very clear President Trump did not draw this picture, and he did not sign it,"" press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement posted on X. Deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich shared images of Trump’s signature over the years, claiming the one on the letter does not match.Another letter from the birthday book has come into the light that mentions Trump. It includes a photo of Epstein holding an oversized $22,500 check, apparently signed by the real estate magnate.""Jeffrey showing early talents with money + women! Sells 'fully depreciated' [redacted name] to Donald Trump,"" reads the note.The committee published a copy of Trump's alleged letter to Epstein before the entire book was released. It prompted sharp reactions from Republicans.

Complaints from jail



High stakes







The first day of jury selection for the high-profile federal trial of Ryan Routh, who is accused of trying to assassinate US President Donald Trump at his West Palm Beach golf club last September, began on Monday with a chaotic start.Routh, the self-represented defendant, was wearing a grey suit and ankle shackles, questioned potential jurors about their views on the war in Gaza, whether the US should acquire Greenland, and even how they would react if they saw a turtle in the road.US district judge Aileen Cannon, presiding over the case, swiftly cut him off.""None of the questions on your list have any bearing whatsoever. They were off base, sir, and have no relevance to jury selection,"" Cannon said, warning Routh not to interrupt.Routh told the court that at least two of his potential witnesses had backed out. One, a former co-worker living in Costa Rica, was unwilling to appear because he ""likes his freedom and doesn't want to get arrested or deported."" Another was unavailable because of scheduled travel to Vietnam during the trial.Routh ultimately dropped both names from his witness list.Before adjourning the morning session, Routh tried to raise concerns about his jail conditions, saying he couldn't sleep and wanted to be moved to general population.Cannon again shut him down, reminding him the comment was ""not appropriate at this time.""Routh faces federal charges, including attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate, assaulting a federal officer, and multiple firearms violations. A conviction could put him behind bars for life.He has pleaded not guilty to all federal counts. The jury selection process is expected to seat 12 jurors and four alternates before opening arguments begin later this week.","Ryan Routh is accused of trying to assassinate US President Donald Trump.

WHY??? What is wrong with this guy, and the 5% in Polls Mayor. I want to help the people of Chicago, not hurt them.

A federal appeals court on Monday upheld an $83.3 million jury award against US President Donald Trump for defaming writer E Jean Carroll in 2019, after she accused him of a decades-old rape in a Manhattan department store.The ruling from the 2nd US circuit court of Appeals in Manhattan was unanimous and issued by a three-judge panel. ""We hold that the district court did not err in any of the challenged rulings and that the jury's duly rendered damages awards were reasonable in light of the extraordinary and egregious facts of this case,"" the court wrote, as quoted by AP.The panel also rejected Trump’s claim that a Supreme Court decision granting presidential immunity for official acts shielded him from liability in Carroll’s lawsuit.Of the total award, $65 million consisted of punitive damages, after the jury concluded that Trump acted with malice. Carroll’s lawyers had urged jurors to impose a large penalty to stop him from continuing attacks.Trump had assailed Carroll after she went public with her allegation, repeating his denials and criticisms on social media, at news conferences, and even during the trial.The appeals court decision follows another loss for Trump in December, when a different 2nd Circuit panel unanimously upheld a $5 million civil verdict in Carroll’s favor.

Navy guard returned for watch, found man missing





MUMBAI: An unidentified man in naval uniform walked into Navy Nagar, the Navy's residential area in Colaba where entry is restricted, convinced a junior sailor on sentry duty that he was sent to relieve him of his charge, and fled with an INSAS rifle and two magazines loaded with 40 live cartridges last Saturday.The security breach sparked concerns about protocols in the military area. Cuffe Parade police filed an FIR for theft and multiple agencies, including NIA and ATS, have joined the probe. The Navy said an extensive search, in coordination with police, is on to recover the items and a board of inquiry has been ordered to probe the circumstances that led to the theft.Sources said the trespasser approached the Navy guard around 7.30pm on Saturday, claiming that he was taking over from him for the next shift. Believing the stranger to be his replacement, he handed over his service weapon and magazines before leaving for his hostel.An hour later, he realised he had left his watch behind and returned to the tower to collect it but found that the man had disappeared. Alarmed, he began searching the area for the impersonator. After nearly three hours of futile attempts, he reported the matter to his superiors, said sources.A team from the Navy immediately launched a search operation in and around the vicinity but failed to find any trace of the suspect.Navy officials later approached Cuffe Parade police and lodged a formal complaint. The ease with which the guard was hoodwinked into handing over his weapon has left both the Navy and security agencies embarrassed.A senior police officer said investigators are examining CCTV footage from the area to trace the suspect’s movements. Officials are probing whether he had prior knowledge of duty timings or was simply able to exploit procedural loopholes. Investigators have prepared a sketch of the suspect based on the description provided by the junior sailor.","Navy guard returned for watch, found man missing.

Salt trucks were not deployed to block Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Chicago's administration said on Monday, countering viral social media videos suggesting otherwise.The city said the trucks were in place “to support public safety efforts related to a planned protest and the Taste of Chicago,” calling it a “routine practice,” as quoted by NBC.The weekend saw thousands of people protest in Chicago against potential ICE activity and the possible deployment of the National Guard. Videos showed fleets of salt trucks in Chicago, with some social media posts claiming they were being used to block ICE and federal immigration enforcement.US president Donald Trump posted an AI-generated image on Truth Social showing himself in front of the Chicago skyline with helicopters and flames, captioned with references to “Apocalypse now” and deportations. He also referenced his recent executive order to rebrand the defence department as the Department of War.The post drew strong criticism from Democratic leaders. Governor Pritzker called it a threat against an American city.Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson also condemned the remarks, saying the president was attempting to undermine the constitution.On Sunday, Trump downplayed his post, saying, “We’re not going to war. We’re going to clean up our cities… That’s not war. That’s common sense.”An aide to Illinois Governor J B Pritzker said there were reports of some federal law enforcement arrests, but no evidence of a major surge in immigration enforcement.

Beyond the birthday book







The House Oversight Committee on Monday night released a new batch of documents tied to Jeffrey Epstein, including pages from the financier’s notorious “birthday book” that appear to contain a handwritten note from former US President Bill Clinton.The surprise document dump, led by the GOP-controlled panel, came just hours after Epstein’s estate turned over materials in response to a congressional subpoena.One entry in the book — compiled for Epstein’s 50th birthday by longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell — appears to be signed by Clinton. It praises Epstein’s “childlike curiosity, the drive to make a difference, and the [illegible] of friends.”Clinton and Epstein were known to have maintained a cordial relationship, with the former president flying on Epstein’s private jet multiple times. Clinton has not been accused of wrongdoing.The book also contains entries attributed to Donald Trump and former Epstein lawyer Alan Dershowitz. But White House has rejected the authenticity of the alleged Trump note, which features a suggestive drawing.“It’s very clear President Trump did not draw this picture, and he did not sign it,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote on X. She added that Trump’s legal team would “continue to aggressively pursue litigation” over earlier reporting on the book.House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., also sought to tamp down speculation, telling reporters: “I’m told that it’s fake.”One entry under Dershowitz’s name jokingly claimed to have persuaded Vanity Fair to shift the focus of an article from Epstein to Clinton. Dershowitz has consistently denied wrongdoing linked to Epstein.Another page in the book shows a cartoon of a man at a bar with the caption: “I’ve come to the conclusion that I should be thinking less about money and more about naked women, and biomathematical research.”Additional entries include a tongue-in-cheek note suggesting Epstein might have worked for the CIA, and a childhood photo captioned with the line: “Are you sure this will make my ‘winkie’ grow?”The latest tranche also contained Epstein’s last will and testament, his contact book, and details of his controversial 2007–2008 non-prosecution agreement with federal prosecutors in Florida.",The House Oversight Committee released new documents tied to financier Jeffrey Epstein.

Community reeling, political tensions rising







US President Donald Trump on Monday condemned the killing of a 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee in North Carolina, calling the suspect a ""career criminal.""In a statement posted on the official White House account on X, Trump said he had watched the surveillance video of the August 22 attack, describing it as ""horrific"" and ""not really watchable because it's so horrible. """"The perpetrator was a well-known career criminal, who had been previously arrested and released on CASHLESS BAIL in January, a total of 14 TIMES,"" Trump wrote. ""What the hell was he doing riding the train, and walking the streets? Criminals like this need to be LOCKED UP.""The victim, identified as Iryna Zarutska, had fled the war in Ukraine and was working in Charlotte. Video released by the Charlotte Area Transit System (CATS) shows her boarding a Lynx Blue Line train shortly before 10 pm, dressed in a pizzeria uniform and scrolling on her phone. Moments later, a man in a red hoodie seated behind her pulled out a knife and stabbed her three times, including once in the neck. Zarutska died at the scene.The suspect, 34-year-old Decarlos Brown, was arrested soon after the attack and charged with first-degree murder. Authorities said Brown had an extensive criminal record, including felony robbery, larceny, and breaking convictions dating back more than a decade.Speaking earlier in the day at Washington's Museum of the Bible, Trump said the Charlotte stabbing underscored the danger of lenient bail laws.""We're all people of religion, but there are evil people,"" Trump told the audience. ""If we don't handle that, we don't have a country.""He linked the case to his administration's earlier push against cashless bail policies, arguing that Brown's release showed ""why reform has failed.""Zarutska's killing has rattled Charlotte's Ukrainian community and fueled political debate nationwide. Trump cited other recent high-profile killings in his remarks, suggesting a broader pattern of ""criminals set free at the expense of innocent lives.""For Zarutska's grieving family, Trump said his message was one of condolence: ""I just give my love and hope to the family of the young woman who was stabbed … by a madman.""","US President Donald Trump condemned the killing of a 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee in North Carolina.

Members of the royal family marked the third anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II’s death on Monday, with Prince William and Prince Harry paying their respects separately despite being only miles apart.Queen Elizabeth, Britain’s longest-serving monarch, died aged 96 on September 8, 2022, at Balmoral Castle in Scotland after a reign of 70 years.To honour her memory, Prince William and his wife Kate visited a local Women’s Institute branch near their home in Windsor. The late queen had been a member of the WI for 80 years and served as president of the Sandringham branch until her death, according to Reuters.Prince Harry, who arrived from California, visited St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle, where he laid flowers at the queen’s resting place beside her husband, Prince Philip. Although Windsor is less than 10 miles from where William and Kate were, Harry was not expected to meet his brother during this visit. Reports suggest he could see his father, King Charles, for the first time in nearly two years.King Charles and Queen Camilla are currently at Balmoral, where they attended a church service at Crathie Kirk on Sunday. The service included prayers for Accession Day and for the Duchess of Kent, who passed away last week. The king has no public events planned to mark the anniversary.The royal family’s official X account shared a photograph of Queen Elizabeth with the message, “Remembering Queen Elizabeth II, 1926-2022.”","Prince William and his wife Kate visited a local Women's Institute branch near their home in Windsor.

Bullet Train Diplomacy: Modi’s Shinkansen Ride with Japan PM Signals India’s High-Speed Rail Future

Poll Do you agree with Prime Minister Ishiba's decision to resign? Yes, it was necessary. No, he should have stayed.





Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced Sunday he will step down, amid mounting pressure from within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to take responsibility for July’s upper house election defeat.""I have decided to resign from the position of president of the Liberal Democratic Party,"" said Ishiba, referring to Japan’s long-dominant ruling party, which has held power almost continuously for decades, as quoted by AP.Earlier reports from NHK stated that Ishiba chose to step down to prevent a split within the party, while the Asahi Shimbun said he could no longer withstand the growing calls for his resignation.Ishiba, who took office in October, had resisted demands from mostly right-wing opponents within his party for more than a month. His resignation comes just one day before the LDP was due to decide whether to hold an early leadership election — a move widely seen as a no-confidence vote against him if approved.The prime minister said he would begin the process of organizing a leadership contest to choose his successor, adding there was no need for Monday’s scheduled decision.The resignation follows July’s setback, when the LDP-Komeito coalition lost its upper house majority, dropping from 141 to 122 seats in the 248-member chamber. While less powerful than the lower house, the upper house remains critical for passing legislation.The 68-year-old, a self-confessed defence ""geek,"" has led the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) for less than a year — a position he secured only on his fifth attempt.His decision to step down marks a swift and bruising downfall for Ishiba, the son of a regional governor and a member of Japan’s small Christian minority. It also brings fresh turbulence to the LDP, which has governed Japan almost without interruption since 1955.Seen as a safe pair of hands, Ishiba won the party leadership in September 2024, becoming the LDP’s 10th prime minister since 2000 — all of them men. At the time, he pledged to ""create a new Japan,"" promising to revitalise depressed rural areas and address the ""quiet emergency"" of the country’s shrinking population.Soon after, he called snap lower house elections in October 2024, but the gamble backfired badly. The LDP suffered its worst result in 15 years, losing its majority with coalition partner Komeito and leaving the government dependent on opposition support to pass legislation.The July upper house elections deepened the crisis, stripping the coalition of its majority there as well and intensifying speculation about Ishiba’s resignation.During his brief tenure, his government’s approval ratings plunged, with voters angered by rising prices — especially rice, which has doubled in cost over the past year.","Ishiba, who took office in October, had resisted demands from mostly right-wing opponents within his party for more than a month.

Trump Struggles At White House Dinner, Melania Steps In As Health Fears Explode





US president Donald Trump drew criticism on Monday after suggesting that some cases of domestic violence were “lesser” crimes and should not be counted in crime statistics.Speaking at an event, Trump accused his opponents of exaggerating crime figures to damage his record. He said, “Much lesser things, things that take place in the home, they call crime. If a man has a little fight with the wife, they say this was a crime,” drawing laughter from parts of the audience.The remarks were condemned by women’s rights groups and political leaders. The national organisation for women (NOW) said Trump was “blind to the domestic violence crisis in America.” Its president, Kim Villanueva, said, “Donald Trump showed us again what’s in his heart when he called domestic violence a ‘lesser crime.’”Arizona’s Democratic attorney general, Kris Mayes, also responded on X, writing, “Yes, Mr president, domestic violence is a crime.”Data from the US centers for disease control and prevention shows that around 41 percent of women and 26 percent of men in the country face sexual violence, physical violence, or stalking from an intimate partner during their lifetime.",US president Donald Trump drew criticism on Monday after suggesting that some cases of domestic violence were “lesser” crimes.

SEOUL: In a first, dozens of South Korean women who worked as prostitutes have filed a suit accusing the US military of illegally promoting the sex trade for decades and locking them up to forcibly treat them for sexually transmitted diseases.In the lawsuit, announced in a news conference Monday, the women demanded that the US military apologise and pay damages for playing a hand in managing a vast network of prostitution around its bases in South Korea. Korean women who worked in bars and brothels frequented by US troops have reported rampant human rights violations.In 2022, the women won a court ruling against their own govt. South Korea's Supreme Court ordered govt to compensate dozens of women for the trauma they endured as ""comfort women for the US military,"" as they were once known. The court found govt guilty of encouraging prostitution for American GIs to help bring in badly needed US dollars for the economy and maintain ties with the US, on which it relied for security. It also said govt forced many women to get treated for sexually transmitted diseases in a ""systematic and violent"" way.The latest lawsuit, which was filed at a Seoul court on Friday, was the first attempt by the women to hold the US military accountable.The women and their lawyers said the US military was ""the real culprit"" in what was a state-sponsored sex trade, even allowing comfort women inside its bases and near its field training grounds.On Monday, a 66-year-old woman said she was 16 when she was sold to a pimp. She said the US military was aware that minors were brought into the trade through sex trafficking but did nothing to stop it.In South Korea, women like her have not won the kind of public sympathy extended to women forced into sexual slavery for Japanese soldiers during World War II. Instead, they said they have had to live in shame for decades. Korean society despised them, they said, treating them like a shameful underside of its alliance with the US that it wanted to obscure. They could not even sue the US military directly; lawsuits seeking compensation from the US troops based in South Korea must be settled with the local govt. So the women sued govt again.Their goal is to find the US military culpable in law. The US has stationed troops in South Korea since the 1950-53 Korean War. Some of the women working in camp towns had been abducted and sold to pimps, while others were lured with the promise of work. All the women were held in debt bondage to pimps, according to scholars who studied the issue.

Trump learns of stabbing during press



The fatal attack







US President Donald Trump on Tuesday lashed out after the fatal stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska on a Charlotte light rail train, blaming Democrats for the tragedy.“I have seen the horrific video of a beautiful, young Ukrainian refugee, who came to America to escape the vicious War in Ukraine, and was innocently riding the Metro in Charlotte, North Carolina, where she was brutally ambushed by a mentally deranged lunatic,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.Blaming Democrats, Trump said, “The blood of this innocent woman can literally be seen dripping from the killer’s knife, and now her blood is on the hands of the Democrats who refuse to put bad people in jail.”Trump further used this as an opportunity to promote his preferred candidate in North Carolina’s 2026 Senate race. “VOTE FOR MICHAEL WHATLEY FOR UNITED STATES SENATE, HE WON’T LET THIS HAPPEN AGAIN!” he said.His comments came after a reporter asked him about the stabbing on Sunday. At the time, Trump said he was unaware of the incident. “Horrible,” he responded, before asking, “No, I haven’t heard. When did this happen?” He later added, “I’ll know all about it by tomorrow morning.”A chilling video circulating on social media showed 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska riding a Charlotte light rail train moments before the fatal attack.Footage released by police captured Zarutska scrolling on her phone when 35-year-old Decarlos Brown Jr suddenly pulled out a pocket knife and stabbed her multiple times.After the assault, Brown was seen wandering through the Lynx Blue Line train, carrying the weapon as blood pooled on the floor. Passengers began to notice the trail of blood while the suspect removed his hoodie and waited to exit at the next stop.","US President Donald Trump lashed out after the fatal stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska on a Charlotte light rail train.

‘Went Into Massage Room & Jeffrey…’: Epstein Survivors Recount Horror | Watch





Democratic lawmakers on the US house oversight committee on Monday published a lewd note allegedly written by Donald Trump to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003- a release the White House quickly denounced as “fake news.”The message was released on the official account of The Democrat's X account as part of the committee’s probe into how authorities handled Epstein’s criminal investigation.The note appears on the outline of a nude woman and was allegedly included in a book of letters from Epstein’s friends, compiled by Ghislaine Maxwell for his fiftieth birthday.It contains a short dialogue between “Donald” and “Jeffrey,” ending with the line, “A pal is a wonderful thing. Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret.” Trump’s signature appears on the sketch.The White House quickly pushed back. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, ""The latest piece published by the Wall Street Journal PROVES this entire “Birthday Card” story is false. As I have said all along, it’s very clear President Trump did not draw this picture, and he did not sign it.""""This is FAKE NEWS to perpetuate the Democrat Epstein Hoax!"" she added.Trump has repeatedly denied ever sending the message. He even filed a $10 billion lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal after it first reported on the note, insisting that he had never written it.Epstein, a wealthy financier with powerful global connections, was found dead in his New York jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial for alleged sex trafficking of underage girls recruited to provide him with sexual massages.Trump’s supporters have long claimed that “deep state” elites in the Democratic Party and Hollywood were being shielded from scrutiny in the Epstein case. But many were outraged when the FBI and Justice Department concluded in July that Epstein had died by suicide, had no client list, and did not blackmail prominent figures.","Democratic lawmakers on the US house oversight committee on Monday published a lewd note allegedly written by Donald Trump to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003.

The bodycam footage of the interaction recently went viral.





A video of an Indian-origin woman, Yogini Varma, a New Jersey resident, being interrogated by the police on allegations of stealing designer goods, a diamond bracelet from Short Hills Mall, went viral as a YouTube channel released the bodycam footage recently. The incident, however, took place on January 1, 2025, reports said. The YouTube channel took down the video, though clips of it are being widely circulated.Verma was arrested and charged with shoplifting and possession of stolen goods. She was later released pending a court appearance.The woman was in a Tesla coming out of the parking of the mall when the police stopped her. She was asked whether she took something from the mall without paying. Varma denied and said the cops could check her. She was asked specifically whether she took a diamond bracelet from the mall. To this, she said she picked one but kept it right there from where she took it, or it might have slipped.Eventually, the bracelet was seen around her wrist and she apologized for taking it by mistake. After Varma was handcuffed, officers asked her if she had anything else on her. She said she had something in her car that she had to return to the mall.A search of Varma's car revealed that she had shopping bags from Anthropologie, Macy’s, Nordstrom, and J.Crew containing expensive clothes, many still with labels and security tags attached and there were no receipts.“You could say that they are stolen too, I don’t know what to say at this point,"" she said when she grew flustered.Recently, several such incidents where Indian-origin women were caught shoplifting in US stores came to the surface. In July, a woman attempted to steal goods worth over $1300 from a Target store in Illinois. While she was being interrogated, she said she was ready to pay for the things she stole. Another similar incident took place much earlier at another Target store on January 15, where a woman was seen gasping for breath as she was being interrogated.","Yogini Varma was caught shoplifting in New Jersey earlier this year.

Aleema Khan, sister of Pakistan 's jailed former prime minister Imran Khan , was attacked with an egg while addressing reporters outside Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail on Friday.A video of the episode has gone viral on social media, showing the egg hitting Aleema as she spoke to the media.Supporters of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party quickly apprehended two women accused of throwing the eggs and handed them over to police, news agency PTI reported.Rawalpindi police said the arrested women were PTI party supporters who had travelled with members of the All-Government Employees Grand Alliance to protest against unmet demands.The statement added that the egg was thrown after Aleema did not respond to questions from the two women. Both were later taken into custody and moved to the Adiala checkpoint.PTI condemned the act as “shameful,” alleging the women were planted for political motives and accusing police of helping them escape in a car. “The women were sent to Aleema's media talk as part of an agenda,” the party said.Leaders across the political spectrum criticized the attack.Balochistan National Party-Mengal chief Akhtar Mengal condemned the act, calling it “the lowest form of politics.”He said, “Even in enmity, a woman deserves dignity. Targeting women is the lowest form of politics, and this cheap stunt must be condemned in the strongest words.”Federal minister for development Ahsan Iqbal said, “Politics must remain a contest of ideas, not of violence or hatred. We should all work to keep it healthy and respectful.”Meanwhile, PML-N leader Khawaja Saad Rafique described the incident as “shameful, vile and crude.”Imran Khan has been in prison for more than two years facing multiple charges. In January 2025, a Pakistani tribunal sentenced the former prime minister to 14 years in prison, while his wife, Bushra Bibi, received a seven-year sentence in connection with a corruption case involving land graft.The allegations centred on the acceptance of land from a property magnate in exchange for facilitating money laundering during Khan’s tenure as prime minister.Prior to this verdict, Khan had received three separate convictions related to corruption, disclosure of state secrets, and violations of marriage laws, carrying sentences of 10, 14 and seven years respectively.","Aleema Khan was attacked with an egg while addressing reporters outside Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail on Friday.

A relatively unknown militant group, Ittihad-ul-Mujahideen (IuM) Pakistan, has claimed responsibility for the suicide car bomb attack on the Federal Constabulary Corps in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Bannu division on Tuesday.The outfit claimed the attack, which involved a car rigged with IED, killed more than two dozen members of the Frontier Corps but Pakistan acknowledged only six fatalities. Predictably, it blamed India for the attack. Pakistan claimed to have neutralised five operatives in a 12-hour counter operation but the group asserted that its 'fidayeen' blew themselves up after carrying out the attack. One of the suicide bombers was identified by the group as Abdul Aziz alias Qassid Mohajir, a resident of Afghanistan's Paktika province.The Pakistan army camp suffered massive destruction in the suicide attack. Pakistan military's ISPR played down the incident, the latest in a series of attacks on Pakistani military personnel. ""During early hours of Sept 2, Indian proxy 'Fitna al Khwarij' targeted the Federal Constabulary Headquarters in Bannu district. The Indian-sponsored Kharjis attempted to breach the perimeter security, however, their nefarious designs were swiftly foiled by vigilant and resolute response.In their desperation, the Kahrjis rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into the perimeter wall. The suicide blast resulted in the partial collapse of the perimeter wall and damage to adjacent civilian infrastructure, inflicting injuries to three innocent civilians,"" ISPR said.IuM Pakistan, active since April, comprises fighters from outfits like Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group, Lashkar-e-Islam and Jamaat-Ul-Ahrar.
