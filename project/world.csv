Poll Would you support initiatives to improve rescue operations in avalanche-prone areas? Yes, definitely. Maybe, but it depends on the cost.

NEW DELHI: Three army personnel lost their lives after an avalanche hit a base camp in the Siachen sector of Ladakh, officials told news agency PTI, on Tuesday.The avalanche struck the Siachen base camp area, located at an altitude of 12,000 feet, on Sunday. Three soldiers, including two Agniveers, were trapped under the snow. A rescue operation was swiftly launched, and the bodies of all three personnel were recovered, they added.The location remains one of the world’s highest and most challenging military deployments. Located on high atitude, the Siachen Glacier is known for extreme weather conditions and frequent snow-related incidents. The army has suffered several casualties over the years due to avalanches and frostbite.The army maintains a continuous presence in the region to secure strategic positions near the line of control. Troops posted at these altitudes undergo specialised high-altitude warfare training and are equipped for survival in sub-zero temperatures.","The avalanche struck the Siachen base camp area, located at an altitude of 12,000 feet.

PM Modi appeals for peace as India treads cautiously on Nepal crisis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-appeals-for-peace-as-india-treads-cautiously-on-nepal-crisis/articleshow/123791987.cms,"PM Narendra Modi (ANI)

'Nepotism, Corruption And...': Ex-Envoys Decode What Fuelled Nepal’s Violent Gen Z Protests

As Nepal plunged into a crisis, PM Narendra Modi chaired a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) to discuss the developments in the country, saying the violence witnessed there was heart-rending.Modi said he was anguished that many young people had lost their lives and appealed to all “brothers and sisters” in Nepal to support peace. “The stability, peace and prosperity of Nepal are of utmost importance to us,” he said.Earlier in the day, India’s response to the Gen Z uprising in Nepal, which devoured PM K P Sharma Oli, was restrained expectedly as the government - in a statement Tuesday morning - said it was closely monitoring the situation and urged all concerned to exercise restraint and resolve issues through peaceful means. After news of Oli’s resignation, the government issued an advisory asking Indian nationals in Nepal to shelter in their homes, follow local safety advisories and Indians here to defer travel to Nepal.In its morning statement, the first official response to developments in Nepal, the Indian government also said it was deeply saddened by the loss of many young lives and expressed condolences to the families of the victims.Unlike the statement jointly issued by several European countries, India stopped short of seeking protection of fundamental rights but its response was still an acknowledgement of the organic nature of the protests on Monday in which 19 lives were lost. Oli had claimed that “certain elements” had infiltrated the protests.India will have few tears to shed for Oli, not least because of his continued courtship of China. In July last year, Oli junked alliance with fellow Communist leader P K Dahal Prachanda to enter into a power-sharing agreement with pro-India party Nepali Congress (NC), himself taking oath as PM for the 4th time. In a break from the past, however, Oli chose China for his first bilateral visit.This meant the Indian government had to take a rain check on Oli’s proposed visit to India. Oli was finally scheduled to come mid-September but even this was derailed by Nepal’s public outburst on the border issue which was provoked by India’s decision to reopen trade with China through the Lipulekh pass that is claimed by Nepal. India did not want Oli’s visit hijacked by Nepal’s border claims, which it sees as not based on historical facts and evidence.However, India might have to contend with a different type of instability in Nepal as it’s not just Oli but all mainstream leaders and parties that are under attack. The protests were triggered by a ban on social media but quickly turned into an insurrection, fuelled not just by anger against Oli or his government but also deep-seated resentment among the Gen Z about the recurring political game of musical chairs, which has seen the same leaders take turns to rule the country, rent-seeking politicians and rampant corruption.Former Indian ambassador to Nepal Manjeev Puri says that while the present crisis was precipitated by the mishandling of protests by local authorities for which the buck had to stop at the top, the increasingly aspirational Nepal youth has genuine reasons to feel disgruntled about the political situation in Nepal. He also says the ban on social media was avoidable at a time of increasing Nepal exposure to globalisation.Unlike in the case of Bangladesh, where it fell victim to its ties with the leader, India can perhaps hope to safely allow the churn to play out in Nepal while remaining focused on the cooperative ties across diverse sectors that have yielded benefits for the people of both the countries. Oli was not India’s man, after all. In the meantime, as Puri says, India can counsel the leaders about the need for political sagacity and for being empathetic towards the people of Nepal.",PM Narendra Modi chaired a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) to discuss the developments in the country.

This declaration from Imphal Hmar Displaced People Committee captures the defiance of Kuki-Zo groups who said they will boycott events tied to PM Narendra Modi's likely Sept 13 visit to Manipur.Preparations are underway in Imphal and Churachandpur, though PMO is yet to confirm his itinerary. Displaced people's associations, including Eastern Vaiphei IDPs Welfare Committee & Chandel District IDP Welfare Committee, echoed Hmar committee's stand, signalling that Modi's arrival will 'meet a wall of grief' rather than celebration.Ethnic violence that broke out in May 2023 has killed more than 260 people, displaced over 60,000 and burned hundreds of villages, hardening divides between Kuki-Zo tribes in the hills and Meiteis in Imphal valley. Relief camps still house thousands.Apex tribal union Kuki Inpi Manipur (KIM) said Modi ""should be welcomed upon his visit"" but stressed it must become a platform ""to press for justice and recognition of Kuki-Zo people's collective aspirations"". Its demand: a political solution addressing root causes of the conflict. ""Temporary relief measures cannot substitute for a lasting settlement,"" KIM said.The group also hit back at the Sept 4 suspension of operations (SoO) extension signed by two Kuki armed groups, Centre and state, which included a clause affirming Manipur's territorial integrity.KIM said the deal applies only to those armed groups, not the wider Kuki-Zo community. ""Separation from Meiteis has been a lived reality since May 3, 2023,"" it said, adding SoO groups had already told MHA the chapter on ""Manipur integrity"" was closed. ""Kuki-Zo people do not recognise or uphold the idea of Manipur territorial integrity in any form,"" KIM said.Secrecy over PM's itinerary has sharpened tensions. Naga groups have launched a trade embargo, Meitei organisations are pushing back against peace overtures, and Manipur remains under President's rule since Feb. Observers said Modi's visit, if it goes ahead, will happen in a landscape of ethnic fragmentation and competing demands for autonomy. His engagement - who he meets, what he announces, and whether he acknowledges the fractured realities - could potentially set the course of peace and governance for years.","Kuki-Zo groups say they will boycott events tied to PM Narendra Modi's likely Sept 13 visit to Manipur.

"Assam Cabinet approves SOP to detect, deport 'illegals' in 10 days",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/assam-cabinet-approves-sop-to-detect-deport-illegals-in-10-days/articleshow/123797628.cms,"GUWAHATI: Assam Cabinet approved on Tuesday a new standard operating procedure empowering district commissioners and senior superintendents of police to identify and expel illegal immigrants within 10 days, sidestepping the long route through the Foreigners' Tribunals.Illegal immigrants detected within 12 hours of crossing into Assam, or found near zero line along the border, will be pushed back immediately, the SOP mandates. If proof of Indian citizenship is not furnished within 10 days, the DC must issue an expulsion order, giving the person 24 hours to exit through a designated route.CM Himanta Biswa Sarma said the overhaul was necessary to unclog Assam's burdened tribunal system. ""The current route through Foreigners' Tribunals till conclusion is a long one, which may stretch to the HC and SC. There are 82,000 pending cases in our tribunals. This Cabinet decision bypasses the tribunal system for the first time,"" he said.The move marks a sweeping shift in how Assam tackles illegal immigration, particularly from Bangladesh. Bangladeshi Muslims have long been at the heart of the state's demographic anxieties and were central to the anti-foreigner agitation of the 1980s, a movement that reshaped the state's politics and culminated in the Assam Accord of 1985.The new framework draws authority from the Immigrants (Expulsion from Assam) Act, 1950, a law enacted specifically for the state but largely overshadowed by later Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunal) Act.IM(DT) Act was enforced only in Assam from Oct 15, 1983. Other states continued under the Foreigners Act, 1946. Supreme Court struck it down as ultra vires in 2005 after a petition filed by then students' leader and current Union minister Sarbananda Sonowal.SC called it discriminatory and violative of Art 14 on equality and Art 355, which obliges Centre to shield states from external aggression and disturbance. The law made detection and deportation of illegal immigrants cumbersome with stiff procedural barriers. Unlike Foreigners Act, where suspects must prove citizenship, IM(DT) shifted the burden onto state, weakening enforcement.Post-IMDT, Assam defaulted to tribunals until a constitutional bench last Oct ruled the 1950 Act ""shall be effectively employed for the purpose of identification of illegal immigrants"". The 1950 Act empowers Union govt to order the removal of any person or class of people entering Assam from outside India, if their stay is deemed detrimental to public interest or to the rights of scheduled tribes in the state.The SOP says only when officials cannot make a prima facie call will a suspected immigrant's case be sent to a tribunal. People already declared foreign nationals by tribunals, having exhausted all appeals, will face immediate expulsion without further verification.Under the new system, once a suspect is flagged, SSP must capture biometric and demographic data on Foreigners Identification Portal. If an expulsion order is ignored, the person will be placed in a holding centre or handed to BSF.","Assam Cabinet approves a new standard operating procedure empowering district commissioners and senior superintendents of police.

PM Modi Responds To Donald Trump’s 'Will Always Be Friends' Remark, Says India-US Ties Remain Strong

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he looks forward to speak with his ""very good friend"" Prime Minister Modi in the coming weeks and confirmed that his administration will continue negotiations with India to resolve trade barriers between the two countries.Sharing a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote, ""I am pleased to announce that India, and the United States of America, are continuing negotiations to address the Trade Barriers between our two Nations. I look forward to speaking with my very good friend, Prime Minister Modi, in the upcoming weeks.""""I feel certain that there will be no difficulty in coming to a successful conclusion for both of our Great Countries!"" he added.The remarks come after Trump had earlier softened his tone on India-US relations, calling the ties ""very special,"" affirming his friendship with PM Modi on Friday.Earlier, speaking at the White House Trump had said that, ""I always will. I'll always be friends with (PM) Modi. He's a great Prime Minister. I'll always be friends, but I just don't like what he is doing at this particular moment.""""But India and the United States have a very special relationship.There is nothing to worry about. We just have moments on occasion,"" he added.Following Trump’s statement, PM Modi responded warmly on Saturday, saying he ""deeply appreciates and fully reciprocates President Trump's sentiments and positive assessment of our ties.""However, Trump's Trade adviser Peter Navarro on Monday renewed his attack on India and warned that it ""won't end well"" if New Delhi doesn't ""come around"" at some point in trade negotiations with the United States.In his interview with 'Real America Voice', Navarro reiterated that India is ""Maharaja"" of tariffs.""But it's absolutely true. They have the highest tariffs in any major country in the world against the United States. We got to deal with that,"" Navarro said.""I think India must come around at some point. And if it doesn't, it's lying down with Russia and China, and that won't end well for India,"" he added.Navarro has repeatedly attacked India in the past few weeks for ""profiteering"" from Russian crude by reselling its refined form in the international market.The shift in Trump's tone comes after his administration’s imposed 25% tariffs on Indian goods, plus an additional 25% on India’s Russian oil imports, bringing total duties to 50%.","US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he looks forward to speaking with his ""very good friend"" Prime Minister Modi.

""Giving sweeping discretionary powers to a governor will result in a dyarchy,"" Subramanium said.Any conferment of veto power to a governor is antithetical to the existence of the elected state legislature,"" Gopal Subramanium, appearing for Karnataka, said, adding he is always, like the President, bound by the aid and advice of the council of ministers.He, however, conceded that a governor can act without the aid and advice of the council of ministers in matters related to grant of sanction for prosecution of ministers under the Prevention of Corruption Act; while acting as chancellor of universities (an argument which would not go well with West Bengal which is at loggerheads with the governor on appointment of vice-chancellors); and as head of religious boards.The power to withhold assent is concomitant to returning it to the legislature for reconsideration, and if the legislature passes the bill again, with or without amendments, the governor has no option but to grant assent, he said.Subramanium said timelines for governors and the President for taking decision on bills is a necessity in the present political situation and argued that SC by providing timelines in the Tamil Nadu case in its April 8 judgment has only facilitated the aggrieved states to approach the court in the event of them not taking a decision on bills within specified time.The bench, also comprising and Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar, appreciated Subramanium's sincerity in the court hearing and the courtesy he extended to the counsel opposed to him, and told him to keep assisting courts in the future.For Punjab, senior advocate Arvind Datar argued that a state legislature is entitled to enact a law that may be perceived as unconstitutional, especially in providing reservation in jobs to certain communities which would take the total quota beyond the 50% cap, but the governor or President have no option but to assent to it.""Governor has no power to determine the constitutional validity of a bill, which is the task of constitutional courts. Discretionary power does not mean a governor can keep reserving bills for President's consideration. Moreover, the President, bound by the aid and advice of the Union council of ministers, cannot frustrate the will of the people of the state by sitting over a bill referred to her by the governor,"" he said.Attempts by senior advocate P Wilson to argue for DMK were scotched by the CJI-headed bench, which said that Tamil Nadu has already argued in detail against the Presidential Reference and that giving a chance to a political party to argue would be an invite to other political parties to intervene. The arguments would continue on Wednesday.","Opposition-governed states of Karnataka, Punjab, Kerala and Telangana say Constitution confers no discretion on President and governors to stall a bill passed by legislature.

Police are trying to piece together how the gunshots were fired and what led to the shooting as the two students were considered ""inseparable"" by friends.The incident occurred around 10.30am at RCI Vidya Vihar hostel in Knowledge Park-III. The two students - Deepak Kumar (22) from Andhra Pradesh and Devansh Chauhan (23) from Agra - were both enrolled in the PGDM programme at Birla Institute of Management Technology (Bimtech). They were, however, not roommates. It was in Kumar's room where the shots were fired. Chauhan is in Kailash hospital.

Nepal is witnessing its most turbulent political crisis in years after Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli resigned on Tuesday, a day after violent student-led protests left 19 people dead and forced the government to revoke a controversial social media ban.The unrest has now turned into a wider movement against corruption and political elites, shaking the foundations of the Himalayan nation’s fragile democracy.Oli, 72, announced his resignation on Tuesday afternoon, saying he was “deeply saddened” by the loss of lives but blamed “vested interest groups” for infiltrating peaceful demonstrations. His statement offered compensation to victims’ families and free treatment for the injured, but it failed to stem public anger.Also read: Nepal violence; Ex-PM Khanal’s wife dies after protesters torch house - president urges calm, dialogue Home minister Ramesh Lekhak and agriculture minister Ramnath Adhikari resigned earlier, taking “moral responsibility” for Monday’s bloodshed.By Tuesday, protesters had stormed and set fire to the parliament building, Oli’s residence in Balkot, and homes of several senior leaders including President Ram Chandra Poudel, former PM Sher Bahadur Deuba, Maoist leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal, and foreign minister Arzu Rana Deuba.Even party headquarters of the ruling CPN-UML and Nepali Congress were attacked.Oli’s exit leaves Nepal in political flux. The 275-member House requires 138 seats for a majority:The opposition Nepali Congress and Maoist Centre could stake a claim, but internal splits, including the Shekhar Koirala faction threatening to break ranks, complicate matters. The RSP, buoyed by youth support, could emerge as kingmakers.All eyes are now on Balendra Shah, Kathmandu’s independent mayor and rapper-turned-politician, who has become the face of the Gen Z movement. To many, he represents a break from traditional dynastic politics. His popularity has energised the RSP and independent candidates, raising speculation he could be pushed forward as a prime ministerial candidate.“Balen symbolises change,” said political analyst Dipak Gautam. “But running a city is very different from leading a fractured nation in crisis.”Nepal may see a caretaker government until parliament decides on a new coalition.With curfews in Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur, and the army deployed around parliament, instability threatens to deepen.Despite curfews, demonstrations continued Tuesday in Baneshwor, Kalanki and Lalitpur, with students chanting “Punish the murderers in government.”India’s embassy in Kathmandu has issued emergency contact numbers for Indian nationals in Nepal, reflecting growing regional concern. Both India and China, which vie for influence in Nepal, are watching closely as the crisis unfolds.The immediate trigger was the government’s decision last week to block Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, WhatsApp and X, demanding the platforms register and submit to local oversight. Authorities argued it was needed to curb “misuse” of social media, but activists saw it as an attack on free expression.On Monday, tens of thousands of mostly young demonstrators, many in school uniforms, flooded Kathmandu’s streets, chanting “Stop corruption, not social media!” The rallies soon turned violent after police opened fire, killing 19 and injuring over 300. Witnesses reported protesters shot in the head and chest, overwhelming hospitals in the capital.While the social media ban was the spark, underlying anger has been building for years. Many young Nepalis feel betrayed by politicians they see as corrupt, dynastic, and disconnected. The viral hashtag #NepoKids, targeting children of politicians flaunting luxury lifestyles online, has become a rallying cry.“This government killed our friends. We will not stop until they are punished,” said student protester Narayan Acharya. Another demonstrator, Durganah Dahal, said, “As long as these corrupt leaders are in power, the people will continue to suffer.”","Nepal is witnessing its most turbulent political crisis in years. Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli resigned on Tuesday, a day after violent student-led protests left 19 people dead and forced the government to revoke a controversial social media ban. The unrest has now turned into a wider movement against corruption and political elites.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123785372,imgsize-118312,width-400,resizemode-4/nepal-protest.jpg"

Nepal In Flames: PM KP Oli Resigns, Flees In Army Chopper As Gen Z Protesters Burn Down Parliament

Balen's message for Nepali youth





With Nepal Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli stepping down amid the deadly student-led “GenZ protests,” attention has shifted to Kathmandu’s young mayor, Balendra Shah, as online campaigns promote him as the Himalayan nation’s next leader.Popularly known as “Balen,” the 35-year-old is a rapper-turned-politician who has served as Kathmandu’s 15th mayor since May 2022. He won as an independent candidate, becoming the first to hold the post without party backing.An engineer by training, Balen holds a degree in civil engineering and has an India connection - he pursued structural engineering at Visvesvaraya Technological University in Karnataka. Before entering politics, he was active in Nepal’s underground hip-hop scene, using his music to highlight corruption and inequality.In June 2023, he drew national attention by banning the screening of Indian films in Kathmandu over a dialogue in the movie Adipurush.In a Facebook post, Shah on Tuesday appealed to protesters to exercise restraint, noting that their demand for the resignation of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and other ministers has already been met.He cautioned against further damage to public and private property, saying, “The loss of the country’s wealth is, in reality, a loss of our own property. It is now essential that we all act with restraint.”Shah’s appeal comes as nationwide “GenZ” protests intensify, with young demonstrators demanding accountability over corruption, restrictions on freedoms and police violence. A security forces crackdown has left at least 19 dead and more than 500 injured in clashes around the Federal Parliament and other parts of Kathmandu over the past two days.","Balendra Shah, 35, is a rapper-turned-politician who has served as Kathmandu’s 15th mayor since May 2022.

BENGALURU: What was meant to be a spiritual journey to the Himalayas turned into a nightmare for 38-year-old Rajani Maski and her husband Raghuveer Yavagal from Bengaluru.Maski, who travelled with a group of 130 devotees from Isha Foundation to Mansarovar, is now stranded at Kathmandu's Tribhuvan International Airport for over 24 hours, caught in the middle of Nepal's escalating political unrest.""We don't know what to do. The airport gates are shut, they won't let us out, and the military and police are pushing us back inside. There is no food, no water, and no shops open to even buy something to eat,"" she said in a distressed voice, speaking to TOI.Like her, there are scores of people from Karnataka, especially Bengaluru, stranded in Nepal, waiting for help to return home.Rajani and her husband were in Manasarovar, Nepal, for the past 10 days as part of a pilgrimage tour. ""About 130 people travelled from Bengaluru on Aug 24 to Manasarovar and returned to Kathmandu on Monday at 10.30pm. But instead of peace, we were welcomed by chaos on the streets.""Rajani said, ""We reached the hotel around 10.30pm. There was smoke everywhere, and wooden planks and tyres were burning. There weren't many people on the streets, but a sense of fear lingered in the air."" She and her husband left for the airport on Tuesday, hoping to catch a 1pm flight to Bengaluru.However, their hopes quickly vanished when they arrived at the terminal to find shuttered gates, cancelled flights, and heavy barricades.""It was frightening. Thankfully, the hotel staff helped us book a cab and ensured a driver dropped us safely at the airport. But things only worsened once we got inside,"" Rajani said. Inside the terminal, confusion reigned. Close to 500 to 1,000 passengers were packed into the airport, with nearly 200 from Karnataka alone, she claimed. Most travellers, like her, did not carry food or water, assuming they would be able to purchase something at the airport. But with shops shuttered and no supplies available, desperation grew. ""We are stuck in a closed room like prisoners. People are panicking, some are crying, and others are falling sick. There is only one charging point for everyone, which makes it even more difficult to stay connected with our families back home,"" she said.Several stranded passengers have been trying to book hotel rooms outside the airport, but the volatile situation in Kathmandu has made that uncertain.

ELURU: Vinay Purushottam, a first year MTech student at IIIT-Nuzvid in Andhra Pradesh, stabbed the examination coordinator, Professor S S V Gopala Raju, after he barred Vinay from taking practical examinations on Monday due to shortage in mandatory semester attendance.Police took Vinay into custody and are questioning him in this regard. Sources said the professor was admitted to a govt hospital and his condition is stable.K V V N V Prasad, DSP of Nuzvid, said Vinay completed his first semester, but has not been attending classes regularly. He is preparing for online examinations instead of attending classes. This led to a shortage of attendance and the IIIT management denied him permission to take examinations in the college, the DSP said.When Vinay requested the professor that he be allowed to take the practical examinations, Raju told him to speak to the head of the department, who also turned down his request as his attendance was less than 25% for the semester, the DSP said.Again, Vinay went back to Raju and insisted that he be permitted to take the exam, which the professor rejected again. Vinay then pulled out a knife and stabbed Raju thrice on his hand and head, the DSP said.Other students at the scene restrained Vinay and handed him over to security personnel. The DSP said Vinay earlier bought two knives in Vizag. Police are investigating whether Vinay attacked the professor in a fit of rage or had planned to attack him all along.Nara Lokesh, human resources development and IT minister, condemned the attack on Raju. Lokesh said no teacher wants to destroy the career of any student. He made it clear that violence and indiscipline among students would not be tolerated.","Vinay Purushottam, a first year MTech student at IIIT-Nuzvid in Andhra Pradesh, stabbed the examination coordinator, Professor S S V Gopala Raju.

Nepal Lifts Social Media Ban Following Deadly Protests

Experts on 'Gen Z protests'

Nepal's government has lifted its ban on major social media platforms, including Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube, Twitter and Instagram. This come after a violent crackdown on protests left at least 19 people dead. The unrest, which was sparked by the social media ban, saw a massive turnout of young demonstrators, often referred to as ""Gen Z."" The government's retreat on Tuesday morning, with all 26 blocked platforms coming back online, seems to be an attempt to quell the rising fury.Despite the government's concession, protesters returned to the streets, demanding accountability for the violence and the ouster of officials, including Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. The demonstrations, which are the most widespread in Nepal's recent history, are driven not only by the social media restrictions but also by deep-seated public anger over corruption, a weak economy, and growing economic inequality. Many Nepalese feel the government has failed to address these issues.The protests on Monday in the capital, Kathmandu, were met with an aggressive response from security forces. Witnesses reported that authorities used live ammunition, rubber bullets, and water cannons on the crowd, which was largely composed of young people. Local news sources reported that at least 400 people were injured, and hospitals were overwhelmed with casualties.The protests have been embraced by Nepal's youth, who are using the label ""Gen Z protest"" to highlight their involvement. A government official, Prithvi Subba Gurung, acknowledged this in a statement, saying that the ban would be lifted ""to address the demands raised by Gen Z.""The social media ban, which went into effect on September 4, targeted platforms that had not complied with new government registration requirements. The ban was especially disruptive because these platforms are essential for many Nepalese citizens who work abroad and for numerous local businesses.Experts suggest the youth-led movement has also been inspired by recent uprisings in countries like Indonesia and Bangladesh. The unrest has prompted international concern, with the United Nations calling for a ""prompt and transparent investigation"" into the use of force by security forces. Several embassies, including those of the U.S. and U.K., have also issued a joint statement supporting freedom of assembly and expression.","Nepal's government has lifted its ban on major social media platforms, including Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube, Twitter and Instagram.

Jessica Reed Kraus, a conservative influencer, has questioned the accounts of survivors of Jeffrey Epstein ’s sexual abuse.Kraus, who calls herself “independent media,” posted more than two dozen Instagram stories criticising the women for participating in flights to Epstein’s private island and suggested some of their stories were exaggerated.She also accused the survivors of being “propped up by liberal media” and called their recent press conference a “PR stunt.”“Forgive me, for refusing to embrace a narrative in which college aged women who boarded a private jet again and again (for years) to vacation & accept payments as escorts to a multi millionaire, later convinced them they were victims of rape–Epstein was dead and the only person left to sue was Ghislaine Maxwell ,” Kraus wrote in an Instagram story.""I was raped 25 times on the island,"" Kraus wrote, mocking one of Epstein’s victims. “Maybe stop boarding the flights that take you to (Epstein’s) island,” she added.Unlike other conservative commentators who condemned Epstein and Maxwell, Kraus, who also attended Maxwell's trial, used her platform to defend her and cast doubt on survivors’ claims.She has publicly worn a “Free Ghislaine” t-shirt and called out other influencers who disagreed with her position.Kraus also criticised the MeToo movement in her posts, writing that it “overlooks facts and common sense” and can allow victims to “twist and manipulate the story.” She urged followers to examine the facts rather than automatically believe survivors’ accounts.Earlier this year, Kraus was among a group of pro-Trump online personalities given a binder containing “Phase 1” of the Epstein Files by the White House. The files largely contained information already in the public domain.Speaking alongside Republican and Democratic members of Congress, Epstein-survivors recently urged US president Donald Trump to release additional Epstein Files and hold those involved accountable.

Donald Trump's tariff battle: US Supreme Court fast-tracks review; presidential power limits questioned,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/donald-trumps-tariff-battle-us-supreme-court-fast-tracks-review-presidential-power-limits-questioned/articleshow/123798708.cms,"Donald Trump (File photo)





The Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to take up a fast-track review of the Trump administration’s sweeping global tariffs, setting a November hearing that could decide the fate of one of US President Donald Trump ’s most significant economic policies.The justices approved an unusually brisk schedule after a federal appeals court last month struck down much of the program, ruling in a 7-4 decision that Trump unlawfully invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose steep import taxes on major US trading partners. The tariffs, however, will remain in effect during the litigation.Five small businesses and a dozen states had challenged the duties, arguing that Congress — not the president — holds the power to levy taxes. “Congress, not the President alone, has the power to impose tariffs,” said Jeffrey Schwab of the Liberty Justice Center, representing affected enterprises that warn of near-bankruptcy under the duties.The administration countered that the 1977 emergency law gives the president broad authority to regulate imports when national security or the economy is threatened. Solicitor General D. John Sauer warned that the appeals court ruling “casts a pall of uncertainty upon ongoing foreign negotiations that the president has been pursuing through tariffs … jeopardizing both already negotiated framework deals and ongoing negotiations,"" as quoted by NYT.The stakes are high: Trump has used tariffs both as leverage in trade talks and as a revenue source, with collections reaching £159 billion by late August — more than double last year’s figure. Officials also cautioned that overturning the tariffs could force the Treasury to refund billions, potentially affecting resources earmarked for fentanyl control and support for Ukraine in its war with Russia.The case marks the first time the Supreme Court will hear full arguments on Trump’s expansive use of emergency powers, after previously granting temporary approvals for other policies. With a conservative majority that includes three Trump appointees, the court will now weigh whether presidential authority under IEEPA extends to such far-reaching trade actions — or whether Congress must reclaim the power to tax.","The Supreme Court agreed to take up a fast-track review of the Trump administration’s sweeping global tariffs, setting a November hearing that could decide the fate of one of US President Donald Trump ’s most significant economic policies.

Farmers stage massive protests in Andhra Pradesh over urea shortages and crop prices,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/ysrcp-sponsored-farmers-protest-receives-huge-response-despite-police-restrictions-in-andhra-pradesh/articleshow/123798625.cms,"



VIJAYAWADA: Amidst tension and police restrictions, the YSRCP-sponsored farmers' protest, ""Annadatha Poru,"" received a huge response in different parts of the state.Dharnas and protest rallies were held at 74 RDO and Sub-Collector offices, demanding justice for the farmers. Former ministers, former legislators, and senior leaders led the agitation and highlighted farmers' core issues, including fair MSP for crops, a shortage of urea, free crop insurance, and timely input subsidies. Following the call of YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, memorandums were submitted to local officials.YSRCP General Secretary and MLC Lella Appireddy said that leaders across districts, including even village-level cadre, were served notices, threatened with cases, and placed under house arrest. Still, farmers defied these attempts and took to the streets. “If this is democracy, what kind of governance is Naidu running?” he asked.He reminded that under YS Jagan’s govt, farmers never needed to protest, as problems were anticipated and resolved through proactive governance. Surprisingly, farmers are forced into the streets only because Naidu is indifferent to their plight. Naidu, a four-time CM, continues his infamous stand that “agriculture is waste,” he alleged.Appireddy said that no crop received a fair price since the Naidu-led NDA returned to power. He said that farmers stood in queues for two months for urea and yet returned empty-handed. Instead of addressing their pain, Naidu dismisses them as “politically motivated,” only to escape from his responsibility, said Appireddy.YSRCP alleged that TDP leaders were behind the diversion of urea into the black market, forcing farmers to pay Rs 200 above MRP. The party slammed Minister Atchannaidu’s arrogant remark that farmers could “stand in queues for meals, so why not for urea?” Naidu’s contradictory claims, saying there is no shortage while also pleading with the Centre for supply, show the govt’s failure and dishonesty.With drought reducing cultivation by 60% in parts of the state, the govt has failed even to distribute half the required fertiliser. On paper, it shows abundant urea, but in reality, farmers struggle without supplies. Police and officials deliberately turn a blind eye while TDP leaders profit from black marketing.YSRC leaders highlighted YS Jagan’s RBKs (Rythu Bharosa Kendras), which ensured farmers received every input from seed to sale. “Jagan walked with farmers, but Naidu’s coalition is conspiring to destroy agriculture,” senior leader Hafeez Khan criticised. “The agitation is not the end, but only the beginning. No intimidation or arrests will silence farmers. YSRCP will stand by them until every demand is met. This anti-farmer govt will collapse under the weight of their anger,” said Hafeez Khan during a protest in Kurnool.","Dharnas and protest rallies were held at 74 RDO and Sub-Collector offices, demanding justice for the farmers.

NEW DELHI: Five people sustained minor burn injuries after a fire broke out outside at a pizza outlet in northeast Delhi's Yamuna Vihar on Monday night, police said. The blaze, triggered by a short circuit, also caused a small LPG cylinder to explode.According to the police, the incident was reported at 9pm from outside the restaurant.

Deadly protests: Is Nepal returning to monarchy? What prophecy says,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/deadly-protests-is-nepal-returning-to-monarchy-what-prophecy-says/articleshow/123798038.cms,"The Prophecy







Nepal Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli on Tuesday gave in to widespread Gen Z protests against the government’s decision to ban several social media platforms.After the government rolled back its order and lifted the bans, the demonstrations shifted focus on the second day, continuing with renewed momentum—this time targeting the government’s widespread corruption.Now, all eyes are on who will succeed Oli and take over the government.Interestingly, the Gen Z protests come just months after the Rashtriya Prajatantra Party, along with pro-royalists, Hindu nationalists, and anti-federalists, held massive “pro-monarchy” demonstrations in Kathmandu.Tens of thousands of protesters had taken to the streets, demanding the restoration of the abolished monarchy and the reinstatement of the former king as head of state.The protestors also called for the revival of Hinduism as Nepal’s state religion.""Raja aaunparcha"" (The king must return), they chanted.This groundswell of support comes amid deep frustration over Nepal’s post-monarchy period, which has been marked by instability. Since King Gyanendra stepped down, the country has witnessed more than a dozen regime changes.However, the push to restore the monarchy faces formidable barriers rooted in a centuries-old prophecy attributed to Guru Gorakhnath.According to Hindu belief, Gorakhnath, acting as a divine messenger, blessed Prithvi Narayan Shah—the 18th-century unifier of Nepal—with a monarchy destined to last for 11 generations.Royalist supporters widely embrace this prophecy, believing it reached its conclusion with King Dipendra Shah. Dipendra briefly ascended the throne while in a coma following the 2001 royal massacre—a tragedy that marked the monarchy’s rapid decline.His short reign was seen as the fulfilment of Gorakhnath’s blessing, and the eventual abolition of the Shah dynasty in 2008 was interpreted as the prophecy coming to pass.When Nepal’s constituent assembly formally ended the monarchy, many believers saw it not as a historical accident but as part of a cosmic plan.In 2008, the flag of Nepal’s 240-year-old Shah dynasty was lowered from the main palace in Kathmandu after the world’s last Hindu monarchy was abolished, two years after mass street protests forced Gyanendra to step down from absolute rule.Nepal then became a federal democratic republic, but since that transition, many citizens have grown frustrated with persistent political instability and worsening economic conditions.Despite the growing support for a royal revival, Gyanendra has remained silent on the renewed calls for his return. Political analysts believe his chances of reclaiming the throne remain slim. The republic is constitutionally enshrined, and mainstream political parties continue to strongly oppose reinstating the monarchy.Gyanendra, who first ascended the throne in 2002 after the tragic massacre of his brother King Birendra and his family, initially served as a constitutional monarch. However, in 2005, he seized absolute power—dissolving the government and parliament, jailing politicians and journalists, and imposing emergency rule.His authoritarian move sparked mass protests that ultimately led to the monarchy’s downfall and the establishment of a republic.","Nepal Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli on Tuesday gave in to widespread Gen Z protests against the government’s decision to ban several social media platforms.

US president Donald Trump faced protests on Tuesday evening while dining at a restaurant in Washington DC.As Trump entered Joe’s Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab, near the White House, a small group of demonstrators chanted “Free DC” and “Free Palestine,” calling him “the Hitler of our time. ” Other diners booed the protesters.Trump responded with, “We have a safe city, so that’s good. Enjoy yourself. You won’t be mugged going home,” he told the diners.The protesters were later escorted out, according to CNN.Trump was accompanied by secretary of state Marco Rubio, vice president JD Vance and defence secretary Pete Hegseth.Speaking to reporters outside before dinner, Trump said his administration’s recent crime crackdown had made the city safe and hinted at announcing a similar operation in another city soon.“We’ll be announcing another city that we’re going to very shortly, we’re working it out,” he said.The president noted he would not have risked dining in DC months earlier. “This was one of the most unsafe cities in the country. Now it’s as safe as there is in the country, so we’re here with cabinet members having dinner, and everybody should go out,” he said.His remarks came a month after the administration expanded federal control over DC policing, deploying law enforcement and troops in the capital.","Demonstrators chant 'Free DC' and 'Free Palestine' as Trump dines near White House.

Israeli strike in Doha kills six, sparks Qatar anger

JD Vance backs Donald Trump





US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said that he was “not thrilled about whole situation” with Israel’s strike on Hamas leadership in Qatar and announced he would deliver a full statement on the incident tomorrow. He also warned that the attack could jeopardize fragile efforts to secure a Gaza ceasefire.“I’m not thrilled about the whole situation. It’s not a good situation,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “But I will say this, we want the hostages back, but we are not thrilled about the way that went down. I’ll be giving a full statement tomorrow, but I will tell you this — I was very unhappy about every aspect.”The statement came after Israeli Air Force jets struck residential buildings in Doha’s Katara district, targeting Hamas leaders who were meeting to discuss Trump’s ceasefire proposal for Gaza.While the top Hamas officials survived, six people, including a Qatari security officer were killed. The strike drew a sharp condemnation from Qatar, which denounced it as “state terrorism” and vowed to respond.The Israeli military, for its part, defended the strike, saying it used “precise munitions” and “additional intelligence” to minimize civilian casualties while vowing to continue targeting Hamas leaders abroad.Witnesses in Doha reported multiple explosions and plumes of smoke rising over the Katara district.The attack has complicated Trump’s ongoing attempts to secure a Gaza ceasefire while exposing strains in his relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and with Washington’s Gulf allies.Several of Trump’s own advisers expressed anger that Israel did not notify the United States in advance and that the administration was unable to warn Qatari officials, news agency CNN reported.According to US officials, US President first learned of the operation only shortly before it began not from Israel, but from Chairman of the Joint Staff General Dan Caine. He then instructed White House special envoy Steve Witkoff, who has close ties with Doha, to alert the Qataris. But by the time Witkoff could reach them, it was too late.The lack of communication further fueled White House frustration, particularly since Witkoff had met with Netanyahu’s adviser Ron Dermer just a day earlier but was not informed of the imminent strike.In a separate post on his Truth Social platform, Trump stressed that the strike was a decision made by Prime Minister Netanyahu and he was not involved in it.He criticised the attack, calling it a unilateral strike in a “Sovereign Nation and close Ally of the United States” that “does not advance Israel or America’s goals.” However, he added that “eliminating Hamas, who have profited off the misery of those living in Gaza, is a worthy goal.”Vice President JD Vance on Tuesday voiced frustration over Israel’s strike on Hamas leaders in Doha, saying President Donald Trump believed the move did not advance either US or Israeli interests.“The president made very clear today that he’s not happy about that – we just left the Oval Office and spoke about that,” Vance said in a pre-taped interview with One America News Network host Matt Gaetz.“You saw Karoline Leavitt, our great White House press secretary, talk about this – he doesn’t think this serves Israel’s interests or the United States’ interests, and so he’s not happy about it, but we’re going to keep on working for peace despite it.”Vance also pointed to what he called a “silver lining,” saying the strike likely removed “a couple of very bad guys from Hamas,” even though he stressed the administration disagreed with the decision to carry it out.","US President Donald Trump said that he was “not thrilled about whole situation” with Israel’s strike on Hamas leadership in Qatar.

'Looking forward to speak with my good friend Modi': Trump





United States is considering expanding tariffs on countries that buy Russian oil, including India, but only if the European Union takes similar steps, a US official told news agency AFP on Tuesday.According to the report, dialling in to talks between US and EU officials, president Donald Trump suggested tariffs of between 50 and 100 per cent on buyers such as China and India.“The source of the money for the Russian war machine is oil purchases by China and India. If you do not get at the source of the money, there’s no way to stop the war machine,” the official said as quoted. Trump, the official added, is “ready to go” but wants the EU to act alongside the US.The discussions in Washington reportedly were led by EU sanctions envoy David O’Sullivan, with US treasury secretary Scott Bessent and officials from the state department and the US trade representative also taking part. Ukraine’s prime minister joined the session, while Trump made his intervention remotely, said the official.A separate official pointed to a bill with 85 Senate co-sponsors that would allow secondary tariffs on countries trading with Russia, but questioned whether the European parliament has the political will to follow through, wrote AFP.The report comes as Trump on Tuesday said he looked forward to speaking with Prime Minister Narendra Modi “in the coming weeks.”Calling PM Modi a “very good friend,” Trump said talks are continuing to resolve trade barriers between the two countries. “I feel certain that there will be no difficulty in coming to a successful conclusion for both of our great countries,” he wrote on Truth Social.Also read: Trump says India-US trade talks to continue; confident of successful outcome The remarks follow Trump’s recent comments at the White House, where he described ties with India as “very special” but said he disagreed with some of New Delhi’s policies.

Who was Katie Abraham

Katie Abraham was a 20-year-old student from Glenview, Illinois.

She was a junior at Ohio University at the time of her death.

Katie played water polo and competed in travel tournaments and the USA Water Polo Junior Olympics. She and her friend, Chloe Polzin, were part of the East Side Water Polo Club.

Polzin became a full organ donor after being declared brain dead a day after the crash.

Her father, Joe Abraham, described her as spirited, sharp-witted, and someone who made others feel seen. “She was very engaging. Her sense of humor was incredible. Her wit was so sharp,” he said.





US department of homeland security (DHS) on Monday said it was dedicating a Chicago deportation drive to Katie Abraham killed earlier this year in a hit-and-run crash in Urbana.Abraham and her friend, 21-year-old Chloe Polzin, died on January 19 when their car was struck by a Guatemalan man who police say was driving under the influence and fled the scene. Three others in the vehicle were also injured.Authorities said the driver initially used a false identity but was later identified as 29-year-old Julio Cucul-Bol, a Guatemalan national. He faces charges of reckless homicide, aggravated DUI resulting in death, and leaving the scene of a fatal crash. Federal prosecutors have also accused him of using falsified documents, including a passport and social security card.US president Donald Trump and Republican leaders have highlighted Abraham’s death, calling her parents “angel parents,” a term the administration has used to describe relatives of victims killed by people who lack legal status. Her family has spoken out against sanctuary policies in Illinois, saying the tragedy could have been prevented with stricter immigration checks.Also read: 'Operation Midway Blitz': Trump administration begins immigration crackdown in Chicago; DHS announces mission","Katie Abraham was a 20-year-old student from Glenview, Illinois.

For that, I have also called an all-party meeting at 6 pm today. I humbly request all brothers and sisters to remain calm in this difficult situation,” he said.He reacted to the GenZ protests that shook Nepal on Monday, blaming ""ambiguity between the thinking"" of the generation.

On Cam: Panic Erupts As Drone Hits Greta Thunberg’s Gaza Flotilla Boat In Tunisian Port





Organisers of a Gaza-bound flotilla said one of their aid boats was struck by a suspected drone late Monday off the coast of Tunisia — a claim Tunisian authorities quickly disputed.The Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF) said its “Family Boat,” anchored near the port of Sidi Bou Said, was hit by what they believe was a UAV, sparking a fire on board. Security camera footage shared by the group captured a humming sound, a flash of light, and frantic cries for help. No one was injured in the incident.“This was 100 per cent a drone that dropped a bomb,” one activist said in a video posted by Brazilian campaigner Thiago Avila.But Tunisian officials dismissed the claim. National Guard spokesman Houcem Eddine Jebabli told AFP that “no drones have been detected” and said preliminary findings suggested the blaze broke out in the life jackets. Authorities later floated the possibility that the fire may have been caused by a cigarette.The competing accounts fueled confusion, with UN special rapporteur Francesca Albanese amplifying the flotilla’s footage on X and urging viewers to “draw your conclusions.”The flotilla, made up of more than 20 boats and carrying aid and pro-Palestinian activists including Greta Thunberg , set sail from Barcelona in late August with the stated goal of breaking Israel’s blockade on Gaza. Israel has already intercepted two such missions this year.The Global Sumud Flotilla insists the alleged strike was an act of intimidation. “Our peaceful mission to break the siege on Gaza and stand in solidarity with its people continues with determination and resolve,” the group said.The United Nations has declared famine in parts of Gaza, warning that nearly 500,000 people face “catastrophic” conditions.Meanwhile, Israel has repeatedly warned it would intercept the flotilla and detain activists in what local media described as “terrorist-level” conditions.","Global Sumud Flotilla says one of their aid boats was struck by a suspected drone off the coast of Tunisia.

Another letter in spotlight





Monday came with a massive shock for many, including US President Donald Trump , after Democrats in the House Oversight Committee released new Epstein files, including a 2003 birthday album. The album has caught the attention of many, as it includes a sexually suggestive letter purportedly signed by Trump for Jeffrey Epstein Epstein was a disgraced financier who died in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.First, the Wall Street Journal described the letter earlier this year. The letter, alleged to be signed by Trump, was unveiled as part of a 50th birthday compilation for Epstein. The letter includes short dialogue between Donald and Epstein and a hand-drawn outline of a curvaceous woman.""We have certain things in common,"" says Donald.Jeffrey responds, ""Yes, we do, come to think of it.""""Enigmas never age, have you noticed that?"" asks Donald.""As a matter of fact, it was clear to me the last time I saw you,"" says Jeffrey.""A pal is a wonderful thing. Happy Birthday -- and may every day be another wonderful secret,"" the note ends, followed by Trump's signature.US President Trump had denied authoring the letter to Epstein and drawing the outline of a curvaceous woman.""These are not my words, not the way I talk. Also, I don't draw pictures,"" the president had said. He had also sued The Wall Street Journal for $10 billion, calling its earlier reporting on the letter ""false, malicious, and defamatory.""White House officials echoed that defence in their latest. ""It's very clear President Trump did not draw this picture, and he did not sign it,"" press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement posted on X. Deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich shared images of Trump’s signature over the years, claiming the one on the letter does not match.Another letter from the birthday book has come into the light that mentions Trump. It includes a photo of Epstein holding an oversized $22,500 check, apparently signed by the real estate magnate.""Jeffrey showing early talents with money + women! Sells 'fully depreciated' [redacted name] to Donald Trump,"" reads the note.The committee published a copy of Trump's alleged letter to Epstein before the entire book was released. It prompted sharp reactions from Republicans. Republican chairman James Comer accused the committee of ""cherry-picking documents and politicising information.""","Democrats in the House Oversight Committee released new Epstein files, including a 2003 birthday album.

US president Donald Trump stepped out for dinner on Tuesday night at a restaurant near the White House, as he continued to promote his decision to deploy the National Guard and place Washington’s police force under federal control. Vice president JD Vance, war secretary Pete Hegseth and secretary of state Marco Rubio were also with Trump.His short motorcade ride to Joe’s Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab, came after weeks of him boasting that federal action had turned the capital into “a safe zone.”Speaking to reporters during the rare outing, Trump said, ""It's a safe city and I just want to thank the National Guard... The outcome is really spectacular. We have a capital that's very, very safe right now.""Trump told reporters last week that dining out was something he wanted to try, “I love the White House food, but after a while, I could see going to a nice restaurant. It’s safe.”Since the crackdown began on August 7, some restaurants have reported fewer reservations, and protests have broken out in several neighbourhoods. Increased patrols have at times led to standoffs between residents and authorities, according to news agency Associated Press.The White House has said nearly 2,200 arrests have been made in Washington since the crackdown started. Similar moves have already been carried out in Los Angeles, and Trump has threatened to send troops to other Democratic-run cities such as Baltimore, New Orleans and Chicago.On Saturday, Trump posted a parody image of Apocalypse Now showing helicopters over Chicago’s skyline, writing: “I love the smell of deportations in the morning. Chicago about to find out why it’s called the Department of WAR.”The post followed his executive order to rename the Defence Department as the Department of War, a change that still needs Congress approval. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker responded by calling Trump a “wannabe dictator,” joining other officials and residents who say a federal crackdown in Chicago is not needed.","US president Donald Trump went out for dinner on Tuesday night at a restaurant near the White House.
