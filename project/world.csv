Flight data downloaded: AAIB to issue preliminary report on Ajit Pawar’s Baramati plane crash,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/flight-data-downloaded-aaib-to-issue-preliminary-report-on-ajit-pawars-baramati-plane-crash/articleshow/128589301.cms,"NEW DELHI: Data from the Digital Flight Data Recorder of Ajit Pawar's crashed Learjet 45 near Baramati has been successfully downloaded at the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau’s Flight Recorder Laboratory, the ministry of civil aviation said on Thursday, adding that a preliminary report into the January 28 accident will be issued within 30 days in line with ICAO norms and that all investigative actions are being taken with full transparency and professional integrity.Maharashtra Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and four others were killed in the crash.The ministry said the AAIB’s probe is technical and evidence based. It involves systematic examination of wreckage, operational and maintenance records and laboratory testing of components where required.The crashed VSR Ventures-owned Learjet 45 was equipped with a Digital Flight Data Recorder and a Cockpit Voice Recorder. Both devices were exposed to intense heat and sustained fire damage. Data from the DFDR, manufactured by L3-Communications, has been successfully downloaded at AAIB’s Flight Recorder Laboratory.""The Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR), manufactured by Honeywell, is undergoing detailed technical examination. Assistance has been sought from the Accredited Representative of the State of Manufacture for specialised support in data retrieval,"" AAIB said in a statement on February 17.Following the accident, the ministry directed the Directorate General of Civil Aviation to conduct a special audit of VSR Ventures. The audit covers regulatory compliance, operational control systems, maintenance practices, crew training standards, safety management systems and CVR and FDR monitoring.""The audit commenced on February 4, 2026, and is expected to conclude shortly. Findings will be reviewed, and action will be taken in accordance with DGCA’s Enforcement Policy and Procedures Manual,"" the ministry said.The regulator has also been asked to carry out special audits of other major non-scheduled operators and aerodromes engaged in VIP and VVIP operations. These audits are being conducted in phases and enforcement action will be taken wherever required.In 2025, the DGCA conducted 51 regulatory audits of non-scheduled operators, the ministry said. It added that multiple surveillances of VSR Ventures were carried out in areas including flight safety systems, flight duty time limitations, maintenance compliance, documentation and station facilities, and that all findings were addressed and closed.""Stakeholders are requested to refrain from speculation and allow the statutory investigation and regulatory processes to proceed in accordance with established procedures,"" the ministry said, reiterating that all investigative and regulatory actions are proceeding with full transparency and professional integrity.Meanwhile, political reactions intensified with fresh demands for an independent inquiry.Nationalist Congress Party leader Rohit Pawar called for the Aviation Minister to step down, alleging a possible conflict of interest.""The owner of VSR Aviation recently held his son's wedding in Jaipur, Rajasthan, which was attended by a main leader of the TDP. The Aviation Minister belongs to that party. If they can attend the wedding of the VSR Aviation owner's son, the investigation may not proceed in the right direction. That is why we believe he should not remain in that post while the investigation is ongoing,"" he said.He further said, ""Everyone should demand a different kind of inquiry. If everyone conducts a transparent inquiry, we can reach a proper conclusion. So, I welcome that move. Though it is a little late, it doesnot matter. What matters is that the investigation should be done by many organisations and investigation agencies, but along with this, some international agencies should also be involved.""NCP working President Praful Patel also demanded a CBI inquiry into the crash."" After the tragic demise of Ajit Pawar, we should also get information whether every aspect is being investigated in the right direction or not. Today, AAIB is investigating technical matters. I have heard that the black box is also going to America for investigation. Perhaps they have not been able to investigate thoroughly here. The state government has also given the investigation to the CID. But after such a big accident involving such a big leader, we feel that information should be obtained from every aspect. CBI is a reliable organisation. If the investigation is done by CBI, then some facts and aspects should also be taken into account. CBI can do this work.""",Data from the Digital Flight Data Recorder of Ajit Pawar's crashed Learjet 45 has been successfully downloaded at the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau’s Flight Recorder Laboratory.

Chhattisgarh HC: No automatic bail for juveniles in heinous crimes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-no-automatic-bail-for-juveniles-in-heinous-crimes/articleshow/128586839.cms,"Chhattisgarh HC

Raipur: Chhattisgarh HC has dismissed a juvenile's appeal for bail in a 2025 murder case , saying such relief can't be treated as an absolute or automatic rig-ht and release will ""defeat the ends of justice"" given the gravity of the offence.Justice Arvind Kumar Verma upheld earlier orders of Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) and a sessions court in Chhattisgarh's Dhamtari, and held the HC was ""not convinced"" that a juvenile could claim bail without courts examining the nature of the offence.""JJB and the sessions court rightly prioritised child protection over routine bail in a heinous offence like murder. Such acts amount to a grave rupture of social order, violate the inherent dignity of childhood, and demand collective vigilance to restore moral balance,"" Justice Verma observed in his Feb 13 judgment.The minor filed the criminal revision plea under the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, challenging the order of the sessions court on Oct 31, 2025 rejecting bail. He allegedly stabbed Vikas Dhruv in Dhamtari following an altercation on June 6 last year.The minor's counsel argued that the lower courts had failed to appreciate the reformative spirit of the 2015 law, and continued detention in an observation home would expose him to criminal influence. The counsel said the attack occurred in self-defence and that the accused had no prior criminal records and came from a poor family.Govt counsel Vivek Sharma contended that the lower courts had properly assessed the evidence, highlighting the serious nature of the crime.",Chhattisgarh HC has dismissed a juvenile's appeal for bail in a 2025 murder case.

New Delhi: Jolted by allegations of anti-Brahmin bias, FIRs and court petitions, the producer of 'Ghooskhor Pandat' on Thursday filed an affidavit informing Supreme Court of the decision to withdraw the film's title and not use the words that had hurt the sentiments of a section of society anywhere in the Manoj Bajpayee-starrer.Senior advocate Neeraj Kishan Kaul, appearing for producer Neeraj Pandey , told a bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and Ujjal Bhuyan that given the concerns expressed over the teaser since its release on Feb 3, the promotional material had been withdrawn.He said the film was a fictional police drama that revolved around a criminal investigation without portraying any caste, religion, community or sect as corrupt.In his affidavit, Pandey said, ""I respectfully submit that the earlier title, 'Ghooskhor Pandat', stands unequivocally withdrawn and shall not be used in any manner whatsoever. While the new title has not yet been finalised, I undertake that any title that may hereafter be identified and adopted shall not be similar to, or evocative of, the earlier title in respect of which objections were raised and shall accurately reflect the narrative and intent of the film without giving rise to unintended interpretations.

Parents' qualification doesn't matter in custody battle: Calcutta HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/parents-qualification-doesnt-matter-in-custody-battle-calcutta-hc/articleshow/128586587.cms,"Calcutta HC

Kolkata: The child of a separated couple who has been living with his father for five years cannot be ""planted som-ewhere else"" even if the father's educational qualification is less than the mother's, Calcutta HC held on Tuesday.The mother, who was recently awarded custody of the child by a trial court, has a master's in music. She runs a music school and is also a private tutor. The father, whose custody claim over the 8-year-old has been upheld by the high court, is a matriculate and earns a living selling fish.The child, who has been living with his father since the couple separated five years ago, had told the trial court judge that he wanted to stay with both parents.Since the couple filed for restitution of conjugal rights several times while the custody battle was on, a HC division bench of Justices Sabyasachi Bhattacharyya and Supratim Bhattacharya observed on Tuesday: ""It transpires that all is still not lost and there is ample scope for the parties reconciling their matrimonial disputes, as well as a chance of the parties staying together as a couple by shedding their personal differences, which will be of utmost benefit to the child in the final count.The bench referred the couple for mediation, to be supervised by the Calcutta HC mediation committee. The committee was requested to include a psychologist in the mediation.The trial court in a recent order had noted that the father earned more than the mother but awarded custody to the mother on the grounds that she was more educated. The judge had observed that the child's upbringing would be affected if he were to be deprived of his mother's love.Acting on an appeal by the father against the trial court order, the division bench observed on Tuesday: ""The finding of the trial judge is that any detachment of the minor from his mother may cause a scratch in the mind of the minor, who is eight years old. That scratch was caused five years ago; from age three to eight, he has been residing with his father... He has been living with his father for five years; now we cannot pick him up and plant him somewhere else. ""The bench also observed: ""The trial judge was swayed more by personal inclinations and views than the facts of the case.""The couple separated in 2021, when the child was just three. The man has alleged that his wife left to live at her paternal home, while the woman claimed she had been driven out of the house by her husband.The division bench said no evidence was provided to establish that the child's education suffered during the five years he was with his father. Rather, it was noted that the child is being tutored by his aunt and two private tutors.The mother has been granted visitation rights by the high court.","The child of a separated couple who has been living with his father for five years cannot be ""planted som-ewhere else"" even if the father's educational qualification is less than the mother's, Calcutta HC held.

Indore MBA Student Murder: Boyfriend Smirks at Reporters After Arrest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/indore/kya-karoge-jaan-ke-murdered-indore-mba-students-boyfriend-shows-no-remorse-smirks-at-reporters/articleshow/128491700.cms,"



INDORE: Displaying striking indifference during a crime scene reconstruction, the accused in the murder of a 24-year-old MBA student reacted casually when questioned by reporters, brushing aside queries about the killing.Surrounded by media personnel on Tuesday, Piyush Dhamnodiya shrugged off questions about the motive behind the murder. “Kuch nai hua hai, chhodo, ho gaya jo hogaya yaar… chhod do na… kya karoge jaan ke,” he said in Hindi, refusing to explain his actions. When asked whether he regretted the crime, he responded with a faint smirk and said he would reveal the reason “when the time comes”.Police officials present at the reconstruction described his demeanour as unusually calm. Officers said his behaviour during interrogation and subsequent proceedings appeared erratic and detached.According to investigators, the accused allegedly muttered apologies in the hours following the crime and claimed he wanted to “communicate with the victim’s spirit”. He also told police he had contemplated suicide by jumping in front of a train but did not act on it.During questioning at the Dwarkapuri police station, Dhamnodiya reportedly asked for a blank sheet of paper and wrote that he had committed a “grave wrong” and wanted to die.He repeatedly requested officers to let him meet the victim, claiming he loved her.DCP Krishna Lalchandani said the accused had been consuming occult-related online content and searching for suicide methods, though he never attempted self-harm. Investigators also learned that Dhamnodiya suspected the victim of speaking to other men.Police said the woman’s body was recovered on Feb 13 from a rented room in Indore, three days after she was reported missing. Dhamnodiya, identified as her boyfriend and classmate, was traced to Mumbai and arrested from Andheri on Feb 14.During interrogation, police alleged that Dhamnodiya tied the victim’s hands and legs, gagged her and strangled her. Officers further claimed he later purchased beer, returned to the room and consumed alcohol beside the body. Investigators accused him of sexually assaulting the corpse and engaging in acts of necrophilia before fleeing.Police said the accused travelled by train after leaving Indore, changing routes before reaching Mumbai. Investigators stated he later went to a deserted location near Panvel, where he allegedly lit incense sticks and watched online videos about summoning spirits.Dwarkapuri police seized items linked to the crime and recreated the scene. The accused is scheduled to be produced before a court on Wednesday.","Piyush Dhamnodiya shrugged off questions about the motive behind the murder.

Gurgaon: Shocking Murder, School Chaos, Delivery Scam Bust & More





ROHTAK: The murder of a 27-year-old bank employee, found with her throat slit near Bahadurgarh in Jhajjar district, was solved within 18 hours, with police arresting her husband — a chartered accountant from Hisar — as the prime accused.Investigators said the accused killed his wife over repeated suspicions about her character and then attempted to pass it off as a robbery-cum-murder.The victim, Mahak, worked with HDFC Bank in Gurgaon.She was married to Anshul Dhawan, a chartered accountant and resident of Hisar’s Sector 14, on September 25, 2025, in an arranged marriage. The couple had been married for barely five months.On Valentine’s Day (February 14), the couple visited Hisar and stayed with family.The next evening, around 7 pm on February 15, they left Mahak’s parental home in Hansi for Gurugram. About four hours later, Anshul called the police, claiming unidentified attackers had intercepted their car near Pahsaur village in the Badli area of Jhajjar district, killed his wife, and fled.Police found Mahak’s body lying outside the car on a dirt track about 100 metres off the Jhajjar-Badli road. Her throat had been slit.However, Anshul’s version soon fell apart during questioning. He failed to describe the alleged attackers and repeatedly changed his statement.During sustained interrogation and a crime scene reconstruction, Anshul confessed. Police said the couple frequently argued over his suspicions about Mahak’s character. The dispute escalated during the drive, leading him to first strangle her and then slit her throat with a pair of scissors, allegedly while wearing gloves to avoid leaving evidence. He later staged the scene to resemble a robbery.Mahak’s father, Krishna Kathuria, had expressed suspicion against his son-in-law from the outset. Family members also stated that Mahak was pregnant at the time of her death.Police have arrested the accused and are proceeding with further investigation.","The victim, Mahak, worked with HDFC Bank in Gurgaon.

Imphal/Churachandpur: A fractured state tried to talk to itself. For the first time since ethnic violence tore Manipur apart in May 2023, chief minister Yumnam Khemchand Singh addressed on Thursday displaced Meitei and Kuki-Zo families together - on a shared platform, if only virtually - pairing cash relief with an appeal to rebuild trust.The outreach, anchored at a relief camp in Langol of Imphal West district, connected displaced Meitei families in the valley with Kuki-Zo inmates of camps in Churachandpur and Kangpokpi via video link. Direct benefit transfers were credited during the meet.Each displaced person received Rs 2,420 for essentials. Families whose homes were burnt are being paid Rs 1 lakh in instalments, officials said.More than 260 people have been killed and over 60,000 displaced since clashes erupted between Meitei and Kuki communities in 2023. Since then, movement has been sharply curtailed - valley residents rarely enter Kuki-majority hills, and Kukis seldom travel into Imphal.Singh said resettlement had begun in peripheral areas, but restoring homes in sensitive zones remained difficult. ""Resettling IDPs (internally displaced persons) to their original places is a priority, though challenges remain. While tensions have eased, mistrust continues,"" he said, urging social groups and families to help bridge the divide.It was a modest step - cheques and promises - but the first time the state tried to stitch two wounded communities into the same conversation. Voices from camps cut through the screen. A young Kuki woman from Kangpokpi asked for access to jobs and higher education. A Meitei woman broke down, pleading to return home after three years in a camp. Another Kuki-Zo inmate flagged the struggle to reach hospitals.The CM promised security for Kuki-Zo patients visiting Imphal and special plans for about 6,000 displaced students whose schooling has been disrupted. ""I'm no god, but I will not let your tears go in vain,"" Singh said.","The outreach connected displaced Meitei families in the valley with Kuki-Zo inmates of camps in Churachandpur and Kangpokpi via video link.

Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj

Tipu Sultan

Why did it explode into controversy



BJP activists protest against Maharashtra Congress chief Harshwardhan Sapkal's remarks equating Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj with Tipu Sultan outside Congress Bhavan, in Pune.

From portrait to protests



Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis pays tribute to the greatest king, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj at Shivtirtha, Ichalkaranji, in Kolhapur.

History does not always stay in textbooks. Sometimes, it returns framed on a wall. In Malegaon, a portrait of the 18th-century Mysore ruler Tipu Sultan , briefly placed inside the office of a newly-elected deputy mayor, triggered a political controversy that has travelled far beyond the municipal corporation building where it began.Within 48 hours, the image was removed by the civic administration, the matter escalated into a war of words between Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and state Congress chief Harshwardhan Sapkal, protests broke out in multiple cities, and eight people were injured in stone pelting in Pune.At the centre of the row was not merely the presence of Tipu Sultan’s portrait but Sapkal’s statement comparing him with Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj as belonging “to the same league of valour”. The chief minister described the comparison as “unacceptable” and said the Congress politician should be “ashamed”. What followed was a familiar pattern in Indian public life where history, memory, symbolism and contemporary political positioning intersect.The controversy began after Shiv Sena corporators in Malegaon objected to the display of Tipu Sultan’s portrait in deputy mayor Shaan-e-Hind Nihal Ahmed’s office.A delegation met Malegaon civic chief Ravindra Jadhav, demanding that it be removed and warning of an agitation if the administration failed to act. The Malegaon Municipal Corporation on Saturday removed the portrait from the office.Jadhav confirmed that the administration examined the state government’s official protocol list, which outlines leaders whose anniversaries are observed and whose portraits are permitted for display in government offices, before taking the action. “Tipu Sultan’s name is not included in the list. Therefore, the portrait was removed from the deputy mayor’s office,” MMC officials said.Ahmed, however, defended the figure’s historical relevance. “Tipu Sultan fought against the British and was acknowledged for his bravery at that time. There are roads named after him in Mumbai and Nagpur. This is an attempt to divert attention from our work. Some people are unable to digest that two Muslim women are mayor and deputy mayor in Malegaon,” she told reporters.When asked about the controversy, Sapkal, speaking in Buldhana on Saturday, said, “He (Tipu Sultan) waged a war against the British and was a brave warrior. He was a son of the soil. He never entertained poisonous or divisive thoughts. We should view Tipu Sultan as an equal to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj as a symbol of bravery,” he said.CM Fadnavis called the comparison unacceptable. Congress “should be ashamed of equating the founder of Hindavi Swarajya with Tipu Sultan, who butchered 1,000s of Hindus,” he said.The episode reopened an older historical debate that has periodically entered political discourse as both figures occupy significant but very different spaces in Indian history.Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, born in 1630, is widely regarded as the founder of the Maratha state and the architect of Hindavi Swarajya. His military campaigns against the Mughal Empire and regional sultanates laid the foundation for a political formation that eventually expanded into one of the most powerful empires in early modern India.Shivaji’s legacy in Maharashtra is not confined to historical admiration alone. He represents resistance, self-rule, regional pride, and a warrior ethos deeply embedded in the state’s socio-political consciousness.Tipu Sultan, born in 1751, ruled the Kingdom of Mysore during a period of intense conflict between Indian polities and the expanding British East India Company. Alongside his father, Hyder Ali, he waged multiple wars against British forces and is remembered in several accounts as one of the earliest rulers to adopt modern military technologies such as iron-cased rockets.In 1799, Tipu Sultan died fighting the British during the siege of Srirangapatna.For many historians, Tipu Sultan’s significance lies in his sustained resistance to colonial expansion. For others, particularly in regions such as parts of Karnataka and Kerala, he remains a contested figure due to accounts of forced conversions, temple desecrations and harsh campaigns against certain communities.The debate over his rule has persisted for decades and has often been shaped by political context as much as archival evidence. These differing interpretations have given Tipu Sultan a complex afterlife in contemporary politics.In Maharashtra, Shivaji Maharaj occupies an almost sacred position across ideological lines, but particularly within the political vocabulary of the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) and Shiv Sena.The Maratha ruler is frequently invoked as a symbol of indigenous sovereignty, martial pride and cultural assertion. References to Hindavi Swarajya resonate strongly with narratives centred on civilisational identity and self-determination.Any perceived attempt to equate Shivaji Maharaj with another historical figure, especially one whose legacy is contested, therefore carries political sensitivity.BJP leaders have argued that comparisons diminish the unique historical role of Shivaji Maharaj. BJP Pune city president Dheeraj Ghate said, “Sapkal’s remarks deeply hurt the sentiments of all those who idolise Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj as a deity. It is a deliberate attempt to create a rift in society.”For the Congress, Tipu Sultan has at times represented anti-colonial resistance and an inclusive strand of historical nationalism. In southern states, especially Karnataka, Congress governments have celebrated Tipu Jayanti, framing him as a freedom fighter who resisted British rule.Political opponents, particularly from the BJP and allied organisations, have long argued that such commemorations reflect an attempt at minority outreach, with the emphasis on Tipu’s anti-British legacy seen by them as part of a broader effort to counter the rise of Hindutva-centred historical narratives.This divergence in emphasis reflects deeper ideological differences in how the past is mobilised in present day politics. While the BJP’s political messaging often foregrounds civilisational continuity and indigenous cultural pride aligned with Hindutva thought, the Congress has tended to promote pluralist interpretations of history that critics frequently characterise as accommodative or appeasement-driven in their political intent.The political undertone of invoking either figure is therefore significant. Shivaji Maharaj serves as a unifying icon in Maharashtra, but also as a potent symbol within a wider discourse on identity, sovereignty and cultural resurgence associated with Hindutva politics.Tipu Sultan, by contrast, often becomes a focal point in debates where his remembrance is interpreted by critics through the prism of Muslim appeasement versus majoritarian assertions of historical identity.The controversy in Malegaon quickly spread beyond the initial administrative decision. BJP and right organisation supporters protested in Nagpur, Nashik, Ahilyanagar, Sangli, Solapur, Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, Nanded, Latur and elsewhere. In Pune, Patit Pawan Sanghatana members were the first to assemble in front of the Congress Bhawan on Sunday morning, condemning Sapkal's remarks.Around 12.30 pm, BJP workers, including mayor Manjusha Nagpure, reached the site and started sloganeering and showing posters. By then, about 100 Congress workers reached the site and started raising counter slogans.“As the sloganeering was on from both sides, someone hurled a stone. This set off stone pelting by members from either side,” additional commissioner of police Manoj Patil said. “Two women constables, two reporters and two workers each from BJP and Congress were injured. “The nature of injuries was not serious,” he said.As political leaders weighed in, the debate widened. AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi defended Tipu Sultan, saying, “In 1799, Tipu Sultan died fighting the British,” and added, “He did not sit in jail and write love letters to the British.”Meanwhile, Telangana BJP president N Ramchander Rao said by glorifying Tipu Sultan, the AIMIM “is distorting history”.Amid mounting criticism, Sapkal later clarified his remarks. “My statement was misinterpreted by the BJP for political benefits. I said that there cannot be anyone like Shivaji Maharaj, and Tipu Sultan took inspiration from him.” He subsequently expressed regret, saying, “I did not say anything wrong about Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. The question of comparison does not arise; I did not make one.”He described Shivaji Maharaj as ""my ideal, my inspiration and my pride,"" and appealed for calm. “If any Shiv devotees' sentiments were hurt because of misuse of my words, I sincerely express regret. It was never my intention to hurt anyone's feelings. Let us put this matter to rest here.”Yet, the episode illustrates how historical figures continue to function as political signifiers in contemporary India. Portraits in public offices are rarely neutral. They signal not only admiration but also affiliation, narrative and sometimes ideological positioning.As demonstrations spread and leaders traded charges over historical interpretation, the controversy showed no immediate sign of abating. What began as the placement of a portrait has become a reminder that in Indian politics, the past remains an active participant in the present.

SRINAGAR: Operations were suspended at the 450MW stage 1 Baglihar hydropower project on the Chenab river in Jammu and Kashmir after it got flooded two days ago.As water entered the project’s machine room, engineers immediately halted power generation to prevent damage to critical electro-mechanical components. The project, located in Ramban district, is a major contributor to the region’s power supply. As the project’s stage 1 remains suspended, stage 2 which adds another 450 MW capacity, will be operational. It has not been impacted by the flooding, officials said.A senior official called it minor flooding which happened during scheduled maintenance. Stage 1 was anyway scheduled to remain closed for three months for repair works, the official said. “Since stage 1 has to stay shut for 90 days, we will operate stage 2 during the period,” he said.The official said stage 1 typically runs at full load for seven to eight months and at partial load for three to four months annually. Stage 2, however, operates only for about four months, from July to Sept, as per design, as there is not enough discharge to run both stages simultaneously during lean period. “Now that stage 1 is shut down for repairs, we will run stage 2, which otherwise remains closed during the lean period,” he said.","The 450MW stage 1 Baglihar hydropower project on the Chenab river in Jammu and Kashmir got flooded two days ago.

'Absolutely unacceptable': Israel condemns 'racially motivated' attack on 2 Indian workers in Ashkelon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/absolutely-unacceptable-israel-condemns-racially-motivated-attack-on-2-indian-workers-in-ashkelon/articleshow/128563201.cms,"(AP photo)

NEW DELHI: Israel on Thursday condemned the attack on two Indian workers in the city of Ashkelon, calling the incident “absolutely unacceptable.”The Israeli embassy in India also denounced the assault and said action had been taken against those responsible. In a post on X, it said, “The attack on two Indian workers yesterday in Ashkelon by delinquents is absolutely unacceptable. The Israeli police have caught the perpetrators and will bring them to justice.”The two workers were reportedly beaten in Ashkelon, located about 50 km from Tel Aviv. Israeli media described the assault as a “targeted, racially motivated attack.”Congress leader Pawan Khera raised concerns over the incident and urged External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar to intervene. In a post on X, he said, “It was a premeditated racist assault, planned over private chats. This is not the first such attack. And sadly, it may not be the last.”He added, “The government’s failure to generate adequate employment at home has pushed Indian labourers to seek work in Israel. It celebrates Indo-Israel ‘friendship’ when sending Indian labourers there. But when our people face barbaric treatment, it falls silent and shrugs off responsibility.”Tagging Jaishankar, he said the minister “should urgently look into the matter, confirm the victim’s condition, and ensure he has access to adequate, free-of-cost medical care if required.”Khera also questioned whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi would raise the issue during his upcoming visit to Israel. “PM Modi is visiting Israel soon, will he raise the issue of racism and violent attacks against Indian nationals in Israel?” he asked.According to TRT World, the incident comes at a time when India has chosen not to join more than 80 countries that criticised Israeli settlement expansion in the occupied West Bank in a joint statement at the United Nations.Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to visit Israel next week, marking his second trip to the country since 2017.","The two workers were reportedly beaten in Ashkelon, located about 50 km from Tel Aviv.

""We Can’t Be Seen As Weak"": Tharoor’s Bold Claim On Rafale Deal

NEW DELHI: Vice President CP Radhakrishnan on Thursday lamented that contributions of Indian philosophers and social reformers like Sree Narayana Guru have not been adequately recorded in international languages, which has created a gap in global academic discourse.Releasing a book on Narayana Guru by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor , Radhakrishnan said “The sage who reimagined Hinduism” will take India’s heritage to a global audience.The VP said that the book is special because it was first released in Sivagiri Mutt, the hermitage founded by the Guru. He said a visit to the Mutt provides the inspiration to treat everyone with equality and dignity.Radhakrishnan said that the Guru emerged as a spiritual guide at a time when caste divisions and social discrimination were deeply entrenched in society. He noted the Guru’s immortal message “One Caste, One Religion, One God for humankind” was not only a spiritual proclamation but also a revolutionary call for equality, dignity and universal brotherhood.Tharoor said it is unfortunate that while Guru’s message has a universal resonance, he is hardly known outside Kerala . Talking about Kerala of the 19th century, he said that caste prejudices were so deep in the state that Swami Vivekananda had called it a “lunatic asylum”.He said Guru took up social reform in such a bad situation and shook up society to the point that Kerala is now the most progressive state in the country.",Vice President CP Radhakrishnan said contributions of Indian philosophers and social reformers like Sree Narayana Guru have not been adequately recorded in international languages.

Nitai Roy Chowdhury, 77, lone Hindu minister in prime minister Tarique Rahman-led govt and vice-chairman of Bangladesh Nationalist Party's central committee, said his administration was committed to ensuring the safety of all minorities and restoring cordial relations with India, asserting that fundamentalism would not be allowed to spread in Bangladesh.Chowdhury spoke toin an exclusive interview over phone after taking oath as culture minister along with 48 other members, including state ministers, in the cabinet headed by Rahman. He was also among the only four candidates from minority communities, all from BNP, who won in the February 12 elections .Among the 25 newly elected members of National Parliament from BNP who took oath as ministers alongside the newly sworn-in PM, Chowdhury, a party veteran, won from Magura-2 constituency with 1.47 lakh votes, defeating Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami's Mustarshid Billah, who secured 1.17 lakh votes.Referring to the state of governance he inherited, Chowdhury said the previous govt led by Sheikh Hasina had left the country's institutions in tatters. ""Almost everything was in disorder,"" he said, adding that after being elected to form the new govt, it was their duty to bring the country back on track. He said the BNP did not want to indulge in criticism of the past but aimed to move forward with new hopes and dreams to put Bangladesh on the path of development.Explaining what he meant by institutional damage, Chowdhury alleged that when Hasina fled Bangladesh in 2024, the country was ""completely broken"". He claimed the biggest damage was done to the education system, alleging that it had become policy under Awami League to pass 98% of students in examinations irrespective of merit. ""It was done to falsely show that the literacy rate of Bangladesh was increasing along with the passing percentage of students,"" he said.He also accused the previous regime of damaging the country's cultural fabric. During the Awami League govt, he said, ""all sorts of obscene dance and music along with hooliganism were encouraged while pushing our actual cultural values on the backburner."" He said the new govt would work to repair these pillars while upholding the ethos of unity in diversity, which he claimed had been ruined.On apprehensions regarding the safety of minorities, particularly Hindus, amid incidents such as the brutal killing of Dipu Chandra Das and concerns over rising fundamentalism, Chowdhury pointed to what he described as a significant turnout of Hindu voters in the recent elections. He said such turnout was not witnessed in other communities and reflected a shift in political thinking.""Hindus realised that they cannot be treated as mere vote-bank by any party in Bangladesh. They felt that they are an inseparable part of this Bangladesh,"" Chowdhury said, adding that members of the community had businesses, properties and livelihood in the country, with their children studying in local schools, which they could not leave overnight.He said the PM and other BNP leaders met Hindu voters before the elections to assure them of safety and security. ""They realised that they too are independent citizens of this country with equal rights to life and livelihood as mentioned in our constitution. Hence, they voted in large numbers for the BNP, for which we are grateful,"" he said.Chowdhury said most political parties had now realised the importance of Hindus in electoral politics, noting that their support was crucial in at least 80 of the total 297 constituencies in National Parliament. He said that earlier the majority of Hindu voters had supported Awami League, but after its leaders fled the country in 2024, many felt insecure. He credited Rahman with working to remove that fear and win their support.On ties with India, which had taken a hit during the interim govt led by Mohammed Yunus following the toppling of Sheikh Hasina govt in 2024, Chowdhury said it was the new administration's duty to develop good relations with all neighbours, including India. ""We want to have ties which have mutual respect, interest, and understanding,"" he said.""We will work on issues related to internal security of both Bangladesh and India, because we believe that will make a strong base for mutual respect between the two,"" he added.As culture minister, Chowdhury said Bengali culture was rich and that Bangladesh had cultural ties with at least 48 countries, including India. He said the govt would strengthen these ties by focusing on traditions followed by previous generations while fighting fundamentalism and anti-cultural elements. ""We all together will work for a better Bangladesh,"" he said.","Chowdhury spoke toin an exclusive interview over phone after taking oath as culture minister.

It added that multiple surveillances of M/s VSR Ventures — the operator of the aircraft — were carried out across areas such as flight safety systems, flight duty time limitations, maintenance compliance (CAR M and CAR 145), documentation and station facilities and that “all surveillance findings were addressed and closed. ”Following the crash, the ministry directed the DGCA to conduct a Special Audit of M/s VSR Ventures. According to the PIB release, the audit involves a “comprehensive review of regulatory compliance, operational control systems, maintenance practices, crew training standards, safety management systems, and CVR/FDR monitoring.”The audit commenced on February 4 and is expected to conclude shortly, with findings to be reviewed and action taken in accordance with DGCA’s Enforcement Policy and Procedures Manual.The ministry also asked the DGCA to carry out special audits of other major non-scheduled operators and aerodromes engaged in VIP/VVIP operations.

‘Targeting People Like Terrorists’: Mamata Banerjee Attacks EC Over SIR, Cites Bangladesh Polls

NEW DELHI: Amid a political row over alleged restrictions on the open sale of fish and meat in Bihar, West Bengal BJP president Samik Bhattacharya on Thursday asserted that people in Bengal are free to consume the food of their choice and clarified that the party is only opposed to the open sale of beef.The controversy began after senior Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders, including West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, criticised what they described as a BJP-backed move against non-vegetarian food habits. The remarks were linked to a recent order by the Bihar government regulating the open sale of meat.Responding to the allegations, Bhattacharya said, “People in Bengal will eat whatever they want to eat. Bengal will have its fish and meat,” rejecting claims by the TMC of a proposed ban on fish and meat sales in the open in the neighbouring state.Elaborating on the Bihar directive, he added that the BJP had not proposed any blanket restriction. “They can never utter such a thing. Why should they? None will accept it. The TMC is twisting the comments,” he said.Bhattacharya further stated that no such ban exists and that people in Bihar or West Bengal would not abide by it if such a measure were introduced, news agency PTI reported.Drawing a distinction, he maintained that the BJP’s stand was limited to opposing the open sale of beef. “Only that stuff you sell in the open will not be allowed by the BJP,” he said.Earlier, Mamata Banerjee had raised concerns over the reported directive in Bihar, pointing to the livelihood impact on small traders.She said, “I came across a report about the Bihar deputy chief minister asserting that fish and meat cannot be sold in the open market. This is anti-people and condemnable. Can everyone sell meat and fish in shopping malls? What will happen to the majority of fish and meat sellers on the road? What about their livelihood issue? Such politics is deplorable.”Addressing the issue again, Banerjee alleged, “If BJP comes to power, they would ban meat and fish in Bengal. I saw Bihar's deputy CM say that fish and meat can't be sold in open markets. Only those who have a licence can sell meat indoors. So, will everyone sell meat and fish in shopping malls? Only a few have the economic strength to do so. Most fish sellers sell fresh fish on the streets here. This is how they earn their bread. I condemn this politics.”","West Bengal BJP president Samik Bhattacharya says people in Bengal are free to consume the food of their choice.

‘No Vikas Agenda’: PM Modi Targets Congress Over BMC Polls, Warns Of ‘Infiltrators’ At Assam Rally

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Thursday released a 20-point “chargesheet” against the BJP-led Assam government, accusing chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma of corruption and using state machinery to create fear among minorities.The chargesheet was unveiled in Guwahati ahead of the upcoming elections to the 126-member Assam Assembly. The Congress alleged that the BJP government had failed to fulfil key promises made during its decade-long tenure.Among the issues raised, the party said that the government did not grant Scheduled Tribe (ST) status to six indigenous communities as promised. It also alleged that the BJP had failed to increase the daily wages of tea garden workers to Rs 351.The Congress further accused the state government of “rampant corruption,” claiming that the CM, some of his close ministers and their family members had “accumulated wealth illegally.” The chargesheet also alleged that the government engaged in “bulldozer justice” and carried out selective evictions targeting minorities, according to news agency PTI.Priyanka Gandhi, who is chairperson of the Congress screening committee for the Assam polls, is on a two-day visit to the state to finalise the party’s list of candidates.She was received at the airport by Assam Congress president Gaurav Gogoi and other senior leaders.Soon after arriving, she visited the revered Kamakhya Temple atop the Nilachal Hills to offer prayers. “I sought the blessings of Maa Kamakhya, and I am feeling very good after offering prayers at the temple,” she told reporters.Speaking about the party’s preparations, Gandhi said that she would personally meet party leaders and workers to gather feedback before distributing tickets.“I am meeting everyone and taking their suggestions and feedback. That is what we will do for two days, trying to meet as many people individually as we can. Members of the screening committee have been going to every district. They will take feedback and then assess it. Our efforts are to distribute the tickets well and contest the elections strongly,” she said.When asked about alliance talks, she said people should “wait and watch what happens.”Meanwhile, CM Sarma expressed confidence that the BJP would return to power in the state under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Addressing a BJP ‘Booth Vijay Sankalp Sabha’ in Guwahati, Sarma highlighted development initiatives in Assam, including the recently approved underwater tunnel in the Brahmaputra River connecting Gohpur and Numaligarh. He described it as “an unimaginable gift to Assam.”“This time we will win, by making a record.

Hinduism vs Hindutva: TMC MP Mahua Moitra’s 'Love Jihad' Remark Ignites Fierce Political Debate

What the case is about?

NEW DELHI: Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Mahua Moitra on Thursday moved the Delhi high court seeking custody of her pet Rottweiler, Henry.The petition challenges a November 10 last year's order of a Saket court which had refused her request for 10-day custody of the dog every month.Justice Manoj Kumar Ohri issued notice to Moitra's ex-partner and advocate Jai Anant Dehadrai seeing his response to the plea. The matter has been listed for hearing on April 29.Moitra has argued that the lower court’s order is “bad in law and fact.” In her plea, she stated that Henry primarily resided with her, except when she travelled outside Delhi for official duties in her constituency. During such periods, the dog stayed with Dehadrai.Advocate Jai Anant Dehadrai appeared in person before the high court and submitted that the petition should be dismissed at the outset (in limine), according to news agency ANI.The custody dispute over the Rottweiler has been pending before the Saket court. Last year in September, the Delhi high court had issued notice to Moitra on an appeal filed by Dehadrai against a trial court order, which had directed him not to publicise the matter.Justice Manoj Jain had then asked Moitra to file her response, while senior advocate Sanjoy Ghosh appeared for Dehadrai. According to the plea, Moitra had earlier filed a custody suit against Dehadrai over the pet dog, Henry, which was purchased by him in 2021.The case will now be heard on April 29.The legal dispute between Mahua Moitra and advocate Jai Anant Dehadrai stems from a personal fallout that later escalated into multiple public and legal confrontations.Moitra and Dehadrai were reportedly in a relationship and jointly owned a Rottweiler named Henry. However, after their relationship turned bitter and amid Dehadrai’s public allegations against Moitra in the ‘cash-for-query’ controversy, the custody of Henry became a central point of dispute. Both claimed ownership of the dog and accused the other of unlawfully taking him.Dehadrai has claimed that he purchased Henry in 2021 for Rs 75,000 and had been caring for him since the dog was 40 days old. Moitra, on the other hand, alleged that Dehadrai trespassed into her residence and took Henry without her consent.As the custody battle reached the Saket court, the trial court directed both parties to “ensure that the present proceedings shall not be publicised in any manner.” Dehadrai challenged this direction, arguing that the “sweeping gag order” prevented him from even disclosing the existence of the case in the public domain.",The petition challenges a November 10 last year's order of a Saket court which had refused her request for 10-day custody of the dog every month. Justice Manoj Kumar Ohri issued notice to Moitra's ex-partner and advocate Jai Anant Dehadrai. The matter has been listed for hearing on April 29.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128556713,imgsize-1245279,width-400,resizemode-4/128556713.jpg"

HYDERABAD: A 16-year-old schoolgirl missing from her home in Narsingi since Monday was found confined to a flat in Chengicherla and raped by three, including two juveniles. Police rescued her on Wednesday.The 24-year-old accused, who has a suspect sheet against him, has been sent to jail and one of the minors has been remanded in a juvenile home. Third accused is on the run.The survivor, a Class 8 student, was familiar with the arrested juvenile who worked as a salesperson at a footwear shop in Charminar. She had first met him on Feb 7 and later stayed in touch over the phone. On Feb 16, after school, she went to Madina to meet him.Later in the evening, the two other accused joined them and took the girl to an empty apartment in Chengicherla. There, the three allegedly assaulted her and forced her to consume alcohol at knife point.""During medical examination it was found that the survivor suffered injuries to her private parts,"" police said.The matter came to light when the survivor's mother approached police to file a missing person's report early on Tuesday.She said the minor, who lived with her maternal grandmother in a housing society in Narsingi, where the grandmother works as a caretaker, left for school at 8 am on Monday but did not return home.""My daughter usually gets home by 4 pm. But when she did not come back, my mother alerted us. We rushed from Shaheen Nagar to her place and searched for her in the surrounding areas. We also made enquiries with relatives and her friends, but could not locate her,"" the girl's mother stated in her complaint.Based on the complaint, police registered a kidnapping case under section 137(2) of BNS and started an investigation.Using CCTV footage, mobile phone data and local inputs, police traced the girl and two suspects to a govt double-bedroom flat in Chengicherla.""The 24-year-old accused is a habitual offender with eight previous cases, including robbery, theft and assault.

'Ambition and narcissism' -



Washington: President Donald Trump on Thursday promised $10 billion for a new ""Board of Peace,"" an amorphous new institution focused first on Gaza that is being launched just as he threatens Iran with war.While US warplanes and aircraft carriers headed toward Iran on his orders, Trump welcomed some two dozen allies from around the world to the gleaming Washington building of the former US Institute of Peace, which has been gutted and renamed after the 79-year-old Republican.Trump, who has sharply curtailed foreign aid, said that the United States would contribute $10 billion to the initiative whose goals include rebuilding Gaza, which was reduced to rubble by two years of war between Hamas and Israel.""Together we can achieve the dream of bringing lasting harmony to a region tortured by centuries of war, suffering,"" said the realtor-turned-president, who has previously spoken improbably of building tourist resorts in Gaza.Trump did not explain exactly where the money would go and his ""Board of Peace"" has drawn wide criticism for its opaque nature.Trump will wield veto power over the ""Board of Peace"" and can remain its head even after leaving office, while countries that want to stay on permanently rather than enjoy a two-year stint will need to pay $1 billion.In a rambling speech in which he denounced domestic opponents, highlighted stock market gains and hailed his prowess in endorsing foreign leaders during elections, Trump said he wanted to pursue more peace deals.""It's all about an easy word to say, but a hard word to produce -- peace,"" Trump said.The meeting comes two days after Trump sent two envoys to speak with Iran's top diplomat as the United States pushes for major concessions from the cleric-run state on concerns starting with its nuclear program.""We have to make a meaningful deal otherwise bad things happen,"" Trump said.He warned that Washington ""may have to take it a step further"" without any agreement, adding: ""You're going to be finding out over the next probably 10 days.""The ""Board of Peace"" came together after the Trump administration, teaming up with Qatar and Egypt, negotiated a ceasefire in October to halt two years of devastating war in Gaza.The United States says that the plan has now entered its second phase with a focus on disarming Hamas -- the Palestinian militant group whose unprecedented October 7, 2023, attack on Israel triggered the massive offensive.Gaza's health ministry, which operates under Hamas authorities, says at least 601 people have been killed by Israeli forces since the truce began.The meeting will also look at how to launch the International Stabilization Force that will ensure security in Gaza.A key player will be Indonesia, the largest Muslim-majority country, which has said it is ready to send up to 8,000 troops to Gaza if the force is confirmed.Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto -- a former general once accused of human rights abuses whom Trump called a ""tough cookie"" -- will take part in the inaugural meeting in Gaza, after joining the launch event at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last month.Israel was represented by its foreign minister, who was positioned at a group photo next to the prime minister of Qatar, which has faced intense criticism from Israel.In one step towards a new Gaza, a technocratic committee was formed last month to handle day-to-day governance of Gaza headed by engineer and former official Ali Shaath.The inaugural meeting brought ideological allies of Trump including Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who is facing a tough reelection battle, and Argentina's President Javier Millei.Other leaders in attendance include some eager for US attention, such as Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif , who has courted Trump for support in his country's conflict with India.Critics say that the ""Board of Peace"" remains vague, including how it would interact with existing institutions including the United Nations.""It's a confused mix of ambition and narcissism, unleavened by any effort at intellectual coherence,"" said Bruce Jones, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.","Trump promises $10 billion for a new ""Board of Peace,"" an amorphous new institution.

'This is a national crisis'





A day after a 64-year-old man was killed in Indiana in a crash caused by a negligent truck driver who ran a red light, reports claimed that the truck driver had been identified as Singh Sukhdeep who received his commercial driver's license from Indiana in May 2025. There has been no official confirmation about the driver's identity. Fox News correspondent Bill Melugin claimed that federal sources confirmed that Singh was caught and released at the border in 2018 when he was a minor by the first Trump administration. Singh is now under ICE custody, Melugin claimed.The crash took place Wednesday on US 36 at the road's intersection with County Road 525 East -- involving three vehicles.A Freightliner semi-truck with a trailer was reportedly travelling eastbound on US 36 when it allegedly ran the red light at the intersection. The truck reportedly struck a Chevrolet truck travelling northbound. The Chevrolet struck a Chrysler that was in the left turn lane traveling westbound on US 36. The Chevrolet occupant, 64-year-old Terry Schultz, was pronounced dead at the scene.One driver was detained by ICE. No other details were revealed Wednesday.On Thursday, the Department of Homeland Security released a statement condemning the practise of giving illegal aliens driving licenses. “This tragedy comes less than two weeks after another illegal alien driving a semi truck killed four innocent people in Indiana,” the statement read. “It is incredibly dangerous for illegal aliens, who often don’t know our traffic laws or even English, to be operating semi-trucks on America’s roads. These tragedies are 100% preventable and we pray for the family and victim.”The incident came at a time when Indian-origin truck drivers in the US are on the radar and the Donald Trump administration blames the Biden administration for leniency in policy.Indiana senator Jim Banks responded to Melugin's post and said it had become a national crisis. ""Another life taken on Indiana roads by a semitruck driver who never should have been here or behind the wheel in the first place,"" the senator wrote.""How many times are we going to see this same story happen again? It feels like every single week there is another family planning a funeral because illegals who can’t read our road signs and don’t follow our laws are allowed on our highways.""""This is not bad luck. This is not just another accident. This is a national crisis! I am sick of it. We need real accountability and a major overhaul. I’m calling on the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration to investigate chameleon carrier networks in Indiana and will be introducing legislation to get unsafe, illegal drivers off our roads before another life is lost and another family gets destroyed,"" the senator added.",A 64-year-old man was killed in Indiana in a crash caused by a negligent truck driver who ran a red light.

Trade secrets stolen for former Google engineer

What Google said



A former Google engineer, along with her husband and sister, has been charged in the United States for allegedly stealing trade secrets linked to Google’s Tensor processor, which powers Pixel smartphones. According to a Bloomberg report, Samaneh Ghandali, 41 is an Iranian national and previously worked as a hardware engineer at Google in Silicon Valley. Her sister, Soroor Ghandali, 32, was once an intern at the company. Both later joined another technology firm. Samaneh’s husband, Mohammadjavad Khosravi, 40, applied several times for jobs at Google but was not hired and instead worked for a separate tech company.The case was filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California. US authorities said the case involves confidential hardware information taken from Google while the accused were working or seeking work in the tech industry. The Justice Department said the trade secrets were related to Google’s in-house Tensor processor used in Pixel phones.All three accused were charged with 14 felony counts, including conspiracy, theft of trade secrets, and destruction of evidence.The three were arrested on Thursday, February 19 and appeared in federal court in San Jose, California. If found guilty, they could face up to 20 years in prison.As per the Bloomberg report, Google said it took quick action after discovering the incident. “We have enhanced safeguards to protect our confidential information and immediately alerted law enforcement after discovering this incident,” a Google spokesperson said.Last month, another former Google software engineer Linwei Ding, also known as Leon Ding, 38 was convicted on seven counts of economic espionage and seven counts of theft of trade secrets for stealing thousands of pages of confidential information containing Google’s trade secrets related to artificial intelligence technology for the benefit of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). The jury’s verdict follows an 11-day trial before US District Judge Vince Chhabria for the Northern District of California.“This conviction exposes a calculated breach of trust involving some of the most advanced AI technology in the world at a critical moment in AI development,” said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John A. Eisenberg. “Ding abused his privileged access to steal AI trade secrets while pursuing PRC government-aligned ventures. His duplicity put U.S. technological leadership and competitiveness at risk. I commend the trial team and investigators whose exceptional work resulted in this conviction.”","Samaneh Ghandali, 41, is an Iranian national and previously worked as a hardware engineer at Google in Silicon Valley.

Opposition raises issue in Assembly

Supreme Court order cited

Continued disagreement





LUCKNOW: The Uttar Pradesh government has clarified its stand on the use of loudspeakers in mosques during the holy month of Ramzan, stating that existing Supreme Court directives on sound restrictions remain applicable.According to news agency PTI, the issue was raised in the state Assembly during Zero Hour by Samajwadi Party member Kamal Akhtar, who urged the government to allow mosques to make announcements for ‘sehri’ and ‘iftar’.Ramzan commenced on Thursday.Akhtar said that festivals of all religions — including Holi, Diwali, Dussehra, Kanwar Yatra as well as Christian and Sikh celebrations — are observed in the state, and mosques should similarly be allowed to use loudspeakers during Ramzan.He said brief announcements are traditionally made from mosques to inform people observing fast about the timings of ‘sehri’ (pre-dawn meal) and ‘iftar’ (meal to break the fast).Akhtar also claimed that the government recently removed loudspeakers from most religious places, and urged it to permit mosque announcements during Ramzan to provide relief to people.Responding to the issue, Finance and Parliamentary affairs minister Suresh Kumar Khanna said the Supreme Court has clearly directed that loudspeakers should not be used after 10 pm.The Supreme Court prohibits the use of loudspeakers, public address systems, and sound-producing instruments from 10 pm to 6 am, except in closed premises such as auditoriums, conference rooms, and banquet halls for internal communication.Khanna said that even at weddings, police ensure compliance if complaints are received about loudspeakers being used beyond the stipulated time.Referring to the tradition of mosque announcements for ‘sehri’ and ‘iftar’, Khanna said the practice originated when clocks were not common and people estimated time by the position of the sun.“Today, almost every person – whether a rickshaw puller, street vendor or vegetable seller – has a mobile phone that shows time. So the necessity is no longer there,” he said.He added that while the government does not interfere in anyone's religious beliefs, the Supreme Court has laid down the rules on the use of loudspeakers, and “it is not our order”.Akhtar maintained that the apex court order relates to sound levels and does not prohibit the use of loudspeakers, and urged the minister to allow the announcements during Ramzan.The minister did not offer any further reply.","The Uttar Pradesh government has clarified its stand on the use of loudspeakers in mosques during the holy month of Ramzan.

The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) reportedly released a video purportedly showing Pakistani Army personnel in its custody, as a self-declared deadline for a proposed prisoner exchange continues to run.In the footage circulated on social media, shared by region's independent online news portal Balochistan Post, citing the group’s official channel Hakkal, several men appear on camera displaying what they say are official service cards and national identity documents. The individuals, identified by the BLA as detained servicemen, are heard appealing to Pakistani authorities. They claim that they were formally recruited, issued official documentation, and assigned postings, while questioning why authorities are allegedly refusing to acknowledge them.In the video, a soldier can be seen pleading to the Pakistan Army for help. ""How can the army say that we are not their personnel? Whose card is this [showing supposed identitiy card]?It's the Army's right? Look at my identity card, Pakistan also issued this to me,"" a soldier can be heard saying. Continuing his pleas, he addes, ""I request for God's sake, my father is disabled and I am the eldest at home. Do not commit this injustice by saying that we're not your personnel.Then why did you recruit me if you're going to say that we're not your personnel? Why are you saying the video is fake?""However, critiques have raised questions over the authenticity of the video.The video release comes against the backdrop of a seven-day deadline previously announced by the BLA for a prisoner exchange involving individuals it described as “prisoners of war.” The group added that three days remain before the deadline expires.The development follows recent statements by the BLA asserting that it had captured multiple Pakistani military personnel during coordinated attacks across Balochistan. The group referred to the operations as “Operation Herof 2.0.”Pakistani authorities have not officially confirmed the claims. There has been no statement from government or military spokespersons regarding the number of personnel allegedly held, nor any formal response to the BLA’s proposed exchange or deadline.","Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) reportedly released a video purportedly showing Pakistani Army personnel in its custody.

Cigarette Ignition Sparks Fires at Raipur Petrol Pump: Two Men Arrested,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/cctv-shocker-told-not-to-smoke-while-refuelling-man-sparks-inferno-at-petrol-pump/articleshow/128585462.cms,"



RAIPUR: A puff of cigarette nearly turned into a fireball at Chhattisgarh's Raipur petrol pump after a youth allegedly set a fuel nozzle ablaze using a lighter when asked not to smoke, that triggered flames on a motorcycle and pump. Amid panic, the pump staff averted a major disaster and doused it with a fire extinguisher.The incident took place at a petrol pump in the Urla area on Thursday evening. According to police, two men identified as Dharmendra Kshatri and Imran had arrived at the pump on a motorcycle to refuel.Police said Imran remained seated on the bike while Dharmendra stood nearby. As the fuel tank was opened, Dharmendra allegedly took out a cigarette and tried to light it. When he was asked to stop smoking at the petrol pump, he became enraged and used a lighter to ignite the fuel nozzle pipe, triggering flames.The fire quickly spread to the bike’s fuel tank and the pump machine, causing panic at the site. The two accused, the biker and pump staff rushed away to save themselves as flames flared up.Officials said a pump attendant acted swiftly, pulling away the fuel pipe and switching off the main fuel supply.Using the fire safety kit available at the pump, the staff managed to douse the flames in time, preventing what could have been a major explosion or fire accident.During the chaos, some burning fuel reportedly splashed on the accused as well. After the incident, the duo attempted to flee but were caught by pump staff, who informed the police and lodged a complaint.Urla police later arrested both accused based on the complaint by the pump manager and CCTV footage from the site. Urla inspector Rohit Mahelkar said a case has been registered under sections related to arson and endangering public safety.Police said the quick response by petrol pump employees prevented a potentially catastrophic incident, as the fire could have spread to nearby vehicles and fuel storage areas.","A puff of cigarette nearly turned into a fireball at Chhattisgarh's Raipur petrol pump.

Iran has warned the United States of retaliation if subjected to military aggression, saying all US bases and assets in the region would become “legitimate targets” in such a scenario.In a strongly worded letter addressed to the UN secretary general, António Guterres, and members of the security council, Iran accused the United States of issuing unlawful threats of force and urged the Council to act “without delay” to prevent further escalation.While reiterating that it “neither seeks tension nor war” and will not initiate any conflict, Iran made clear that it would respond if attacked.“In the event that it is subjected to military aggression, Iran will respond decisively and proportionately in the exercise of its inherent right of self-defence under Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations,” the letter stated.It added that in such circumstances, “all bases, facilities, and assets of the hostile force in the region would constitute legitimate targets” as part of Iran’s defensive response. Tehran said the United States would bear “full and direct responsibility” for any “unpredictable and uncontrolled consequences.”Iran urged the security council to use its authority and good offices to ensure that the US ""immediately ceases its unlawful threats of the use of force.""Tehran also said it noted that it has engaged “constructively, with seriousness and in good faith” in nuclear talks with the US.The warning to the UN comes against a backdrop of rising military posturing and hardening rhetoric on both sides.On Thursday, Iran conducted its annual military drills with Russia, even as a second US aircraft carrier moved closer to the Middle East — a visible reminder of the growing strategic pressure in the region. The developments have underscored the fragile situation between both Washington and Tehran, as the two nations signal that they are prepared for conflict if nuclear negotiations collapse.US President Donald Trump has repeatedly cautioned Iran that failure to reach a deal would carry consequences. In his latest remarks, he suggested the window for diplomacy may be closing fast, saying he believes 10 to 15 days is “enough time” for Iran to reach an agreement.“It’s proven to be, over the years, not easy to make a meaningful deal with Iran, and we have to make a meaningful deal. Otherwise, bad things happen,” Trump said on Thursday.While there has been no official indication of imminent military action, the convergence of diplomatic deadlines, visible force deployments and escalating rhetoric has kept tensions high, placing US-Iran relations under intense international scrutiny.","Iran has warned the United States of retaliation if subjected to military aggression.

‘It’s True But…’: Barack Obama’s First Response After ALIEN Remark Sparks Big Debate | Full Detail





US president Donald Trump on Thursday announced that he's ordering the release of classified files on UFOs and aliens, while accusing former president Barack Obama of releasing classified info.""Based on the tremendous interest shown, I will be directing the Secretary of War, and other relevant Departments and Agencies, to begin the process of identifying and releasing Government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters. GOD BLESS AMERICA!"" said Trump on TruthSocial.Trump's remarks came hours after he accused former President Barack Obama of disclosing “classified information” over remarks suggesting aliens might be real. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump said, “I don’t know if they’re real or not,"" and added about Obama, “I may get him out of trouble by declassifying.”Former President Barack Obama, who made the remarks during a podcast appearance over the weekend, later clarified that he had not seen evidence that aliens “have made contact with us.” He added, however, “statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there’s life out there.”Trump also addressed the subject on Thursday, telling reporters: “I don’t have an opinion on it. I never talk about it. A lot of people do. A lot of people believe it.”Trump’s daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, suggested this week that he may weigh in more directly. Speaking on a podcast, she said the president had prepared a speech on aliens that he would deliver at the “right time.”That claim drew an amused response from the White House. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt laughed when asked about it on Wednesday, saying, “A speech on aliens would be news to me.”Public fascination with unidentified flying objects resurfaced after former Pentagon and government officials leaked Navy videos of unknown aerial objects to The New York Times and Politico in 2017. The renewed attention led Congress to hold its first UFO hearings in 50 years in May 2022. Officials later said the objects seen in widely discussed footage, green triangular shapes hovering above a Navy ship, were likely drones.Amid growing scrutiny, the Pentagon pledged greater transparency. In July 2022, it established the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), tasked with centralising reports of unidentified aerial phenomena.In 2023, AARO’s then-director Sean Kirkpatrick said he had found no evidence “of any program having ever existed” to conduct reverse engineering of extraterrestrial technology.Available public data indicates that while many military UFO sightings remain unresolved, identified cases have largely involved routine objects. An 18-page unclassified report submitted to Congress in June 2024 noted 485 reports of unidentified phenomena over the previous year, with 118 attributed to “prosaic objects such as various types of balloons, birds, and unmanned aerial systems.”",US president Donald Trump announced that he's ordering the release of classified files on UFOs and aliens.

Youth-targeted programmes that encourage legal literacy and responsible behaviour among teenage drivers





In an assertive bid to curb reckless driving and youth-related offenses, Kuwait i authorities have wrapped up a major nationwide security and traffic safety campaign that resulted in 45 reckless drivers arrested and 19 juveniles referred to legal authorities over recent days. The Ministry of Interior (MoI) led the effort, combining traffic police units, patrols and intelligence resources to enforce road laws more strictly and address growing concerns about public safety on Kuwait’s streets. The campaign reflects a broader strategy to tackle irresponsible behaviour that has been linked to fatalities, property damage and escalating public unease.Authorities underscored that the intensified enforcement was not arbitrary but rather a measured response to statistics and community complaints showing a rise in dangerous driving behaviours, such as excessive speeding, illegal drifting, ignoring traffic signals and other violations that increase the risk of accidents. By focusing on these priorities, the campaign aims to protect both residents and visitors and reinforce respect for the rule of law in one of the Gulf’s busiest urban landscapes.Between coastal highways and urban thoroughfares, traffic officers across all governorates took part in concentrated enforcement efforts that targeted both habitual offenders and spontaneous infractions. According to reports from the Ministry, 45 drivers were detained for recklessness, including cases where drivers performed stunts, engaged in dangerous manoeuvres and blatantly violated traffic rules in ways that threatened other road users.The campaign also saw violations recorded for:By arresting offenders on the spot, police aimed not only to punish unsafe behaviour but also to set a visible deterrent example for others who might consider risky driving a casual indulgence rather than a serious public hazard.Officials emphasised that reckless driving is a leading contributor to traffic accidents in Kuwait and remains a priority enforcement area for the MoI. Through targeted campaigns, authorities hope to drive lasting cultural change and reduce the rate of crash-related injuries and fatalities that have burdened families and emergency services in recent years.In tandem with the traffic crackdown, 19 juveniles were referred to legal authorities over various infractions observed during the campaign. While specific details about each case were not disclosed, juveniles are often referred when implicated in:The referral of juveniles underscores another dimension of the MoI’s strategy, one that recognises the need for responsible legal and social intervention rather than just punitive measures. In many jurisdictions, including Kuwait, juveniles referred to authorities may undergo rehabilitative programs, legal guidance or supervision designed to help them avoid deeper involvement with crime as they mature.Community observers and youth advocates in Kuwait have noted that such referrals, paired with educational initiatives, can be a meaningful way to steer young people away from habits and circles that normalise high-risk behaviour.Kuwait is not alone in grappling with traffic safety challenges. Across the Gulf region, countries have repeatedly cited road accidents and reckless driving as key social concerns. Expatriate and local drivers alike contribute to diverse driving cultures, and authorities have responded with rigorous campaigns, fines, vehicle impounds and awareness programmes.For example:In Kuwait’s case, the recent arrests were all publicly announced and serve a dual purpose: improving safety statistics and signalling to the community that traffic enforcement is a sustained priority, not just a periodic campaign.Road safety is a public health priority. Traffic accidents remain a significant cause of injury and death in many countries and Kuwait has seen its share of serious collisions tied to reckless behaviour. By targeting high-risk drivers, law enforcement hopes to reduce not only violations but accident rates and emergency hospital admissions. Behavioural norms are at stake. Public perceptions matter. When drivers regularly see enforcement in action, especially arrests on the spot, it reinforces a cultural expectation that compliance with traffic laws is non-negotiable, not optional. This can help reduce risky driving over time.Youth involvement signals community concern. That juveniles were among those referred indicates that dangerous behaviour is not confined to adult drivers. Addressing youth conduct early can prevent risk escalation and steer teens and young adults toward safer habits and legal awareness. Enforcement changes public behaviour. Traffic campaigns create visible deterrence, signalling to would-be violators that authorities are actively watching and ready to take action, a dynamic that can be more effective than fines alone.Social media reaction to the campaign has been mixed but generally supportive of stricter enforcement, especially among those who have witnessed reckless driving firsthand. Many users praised the MoI for taking a firm approach, noting that enforcement was long overdue and speeds in Kedah, Hawally and other busy districts often felt out of control.Some commentators also pointed to the need for complementary measures, such as:The interplay between law enforcement and community engagement is increasingly recognised as key to long-term behavioural change. While the recent campaign has made headlines for arrests and juvenile referrals, authorities have indicated that enforcement will be sustained and possibly expanded. Possible future priorities might include:The MoI’s overall message is clear: lawful behaviour and public safety are non-negotiable, and drivers of all ages must respect traffic laws if they wish to avoid legal penalties and contribute to a safer environment for everyone. Kuwait’s nationwide campaign resulted in 45 reckless drivers arrested and 19 juveniles referred for investigation. The crackdown focused on dangerous driving behaviours, traffic violations and youth-linked incidents. Authorities aim to improve public safety, road compliance and cultural norms around driving. The initiative is part of broader regional efforts to address traffic-related fatalities and irresponsible behaviour. Public reaction has been mostly supportive, with calls for complementary education alongside enforcement.","45 reckless drivers arrested and 19 juveniles referred to legal authorities over recent days.

Iran fortifies key facilities



Strategic stakes and regional impact







The United States has deployed the most substantial military force to the Middle East since the 2003 invasion of Iraq, raising fears of imminent strikes against Iran as President Donald Trump weighs his options. Sources familiar with the matter told CNN that the US military could be ready to launch attacks as early as this weekend, although Trump has yet to make a final decision. The president has reportedly polled advisers and foreign leaders, weighing both the risks of military action and the potential gains of further diplomacy.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt emphasised on Wednesday that while diplomacy remains Trump’s “first option,” military action remains firmly on the table. “There’s many reasons and arguments that one could make for a strike against Iran,” she said, adding that the president relies heavily on counsel from his national security team. Negotiations continue: US and Iranian officials met in Geneva this week for indirect talks, agreeing on a “set of guiding principles,” though key details remain unresolved, CBS reported.The military buildup includes 13 US warships already stationed in the Middle East, including the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, nine destroyers, and three littoral combat ships.A second carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford—the world’s largest—has been ordered from the Caribbean and is expected to arrive within weeks, accompanied by three destroyers.Air power is also surging. Advanced F-22 and F-35 fighter jets, F-15 and F-16 warplanes, and KC-135 aerial refuelling aircraft have been repositioned closer to Iran, with command-and-control planes arriving to coordinate a potential sustained air campaign. Flight-tracking data shows E-3 Sentry airborne warning and control aircraft and other support planes operating in the region, laying the foundation for operations that could extend for weeks, rather than a single strike.“This presence of so much firepower in the region creates a momentum of its own,” said Susan Ziadeh, senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Sometimes that momentum is a little hard to just put the brakes on and say, that’s it, we’re not doing anything.”Meanwhile, Iran has intensified defensive preparations. Satellite imagery analysed by the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) and reported by Reuters shows the construction of concrete shields over sensitive facilities, including the Taleghan 2 site near Parchin. Tunnel entrances at the Isfahan nuclear complex have been buried in soil, while sites near Natanz are being hardened. Iranian missile bases in Shiraz South and Qom are also being rebuilt after last year’s strikes by Israel.Experts warn that these measures could complicate any US air campaign. “Backfilling the tunnel entrances would help dampen potential airstrikes and make ground access difficult,” said William Goodhind, a forensic imagery analyst with Contested Ground, as reported by Reuters. ISIS founder David Albright noted that Iran’s recent activity “may soon become a fully unrecognisable bunker, providing significant protection from aerial strikes. ”US officials told The Wall Street Journal that President Trump has been briefed on options ranging from limited strikes on nuclear and missile facilities to broader operations targeting regime leaders and regional proxies. Long-range bombers, including B-2s, could be deployed directly from the US or from Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, as Trump has hinted on social media.Iran, heavily reliant on its missile arsenal and lacking a significant air force, could respond by targeting US bases and allies or attempting to close the Strait of Hormuz. Analysts, including retired Air Force General David Deptula, suggest that the military buildup might itself push Tehran toward concessions: “The dramatic increase in deployed forces may be significant enough that Trump is not messing around with the use of force,” he said.","US has deployed the most substantial military force to the Middle East since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

Russia Offers To Take Iran’s Enriched Uranium As Trump Sets 15-Day Deadline For Potential Deal





In recent weeks, the US military has built up forces close to Iran, in what President Trump has referred to as an ""armada."" The armada includes the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln, which is accompanied by three warships that are equipped with Tomahawk missiles and that were used to strike two of Iran's nuclear facilities last June. The warships also carry air defences. The carrier's stealthy F-35 fighters and F/A-18 attack planes are well within striking distance of dozens of targets in Iran.The US recently ordered a second aircraft carrier strike group to the region. This includes the navy's most advanced aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R Ford, and three of its accompanying destroyers. On Wednesday, they were on course to Strait of Gibraltar, according to flight and ship-tracking data reviewed by NYT.Additionally, another destroyer was sent to the Northern Arabian Sea, and one is en route, according to an official, bringing the total in the wider region to 13 destroyers. The Muwaffaq Salti Air Base in Jordan appears to have become a central node for the US assets of the buildup. At least two waves of attack aircraft arrived between mid-Jan and mid-Feb, bringing the number to nearly 30.In addition to the attack aircraft, four electronic warfare jets, which are used to jam radar and communications systems, arrived in Jordan at the end of Jan. And a Jan 30 satellite image showed at least five MQ-9 Reaper drones at the base.And the Pentagon has dispatched more Patriot and THAAD air defenses to help protect troops there from Iranian missiles. There are 30,000 to 40,000 US troops in the region.

‘Brown sepoy syndrome’: Startup founder's remarks on Indian-Americans adopting accents spark social media storm,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/brown-sepoy-syndrome-startup-founders-remarks-on-indian-americans-adopting-accents-spark-social-media-storm/articleshow/128576932.cms,"



A social media post by Indian entrepreneur Devaiah Bopanna has ignited a heated debate online after he questioned why some Indian-Americans, particularly high-profile CEOs and founders, appear to adopt American accents while many long-term Indian residents in the US do not.In a post that quickly gained traction on X, Bopanna reflected on his own circle of engineering friends who moved to the United States for their master’s degrees between 2008-2013 and have been living there for nearly two decades. Despite spending what he described as “about 18 years” in the country, “nearly half your speaking life” many of them, he noted, still speak without a noticeable American accent.Bopanna, co-founder of Moonshot and content head at Superteam, contrasted this with the Indian-American bankers, engineers, CEOs and founders frequently seen speaking at global summits and industry panels, many of whom, he observed, speak with a distinct Indian-American accent.He went on to ask whether picking up an accent is a ""conscious choice"" aimed at professional advancement or social acceptance. ""How can so many people not have accents and so many people do?"" he wrote, further questioning whether accent shifts are a natural adaptation process where individuals have “no control over their accents,” or a deliberate decision.While the post appeared to stem from personal curiosity, it quickly spiraled into a wider NRIs versus Indians debate in the replies.An Indian-origin Harvard graduate based in Pittsburgh swiftly explained the entire question as a matter of ""code-switching."" He claimed picking up an accent was as much about becoming ""intelligible to the average co-worker"" as it was about ""fitting in."" Additionally, he pointed out that if one has a majority of Indian coworkers and clients, then ""you probably never need to code-switch.""Another Indian-origin man who claimed to have lived in the West, including America for ""more than a decade,"" added that his accent ""did not change a bit"" and he did not feel the need to fake his accent ""like these people do.""Adding that he had seen people live in the US for a year and pick up an accent, describing the tendency as ""brown Sepoy syndrome."" The term, relatively new on the internet, is used to describe the silent withdrawal of Indians in the West, a mindset of surrender where survival and gratitude has turned into mental servitude.The debate comes amid heightened tensions surrounding immigration and identity politics in the United States. Since January 2025, under the renewed Trump administration, Indian-Americans — particularly those connected to the H-1B visa system — have faced intensified scrutiny and criticism. At the same time, some Indians on social media have criticised members of the diaspora for leaving the country in pursuit of opportunities abroad.According to a report by the Center for the Study of Organized Hate, posts on X containing anti-Indian slurs, stereotypes, or calls to “deport Indians” amassed 280 million views over a two-month period in 2025, underscoring a broader surge in anti-Indian rhetoric online.What began as a question about accents has thus unfolded into a larger conversation about assimilation, professional identity and belonging in an increasingly polarised climate.","Indian entrepreneur Devaiah Bopanna questioned why some Indian-Americans appear to adopt American accents.

A video of US President Donald Trump appearing to doze off during the launch of his “Board of Peace” has gone viral on social media, sparking debate and criticism over his energy levels and fitness for office.The footage, recorded during the inaugural meeting at the United States Institute of Peace, shows the 79-year-old president sitting with his eyes closed and head slightly drooping while military officials and global representatives delivered speeches.The moment occurred during remarks by Major General Jasper Jeffers III, when Trump appeared motionless with his eyes shut for several seconds, prompting speculation online about whether he had briefly fallen asleep.The meeting itself was significant, bringing together representatives from more than 40 countries to discuss global peace initiatives, including reconstruction efforts in Gaza and international stabilisation forces.Social media users quickly seized on the clip, with many questioning Trump’s alertness during his own high-profile event.One user wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, “Trump humiliates himself, falling fully asleep during world leader speeches at his own ‘Board of Peace’ meeting. He must be bored of peace.”Another commented, “This is absolutely humiliating on the world stage. Trump does not have the stamina to remain president.”Others mocked the viral moment more bluntly. “Trump asleep, again. The swaying is a dead giveaway,” one user posted, while another wrote, “Bored of Peace? He’s too old to be president.”The video added to a series of recent instances where Trump appeared visibly fatigued during official meetings and public events.This is not the first time Trump has addressed such incidents. Responding to similar footage from a cabinet meeting last year, Trump denied falling asleep.“Some people said, he closed his eyes. Look, it got pretty boring,” Trump said. “I didn’t sleep. I just closed them because I wanted to get the hell outta here.” He also added, “I don’t sleep much.”The White House has previously said Trump remains in good health, noting that recent medical tests were preventative and showed strong cardiac condition. Officials also attributed visible bruising on his hands to aspirin use as a precaution against cardiovascular disease.At 79, Trump is currently the oldest serving US president, and his health has remained under public scrutiny.Despite the viral moment, Trump used the meeting to announce major global peace and reconstruction initiatives.He said the United States would contribute $10 billion to support the Board of Peace’s efforts, particularly focusing on rebuilding war-affected regions such as Gaza.Trump also announced that nine countries, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Kazakhstan, had pledged more than USD 7 billion toward relief and reconstruction.In addition, Indonesia, Morocco, Albania, Kosovo and Kazakhstan agreed to deploy troops or police forces to support stabilisation efforts, while Egypt and Jordan committed to training Palestinian security personnel.Trump also urged Iran to reach a diplomatic agreement on its nuclear programme, warning that failure to do so could have serious consequences.“We have to make a meaningful deal. Otherwise, bad things happen,” Trump said, stressing that nuclear weapons would undermine peace in the Middle East.He described the Board of Peace as a body that would work alongside and strengthen the United Nations, while promoting stronger global cooperation.While the Board of Peace meeting marked a major diplomatic initiative involving dozens of countries, the viral video has drawn significant attention away from its announcements.The White House has not directly commented on the specific clip, but officials continue to emphasise Trump’s active role in international diplomacy and ongoing peace negotiations.","Video of US President Donald Trump appearing to doze off has gone viral on social media.
