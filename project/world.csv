Putin: India could be mediator on Ukraine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/putin-india-could-be-mediator-on-ukraine/articleshow/113108442.cms,"Kremlin: 'No specific plans' on Modi mediating on Ukraine issue

Russian President Vladimir Putin Thursday said he was constantly in touch with India, China and Brazil over the Ukraine war, adding these countries were making efforts to resolve the conflict. An agency report from Vladivostok quoted him as saying these countries could potentially act as mediators.""If there is a desire of Ukraine to carry on with the negotiations, I can do that.We respect our friends and partners, who, I believe, sincerely seek to resolve all issues surrounding this conflict, primarily China, Brazil and India,"" Putin said at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok.Separately, Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the Izvestia daily that India could help in establishing a dialogue on Ukraine. Underlining the ""highly constructive, even friendly relations"" between Modi and Putin, he said the Indian PM could ""lead the line on getting first-hand information from the participants in this conflict"" as he ""freely communicates with Putin, with Zelensky, and with the Americans"".PM Modi had travelled to Moscow in July, where he told Putin that the conflict could not be resolved on the battlefield, and followed it up with a visit to Kyiv last month during which he reiterated India's willingness to contribute in all possible ways to facilitate an early return of peace.On his return, Modi spoke to Putin and conveyed to him India's readiness to actively support any political or diplomatic settlement.PM Modi's rapport with Putin, Zelensky and the US ""gives a great opportunity for India to throw its weight in world affairs, to use its influence that would drive the Americans and Ukrainians towards using a greater political will and entering the peaceful settlement track"", Kremlin spokesman Peskov said.However, India has continued to maintain that it won't initiate any peace process on its own and will mediate only if asked to. India has also insisted that enduring peace is possible only if both sides are involved in any initiative.For India to play any role though, it's important that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also agrees. He had suggested during Modi's visit that India could consider hosting the next peace summit but then effectively ruled India out as he asserted that only a country that endorsed the joint communique at the first summit could play host. India had not taken part in the first summit since Russia was not invited.Peskov also said there were ""no specific plans"" on Modi mediating on the issue. ""At this time they can hardly exist, as we do not see any preconditions for talks for now,"" the Kremlin spokesman said. Modi on Aug 23 visited Ukraine where he conveyed to Zelensky that both Ukraine and Russia should sit together without wasting time to end the war and that India was ready to play an ""active role"" to restore peace in the region.","Russian President Vladimir Putin said he was constantly in touch with India, China and Brazil over the Ukraine war.

'Flying Chernobyl': Can Russia's new nuclear-powered missile be a game-changer?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/burevestnik-ssc-x-9-skyfall-russias-new-nuclear-cruise-missile-vladimir-putin/articleshow/113058073.cms,"Driving the news

Recent satellite imagery suggests Russia is constructing launch facilities near a nuclear warhead storage site in Vologda, about 295 miles north of Moscow, where experts believe the missile could be deployed.

This development, first reported by Reuters, has raised concerns about Moscow’s ambitions to operationalize the missile despite a history of failed tests and safety issues.

The Burevestnik was first revealed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2018, who touted it as part of a new generation of “invincible” weapons that could evade US missile defenses and strike anywhere in the world.

in 2018, who touted it as part of a new generation of “invincible” weapons that could evade US missile defenses and strike anywhere in the world. Its unique propulsion system—powered by a miniature nuclear reactor—grants it an almost unlimited range, allowing it to fly low and avoid detection. But its lengthy and troubled testing record, along with the technical and safety challenges it presents, has left many experts skeptical of its actual military value.

Jeffery Lewis, a missile expert at the Middlebury Institute, reviewed the satellite images and concurred. ""This imagery suggests something very unique, very different. It aligns with Russia’s development of this nuclear-powered missile,"" he remarked, highlighting the unusual characteristics of the site and its close proximity to nuclear storage bunkers.

A satellite image shows what is believed to be a deployment site for a Russian nuclear-powered cruise missile.

Why it matters

The Burevestnik represents a bold leap in missile technology, but its potential deployment could intensify an already volatile global security environment.

The missile's ability to bypass current missile defense systems gives it a unique capability that worries Western analysts, though many argue that the practical benefits of such a weapon remain questionable.

If deployed, the Burevestnik could further escalate the nuclear arms race, especially as US-Russia arms control agreements like New START inch toward expiration.

At the same time, the missile’s unproven reliability and significant safety risks—particularly the possibility of radiation leaks from its nuclear reactor—pose a threat not only to potential adversaries but also to Russia itself.

The missile’s subsonic speed, one of its key design flaws, makes it vulnerable to interception, undermining its intended stealth advantages. Furthermore, the risk of catastrophic failure during testing or deployment could result in severe environmental consequences.

Zoom in

The Burevestnik is designed around a concept that has been explored since the early days of the nuclear age: a nuclear-powered propulsion system that would allow a missile to fly indefinitely. Unlike conventional missiles that rely on limited fuel reserves, the Burevestnik’s miniature nuclear reactor provides the energy needed to keep it in flight for days, potentially even allowing it to circumnavigate the globe.

The missile is launched using solid-fuel boosters, which propel it into the air, where its nuclear reactor activates to sustain its flight. In theory, the missile can fly at low altitudes to evade radar detection while maintaining a range of around 15,000 miles (23,000 kilometers). This would enable it to reach targets anywhere in the world, far surpassing the range of existing intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).

However, the missile’s subsonic speed—a byproduct of its nuclear propulsion—has raised concerns about its detectability. While it can fly longer than traditional missiles, it moves slower, giving enemy defense systems more time to track and potentially intercept it. This drawback limits the missile’s operational value compared to other Russian missile systems, such as the Sarmat ICBM, which is faster and capable of delivering multiple warheads over similar distances.

Between 2017 and 2019, Russia conducted at least 13 known tests of the Burevestnik, with most ending in failure. Only two tests were reported as partial successes. In one test in 2019, the missile crashed into the White Sea, causing a catastrophic explosion that killed several Russian scientists. This incident highlighted the dangers of the missile’s nuclear-powered engine, leading experts to question whether the risks outweigh the benefits.

The big picture

The potential deployment of the Burevestnik is being closely monitored by the US and Nato, especially after satellite imagery revealed construction activities near the Vologda-20 nuclear warhead storage facility. The site, located roughly 400 miles from Russia’s borders with Finland and Estonia, appears to be designed for large, fixed missile systems, according to analysts. This development suggests that Russia may be preparing to station Burevestnik missiles at the site, making them ready to launch on short notice.

Experts remain divided on whether the Burevestnik would significantly alter Russia’s strategic capabilities. Some argue that the missile’s ability to evade missile defenses and fly long distances gives it a unique advantage, particularly in a second-strike scenario. Others, however, are skeptical.

One of the most significant concerns surrounding the Burevestnik is its nuclear propulsion system. Because the missile is powered by an unshielded nuclear reactor, it could spew radioactive material along its flight path or in the event of a malfunction.

When compared to other missile systems in Russia’s arsenal, the Burevestnik’s advantages appear limited. For instance, the Sarmat ICBM, which also carries nuclear warheads, has a range of over 11,000 miles (17,700 kilometers) and can deliver multiple warheads at hypersonic speeds. This makes it far more difficult to intercept than the slower Burevestnik, which could be tracked and shot down during its prolonged flight.

Moreover, the Burevestnik’s unique propulsion system raises significant safety and reliability concerns. The 2019 explosion during a test recovery operation underscored the dangers of handling a nuclear-powered missile.

What they are saying

“The Skyfall is a uniquely stupid weapon system, a flying Chernobyl that poses more threat to Russia than to other countries,” said Thomas Countryman, a former US State Department official.

is a uniquely stupid weapon system, a flying Chernobyl that poses more threat to Russia than to other countries,” said Thomas Countryman, a former US State Department official. Hans Kristensen, from the Federation of American Scientists, told Reutets that the missile will be ""as vulnerable as any cruise missile,"" while analyst Jeffery Lewis emphasizes, ""The site’s design suggests they’re preparing for something very unique.""

“I don’t understand Putin’s motive here,” Kristensen added, referring to the missile’s uncertain strategic value.

As per Reuters, Decker Eveleth, the analyst who identified the construction site, believes it’s clearly designed for the Burevestnik. ""The site is for a large, fixed missile system, and the only large system they're currently developing is Skyfall,"" he said, pointing to the nine horizontal launch pads shielded by berms to protect against explosions or attacks.

What’s next

As Russia moves closer to deploying the Burevestnik, the missile’s impact on global security remains uncertain. While it could symbolize Russia’s determination to maintain its status as a nuclear superpower, its actual operational value may be limited by its technical flaws and safety issues.

The missile’s troubled test history suggests that it may not live up to the lofty claims made by Putin when he first announced it in 2018.

Nonetheless, the Burevestnik’s development could have broader implications for the global arms race. With the US and Russia’s New START treaty set to expire in 2026, the missile could become a bargaining chip in future arms control negotiations. Pavel Podvig, a Russian nuclear expert, described the missile as a “political weapon” that Putin has used to project strength and signal Russia’s willingness to challenge the West.

As tensions between Russia and the West continue to rise—particularly in the context of the war in Ukraine—the Burevestnik’s deployment could add another layer of complexity to an already dangerous geopolitical landscape.

However, ""the Burevestnik is not a wonder weapon, and the challenges it poses for NATO security are neither new nor unmanageable. It may seem scary on paper, but the technical infeasibility of its mission limits its threat. Much of the hype around the missile stems from Russian saber-rattling about its capabilities,"" Eveleth, an analyst with the CNA research, wrote in a report in Foreign Policy.

Survey details

Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are virtually tied in key battleground states , according to a YouGov poll conducted for The Times and SAY24. The survey, covering August 23 to September 3, highlighted a close race with Harris leading in four swing states while Trump edged ahead in three, all within the margin of error, reported The Hill.Harris held a slight edge in Michigan, Nevada, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania.The poll showed her leading by five points in Michigan (48% to 43%), three points in both Nevada (49% to 46%) and Wisconsin (47% to 44%). In Pennsylvania, she led by just one point (46% to 45%) among registered voters.Trump, on the other hand, led in Georgia, Arizona, and North Carolina. His leads were narrow, with a two-point advantage in both Arizona (47% to 45%) and Georgia (47% to 45%). In North Carolina, he was slightly ahead with 47% support compared to Harris’s 46%.Carl Bialik, Vice President of Data Science at YouGov, commented, “Even compared to March, Harris was running ahead or even in each state. She was performing on par with or better than Biden’s 2020 results in these battlegrounds.” He added, “If these leads held and the rest of the states voted similarly to 2020, Harris would have won the electoral college.”CNN’s recent polling showed no decisive lead in Georgia, Nevada, and Pennsylvania, with Harris ahead by 50% to 44% in Wisconsin and 48% to 43% in Michigan. Conversely, Trump has a five-point lead in Arizona (49% to 44%).According to The Hill/Decision Desk HQ, Harris led Trump by 4 percentage points (49.7% to 45.7%) in aggregate polls. A USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll from August 25-28 also showed Harris ahead by 48% to 43%, within the margin of error.Despite these fluctuations, betting markets—which are not legally regulated in the U.S.—reflected ongoing uncertainty, with Harris slightly ahead post-Democratic National Convention.The YouGov poll surveyed 900 respondents in Arizona and Wisconsin, 800 in Nevada, and 1,000 in the remaining states, with a margin of error between 3 and 5 percent.As the election landscape continued to shift, these battleground states remained pivotal, with both candidates fighting hard for every vote.","Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are virtually tied in key battleground states, according to a YouGov poll conducted for The Times and SAY24.

Just remember that. If they win, Israel is gone.” He urged Jewish voters to support him, claiming that failure to do so would lead to a “very terrible situation” for Israel.Trump, who has previously criticized Jewish Democrats and questioned their support for Israel, escalated his rhetoric during the speech. He suggested that Jewish voters who back Harris need to have their “head examined,” reflecting his ongoing criticisms of Jewish Democrats and their support for President Joe Biden.The former president also acknowledged the deaths of six Israeli hostages, mistakenly referring to one as “Hersh Goldman” before correcting himself. He reiterated his belief that the recent attacks on Israel would not have occurred under his presidency, vowing to ensure America remains a staunch ally of Israel.In response, the Harris campaign condemned Trump's comments as offensive and dangerous. Spokesperson Morgan Finkelstein accused Trump of openly demeaning Jewish Americans and aligning with extremist views. “Donald Trump openly demeans Jewish Americans, proudly dined with a neo-Nazi, and reportedly thinks Adolf Hitler ‘did some good things,’” Finkelstein said. “He has said the only people he wants counting his money are ‘short guys wearing yarmulkes,’ and praised neo-Nazis who chanted ‘Jews will not replace us’ as ‘very fine people.’”Harris, whose husband Doug Emhoff is Jewish, reaffirmed her commitment to Israel’s security and right to defend itself, contrasting her stance with Trump’s remarks.","Former President Donald Trump made alarming predictions about the future of Israel if Vice President Kamala Harris were to win the presidential election.

What happened after the raid?

Who are Sheena Wright and Philip Banks

Federal authorities on Wednesday raided the homes of at least four top officials in Mayor Eric Adams ' administration, including police commissioner Edward Caban , amid an investigation by the US Attorney's Office.The probe involves New York Police Department executives who have been asked to voluntarily surrender their electronic devices and it also includes first deputy mayor Sheena Wright and deputy mayor Philip Banks, according to a CBS News report citing sources.The NYPD confirmed they were aware of the investigation but did not specify which personnel were under scrutiny. The department expressed its commitment to cooperating with federal authorities. A spokesperson said, ""We follow the rules. We make sure that we cooperate and turn over any information that is needed.""FBI agents took part in the operations early Wednesday morning.Among the raided officials, Wright and Banks had their cellphones confiscated during the raids . Wright shares a home with Schools Chancellor David Banks, Philip Banks' brother.Mayor Adams discussed the matter with CBS News New York's Marcia Kramer on Thursday afternoon, showing a composed demeanor. He emphasized his directive to his staff to adhere to the law and assist with inquiries.""You know, Marcia, I say over and over again, as a former member of law enforcement, I'm very clear. We follow the rules. We make sure that we cooperate and turn over any information that is needed and it just really would be inappropriate to get in the way of the review while it's taking place,"" Adams stated. ""I am not aware of any misdoings and I'm going to, again, follow the rules and I will continue to tell the team to do that. And that's what they have been doing, to my knowledge.""""So why do they keep targeting you and members of your administration?"" ""I mean, it's like a constant, drip, drip, drip, "" Kramer questioned.""Those are questions I can't answer. I'm going to ... I know what I'm going to do, and this information is needed to show that I have always followed the law. We're going to give that information,"" Adams responded. The reason for the raids is not clear. No official reason for the raids has been given, though insiders suggest the investigation is not linked to prior inquiries into expensive flight upgrades to Turkey related to Adams' 2021 campaign.Adams' mayoral campaign faces ongoing corruption investigations, resulting in new subpoenas as recently as July. In 2023, the FBI targeted the home of Adams' then-fundraiser Brianna Suggs in a campaign financing probe.Police commissioner Caban canceled a public event on Thursday following the raids.Schools chancellor David Banks, however, remained focused on his duties, overseeing the first day of classes for New York City public schools.""Today is all about the kids of New York City, and that's what we're going to focus on,"" he remarked.First deputy mayor Sheena Wright has been with the Adams administration since 2022, initially overseeing strategic initiatives before becoming first deputy mayor in 2023.

Trump says US colleges could lose accreditation over 'antisemitic propaganda' if he's elected,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-says-us-colleges-could-lose-accreditation-over-antisemitic-propaganda-if-hes-elected/articleshow/113109396.cms,"Wish list for Trump

LAS VEGAS: Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump told Jewish donors on Thursday that US universities would lose accreditation and federal support over what he described as "" antisemitic propaganda "" if he is elected to the White House.""Colleges will and must end the antisemitic propaganda or they will lose their accreditation and federal support,"" Trump said, speaking remotely to a crowd of more than 1,000 Republican Jewish Coalition donors in Las Vegas.Protests roiled college campuses in spring, with students opposing Israel's military offensive in Gaza and demanding institutions stop doing business with companies backing Israel.Republicans have said the protests show some Democrats are antisemites who support chaos. Protest groups say authorities have unfairly labeled their criticism of Israel's policies as antisemitic.The Association of American Universities , which says it represents some 69 leading US universities, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.In the United States, the federal government does not directly accredit universities but has a role in overseeing the mostly private organizations that give colleges accreditation .In his speech, Trump also said he would ban refugee resettlement from ""terror infested"" areas like Gaza and arrest ""pro-Hamas thugs"" who engage in vandalism, an apparent reference to the college student protesters.Under both Trump and Biden, similar numbers of Palestinians were admitted to the US as refugees. From fiscal year 2017-2020, the US accepted 114 Palestinian refugees, according to US State Department data, compared with 124 Palestinian refugees from fiscal year 2021 to July 31 of this year.While Trump sketched out few concrete Middle Eastern policy proposals for a second term, he painted a potential Harris presidency in cataclysmic terms for Israel.""You're going to be abandoned if she becomes president. And I think you need to explain that to your people ... You're not going to have an Israel if she becomes president,"" Trump said without providing evidence for such a claim.A campaign spokesperson for Vice President Kamala Harris, Morgan Finkelstein, said Harris was a lifelong supporter of Israel and stood against antisemitism. Finkelstein highlighted that Trump in 2022 dined with white supremacist Nick Fuentes at his Mar-A-Lago resort and that in 2017 he said there were ""very fine people"" on both sides of a deadly rally by white nationalists in Virginia.Harris has hewed closely to President Joe Biden's strong support of Israel and rejected calls from some in the Democratic Party that Washington should rethink sending weapons to Israel because of the heavy Palestinian death toll in Gaza.She has, however, called for a ceasefire in Gaza, calling the situation there ""devastating.""Health authorities in Gaza say more than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli assault on the enclave since the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks led by Palestinian Islamist group Hamas .Some 1,200 Israelis were killed in the surprise attack and about 250 were taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies.The subsequent assault on Gaza has displaced nearly its entire 2.3 million population, caused a hunger crisis and led to genocide allegations at the World Court that Israel denies.The Republican Jewish Coalition Victory Fund says it is spending some $15 million to support Trump by helping bring out Jewish voters in battleground states.The network has been financially supported by Sheldon Adelson, the late American casino mogul, and his Israeli-born widow Miriam Adelson. RJC members gathered this week for their annual conference at The Venetian Resort, which was developed by Sheldon Adelson's company, the Las Vegas Sands Corp. Miriam Adelson is also the lead financier of a super PAC spending group that has said it is looking to raise over $100 million to support Trump.In a half-dozen Reuters interviews at the conference, attendees broadly voiced three priorities for a potential second Trump term: Expanding the Abraham Accords , pursuing a tougher line on Iran, and either reforming or defunding the United Nations.The Trump administration in 2020 helped broker the Abraham Accords, a series of normalization agreements between Israel and Arab nations.But US-backed plans to normalize ties between Saudi Arabia and Israel were put on ice last year as war escalated between Israel and Hamas.RJC chairman Norm Coleman, who is also a lobbyist for Saudi Arabia in Washington, told Reuters he was still hopeful the Abraham Accords could be expanded under Biden.""But if it's not done, I would hope that President Trump would do what he did before and play a role in bringing the region together,"" Coleman said.","Donald Trump says he would ban refugee resettlement from ""terror infested"" areas like Gaza.

How the shooting unfolded

Leaders condemn shooting incident

A school shooting claimed the lives of four people and left nine others injured at Apalachee high school in Winder, in the American state of Georgia , late on Wednesday night.The suspect, identified as 14-year-old student Colt Gray , has been apprehended and is currently in custody.According to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI), the victims included two students and two teachers, although their identities have not been disclosed at this time.The motive behind the attack remains unclear, and officials have not confirmed any specific targets. The GBI stated, ""An additional nine were taken to various hospitals with injuries. The suspect is in custody and alive. Reports that the suspect has been 'neutralized' are inaccurate.""This shooting is yet another tragic incident in the ongoing gun violence crisis in America, with nearly 400 mass shootings reported in the country so far this year.Students who witnessed the attack shared harrowing accounts of the events that unfolded. Lyela Sayarath, a classmate of the alleged attacker, told CNN that the suspect left their algebra class early in the lesson and returned with a gun, which another student noticed and refused to let him in. The attacker then reportedly went to the neighboring classroom and began shooting.Alexsandra Romero, a second-year student, described the panic and fear that ensued when someone barged into her class, warning students to take cover. ""I can just remember my hands were shaking,"" Romero told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ""I felt bad because everybody was crying, everybody was trying to find their siblings. I can still picture everything, like the blood, the shouting.""Julie Sandoval, another student, recounted hiding in a corner with classmates until police arrived, praying and trying to stay calm while attempting to text her friends and parents. Marques Coleman, a 14-year-old student, described seeing the attacker holding a ""big gun"" before the shooting started and the chaos that followed as his teacher tried to barricade the door with desks.Authorities first received reports of the shooting at the high school, which serves approximately 1,900 students, around 10:20 am local time. Local sheriff Jud Smith described the attack as ""pure evil."" ""Within minutes law enforcement was on scene, as well as two school resource officers assigned to the school who immediately encountered the subject,"" the sheriff said in a news conference.Law enforcement responded quickly, with two school resource officers already on campus immediately confronting the suspect. Sheriff Smith recounted that the suspect ""gave up, got on the ground,"" and was taken into custody without further incident.The suspect, Colt Gray, had been on the FBI's radar as early as May 2023, following anonymous tips about online threats to commit a school shooting. FBI agents interviewed Gray and his father at that time, though no further action was taken, as there was no probable cause for an arrest.According to the FBI, Gray's father acknowledged having hunting guns at home but said that his son did not have unsupervised access to them. Gray, who was 13 at the time of the FBI interview, denied making the online threats, and the agency alerted local schools to monitor him.Among the victims was 14-year-old Mason Schermerhorn, who had autism, according to local reports. The Georgia school shooting incident adds to the growing list of mass shootings in the United States, with nearly 400 such incidents reported this year alone.President Joe Biden expressed sorrow and frustration over the tragedy stating, “Jill and I are mourning the deaths of those whose lives were cut short due to more senseless gun violence and thinking of all of the survivors whose lives are forever changed,” Biden said in a statement. He called for bipartisan action, urging Republicans to work with Democrats on ""common-sense gun safety legislation.""Vice president Kamala Harris, who is also the Democratic nominee for president, described the incident as a “senseless tragedy.” During a campaign event in New Hampshire, she declared, “We’ve gotta stop it. We have to end this epidemic of gun violence.”Former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, took to social media to address the tragedy. “Our hearts are with the victims and loved ones of those affected by the tragic event in Winder, GA,” he wrote. “These cherished children were taken from us far too soon by a sick and deranged monster.”Georgia governor Brian Kemp said that the focus should be on the investigation rather than politics. ""Today is not the day for politics or policy. Today is the day for an investigation, to mourn these precious Georgians that we have lost,"" he said.","A school shooting claimed the lives of four people and left nine others injured at Apalachee high school in Winder, in the American state of Georgia.

Amid speculations that King Charles may step down owing to his ongoing battle with cancer making way for Prince William, Queen Camilla has shared a rare update about the King's health condition. The speculations have been rife after Prince William was learnt to have held meetings with the King to discuss the future of the throne. According to a report, the meeting indicates only one thing: the Prince of Wales is preparing to take over earlier than expected as his father battles cancer.A Royal insider said it would be the ""best decision"" for the King to step down now. “No one expects his [King Charles] reign to last much longer, especially because his health could take a dramatic turn for the worse at any time,” the insider was by In Touch. “Stepping down now would be the best decision for the monarchy,” the insider added.The speculations of a possible abdication have been doing the rounds for quite some time but gathered steam after William's recent meeting with the King.But amid all this, Queen Camilla has shared a rare update about the King's health during a visit to the state-of-the-are Dyson Cancer Center where she officially opened the building in Bath.

The King and Queen spent the summer at Balmoral and have plans to tour Australia soon.Previously in February, the 76-year-old King was diagnosed with cancer. After the Royal Family announced this, an old prophecy of Nostradamus was discussed much. A Nostradamus expert claimed that Nostradamus predicted that Prince Charles would be in his 70s when he becomes the King but there would be resentments against him. Many Nostradamus experts floated different interpretations -- some claimed Prince Harry would become the next King, some said Australia's Simon Dorante-Day who claimed to be the secret son of King Charles and Camilla will become the king.""King of Isles driven out by force...replaced by one who will have no mark of a king"" -- was what Nostradamus wrote in his 'Les Prophecies'.","Queen Camilla has shared a rare update about the King's health condition.

On Wednesday, that boy opened fire at his high school outside Atlanta, killing four people and wounding nine, officials said.The teen has been charged as an adult with using an assault-style rifle to kill two Apalachee High School students and two teachers in the hallway outside his algebra classroom, Georgia Bureau of Investigation director Chris Hosey said at a news conference.When the teen slipped out of class Wednesday, Lyela Sayarath figured her quiet fellow student who recently transferred was skipping school again. But he returned later and wanted back into the room. Some students went to open the locked door but instead backed away. The teen then turned the gun on people in a hallway. He has been charged in the deaths of students Mason Schermerhorn and Christian Angulo, both 14, and teachers Richard Aspinwall, 39, and Christina Irimie, 53, Hosey said. The teen, now 14, was to be taken to a youth detention facility.When the teen wasn't allowed back into his classroom, Sayarath said she heard a barrage of gunshots. ""It was about 10 or 15 of them at once, back-to-back,"" she said. The maths students fell to the floor and crawled around, looking for a safe corner to hide. Two school resource officers encountered the shooter within minutes of a report that shots had been fired, Hosey said. The teen immediately surrendered and was taken into custody.At least nine other people - eight students and one teacher at the school in Winder - were taken to hospitals with injuries. All were expected to survive. Authorities were still looking into how the teen got the gun used in the shooting.It was the 30th mass killing in the US so far this year, according to a database maintained by AP and USA Today in partnership with Northeastern University. At least 127 people have died in those killings.The teen had been interviewed after the FBI received anonymous tips in May 2023 about online threats to commit an unspecified school shooting, the agency said in a statement. The FBI had referred to the case to the sheriff's department in Jackson County. The sheriff's office interviewed the then-13-year-old and his father, who said there were hunting guns in the house but the teen did not have unsupervised access to them.

His remarks mark a sharp contrast to the current administration’s climate policies.Throughout his political career, Trump has repeatedly cast doubt on climate change, famously referring to it as a “hoax.” His administration, during his first term, was characterized by a rollback ofenvironmental regulations , favoring oil and gas drilling.Trump’s relationship with the fossil fuel industry is well-documented; in recent statements, he has even suggested that fossil fuel executives should raise $1 billion for his presidential campaign, promising in return to unleash further oil and gas drilling and cut environmental regulations.“If Donald Trump wins the upcoming US presidential elections,” analysts predict, “it could mean the swift dismantling of many of President Joe Biden’s clean energy rules,” as his campaign suggested last week.One of Trump’s most controversial moves during his first term was pulling the United States out of the Paris Agreement, a global pact aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and limiting global warming. Trump argued that the deal was unfair to the US, favoring countries like China and costing American jobs. In contrast, President Biden, upon taking office, quickly re-entered the US into the agreement.

Boulder King Soopers shooting: Prosecutor argues Colorado supermarket shooter who killed 10 was sane,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/boulder-king-soopers-shooting-prosecutor-argues-colorado-supermarket-shooter-who-killed-10-was-sane/articleshow/113109286.cms,"DENVER: A man who gunned down 10 people in a supermarket mass shooting was not insane when he unleashed terror in a Colorado college town but instead a calculated killer who understood what he did was wrong, a prosecutor said during opening arguments Thursday.Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity in the 2021 shooting of people in the parking lot and then inside a King Soopers grocery store in the college town of Boulder .No one, including Alissa's lawyers, disputes he was the shooter. The three-week trial is expected to focus on whether or not Alissa, who after the shooting was diagnosed with schizophrenia, was legally sane by being able to distinguish right from wrong.""The victims were random, but the murders were absolutely deliberate and intentional,"" Boulder County District Attorney Michael Dougherty told jurors in his opening statements.Alissa's motive, if he had one, has remained unclear and Dougherty did not posit one in opening statements. He argued that Alissa acted with intent and full knowledge of his wrongdoing - and had not been treated for mental illness before the shooting even though relatives told police he had been acting withdrawn and paranoid leading up to it.Most of those shot inside and outside the store were killed in just over a minute. Alissa targeted people who tried to flee - and made a special effort to finish off those he wounded with additional shots, Dougherty pointed out.""The shooter prepared to kill them, planned to kill them, and went and executed 10 people at King Soopers. That's why you're here,"" Dougherty told the jury after showing photos of each victim and describing why each one was at the store that day.No one survived the shooting with gunshot wounds. After shooting eight people, Alissa prowled the store - quiet except for background music still playing over the store speakers - then spotted and killed Suzanne Fountain, 59, as she left a hiding spot in another aisle.His final victim was Boulder Police officer Eric Talley, a father of seven and one of the first three police officers who entered the store.Alissa surrendered to other police who arrived, voluntarily stripping down to his underwear and complying with their instructions as they approached and handcuffed him.""There's no hallucinating, there's no delusion, there's no confusion,"" Dougherty said of Alissa's behavior.An attorney for Alissa was to make opening statements later Thursday.Alissa is charged with 10 counts of murder, 15 counts of attempted murder and other offenses in the shooting in Boulder, a college town about 30 miles (50 kilometers) northwest of Denver.If successful, Alissa's plea of not guilty by reason of insanity could enable him to avoid prison and instead be committed indefinitely to the state mental hospital.A mental health evaluator testified during a competency hearing in 2022 that Alissa said he bought firearms to carry out a mass shooting and suggested that he wanted police to kill him.The defense argued in a court filing that his relatives said he irrationally believed that the FBI was following him and that he would talk to himself as if he were talking to someone who was not there.However, prosecutors point out Alissa was never previously treated for mental illness and was able to work up to 60 hours a week in his family's restaurant business, something they say would not have been possible for someone severely mentally ill.Alissa's trial had been delayed because experts repeatedly found he was not able to understand legal proceedings and help his defense. But after Alissa improved after being forcibly medicated, Judge Ingrid Bakke ruled in October that he was mentally competent, allowing proceedings to resume.The perpetrator of a 2012 mass shooting at an Aurora, Colorado, movie theater also pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. Jurors in that case rejected the plea and sentenced defendant James Holmes to life in prison for the murders of 12 people.",Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity in the shooting of people in the parking lot and then inside a King Soopers grocery store in Boulder.

In the latest development, Georgia officials arrested Colin Gray , father of 14-year-old Colt Gray , who is accused of carrying out the deadly shooting at Apalachee High School . The shooting left four dead and nine injured.Investigators revealed Colt used an AR-15-style rifle in the attack, a firearm purchased by his father as a Christmas gift. As per the report by the Post, the rifle was given from father to son as a gift just seven months after authorities paid the pair a visit in May when the FBI received tips about online school shooting threats.The teen was interviewed after the sheriff received a tip from the FBI that Gray, then 13, “had possibly threatened to shoot up a middle school tomorrow.” The threat was made on Discord, a social media platform popular with video gamers, according to the sheriff's office incident report.Despite past investigations into threats made by Colt online, law enforcement had found no substantial evidence to act at the time.Sheriff Janis Mangum explained the earlier investigation: “The case was worked thoroughly last year, but at the time, the evidence wasn’t strong enough to confiscate their weapons.”Colin had assured authorities that his son had no unsupervised access to the family’s hunting guns, but that assurance has since proven tragically insufficient.The FBI's tip pointed to a Discord account associated with an email address linked to Colt Gray, the report said. But the boy said “he would never say such a thing, even in a joking manner,” according to the investigator's report.The interview transcript quotes the teen as saying: “I promise I would never say something where ...” with the rest of that denial listed as inaudible.“He knows the seriousness of weapons and what they can do, and how to use them and not use them,” the father, Colin Gray, said according to a transcript obtained from the sheriff's office.Authorities are now focusing on how Colt accessed the weapon and whether earlier warning signs could have prevented the attack.Authorities have now charged Colt as an adult with murder, accusing him of using a semiautomatic rifle to kill four and injure nine others. He had a history of struggling with his parent's separation and was often bullied, his father told investigators last year. Despite those issues, the teen frequently went hunting with his father, who described the ""greatest day ever"" when Colt shot his first deer.Colt and his father had been interviewed after the FBI tipped authorities about the teen possibly threatening to shoot up a school. The investigator's report noted inconsistencies, including the fact that the Discord account had been accessed in multiple locations, including Buffalo, New York, and featured profile details written in Russian. Despite the concerning behavior, no arrests were made due to a lack of evidence.Colin Gray, Colt’s father, admitted that guns were accessible in their home, but claimed they were unloaded. Colt had been photographed with blood smeared on his cheeks from hunting trips, further emphasizing the family's exposure to firearms.The shooting began when Colt left his Algebra class and tried to re-enter, but a student saw the gun and refused to let him in. He then turned to a nearby classroom and opened fire, firing 10 to 15 rounds.""I think he wanted to come to us first,"" His classmate, Lyela Sayarath, said, reported CNN.The first reports of an active shooter came in at around 10:20 am (local time) School resource officers and law enforcement quickly responded, and Colt was taken into custody after a brief confrontation.""I heard gunshots outside my classroom and people screaming, people begging not to get shot,"" said 14-year-old Macey Right. ""And then people sitting beside me (were) just shaking and crying.""The mass shooting at Apalachee High School marks the 30th such incident in the US this year.The shooting claimed the lives of two 14-year-old students, Christian Angulo and Mason Schermerhorn, as well as two beloved teachers, math teacher Christina Irimie and assistant football coach Richard Aspinwall.“We are truly heartbroken,” Christian’s older sister, Lisette Angulo, shared on a GoFundMe page to support the family.Apalachee Football also expressed their grief for Aspinwall: “To our beloved defensive coordinator Ricky Aspinwall, we will carry you heavy in our hearts.”Colt Gray, the 14-year-old accused of carrying out the deadly shooting at Apalachee High School, had denied ever threatening a school attack when interviewed by authorities in 2023. Jackson County Sheriff Janis Mangum defended the investigation from last year, saying, ""We did not drop the ball at all on this. We did all we could do with what we had at the time."" The interview followed an FBI tip about a threat made on Discord, but conflicting evidence prevented an arrest.The faculty’s quick actions, paired with newly implemented safety protocols like the Centegix alert system, likely prevented the tragedy from being even worse. “The protocols in this school and this system activated today prevented this from being a much larger tragedy than what we had,” said Georgia Bureau of Investigations Director Chris Hosey.The mass shooting at Apalachee High School marks the 30th such incident in the US this year.Colt had previously been investigated for threats made online in 2023, including an ominous reference to Sandy Hook shooter Adam Lanza. While both Colt and his father denied any intent to commit violence, the case was closed due to insufficient evidence.“The 13-year-old denied making the threats online,” Sheriff Mangum said in a Facebook post. However, the recent tragedy has reopened scrutiny into whether enough was done at the time.Colt Gray, currently in custody, is being held without bond and will be tried as an adult on charges of felony murder. His first court appearance is set for Friday, and investigators are piecing together how the gun was brought to school and if anyone else was involved in planning the attack.As the Apalachee High School community grapples with the shock of the incident, students like Macey express their fears about returning to school. “I really don’t want to go back. I feel like I shouldn’t have to go back to school worrying about dying.”","Colt Gray, 14, is accused of carrying out the deadly shooting at Apalachee High School.

Georgia school shooting: Who is Colin Gray? Father of shooter arrested in deadly Apalachee high attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/georgia-school-shooting-father-colin-gray-arrested-after-son-obtains-rifle-used-in-deadly-apalachee-high-attack/articleshow/113108596.cms,"Georgia state officials arrested Colin Gray , father of 14-year-old Colt Gray , the suspected shooter behind Wednesday’s tragic attack at Apalachee High School. The shooting left four people dead and nine others wounded, raising serious questions about how the teenager obtained the weapon used in the massacre.According to investigators, Colt Gray used an AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle to carry out the attack, killing two teachers and two students.Sources say the rifle was purchased by Colin Gray as a Christmas present for his son, just months after the family had been questioned about online threats related to a potential school shooting .The Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) confirmed Colin Gray’s arrest on Thursday. ""In coordination with District Attorney Brad Smith, the GBI has arrested Colin Gray, age 54, in connection to the shooting at Apalachee High School. Colin is Colt Gray's father,"" the GBI posted on X, formerly known as Twitter.Last year, both father and son were questioned by local authorities after threats appeared on a Discord account tied to potential violence at a school. However, no concrete evidence linked them to the threats. The father had claimed that while he kept hunting guns in the house, his son did not have unsupervised access. ""This case was worked, and at the time the boy was 13, and it wasn't enough to substantiate,"" explained Jackson County Sheriff Janis Mangum. ""If we get a judge's order or we charge somebody, we take firearms for safekeeping.""Despite these assurances, investigators now believe that the rifle used in Wednesday's shooting was purchased after the initial probe. “He knows the seriousness of weapons and what they can do, and how to use them and not use them,” the father, Colin Gray, said according to a transcript obtained from the sheriff's office.The timeline, provided by Colin Gray, places the gun purchase months after authorities investigated the family. The ease with which Colt Gray was able to access the weapon remains a key point of focus in the ongoing investigation.“This case was worked thoroughly last year, but at the time, the evidence wasn’t strong enough to confiscate their weapons,” Mangum added. “If we had solid proof, we would have taken the guns for safekeeping.”Jackson County investigators had closed the 2023 case after they were unable to link the Grays to the online threats or justify seizing their firearms. Now, with devastating consequences, the case has resurfaced with new urgency.Colt Gray was arrested shortly after the shooting and is being held without bond at the Gainesville Regional Youth Detention Center. The GBI has announced that he will be tried as an adult, with his arraignment scheduled for Friday morning via video in Barrow County Superior Court.The tragic shooting marks the first US school mass shooting of the new academic year, and investigators are working to determine whether warning signs were missed and if more could have been done to prevent Colt Gray from obtaining the weapon that led to this senseless tragedy.","Colin Gray, 54, has been arrested in connection to the shooting at Apalachee High School in Georgia.

His arrest, however, has been seen by the opposition as a ploy to implicate Imran in cases linked to May 9 riots. This apprehension had prompted Khan to approach the Islamabad high court on Tuesday, pleading to stop civilian authorities from handing him over to the military. “A few weeks ago, a retired senior army officer (Faiz Hameed) was taken into military custody. It has been widely speculated and reported in the media that he will be made an approver against the petitioner (Imran Khan) in cases pertaining to May 9 and 10, 2023 and the petitioner will be transferred to military custody on this basis,” the petition read.Govt officials have repeatedly said Hameed worked with Khan to plan the riots.Addressing a press conference in Rawalpindi, army’s spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said the law takes its own course if a person from the Pakistani army works for personal gain or promotes a specific agenda.“The case of Gen Hameed is a clear example that the army takes violations of its rules very seriously. He (Hameed) had overstepped his legal and constitutional boundaries at the behest of certain political elements,” Chaudhary said.He said Gen Hameed’s case was referred to the Pakistani army through the defence ministry in light of a “full belief in the army’s accountability process”, following which the army ordered a “high-level court of inquiry” into the matter.“There is a clear consensus within the army that it is a national, state-owned institution, which must be prevented from being used against the completion of goals related to specific political agendas.”Khan is being currently tried in a civil court for allegedly abetting the violence on May 9, 2023, a charge he has denied.",Court martial proceedings against former ISI chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (retd) were initiated. Allegations are linked to cases filed after Imran's supporters went on a rampage last year following his arrest.

It mentioned that no documentation or order has been attached to the petition. The registrar's office asked how the petitions can be filed in the Islamabad high court when cases have been filed in Punjab.Furthermore, the IHC registrar's office questioned how the petition can be filed in a high court while the matter of military trials is subjudice in the supreme court , according to a Geo News report.Speaking to reporters, Imran Khan's lawyer, Intezar Panjutha said that they talked to the PTI founder regarding his plea in the IHC. ""Nothing is more crucial that an ex-prime minister is being dragged to a military court. How can the leader of a popular political party be taken to a military court,"" Panjutha quoted the the PTI founder as saying.Panjutha further stated that a civilian cannot be tried in a military court in the light of a Supreme Court verdict. Last week, Pakistan's Federal minister for law and justice Senator Azam Nazeer Tarar, said that if needed, the Punjab government would take a decision on referring the PTI founder's case to a military court.In an informal talk with reporters on August 29, Tarar said, ""The prosecution of May 9 cases is being done by the Punjab government and the provincial government will decide to refer the case to a military court,"" Geo News reported, citing The News International.Earlier in August, Pakistan Defence Minister Khawaja Asif hinted at the possibility of Imran Khan's trial in military court for the May 9 riots. Asif made the remarks in response to former Pakistan PM Imran Khan's demand for an ""open trial"" of former inter-services intelligence chief (retd) Faiz Hamid.Violent protests erupted in Pakistan after Imran Khan was arrested from the premises of Islamabad High Court in a graft case on May 9, 2023. During the protests, the alleged PTI supporters vandalised military installations, including General Headquarters in Rawalpindi, and were involved in arson at the Lahore Corps commander house.In December 2021, the supreme court in a 5:1 majority verdict suspended its October 23, 2023 order wherein it declared civilians' trials in military courts null and void in connection with the May 9 riots, Geo News reported.The court's verdict came after intra-court appeals were filed by the federal and provincial governments and the defence ministry against the top court's decision announced by Justice Ijazul Ahsan-led bench earlier that year.According to the order issued on December 13, the military court trials would be conditioned on the Supreme Court's final verdict on the intra-court pleas.","The Islamabad high court registrar's office has raised objections on a petition filed by former Pakistan PM Imran Khan.

Lal Masjid: Former Lal Masjid cleric's spouse charged with terrorism in Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/former-lal-masjid-clerics-spouse-charged-with-terrorism-in-pakistan/articleshow/113021134.cms,"ISLAMABAD : The spouse of a former Lal Masjid cleric, along with 40 female students and others, has been charged with multiple offences, including terrorism , the Pakistan-based daily, Dawn reported on Tuesday.According to the Dawn report, the charges were filed at the Lohi Bher police station under Section 11-X of the Anti-Terrorism Act and various sections of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).According to Dawn, the police said that a group from Jamia Hafsa , led by Umme Hassan, the wife of cleric Maulana Abdul Aziz, arrived in Bahria Town Phase 4 armed and blocked a major road. They were protesting against alleged immoral activities in the area, which they claimed were being facilitated by local police and officials. The protesters also forcibly shut down businesses and threatened traders with severe consequences.When police intervened and invoked Section 144 of the CrPC, which bans gatherings, the demonstrators responded with hostility, Dawn state in its report. They attacked police officers with batons and sticks, damaged official vehicles, and used weapons to enforce the closure of business centers.Jamia Hafsa is a conservative madrassa adjacent to the controversial Lal Masjid mosque in Islamabad.The Lal Masjid controversy in Pakistan is a complex and contentious episode that unfolded primarily in 2007, involving a prominent mosque in Islamabad known for its association with Islamist radicalism. The mosque had increasingly become a centre of militant activity and anti-government sentiment, Dawn stated.Per Dawn's report, in response to the mosque's growing defiance and the enforcement of its version of Sharia law in the surrounding areas, the Pakistani government, under President Pervez Musharraf , launched Operation Silence . This military operation aimed to reclaim control from the militants who had fortified themselves within the mosque.The operation, marked by intense fighting and heavy casualties, drew significant criticism from Islamic groups, who condemned the military's tactics and the resultant civilian suffering.

"August deadliest month in Balochistan in six years, reports say",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/august-deadliest-month-in-balochistan-in-six-years-reports-say/articleshow/113018427.cms,"QUETTA: The Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS), a think tank based in Islamabad, reported that August has been the most violent month in Balochistan in the past six years.According to PICSS, there has been a 'dangerous increase' in anti-government violence in Pakistan during August, making it the most turbulent month in this period, with Balochistan recording the highest number of deaths.PICSS released a report on Monday indicating that at least 254 people were killed across Pakistan in August, including 92 civilians, 108 militants, and 54 armed soldiers. Furthermore, 150 people were injured in various incidents, with 88 of them being civilians.The majority of fatalities in Pakistan were attributed to 83 militant attacks , which resulted in the deaths of 175 individuals, including 92 civilians, 47 security personnel, and 36 militants. Additionally, 123 people were injured, with 88 civilians and 35 security personnel among them. August has been noted as the deadliest month since July 2018.Reports from other Baloch human rights organizations highlighted that Quetta, Kech, Awaran, and Khuzdar experienced the highest numbers of enforced disappearances , with these districts reporting 10, eight, seven, and six incidents, respectively.The situation in Balochistan is marked by significant challenges and unrest. The region has faced a surge in violence, with frequent militant attacks and ongoing extrajudicial killings. The security situation remains volatile, contributing to a heightened level of instability and human rights abuses. Despite international and local efforts to address these issues, Balochistan continues to grapple with severe human rights violations and a deteriorating security environment.The human rights situation is dire, characterized by ongoing conflict between separatist groups and the government, which has led to violence and military operations. Enforced disappearances are a serious issue, with many individuals being taken by security forces and held without charge. Freedom of expression is severely restricted, with journalists and activists facing threats and suppression, the report stated.Despite being resource-rich, the province remains economically marginalized, contributing to local grievances. Additionally, the conflict has caused significant internal and cross-border displacement. The lack of effective legal recourse and accountability for human rights abuses further exacerbates the problem, making the situation complex and deeply troubling.","August has been the most violent month in Balochistan in the past six years.

Anti-terror op turns sinister: Pakistani netizens being 'walled off' as army raises spectre of 'digital terrorism',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/anti-terror-op-turns-sinister-pakistani-netizens-being-walled-off-as-army-raises-spectre-of-digital-terrorism/articleshow/112898501.cms,"Munir's repeated attacks on social media

Imran's ouster & rise of digital activism

National internet firewall

NEW DELHI: Pakistan 's ""whole-of-system approach"" to countering militancy is evolving and may be taking a turn to the sinister as its army's new anti-terror operation ' Azm-e-Istehkam ' (Resolve for Stability) is increasingly focusing on what it calls "" digital terrorism "".Pakistan's Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir has over the past few months repeatedly warned that digital platforms are being exploited to disseminate misinformation and incite unrest against state institutions.He described the activities of ""inimical"" forces as a form of ""digital terrorism"" aimed at creating discord between the military and the public by spreading ""lies and fake news"".Launched in June, Azm-e-Istehkam is tackling not only traditional militancy, particularly in light of increasing attacks attributed to groups like the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), but the evolving nature of threats in the digital landscape.The shift has sparked widespread concern with some analysts suggesting that the military is carrying out ""prejudiced online surveillance"" and curbing internet speeds across the country to battle the new ""digital threat"".The characterisation of digital terrorism in Munir's speeches have been notably vague, with rights activists noting that the term lacks a clear legal definition and could be weaponised against individuals who express criticism of the military or government policies online.In recent months, Munir has repeatedly voiced ""concerns"" regarding the impact of social media on national security and public discourse.In May -- just months before launching Azm-e-Istehkam -- Munir highlighted the issue of ""negative propaganda"" on social media, asserting that it poses threats to the integrity and security of Pakistan. He emphasised the military's readiness to counter any conspiracies and condemned the spread of disinformation, urging adherence to constitutional limits on freedom of expression, particularly as outlined in Article 19 of the Constitution of Pakistan, which restricts incitement to violence and undermining national security.In August, Munir reiterated these concerns, stating that social media is being exploited to propagate ""anarchy"" and warned against campaigns targeting the military. His remarks came in the context of rising tensions and comparisons being drawn to political instability in neighboring countries.On August 14, he again criticised the misuse of social media for spreading chaos and false information, attributing ""digital terrorism"" to foreign elements. He stressed the state's responsibility to protect citizens from the adverse effects of social media-driven hysteria and urged the public to remain vigilant against misinformation.He also warned that social media was being exploited to propagate ""anarchy"". His remarks that ""anarchy is spread through social media"" followed a condemnation by the army of social media campaigns to target the Pakistan Armed Forces.""Just as terrorists use weapons to get their demands met, digital terrorists use negative propaganda and fake news on social media platforms, mobiles and computers to create despondency to get their demands met,"" Pakistani military spokesperson Lt. Gen. Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry had said.Chaudhry said the military had become the sole target of digital terrorists, and blamed a ""certain"" political party without naming ousted PM Imran Khan ’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf party, which has a formidable social media presence.Imran Khan has repeatedly accused the military for orchestrating his removal from power in April 2022, and specifically named Munir as being responsible for his subsequent arrest in May 2023, claiming the Army chief harboured a ""personal grudge"" against him.Khan also alleged that Munir was behind the crackdown on his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), stating: ""It is personal. It's got nothing to do with national interest"". He also accused Munir of ""dismantling the future of this country [Pakistan] to protect himself"".Khan's arrest led to riots in May where protesters for the first time in the nation's history vented their anger on the military attacking several army installations.Digital activism in Pakistan spiked following Imran's ouster, whose party has relied heavily on social media to coordinate its activities. After TV channels were banned from covering PTI events, Khan gave several speeches online challenging the military's role in politics.These online events were often marred by internet blackouts or slowdown. Though authorities have said the drop in internet speed was due to technical issues, activists have claimed that the army is strategically using a national firewall and manipulating the country's internet infrastructure to curb any dissenting voices on the web.Pakistan has experienced a notable slowdown in internet speeds over the past few months, with reports indicating that up to 40% slower speeds have affected nearly half of the country's 241 million internet users.Users have reported difficulties in sending and receiving messages on platforms like WhatsApp and accessing social media sites, which are crucial for communication and information dissemination, especially among the youth and political activists.Information Technology minister Shiza Fatima Khawaja has confirmed that it was upgrading its ""web management system"" to cope with cybersecurity threats but did not link the development to slower internet speeds.TOI has reported that the Pakistan government tested its firewall on two occasions, once in July and a second time in mid-August. Pakistan has allocated more than $70 million for a Digital Infrastructure Development Initiative in the latest budget.The timing of these frequent slowdowns also coincides with the launch of operation Azm-e-Istehkam, raising questions about whether the internet disruptions are also linked to efforts to control information amid rising political tensions and protests against the military's actions.Technology experts have suggested that the newly implemented internet firewall could provide the government with enhanced capabilities to censor online content, drawing comparisons to China's stringent internet regulations.Countries like China, Iran, Turkiye, and Russia have employed national firewalls for years to regulate internet content, saying they aim to pinpoint and restrict sources of propaganda content.","Pakistan's Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir has repeatedly warned that digital platforms are being exploited to disseminate misinformation and incite unrest against state institutions.

Attacks in Balochistan bid to derail SCO summit in October: Pakistan govt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/attacks-in-balochistan-bid-to-derail-sco-summit-in-october-pakistan-govt/articleshow/112974277.cms,"ISLAMABAD: A surge in daring militant attacks across Pakistan’s volatile provinces of Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has raised questions about the country’s internal security situation . Pakistan interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said the attacks were aimed at derailing the SCO heads of govt meeting in Islamabad on Oct 15-16.Amid heightened political polarisation in Pakistan, both Baloch separatists and Islamic militants, known as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), have intensified their attacks on security personnel and their facilities in the country’s southwest and northwest.The Baloch separatists also target people of Punjabi ethnicity in the province.On Aug 26, more than 70 people were killed in targeted killings and suicide bombings in different districts of Balochistan, while in Kulachi tehsil of Dera Ismail Khan in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.In a separate incident, a senior army officer, Lt Col Khalid Ameer, and three of his relatives, were kidnapped by TTP fighters when they were meeting people on their father’s death in Dera Ismail Khan. The army’s media wing, however, said on Sunday they have been released due to the role played by tribal elders.When the separatist militant outfit, the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), bombed a railway bridge linking Balochistan to the rest of Pakistan, attacked police and military posts, and targeted buses and trucks on a major highway, Pakistan’s Army chief General Asim Munir was meeting General Li Qiaoming, Commander of the People’s Liberation Army, in the garrison city of Rawalpindi. The bombings and shootings on August 25-26 were the deadliest in years in Balochistan, which borders Afghanistan and Iran.Former Balochistan chief minister, Abdul Malik Baloch, said disappointment is pushing people into insurgency. “Many Baloch are losing faith in Islamabad because of what they perceive to be its political intervention in the province. Political activists tell me that democracy here is a fraud. They feel we are wasting their time,” Baloch said.BLA’s coordinated attacks in Balochistan on Aug 25–26 demonstrated their growing strength. It is believed that US military hardware and weaponry have found their way into the hands of Pakistani militant organisations. Military equipment and weapons, worth billions of dollars, were left behind by the US and international forces following their withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. BLA’s acquisition of modern weapons, security experts believe, has enhanced its combat capabilities.Majority of BLA’s sophisticated strikes are thought to have been executed by the group’s suicide squad, known as Majeed Brigade.Islamabad blames Kabul for patronising Baloch separatists and the TTP. Qari Fasihuddin Fitrat, the military chief of Afghan Taliban , denied the accusation saying the militants plan and execute attacks from within Pakistan.","Pakistan interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said the attacks were aimed at derailing the SCO heads of govt meeting in Islamabad on Oct 15-16.

As Pakistan grapples with a surge in terrorist strikes in the past couple of years, its restive Balochistan province was rocked this week by a wave of attacks that have left more than 70 dead. The coordinated strikes, perhaps more widespread than any such assault in the past, by the separatist Baloch Liberation Army ( BLA ), have again foregrounded Baloch insurgency fuelled by decades of neglect and exploitation of impoverished Balochistan's natural resources as the soft underbelly of Pakistan.The attacks, which saw BLA targeting police stations and taking control of major highways, coincided with the death anniversary of Baloch leader Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti, who was killed 18 years ago in one of then president Pervez Musharraf's counter-insurgency operations.","Baloch insurgency fuelled by decades of neglect and exploitation of impoverished Balochistan's natural resources.
