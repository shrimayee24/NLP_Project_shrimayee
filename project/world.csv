The shooting took place during a Dussehra rally in Bandra at a time when the streets were being heavily patrolled, raising concerns about law and order in Mumbai.The attack took place outside his son Zeeshan's office in Nirmal Nagar, Bandra, around 9:30 p.m.Siddique was accompanied by only one of his two assigned police guards at the time, the other having left earlier in the evening. Witnesses reported that the attackers shot him from barely three feet away, while his police guard did nothing to intervene. It was later revealed that the guard had been incapacitated by pepper spray, allowing the gunmen to escape.Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime) Datta Nalawade said there had been no special security arrangements made for the three-time MLA. Nalawade also confirmed that Siddique had not filed any complaints about threats. Siddique had been provided with standard police protection-two officers during the day and one at night.According to witnesses, the police guard failed to react as the three assailants approached Siddique and opened fire from a close range-just three feet away. ""The accused had sprayed pepper spray on the police guard after the firing, which is why he couldn't react,"" an investigating officer said. ""Local police, along with members of the public, managed to apprehend two of the attackers after they attempted to hide in a nearby building."" said an officer. He added that a protection branch is also conducting an inquiry to find out if there was any lacuna on the guard's part.The killing has drawn comparisons to high-profile gangland murders of the 1990s, including the killings of BJP leader Prem Kumar Sharma and former Muslim League MLA Ziauddin Bukhari. The brazenness of the attack, combined with its timing during a public event like Dussehra, has raised security concerns.","Shooting took place during a Dussehra rally in Bandra at a time when streets were being heavily patrolled.

As they fled the spot, having neutralised the police guard in charge of Siddique's security with pepper spray, they ran past the crowd of devotees and entered the Children's Park 25-30 metres away.The sight of Siddique lying wounded on the ground next to his vehicle and the shouts from the crowd drew attention to the assailants as they ran into the park. A police team from Nirmal Nagar which was on bandobast duty nearby were directed to the spot within minutes. The team comprising assistant inspector Rajendra Dabhade, sub-inspectors Shailesh Chaudhary. Sudarshan Bankar, Vishal Palande, constables Sabdeep Awhad, Kiran Shelar, Sangram Athigre, and ATC staff Bhavesh N and Pratik Jadhav, surrounded the park.The team said they had responded to wireless messages from their senior from the police station.

We pursued the two armed suspects to the deserted Children Park near the Directorate of Vocational Education and Training Regional Office,"" said an officer.The guard at the Children's Park, Anwar Khan, said he was preparing food when he heard cops knocking at the gate. ""I accompanied them to all the corners of the park as it was pitch dark at night and there are lots of trees.""After a thorough search lasting 25 minutes, one team apprehended Dharmaraj Kashyap as he tried to scale the barbed wire boundary wall to escape via the Western Express Highway. Another team cornered Gurnail Singh, who surrendered after discarding his weapon. ""We seized two Glock automatic pistols and four magazines containing at least 28 bullets from the suspects,"" said the police.A police source from Nirmal Nagar said, ""Siddique had three cops as security for some time-two on day duty and one at night.

HYDERABAD: Barely seven months after he was cleared of having links with Maoists by Bombay HC, which called the trial court proceedings a “failure of justice”, former DU professor GN Saibaba died Saturday night at Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences hospital. Doctors said he was admitted for removal of gallstones and died of post-surgery complications.The 57-year-old wheelchair-bound teacher and activist spent over seven years in jail after he was first arrested in May 2014.He was acquitted in March by the HC. “When I went to prison, I had no ailm ent other than my disability. Now, my heart is 55% functional... liver, gallbladder and pancreas have also been affected,” he’d said on his release.Acquitting him, the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court had called the trial court proceedings a “failure of justice”, and pointed out the lack of sanction under UAPA to prosecute him. It also said the prosecution had failed to establish the seizure of incriminating material from his house.“When I went to prison, I had no ailments other than my disability. Now, my heart i s only 55% functional, and I am facing muscular complications. My liver, gallbladder and pancreas have also been affected. My right hand is partially functional. My doctor says I need multiple surgeries,” he had told reporters after his release on March 6.“I couldn’t go to the prison hospital. There was not a single access ramp for the disabled in the jail, no separate toilets. I was always physically lifted for my toilet and bath needs. How can one live like that?” he had said. Saibaba was kept in the ‘anda cell’ (solitary confinement) atNagpur central jail , which, he said, affected him mentally as well.Probe agencies came across Saibaba’s name allegedly after the arrest of a JNU student who claimed to have been acting as a courier between the professor and Maoists holed up in Abujhmarh forests in Chhattisgarh. Saibaba was arrested by Maharashtra police for allegedly conspiring to wage war against the nation besides violations under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). A Gadchiroli court convicted him of the charges and awarded him life imprisonment in 2017. After a prolonged legal battle, he was acquitted by the high court.“Saibaba played a key role in several people’s movements like pro-reservation protests in 1989-90, democratic rights of prisoners in 1993, movement to support the rights of Adivasis, and several others. Though he hailed from Andhra Pradesh, he led a huge public meeting in support for the formation of separate Telangana in 1997,” said K Ravi Chander, convener for Forum Against Repression, who knew Saibaba for 35 years.Saibaba was born in Anakapalli in AP. After graduating, he p ursued his postgraduation in University of Hyderabad. He was working as an English professor in Delhi University until he was arrested. After he was released from jail, he underwent medical treatment in Delhi for various health complications — a fallout of his prolonged stay in jail. He is survived by his wife and daughter.His friends and colleaguesremembered Saibaba, whom they fondly called Sai, as a fighter. “He got polio when he was five years old. That is when his struggle began and never ended,” said Nandita Narain, former St Stephen’s College professor. “I learnt about him when I was elected member of DU’s Executive Council from 1996 to 2000. He once came to my house with his wife when he didn’t have a wheelchair. He was just dragging himself, but had a big smile on his face.”Narain added, “Those 10 years in jail left him completely broken. He was thrown around and dragged when he got arrested. He had 21 ailments when we last counted. They did this to him because he spoke up on issues that nobody spoke about. They wanted to crush his voice. He still had the determination. In the prison, he used to teach inmates.” She also remembered, “When he came out of prison, he made pickles with lemons from Medak himself and gave them to me. He said it would be good for my health.”Saibaba had a strong presence and he drove things, recalled Karen Gabriel, viceprincipal of St Stephen’s. “We had common issues that we were fighting like land grabbing, illegal mining, etc., and we became good friends”.Gabriel said Saibaba hadn’t ever been fragile. “Then we saw how fragile they made him in prison. He was barely able to lift his right arm when left jail. His organs were damaged,” she said. “I spoke to his family and they are in a shambles.”(With inputs from Meghna Dhulia)",Former DU professor GN Saibaba died Saturday night at Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences.

How many Kashmiri Pandits were forced to leave?



National Conference (NC) chief Farooq Abdullah on Saturday appealed to the Kashmiri Pandits to ""come back home"". The Kashmiri Hindu community faced a mass exodus in the early 1990s when armed insurgency and terrorism peaked in the Valley, forcing them to flee Kashmir In an assurance to the Kashmiri Pandits, Abdullah, who is also J&K's former CM, said they ""should feel that the National Conference government is not their enemy"".""I hope that our brothers and sisters who have left from here come back home. Now the time has come, they should return to their homes. We do not think only about Kashmiri Pandits, but we also think about the people of Jammu, we should treat them well, they should also feel that the National Conference government is not their enemy. We are Indians and we want to take everyone along,"" Farooq Abdullah said.Abdullah's NC party, in alliance with the Congress party, swept the recently concluded J&K assembly polls, bagging 42 seats in the 90-member House while the Congress won six seats.In the polls, more than 35,000 displaced Kashmiri Pandits from across the country were eligible to vote at 24 polling stations in the first phase of the three-phased Assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir In the second phase, nearly 40 per cent of eligible Kashmiri Pandits cast their ballots across the polling stations in Jammu, Delhi and Udhampur.The Kashmiri Pandits registered a voter turnout of over 30 per cent in the third and final phase of the elections in Jammu and Kashmir. Spread across 16 assembly segments in three districts of North Kashmir, out of 18,357 registered displaced Pandit voters, 5,545 turned up to cast their votes at 24 specially designated polling booths in Jammu, Udhampur and Delhi-NCR.The migration numbers have changed a lot over time, even in official records, presumably because they are constantly updated.In the years right after Kashmiri Pandits started leaving, the government put out an estimate of 50,000 families who had left Kashmir because of militancy.The 2022 estimate is actually lower — at 44,684. The number of migrant people, according to the Union ministry of home affairs in 2022, is a little over 1.5 lakh.","National Conference (NC) chief Farooq Abdullah appealed to the Kashmiri Pandits to ""come back home"" The Kashmiri Hindu community faced a mass exodus in the early 1990s when armed insurgency and terrorism peaked in the Valley.

NEW DELHI: Union minister Pralhad Joshi on Saturday responded to Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge 's ""terrorist party"" remarks about the Bhartiya Janata Party BJP ).Joshi highlighted past terror incidents during the United Progressive Alliance ( UPA ) rule, accusing Congress of being lenient on terror convicts.Joshi attacked the grand old party for ""being soft"" towards Afzal Guru and said Sonia Gandhi expressed sympathy for terrorists killed in the Batla House encounter.He also pointed out that it is under Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's leadership that there has been a major decline in terrorist activities.Joshi shared his views on social media, saying, ""Mallikarjun Kharge mistakenly called BJP as Terrorist party by slip of tongue, however it was Sonia Gandhi who shed tears for terrorists who died in Batla House. It was Congress which was soft on Afzal Guru. It was Congress who repealed POTA in 2004. It was their PM Manmohan Singh who shook hands with Separatist Militants.""He added, ""It's only under PM Narendra Modi ji that we have seen a significant decline in terrorist activities. Today Kashmiri youth have jobs instead of stones, which was the situation during Congress rule. As a senior leader, Kharge should double-check what he says.""This exchange came after Mallikarjun Kharge's criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. On October 12, Kharge rejected PM Modi’s claim that Congress is controlled by ""Urban Naxals"" and accused the BJP of being associated with acts of violence against Scheduled Castes and tribals.Kharge said, ""Progressive people are being called Urban Naxals...this is his (PM Modi's) habit. His party (BJP) itself is a terrorist party. They engage in lynching, assault people, urinate in the mouths of Scheduled Castes members, and rape tribal people. They also support those who commit these acts, and then they blame others.""Kharge further added, ""Wherever his government is in power, atrocities are committed against people from Scheduled Castes, especially tribals. Then he talks about these atrocities...It is his government, he can control it.""Following these remarks, BJP National Spokesperson CR Kesavan criticised Kharge, accusing the Congress of having a divisive and communal mindset.Kesavan commented, ""Kharge's remarks further expose the Congress party's prejudiced, and toxic communal mindset and ideology of divide and rule, similar to that of the colonial British. The nation should not forget when the Congress talks about terrorism, how it equated terrorism with the Hindu community.""","Pralhad Joshi responded to Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge's ""terrorist party"" remarks about the Bhartiya Janata Party BJP.

TIRUPATI: More than 70 persons were injured at the traditional Banni festival stick-fight between two groups at Devaragattu village in Holagunda mandal in Kurnool district late on Saturday night and in the early hours on Sunday.The injured were rushed to the mobile hospital set up at Devaragattu and to the Aluru and Adoni government hospitals in Kurnool district by the district police wing.The Banni festival is celebrated on the night of Vijaya Dasami festival every year to celebrate the victory of Lord Mala Malleswara Swamy and Goddess Parvati Devi over demons Mani and Mallasura who used to trouble noble men and saints at the Devaragattu region.Keeping the ancient traditions alive, Kalyanotsavam fete was held past midnight on Saturday and the idols were taken out in a procession atop the Aswa Vahanam by thousands of devotees hailing from Neraniki, Neraniki Thanda and Kothapeta villages.Meanwhile, the rival group of devotees from Aluru, Sullivan, Yellarthi, Arizona and Netravatti villages joined hands together to hijack the prpcessional deities in a bid to divert the procession to their own villages, which according to them is considered auspicious for the whole village.As the procession surged forward from Rakshapadi, the two groups of villagers armed with flaming torches, long sticks, metal ringed clubs etc, clashed with one another in a fierce battle, in a bid to take control of the procession.Later, the processional deities were taken to Padalakatta on Sunday morning and the temple priest slit his thigh with a knife and offered blood to Lord Mala Malleswara Swamy.On reaching Sri Baaveswara temple, the priest who stood under the Banni tree foretold the future and predicted the prices of various crops grown in the region including cotton, Johar, coriander etc.Finally, the Lord's procession reached the Simhasana katta, where the priests performed special rituals, marking the conclusion of this year's Banni festival.While three deaths were reported at the Banni festival last year, the elaborate security arrangements made by the Kurnool district police wing this year, ensured that the Banni festival passed off smoothly without any major untoward incidents on Saturday-Sunday.Kurnool SP G Bindu Madhav stated that the district police wing had deployed about 800 police personnel , over a 100 high resolution CC cameras and also used about five drone cameras for the first time, which helped avert major bloodshed this year during the Banni festival at Devaragattu.",Over 70 injured at Devaragattu Banni stick festival during Dussehra celebrations.

This was the third attempt on the former president's life since July.“I truly do believe we prevented another assassination attempt,” Bianco told reporters on Sunday.The suspect, Vem Miller, was apprehended at a checkpoint about a mile from the rally site, armed with a loaded shotgun, handgun, and high-capacity magazine, according to police.

Climber Sandy Irvine’s remains found on Mount Everest after 100 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/climber-sandy-irvines-remains-found-on-mount-everest-after-100-years/articleshow/114188063.cms,"British Climber Sandy Irvine (Left) and apparently his foot (Right) (AP Images)

The mystery of Irvine , who vanished into clouds as mist swept over the Himalayan Summit, was finally solved after 100 years when the National Geographic team spotted a boot melting out of the ice on Mount Everest in September.Andrew ""Sandy"" Ivrine disappeared on Everest on June 8 1924 along with his partner George Mallory while attempting to become the first people to climb the world’s highest peak, the National Geographic said in a report.The team of National Geographic, in September, stumbled on a preserved boot, revealed by melting ice on a glacier. After examining the boot closely, they discovered a sock with ""a red label that has A.C. IRVINE stitched into it.""This discovery could provide further clues about the location of the team's personal effects and may help resolve the mystery of whether Irvine and Mallory ever reached the summit, nearly three decades before the first recognised summit by Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953.His partner Mallory’s remains were located in 1999, while the whereabouts of Irvine’s were unknown.“It's the first real evidence of where Sandy ended up,” National Geographic documentary director Jimmy Chin said. “A lot of theories have been put out there.” He hopes the discovery helps explain what happened on the mountain in 1924, and brings some closure to Irvine’s relatives who revere him still.“When someone disappears and there’s no evidence of what happened to them, it can be really challenging for families. And just having some definitive information of where Sandy might’ve ended up is certainly [helpful], and also a big clue for the climbing community as to what happened,” he added.Irvine's great-niece, Julie Summers, was moved to tears upon learning of the discovery, stating, ""It tells the whole story about what probably happened.""The Irvine family has offered to share DNA samples to confirm the identity of the remains. Irvine was only 22 years old when he went missing on June 8, 1924, during the final ascent to the summit with Mallory, according to National Geographic .Earlier this year, Mallory's final letter to his wife was digitized and published online by Cambridge University, revealing his doubts about their chances of reaching the summit.Irvine is believed to have been carrying a vest camera, the discovery of which could rewrite mountaineering history. Climb team member and National Geographic explorer Jimmy Chin did not disclose the exact location of the remains to discourage trophy hunters but “it certainly reduces the search area.”","Andrew ""Sandy"" Ivrine disappeared on Everest on June 8 1924 along with his partner George Mallory.

In a discussion focused on potential election-related chaos, Trump expressed confidence that his supporters would not contribute to unrest.During a press interaction, a reporter pressed Trump on the possibility of disturbances, particularly from external agitators.“Are you expecting chaos on election day?” the reporter asked.“No, I don't think so. Not from the side that votes for Trump,” Trump replied, dismissing fears of violence stemming from his supporters.The conversation then shifted to potential threats from outside actors. Citing the presence of thousands of Chinese nationals and individuals on terrorist watchlists in the US, Trump was questioned whether these elements could spark violence, especially if Trump emerged victorious. President Joe Biden ’s remarks suggesting that the upcoming election might not be peaceful were also referenced.Trump, accusing Biden of ignorance, said, “Well, he does not have any idea what is happening as he spends most of his days sleeping. I think the bigger problem is the enemy from within. Not even people who come and destroy our country, by the way, totally destroying our country. The towns, villages, they're being inundated. But I don't know if there will be problems in terms of election day.”Trump insisted that any unrest should be addressed with decisive action, stating, “I think the bigger problem is the people from within. We have some very bad people. We've some sick people,radical left lunatics. And I think it should be very easily handled by, if necessary, the National Guard or, if really necessary, by the military because they can't let that happen.”Trump's remarks come as tensions rise ahead of the upcoming election, with both major parties gearing up for what many anticipate could be a contentious process.President Joe Biden had earlier expressed doubts about the likelihood of peaceful elections in November. He pointed to what he called ""inflammatory remarks"" made by Trump, the Republican candidate, who continues to deny the legitimacy of his loss in the 2020 presidential race. The 81-year-old president suggested that while he believes the election will be “free and fair,” he cannot guarantee it will be “peaceful.”","Former US President Donald Trump suggested that military forces might be necessary to address what he termed “the enemy from within” on Election Day.

Pakistan is gearing up to secure its capital, Islamabad, ahead of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit. The event, taking place on Tuesday and Wednesday, will see the attendance of key regional leaders, including India's foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, Russia's Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and China's Premier Li Qiang.In preparation for the summit, Pakistan's government has implemented strict measures.These include strict enforcement against movements protesting ethnic nationalism and new laws that limit demonstrations in the capital. Authorities have also detained hundreds of supporters of opposition leader Imran Khan , who is currently jailed, following their attempt to march in Islamabad.Security concerns have been heightened by a recent attack on a convoy of Chinese engineers in Karachi, raising fears for the safety of foreign nationals amid ongoing separatist violence. The government has responded by authorizing troop deployments in the capital throughout the summit's duration.Imtiaz Gul, a security analyst, emphasized the importance of the summit for Pakistan, stating, ""The government claims to have made elaborate security arrangements and understandably so because it has to make sure that the event passes off peacefully without any untoward incident.""The SCO, which includes China, India, Russia, Pakistan, Iran, and six other member states, is viewed by some as an alternative to Western alliances such as NATO. The agenda for the Islamabad summit focuses on trade, humanitarian, and cultural issues, though domestic issues in Pakistan may loom large.The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, led by Imran Khan, has threatened protests during the summit. Ahsan Iqbal Chaudhary, Pakistan's minister for planning, accused the PTI of trying to disrupt the event, stating, ""The PTI doesn't want to showcase the positive side of Pakistan to the world. Instead, they aim to present a picture of the country filled with tear gas and unrest.""To facilitate the summit, Islamabad and the neighboring city of Rawalpindi will observe a public holiday starting Monday, accompanied by road closures to reduce movement. The government quarter hosting the summit has been fortified and prepared for the visiting dignitaries.Pakistan, heavily reliant on Chinese investment for infrastructure projects, is keen to ensure the safety of its citizens and foreign guests, especially considering the broader uptick in militancy linked to the Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan.The authorities aim for a peaceful summit to enhance the country's image amidst various internal and external challenges.","Pakistan is hosting a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit.

Huge stocks of baby oil, drugs were found at Diddy's sex den while Diddy did not plead guilty to the charges.Usher who once stayed with Diddy said his X account got hacked and that's why all his past posts disappeared. This happened as his old statement in which said he witnessed wild things when he stayed with Diddy resurfaced.Apart from Usher and Pink, Megan Fox deleted all her posts on Instagram and X triggering speculations over how she was linked to Diddy.An old snipped of Khloe Kardashian claiming that she attended one of Diddy's naked parties emerged. ""I got on a plane at 5:30 am. Well this party...I think half the people there were butt naked,"" this is exactly what Khloe said about Diddy's party.Diddy was Justin Bieber's mentor but Bieber's spokesperson said he is trying not to focus on the charges and accusation of Diddy. Justin is in a happy bubble since he became a father.As the list of the Hollywood A-listers becomes long, they are maintaining absolute silence over Diddy's arrest.An officer involved in the raid on Diddy's home compared him to Jeffrey Epstein, stating that Diddy was part of the same social circle as Epstein and Harvey Weinstein. The officer claimed there were 15 years of wild parties, suggesting that while not everyone who attended was complicit in trafficking, they witnessed inappropriate behavior. He emphasized that many people knew what went on, especially as things became more explicit late at night.Also read on the Diddy case:","No Hollywood A-lister has been implicated in the Sean Diddy trafficking case but several 'Diddy lists' are viral.

'She didn't sign up for this': What JD Vance said about 'dragging' Hindu wife Usha to Church,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/she-didnt-sign-up-for-this-what-jd-vance-said-about-dragging-hindu-wife-usha-to-church/articleshow/114180849.cms,"New York Times

Ohio Senator and Donald Trump's running mate, JD Vance has revealed he feels bad about bringing his wife, Usha Vance , to church every week, saying that ""she didn't sign up for this."" Vance said that Usha was raised in a Hindu household, has not converted to Catholicism despite attending Mass regularly.In an interview with the, Vance, admitted to feeling uncomfortable about how his religious journey has affected his wife.“I feel — felt — kind of bad,” he explained. “Like, ‘Oh, you didn’t sign up to marry a weekly churchgoer, and are you OK with this?’ And she was sort of more than OK with it, and that was a big part of the confirmation that this was the right thing for me.”Vance revealed that Usha encouraged him to explore Catholicism even though she did not follow the faith herself. “She thought that they were good for me, in a sort of good-for-your-soul kind of way,” he said. “I don’t think I would have ever done it without her support, because I felt kind of bad about it, right?”Reflecting on his spiritual growth, Vance shared his deeper motivations. “When I started to think about the big things, like, what do I actually care about in my life? I really want to be a good husband. I really want to be a good father. I really want to be a good member of the community. I wanted to be a virtuous human being, in other words.”Despite Usha's support, Vance acknowledged the pressures she faces. “I feel terrible for my wife because we go to church almost every Sunday, unless we’re on the road,” he said. He explained that although he helps with their children, Usha tends to feel the burden of keeping them quiet during the service. “Obviously, I help with the kids, but because I’m kind of the one going to church, she feels more responsibility to keep the kids quiet in the church.”Usha and JD Vance met at Yale Law School and married in Kentucky in 2014, with a Hindu priest presiding over a separate ceremony. They have three children. Usha has been pivotal in JD’s political career, helping him shape his thoughts on rural America’s social decline, which inspired his best-selling memoir, Hillbilly Elegy. The book was adapted into a 2020 film by Ron Howard.","Ohio Senator and Donald Trump's running mate, JD Vance has revealed he feels bad about bringing his wife, Usha Vance, to church every week.

Despite owning firearms, Miller admitted to being a novice with guns and never having fired one in his life.Miller said he was a Democrat growing up, and thought Barack Obama was going to ""save us from needless wars and censorship.""""I'm certainly more Republican now,"" he said, and described himself and his business partner as more libertarian.""Yes, I'm 100% a Trump supporter,"" Miller said, adding that he was ""all-in"" with Trump by 2018.""This is a man that I deeply admire, because I was a closet individual in terms of my beliefs, because I worked in Hollywood.

He told Fox Digital News that he carries documents with both his full Armenian name and abbreviated versions, as using certain documents in some parts of the world could put his life at risk due to historical campaigns targeting Armenians.Miller also addressed Sheriff Bianco's suggestion that he was part of the ""sovereign citizens"" movement, dismissing it as a ""nonsensical statement."" He denied any involvement in right-wing anti-government groups, challenging the sheriff to name specific groups and asserting that such accusations are baseless.Sources close to the Trump campaign have expressed doubts about the incident being an assassination attempt on the former president.

Mysterious UFO drones are reportedly surveilling America’s sensitive military sites, leaving the Pentagon struggling to take action against these aerial intruders, according to a recent report by the Wall Street Journal .Over the past year, unidentified drones have been spotted flying over military installations in Virginia and Nevada, including the secret base for the Navy’s elite SEAL Team Six and Naval Station Norfolk, the largest naval port in the world.However, federal laws prevent the military from shooting down these drones due to potential risks to troops and civilians.High-profile White House discussions have also ruled out jamming their signals, with concerns that such actions could disrupt emergency services, Wi-Fi networks, and commercial airliners, as reported by the New York Post.Former US Air Force general Mark Kelly was first alerted to drone sightings in December 2023, when Langley Air Force Base officials reported dozens of drones flying over the facility at night. These sightings continued for 17 days, prompting suspicions that Russian or Chinese agents might be involved.On January 6, 2024, a clue emerged when a Chinese student at the University of Minnesota, Fengyun Shi, was caught flying a drone near Langley. His drone, which had photographed Navy ships, was abandoned after getting stuck in a tree. Shi was arrested a week later as he prepared to board a flight to China and was charged with unlawfully photographing classified naval installations.While US officials have confirmed similar drone swarms near Edwards Air Force Base in Nevada, the Defence Department has yet to publicly identify those behind these apparent surveillance efforts.","Mysterious UFO drones are reportedly surveilling America’s sensitive military sites, leaving the Pentagon struggling to take action against these aerial intruders.

Former United States Representative Liz Cheney has said she regrets supporting Donald Trump after recently endorsing vice president Kamala Harris , as reported by USA Today .During a Sunday interview on ""Meet the Press"" with NBC's Kristen Welker, Cheney was asked whether she regretted her backing of Trump during the 2016 presidential election and in the years that followed while she served in Congress.Welker referenced a 2016 debate where Trump said, ""I'll tell you at the time. I'll keep you in suspense,"" when questioned about his commitment to a peaceful transfer of power.""Yes, I do,"" Cheney admitted. ""For, certainly, people after what he did on January 6 , to act as though you can have confidence in him, you know that that that simply is just not credible."" She condemned the events of January 6, calling the attack on the Capitol “brutal,” “depraved,” and “fundamentally cruel.”After being removed as chair of the House Republican Conference for her opposition to Donald Trump’s attempts to overturn the 2020 election results, Cheney has become a leading critic of him. She was one of ten Republicans who voted to impeach Trump for the Capitol attack and served as vice chair of the House select committee investigating the insurrection.Cheney's endorsement of Harris marks her continued efforts to support the Democratic nominee in the 2024 presidential race . Earlier this month, she campaigned alongside Harris in key states like Ripon and Wisconsin, urging voters from all backgrounds to support the vice president.Notably, Cheney's father, former vice president Dick Cheney, also said he will vote for Harris in November, showing a family break from traditional party lines.","Former U.S. Representative Liz Cheney has said she regrets supporting Donald Trump.

American actor Dennis Quaid , known for his role in the film ""Reagan,"" rallied for former US President Donald Trump in Coachella , California, on Saturday, addressing a crowd in the deep blue Democratic state which used to be vice president Kamala Harris 's stronghold, as reported by Fox News .“God bless you. God bless America. I'm here today to tell you that it's time to pick a side,” Quaid said, standing on the stage.“Are we going to be a nation that stands for the Constitution? Or for TikTok? Are we going to be a nation of law and order? Or wide open borders? Which is it? Because it's time to pick a side.”Speaking in the desert city, Quaid noted his recent portrayal of President Ronald Reagan in a 2024 biopic. He compared the political situation during Reagan's election to the present day, mentioning similar problems like inflation and the country's decline.“It’s amazing how the issues of the 1980 election are very similar to what they are today,” he said, recounting the challenges America faced during Reagan's presidency. “Ronald Reagan came along and said, no, we're not a nation in decline. We're going there. And we followed him. The same with Trump.”Quaid shared a funny story about how he was kicked out of the ""hippies"" after voting for Reagan. He posed a question Reagan famously asked, “Are you better off than you were four years ago?”The actor praised Trump’s achievements, saying, “When Trump left office, inflation was low and there was peace in the Middle East.” He expressed concern about the current reliance on foreign energy and criticised Biden's administration for its oil policies.Concluding his speech, Quaid shared a personal story about his housekeeper, Josie, an undocumented immigrant who has since secured her green card.

Each typically includes six truck-mounted launchers, 48 interceptors, and radar and communication systems, requiring 95 soldiers for operation.

Tech billionaire Elon Musk could play a major role in a potential second Donald Trump administration, according to the former US president, who revealed plans for a unique position during a Fox News interview on Sunday.In a conversation with Maria Bartiromo on 'Sunday Morning Futures', Donald Trump praised Musk, calling him “a great business guy” and “a great cost-cutter.” He added, “He [Musk] said, ‘I could cut costs without affecting anybody.’”When asked if Musk would join his Cabinet should he return to office, Trump clarified, “He doesn’t want to be in the Cabinet.He just wants to be in charge of cost-cutting. We’ll have a new position: Secretary of Cost-Cutting.”Trump went on to highlight Musk's ambitious space ventures, saying, “He’s made me a promise to get to Mars before the end of my administration, which will be long before, hopefully, China or Russia.” Trump referenced Space Force , which he established in 2019, saying, “It’s now going to be one of our most important things.”Musk recently appeared on the Trump campaign trail, wearing a “Dark MAGA” hat and a t-shirt with the slogan “Occupy Mars.” His first appearance took place in Butler, Pennsylvania, where Trump narrowly escaped assassination in July. Musk used the platform to warn against a potential Kamala Harris presidency, claiming it would threaten free speech. “This is no ordinary election,” Musk told supporters. “The other side wants to take away your freedom of speech.”Trump mentioned that Musk has been actively campaigning for him in the key battleground state. “He’s actually campaigning because he says, ‘If we don’t win, we’re not going to have a country.’”The former president expressed his determination, saying, “We just have to win.

TOI correspondent from Washington:

The top American general who served during Donald Trump 's presidency says he is ""fascist to the core"" and the ""most dangerous person ever."" Trump's own niece Mary Trump says he has ""aways been for sale"" and billionaire tech-bro Elon Musk is the new owner. The actor Jeff Daniels, who's ""America is not great"" screed of US in a tv serial became a global viral hit, says Trump rallies are where people go to get away from their conscience.Outside the MAGA echo-chamber, Trump take-downs are relentless across America. Yet, not a vote seems to have moved in the US Presidential polls, with most credible surveys showing the two candidates virtually tied. There are marginal shifts in the lead in the seven battleground states, but every state is within a normal-sized polling error of 3.5 points and could swing either way. An NBC poll put them at 48-48 nationwide, with only a ""sliver of undecideds"" remaining to make up their mind.Beyond polling, the campaign has become even more mean and toxic, pandering to partisans with ever uglier swipes. In some of the most vicious language ever used by a presidential candidate, Trump reportedly called Kamala Harris ""retarded"" in a meeting with his donors, even as his MAGA mob yelled ""She's a Ho'"" at a rally in Coachella, California, where Trump replayed the dark, dystopian view of the US overrun by illegal immigrants.Liberal hacks meanwhile taunted Trump with memes about his purported incontinence, including a fake post where the former President contests videos in which a loud tooting sound is heard. Trump critics were in full flow this week with fetid stories about ""Diaper Don"" and his problem with incontinence, citing his former personal staff and associates on his show The Apprentice.Meanwhile, the movie The Apprentice centering on Trump opened in movieplexes across America to acclaim from movie critics but blistering criticism from the MAGA crowd, including threats of legal action by Trump lawyers for its negative portrayal of a young Trump. Among other things, the movie suggests Trump had a homo-erotic relationship with a sleazy lawyer named Ray Cohn who was his mentor and show him sexually assaulting his first wife Ivana Trump after she calls him fat and balding.None of this appears to be making the slightest dent in support for a man who once boasted that he could shoot someone in the middle of New York City's Fifth Avenue and still not lose any votes. If anything, the relentless trashing to Trump seems to be consolidating support for a candidate seen as fighting the ""establishment.""In fact, Trump supporters over the weekend unloaded on one of the country's top generals, former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff Mark Milley , who is quoted as describing the former President as a ""total fascist"" in Bob Woodward 's new book. “I had suspicions when I talked to you about his mental decline and so forth, but now I realize he's a total fascist. He's now the most dangerous person to this country. A fascist to the core,” Milley tells Woodward.But the MAGA mob has now turned on Milley, calling him a traitor who should be tried by a military tribunal because, according to them, he withheld nuclear codes from Trump when he was the President and alerted China that he would give them a head's up if Trump decided to launch a war.In fact, revenge is a recurring theme among Trump supporters if he returns as president, a result they believe is inevitable. Trump himself has repeatedly said he will accept the results of the election only if he wins. A recent Pew survey in fact showed that 72% of voters say if Harris loses she will accept the results and acknowledge Trump’s victory. Virtually all Harris supporters (95%) and about half of Trump supporters (48%) expect Harris to concede. But just 24% say if Trump loses he will concede, while 74% say he will not. About half of Trump supporters (46%) and only 4% of Harris supporters expect Trump to acknowledge Harris as the election winner.","Donald Trump's campaign has become even more mean and toxic, pandering to partisans with ever uglier swipes.

The injured were taken to a hospital.Pir Haider Ali Shah, a former parliamentarian and member of a tribal council, said elders had arrived in Kurram to mediate a peace agreement between the tribes.""The recent firing incidents are regrettable and have hampered efforts for lasting peace,"" he said.Notably, tribal group meetings also known as 'Jirgas' are routinely held to ensure peace and stability in the region, as reported by Al Jazeera.In another incident last month, at least 25 people were killed in days of clashes between armed Shia and Sunni Muslims over a land dispute.Although both communities live together largely peacefully in the country, tensions have existed for decades between them in some areas, especially in Kurram, where Shia Muslims dominate in parts of the district, according to Al Jazeera.Clashes in the area have seen an uptick as last month alone over 20 people were killed between armed Shia and Sunni Muslims over a land dispute.Although both live together largely peacefully in the country, tensions have existed for decades between them in some areas, especially in Kurram, where Shia Muslims dominate in parts of the district, Al Jazeera noted.Meanwhile, on Saturday, the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for attacks at a coal mine in Balochistan which saw the death of over 20 individuals including Pakistani as well as Afghan nationals. The attack had involved the use of heavy weapons, rocket launchers and grenades.Such attacks have become common in Balochistan, the southern part of the country known to be home to key natural resources but whose benefits do not translate to uplifting the citizens' quality of life there.The outfits operating from Balochistan accuse the central government in Islamabad of exploiting the province's rich oil and mineral resources to the detriment of the local population in the country's largest and least-populated province, which borders Iran and Afghanistan.These groups have also expressed their anger against foreign nationals coming in for resource extraction but deriving profits without benefiting the locals. Attacks on international convoys have thus become a key way for citizens to register protests.BLA gave a higher casualty figure of 30 dead and 18 injured in the incident. It also said that Pakistani security personnel were disguised as workers, without giving evidence.It threatened more assaults unless the military withdrew from the province.Balochistan has been a hotbed of armed movements, with the BLA most prominent among them.Last week, the BLA - designated a ""terrorist group"" by Pakistan, the United Kingdom and the United States - claimed responsibility for an attack targeting Chinese nationals near Pakistan's largest airport, Al Jazeera reported.The Chinese embassy in Pakistan said at least two of its citizens were killed and a third injured after their convoy was targeted with an improvised explosive device believed to have been detonated by a suicide bomber.At least 10 people were injured in total, with four cars destroyed in the explosion and 10 more vehicles damaged in the resulting fire, local media reported.",Tensions rose in the Kurram district of the province after two people were critically injured in a shooting incident.

Imran Khan: Pakistan government warns of force if Imran Khan's party stages protest during SCO summit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-government-warns-of-force-if-imran-khans-party-stages-protest-during-sco-summit/articleshow/114174705.cms,"Representative Image (Picture credit: AP)

ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan government on Saturday warned to use force if jailed former prime minister Imran Khan 's party went ahead to hold a protest in Islamabad on the occasion of Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit. The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf's (PTI) politic committee, comprising of its key members, decided to hold a protest at D-Chowk in the capital on Tuesday if the government failed to meet its demand to give the 72-year-old former cricketer-turned-politician access to his legal team and a physician, spokesman Zulfiqar Bukhari said.The authorities due to security concerns stopped all meetings with Khan, who has been incarcerated in Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail , after the protest by the party over the last weekend.Defence Minister Khawaja Asif warned that the government would use ""full force"" to stop the PTI's planned protest on the occasion of the SCO summit .""The call for protest on October 15 is an attack on the integrity of the country. We will not allow [anyone] to damage the honour and reputation of the country. The state will use all of its power and resources to prevent the invasion of Islamabad,"" said Asif while speaking to the media in Sialkot.The politician also called for the courts to intervene and take notice of the matter. ""Do the courts not see what the PTI founder is doing with the integrity of the country? The actions of the judiciary today will determine their role in history,"" he said.Separately, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal condemned the protest call by terming it "" political terrorism "" which is aimed at maligning the country. Addressing a press conference in Islamabad, he expressed disappointment at the timing of the protest.""Now there is no doubt that terrorism in Karachi and political terrorism protest calls are similar,"" the minister said, adding that both aimed to destabilise the country.Iqbal said the PTI was destroying the economy of the country and urged the party supporters to see the harm caused by their actions.""The PTI is attempting to undermine the government's economic recovery efforts. It's crucial to acknowledge the damage caused by these actions and consider the consequences of supporting policies that hinder Pakistan's growth and development,"" he said.The minister also stated that the country cannot afford destructive politics. ""Just because the PTI's leader is jailed, doesn't justify chaos,"" he said.Separately, federal minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit Baltistan Amir Muqam also strongly rejected the PTI's protest call. ""It is proof of anti-nationalism. There is no doubt that PTI's agenda seems to be anti-Pakistan because the party has declared the protest on this important occasion,"" he said.However, the PTI was in no mood to back off and Bukhari said the party was not against any foreign visit but ""this illegitimate government"" was trying to create a false case of normality when ""a former prime minister and leader of the largest party is illegally in prison (according to the UN) along with his wife"".""And to top it off, he has been banned to meet his legal team, doctor or family, which is against all human rights conventions and our constitution. Issues at home need to be solved before faking business as usual. Our only demand is let a doctor or sister meet Imran khan. That's all. It's completely illegal and unacceptable. And the world should know it,"" he said.The 23rd SCO summit has been scheduled to be held on October 15 and 16 and several leaders, including Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, Chinese Premier Li Qiang, Iranian first vice president Reza Aref, Indian external affairs Minister S Jaishankar and other leaders from member states are expected to attend.The government has deployed more than 10,000 police and paramilitary personnel for the security of about 900 delegates coming to Islamabad. It also deployed army troops under Article 245 of the Constitution, to bolster security measures in Islamabad from October 5 to 17.The federal government has also announced a three-day holiday in the capital starting from October 14 to ensure the safety and protection of delegates attending the summit. The Punjab government has imposed Section 144 in the Rawalpindi district from October 10 to 17.",The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf's (PTI) politic committee decided to hold a protest at D-Chowk in the capital on Tuesday. The government failed to meet its demand to give the 72-year-old former cricketer-turned-politician access to his legal team and a physician.
