Army teams are carrying out rescue operations in Dharali and the nearby Sukhi Top area.

'Will call PM Modi': Brazil's Lula snubs Trump amid tariff row; rejects offer to reach out,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-call-pm-modi-brazils-lula-snubs-trump-amid-tariff-row-rejects-offer-to-reach-out/articleshow/123132286.cms,"Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has said he will confront Donald Trump’s 50% tariffs head-on, while reaffirming Brazil’s global standing by announcing plans to personally contact world leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi. ““I will call him, I will call Xi Jinping, I will call Prime Minister Modi. I just won’t call Putin, because Putin can’t travel right now,” Lula said during a public event in Brasília, according to TRT Global. “I will call Trump to invite him to come to the COP because I want to know what he thinks about the climate issue. I will have the courtesy to call.”Despite tensions between Brasília and Washington, Lula has made it clear that his administration would use every available avenue – including the World Trade Organization – to challenge Trump’s new 50% tariff on Brazilian goods. “In 2025, we will resort to all possible measures, starting with the WTO, to defend our interests,” he said.Trump’s decision, signed into effect last week, comes amid his vocal defence of former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, who faces prosecution for allegedly plotting a coup to overturn the 2022 election. Lula has rejected any suggestion that the legal proceedings against Bolsonaro are up for negotiation.“Maybe he doesn't know that here in Brazil, the judiciary is independent,” Lula told The New York Times. “The former president is being tried with a full right to a defence. ”Lula also said Trump's justification for the tariffs, supposedly to protect Bolsonaro and punish judicial overreach, was an attack on Brazil’s sovereignty. “There’s no reason to be afraid,” Lula said in the Times interview. “But at no point will Brazil negotiate as if it were a small country up against a big country.”Brazil’s economy appears better equipped than most to absorb the blow, with Reuters noting that exemptions for key exports like aircraft and orange juice mean the tariffs would affect just under 36% of Brazilian exports to the US by value. Lula’s government is also preparing aid for sectors hit hardest, and trade with China and BRICS nations now makes up a far greater share of Brazil’s exports.Still, Lula warned of the political costs of Trump’s unilateral move. “Neither the American people nor the Brazilian people deserve this,” he said. “We are going to move from a 201-year-old diplomatic relationship of win-win to a political relationship of lose-lose.”","Lula says he will personally contact world leaders, including Narendra Modi.

NEW DELHI: National Security Advisor Ajit Doval reached Moscow on Tuesday to hold talks on strategic partnership, defence, and security cooperation between India and Russia, Russian news agency TASS reported.His visit comes as the Trump-led US administration continues to issue trade threats to countries closely aligned with Russia, including India.This is a scheduled visit with discussions focused on defence cooperation between the two nations. ""The current escalation of the geopolitical situation will also be discussed. Apart from that the topics will include such pressing matters as supplies of Russian oil [to India],"" the source told TASS.Earlier this month, US President Donald Trump announced plans to impose a 25 per cent tariff on India as a “penalty.” He also said India and Russia could “take their dead economies down together,” prompting India to reiterate that it remains the world’s fastest-growing major economy.Trump further stated that India has ""always bought a vast majority of their military equipment from Russia,"" and is ""Russia’s largest buyer of energy, along with China.""On Monday, the ministry of external affairs (MEA) described criticism from the US and EU over India’s imports of Russian oil as “unjustified,” pointing out that Western countries had previously supported such trade to stabilise global energy markets and still continue purchasing goods and services from Russia.“India will take all necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security,” the MEA said, noting that the US and EU have continued trade with Russia, including in energy and key commodities, despite publicly opposing the Ukraine conflict.The MEA also pointed to “double standards,” highlighting that EU trade with Russia in 2024 was significantly higher than India’s.","National Security Advisor Ajit Doval reached Moscow on Tuesday to hold talks on strategic partnership, defence, and security cooperation.

But all four corporations decided to go ahead with the protest.The strike is being held over demands including the release of 38 months of unpaid salaries, implementation of wage revision from January 1, 2024, opposition to privatisation, end to worker harassment, and a demand that company drivers be assigned to electric buses as well.Talks between the government and transport unions had failed before the strike.The high court had issued an interim stay on the strike on Monday, saying that a complete halt of public transport would cause hardship to the public. However, the unions have decided to go ahead with their protest.Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah had urged the workers to cancel the strike. However, union leaders said the government’s offer to clear only two years of arrears was not acceptable and that there was no clear assurance on salary revision.KSRTC Staff and Workers' Federation president H V Anantha Subbarao said, as quoted by PTI, ""We are not satisfied. We want full 38 months' arrears.""",Buses stopped running from 6.00 am after workers of Bengaluru Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) and three others went on strike.

"370 abrogation anniversary: ‘New J&K’ for LG, ‘Black Day’ for others",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/370-abrogation-anniversary-new-jk-for-lg-black-day-for-others/articleshow/123126628.cms,"SRINAGAR/JAMMU: The sixth anniversary of Article 370’s abrogation drew contrasting responses Tuesday with J&K lieutenant-governor Manoj Sinha asserting the move heralded the “birth of a new Jammu and Kashmir” and most parties, barring BJP, protesting the “Black Day”.“On Aug 5, 2019, dismantling of the terror ecosystem began. The new J&K is one where tears are not shed on deaths of terrorists but tears of common Kashmiris are wiped away,” Sinha said at Srinagar’s Sheri Kashmir Convention Centre, handing over 158 job letters to kin of civilians killed by terrorists over the years.The Centre-appointed LG painted a picture of robust security and responsive administration after the abrogation of J&K’s special status and statehood as well as the region’s conversion into a Union Territory, saying the long wait for justice and healing was over for families of terror victims. “They (job recipients) have come out to reveal the role of Pakistani terrorists and the terror ecosystem in J&K.”Barely 10km from the convention centre where Sinha spoke, the mood was not as bright as the governing National Conference (NC) and opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) decried the abrogation. While the two parties were not permitted to hold public marches, both held protests in their offices.“This day is a Black Day for us.There should be a restoration of statehood and democratic rights. Even BJP knows it was not a good decision and that’s the reason they keep us locked up on this day,” senior NC functionary Salman Sagar said.PDP president and former CM Mehbooba Mufti, also barred from leading a march, echoed the “Black Day” condemnation. “J&K has been turned into a laboratory. They subverted the Constitution here and later started similar experiments in other states. You are now seeing the SIR (voter roll revision) exercise in Bihar. I want to tell the people of India their situation could become worse than ours. No one will come to their aid, just like no one is helping us,” Mehbooba said.Peoples Conference chief and MLA Sajad Gani Lone described “Aug 5 as a brutal reminder of undermining of democracy, an ugly example of selective targeting”.In Jammu, NC, PDP and Congress workers hit the streets. Congress leaders garlanded a statue of the last J&K Dogra ruler Maharaja Hari Singh. Party workers sported black ribbons and raised slogans against the Centre and BJP for delay in restoration of statehood.“Today’s protest is part of our intensified campaign to seek restoration of pride and glory of this historic Dogra state, which was destroyed by BJP on Aug 5, 2019,” J&K Congress working president Raman Bhalla said. Chief party spokesperson Ravinder Sharma accused BJP of undermining the elected NC govt and running the administration through LG Sinha as “remote control” .If the opposition staged demonstrations, BJP organised celebrations, hailing Aug 5 as a day of “collective achievement”. J&K BJP chief Sat Sharma told a gathering in Jammu’s Akhnoor the abrogation had brought constitutional unity and equal rights. “This day led to the welfare of neglected and oppressed communities of J&K,” Sharma said.","The sixth anniversary of Article 370’s abrogation drew contrasting responses Tuesday.

More than 7,000 people have been infected with chikungunya, a mosquito-borne virus, in China’s Guangdong province since July.The outbreak has prompted strict containment measures similar to those used during the Covid-19 pandemic, reports BBC.Foshan, the epicenter of the outbreak, has implemented mandatory hospitalisation for confirmed patients, requiring them to remain in beds covered with mosquito nets. Patients are only discharged after a week or upon testing negative.The virus spreads through mosquito and causes fever and severe joint pain. The pain can last for months or even years.According to authorities, 12 other cities in Guangdong have reported cases, and nearly 3,000 new infections were recorded just last week. Hong Kong also reported its first case—a 12-year-old boy who had travelled to Foshan, BBC reported.Officials state that 95% of reported cases have been mild, with patients recovering in under a week.In response to the outbreak, the US has advised travelers to China to exercise “increased caution.”Local authorities have intensified mosquito control operations, urging residents to get rid of stagnant water and seek medical care if symptoms appear.Non-compliance can lead to fines of up to 10,000 yuan (around $1,400). Additionally, thousands of mosquito larvae-eating fish have been released in Foshan lakes, and drones and predatory “elephant mosquitoes” are being used to locate and reduce breeding sites.The aggressive containment tactics have drawn comparisons to China's earlier pandemic protocols.Chikungunya symptoms typically appear 3 to 7 days after a bite and include fever, rash, muscle pain, and swollen joints. While most cases resolve in about a week, joint pain can persist, especially in vulnerable groups like infants, seniors, and people with underlying conditions. There is no cure, though fatalities are rare.","More than 7,000 people have been infected with chikungunya in China's Guangdong province since July.

US President Donald Trump has indicated that Vice President JD Vance is “most likely” to be the political heir to the MAGA movement in 2028, while also floating Secretary of State Marco Rubio as a potential figure in future Republican leadership.In a recent interview, Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy asked Trump, ""You could clear the entire Republican field right now. Do you agree that the heir apparent to MAGA is JD Vance?""“Well, I think most likely. In all fairness, he's the vice president,” Trump replied.Trump also brought up Marco Rubio as a key figure in future Republican leadership. “I think Marco is also somebody that maybe would get together with JD in some form,” he said.“I also think we have some incredible people on the stage right here. So it's too early obviously to talk about it but certainly he's doing a great job and he would be probably favourite at this point,” Trump added.In a May interview with MSNBC, Trump praised Vance but declined to make any official announcement about 2028. “It — it could very well be — I — I don’t want to get involved in that. I think he’s a fantastic, brilliant guy.Marco is great. But certainly you would say that somebody’s the VP, if that person is outstanding, I guess that person would have an advantage,” Trump said.Meanwhile, in a seperate interview months ago, Trump expressed interest in running again himself. He refused to endorse Vance outright and said he continues to receive requests from party members to consider a 2028 bid — even though the US Constitution limits presidents to two terms.Trump claimed there are “many loopholes” that could make a third term possible and insisted he was “not joking” when he previously floated the idea.

KOZHIKODE: Police have registered a suo motu case after a video surfaced on social media showing a group of men threatening a Christian pastor in Sulthan Bathery, Wayanad and accusing him of attempting religious conversion.The men, allegedly affiliated with the Sangh Parivar, can be seen issuing violent threats, warning the pastor not to visit Hindu households again.The incident reportedly took place in April, but no case was registered at the time as no formal complaint was filed. It came to light only after the video began circulating widely on social media, especially following the recent arrest of nuns in Chhattisgarh.In the video, about six men are seen blocking the pastor’s vehicle, shouting abuse and threatening him. One man is heard saying, “If you enterHindu homes again, there won’t be any more beatings. Your legs will be chopped off.” According to sources, the pastor had travelled to the Cherukad tribal hamlet to invite children to a vacation class when the group confronted him. An attempt was also allegedly made to physically assault him.Police have now registered a case under multiple sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), including Section 192 (wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot), Section 351(3) (criminal intimidation), and Section 3(5) (offences committed by severalpeople in furtherance of a common intention).The first information report notes that the accused not only issued serious threats but also deliberately filmed and shared the video on social media to incite communal unrest.Police have made contact with the pastor and are working to identify the individuals involved. A detailed investigation is underway to verify the sequence of events and determine if others were part of the incident. Meanwhile, BJP leaders have stated that the individuals seen in the video are not associated with the Sangh Parivar.","A video surfaced on social media showing a group of men threatening a Christian pastor.

The rod pierced through the rickshaw and into the passenger's head, leaving him covered in blood. Despite the severity of the injury, he remained conscious.Learning about the incident, the police, with the help of the autorickshaw driver, rushed the injured person to the private Nobel Hospital, where he is undergoing treatment. After learning about the incident, local workers of the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) staged a road blockade protest to express their anger.The MNS workers demanded that a criminal case be filed against the contractor concerned. The police are investigating the cause of the accident and determining who is responsible.The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) imposed a total penalty of Rs 55 lakh on two companies involved in the construction of Metro Line 5 after the tie rod from the site fell on the autorickshaw and left the passenger injured.While a Rs 50 lakh fine was levied on civil contractor Afcons, the general consultant, Systra-CEG-Systra (India), was penalised Rs 5 lakh for supervisory lapses.The incident took place two months after the tie rod—part of a temporary support structure to a deck slab—was installed. It gave way unexpectedly, crashing on to the auto and injuring the commuter on board.An independent inquiry has now been initiated under the chief safety manager of AICA, the general consultant for Metro Line 2B, to ensure a neutral and expert inquiry. Further action will follow based on the findings, MMRDA said.Following the incident, safety heads of both Afcons and Systra rushed to the hospital where the injured passenger was admitted, and MMRDA directed Afcons to bear the full cost of medical treatment and provide additional support to the victim.An MMRDA official said, ""We deeply regret the incident. Public safety and accountability are paramount to us. Immediate steps have been taken not only to penalise those at fault but also to identify systemic gaps and plug them.""",The accident occurred at the construction site of the Thane-Bhiwandi-Kalyan Metro Line 5.

DEHRADUN: At least nine personnel of the Indian Army were feared missing after a mudslide hit their base camp in Harsil valley near Indo-China border in Uttarkashi district around 220km away from Dehradun on Tuesday afternoon. Two others, who too were earlier missing, were later safely rescued.The mudslide struck after around 45 minutes of the disaster in Dharali village - about 4km from the Army camp in Harsil valley.Elaborating, public relations officer (defence), Dehradun, Lt Col Manish Srivastava said that the missing personnel were attached to the 14 Rajputana Rifles which were stationed at the Army camp.The unit’s base camp was adversely affected after being hit by a mudslide in which nine are feared missing. A search and rescue operation has been launched, even as around 150 other personnel of the unit are currently involved in the primary rescue operation led by commanding officer of the unit, Col Harshvardhan in Dharali,” said Lt Col Srivastava.Another Army officer, privy to the details, told TOI, “As per the preliminary information, there are no officers among those missing.”“That assessment would be done later as the first priority is to find those missing and take necessary steps to ensure others are safe in case of a similar emergency amid the ongoing heavy rains,” said the officer.The Army base in Harsil is largely aimed at ensuring required security arrangements and to cater to any military emergency at the India-China border which is 20-25 km away from there. It is located in close proximity to a camp of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police.Earlier in the day, commanding officer of Joshimath-based Ibex Brigade, Brig Mandeep Singh Dhillon, while briefing about the ongoing Dharali rescue operation being carried out by the Army personnel from Harsil base, said that it was hit by a mudslide. He had, however, not mentioned any missing personnel in the incident.“Despite this, the Army is determined to carry out the rescue operation at Dharali after reaching within 10 minutes of the tragedy. Due to the close proximity to Harsil camp, they were the first to reach there and initiate a search and rescue operation,” said Brig Singh.","The mudslide struck after around 45 minutes of the disaster in Dharali village - about 4km from the Army camp in Harsil valley.

NRL ’s Jack de Belin confronts lying officer whose false testimony shook his life and career



Jack de Belin’s closure awaits



Jack de Belin, once at the center of one of the most high-profile s*xual assault cases in Australian sport, returned to a very different courtroom this week. The St George Illawarra Dragons forward stood quietly in Wollongong District Court, watching as the former NSW police officer who nearly derailed his career pleaded for mercy. The confrontation came years after the officer, known only as ""Officer A"" due to a suppression order, gave false evidence under oath during de Belin’s pre-trial proceedings.The case dates back to 2018, when de Belin and his friend Callan Sinclair were accused of s*xually assaulting a 19-year-old woman. Both men insisted the encounter was consensual, and after two mistrials, the Director of Public Prosecutions dropped the charges altogether. But while the legal case ended, its consequences rippled through their lives, especially de Belin’s, who was sidelined from the NRL for three years under the league’s no-fault stand-down policy.Now, the focus has shifted to Officer A, who played a huge role in the case’s early stages. The officer accessed de Belin’s seized phone and reviewed over 200 text messages, 190 of which were protected communications between de Belin and his lawyer, Craig Osborne.At a pre-trial hearing in 2020, Officer A swore under oath that the messages were only related to ""Dragons business."" That statement, as he later admitted, was false.“He deliberately misled the court,” Crown prosecutor Ciro Triscari said during the sentencing hearing. “This represents a serious example of perjury when one considers the position occupied by the offender in question. The proceedings are serious criminal proceedings where the liberty of individuals was at stake.”De Belin’s legal team argued that the breach of privilege compromised his right to a fair trial, though their request to stay proceedings was ultimately rejected. Despite the eventual dismissal of charges, the damage was already done.Officer A has since pleaded guilty to perjury and now awaits sentencing on September 12. His lawyer, Dr. Peggy Dwyer, argued that he was suffering from severe post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at the time. “There can be no doubt he was suffering from PTSD in February and that it impacted his capacity to give evidence,” she told the court. She described the false statement as “an innocent mistake… made in a moment of panic. ”But prosecutors aren’t buying it. They countered with evidence suggesting Officer A’s mental health didn’t impair his ability to testify truthfully. Instead, they claim it was a calculated decision to mislead the court and protect the prosecution’s case.Also Read: Donald Trump signs executive order to create 2028 Olympics task force for LA Games While Officer A seeks leniency, perhaps serving time via an Intensive Correction Order, de Belin hasn’t spoken publicly about the hearing yet.","NRL's Jack de Belin confronts lying officer who nearly derailed his career.

‘Remains hopeful’: Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs’ lawyer seeks Trump’s pardon; Combs to remain jailed till sentencing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/remains-hopeful-sean-diddy-combs-lawyer-seeks-trumps-pardon-combs-to-remain-jailed-till-sentencing/articleshow/123130848.cms,"Sean ""Diddy"" Combs (AP)





Nicole Westmoreland, a member of Sean “Diddy” Combs’ high-profile legal team, said on Tuesday that the team has contacted the Trump administration to explore the possibility of a presidential pardon. This follows Combs’ recent conviction on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution.“It’s my understanding that we’ve reached out and had conversations in reference to a pardon,” Westmoreland said in an interview with CNN.US President Donald Trump suggested he was unlikely to pardon Combs in an interview with Newsmax last week. “I was very friendly with him, I got along with him great and he seemed like a nice guy. I didn’t know him well. But when I ran for office, he was very hostile,” he said.Despite Trump’s remarks, Westmoreland said this week that Combs “is a very hopeful person, and I believe that he remains hopeful.”Westmoreland has added that the case should never have been pursued by the government, arguing that their second misstep was “allowing it to keep it going.”“The government knew that there was no way Combs committed sex trafficking or RICO and they just continued prosecuting anyway,” she said.“I think the jury saw through it.”Combs has remained in custody since his arrest in September. While he was acquitted last month of the more serious charges of racketeering and sex trafficking, he was found guilty on two counts related to prostitution, reports AP.Judge Arun Subramanian on Monday rejected Combs' $50 million bond request, ruling that the music mogul failed to demonstrate he was neither a flight risk nor a danger.The judge also noted that Combs had not shown any “exceptional circumstance” that would justify release after a conviction that normally requires detention. Combs will remain in custody and will not be allowed to return home while awaiting sentencing.The conviction could result in a prison sentence of up to 10 years. However, sentencing will be guided by complex federal guidelines, on which there is significant disagreement between prosecutors and Combs’ legal team, reported AP.The judge wrote that Combs’ argument “might have traction in a case that didn’t involve evidence of violence, coercion or subjugation in connection with the acts of prostitution at issue, but the record here contains evidence of all three.”During the trial, four women testified against Combs that he had physically assaulted or sexually abused them.","Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' legal team has contacted the Trump administration to explore the possibility of a presidential pardon.

Director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has claimed that Russian officials privately anticipated a Hillary Clinton victory was “inevitable” in the 2016 US presidential election, based on her assessment of recently released documents by her office.Speaking on Miranda Devine’s “Pod Force One” podcast, Gabbard has said that Russia had a strategy of undermining public trust in the American political system while preparing for a Clinton-based White House, despite the prevailing narrative that Russia was in support of Donald Trump “It surprised me that all of these documents still existed, quite frankly,” she said on an episode that is scheduled to release on Wednesday, reports the New York Post. “As we’ve learned in later documents that we’ve reviewed throughout that campaign, Russia believed that Hillary Clinton would win the election.“They felt it was inevitable,” she added.Tulsi Gabbard’s office last month began releasing a series of internal documents detailing how officials navigated the investigation into Russian interference during the 2016 elections.Among the disclosures was a 2020 House Intelligence Committee report, which alleged that Russian operatives may have obtained intelligence suggesting Hillary Clinton was “placed on a daily regimen of ‘heavy tranquilizers’” and was “afraid of losing.”“If Russia aspired to help Trump get elected, which is what the manufactured January 2017 intelligence community assessment says with high confidence, according to Brennan and Clapper, then Putin would have released the most damaging information and emails to help President Trump,” she said, questioning why the alleged Russian intelligence was never made public if Moscow truly had a goal to uplift Trump’s campaign.“It was intentionally withheld and not released because they assumed that Hillary Clinton would win that election, and their plan,” Gabbard said, reports the New York Post.Much of the material released by Gabbard focuses on challenging the findings of a 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA), which asserted, among other conclusions, that “the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.”Gabbard accused former President Obama of ordering the 2017 ICA of Russian interference in the 2016 election, highlighting the actions of his administration, outlined in the newly released documents.“Out of respect for the office of the presidency, our office does not normally dignify the constant nonsense and misinformation flowing out of this White House with a response. But these claims are outrageous enough to merit one,” a spokesperson for Obama said, slamming the revelations made by Gabbard.“These bizarre allegations are ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction. Nothing in the document issued last week undercuts the widely accepted conclusion that Russia worked to influence the 2016 presidential election but did not successfully manipulate any votes,"" said the Spokesperson.","Director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has claimed that Russian officials privately anticipated a Hillary Clinton victory was “inevitable” in the 2016 US presidential election. “It surprised me that all of these documents still existed, quite frankly,” she said on an episode that is scheduled to release on Wednesday.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123084128,imgsize-958982,width-400,resizemode-4/123084128.jpg"

""In the current unimaginable condition, they may have only days left to live.""""The prime minister expressed profound shock over the materials distributed by the terror organisations Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and told the families that the efforts to return all our hostages are ongoing, and will continue constantly and relentlessly,"" Netanyahu’s office stated late Saturday.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday called on the International Committee of the Red Cross to assist with the hostages held in Gaza, reports AFP.Hamas’s armed wing responded by agreeing to grant the agency access to the hostages, but only on the condition that ""humanitarian corridors"" for food and aid are opened “across all areas of the Gaza Strip.""For months, humanitarian groups and international agencies have warned that Gaza is experiencing ""critical"" hunger levels, with famine ""imminent"" in some areas of the Gaza Strip.Gaza’s health ministry has also reported an increasing number of deaths linked to malnutrition. Around 175 people, including 93 children, have died due to malnutrition, as per the ministry, reports ABC News.Israel has imposed strict limits on the flow of aid into the besieged Gaza Strip, while UN agencies, humanitarian organizations, and analysts report that much of the aid permitted is either looted or diverted amid chaotic conditions.Many Palestinians are forced to risk their lives to access whatever limited aid is distributed through controlled channels.","Netanyahu has proposed expanding military operations in Gaza, aiming to use force to rescue approximately 20 hostages still believed to be alive since their capture during Hamas’s attack on October 7, 2023.

Ex-DOGE employee ‘big balls’ assaulted in Washington DC: Why was he attacked; who was behind it?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ex-doge-employee-edward-coristine-big-balls-assaulted-in-washington-dc-why-was-he-attacked-who-was-behind-it/articleshow/123130808.cms,"Attack on 'Big Balls': What happened



Trump threatens federal takeover of DC



City Officials Respond as juvenile crime surges







A former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employee known online as “Big Balls” was violently attacked during an attempted carjacking in Washington DC early Sunday morning. Edward Coristine, the victim, was reportedly trying to protect a woman near their parked vehicle in the city’s Logan Circle neighbourhood when a group of teenagers approached and assaulted him.The incident occurred around 3 a.m. on Swann Street NW, according to the Metropolitan Police Department. Authorities said the suspects attempted to steal the vehicle and began beating Coristine when he intervened. Two 15-year-olds from Hyattsville, Maryland, a boy and a girl, were arrested on the scene and charged with unarmed carjacking. Several other suspects fled and remain at large.According to a police statement, the group approached Coristine and the woman near their vehicle and made a threat about taking the car. Coristine pushed the woman into the vehicle for her safety before confronting the group. Multiple attackers then allegedly beat him severely until nearby officers intervened, causing the group to flee. Coristine sustained injuries requiring treatment at the scene.Former DOGE chief Elon Musk chimed in claiming that a ""gang"" of about a dozen young men tried to assault a women causing Coristine to ""run in and defend her"". After which he was beaten ""to the point of concussion.""Images shared on social media by President Trump showed Coristine bloodied and sitting on the pavement following the assault.The New York Post further cited the police report identifying Coristine as the victim and detailing how he was struck after trying to fend off the attackers. The incident remains under investigation, with DC’s Carjacking Task Force and the FBI Washington Field Office involved.The attack has fuelled President Trump’s push to take federal control of the city. “Crime in Washington, D.C., is totally out of control,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, calling for minors as young as 14 to be tried as adults. “If D.C. doesn’t get its act together... we will have no choice but to take Federal control of the City.”In remarks to reporters on Tuesday, Trump reiterated, “Either they’re going to straighten their act out... or we’re going to have to federalize and run it the way it’s supposed to be run.”The president has repeatedly claimed that DC’s current government is failing to curb youth violence and protect its citizens. He previously suggested federalising DC during a cabinet meeting in July, a move that would require congressional approval to repeal the 1973 Home Rule Act.District Attorney Brian Schwalb called the attack “horrific and disturbing,” adding that his office would prosecute juveniles when there is sufficient evidence. Jeanine Pirro, the US Attorney for DC, echoed Trump’s frustration, stating, “It’s time we start taking crime more seriously irrespective of the age of the criminal.”While violent crime in the district has declined overall, youth-led offences — particularly carjackings — remain a persistent issue. According to Fox5 DC, Coristine’s case follows a disturbing pattern: several recent carjackings in the capital have involved teenagers, including cases where children as young as 14 were implicated in fatal attacks.Locals continue to report feeling unsafe amid what many see as a breakdown in law enforcement’s ability to deter violent youth offenders. As NYPost highlighted, Washington’s juvenile arrest rate nearly doubles the national average, with more than 2,200 youth arrests annually between 2016 and 2022.The police have urged anyone with further information to contact the MPD tip line and are offering up to $10,000 for tips leading to further arrests in this case.","Edward Coristine, a former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employee known online as ‘Big Balls’ was violently attacked during an attempted carjacking in Washington DC early Sunday morning.

'Totally out of control': Trump calls for prosecuting minors amid Washington crime concerns; threatens to take federal control,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/totally-out-of-control-trump-calls-for-prosecuting-minors-amid-washington-crime-concerns-threatens-to-take-federal-control/articleshow/123127632.cms,"US President Donald Trump (Image credits AP)





US President Donald Trump on Tuesday threatened to place Washington, DC, under federal control, claiming the city’s crime is “totally out of control” and urging that minors as young as 14 be prosecuted as adults. His comments came the same day the FBI released new data showing a nationwide drop in violent crime.In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote, “Crime in Washington, DC, is totally out of control. Local ‘youths’ and gang members, some only 14, 15, and 16-years-old, are randomly attacking, mugging, maiming, and shooting innocent citizens, at the same time knowing that they will be almost immediately released.”While sharing a photo of a critically injured youth from a recent violent incident involving local teenagers, Trump claimed the victim had been “beaten mercilessly by local thugs,” though he did not provide specific details about the case.“The Law in DC must be changed to prosecute these ‘minors’ as adults, and lock them up for a long time, starting at age 14,” he added.Trump also suggested that if city leaders fail to act, he would move to federalise the capital. “They are not afraid of Law Enforcement because they know nothing ever happens to them, but it’s going to happen now! If DC doesn’t get its act together, and quickly, we will have no choice but to take Federal control of the City, and run this City how it should be run,” he said.Trump’s remarks directly contradict the FBI’s annual crime report, released earlier Tuesday. According to the report, cited by NBC News, violent crime in the US fell by 4.5% in 2024, with significant declines in murder, robbery, rape, and aggravated assault. Property crime and hate crime rates also saw drops compared to 2023.The report draws from data submitted by over 16,000 law enforcement agencies, covering 95% of the US population. FBI Assistant Director Timothy Ferguson noted during a media briefing that although crime is down overall, violent and property crimes still occur regularly.Trump has frequently made crime a central theme in his political messaging, often portraying American cities as lawless. At a campaign event near Detroit last year, he said, “You can’t walk across the street to get a loaf of bread. You get shot, you get mugged, you get raped,” according to NBC News.While crime remains a contentious political issue, particularly in major urban areas like Washington, DC, recent federal data indicates that overall trends are moving in the opposite direction of Trump’s claims.","US President Donald Trump threatened to place Washington, DC, under federal control.

'These people do it naturally': Trump says undocumented workers are born to toil in fields; floats legal reentry plan for deported migrants,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/these-people-do-it-naturally-trump-says-undocumented-workers-are-born-to-toil-in-fields-floats-legal-reentry-plan-for-deported-migrants/articleshow/123127544.cms,"US President Donald Trump (Image credits: AP)





US President Donald Trump on Tuesday, while speaking about the impact of his administration’s immigration policies on the agricultural sector, claimed undocumented migrants are more “naturally” inclined to perform hard labor — a statement that many have condemned as racist and dehumanising.During an interview with CNBC, addressing the impact of his immigration policies on American agriculture, Trump acknowledged the difficulty farmers are facing in finding labor amid ongoing deportation efforts. “We can’t let our farmers not have anybody,” he said.He suggested that, while deportations would continue, some undocumented farm workers might be allowed to return legally under a “touchback” plan. “In some cases, we’re sending [migrants] back to their country with a pass back in legally.”“These [are] people that you can’t replace them very easily — you know, people that live in the inner city are not doing that work. They’re just not doing that work. And they’ve tried — we’ve tried, everybody tried. They don’t do it. These people do it naturally, naturally,” he added.Trump also recalled a recent conversation with a farmer about the physical demands of the job. “I said, ‘What happens if they get it — to a farmer the other day — what happens if they get a bad back?’ He said, ‘They don’t get a bad back, sir, because if they get a bad back, they die.’… You know, in many ways they’re very, very special people.”The remarks come as the White House continues to wrestle with how to address the agricultural sector’s reliance on undocumented workers without angering immigration hardliners.Officials are reportedly exploring ways to expand the H-2A visa program to year-round agricultural industries like dairy. But that change would fall short of covering the estimated 320,000 undocumented farm workers already in the US, reported Politico.Proposals like the touchback program are also drawing criticism from immigration hawks who oppose any form of legal return or special carveouts for specific industries, viewing them as a slippery slope toward amnesty","US President Donald Trump on Tuesday claimed undocumented migrants are more ‘naturally’ inclined to perform hard labor.

A University of California San Diego associate professor is under investigation after being confronted on video in an alleged online child predator sting. The video, widely circulated on social media, shows Nisarg Shah being accused of attempting to meet someone he believed to be a 14-year-old boy for sex.Shah, who teaches in the Aiiso Yufeng Li family department of chemical and nano engineering at UCSD’s Jacobs School of Engineering, was confronted on Saturday, inside a Pavilions grocery store in San Diego’s Hillcrest neighborhood.The sting was coordinated by online activists using Instagram handles @timjohnson.458 and @vans_against_predators, with the video watermarked by the group ""People v Preds,” reported San Diego Ville.Activist Tim Johnson, who claims to have exposed more than 500 suspected predators, confronted Shah over sexually explicit messages allegedly exchanged on the dating app Grindr. Screenshots shared by the group show Shah identifying himself as 28 years old and continuing to chat after the decoy disclosed they were “bout to be 15.”During the encounter, Shah repeatedly expressed remorse. “I feel horrible, the worst I’ve ever felt,” he says.He describes his conduct as “abhorrent” and admits to bringing personal lubricant and a douche, claiming it was to help the person “get ready” and “prep.” He adds, ""I need to maybe get help or something.”Two San Diego police department patrol cars arrived during the confrontation. An officer is seen in the video informing the activists that Shah would not be arrested at the time, stating he was “not allowed to arrest him” under the circumstances.Shah’s phone was seized, and evidence from the sting was turned over to the Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) task force. Although a photo shows Shah in handcuffs, he was reportedly released at the scene.When contacted by San Diego Ville, Shah responded through his attorney, “These are wrongful allegations and while I would have been willing to share my account, my attorney will not let me do so but he would be happy to speak with you.”In response to inquiries, SDPD Lt Travis Easter issued a statement, saying, “We are aware of the incident and our ICAC unit is actively investigating it. There have not been any charges made as of yet.UC San Diego also released a statement, “We have been made aware of the allegations against Nisarg J Shah. We will cooperate with all law enforcement agencies as needed during any investigation. The health, well-being and safety of our campus community members is our top priority. All allegations of sexual harassment and sexual violence are taken very seriously.”Shah is a specialist in immunoengineering and nanoscale materials. He earned his PhD from MIT and completed a postdoctoral fellowship at Harvard University before joining UC San Diego, where he currently leads a research lab and teaches.The incident has sparked widespread backlash online, with many calling on the university to investigate and take disciplinary action.","Nisarg Shah, an associate professor at UC San Diego, is accused of trying to meet someone he believed to be a 14-year-old boy for sex.

'Antisemitism': Fema no longer requires states to oppose Israel boycotts; DHS confirms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/antisemitism-fema-no-longer-requires-states-to-oppose-israel-boycotts-dhs-confirms/articleshow/123125909.cms,"DHS representative image





The Trump administration has quietly removed a clause from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) guidelines that required states to maintain commercial ties with Israel in order to qualify for federal emergency funds.The clause, previously listed in the department of homeland security’s (DHS) internal terms and conditions, stated that states “must not support severing commercial relations, or otherwise limiting commercial relations specifically with Israeli companies or with companies doing business in or with Israel.”The condition was removed without public announcement on Monday.The reversal comes after mounting backlash and media scrutiny over the administration’s threat to withhold at least $1.9 billion in disaster relief from states and cities that support boycotts of Israel or Israeli firms. Fema funding is essential for states to manage natural disasters, support emergency operations, pay staff, and maintain critical equipment.DHS oversees Fema operations, and on Monday, agency spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin confirmed the policy shift, saying, “Fema grants remain governed by existing law and policy and not political litmus tests,” as quoted by Euro News.The clause appeared to target the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which seeks to apply economic pressure on Israel over its military actions in Gaza, now ongoing for more than 20 months.The DHS had previously referred to the BDS campaign as a “discriminatory prohibited boycott,” language that has now been removed from Fema’s updated guidelines, reported Euro News.“There is NO Fema requirement tied to Israel in any current NOFO. No states have lost funding, and no new conditions have been imposed,” DHS said in a post on X Tuesday.“DHS will enforce all anti-discrimination laws and policies, including as it relates to the BDS movement, which is expressly grounded in antisemitism. Those who engage in racial discrimination should not receive a single dollar of federal funding,” it added.The administration’s initial inclusion of the clause was widely criticised for tying life-saving emergency assistance to political ideology. Multiple US media outlets condemned the move as using federal aid to enforce political loyalty.The decision to backtrack also comes amid growing international criticism of Israel’s ongoing military offensive in Gaza. While the Trump administration has maintained strong pro-Israel policies, it has also pledged to combat what it calls “left-wing induced antisemitism,” asserting that it has no place in the US and “will not be tolerated.","The Trump administration has quietly removed a clause from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) guidelines that required states to maintain commercial ties with Israel.

US President Donald Trump surprised reporters on Tuesday morning when he was seen walking along the roof of the White House, directly above the press briefing room, joking that he was “just taking a little walk” — before laughingly adding that he was scouting a spot to install “nuclear missiles. ”The president, known for his interest in real estate and renovations, was accompanied by a small group, including James McCrery, the architect behind the newly announced $200 million privately funded East Wing ballroom project, reported WCNC News. The group moved slowly as Trump frequently gestured and pointed at the rooftop and the grounds below.Trump, gesturing as if envisioning a circular structure, was asked what he planned to build. He quipped, “nuclear missiles,” chuckled, and mimicked a projectile with his hand.At one point, he shouted toward reporters, “Anything I do is financed by me!” He also remarked that he was exploring “another way to spend my money for this country.”While the president was walking on the west side of the White House, above the press briefing room and not the East Wing, he appeared to be inspecting ongoing or potential construction projects.He did not respond to questions about whether he plans to add another floor to the West Wing to accommodate staff or press.Trump has completed several renovation projects during his term and has proposed more. The $200 million ballroom is among his highest-profile plans, which he hopes to finish before leaving office.He may also have been checking out the recently renovated Rose Garden, located directly below the West Wing roof. The redesign included a concrete floor, aimed at making it easier for women in heels to walk without sinking into the ground, according to WCNC News.Throughout his presidency, Trump has regularly toured the White House grounds to speak with construction crews and observe projects firsthand. Past additions include two 100-foot flagpoles, one on the North Lawn and one on the South Lawn, each flying large American flags. He also redecorated the Oval Office with gold plating on the ceiling, fireplace, and floor.","US President Donald Trump was seen walking along the roof of the White House, directly above the press briefing room.

The US House oversight committee has issued subpoenas to former President Bill Clinton, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, and several former senior justice department and FBI officials as part of its investigation into the crimes committed by convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.On Tuesday, committee chairman James Comer, R-Ky, announced the subpoenas, which demand testimony from a wide range of former officials. Those targeted include former attorneys general Loretta Lynch, Eric Holder, Bill Barr, Merrick Garland, Jeff Sessions, and Alberto Gonzales, as well as former FBI directors James Comey and Robert Mueller.The committee is seeking answers regarding what Comer described as “horrific crimes perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein.” as quoted by NBC News. Comer has also subpoenaed the Department of Justice, demanding it hand over the “full, complete, unredacted Epstein Files” by August 19, 2025.The move follows mounting criticism of the DOJ’s handling of the Epstein case. Last month, the department said it would not bring charges against additional individuals and would not release further details. That decision has sparked bipartisan frustration and renewed calls for transparency.Among the most notable subpoenas is one directed at former President Bill Clinton, asking him to sit for a deposition on October 14. In his letter, Comer cited Clinton’s past ties to Epstein.“By your own admission, you flew on Jeffrey Epstein’s private plane four separate times in 2002 and 2003,” Comer wrote.“You were also allegedly close to Ms Ghislane Maxwell, an Epstein co-conspirator, and attended an intimate dinner with her in 2014, three years after public reports about her involvement in Mr. Epstein’s abuse of minors,” he added, referring to Ghislaine Maxwell, whose name was misspelled in the letter, reported NBC News.Comer also pointed to “conflicting reports about whether you ever visited Mr Epstein’s island.” While Clinton has consistently denied visiting Epstein’s private island, the location where some of the abuse allegedly took place, President Donald Trump has publicly claimed Clinton traveled there “28 times,” though he has provided no evidence.Representatives for the Clintons have not responded to the latest subpoenas. However, Clinton’s spokesperson Angel Urena issued a statement in 2019, saying the former president “knows nothing about the terrible crimes” Epstein had been charged with. Urena confirmed that Clinton had traveled on Epstein’s private jet four times in 2002 and 2003 as part of Clinton Foundation work, and was accompanied on each trip by staff and Secret Service agents.“He has not spoken to Epstein in well over a decade,” Urena said at the time.","The US House oversight committee has issued subpoenas to former President Bill Clinton, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, and several former senior justice department and FBI officials.

Pakistan political standoff deepens as PTI marks Imran’s two years in jail,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-political-standoff-deepens-as-pti-marks-imrans-two-years-in-jail/articleshow/123125854.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: Two years after former prime minister Imran Khan was jailed, Pakistan is caught in a dangerous political deadlock. Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) marked the anniversary with nationwide protests on Tuesday, confronting an increasingly dominant military establishment led by Field Marshal Asim Munir.Demonstrators took to the streets in Lahore, Karachi, Peshawar, and other cities, demanding Khan’s release from Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail, where he has been held since Aug 2023 on charges ranging from corruption to incitement. PTI called the protests a “do-or-die” moment for democracy. In response, police in Punjab and other regions launched a crackdown, detaining dozens of workers and raiding party politicians’ homes, a move Punjab police denied, though sources confirmed at least 20 arrests in Lahore.The crackdown follows sweeping convictions last week, when an anti-terrorism court in Faisalabad sentenced 108 PTI members, including opposition politicians Omar Ayub, Shibli Faraz, and Zartaj Gul Wazir, to 10 years in jail over the May 9, 2023 riots in which military installations were attacked following Khan’s brief arrest. Additional convictions were also handed down by another Punjab court, signalling what critics say is a coordinated effort to decapitate the party.PTI chairman Gohar Ali Khan denounced the rulings as “engineered”, timed to sabotage the protests. “These are not trials, they’re political purges,” he said.Khan, speaking through his X account, has accused the military of rigging the 2024 elections and enforcing what he called “Asim Law” — de facto military rule propped up by Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). The bitter personal feud between Khan and Munir dates back to 2019, when Khan, then PM, removed Munir as ISI chief, a humiliation the now army chief has apparently not forgotten.Since Munir’s appointment in 2022, the military has tightened its grip on civilian institutions. In June, Munir was controversially promoted to field marshal, Pakistan’s first since Ayub Khan, drawing criticism as a face-saving move after recent strategic and political setbacks. The military’s power has been further entrenched by a May 2025 Supreme Court ruling allowing civilian trials in military courts, and the passage of the 26th Amendment, which PTI says undermines judicial independence.The PTI’s cause has found support overseas, where diaspora communities have launched sustained protest campaigns in cities like London, Toronto, and Houston. Demonstrators have condemned what they call “military rule in civilian clothing”, using social media and digital billboards to amplify their message. While their efforts have gained some attention from rights groups and sympathetic lawmakers, they have yet to translate into meaningful international pressure on Islamabad.Back home, the govt defends the crackdown as a lawful response to what it sees as attempts to destabilise the state. But human rights groups, including Amnesty International, accuse authorities of using “unlawful and excessive force”, including arbitrary arrests, internet shutdowns, and blanket bans on public gatherings.Pakistan’s escalating political crisis is no longer just about Imran Khan. It is a contest for power, legitimacy, and the future of democratic space in the country.","Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) marked the anniversary with nationwide protests on Tuesday.

ISLAMABAD:

‘Trump Angry As India Denies Nobel Push, Rejects' Mediation In Operation Sindoor Ceasefire | WATCH





In a symbolic assertion of strategic alignment, Pakistan’s military hosted on Friday a grand ceremony at General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi to mark the 98th anniversary of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA), showcasing its deepening defence partnership with Beijing.The event came soon after a surprise 19% tariff on Pakistani imports announced by US President Donald Trump just days after Washington and Islamabad concluded new trade deals.While the tariff decision is believed to have been discussed between the two sides as part of broader trade negotiations, Trump’s typically blunt commentary on social media appeared aimed more at India than Pakistan. In recent days, Trump has taken jabs at New Delhi over its continued purchase of Russian oil and defence equipment, while casting Pakistan in a more favourable light.At GHQ, however, Pakistan’s military made its strategic loyalties unambiguous. Army Chief Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir hosted Chinese ambassador Jiang Zaidong and PLA defence attaché Maj Gen Wang Zhong at a ceremony that included military tributes, visuals of joint defence hardware, and strong political messaging. Munir described the Pakistan-China relationship as a “beacon of mutual trust and shared destiny” and referred to the PLA and Pakistan Army as “iron brothers”.The messaging was clear: Pakistan is reaffirming its long-standing alignment with China even as it navigates transactional ties with Washington and economic turbulence at home. With IMF conditionalities tightening and Western funding streams growing unpredictable, Islamabad continues to anchor itself in Beijing’s strategic orbit, particularly through projects under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).For China, the event was a diplomatic win. As Beijing faces intensifying rivalry with the US across the Indo-Pacific, its deepening influence over a nuclear-armed ally in South Asia reinforces its foothold in the region. The GHQ ceremony was a visual and political endorsement of China’s role as Islamabad’s primary defence and development partner.With Pakistan and China enhancing defence cooperation and projecting unity, New Delhi faces a more tightly aligned northern bloc just as it expands its own security ties with the US and with Indo-Pacific allies.Despite the potential economic fallout of the US tariffs, Rawalpindi appears undeterred. In an era of fluid alliances, Pakistan is betting on consistency with Beijing over the unpredictability of Western partners, a gamble that could reshape the regional balance in the years ahead.",Pakistan's military hosted a grand ceremony to mark the 98th anniversary of China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) The event came soon after a surprise 19% tariff on Pakistani imports announced by US President Donald Trump.

Pakistan jails more than 100 members of ex-PM Imran Khan's party for 2023 riots,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-jails-more-than-100-members-of-ex-pm-imran-khans-party-for-2023-riots/articleshow/123031704.cms,"Imran Khan (AP file photo)





A Pakistani anti-terrorism court on Thursday sentenced more than 100 members of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan 's party to prison terms on charges related to riots that targeted military sites in 2023, a court order said.Fifty-eight of the defendants, who included parliamentarians and senior officials, were sentenced to 10 years in prison and the rest were given sentences ranging from one to three years, the court said.The accused include Omar Ayub Khan and Shibli Faraz, the leaders of Khan's opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party (PTI) in the lower and upper houses of parliament respectively, the court order seen by Reuters read.""The prosecution has proved its case against the accused without a shadow of doubt,"" it said in announcing the sentences.Khan, who has been in prison since 2023 facing charges of corruption, land fraud and disclosure of official secrets, is being tried separately on similar charges related to the riot.The government accuses him and other leaders of inciting the May 9, 2023, protests, during which demonstrators attacked military and government buildings, including the army headquarters in Rawalpindi.He denies wrongdoing and says all the cases are politically motivated as part of a military-backed crackdown to dismantle his party. The military denies it.Khan's arrest had prompted the countrywide violent protests.Thursday's ruling does not directly affect the incitement case against him in which prosecution is still presenting witnesses.The PTI party said it will challenge the verdict.The ruling is the third such mass conviction this month; Khan's party says they have included at least 14 of its parliamentarians.They will lose their seats in parliament under Pakistani laws, which will shred Khan's opposition party's strength.Another 77 were acquitted for lack of evidence in the latest verdict, which is linked to an attack on the office of an intelligence agency in eastern city of Faisalabad, the court said.The party plans new protests starting on August 5, the second anniversary of Khan's jailing, to demand his release.","Fifty-eight of the defendants, who included parliamentarians and senior officials, were sentenced to 10 years in prison.

"Glacial bursts, cloudbursts kill 293 in Pakistan; another monsoon spell looms",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/glacial-bursts-cloudbursts-kill-293-in-pakistan-another-monsoon-spell-looms/articleshow/122983132.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: At least 293 people have died and over 600 have been injured across Pakistan since late June as glacial lake outbursts, cloudbursts, and relentless monsoon rains triggered catastrophic floods across the country, from the Himalayas to the southern plains.The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has warned of another severe monsoon spell starting July 29, raising fears of fresh flash floods and landslides, especially in northern regions like Swat, Chitral, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Torrential rains have wreaked havoc across the country, sweeping away entire families, burying homes under landslides, and cutting off remote valleys. A sudden cloudburst near Babusar Top and Naran stranded scores of tourists, prompting military-led rescue operations by air and road. Washed-away bridges and blocked highways have hampered relief efforts.The NDMA, provincial agencies, and army teams are on the ground, but operations remain slow and patchy, especially in the hard-to-reach northern areas. Helicopter sorties continue, though poor weather and visibility are disrupting missions.Experts blame successive govts for ignoring climate adaptation and disaster preparedness, despite warnings. “The pattern is repeating itself — glacial melts, erratic monsoons, unprepared institutions. It’s a deadly mix,” said a disaster risk analyst in Islamabad.The crisis echoes the devastating 2022 monsoon floods, which killed over 1,700, submerged a third of the country, and displaced over 30 million people, causing $30 billion in economic losses. Yet, activists say climate resilience remains absent from Pakistan’s national priorities.With more glaciers than any non-polar country, Pakistan faces an increasing frequency of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) due to rising temperatures. Add to that deforestation, poor drainage, and unregulated construction, and experts say even routine monsoons now turn deadly.As another deluge looms, govt has advised evacuations from high-risk zones and warned tourists to stay away from northern areas. But for many already stranded, the warnings have come too late.","At least 293 people have died and over 600 have been injured across Pakistan since late June.
