Accenture techie murdered in Bengaluru: Student plotted killing after she resisted his advances; flat set ablaze to mask crime,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/neighbour-student-held-for-murder-of-techie-in-bengaluru-flat-torched-to-destroy-evidence/articleshow/126469068.cms,"





BENGALURU: What was first believed to be a tragic death in a house fire has now been uncovered as a brutal murder.A second-year pre-university student has been arrested for the killing of a 34-year-old software engineer in east Bengaluru earlier this month. Police said the accused allegedly smothered the woman after she resisted his advances and then set fire to her flat in a calculated attempt to erase evidence.The victim, Sharmila Kushalappa, a native of Mangaluru, worked with Accenture and lived alone in a rented flat in Subramanya Layout, Ramamurthynagar. On the night of Jan 3, she was found unconscious inside her locked two-bedroom apartment after a fire broke out. She was later declared dead, with initial suspicion pointing to smoke inhalation — a theory that investigators would soon prove wrong.The accused, Karnal Kurai K, a IInd-year PU student at a private college and from Arasunagar in Virajpet town of Kodagu district, lived with his mother in the same building, next door to Sharmila's flat on the second floor. He has been arrested and remanded to three days of police custody.According to police, the case took a decisive turn after forensic and postmortem findings contradicted the initial assumption that Sharmila had died due to smoke inhalation. Ramamurthynagar police had received a complaint from Sharmila's friend, K Rohit, who suspected foul play after learning of her death.On the night of the incident, at 10.30pm, the building owner alerted the fire department after noticing smoke coming from Sharmila's flat. Fire personnel broke open the locked door and doused the flames. Sharmila was found lying motionless near the kitchen and was rushed to hospital, where doctors declared her brought dead.Investigators said injuries on her hands and visible signs of a struggle at the scene raised doubts. During autopsy, doctors found that the injuries were inflicted prior to the fire and were inconsistent with accidental burns. Medical opinion indicated that Sharmila had been smothered just before she lost consciousness.Based on this, police narrowed their probe and detained Karnal for questioning. He reportedly confessed to the crime. A police officer said Karnal entered Sharmila's flat through a sliding window at 9pm. When confronted, he expressed his desire towards her, which she resisted, shouting at him to leave. Enraged by the rejection, he allegedly held her mouth and nose shut, causing her to lose consciousness.Police said bloodstains from her mouth and nose were found on her clothes. To destroy this evidence, the accused allegedly removed the clothes and set them on fire before escaping through the same window. The fire later spread to other parts of the flat.","Karnal Kurai K, a second-year pre-university student has been arrested for the killing of a 34-year-old software engineer in east Bengaluru.

Son: Proloy Chaki arrested in Bangladesh without any case

DHAKA: Renowned Hindu musician and senior Awami League functionary Proloy Chaki has died in police custody in Bangladesh, with his family members accusing the prison administration of denying necessary medical care to the 60-year-old and rubbishing police's claim that it was a ""natural death"", reports Ahsan Tasnim.Proloy - held in a blast case linked to the 2024 anti-discrimination student movement that grew into the 'July Uprising' and led to Sheikh Hasina's ouster as PM - died on Sunday night. The cultural affairs secretary of the party's Pabna unit, Proloy was picked up by police from his house in Pabna's Dilalpur on Dec 16 and later shown as arrested.Proloy Chaki’s death comes at a time when Bangladesh is in the grip of relentless violence against minorities, particularly Hindus, and groups, parties and institutions aligned with Awami League. Seven Hindus have died and properties of minorities targeted by arsonists since the lynching of Dipu Chandra Das in Mymensingh on Dec 18. Pabna jail superintendent Md Omar Faruk said Proloy had been suffering from multiple health complications, including diabetes and heart disease.“He suffered a cardiac arrest and was first taken to Pabna General Hospital on Friday. Later, as his condition deteriorated, he was shifted to Rajshahi Medical College Hospital, where he died around 9 pm on Sunday,” Omar said, adding that “it is a natural death”.Proloy’s son Sony Chaki said, “My father was arrested despite not being named in any case at the time. He had been suffering from diabetes and heart disease for a long time. His condition worsened in jail, but authorities did not officially inform us.” “We rushed to the hospital after being informed by others, but he did not get proper treatment, which led to his death,” he said.Jail superintendent Omar has rejected the charges. Besides political identity, Pabna Sammilito Shangskritik Jote secretary Bhaskar Chowdhury said, “Proloy was a renowned singer and music director. He had also served as secretary of Shree Shree Ram Krishna Shebashrom.” Proloy was a prominent cultural activist of the 1990s, he said.",Proloy Chaki was cultural affairs secretary of the party's Pabna unit.

Nabin ascension is seen as a move towards overhaul of BJP

NEW DELHI: BJP working president Nitin Nabin is set to take over as full-fledged national president of the party on Jan 20, in the presence of PM Modi and other senior leaders, including chief ministers, national office-bearers, state party presidents and national executive council members, reports Akhilesh Singh. He will replace JP Nadda , one of the longest-serving party presidents.Since his appointment as working president, Nabin has enjoyed the support of the party brass. His ascension, following elections on Jan 20, therefore, is being seen as a formality.With full-throttle endorsement from the saffron fountainhead, RSS, Nitin Nabin (46) will be the youngest party president, and his ascension is seen as a move towards a complete overhaul of the party, with a possible mix of youth and experience. Party sources have indicated that nominations for the president’s election will take place on Jan 19, followed by election the next day.Party sources said that after completing the nomination process, Nabin will be elected national president the next day. He had been appointed BJP working president on Dec 15, but his formal takeover was on hold due to “kharmas”, an inauspicious phase when Hindus avoid taking up new work or marking a beginning.Since his appointment, Nabin has been meeting party workers at the BJP headquarters.Widely regarded as an organisational chief, Nabin currently represents Bankipur assembly constituency in Patna district. Nabin is the son of the late BJP politician and former BJP MLA Nabin Kishore Prasad Sinha. With nearly two decades of organisational experience, Nabin has held several key roles within the party, including as Bihar president of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha and BJP’s election in-charge for Chhattisgarh.","Nitin Nabin set to take over as full-fledged national president of the party on Jan 20.

People say they were not ‘witnesses’, cops say probe will reveal all

BHOPAL: From late-night raids to routine seizures spread across villages miles apart, they were present everywhere - many a time simultaneously at different locations. Allegations of 'omnipresent' police witnesses in Madhya Pradesh's Mauganj district have snowballed into a major controversy after scrutiny of digital crime tracking records confirmed that the same six individuals were repeatedly cited as govt witnesses in hundreds of cases registered at Laur and Naigadhi police stations in the district.The pattern of a few selected names recurring case after case emerged from FIRs accessed through Crime & Criminal Tracking Network & Systems, a home ministry project.At the centre of the allegations is Jagdish Singh Thakur, former in-charge of Naigadhi and Laur police stations, against whom complaints were lodged by an RTI activist, accusing him of misusing his position to register over 150 questionable FIRs. The complaint alleged that under his charge at the two police stations, the same favoured individuals were repeatedly cited witnesses to facilitate routine police action, justify the cases on paper and enable corruption.One of the six individuals, Amit Kushwaha, who was cited as a witness in hundreds of cases, allegedly moved with Thakur during his transfers. The activist, Kunj Bihari Tiwari, first lodged a police complaint in 2022. He filed another detailed complaint in Dec 2025, sharing 'proof'.Acting on the complaint, Mauganj SP Dilip Soni removed Thakur as Naigadhi police station incharge Sunday. “We are getting the complaint probed in detail.The complainant shared details regarding 145 FIRs with common witnesses,” Soni told TOI. He however, added that “this was not the only reason, but one of the reasons for which the action was taken”. Some of the ‘witnesses’ have now distanced themselves from the police’s move.Dinesh Kushwaha, a vegetable vendor, told TOI: “I signed as a witness in only one or two cases where I was present. I wasn’t a witness in so many other cases. Police wrote my name as a witness without my knowledge.” Another witness, Rahul Vishwakarma, said: “I was not present during the action. Iused to sign after the accused were arrested and brought to the police station. But I did not sign as a witness in so many cases. I am a driver. ” Tiwari claimed the rot runs much deeper.“I examined FIRs of more than a year and found around 200 cases with common names. When I scanned the records from the year 2000, I found similar names in about 1,000 FIRs. I am also a victim, as I was framed in a case by the same police officer,” the complainant alleged. TOIaccessed and examined copies of over 40 such FIRs and found the same names repeatedly listed as witnesses across unrelated cases. Police officers said the probe will determine whether legal procedures and norms were violated and whether disciplinary or criminal action was required.",Allegations of 'omnipresent' police witnesses in Madhya Pradesh's Mauganj district have snowballed into a major controversy. scrutiny of digital crime tracking records confirmed that the same six individuals were repeatedly cited as govt witnesses in hundreds of cases registered at Laur and Naigadhi police stations.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126492210,imgsize-571525,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-20.jpg"
"'Will come to Mumbai, try cutting my legs': BJP’s Annamalai fires back at Raj Thackeray; slams ‘rasmalai’ jibe",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-come-to-mumbai-try-cutting-my-legs-bjps-annamalai-fires-back-at-raj-thackeray-slams-rasmalai-jibe/articleshow/126479823.cms,"'Will Come to Mumbai, Try Cutting My Legs: Annamalai Hits Back at Raj Thackeray

NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP )leader K Annamalai on Monday launched a broadside against Raj Thackeray and dared the MNS chief to stop him from entering Mumbai.The reaction came a day after Thackeray mockingly referred to the BJP leader as “rasmalai” and questioned his standing to speak on issues related to Mumbai.At a press conference in Chennai, the BJP leader alleged that he has received multiple threats, with some people even threatening to cut off his legs.“Who are Aaditya Thackeray and Raj Thackeray to threaten me? I am proud to be a farmer’s son. They have organised meetings just to abuse me. I don’t know whether I have become that important,” Annamalai said.“Some have written that they will cut my legs if I come to Mumbai. I will come to Mumbai—try cutting my legs. If I were afraid of such threats, I would have stayed in my village. If I say Kamaraj is one of India’s greatest leaders, does it mean he is no longer a Tamil? If I say Mumbai is a world-class city, does it mean Maharashtrians didn’t build it? These people are just ignorant,” former Tamil Nadu BJP chief added.Earlier on Sunday, Thackeray attacked Annamalai for suggesting that Mumbai is an “international city”.Thackeray also referred to his uncle Bal Thackeray's slogan from the 1960s and 1970s — “Hatao lungi, bajao pungi.”“One rasmalai came from Tamil Nadu… what is your connection to here? Hatao lungi, bajao pungi,” Thackeray said at a joint UBT–MNS rally in Mumbai.Additionally, Thackeray also said that he would “kick” people from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh out of Maharashtra if they “try to impose Hindi”.“People from UP and Bihar should understand that Hindi is not your language. I don’t hate the language… but if you try to impose it, I’ll kick you. They’re coming from all sides to Maharashtra and snatching away your share. If land and language are gone, you will be finished,” Raj Thackeray was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray and his cousin Raj Thackeray also mounted a joint attack on the rival BJP over what they described as “fake Hindutva”, saying their political reunion was prompted by an imminent “danger” to Mumbai.Uddhav said he and Raj Thackeray had set aside their differences in the interest of the Marathi manoos, Hindus, and Maharashtra. Appealing to the core Marathi vote bank, Raj said the two leaders had come together as Mumbai was facing danger.Calling the BMC polls the “last election for the Marathi man”, Thackeray said: “If you miss this opportunity today, you will be finished. Unite for Marathi and Maharashtra.”The State Election Commission in Maharashtra has announced elections to 29 municipal corporations across the state, including the Pune Municipal Corporation, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, and the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation. Polling will be held on January 15, with counting scheduled for January 16.","K Annamalai says he has received multiple threats, with some people even threatening to cut off his legs.

NEW DELHI: Terming the actions of a Madhya Pradesh judicial officer who created a ruckus inside a train and allegedly urinated on the seat of a female co-passenger as disgusting and grossest misconduct, Supreme Court on Monday blocked the way for his reinstatement in the service. It stayed a MP HC order which had set aside his termination and directed his reinduction.Interestingly, it is MP HC administration which has approached SC challenging the order passed by its judicial side. Acting on the recommendation of the administrative committee and its full court reference, HC administration had terminated his job but he challenged it on the judicial side and a division bench set aside the termination order.""This is a shocking case. You urinated in the compartment. There was a lady... It is disgusting,"" a bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta said. It expressed surprise on how can HC pass the order in favour of a judicial officer after his disgusting behaviour in public.HC, in his petition filed by advocate Divyakant Lahoti, said that the judicial officer ""indulged in an extremely indecent conduct by urinating on the seat of a female co-passenger, exposing his private parts which is unbecoming of a judge"".It said that HC erred in reinstating him on the basis that he was acquitted in a criminal case lodged against him after the incident.""The reasoning adopted by HC, if allowed to stand, sets a damaging precedent whereby judicial officers proven guilty of misconduct in duly conducted departmental inquires may evade accountability by relying on technical criminal acquittals. Such an approach erodes the autonomy of disciplinary mechanisms, weakens institutional discipline, and risks undermining the very confidence that the public reposes in the judiciary. The preservation of judicial integrity demands that departmental findings, reached through a fair process and on the standard of preponderance of probabilities, be accorded their due weight, or the credibility of the institution itself would be in great peril,"" the petition said.The incident happened when the judge was travelling in an overnight express in June 2018 & was allegedly drunk. He had misbehaved and harassed co-passengers & indulged in obscene actions. He was arrested and was immediately released on bail. He was also acquitted in criminal case lodged against him after witnesses including TTE & victim passengers turned hostile.tnn",Madhya Pradesh judicial officer created a ruckus inside a train and allegedly urinated on the seat of a female co-passenger.

They not only started intimidating ED officers but also snatched the files and electronic evidence containing incriminating material from the officers.""""Officers of the petitioners were threatened and were not permitted to conduct any further search on the premises. The searches were conducted at two places - one at residence of Pratik Jain and second office premise of one company called Indian Pac Consulting Pvt Ltd,"" it said.It will be futile to approach local police to register an FIR for these illegal actions by the state's constitutional and police authorities as it involves the CM who also holds the home portfolio under whom the police function, ED said.It said Calcutta HC could not conduct hearing in its writ petition seeking registration of FIR and CBI probe into the illegal acts of the CM and others as her supporters created a ruckus and forced the judge to adjourn hearing. It sought a direction from SC to West Bengal Police not to lodge any FIR against ED officials without court's prior permission.""The fact that the supporters of CM are involved in creating ruckus is evidenced from the WhatsApp message in the WhatsApp group by party members to come and gather in huge numbers in the court. As a result of the tactics by the CM and her followers, remedy under Article 226 of the Constitution (in HC) has become illusory in the facts of the present case,"" ED said.ED said that the state police has maliciously registered several FIRs against its officers for conducting the raid and sought protection from the court to carry out unhindered its investigations into the PMLA case relating to illegal coal mining and I-PAC.","Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee, state DGP and Kolkata police commissioner accused of obstructing ED raid on I-PAC's Pratik Jain.

"Real friends can disagree but still resolve differences, says US envoy",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trade-deal-on-next-call-today-says-new-us-envoy-in-delhi/articleshow/126492239.cms,".

NEW DELHI: The US embassy belted out Hold On, I’m Coming, a 1960s classic President Donald Trump used in his election rallies, to welcome Ambassador Sergio Gor as he walked into his new office Monday, hitting all the right notes while declaring that his clear mission was to take the relationship to the next level.Gor backed the trade deal under discussion saying both sides are determined to achieve it, endorsed cooperation in counterterrorism, energy and technology, invited India to join the US-led Pax Silica initiative on supply chain security and asserted no partner is more essential than India.However, while he described Trump’s friendship with PM Narendra Modi as real, Gor said the president could visit India “hopefully in the next year or two”. The remark suggests that the already delayed Quad summit that India must host might have to wait longer.Gor addressed the embassy staff and media on his first day in office, even before officially presenting his credentials, indicating he won’t be dictated by conventions in performing his new role. The ambassador said that the US and India are bound not just by shared interests, but by a relationship anchored at the highest levels, and real friends can disagree but always resolve their differences in the end.“Last week, our great Secretary of State Marco Rubio powerfully stated that this year will be a year of reciprocity. We are raising the standard for diplomacy itself. That means fair trade, mutual respect, and shared security,” said Gor, adding both sides continue to actively engage for the trade and the next call on the issue would take place on Tuesday.""Remember, India is the world's largest nation, so it's not an easy task to get this across the finish line, but we are determined to get there. And while trade is very important for our relationship, we will continue to work closely together on other very important areas such as security, counterterrorism, energy, technology, education, and health,” he added while delivering his arrival speech. Despite the differences, both sides have been close to finalising the deal for a while now and India said last week it remained interested in a mutually beneficial trade deal between two complementary economies and looked forward to concluding it.On Pax Silica, a US flagship initiative on AI and reliable supply chain, Gor said that as the world adopts new technology, it is essential that India and the United States work together from the very start of this initiative. Only close US partners like the UK, Japan, South Korea and Israel were invited so far to join the effort that is meant to also challenge China’s dominance in high-end technology.Addressing the embassy staff, Gor said they had an opportunity to redefine diplomacy and accomplish what could be the most consequential global partnership of this century. “No partner is more essential than India. In the months and years ahead, it is my goal as ambassador to pursue a very ambitious agenda. We will do this as true strategic partners, each bringing strength, respect, and leadership to the table,” said Gor, who was welcomed with a musical extravaganza that played MAGA and Trump favourites like YMCA by Village People and November Rain by Guns N Roses. According to diplomatic sources, the playlist which also included songs like Ring of Fire by Johnny Cash and Hello by Lionel Richie was chosen by Gor himself.Gor was effusive in his praise of Modi, calling him an incredible and great PM. “I was with the President last week, and as we had dinner right after New Year's, he recounted his incredible experience visiting here and also his great friendship with the great Prime Minister of India, Prime Minister Modi,” said Gor, a close Trump aide in his previous role. “I've traveled all over the world with President Trump, and I can attest that his friendship with Prime Minister Modi is real,” said Gor, who is expected to present his credentials to President Droupadi Murmu this week.","Ambassador Sergio Gor was welcomed with a musical extravaganza that played MAGA and Trump favourites like YMCA by Village People and November Rain by Guns N Roses. “No partner is more essential than India.

'Will Come to Mumbai, Try Cutting My Legs: Annamalai Hits Back at Raj Thackeray

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray , who recently forged an alliance with his estranged cousin Uddhav Thackeray ahead of the BMC polls, warned Uttar Pradesh and Bihar migrants against the Hindi imposition.Thackeray said he would ""kick"" people from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh out of Maharashtra if they ""try to impose Hindi"".""People from UP and Bihar should understand that Hindi is not your language. I don't hate the language... But if you try to impose it, I'll kick you. They're coming from all sides to Maharashtra and snatching away your share... If land and language are gone, you will be finished,"" Raj Thackeray was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Calling the BMC polls the ""last election for the Marathi man"", Thackeray said: ""If you miss this opportunity today, you will be finished. Unite for Marathi and Maharashtra.""""Today, this crisis has arrived at your doorstep... This is the last election for the Marathi man... If you miss this opportunity today, you will be finished. Unite for Marathi and Maharashtra. Mumbai was obtained through the sacrifices of so many people... What will we tell them?... The BLA (Booth Level Agents) appointed at 6 AM should be ready on election day... Be alert, be vigilant, don't be careless...If anyone comes to vote again, throw them out,"" Thackeray said.



Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray and his cousin Raj Thackeray on Sunday mounted a joint attack on the rival BJP over what they described as “fake Hindutva” at a rally held ahead of the civic polls, saying their political reunion was prompted by an imminent “danger” to Mumbai.Uddhav said he and Raj Thackeray, who heads the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), had set aside their differences in the interest of the Marathi manoos, Hindus, and Maharashtra.Appealing to the core Marathi votebank, Raj said the two leaders had come together as Mumbai was facing danger.“This is the last election for Marathi manoos. If he makes a mistake now, the battle (for Mumbai) will be lost forever,” he said.Speaking after Raj, the Sena (UBT) chief questioned whether the BJP wanted to rename Mumbai as “Bombay”, referring to remarks made by Tamil Nadu BJP leader K Annamalai.Accusing the BJP of practising divisive politics ahead of elections, Uddhav said, “BJP's Hindutva and nationalism are fake.”“The BJP has become a party which says corruption first, instead of nation first,” he added.","MNS chief Raj Thackeray warns Uttar Pradesh and Bihar migrants against the Hindi imposition.

""The Iranian authorities have arrested and/or detained individuals, including foreign and dual nationals, to exert political or diplomatic influence on their governments. You should leave Iran if you can do so safely. Many airlines have suspended flights to and from Iran at this time, but there are overland crossing options.

Ross: A war veteran

'Ross is Christian, conservative,' says father

Is Ross' wife Filipina?





Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer Jonathan Ross fatally shot Renee Nicole Good on a snowy street in south Minneapolis during a confrontation on Wednesday as she tried to drive away, as debate continued over whether his actions were justified.Trump administration figures, including President Donald Trump, defended Ross and claimed that Good was an agitator who attempted to run him over with her SUV. Witnesses told NBC News that it did not appear Ross was in the direct path of Good’s SUV as she tried to evade ICE officers.Ross served in the military and worked for the govt for years before the shooting. As a member of the Indiana National Guard, he was deployed to Iraq from November 2004 to November 2005, NBC news reported.Specialist Ross of the 138th Signal Battalion earned the Army Commendation Medal, the Army Good Conduct Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Medal and the Iraq Campaign Medal, among others, according to the guard.Court documents showed that during his time in Iraq, Ross was a machine gunner on a combat logistical patrol team. After he returned home, Ross joined the US Border Patrol in 2007 in El Paso, Texas, and worked for the agency until 2015 as a field intelligence agent who gathered and analysed information on drug cartels and human traffickers.Ed Ross, 80, defended his son’s decision to shoot Good, in an exclusive interview with the Daily Mail.""'She hit him,' said Ed Ross, 80. 'He also had an officer whose arm was in the car. He will not be charged with anything.'You would never find a nicer, kinder person,' the father added about his son. 'He's a committed, conservative Christian, a tremendous father, a tremendous husband. I couldn't be more proud of him.'""The father, from North Pekin, Illinois, said his son’s wife was a US citizen but declined to say how long she had been in the US. ""'I do not want to go any further than that,' he added.""Neighbors told the Daily Mail that Ross is a hardcore MAGA supporter.His 38-year-old wife, whose doctor parents lived in the Philippines, married him in August 2012, according to posts on her Instagram page. Her first picture with Ross on the social media account was posted two months earlier.In July 2013, when the couple lived around El Paso, Texas, Ross’s wife posted a picture posing next to a US Border Patrol helicopter. She also shared photos of baking recipes from a Spanish-language cookbook.One neighbour at Ross’s 10-house cul-de-sac told the Daily Mail that until recently Ross had been flying pro-Trump flags and a 'Don't Tread On Me' Gadsden Flag, an emblem of the Make America Great Again movement.","Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer Jonathan Ross fatally shot Renee Nicole Good on a snowy street in south Minneapolis during a confrontation on Wednesday.

BENGALURU: Days after 23-year-old dental student Yashaswini B was found hanging in her bedroom, her mother has accused six of her daughter’s lecturers of abetment to suicide.Based on her complaint, Suryanagar police in Bengaluru Rural district have registered a zero FIR, which has been transferred to Bommanahalli police.Initially, police had registered a case of unnatural death, following a complaint filed by Yashaswini’s mother, G Pramila. However, on Sunday, she submitted a fresh complaint, alleging sustained harassment by a group of lecturers at Oxford Dental College on Hosur Road, leading to the registration of a new case.Based on Pramila’s complaint, police have booked the accused under BNS Section 108 (abetment to suicide). The FIR names lecturers Dr Anmol, Dr Alba, Dr Shabana, Dr Faika, Dr Sindhu, and Dr Sushmini.Yashaswini had left behind a suicide note, stating that she alone was responsible for her death and no one else was to be blamed. The note was sent to the FSL to determine whether the handwriting was hers.Despite the contents of the note, Pramila insisted that her daughter had been subjected to continuous harassment and humiliation by the lecturers over the past year.She claimed Yashaswini was frequently reprimanded for arriving a few minutes late to class and was allegedly targeted over her dressing style.According to the complaint, when Yashaswini did not respond to these remarks, the lecturers allegedly awarded her lower marks in seminars. Pramila said her daughter repeatedly confided in her about the distress and insults she faced at college.Pramila further stated that a day before her death on Jan 8, Yashaswini suffered from eye pain and skipped classes. When she returned to college, she was allegedly insulted in front of her classmates. The lecturers allegedly even questioned her about the medicines she had taken.The complaint also alleges that the lecturers made remarks about Yashaswini’s skin colour and questioned her suitability to become a doctor, asking why she wanted to pursue the profession “with this face”.","23-year-old dental student Yashaswini B was found hanging in her bedroom.

Minnesota BOILS: Tim Walz Confronts Trump, Activates National Guard Amid Anger As ICE Kills American

What was the X post that Jeff Dean quoted

Jesus Freakin Congress' wrote:

🚨BREAKING: Border Patrol just illegally arrested a U.S. citizen… a TEENAGER… in Richfield, Minnesota. The teen was working at Target when agents tackled him and arrested him, while his passport was in his pocket, fully identifying himself as a U.S. citizen.

None of it mattered.

Why? Because he looked Latino.

When a coworker asked who to call, he said, heartbreakingly: “my mom.”

Think about that. Your teenage son goes to work, and Border Patrol kidnaps him.

This isn’t an isolated incident. ICE and Border Patrol have repeatedly illegally arrested U.S. citizens, especially in Minnesota. And after agents murdered a U.S. citizen who tried to drive away from illegal detention, this should outrage every single American.

U.S. citizens do not have to prove their citizenship. Yet, ICE and Border Patrol agents are routinely violating the Constitution, demanding proof anyway… and even refusing to accept drivers licenses or real IDs.

And now? Even a passport doesn’t matter.

This isn’t enforcement… it’s targeting Americans based on fear and appearance, treating citizens like criminals in their own country.

When will this end? When will the government stop stripping citizens of their rights and labeling them terrorists for simply existing?

The United States on Monday issued an advisory asking American citizens to “leave Iran now” amid massive unrest going on in Islamic Republic, warning that protests against the Khamenei regime across the country are “escalating” and could “turn violent”, leading to “arrests, injuries and severe disruptions” to daily life.In the advisory, the US embassy said that protests across Iran “may turn violent” as Iranian authorities step up security measures.“Protests across Iran are escalating and may turn violent, resulting in arrests and injuries. Increased security measures, road closures, public transportation disruptions, and internet blockages are ongoing,” the alert said.It added that the Iranian government has “restricted access to mobile, landline, and national internet networks.”The advisory also warned of travel disruptions, noting that several airlines have limited or cancelled flights to and from Iran. “Airlines continue to limit or cancel flights to and from Iran, with several suspending service until Friday, January 16,” it said.Urging immediate caution, the embassy advised US citizens to consider leaving Iran by land through Armenia and Turkey.“US citizens should expect continued internet outages, plan alternative means of communication, and, if safe to do so, consider departing Iran by land to Armenia or Turkiye,” the alert added.“Leave Iran now. Have a plan for departing Iran that does not rely on US government help,” it said.For those unable to leave, the embassy advised finding a safe place and keeping essential supplies. “If you cannot leave, find a secure location within your residence or another safe building. Have a supply of food, water, medications, and other essential items,” it added.“Avoid demonstrations, keep a low profile, and stay aware of your surroundings,” the embassy said, urging citizens to follow local media updates and stay flexible with travel plans.The advisory also highlighted serious risks for US nationals, especially “dual citizens”. “US-Iranian dual nationals must exit Iran on Iranian passports. The Iranian government does not recognize dual nationality and will treat US-Iranian dual nationals solely as Iranian citizens,” it said.“US nationals are at significant risk of questioning, arrest, and detention in Iran,” the advisory said, adding that “showing a US passport or demonstrating connections to the United States can be reason enough for Iranian authorities to detain someone.”However, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has also issued warning to America, and wrote on X: ""Iran's great nation showcased its resolve and identity to its enemies. This was a warning to US politicians to cease their deceptions and not rely on treacherous mercenaries.""The advisory comes amid reports of large demonstrations across several provinces, including Azerbaijan province and the central city of Arak. According to Iran’s state-run Press TV, crowds were seen waving flags and chanting slogans in support of Iran. The protests and counter-protests follow days of unrest linked to rising inflation, economic hardship and public anger over governance.At least 646 people have been killed and more than 10,000 individuals have been arrested and sent to prisons.Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump has taken a hard stance against the Khamenei-led regime, including moves to target countries doing business with Iran. He stepped up pressure by announcing a 25 per cent tariff with immediate effect.Trump said the tariffs would apply immediately. In a social media post, he wrote, “Effective immediately, any Country doing business with the Islamic Republic of Iran will pay a Tariff of 25% on any and all business being done with the United States of America.”","The U.S. embassy in Tehran issued an advisory asking American citizens to “leave Iran now” It warned that protests across Iran “may turn violent” as Iranian authorities step up security measures.

'DON'T NEED AMERICA': Canada PM Carney CRAWLS To Xi Jinping In Big Shock To Trump & U.S.

Testy relations

'Turning point'

Cosying up to China





BEIJING: Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney will head to Beijing on Tuesday to meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, hoping for closer ties as he looks to reduce his country's dependence on the United States.The trip will be the first by a Canadian leader in almost a decade, as the two sides seek to turn the page on a series of diplomatic spats.Here is why the visit is significant and what it could mean for China-Canada relations:Carney will visit China from Tuesday to Saturday, and is scheduled to meet with Xi and Premier Li Qiang, among other government and business leaders.It will be Carney's first official trip to China as prime minister, and the first visit by a Canadian leader to Beijing since Justin Trudeau's in December 2017.Canada's relations with China have been among the worst of any Western nation. But Carney and Xi in late October held the first formal talks between the countries' leaders since 2017, with the Chinese president inviting the Canadian to visit.Carney's visit will aim to ""elevate engagement on trade, energy, agriculture, and international security"", his office said in a statement on Wednesday.Ties fell into a deep freeze in 2018 after the arrest of the daughter of Huawei's founder on a US warrant in Vancouver, and China's retaliatory detention of two Canadians on espionage charges.Ottawa and Beijing have also imposed tit-for-tat tariffs on each other's products, including Canadian canola used to make cooking oil, animal feed and biodiesel.Carney announced in July a 25 percent tariff on steel imports that contain steel melted and poured in China.The following month, Beijing imposed a painful temporary customs duty of 75.8 percent on canola imports from Canada, which is among the world's top producers of the crop.China has also been accused of interfering in Canadian elections in recent years.The G7, which Canada is a member of, in late October announced new projects aimed at reducing China's dominance of critical mineral supply chains.The first sign of warming ties came in late October with Xi and Carney's meeting on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in October.The Canadian premier called it a ""turning point"" in relations, and said he raised tricky topics such as the alleged Chinese interference in Canadian elections, saying it was ""important to have that discussion"" to get relations ""back on track"".The leaders discussed ""respective sensitivities regarding issues including agriculture and agri-food products, such as canola, as well as seafood and electric vehicles"", according to a Canadian statement.Meanwhile, Xi told Carney that China-Canada relations have ""shown a recovery toward a trend of positive development"" recently with joint efforts of both sides.China was willing to work with Canada to bring relations ""back to the right track"", Xi added.While Canadian foreign policy has for years been hawkish towards China, US President Donald Trump's mercurial trade policies and aggression towards allies could prompt a pivot.The majority of US-Canada trade remains tariff-free, but Canada has been hit particularly hard by Trump's global tariffs on steel, aluminium, vehicles and lumber -- due to the interconnected nature of the neighbouring economies.Trump also previously hiked tariffs on Canada by 10 percent over an anti-tariff ad campaign that featured late US president Ronald Reagan.In October, Carney said Canada should double its non-US exports by 2035 to reduce reliance on the United States.US-Canada trade was worth more than $900 billion in 2024, US government data showed.Canada was also outraged by Trump's calls last year for it to become the 51st US state.With Canada and China both heavily targeted by Trump's tariffs, Carney and Xi will likely try to dial down trade tensions between their two countries.China is Canada's second-largest trade partner, Carney's office said, totalling C$118.7 billion ($85.5 billion) in two-way merchandise trade in 2024.","Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney will visit China from Tuesday to Saturday.

Anti‑Iranian protests in Los Angeles turn chaotic after truck drives into crowd — What we know so far,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/antiiranian-protests-in-los-angeles-turn-chaotic-after-truck-drives-into-crowd-what-we-know-so-far/articleshow/126492172.cms,"



A peaceful demonstration in support of protests in Iran turned chaotic on Sunday in Los Angeles when a U‑Haul truck drove into a crowd of demonstrators.The rally drew hundreds of people expressing solidarity with anti‑Iranian regime protests abroad. Video and eyewitness accounts show the truck entering the area around 3.30pm, causing protesters to scramble out of the way as it moved through the street. Officers later stopped the vehicle several blocks away and took the driver into custody. One person was struck by the truck but did not suffer serious injuries, and others declined medical transport after being checked by emergency crews.After the truck entered the crowd, many protesters swarmed the vehicle. Footage shows people surrounding the truck, smashing its windows, attempting to remove signs from its side and confronting the driver. Some demonstrators tried to pull the driver out of the vehicle and struck it with flagpoles before police pushed the crowd back. Authorities eventually escorted the driver into custody as the situation remained tense at the scene.Los Angeles police confirmed that the adult male driver was detained “pending further investigation”.Captain Mike Bland of the LAPD said the incident is under review and could lead to assault charges, with the vehicle being treated as a possible deadly weapon.The identity of the driver or the details are still not public as of Monday. The truck displayed political slogans referencing Iran’s 1953 coup, but officials have not called the event a terrorist act. Law enforcement has asked for witness footage and statements to help clarify what occurred.The protest in Westwood was part of a wave of demonstrations by Iranian communities and supporters across the world reacting to protests and a harsh government response in Iran itself. Unrest in the Middle East has drawn global attention, with many in the diaspora calling for change and an end to violent crackdowns under the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei.","A U‑Haul truck drove into a crowd of demonstrators in Los Angeles.

Khamenei 'PANICS' As US Military Puts Attack Options On Table





The White House has confirmed that President Donald Trump is considering military options, including airstrikes, in Iran as anti-government protests continue to turn deadly.""One thing President Trump is very good at is always keeping all of his options on the table,"" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Monday. ""And airstrikes would be one of the many, many options that are on the table for the commander-in-chief. Diplomacy is always the first option for the president.""Leavitt added: ""The president has shown he's unafraid to use military options if and when he deems necessary, and nobody knows that better than Iran.""Trump earlier said that the military is reviewing potential actions. ""The military is looking at it, and we're looking at some very strong options. We'll make a determination,"" he said. The POTUS has also vowed that the United States would intervene if Iranian officials target peaceful protesters.The unrest in Iran began in late December 2025 over worsening economic hardship, high inflation and the falling value of the rial.Protests started in Tehran’s Grand Bazaar and spread across all 31 provinces. Millions have taken to the streets, demanding political change and the end of the Islamic Republic’s rule. Hundreds of died and dozens others remain injured.Security forces have cracked down on demonstrators with live ammunition, tear gas and mass arrests. Rights groups describe the protests as some of the deadliest since 2022. Iranian authorities have also cut internet access and accused foreign actors of interfering.The protests come amid heightened tensions following US-led airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities in June 2025. Washington said the strikes were intended to slow Tehran’s nuclear programme. Iran condemned the attacks as a violation of international law and vowed that its nuclear sites would continue development despite the strikes.","The White House has confirmed that President Donald Trump is considering military options, including airstrikes, in Iran.

"Mississippi synagogue fire: 19-year-old Stephen Spencer Pittman identified as suspect, called it 'Satan's building'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/mississippi-synagogue-fire-19-year-old-stephen-spencer-pittman-identified-as-suspect-called-it-satans-building/articleshow/126492149.cms,"



Authorities have identified Stephen Spencer Pittman as the man accused of setting fire to a historic synagogue in Jackson, Mississippi.19-year-old Pittman from Madison, Mississippi, was charged on Monday with maliciously damaging or destroying a building by means of fire or an explosive.The fire broke out shortly after 3 am on Saturday at the Beth Israel Congregation, the largest and only synagogue in Mississippi’s capital. No congregants or firefighters were injured, but the blaze heavily damaged the building’s library and administrative offices, and several scrolls were destroyed or damaged.According to an FBI affidavit filed in US District Court in Mississippi, Pittman admitted to setting the fire because of the synagogue’s “Jewish ties.” During questioning, he referred to the building as the “synagogue of Satan,” law enforcement said.Security camera footage released by the synagogue showed a masked and hooded person using a gas can to pour liquid on the floor and a couch in the lobby before the blaze started. Pittman told investigators he had stopped at a gas station on the way and purchased the gasoline used in the fire. He also removed his vehicle’s licence plate.The suspect’s father alerted authorities after receiving a message from his son, and a burned cell phone believed to belong to Pittman was recovered by the FBI. A hand torch found at the scene was also turned over to investigators.Beth Israel Congregation was founded in 1860 and steeped in civil rights history. It was previously bombed by the Ku Klux Klan (KKK), a white supremacist group, in 1967. Community leaders condemned the latest attack, and the synagogue’s president pledged to rebuild with support from local churches.Mayor John Horhn of Jackson called the arson a threat to community safety and religious freedom. The suspect was treated for non‑life‑threatening burns and, once medically cleared, is expected to face further legal proceedings.","Stephen Spencer Pittman, 19, charged with maliciously damaging or destroying a building by means of fire or an explosive.

Cuba's president says no current talks with the US following Trump's threats,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/cubas-president-says-no-current-talks-with-the-us-following-trumps-threats/articleshow/126494907.cms,".





HAVANA: Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel said Monday that his administration is not in talks with the US government, a day after President Donald Trump threatened the Caribbean island in the wake of the US attack on Venezuela.Diaz-Canel posted a flurry of brief statements on X after Trump suggested that Cuba ""make a deal, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE."" He did not say what kind of deal.Diaz-Canel wrote that for ""relations between the US and Cuba to progress, they must be based on international law rather than hostility, threats, and economic coercion.""He added: ""We have always been willing to hold a serious and responsible dialogue with the various US governments, including the current one, on the basis of sovereign equality, mutual respect, principles of International Law, and mutual benefit without interference in internal affairs and with full respect for our independence.""His statements were reposted by Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez on X.A key lifeline severed On Sunday, Trump wrote that Cuba would no longer live off oil and money from Venezuela, which the US attacked on Jan. 3 in a stunning operation that killed 32 Cuban officers and led to the arrest of President Nicolas Maduro.Cuba was receiving an estimated 35,000 barrels a day from Venezuela before the US attacked, along with some 5,500 barrels daily from Mexico and roughly 7,500 from Russia, according to Jorge Pinon of the Energy Institute at the University of Texas at Austin, who tracks the shipments.On Monday, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum once again declined to provide data on current oil shipments or say whether such shipments would increase when Venezuelan supplies end. She insisted that the aid ""has been ongoing for a long time; it's not new.""Sheinbaum said Mexico's fuel supply to Cuba is not a concern for her country because ""there is enough oil"" - even though production of state-owned oil company Petroleos Mexicanos is steadily declining. She reiterated that her government is willing to facilitate dialogue between the US and Cuba if both agree.Even with oil shipments from Venezuela, widespread blackouts have persisted across Cuba given fuel shortages and a crumbling electric grid. Experts worry a lack of petroleum would only deepen the island's multiple crises that stem from an economic paralysis during the Covid-19 pandemic and a radical increase in US sanctions following the first Trump administration, which aim to force a change in Cuba's political model.The communist government has said US sanctions cost the country more than $7.5 billion between March 2024 and February 2025, a staggering sum for an island whose tourism revenue reached some $3 billion annually at its peak in the previous decade.The crisis also has triggered a large wave of migration primarily to the United States, where Cubans enjoyed immigration privileges as exiles. Those privileges were curtailed before Trump closed US borders.'They didn't even bring Cuban coffee' The situation between the US and Cuba is ""very sad and concerning,"" said Andy S. Gomez, retired dean of the School of International Studies and senior fellow in Cuban Studies at the University of Miami.He said he sees Diaz-Canel's latest comments ""as a way to try and buy a little bit of time for the inner circle to decide what steps it's going to take.""Gomez said he doesn't visualize Cuba reaching out to US officials right now.""They had every opportunity when President (Barack) Obama opened up US diplomatic relations, and yet they didn't even bring Cuban coffee to the table,"" Gomez said. ""Of course, these are desperate times for Cuba.""Michael Galant, senior research and outreach associate at the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, D.C., said he believes Cuba might be willing to negotiate.""Cuba has been interested in finding ways to ease sanctions,"" he said. ""It's not that Cuba is uncooperative.""Galant said topics for discussion could include migration and security, adding that he believes Trump is not in a hurry.""Trump is hoping to deepen the economic crisis on the island, and there are few costs to Trump to try and wait that out,"" he said. ""I don't think it's likely that there will be any dramatic action in the coming days because there is no rush to come to the table.""Cuba's president stressed on X that ""there are no talks with the US government, except for technical contacts in the area of migration.""As tensions remained heightened, life went on as usual for many Cubans, although some were more concerned than others.Oreidy Guzman, a 32- year-old food delivery person, said he doesn't want anything bad to happen to Cubans, ""but if something has to happen, the people deserve change.""Meanwhile, 37-year-old homemaker Meilyn Gomez said that while she doesn't believe the US would invade Cuba, she was preparing for any possible outcome under Trump: ""He'll find entertainment anywhere.""The current situation is dominating chatter among Cubans on the island and beyond.""Cuban people talk and talk,"" said 57-year-old bartender Ruben Benitez, ""but to be honest, eleven, eight or nine million will take to the streets to defend what little we have left.""","President Miguel Diaz-Canel says his administration is not in talks with the US government.

TOI correspondent from Washington:

Trump Declares Himself ‘Acting President’ Of Venezuela, Spills The Beans On $50M Oil Deal With Delcy

Rubio to coordinate Caracas governance with interim president





Donald Trump posted on Truth Social a fake Wikipedia profile calling him ""acting president"" of Venezuela, seemingly mocking the besieged country, United Nations, and the global community.While the charitable explanation from some analysts is that he is trolling Venezuela and the world, concern and outrage rippled through many who said he is emboldened by the silence and tacit concurrence of most countries to the US takeover of a sovereign nation. Delcy Rodriguez, who was vice-president to abducted president Nicolas Maduro, is currently acting president of Venezuela.Trump had detailed secretary of state Marco Rubio —now dubbed “Viceroy” of Venezuela — to coordinate its governance with Delcy Rodriguez, the US-designated interim Venezuelan president who was deposed President Nicolas Maduro’s deputy. Trump had openly threatened Rodriguez, saying if she doesn’t give US corporations “total access” to “the oil and other things”, she would “pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro”.It is unclear if Rodriguez, who is currently cooperating with the US, is doing so voluntarily or at gunpoint. But Trump’s hardball is not going down well with Americans critic outside the ambit of MAGA. “A US president declaring himself president of another nation 1,000 miles from his own nation’s borders is unhinged criminality.This is done to prime the US public for wider criminality to come,” Brian Berletic, a former US Marine who writes on geopolitics, said in a post on X.While several countries, notably China, Russia, and Brazil have condemned US takeover of Venezuela, others like Argentina, Ecuador, and Israel have supported the US action. Some others, like the EU, UK, and India, have taken a “middle ground” of strategic acquiescence that falls short of outright condemnation, which, critics say, will embolden Trump administration to flex its muscles elsewhere across the world.","Donald Trump posted on Truth Social a fake Wikipedia profile calling him ""acting president"" of Venezuela.

But it’s standard protocol to pickup someone working at Target and then when they verify their citizenship you just dump them miles away?





A video showing an immigration agent entering a portable toilet with a handcuffed person has gone viral on social media and drawn an official response from the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS).The video showed an agent and a detainee near a porta-potty in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota. In many posts, users suggested the person being led inside was a woman and criticised the officer’s actions, with questions raised over what occurred behind the closed door, like sexual assault.In response, the DHS said the person in the footage was not a woman but a man who needed to use the restroom. The department said it does not deny people in custody the right to use a toilet. “The illegal alien in this video was a male and had to use restroom,” a DHS spokesperson said. “We don’t deny people the right to use the bathroom.”The department explained that standard policy in such situations is to never allow a subject alone in an enclosed space because someone under arrest “could barricade themselves in.” This guidance was reiterated by DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin who said the policy is longstanding and applies to all detainees.Some social media users alleged inappropriate behaviour and questioned why the agent entered the porta-potty with the detainee. Others pointed out that the video’s content is too brief to determine exactly what happened after the door was closed.The clip comes amid heightened focus on ICE tactics nationally, particularly following other controversial incidents involving federal agents in Minneapolis, where an agent fatally shot a woman last week.","The video showed an agent and a detainee near a porta-potty in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota.

Trump and Leavitt's flirty relationship



Trump's history of surprising comments







American President Donald Trump is known for his fun-loving nature and peculiar humour to many. The 79-year-old Republican president does not shy away from expressing anything that comes to his mind. From veering away in speeches to reading notes out loud, he has acknowledged his own tendencies to wander in verbal speech.However, his most recent comment about White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has not made the internet double down with laughter. It has them furious over the President.While aboard Air Force One on January 11, Trump was engaged in a mid-flight press interview as he returned to Washington from his stay at Mar-a-Lago in Florida. When the plane hit unexpected turbulence, he began searching for something to hold onto and balance himself with. Then, made a remark about the only person standing behind him, Karoline Leavitt.“I’m looking for something to grab here because it’s going to get rough. I don’t seem to be in a great… I think you did this to me. You put me in a position where there is absolutely nothing to grab. So I’m looking for something to grab, and it’s not going to be Karoline,” he said on camera.As he turned back to search for something to grab, Leavitt stepped aside showing him a handle nearby to grab on.The video of the seemingly humorous exchange quickly went viral online, prompting numerous comments condemning the President's thoughtless remark and raising questions about appropriateness and tone.“What A Creep!,"" wrote an X user.""Karoline is smiling but she is scared of Trump not sure what he may do,"" pointed out another.""Always with the tasteless comments, even at a moment like that,"" condemned one.""Absolute Clownism from him,"" quipped another.Interestingly, this isn't the first time Trump has made a comment on the 28-year-old press secretary. Previously, he has made a lengthy comment about Leavitt's physical appearance and professional prowess. “She’s become a star. It’s that face. It’s that brain. It’s those lips, the way they move. They move like she’s a machine gun,” he said.The comparison of Leavitt's lips to a 'machine gun' drew immediate online criticism with many dubbing the remark inappropriate.Karoline Leavitt isn't the only woman Trump has made eye-raising comments about. During the Christmas reception at the White House, Trump paused midway and grinned at a woman in the crowd. “Boy, you look like Ivanka,” he said, referring to his 44-year-old daughter. “Has anyone ever told you that? I’m looking and saying, ‘Is that Ivanka?’”He even asked the woman to ""turn around for the camera"" asking the crowd to weigh in, “Doesn’t she look like Ivanka? It’s the most unbelievable thing,” he declared.Before that he also made a shocking comment about his wife's undergarments. Speaking at a North Carolina rally in December 2025, he went off-topic to talk about the FBI raid on his Mar-a-Lago resort in 2022. “They went into my wife's closet ... they looked at her drawers,” he said, referring to Melania.

Mark Ruffalo to Jean Smart: Hollywood celebrities wear ‘Be Good’ pins to honour Renee Nicole Good at Golden Globes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/mark-ruffalo-to-jean-smart-hollywood-celebrities-wear-be-good-pins-to-honour-renee-nicole-good-at-golden-globes/articleshow/126490134.cms,"



At the 83rd Golden Globe Awards on 11 January 2026, several Hollywood actors used the ceremony’s global spotlight to make a subdued political statement by wearing “Be Good” pins on the red carpet. The pins were worn in tribute to Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old US citizen, poet and mother of three who was fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent during a raid in Minneapolis earlier this month.Among those seen wearing the pins were Mark Ruffalo Wanda Sykes and Natasha Lyonne . The badges were visible during red carpet appearances, with Smart also wearing hers while accepting an award onstage.The phrase “Be Good” has become associated with campaigns calling for accountability in immigration enforcement following Good’s death. Supporters say the wording reflects a call for restraint and humanity rather than a confrontational slogan, allowing the message to be carried through symbolism rather than speeches.Federal authorities have described the shooting as self-defence, alleging that Good obstructed agents with her vehicle during the operation. Minneapolis officials reviewing body camera footage have disputed that account, calling the agent’s actions reckless.The incident has triggered large-scale protests across the city and beyond, alongside a fundraiser that has raised more than $1.4 million for Good’s family.The appearance of the pins at the Golden Globes quickly became one of the night’s most discussed moments. Supporters praised the actors for using a high-visibility cultural event to draw attention to an ongoing investigation and broader concerns around immigration enforcement.As the investigation into Renee Nicole Good’s killing continues, the moment at the Golden Globes highlights how major entertainment events can be used to bring national debates into the spotlight, even during ceremonies focused on celebration.","Mark Ruffalo Wanda Sykes and Natasha Lyonne were among those seen wearing the pins.

Pro-trans activist says her ‘identity has been wiped’ as US passport system tells her she doesn’t exist,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pro-trans-activist-says-her-identity-has-been-wiped-as-us-passport-system-tells-her-she-doesnt-exist/articleshow/126488676.cms,"Global Entry revoked without warning



Activism and fears of federal targeting



Passport renewal leads to a more disturbing discovery



Broader policy backdrop







Alexis Rose, a registered nurse and pro-trans activist who goes by @travelingnurselex on social media, says she was effectively erased from the US passport system, triggering fears about how recent federal actions targeting transgender people may be playing out in real life.Rose, a trans woman with more than 376,000 followers, shared her account in a video posted on January 8, 2026, explaining that she was urged to speak publicly after what she describes as an unprecedented and deeply unsettling encounter with multiple federal systems.“I was urged to make this video by the office of my congressional representatives which is a crazy thing to say out loud,” she said. “Someone or something in the Trump administration wiped my existence from the US Passport database.”According to Rose, the first sign something was wrong came in the early hours of December 19, 2025. She said she received a notification at 2:17 a.m. local time in Los Angeles informing her that her access to the Global Entry Travel Programme had been revoked.The reason given, she said, was that she “no longer met the requirements for the Global Entry Programme.”Global Entry, run by US Customs and Border Protection, allows pre-approved, low-risk travellers expedited entry into the United States and includes automatic access to TSA PreCheck.Eligibility typically depends on factors such as criminal history, valid identification, and national security checks.Rose said none of the standard disqualifiers applied to her. “Now the requirements are not having been charged with felony. Check. Never been charged with a felony,” she said. “Having valid identification and documents. Check. My passport was not expired.”She added that another eligibility condition stood out given the timing. “And one of the last things on the eligibility list was not under investigation for terrorism.”Rose linked the revocation to her work as a trans advocate and healthcare provider. She said the same day her Global Entry access was revoked, US Attorney General Pam Bondi sent a letter to the FBI requesting that pro-trans activists be labeled as domestic terrorists.“Well that exact day, Pam Bondi sent a letter to the FBI requesting that Pro Trans activists be labelled as domestic terrorist,” Rose said.Earlier in December, the Justice Department instructed the FBI to intensify investigations into what it describes as “domestic terrorist” organisations, a category that now includes groups promoting what the administration calls “radical gender ideology.” Bondi issued a memorandum on December 4, directing prosecutors and law enforcement agencies to act under NSPM-7, President Donald Trump’s September directive ordering investigations into domestic extremist groups.Rose said her activism is not theoretical or online-only.“So as many of you guys know, I am a pro trans activist. I have worked with ACLU during the US vs. Skrmetti case. I have a trans partner. I have a trans sister, I am blessed to have many trans friends and I have worked as a healthcare provider, providing gender affirming care for trans youth.”Initially, Rose said she was told the Global Entry issue might be a clerical mistake. On advice from attorneys and contacts in federal agencies, she applied to renew her passport online, since it is set to expire later this year.What followed, she said, was even more alarming.“I was then told that no one with my identity was found anywhere in the US passport system,” Rose said.She contacted her congressional representative’s office, where a field staffer told her the notice was highly unusual. She was informed that some people have previously been removed from the system after their passports were mistakenly marked as lost or stolen.“That is not what happened to me,” Rose said, stressing that the message she received was different and explicitly stated that no record of her identity existed in the system.Rose’s experience comes amid a rapid escalation of federal action against transgender healthcare and advocacy. In December, 2025, the Department of Health and Human Services announced it would ban all forms of trans healthcare for youth and cut public funding to hospitals that continue to provide such care. The proposed rules aim to restrict puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and surgical interventions for transgender children, including barring Medicaid and Medicare funding.According to the Associated Press, 27 states already have laws restricting or banning trans healthcare for youth, while only 15 states have protections in place.These regulatory changes overlap with legislation recently passed in the House, including HR 498, which seeks to ban Medicaid coverage for trans-related care.Rose says she is now waiting for an in-person appointment with the US passport agency, scheduled for Tuesday, where she hopes to finally get clarity on what happened.In a follow-up video, she said she remains unsure whether her passport could be confiscated or whether she will be able to travel freely again.She ended her initial video with a plea to her audience: “If I go dark, I need you guys to be really loud.”As of now, Rose says she has received no official explanation for why her Global Entry access was revoked or why her identity appears to have vanished from the passport system, leaving her questioning how two separate government agencies were alerted to her at the same time, and what that might mean going forward.","Alexis Rose, a registered nurse and pro-trans activist, says she was effectively erased from the US passport system.

Open Letter From Pakistan Backs India As Baloch Leader Signals Diplomatic Break With Islamabad





A fresh surge of enforced disappearances has been reported across Balochistan, Karachi, and adjoining regions, with nine more Baloch citizens allegedly taken away by Pakistsecurity agencies in recent weeks.Human rights defenders stated that these incidents follow a familiar pattern: individuals are arrested without warrants, held in secret locations, and never brought before a court, as reported by The Balochistan Post.According to The Balochistan Post, sources in Mand, Kech district, stated that Abdullah, son of Iqbal, was whisked away and shifted to an unknown facility. In Karachi, 24-year-old student Hamdan, son of Muhammad Ali, was detained by CTD officials in the Golimar area, with no subsequent legal proceedings or public acknowledgement of his custody.On November 2, 2025, three youths, Dawood Baloch, Usman Baloch, and Hakeem Majeed Baloch, were picked up during early-morning raids in Bhatta Colony by teams from Military Intelligence and the CTD. Their whereabouts remain undisclosed.Additional cases include the late-night detention of religious instructor Zubair from Quetta's Lak Pass area on November 20; the abduction of labourer Muhammad Iqbal Marri from outside the Rakhni Sessions Court in Barkhan on December 26; and the raid in Mastung on 11 December in which Frontier Corps and CTD personnel allegedly took 21-year-old herder Saeed Ahmed.Families say none of these detainees have resurfaced. According to another report, 17-year-old student Jamal Murad was apprehended in Gwadar on 2 January by CTD and Military Intelligence operatives, after which he disappeared.The Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP) continued its protest camp outside the Quetta Press Club, marking its 6,052nd day. Families, including the relatives of Nasreena Baloch, reportedly detained during a raid in Hub Chowki, joined the demonstration.Her family stated that local police refused to register an FIR, while the Hub Press Club was locked to stop their press briefing, as highlighted by The Balochistan Post.VBMP Chairman Nasrullah Baloch accused state institutions of weaponising national security to intensify enforced disappearances, even targeting Baloch women. He said detainees are denied legal rights, courts are bypassed, and new laws merely protect extrajudicial actions.He called on national and international bodies to take meaningful steps to end the crisis and secure the release of all missing persons, as reported by The Balochistan Post.","A fresh surge of enforced disappearances has been reported across Balochistan, Karachi, and adjoining regions.

No IMF Loan In 6 Months? Pakistan Defence Minister’s Jet Export Claim Collapses Under Debt Reality





Pakistan on Saturday claimed that Iraq has expressed “keen interest” in acquiring JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak training aircraft, following talks between the air chiefs of the two countries.According to a statement issued by the Pakistan Army, air chief marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu, chief of air staff of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF), met lieutenant general staff pilot Mohanad Ghalib Mohammed Radi Al-Asadi, commander of the Iraqi Air Force, during an official visit to Iraq.The discussions focused on enhancing bilateral military cooperation, including joint training, capacity building and operational coordination.“The Iraqi air chief praised PAF’s professionalism and technological advancement, expressed interest in benefiting from PAF’s world-class training and expressed keen interest in JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak trainer aircraft,” the statement said, as quoted by news agency PTI.Both sides also agreed to pursue joint exercises and training initiatives to strengthen interoperability between the two air forces.The JF-17 Thunder is a single-engine, lightweight combat aircraft jointly developed by China’s Chengdu Aircraft Corporation and the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex.Pakistan has claimed that the aircraft proved its capabilities during last year’s conflict with India, although its effectiveness remains disputed.Pakistan had also deployed Chinese-origin J-10 fighter jets during the May 7–10 hostilities with India.The development comes days after Pakistan and Bangladesh air chiefs held talks on the “potential procurement” of JF-17 jets by Dhaka. However, Bangladesh has not officially confirmed any such plan.Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif recently claimed that the country has seen increased interest in its fighter aircraft following the May 2025 standoff with India. Reports have also suggested that Pakistan is exploring similar defence deals with other countries, including Saudi Arabia, amid ongoing financial pressures.Notably, Pakistan has repeatedly relied on International Monetary Fund support in recent years, with the IMF approving a $7 billion bailout in September 2024 and an additional $1.4 billion loan in May 2025.",Iraq has expressed “keen interest’ in acquiring JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak training aircraft. Talks between air chiefs of the two countries focused on enhancing bilateral military cooperation.
