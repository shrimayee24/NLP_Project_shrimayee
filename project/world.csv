.

.

AHMEDABAD: One Indian was caught at the US border every 20 minutes in 2025, a stark measure of how the American dream continues to pull immigrants through illegal and increasingly dangerous routes despite an aggressive crackdown.US Customs and Border Protection caught 23,830 Indians in 2025, far below the staggering 85,119 caught in 2024, yet enough to keep India among the top source countries. Most of them were single adults but agencies flagged a darker trend: a small flow of unaccompanied kids.Four years after the Jan 2022 Dingucha tragedy, when four of a Gandhinagar family froze to death while crossing from Canada to the US, kids continue to be abandoned near borders.The 2025 figures underscore a central paradox: enforcement has reduced numbers, but not the urge to try. For thousands, the promise of USA still outweighs walls, patrols and peril.US border officials link the drop to stepped-up surveillance, policy shifts under President Donald Trump and a sweeping enforcement drive by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Smuggling corridors have narrowed, patrols intensified and penalties sharpened.Still, attempts continue.“Data shows deterrence, not elimination,” said experts tracking migration flows. They point to the enduring economic and social pull of US, paired with smuggling networks that quickly rewire routes when pressure mounts.Indian agencies monitoring illegal immigration, particularly from Gujarat, echo that assessment. “There is a huge decrease due to stricter US policies and a massive crackdown by agencies, including ICE,” said a senior officer, adding, “But the numbers are still there because the aspiration of settling in US, especially among Gujaratis, continues.”Mexico remains a key pathway, but 2025 marked a visible shift north. More Indians were intercepted along the Canada-US border, reflecting how smugglers are abandoning the heavily policed Latin American corridors for riskier alternatives.“Routes via Mexico and Canada through hubs like Dubai and Istanbul were the main illegal channels. These routes are now heavily hampered,” the officer said. “People who want to illegally enter US are still trying through newer, riskier paths.”","One Indian was caught at the US border every 20 minutes in 2025.

Gridlock forces many tourists trek downhill from Manali



.

KULLU: A 10-hour traffic crawl for 15km. Sub-zero cold. Tourists ditch cars, walk on ice.Thousands of tourists remained stranded in Manali for a second straight day Sunday as icy roads and an unprecedented traffic surge brought the popular hill town in Himachal Pradesh's Kullu district to a standstill.Exit routes out of Manali were the worst hit. Slippery stretches and tailgating vehicles produced jams stretching more than 10km, all the way to the 15 Mile point near Patlikuhal, a small market town lower down the valley where snow had begun melting.A viral video allegedly shot around 2.30 am Sunday showed tourists hauling trolley bags across ice, some slipping and falling. ""This is the situation of people who rushed to Manali, ended up stranded,"" wrote an X user, @rose_k01. For hundreds, the ordeal stretched through the night. Buses, taxis and cars barely moved as mercury plunged below freezing. Many, including children, spent Saturday night shivering inside vehicles. ""It took us 12 hours just to reach Patlikuhal,"" said Kulwinder Singh from Ferozepur, Punjab. ""We spent the night shivering in the car. I have never seen such a nightmarish traffic jam.""This is the situation of people who rushed to Manali, ended up stranded,” wrote an X user, @rose_k01.For hundreds, the ordeal stretched through the night.

Many, including children, spent Saturday night shivering inside vehicles. “It took us 12 hours just to reach Patlikuhal,” said Kulwinder Singh from Ferozepur, Punjab. “We spent the night shivering in the car. I have never seen such a nightmarish traffic jam.”The distance from Manali to Patlikuhal is roughly 15km. For many, it took more than 10 hours.Despite snow-clearing efforts by NHAI, icy patches and sheer traffic volume rendered the two-lane Kullu-Manali highway nearly impassable. Weather stayed largely clear through Saturday and Sunday, but the road did not.Frustration boiled over. Desperate to escape, several tourists abandoned vehicles and trekked downhill on foot toward Patlikuhal. “This is easily the worst jam I’ve ever seen,” said Himanshu Sharma, a tourist from Noida. “I can reach Patlikuhal faster on foot than by car.”As thousands tried to get out, thousands more attempted to get in — chasing snowfall in Manali. Police blocked fresh inflow at Patlikuhal and Bhuntar, the valley town near Kullu airport. “We are only allowing 4x4 vehicles beyond Patlikuhal to prioritise evacuation of stranded tourists,” said Manali DSP K D Sharma. Kullu SP Madan Lal called the rush unprecedented. About 200 police personnel have been deployed round the clock, but the narrow mountain highway remains overwhelmed.More trouble may be coming. The Met office in Shimla has forecast another spell of heavy rain and snow from the night of Jan 26 through Jan 28. A severe cold wave continues across the Himalayan state. Tabo village in the remote Lahaul-Spiti district recorded the state’s lowest temperature Sunday at -10 degrees Celsius. Manali dropped to -1.1 degrees C.","Exit routes out of Manali were the worst hit. Slippery stretches and tailgating vehicles produced jams stretching more than 10km.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday expressed grief over the death of veteran journalist and author Mark Tully. He remembered Tully as a “towering voice of journalism” whose work reflected a deep connection with India and its people.In a post on X, PM Modi wrote, “Saddened by the passing of Sir Mark Tully, a towering voice of journalism. His connect with India and the people of our nation was reflected in his works. His reporting and insights have left an enduring mark on public discourse. Condolences to his family, friends and many admirers.”Tully, 90, passed away at Max Hospital in Saket on Sunday afternoon. The news was confirmed by his close friend and fellow journalist Satish Jacob.Hospital said that Tully had been admitted on January 21 under the nephrology department.

"Body found by cops not that of wife, man acquitted after 8 years",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/body-found-by-cops-not-that-of-wife-man-acquitted-after-8-years/articleshow/127510408.cms,".

GHAZIABAD: A man jailed for nearly eight years for allegedly murdering his wife and dumping her body in a drain was acquitted after the court found gaping holes in the prosecution story - starting with the most basic question that whether the body police recovered was even that of the missing woman.The additional sessions court also held that the prosecution failed to establish any motive for the alleged murder, and that the case, built entirely on circumstantial evidence, did not form an unbroken chain that pointed only to the accused.Rajiv Poddar, originally from Darbhanga in Bihar, was arrested on Aug 28, 2018, under sections 302 (murder) and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence) of IPC in connection with the disappearance of his wife, Sanjana. He had remained in jail since then, with even the Allahabad High Court rejecting his bail plea. On Thursday, the additional sessions court ordered his immediate release after acquitting him of all charges.The case began with an FIR being lodged at Vijaynagar police station on Aug 19, 2018, by Poddar himself, alleging that his wife was missing.On Aug 25 that year, when police recovered the body of a woman from a drain, Sanjana's brother, Rajesh, identified it as his sister's and alleged that Poddar must have killed her and disposed of the body.A case was registered on Aug 27 and Poddar was arrested the next day.During trial, the defence argued that the prosecution could never prove that the recovered body was Sanjana's. ""The body of the deceased unidentified woman was unidentifiable. The plaintiff's evidence does not clearly state the basis on which he identified the deceased as his sister, Sanjana, nor did the prosecution produce any witness to prove that the body of the deceased unidentified woman was actually that of Sanjana,"" defence counsel DK Mishra and Vikas Chaturvedi submitted.The case also involved a second body - that of a child - found along with the woman's body. Both bodies were mutilated, and the child's body was never identified - a gap that further complicated the prosecution's narrative about who the victims were and what exactly happened.The defence also argued that Poddar and Sanjana had three children, all of whom were with their father at home.A key discrepancy highlighted in court was between the complainant's claim of identification and the body's measurements recorded by investigators and medical evidence, which did not conclusively match Sanjana's description. The court noted that without reliable identification, the prosecution's central claim - that Sanjana was murdered and that the recovered body was hers - remained unproven.Police filed a chargesheet on Nov 6, 2018. A case under the Arms Act was registered over a knife that cops said was the murder weapon.But the court found the recovery doubtful. It recorded that prosecution witnesses admitted the recovery spot was a road frequented by people. ""Members of the public were also present at the time of the recovery, but the recovery report did not name any witnesses,"" the court noted.The judge said the prosecution's evidence did not establish a complete chain of circumstances, did not prove motive, and did not show that Poddar disposed of the body to destroy evidence.","Rajiv Poddar, originally from Darbhanga in Bihar, was arrested on Aug 28, 2018, in connection with the disappearance of his wife, Sanjana.

‘Justice Delayed Is Justice Destroyed’: CJI Kant Calls High Courts Key Guardians Of Citizens’ Rights

SC order puts end to judiciary-rlys tussle over

manpower row

NEW DELHI: Citing the age-old proverb that 'No man shall be a judge in his own cause', Supreme Court has said the same is applicable to a judge also and they cannot pass an order in a case concerning themselves.A railway magistrate had initiated proceedings against railway administration and its officials, issuing a showcause notice for not providing him with requisite staff for checking tickets on rail premises and penalising offenders. But a bench of Justices M M Sundresh and N K Singh reversed the Punjab and Haryana HC's order in the magistrate's favour. ""It is a case where the learned railway magistrate wants to become a judge of his own cause,"" SC said.The communication sent by him (the railway magistrate) to appellant no. 3 (senior divisional commercial manager of Northern Railways) cannot be termed as a judicial proceeding. In any case, the appellants have not acted beyond their official capacity,” the SC bench added.Supreme Court’s order brought to an end the tug-of-war between judiciary and railways administration arising out of criminal proceedings initiated against the commercial manager of Northern Railways for not providing sufficient manpower to the judicial officer.Special railway magistrate (SRM) at Ambala had passed the order and lodged a complaint against the officer, on grounds that he was being prevented from discharging his duties.The SRM conducts checks which are known as ‘magisterial checks’ to detect passengers travelling without tickets and also to punish persons guilty of other offences as provided under Railways Act. After not being provided with manpower to conduct ticket checks, the SRM had said it was a prima facie case of interference in his judicial functioning and issued a showcause notice to the railways official and a complaint was sent to chief judicial magistrate, Ambala, for trial.The railways administration and commercial manager of Northern Railways then moved Punjab and Haryana high court, which rejected their plea. The HC said the petitioner’s move to withdraw the checking staff was not only unfair but also reprimandable and directed the railways authorities to make available checking staff. “None of the railways authorities has any power to oust the jurisdiction of special railway magistrate in this regard,” HC said.But SC disagreed with the reasoning and quashed the proceedings in the case.",A railway magistrate had initiated proceedings against railway administration and its officials. The magistrate had issued a showcause notice for not providing him with requisite staff for checking tickets on rail premises and penalising offenders.

SRINAGAR:

From the snow-covered slopes of Gulmarg, J&K CM Omar Abdullah Sunday said Ladakh should be re-merged with the state and welcomed BJP’s official rejection of any further bifurcation of UT of J&K.“BJP legislators initially made statements about dividing Jammu and Kashmir . Now, if Tarun Chugh (BJP national general secretary) has clarified this is not the party’s stand. It is a good thing,” Omar told reporters after riding a snow scooter and skiing at the resort.“They (BJP) separated Ladakh from J&K and ruined it. We are saying Ladakh should be merged back with J&K,” he said.The CM also rejected any proposal to divide Jammu further. “We are not in favour of separating Jammu. Such theories are floated by BJP legislators and a few people in Kashmir who are close to the BJP,” he said.On August 5, 2019, the Union government abrogated Articles 370, 35A, which gave special status to J&K, and bifurcated and downgraded J&K into two Union Territories, UT of J&K and UT of Ladakh.A debate over the further bifurcation of J&K UT began early this month after BJP legislator Sham Lal Sharma pitched for a separate Jammu state, alleging discrimination against the region by “Kashmir-based rulers.”Several BJP legislators, including Vikram Randhawa, have since accused the CM of running the Kashmiri government and imposing “Kashmiri sentiment” on Jammu.Many in Kashmir, like Peoples Conference chairman Sajad Lone, in response advocated separation of two regions. “Maybe the time has come for an amicable divorce. This is not just about development. Jammu has become the proverbial stick to beat Kashmiris with,” Lone said.PDP president Mehbooba Mufti has rejected bifurcation of J&K, though she has sought two separate divisions in Jammu for Pir Panjal region of Rajouri Poonch and Chenab Valley comprising Kishtwar, Doda and Ramban.However, on Friday, leader of opposition in J&K Assembly, Sunil Sharma, and Chugh said under no circumstances will J&K ever be separated and the party’s top leadership is firmly committed to the unity and integrity of the Union Territory.After repeated statements by Sham Lal Sharma seeking a separate Jammu state, Javid Rana, minister for forests and environment in the state, was the first to call for the re-merger of Ladakh with J&K.National Conference (NC) president Farooq Abdullah subsequently endorsed the demand. Omar reiterating the same position signals a clear shift in the NC’s stance on the UT of Ladakh. So far, the party was largely focused on the restoration of statehood to J&K.NC’s organisational footprint in Ladakh, particularly in Kargil, remains significant. Ladakh MP Mohmad Haneefa, a former Kargil district president of the NC, won the parliamentary election with the NC’s support and is close to the party. The Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council (LAHDC), Kargil, is currently run by the NC, with senior party leader Dr Mohd Jaffer Akhoo serving as its chief executive councillor.","J&K CM Omar Abdullah said Ladakh should be re-merged with the state.

'Only Miyas are evicted': Himanta Biswa Sarma dismisses charges of targeting indigenous Assamese,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/only-miyas-are-evicted-himanta-biswa-sarma-dismisses-charges-of-targeting-indigenous-assamese/articleshow/127477806.cms,"Himanta Biswa Sarma (ANI image)

NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Sunday claimed that eviction drives in the state have targeted only “Miyas”, a term used for Bengali-speaking Muslims and not indigenous Assamese people. He also accused opposition parties, particularly the Congress of appeasing the community ahead of the Assembly elections.Addressing reporters, Sarma rejected reports of a proposed eviction drive in the hills surrounding Guwahati. He asserted that no eviction would take place in the area till the elections, which are due in the first half of this year.Explaining his position, the chief minister said, “Only Miyas are evicted in Assam. How can Assamese people be evicted,” dismissing concerns over alleged anti-encroachment action in the Guwahati hills.The term ‘Miya’ has traditionally been used as a reference to Bengali-speaking Muslims in Assam, who are often labelled by non-Bengali-speaking groups as Bangladeshi immigrants. In recent years, sections of the community have reclaimed the term as an assertion of identity.“Till election, when not a single eviction will happen, then people residing in the hills will understand that it was the media which gave them tension,” Sarma added.Highlighting the BJP-led government’s record, Sarma said that his party has been in power for nearly a decade and questioned claims of selective evictions.“The BJP has been in power in the state for 10 years now. Where has eviction been carried out in Guwahati hills?” he asked. The Assanm CM added that the government was instead working to grant land rights to people living in the hills without charging any premium.However, he maintained that eviction notices would be served to any Miya residing in the hills, but not to Assamese people.Launching a sharp attack on the Congress, Sarma accused the party of focusing solely on Bengali-speaking Muslims.Referring to applications for Assembly tickets, he said, “The Congress has said that it has received 750 applications from prospective candidates seeking party ticket. But what they didn't say is that 600 of these applicants are Miyas. Only about 120-130 applicants are Hindus.”Using sarcasm, he added, “There has been a ‘Miya ujan’ in Rajib Bhawan,” alleging that the Congress state headquarters was being swamped by people from the community.Sarma further claimed that the Congress posed a threat to Assam’s social fabric. “The Congress party has become a threat to our religion, culture, and the more convincingly we defeat them, the more we can save our state and ‘jati’,” he said. Sarma also alleged that the opposition parties would unite in the elections “for the sake of the Miyas”.The chief minister also said details of alleged Pakistan links involving Assam Congress president and Lok Sabha MP Gaurav Gogoi would be made public soon. “I want to reveal it by January 31. But since there is the Union Budget on February 1, there might be a delay by a day or two,” he said.The BJP and Sarma have been targeting Gogoi over allegations related to his wife’s purported links with Pakistan’s intelligence agency, the ISI.The Assam government had earlier constituted a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe alleged interference by Pakistani national Ali Tauqeer Sheikh, who was claimed to have connections with Gogoi’s British wife, Elizabeth Colburn.The SIT submitted its report to Sarma, who also holds the Home portfolio, on September 10, the date which was initially set by the chief minister to present evidence backing his allegations against Gogoi.","Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma claims that eviction drives in the state have targeted only ‘Miyas’, a term used for Bengali-speaking Muslims.

Amit Shah Confident BJP Will Form Government In Kerala In 2026, Vote Share Climbing

NEW DELHI: Actor-turned-politician and Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) chief Vijay on Sunday said that his party has the strength and resolve to defeat “evil” and “corrupt” political forces in Tamil Nadu ahead of the 2026 Assembly elections.Addressing party workers at a meeting in Mahabalipuram near Chennai, Vijay said that the TVK party alone had the courage to challenge both the ruling and opposition forces.“Only TVK has the guts and the attitude to take on the ‘evil force’ (DMK) that is ruling now and the ‘corrupt force’ (AIADMK) that ruled earlier. Whether it is this evil force or that corrupt force, both should not rule Tamil Nadu,” he said. The TVK president has clearly positioned the party as a clear alternative to the state’s two dominant Dravidian parties.During the event, Vijay formally unveiled TVK’s party symbol, the whistle and blew it on stage, drawing loud cheers from supporters.Vijay framed the upcoming Assembly polls as a decisive fight for democracy rather than a routine electoral contest.“2026 polls not just an election, but a democratic battle. What is going to happen now is not just an election; it is a democratic battle. You are the commanders who are going to lead this democratic battle,” he told party cadres.Targeting both parties over their political alignments, Vijay accused them of yielding ground to the BJP.“The AIADMK has directly surrendered to the BJP, and the DMK has indirectly surrendered to the BJP. We do not bow down to any pressure. Does this face look like it would succumb to pressure?” he asked.Reflecting on his political journey and public support, the TVK chief said the people’s trust had brought him into politics at the height of his film career. The party was formed in 2024.“For 30 years, these parties underestimated us, but the people gave me this position at the peak of my career. People should have faith not only in me but also in those around me,” he said, urging party workers to remain united and disciplined.Stressing political integrity as TVK’s core principle, Vijay added, “We should not compromise our politics for anything or anyone. Each and every one of you is important to me; you are the frontline warriors. The strength of TVK will win, even if no friendly force is with us.”Describing the purpose of his political entry, he said, “We are here to save the people and protect the soil from anyone who intends to cause harm.”","Actor-turned-politician Vijay says TVK party alone has courage to challenge ruling and opposition forces.

From Karyakarta To Party President: Nitin Nabin Becomes BJP's Youngest-Ever Chief

NEW DELHI: BJP national president Nitin Nabin on Sunday asked party workers in Uttar Pradesh to start preparing for the 2027 Assembly elections, warning against what he called “forces” that appear during polls to divide the country and weaken the Constitution.Nabin was on his first visit to Uttar Pradesh after taking charge as BJP president. Speaking at a gathering in Mathura organised to listen to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Mann Ki Baat programme, he said, ""The 2027 (polls) are approaching. There are forces in the country who are working to divide and weaken (baatne aur kaatne) the nation, and disrespect the Constitution. Such forces resurface whenever elections come, and we must be prepared to fight them politically. ”He made a veiled attack on opposition parties, saying, “Sometimes they are seen praising the Constitution. Those who undermined the Constitution are also roaming freely. Those who only promoted anarchists are also around. We haven’t forgotten that the UP government once ran at gunpoint. Today, if the UP government is functioning, it is because of the people’s votes.”He expressed confidence that the BJP would return to power in Uttar Pradesh after the next Assembly elections, expected to be held early next year.He credited party workers for the BJP’s repeated electoral victories at the Centre and said their long struggle had paid off.“Today, every state in the country is moving on the path of development under Prime Minister Modi’s leadership, with Uttar Pradesh playing a leading role,” he said.Nabin praised Adityanath for “turning Uttar Pradesh into an ‘uttam pradesh’”, saying the state was earlier known as a “bimaru” region marked by poor governance and lawlessness. He also spoke about development and cultural projects in Ayodhya, Varanasi and Mathura.“Undoubtedly, every follower of Sanatan Dharma takes pride in a government that preserves Sanatan traditions and carries them forward,” he said.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath welcomed Nabin on his first visit to the state as BJP president. Nabin travelled from Delhi to Mathura via the Yamuna Expressway, where party workers greeted him.Nabin and Adityanath later visited the Shri Vrindavan Chandrodaya temple run by ISKCON Bengaluru on Vrindavan Marg, where they listened to the prime minister’s Mann Ki Baat address.Addressing the gathering, Adityanath said it was a matter of pride that Nabin chose Mathura, the land of Lord Krishna, for his first visit as BJP chief.","Nabin was on his first visit to Uttar Pradesh after taking charge as BJP president.

Immigrant visa vs non-immigrant visa





The pause of immigrant visas from 75 countries that started from January 21 may add around 50,000 employment-based Green Card quotas in 2027 as family-based Green Card quotas pass on to employment-based the next year if they (family-based) remain unused. This is the only positive takeaway for Green Card applicants from the pause on 75 countries. Immigration experts explained that this happened during Covid also, and as a result, the Priority Dates moved up to 4-5 years.Immigration attorney Emily Neumann said she went through the data of all the countries mentioned on the 75-country list to check how much family-based Green Card quotas they had to calculate how much spillover can be expected next year for employment-based categories. About 67,000 immigrant visas would have been allotted to these 75 countries in the current fiscal year, had the ban not been announced, but as the ban came into effect after the first quarter of this fiscal year (starting from October 1), there would be 50,000 spillover Green Cards if the ban on these 75 countries continue through this fiscal year ending in September 2026.Citing 2024 data, Neumann confirmed that Pakistan had the highest number of family-based Green Card quota (15,000), followed by Bangladesh (8000).Both countries have been put on the immigrant visa ban list.The Trump administration announced a list of 75 countries from which it won't process any immigration visa requests as of now. This ban would be in place until the administration reassesses how much welfare benefits these nationals are using. The list includes: Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Antigua and Barbuda, Armenia, Azerbaijan, the Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belarus, Belize, Bhutan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Colombia, Côte d’Ivoire, Cuba, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Dominica, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Fiji, The Gambia, Georgia, Ghana, Grenada, Guatemala, Guinea, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Jamaica, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, North Macedonia, Moldova, Mongolia, Montenegro, Morocco, Myanmar, Nepal, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Republic of the Congo, Russia, Rwanda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Tunisia, Uganda, Uruguay, Uzbekistan, and Yemen.The ban is only on immigrant visa which is sought by people who want to live permanently in the US.

LUCKNOW: What initially started off as a routine cow slaughter seizure on the city’s outskirts spiralled into a dark psychological thriller—one involving betrayal within marriage, burner phones, fake identities and a meticulously scripted attempt to send a man to jail not once, but twice.The mastermind was the woman, whose arrest was earlier attempted inside the High Court premises. “The motive was personal. To pressure her husband into divorcing her,” said police while tracing the plot to a Jan 14 event when acting on a tip-off, allegedly made to Bajrang Dal, police in Kakori intercepted an online porter vehicle near Durgaganj and found 12 kg of beef.The driver disclosed that the delivery was booked in the name of Wasif, a paper factory owner from Aminabad.While Wasif flatly denied placing any such order, the surveillance checks showed that the OTP used to authenticate the delivery was generated on his mobile number. Then came the twist. CCTV footage from Wasif ’s residence showed that, at the precise moment the OTP was used, he was inside the bathroom, while his phone lay unattended outside.“That single frame changed the direction of the entire investigation,” a senior officer said.Investigators soon uncovered that the beef consignment was deliberately planted to frame Wasif. The probe revealed that his wife allegedly conspired with her lover, Amaan, a Bhopal resident, to execute the plan.“Amaan—using the husband’s identity documents- —booked the online porter from Aminabad to Kakori. The beef was transported from Bhopal, concealed inside a cardboard box, and stealthily loaded onto the vehicle. To ensure swift police interception, Amaan allegedly tipped off Bajrang Dal members under a fake identity of Rahul,” said inspector Satish Chandra Rathore of Kakori police station.On Dec 31, Amaan allegedly travelled to Lucknow, where the duo procured a SIM card registered in the name of a roadside beggar. The SIM was used solely to book the consignment. Police also traced the origins of the relationship. The woman and Amaan connected on Instagram in 2022, and what began as casual chats soon turned into an affair.In Sept last year, nearly 20 kg of beef was recovered from a black Mahindra Thar parked at a multi-level parking facility in Hazratganj. Wasif, the registered owner, was arrested and sent to jail. It later emerged that the beef was allegedly planted inside the vehicle early in the morning while Wasif was away.“Wasif came out of jail quickly that time, but wife wanted him behind bars for a longer period. That was when the second, far more sophisticated conspiracy was put into motion,” inspector Rathore said. Police arrested Amaan, while the role of Wasif ’s wife was firmly established during the investigation. “She will be arrested soon,” the inspector added.","Police in Kakori intercepted an online porter vehicle near Durgaganj and found 12 kg of beef.

CHANDIGARH: A day after the deadly ‘China dor' (a nickname given to glass and metal-coated kite string) claimed the life of a 15-year-old in Ludhiana's Samrala, Punjab Police started asking people riding two-wheelers to wear mufflers and not commute on flyovers. Despite an official ban, the string is brazenly sold in the markets of Punjab.Cops deployed on traffic duty in Amritsar were seen diverting two-wheelers, asking them not to commute on flyovers by citing the ‘China dor'. Punjab Police's ""muffler strategy"" comes when opposition parties in Punjab have started questioning the enforcement of the ban on kite string.On Sunday, Punjab Police, on its official handle, posted a video of cops putting mufflers around the necks of two-wheeler riders. The video came with a text advisory: ""China door (sic) poses a serious risk to 2-wheeler riders. Wear a muffler for neck protection and ride safely.""Amritsar additional deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Amandeep Kaur, when contacted, said, ""This is an initiative of our (traffic wing's) education cell."" She said the mufflers being given free to people were purchased either by police personnel who made contributions or by tying up with some NGO for such initiatives. ""We also make efforts to divert two-wheelers from flyovers to service lanes to prevent riders from sustaining injury from Chinese dor,"" she said.","Cops deployed on traffic duty in Amritsar were seen diverting two-wheelers, asking them not to commute on flyovers.

AHMEDABAD: One Indian was caught at the US border every 20 minutes in 2025, a stark measure of how the American dream continues to pull immigrants through illegal and increasingly dangerous routes despite an aggressive crackdown by Trump govt.US Customs and Border Protection caught 23,830 Indians between Jan and Dec 2025, far below the staggering 85,119 caught in 2024, yet still enough to keep India among the top source countries. Most of those caught were single adults chasing work and wages. Yet enforcement agencies flagged a darker trend: a small but troubling flow of unaccompanied children. Nearly four years after the Jan 2022 Dingucha tragedy, when four members of a family from Gandhinagar froze to death while crossing from Canada into the US, children continue to be found abandoned near borders. The 2025 figures underscore a central paradox: enforcement has reduced numbers, but not the urge to try. For thousands, the promise of America still outweighs walls, patrols and peril.US border officials link the drop to stepped-up surveillance, policy shifts under President Donald Trump and a sweeping enforcement drive by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Smuggling corridors have narrowed, patrols intensified and penalties sharpened.Still, attempts continue.""The data shows deterrence, not elimination,"" said experts tracking migration flows. They point to the enduring economic and social pull of the US, paired with smuggling networks that quickly rewire routes when pressure mounts.Indian agencies monitoring illegal immigration, particularly from Gujarat, echo that assessment. ""There is a massive decrease due to stricter US policies and a massive crackdown by agencies including ICE,"" said a senior officer. ""But the numbers are still there because the aspiration of settling in the US, especially among Gujaratis, continues.""Mexico remains a key pathway, but 2025 marked a visible shift north. More Indians were intercepted along the Canada-US border, reflecting how smugglers are abandoning heavily policed Latin American corridors for riskier alternatives.""Routes via Mexico and Canada through hubs like Dubai and Istanbul were the main illegal channels. These routes are now heavily hampered,"" the officer said. ""People who want to illegally enter the US are still trying through newer, riskier paths.""","One Indian was caught at the US border every 20 minutes in 2025.

INDORE : A 75-year-old retired teacher who led protests against filthy drinking water in Indore’s Bhagiratrhpura died on Sunday, the third such death in four days coinciding with an apparent mismatch between official casualty counts of the tragedy in the past month and govt compensation cheques.While Rajaram Bourasi’s family and residents attributed his death to contaminated water, officials cited “co-morbidities” such as high blood pressure and diabetes as the cause. His death fuelled fresh panic and a fierce political row in BJP-governed MP, with opposition Congress accusing the govt of “poisoning citizens”. “The negligence, corruption, and arrogance of the BJP govt claimed the lives of 28 innocent people by serving them poisonous water. @drmohanyadav51 (Dr Mohan Yadav), what was the crime of these 28 people that your govt gave them poison in their water?” state Congress president Jitu Patwari wrote on X, referring to chief minister Mohan Yadav.",Rajaram Bourasi’s family and residents attributed his death to contaminated water.

DEHRADUN: A booth level officer (BLO) from Dehradun's Raipur was allegedly duped of Rs 1.5 lakh by cybercriminals posing as Election Commission (EC) officials, amid the ongoing preparations for the upcoming Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Uttarakhand. The woman told police that the caller claimed her work would be evaluated before the exercise began in the state.Inspector Pradeep Kumar Rana said the 56-year-old complainant received a call from an unknown number on Jan 9. ""The caller introduced himself as an EC official and said they wanted to assess her performance as a BLO ahead of the upcoming SIR. He then asked her to share a code that she would be receiving in a while. Trusting them to be officials of EC, she shared the code,"" Rana said. Soon after, the SIM card on her phone was deactivated and remains so till date, inspector Rana added.Initially, the woman assumed it was a technical issue and did not suspect foul play. ""A few days later, when she visited her bank, she found that around Rs 1.5 lakh had been transferred from her account in multiple transactions between Jan 15 and 17,"" Rana said. It was only then that she realised she had been duped by cybercriminals and lodged a complaint on Saturday.

NEW DELHI: Celebrations marking the 77th Republic Day at Kartavya Path on Monday will centre on the theme of the 150th anniversary of the national song Vande Mataram , a timeless mantra that awakened the spirit of Swadeshi, self-reliance and freedom in India’s national consciousness. This year, Kartavya Path, stretching from Rashtrapati Bhavan to the National War Memorial, has been elaborately decorated for the occasion. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced a year-long commemoration of the 150th anniversary of the national song, culminating on November 7, 2025, according to news agency ANI.According to a release from the Ministry of Defence, the celebrations will present an extraordinary blend of the 150-year legacy of Vande Mataram, the country’s unprecedented developmental progress, robust military strength, vibrant cultural diversity and active participation from citizens across all walks of life.A distinguished series of paintings created by Tejendra Kumar Mitra in 1923, illustrating the verses of Vande Mataram and published in the Bande Mataram Album (1923), is being displayed as view-cutters along Kartavya Path.As many as 30 tableaux—17 from States and Union Territories and 13 from Ministries, Departments and Services—will roll down Kartavya Path under the broad themes of ‘Swatantrata ka Mantra: Vande Mataram’ and ‘Samriddhi ka Mantra: Aatmanirbhar Bharat’.The tableaux will showcase a unique blend of the 150-year journey of the national song and the nation’s rapid progress driven by growing self-reliance across sectors, infused with rich and vibrant cultural diversity.Adopted as India’s National Song by the Constituent Assembly in 1950, Vande Mataram was initially composed independently and later included in Bankim Chandra Chatterjee’s novel Anandamath, published in 1882. It was first sung by Rabindranath Tagore at the 1896 Congress session in Calcutta and was set to music by him.Vande Mataram, which translates to “Mother, I Bow to Thee,” has inspired generations of freedom fighters and nation builders and remains a lasting emblem of India’s national identity and collective spirit. It has become an integral part of the nation’s civilisational, political and cultural consciousness.Popularised during the Swadeshi and anti-partition movements, the song soon transcended regional boundaries to emerge as an anthem of national awakening. From Bengal to Bombay and the plains of Punjab, its refrain echoed as a symbol of resistance against colonial rule. British efforts to suppress its rendition only heightened its patriotic significance, transforming it into a moral force that united people across caste, creed and language. Leaders, students and revolutionaries drew strength from its verses, reciting it at political gatherings, demonstrations and even before imprisonment.“Vande Mataram” emerged as the rallying cry of Indian nationalism in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. During the turbulent days of 1905, amid the anti-partition and Swadeshi movement in Bengal, the appeal of the song and slogan became especially powerful. At the Varanasi session of the Indian National Congress that year, Vande Mataram was adopted for all-India occasions.Parliament marked 150 years of the national song in December 2025 with special discussions in both Houses, initiated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The debates traced the song’s history and included references to the 1937 Congress decision to adopt only its first two stanzas. The government has also launched initiatives nationwide to connect the youth with the song’s original spirit.At the conclusion of the Republic Day parade, a banner bearing ‘Vandemataram’ will be unveiled, accompanied by the release of rubber balloons, marking a fitting tribute to the enduring spirit of the nation.","Kartavya Path, stretching from Rashtrapati Bhavan to the National War Memorial, has been elaborately decorated for the occasion.

JHANSI: A 13-year-old boy, who had been kidnapped, was found dead in Uttar Pradesh’s Chitrakoot district Friday, his body stuffed inside a suitcase. Police shot his two kidnappers when they allegedly tried to escape during the recovery of the crime weapon; one of them died on the way to hospital.Ayush Kesarwani, a Class 7 student and resident of Bangar area, went missing Thursday evening. Around 8.30pm, his father Ashok, a cloth merchant, received a call from an unknown number demanding Rs 40 lakh ransom.Police said the accused, Irfan (28) and Kallu (22), had called Ashok using a cellphone stolen from a relative. Both were natives of Prayagraj who had relocated a year ago; they ran a shop making tin boxes and trunks.They had been Ashok’s tenants until he kicked them out in Sept last year for alleged shady behaviour. Apparently nursing agrudge, the duo moved into a nearby house and lured Ayush to their accommodation.A distraught Ashok alerted cops, and police personnel from around 10 police stations, along with SOG and SWAT teams, carried out a frantic search. Technical surveillance teams traced the cellphone used to make the ransom call and zeroed in on the accused before they could switch the device off, destroy evidence, or flee.After an overnight search, the kidnappers were caught early Friday. They confessed to having murdered Ayush, stuffing his body in a suitcase and burying it near his residence.“The accused were taken to a nearby jungle where the stolen cellphone was recovered. They constantly tried to mislead us about the body’s location. In between, they snatched the gun from police and opened fire. In retaliatory firing, both were injured. When they were taken to the hospital, Kallu was declared dead, while Irfan was referred to a higher centre in Prayagraj,” Chitrakoot SP Arun Kumar Singh said.Kallu had a murder case and two other cases registered in the past in Prayagraj Commissionerate.The crime sparked protests in the area, with thousands of angry residents staging a dharna, blocking the national highway for hours and raising slogans demanding harsh punishment for the accused, including ‘bulldozer justice’. The protesters demanded compensation and a govt job for the kin of the deceased, along with an assurance that they would not be booked for blocking the NH.Senior police and administrative officials reached the spot and appealed to the agitators to vacate the area, assuring them of proper action.","Ayush Kesarwani, a Class 7 student and resident of Bangar area, went missing Thursday evening.

Periodic table meets Shakespeare: Hemchandracharya North Gujarat University (HNGU) appoints chemistry professor as HOD of English,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/periodic-table-meets-shakespeare-univ-appoints-chemistry-prof-hod-of-eng/articleshow/127322089.cms,"File Photo Used For Representative Purpose Only







AHMEDABAD: The decision of Hemchandracharya North Gujarat University (HNGU) to appoint a chemistry professor as the in-charge head of its English department ended up in combustion triggering multiple litigations and a fuming court questioning the university--how a science teacher would address academic concerns of English literature students?The HNGU was forced to reverse the decision even as the court allowed aggrieved party to knock on appropriate doors for further justice.The issue arose after the retirement of former HOD of English, Adesh Pal, in June last year, when the university appointed Kokilaben Parmar, a faculty member in the chemistry department, as in-charge HOD of English. The appointment was challenged by Hetal Patel, a faculty member in the English department, who approached the Education Tribunal.HNGU's advocate, Meet Shah, defended the university's decision, submitting that the seniority of faculty members in the English department was yet to be ascertained. He said Parmar was tasked to look after only administrative affairs of the department. He also questioned Patel's application in the tribunal, arguing it was not a service matter but only the university's administrative decision for a temporary arrangement.On Oct 10, 2025, the tribunal stayed HNGU's decision to appoint a chemistry faculty member as English HOD. Parmar then approached the high court, challenging the stay on the grounds that she was not heard by the tribunal before it stayed her appointment as HOD of English.A week later, the high court stayed the tribunal's order.The university also challenged the tribunal's decision, citing the tribunal's jurisdiction to entertain Patel's application, which it said was not a service matter. Patel's counsel submitted that the university ignored the rules and neglected her in appointing the chemistry faculty member as in-charge HOD.During a hearing on Tuesday, Justice Nirzar Desai questioned the university on how chemistry could address academic concerns of a student of English literature. The university could not reply to the court's query, but said Parmar's role was restricted to administrative decisions only. However, the court continued to question how an HOD not well versed in the subject could help a student.On Friday, the university produced a draft order to replace the chemistry teacher with a faculty member of the English department, Tapal Chakrabarty. The university clarified that it could not replace Parmar as in-charge HOD with somebody else due to the high court's stay order. Patel objected to the proposal as well, citing the rules of appointment and seniority.Following HNGU's new decision, Parmar and the university withdrew their petitions. On Patel's grievance regarding Chakrabarty as the new choice, the High Court said, ""…it shall be open for respondent No. 3, Ms. Patel, to challenge the same before the appropriate authority in accordance with law.""","Hemchandracharya North Gujarat University (HNGU) appointed a chemistry professor as the in-charge head of its English department.

Impact marks were found on a plywood cabinet and walls. Nobody was injured.After the police were informed, they studied CCTV footage but nobody was found entering or leaving the society. The guard said he hadn't sounds of gunfire. Police then took the help of forensic experts to find out what type of firearm did the bullets belong to. They then found out the firing range of such a weapon and checked which of the residents from the area had registered similar weapons.The police team, supervised by additional commissioner Paramjeet Dahiya and DCP Dikshitkumar Gedam, and comprising senior inspector Sanjay Chavan and inspector Sachin Patil took Khan into custody after confirming that the bullets came from his 7.65 mm Mauser. Police said Khan has a prior crime record.Around 1 pm on Saturday, Khan was produced before a magistrate court at Bandra and remanded to police custody till Jan 27. Adv Mishra argued that Khan had no intention for firing. ""The actor is not acquainted with either of the people (in whose houses the bullets were found). He has a licensed pistol that he has kept at home for self-defence,"" Adv Mishra said. The lawyer added that the range of a pistol is 20 metres but the bullets were found 400 metres away.Between Khan's bungalow and Nalanda society, there are mangroves, roads and an under-construction structure.Adv Mishra has also claimed that the actor was not served a notice, as required under Bhartiya Nagrik Suraksha Sanhita, nor were the grounds of arrest disclosed to him.",Police recovered a German-made pistol and 21 rounds from the actor's bungalow in Versova.

PRAYAGRAJ: Observing that western ideas influence youth to get into live-in relationships and rape FIRs are lodged when such relations fail, the Allahabad high court has overturned a life sentence given to a man for allegedly kidnapping and sexually assaulting a minor girl, who was later found to be an adult.The court said that since the laws are in favour of women, men get convicted relying upon the laws which were made when the concept of live-in was nowhere in existence.Allowing a criminal appeal filed by one Chandresh, a division bench comprising Justices Siddharth and Prashant Mishra on Jan 8 observed that there is an increasing tendency among the youth to live together without the solemnization of marriage under the influence of western ideas and the concept of live-in. When such relations fail, FIRs are lodged, the bench said.The HC set aside the judgment and order of conviction and sentence, including life imprisonment given to Chandresh in March 2024 by a special judge, Pocso Act, Maharajganj. The court also noted that the school records the prosecution relied on lacked any documentary foundation under the Juvenile Justice Rules. Her bone test later revealed her to be a major.The court also took into account the girl’s conduct as she admitted in her testimony that she left her house willingly and travelled with the appellant by public transport to Gorakhpur and then to Bangalore. The court held that the conviction under sections 363 (kidnapping) and 366 (abduction for marriage) of IPC was absolutely unwarranted as per the law as the girl was a major and had eloped of her own free will.The court further set aside the conviction under section 3(2)(V) of the SC/ST Act, noting it is not an independent provision and applies only where the accused is punished with imprisonment of 10 years or more under the IPC. Thus, concluding that trial court had not properly considered the evidence on record, the HC set aside the conviction and allowed the convict’s appeal.","Allahabad high court overturned a life sentence given to a man for allegedly kidnapping and sexually assaulting a minor girl.

‘Rules No Longer Protect': Canada's Carney Blasts Trump Tariffs Over Greenland | FULL SPEECH

US President Donald Trump on Saturday warned Canada and its Prime Minister Mark Carney over making any deals with China. Refering to Carney as ""governor"", he said that US will impose 100 per cent tariffs if Canada makes any such deals.""If Governor Carney thinks he is going to make Canada a “Drop Off Port” for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken,"" said Trump on Truth Social.Further continuing his jab, he added, ""China will eat Canada alive, completely devour it, including the destruction of their businesses, social fabric, and general way of life. If Canada makes a deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100% Tariff against all Canadian goods and products coming into the USA. Thank you for your attention to this matter!""Earlier, Trump launched a fresh attack on Canada, accusing Ottawa of opposing his proposed “Golden Dome” missile defence system over Greenland while choosing to deepen economic ties with China.“Canada is against The Golden Dome being built over Greenland, even though The Golden Dome would protect Canada,"" he had said, adding, “Instead, they voted in favor of doing business with China, who will ‘eat them up’ within the first year!""Trump’s remarks came after Carney’s visit to Beijing, where he sought to revive economic engagement with China, Canada’s second-largest trading partner after the US. Carney also sharply criticised the US and Western allies during his address at the World Economic Forum in Davos.The China visit led to an agreement to reduce tariffs on select Canadian agricultural exports and introduce quotas on Chinese electric vehicles entering the Canadian market. The understanding could also pave the way for increased Chinese investment in Canada. Marking the first visit by a Canadian leader to China in nearly a decade, the trip included discussions that both sides described as part of a shifting global landscape, with Chinese Premier Xi Jinping welcoming what he called a “turnaround” in bilateral ties.Speaking about the agreement earlier, Carney appeared to reference ongoing US tariff tensions, noting that Canada’s recent dealings with China had been more “predictable” and describing talks with Beijing as “realistic and respectful.”","US President Donald Trump on Saturday warned Canada and its Prime Minister Mark Carney over making any deals with China.
