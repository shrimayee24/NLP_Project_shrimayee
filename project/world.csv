‘Very Bleak Message To World’: South Africa Envoy Condemns Delhi Blast And Seeks Joint Action

NEW DELHI: Dr Umer Un Nabi, the bomber behind the Nov 10 blast near Red Fort, had set up a laboratory at his house near the Al-Falah University in Faridabad, where he would test various kinds of explosives and try out the bomb-making techniques shared with him by his Pakistani handlers via Telegram.Sources close to the investigation told TOI that he possibly put together the ""loosely assembled"" improvised explosive device (IED) responsible for the Red Fort car blast at this home laboratory.The laboratory with all the testing equipment and traces of various kinds of explosives was unearthed during the raid on Umer's house. The information on Dr Umer's house as well as the IED testing and bomb making laboratory installed there is said to have come during the questioning of the arrested doctors of the Faridabad-based Jaish module, most likely Muzammil Ganaie.As reported by TOI on Friday, Dr Umer and two other doctors accused in the ‘white collar' terror case – Dr Muzammil and Dr Adeel Rather – were directly in touch with three Pakistani Jaish handlers Faisal, Hashim and Ukasha via encrypted messaging platform, Telegram.The handlers were passing on instructions, radicalisation videos and bomb-making DIY videos to the trio via Telegram chat. Agencies believe that Dr Umer was the bomb-making expert among the three, which is why he had set up a laboratory at his home.He would work there, mostly alone, to put together the IEDs as per instructions in the DIY videos and also test the chemicals to be employed as explosives and the triggering mechanisms to maximise the potency of the bomb being assembled.Two major batches of explosives, weighing 358 kg and 2,563 kg each, were recovered from two separate houses in Faridabad during raids between Nov 8 and 10. Indicating that the bombs were yet to be assembled, the explosives were found packed in suitcases and bags, with no metal pieces, usually used as shrapnel to maximise injury, being found.Sources said a possible link between the Delhi car blast, which agencies believe was triggered by accident, and the ""accidental"" explosion at Nowg-am police station on Friday night, may be examined.","Dr Umer Un Nabi, the bomber behind the Nov 10 blast near Red Fort, had set up a laboratory at his house near the Al-Falah University in Faridabad.

BENGALURU: A routine temple visit turned costly for a software engineer whose shoes, worth Rs 16,000, were stolen from outside Shri Ganesha Temple in Banashankari III Stage, south Bengaluru.When cops were initially reluctant to file an FIR for footwear theft, the techie insisted they do so because he claimed it's a common occurrence outside temples.The Girinagar resident told police his shoes, bought just six months back, were stolen between 7.20pm and 7.25pm on Nov 6. Wearing his branded shoes (Asics), the complainant visited the temple on his motorcycle. He parked his bike and left his shoes in front of the temple where other devotees had left their footwear.After offering prayers, he walked out of the temple within five minutes only to find his shoes missing. He then approached the temple management and priest. ""I learned that it was a common problem in the temple. The thieves have not even spared the priest. His slippers were stolen twice in the past. Many devotees too shared incidents of losing their footwear. But none of them had filed a complaint with police. I didn't want to ignore such incidents,"" the complainant told TOI.The CCTV camera installed at the temple entrance caught the thief walking barefoot, posing as a devotee, and leaving with the complainant's shoes.A couple of footwear thieves were caught in the past, and they revealed that they usually sold the stolen footwear for Rs 20 to Rs 50 to buy liquor.""If small thefts are ignored, the same person will commit bigger crimes, so they should be taught a lesson and reformed,"" said the complainant.A senior police officer said a case has been registered under the BNS section 303 (theft), CCTV footage have been collected and efforts are on to nab the thief.","Software engineer's shoes, worth Rs 16,000, were stolen from outside Shri Ganesha Temple.

Chilling Terror Attack Masterplan: How Medical Professionals Built A 5-Step Nationwide Bombing Plot





FARIDABAD: Umar Un Nabi, the doctor at the heart of the Delhi terror plot who was in the i20 that blew up outside Red Fort metro station on Nov 10, killing 13 lives, hid in Hidayat Colony in Nuh for 10 days before the incident, investigators have found.Umar, a professor of medicine at Faridabad-based Al-Falah University, fled the campus after his colleague Dr Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie was arrested by Jammu & Kashmir Police on Oct 30.Also read: ‘Mother of Satan’ in Delhi car blast? Sensing the terror plot – suspected to have been planned by Umar and Muzammil over two years – unravelling, Umar looked for a hideout and, according to investigators, found one in Hidayat Colony where an electrician associated with the university helped him rent a room. Sources said the owner of the house has been detained for questioning.Police and National Investigation Agency are also tracking a hawala network operating in the Mewat region that Umar and the radicalised doctors’ module used for money transfers. Two hawala operators’ financial trails are being investigated, sources said. The fresh leads triggered nightlong raids in Nuh, Faridabad and other places.Teams also conducted searches of quarters where doctors associated with Umar and Muzammil live inside the university and also rooms of students and interns who worked with the two doctors as well as Dr SHAHIN Shaheed, the third accused from Al-Falah arrested in the probe.Soon after the explosion at Srinagar’s Nowgam police station on Friday night, meanwhile, a massive search and combing operation was undertaken at Al-Falah University after midnight. Sources said a convoy of more than 30 police and NaTIONAL Security Guard vehicles reached Al-Falah University. They also conducted a sweep of surrounding areas.J&K Police clarified on Saturday the Nowgam explosion was accidental. Explosive substances allegedly procured by Umar and Muzammil and seized from Faridabad last Sunday were taken to Nowgam.A restaurant owner near the university said the scale of the convoy was unlike anything he had seen before. “They were all over the road. People were being detained. Someone from our village was also taken but later released after it turned out to be a misidentification,” he said.On Saturday morning, Faridabad police’s crime branch deployed its personnel at the university entrance to record details of anyone entering the campus, even security personnel. A police officer said seniors had issued clear instructions to maintain detailed logs to ensure no unauthorised person enters the campus posing as a security officer.Teams from UP Police and the Lucknow NIA unit, including an SP-rank officer, also visited the Al-Falah campus on Saturday. Amid a heightened threat perception, Faridabad police launched extensive checks across the district. According to police spokesperson Yashpal, teams inspected around 140 places of worship, 1,700 tenants, 40 fertilizer–seed shops and nearly 200 guest houses .","Umar, a professor of medicine at Faridabad-based Al-Falah University, fled the campus after his colleague Dr Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie was arrested by Jammu & Kashmir Police on Oct 30.

Delhi Police file new FIR; uncovers 'deeper conspiracy' in Red Fort car blast; doctor module used ‘spycraft’ tactics,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-car-blast-probe-intensifies-fir-uncovers-deeper-conspiracy-doctor-module-used-spycraft-tactics/articleshow/125340660.cms,"Delhi Blast: Security Forces Demolish House of Red Fort Bombing Accused Umar Nabi in Pulwama





NEW DELHI: The special cell of Delhi Police has filed an FIR to probe what it claimed was a deeper conspiracy in connection with the car blast near Red Fort.The first FIR registered under UAPA was transferred to NIA. The special cell has invoked sections of criminal conspiracy in this FIR and will reportedly make arrests soon.The blast was so powerful that the ground nearby shook, intelligence sources said on Friday, citing fresh CCTV footage of underground areas of Red Fort metro station. It shows the entire station experiencing a significant tremor causing goods on a cart to shake and rattle. The footage also reveals widespread chaos as panic-stricken commuters run for safety.Explosive experts who picked up samples from the spot are yet to give their report detailing the nature of the bomb, though police maintain Umar Un Nabi, who was behind the wheel when the car blew up, possibly used military grade explosives.Sleuths examined new CCTV footage of the route taken by Umar. “While travelling on Delhi-Mumbai Expressway, he stopped near a dhaba but didn’t eat anything and slept in his car, the footage shows.On the day of the explosion, Umar stopped at a small shop in Wazirpur and had tea. He was there for around 15 minutes but didn’t talk to anyone,” said a cop.Meanwhile, two doctors were detained for questioning from Haryana’s Nuh district on Thursday night, sources said. One of them pursued an MBBS course from China and recently finished an internship at Al-Falah University. Police informed his family that he was detained for questioning after he allegedly talked to some terror suspects.Suspicious numbers were found on his mobile phone, the cops claimed. The person recently appeared for a job interview at a prestigious medical institution in south Delhi. The other doctor also interned at Al-Falah.Haryana’s Nuh district has come under the radar of intel agencies following the blast. In the last week, five suspects — three MBBS doctors, a fertiliser vendor, and an imam — were taken into custody from the area. Multiple raids have been conducted in the district, which was earlier known as Mewat.Sources in the agencies suggest ammonium nitrate, which could have been used in the explosion, was purchased from Nuh. This suspicion is fuelled by reports that past locations of Umar and his doctor colleague, Muzammil, have been traced to Mewat on multiple occasions.The probe has revealed members of the ‘doctor module’ would draft emails in a shared account without sending them. The recipient would log in, read the draft and delete it to avoid leaving digital evidence. This method is generally used in spycraft. The module also used the Threema app, which operates without phone numbers or email IDs, and possibly created a private server to share maps and locations.","The first FIR registered under UAPA was transferred to NIA.

SRINAGAR/NEW DELHI: An “accidental explosion” at Nowgam police station late Friday night, caused by substances seized during raids in an NCR city and transported to Kashmir by police, killed 9 people and injured 30.J&K DGP Nalin Prabhat said at a press briefing in Srinagar on Saturday morning a huge cache of explosive substances, chemicals and reagents were recovered from Faridabad on Nov 9 and 10, during the investigation of an interstate terror module.“The recovery was transported and kept securely in the open area of the police station (Nowgam),” Prabhat said, adding, “As part of prescribed procedure, samples of the recovery had to be forwarded for further forensic and chemical examination. On account of the voluminous and sensitive nature of the recovery, it was being handled with utmost caution. However … an accidental explosion took place at about 11.20 pm on Nov 14. Any other speculation into the cause of this incident is unnecessary.” The DGP didn’t take questions.The Union home ministry, too, said in New Delhi that the Nowgam police station explosion was triggered accidentally as explosives recovered from the recently busted terror module were being handled and sampled by forensic experts and other agencies ahead of their transport to FSL, Jammu.There are SOPs for handling and sampling seized explosives and officials in Delhi said these were followed in Nowgam as police personnel, magisterial staff and forensic experts continued working late into Friday night to complete the sampling. Though protective gear, like bomb suits, is available, forensic teams rarely use them. Officials said an external agent yet to be ascertained but which could be a flying spark from something nearby, may have triggered the explosion, with the cars of teams parked nearby adding to its magnitude.The explosion at the police station, operating from a private house in the heart of Nowgam’s posh Sheikh-ul-Alam Colony, shook large parts of Srinagar and reduced the police station to rubble. Among the nine killed were a Special Investigation Agency officer, three Forensic Science Laboratory personnel, two revenue officials, and a tailor associated with the police station. Thirty others — 27 policemen, two revenue officials and three civilians — were wounded.Nowgam police station had investigated the Jaish-e-Mohammed posters that appeared in Bonpora area of Nowgam on Oct 19, an inquiry that led to the busting of an interstate terror module involving doctors and others.Ruling out any terror angle, J&K DGP Prabhat said the cause of this “unfortunate incident” is being inquired into. L-G Manoj Sinha said govt stands in solidarity with the families, friends, and loved ones of the departed. “All possible assistance is being provided to those affected. I've ordered a probe to ascertain the cause of the accidental explosion,” he added.MHA officials told TOI that around 358 kg of explosives recovered from Faridabad was transported in a Tata 407 goods carrier to Nowgam police station earlier this week as “case property”. As per the law case property, comprising recoveries from all raided locations, must be deposited at the police station where the FIR is registered.“Deeply anguished by the loss of precious lives due to extremely tragic accidental blast at Nowgam Police Station in Srinagar. My condolences to the bereaved families. I pray for speedy recovery of the injured,” the L-G said in a post on X. CM Omar Abdullah extended his “heartfelt condolences” to the bereaved families and prayed for the swift recovery of those injured.Later in the day, when some media channels reported that People's Anti-Fascist Front (PAFF), a JeM proxy declared a “terrorist organisation” by the Union home ministry in 2023, had claimed responsibility for the “attack”, the police issued a quick rebuttal: “The claim of PAFF or any other Pakistani terrorist group is patently false, baseless and mischievous.”J&K police had placed concertina wire at the entrance to Sheikh-ul-Alam Colony on Friday, and policemen carrying AK-47s were allowing people to pass only after thorough checks. The road leading to Nowgam police station, located deep inside the colony, was covered with shattered window panes, twisted tin sheets and other debris as residents stepped out to describe what happened the previous night.“It felt like it was a missile strike,” said a resident living a few hundred metres from the police station. He said he was asleep when a loud bang shook his two-storey house and window panes fell onto his bed. For a moment, he said, he believed a fresh war between India and Pakistan had started. “Then I heard cries, and in the neighbourhood several young girls staying here for studies screamed. It was complete mayhem.”Another resident said he grabbed his child and ran outside after the explosion, seeing policemen fleeing in panic. “One policeman kept saying he was fine, and then blood started coming out of his mouth and he fell down,” he said. Another resident said that when he stepped out and walked towards the police station, he saw a man completely covered in black powder asking for help. “I gave him a cloth to clean himself, and I recognised him as the cook of the police station, who had survived. ”Nowgam police station was housed in a rented building for the past three decades. “I have always seen the police station here. I think in 1997 there was a cylinder blast at the station,” a resident said. He said that over the past few days the police station had seen heavy movement, with several officials visiting regularly station as an “important case was being investigated there”.A labourer who works as a chowkidar in a building near the police station said there was a big blast followed by several smaller explosions that shattered windows and cracked walls in the locality. He said that in the morning he saw policemen recovering some body parts. He said the fire service had arrived within 10 minutes of the explosion and helped douse the flames and save the locality.The police station now lies in complete ruin. Its gate and boundary walls are gone. Several vehicles on the road outside are damaged, their window panes blown out. Inside the compound, charred vehicles lie flipped over by the blast, and the building itself is now a heap of rubble.A young man whose house is adjacent to the police station and separated only by a wall said the blast threw him off his feet and falling window glass injured his eyes and face. He then rushed to the nearby Ujala hospital, across the main road. Those killed in the blast were from different parts of the Valley. Relatives and friends were inconsolable at the wreath-laying ceremony at the police control room, Srinagar.When the body of tailor Mohammad Shafi Parry was brought home in Nowgam on Saturday afternoon, mourning erupted across the area. Locals said he was widely loved and an active social worker in the community.","J&K DGP Nalin Prabhat said at a press briefing in Srinagar on Saturday morning a huge cache of explosive substances, chemicals and reagents were recovered from Faridabad on Nov 9 and 10, during the investigation of an interstate terror module. “The recovery was transported and kept securely in the open area of the police station (Nowgam),” he said.

Rahul meets Kharge to discuss Cong's Bihar poll drubbing



NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi , a day after the NDA’s historic win in Bihar, launched a sharp attack on the Congress, saying dissatisfaction was spreading among senior nationalist leaders who had once worked closely with Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi.Taking a veiled dig at Rahul Gandhi, Prime Minister said that their frustration stemmed from the conduct of what he called the party’s “namdar” leadership. He further accused the opposition of now turning its anger towards institutions instead of accepting the verdict.Addressing a gathering of Bihari residents in Surat, PM Modi said the Congress and its allies had turned to blaming institutions instead of introspecting.“Opposition can't explain poll rout even to their workers and blaming EVMs, EC and electoral rolls' revision,” he said, calling it part of a “habitual” attempt to discredit constitutional bodies.He also pointed to what he described as growing frustration among younger opposition MPs, saying, “When we meet young Congress members or INDIA alliance members in the Parliament, they say, ‘Sir, what can we do? Our careers are coming to an end.We don't even get a chance to speak in Parliament because these people keep saying, ‘Lock Parliament,’ every time.’ They’re unable to answer their own constituencies...”Turning to Bihar, PM Modi praised the state’s voters for delivering a decisive mandate and setting what he described as a global example. He said Bihar’s political clarity had strengthened the NDA while exposing weaknesses in the opposition’s message. “Bihar is famous worldwide today… Bihar’s women and youth formed a combination that strengthened the foundation of politics for decades to come,” he said.He highlighted the 10 per cent vote gap between the NDA and the Mahagathbandhan as evidence of a clear preference for development.He sharply criticised opposition leaders, accusing them of attempting to divide voters. ""For the past two years, these 'jamanati' politicians, who are out on bail, were going around in Bihar giving speeches about casteism… This election in Bihar has completely rejected that poison of casteism. This is a very bright sign for the country."" He also referred to controversies over Waqf properties, saying Bihar’s voters had dismissed what he called “communal poison”.The NDA secured a massive mandate in the Bihar assembly elections winning 202 seats while the Mahagathbandhan secured 35.Meanwhile, the Congress on Saturday questioned the role of the Election Commission in the Bihar poll process as its top leaders, including Rahul Gandhi and party president Mallikarjun Kharge, met in Delhi to assess the party’s poor performance. Gandhi and Kharge were joined by K C Venugopal, Ajay Maken and Bihar in-charge Krishna Allavaru. Sources said the meeting focused on the Congress winning only six of the 61 seats it contested, its second-worst tally in the state since 2010.After the discussions, Venugopal blamed the Election Commission for the outcome, alleging that “the entire poll process is questionable and there is no transparency”. Calling the result “unbelievable for all of us”, he said alliance partners were also “not believing it”. He argued that a “90 per cent plus strike rate for a political party” had never happened in Indian history and said the Congress was collecting data from across Bihar and would present “concrete proof” within one or two weeks.Venugopal said the conduct of electioneering was “completely questionable” and alleged that “the Election Commission is totally one-sided”.",Prime Minister Narendra Modi predicts major Congress split after NDA’s Bihar Win and Warns Allies Of Growing Instability.

NEW DELHI: Jammu & Kashmir National Conference (JKNC) chief Farooq Abdullah addressed India-Pakistan relations on Saturday in light of the blast at Nowgam Police Station which was after the explosion near Red Fort in Delhi. He made claims on Operation Sindoor ""again"" and India-Pakistan relations.The Nowgam incident resulted in nine casualties, 32 injuries and substantial structural damage while the Delhi blast killed 12 people.In his interview with ANI, Abdullah said, ""I hope no such thing (Operation Sindoor) will happen. Nothing came out of it (Operation Sindoor). Our 18 people died. Our borders were compromised. I hope both nations improve their relations. That is the only way. I want to repeat what Vajpayee Ji said, friends can be changed, but neighbours cannot.""Abdullah also called for an extensive independent inquiry into the Nowgam incident today, suggesting that improper handling of explosives potentially led to the incident that resulted in nine fatalities and damage to residential buildings.In his earlier Srinagar interview with ANI, the former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister expressed concern about the handling of explosive materials by local authorities, emphasising the importance of consulting specialists.""This is our mistake, those who understand this explosive better, we should have talked to them first about how to deal with it instead of trying to handle it ourselves, you saw the result, nine people lost their lives. So much damage was caused to the houses there,"" he had said.Abdullah discussed the impact of the Nowgam incident in relation to the current climate of distrust towards Kashmiri residents across the nation following the Delhi blast. ""We haven't yet come out of the crisis in Delhi where fingers are being pointed at every Kashmiri. When will that day come when they will accept that we are Indians and we are not responsible for this, ask those who are responsible why these doctors had to take this path? What was the reason?"" he commented.The JKNC leader emphasised the need for accountability, noting that the circumstances of the blast, including the suspected involvement of medical professionals, require detailed investigation. ""There is a need for a thorough investigation and study of this,"" he stated, urging authorities to determine responsibility and implement preventive measures.The Jammu and Kashmir Police are currently investigating the Nowgam explosion, which occurred while handling an explosive device within the police station.","Jammu & Kashmir National Conference (JKNC) chief Farooq Abdullah addressed India-Pakistan relations on Saturday in light of the blast at Nowgam Police Station.

PM Modi Predicts Major Congress Split After NDA’s Bihar Win And Warns Allies Of Growing Instability

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday took a swipe at Tejashwi Yadav without naming him, recalling the RJD leader’s earlier remark on what would happen to the Waqf Amendment Act if the opposition Mahagathbandhan alliance came to power in Bihar.PM Modi’s comments came a day after the Mahagathbandhan suffered a heavy defeat in the Bihar assembly elections , with the ruling NDA sweeping the state. Tejashwi Yadav was the opposition alliance’s chief ministerial candidate.“In Bihar, public land was frequently encroached upon and converted into Waqf property. We have seen a similar situation in Tamil Nadu, where even centuries-old villages were declared as Waqf,” the prime minister said in Surat, in his home state of Gujarat, while addressing members of the Bihar community.He added that encroachments of public land by the Waqf Board were the reason the government introduced reforms to the Waqf law.“A leader who is now out on bail, along with his allies, would tear up copies of the law and claim they would never allow it in Bihar. But the people of Bihar rejected this communal poison completely and chose the path of development,” PM Modi said, referring to Tejashwi Yadav, who — along with members of his family — is out on bail in the alleged land-for-jobs money laundering case.At a public rally in the Muslim-dominated Katihar district on October 26, Yadav had vowed that if the Mahagathbandhan came to power, the Waqf Amendment Act would be “thrown into the dustbin.”The RJD leader's comments came a day after a controversy triggered by party MLA Qari Sohaib, who had declared that the legislation would be “torn apart” if Tejashwi became chief minister.The Waqf (Amendment) Act was passed by Parliament in April. While the government described the law as a step toward transparency and an instrument to empower backward Muslims and women in the community, the opposition argued that it infringes upon the rights of Muslims.On September 15, the Supreme Court, stayed a few key provisions of the law while upholding its constitutionality.",PM Modi's comments came a day after the Mahagathbandhan suffered a heavy defeat in the Bihar assembly elections.

NEW DELHI: Two days after the deadly car blast near Delhi’s Red Fort, new revelations from the family of arrested doctor Shaheen Sayeed have added a personal dimension to the ongoing terror investigation.Speaking to PTI in Lucknow, Mohammad Shoaib, Shaheen’s elder brother, has said the family is in “complete disbelief” over her alleged link to terrorist activities. He added that they were still struggling to come to terms with the accusations.He confirmed that the police and Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) officials had searched their home but behaved respectfully.“They searched the house and asked questions normally, the same way you are asking me now,” Shoaib said.“Neither my father nor I were treated harshly. There was no pressure or force used to make us say anything. They only asked about when my sister stopped visiting us.”Shoaib revealed that the family had not been in contact with Shaheen for the past four years. However, their parents occasionally called to check on her well-being.“We have had no contact. It’s been four years since we last spoke. Parents will naturally call their children to ask how they are doing.I am her elder brother, of course, I would also worry about her. Isn’t that normal?” he said.When asked if he had ever visited her residence near IIM Road in Lucknow, Shoaib replied: “No, I have never gone there. I only knew that she has a house somewhere along the IIM Road. I don’t even know the exact location.”He said there was never any reason to suspect her of wrongdoing.“Even when she was studying medicine, there was never any sign of her being involved in anything suspicious. I still don’t believe these allegations. As I have said before, I simply cannot believe it,” he said.Shaheen’s former husband, Dr Zafar Hayat, who lives in Kanpur, also expressed shock over her alleged role in the case. He said he learned about her arrest only a day earlier.Hayat and Shaheen married in November 2003 and got divorced in 2012. Both were doctors, and he recalled her as “a loving mother and caring person.”“Our divorce took place towards the end of 2012. I am not sure what was on her mind that led to it. There was never any dispute or quarrel between us. She was a loving and caring person,” he said.“I never had any inkling that she could be involved in such activities. She was deeply attached to her family and children, loved them immensely and took care of their studies,” Hayat added.Recalling their marriage, he said: “I had never seen her in a burqa. She only wore it during the wedding rituals. I have no idea about her alleged involvement in any terror activities now being reported. Our divorce happened long ago, in 2012, and if she got involved in something later, I know nothing about it.”He also remembered a conversation they once had about settling abroad.Dr Hayat recalled that Shaheen had once suggested settling in Australia or Europe for better pay and quality of life; however, he told her that they already had good jobs and a comfortable life in India, surrounded by family and friends.Hayat said he was unaware that Shaheen had returned to India and maintained that she showed no signs of any extremist beliefs during their years together.According to investigators, Dr Shaheen Sayeed, associated with Al-Falah University in Faridabad, was among those arrested following Monday’s explosion near the Red Fort.Police suspect she was linked to Dr Muzammil Ganaie, another faculty member at the same university, alleged to be part of a “white-collar terror module” with ties to Jaish-e-Mohammed and Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind.Authorities said the module spread across Kashmir, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh was exposed after the recovery of 2,900 kg of explosives and the arrest of eight people, including three doctors from Al-Falah University.Investigators claim that Shaheen headed Jaish-e-Mohammed’s women’s recruitment wing, Jamaat-ul-Mominat in India.Her father, Syed Ahmad Ansari also expressed shock at the allegations.“I last spoke to Shaheen about a month ago. I have never heard her mention Dr Muzammil or anyone involved in such activities,” he said.Her father added that she had completed her medical studies in Prayagraj.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) is probing the Red Fort blast which police said was caused by a high-intensity explosive device planted in a car.Investigations by police teams across Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh are continuing into the wider multi-state module.The explosion occurred around 7 pm on Monday at the Subhash Marg traffic signal, near the Red Fort Metro Station. The high-intensity blast ripped through a slow-moving Hyundai i20 car, killing at least 12 people and injuring several others.","Mohammad Shoaib, Shaheen Sayeed’s elder brother, said the family is in “complete disbelief” over her alleged link to terrorist activities.

CJI on '79 rape ruling: 'Moment of institutional embarrassment'

'No Remorse, God Provoked Me': Lawyer Rakesh Kishore Defends His Shoe Attack On CJI BR Gavai

NEW DELHI: Admitting that Supreme Court failed its citizens, and it is the vigilance of civil society and courage of ordinary people which have kept the judiciary accountable over the years, the CJI termed SC's 1979 verdict as a ""moment of institutional embarrassment"" which acquitted two policemen accused of raping a young tribal girl inside a police station by taking her ""consent"" as voluntary because there were no visible marks of physical resistance.Delivering the 30th Justice Sunanda Bhandare Memorial Lecture, CJI B R Gavai said the apex court's verdict in Tukaram v. State of Maharashtra, also known as the Mathura case, was an institutional failure, and court's verdict reflected a deeply regressive and patriarchal understanding of consent, effectively denying the social context of power, coercion, and vulnerability in which sexual violence often occurs.""In my view, this decision remains one of the most troubling moments in India's constitutional and judicial history, and I call it a 'moment of institutional embarrassment', where the legal system failed to protect the dignity of the very person it was meant to safeguard. Yet, this judgment also became a turning point. The public outrage and the nationwide protests that followed, led by women's groups, students, and legal activists, ignited the modern Indian women's rights movement.It compelled the nation to confront the inadequacies of its criminal law and catalysed the amendments in criminal law, which redefined the concept of consent and strengthened legal protections against custodial rape,"" CJI Gavai said.The CJI was speaking on the evolution of law in building a gender equal and inclusive India. He said many pathbreaking laws were passed to bring gender justice, and courts also pitched in to ensure equality through judicial pronouncements, barring few exceptions like the 1979 verdict. He said it resulted in dismantling of the structural inequalities embedded in family and custom, bringing women from the margins of dependency to the centre of constitutional citizenship.""Over the past 75 years, India has charted an extraordinary journey in advancing the rights of women and shaping the vision of an inclusive society. From the early struggles for recognition and equality, to the present era of intersectional and participatory justice, the courts have often stood as guardians of equality and human dignity. This evolution has not been without its challenges. There have been moments when judicial interpretations failed to capture the lived realities of women or fell short of the transformative spirit of the Constitution. .. However, the vigilance of civil society, the persistence of women's movements, and the courage of ordinary citizens have together kept the judiciary accountable to the constitutional promise of equality,"" he said.""Therefore, it is important to acknowledge that progress in gender justice has never been the achievement of courts alone. The collective voice of citizens has ensured that regressive precedents were questioned, debated, and ultimately corrected through reform, reinterpretation, or legislative intervention. The dialogue between the courts and the people thus remains one of the most vital sources of India's democratic strength, reminding us that the march toward gender equality is not a destination reached, but a commitment constantly renewed,"" CJI Gavai said.","CJI BR Gavai says Supreme Court failed its citizens, and it is the vigilance of civil society and courage of ordinary people which have kept the judiciary accountable. He was speaking on the evolution of law in building a gender equal and inclusive India. He said many pathbreaking laws were passed to bring gender justice.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125285031,imgsize-609522,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-67.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Umar Un Nabi, confirmed by a DNA test as the bomber in Old Delhi, and his module had planned to carry out a ""spectacular terror attack "" with multiple vehicle-borne IEDs followed by firing with assault rifles. They had procured three vehicles - an i20, a red Ford Ecosport and a Brezza - for their mission, sources in the security establishment said on Wednesday.While the i20 exploded, cops issued a BOLO (be on the lookout) notice for the other two cars, an indication that more explosives may have been hidden by the module. The Ecosport, which has a Delhi registration number ending in 0458, was located Wednesday in Faridabad. A search is on for the Brezza. The cars were allegedly procured by Umar.The probe so far has revealed that besides Delhi, they were planning to target Ayodhya too. An attempt was to be made on Nov 25 during the hoisting of a saffron flag atop the Ram temple, said a source in a security agency. The suspects have revealed they were planning to use, and had collected, a mixture of ammonium nitrate and RDX, but it's unclear if that was the explosive in the car.The plot was hatched in Turkiye way back in 2022. As reported by TOI on Wednesday, Umar was acting on instructions from his Turkiye-based handler, identified by his codename Ukasa.A day after a car blast killed a dozen people near Red Fort, home minister Amit Shah chaired a set of meetings with the security brass and instructed agencies to hunt down every culprit behind the act.""Everyone involved in this act will face the full wrath of our agencies,"" Shah posted on X after the meetings.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the home minister from Bhutan and was briefed by the latter on all aspects of the blast, including the investigation updates. President Droupadi Murmu, who is in Angola, also spoke to Shah over the phone to enquire about the blast.The home minister on Tuesday decided to hand over the investigation into the incident to the National Investigation Agency (NIA). This points to a terror angle, though sources said it may have more to do with the Jaish terror module member linked to the blast.With Dr Umar, who had escaped the recent crackdown on the Faridabad module, suspected to be the car bomber, Shah has asked the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) to match the DNA sample collected from the body found in the i20 car used for the blast with those of Dr Umar's family members.Sources in the J&K security establishment told TOI that DNA samples collected from Dr Umar's family members had been despatched to Delhi. Shah has asked FSL officials to complete the exercise at the earliest. The NIA was instructed to submit a report at the earliest, detailing the preliminary findings.Tuesday's review meetings by Shah were attended by home secretary Govind Mohan, director of Intelligence Bureau Tapan Deka, Delhi Police commissioner Satish Golcha and NIA DG Sadanand Vasant Date.DGP of Jammu and Kashmir Nalin Prabhat joined the meeting virtually.During the meetings, top officials gave detailed presentations on the situation in the aftermath of the blast, the sources said.","Umar Un Nabi, confirmed by a DNA test as the bomber in Old Delhi, and his module had planned to carry out a ""spectacular terror attack "" with multiple vehicle- borne IEDs.

BLAST Rocks Srinagar; Nowgam Police Station Linked To Delhi-Faridabad Jaish Probe Heavily Damaged

NEW DELHI: Nine people were killed and several others sustained injuries after an explosion at the Nowgam police station in the outskirts of Srinagar.According to PTI, the blast took place when the police and forensic team officials were extracting samples from a massive cache of explosives recently seized in connection with the 'white-collar' terror module case.The material had been brought from Faridabad, Haryana, and was part of the 360 kg of explosive chemicals recovered from the rented residence of arrested doctor Muzammil Ganaie, officials said, PTI reported.The bodies have been shifted to the Police Control Room in Srinagar. At least 24 police personnel and three civilians have been admitted to various hospitals across the city, the officials said.Five of the injured are in critical condition, and officials warned that the toll may rise.The massive explosion shattered the quiet of the night and caused significant damage to the police station building. Ambulances and police vehicles rushed to the scene, with sirens piercing the air as the injured were taken to nearby hospitals.Small successive explosions after the initial blast briefly delayed rescue operations by the bomb disposal squad. While some of the seized explosives are stored at the police forensic lab, officials said the bulk of the 360 kg cache was being kept at the Nowgam police station, where the primary case linked to the terror module is registered.The terror module was uncovered after threatening posters targeting police and security forces appeared on walls in Bunpora, Nowgam, in mid-October. Srinagar Police registered a case on October 19 and formed a special team to investigate.A detailed CCTV analysis led to the arrest of Arif Nisar Dar alias Sahil, Yasir-ul-Ashraf, and Maqsood Ahmad Dar alias Shahid, all previously booked in stone-pelting cases—who were seen pasting the posters.Their interrogation pointed to Maulvi Irfan Ahmad, a former paramedic-turned-Imam from Shopian, accused of supplying the posters and radicalising the doctors.The probe eventually led police to Al Falah University in Faridabad, where doctors Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie and Shaheen Sayeed were arrested, and where investigators seized the 360 kg of suspected ammonium nitrate, along with 2,900 kg of IED-making material, including chemicals, detonators, wires, and other bomb-making components, were seized.Earlier this week, a powerful blast ripped through a Hyundai i20 near Delhi’s Red Fort, leaving at least 13 dead and several others injured.","The blast took place when the police and forensic team officials were extracting samples from a massive cache of explosives.

Karoline Leavitt stirred a fresh row after claiming that climate change is “based on a fallacy."" Environmental activists were not very happy with White House Press Secretary's comments.Leavitt made the remark during an appearance on Fox News while attacking California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom. Leavitt accused him of damaging the state with environmental policies she mocked as the “Green New Scam”. She said, “Gavin has done so much damage to his state, with the ‘Green New Scam’ and with this utopian pursuit of climate change that is just so false, it's built on a fallacy, and he's built up energy costs [so much] that people are fleeing the state. ” Her comments run counter to the overwhelming scientific consensus on global warming.Recently, Congress released tens of thousands of Jeffrey Epstein’s emails, which implicated that US President Trump knew about Epstein and the 'underage girls' in the sex trafficker's house. Democratic lawmakers have also advanced a petition to the White House demanding that even more related records be made public.","Leavitt made the remark during an appearance on Fox News while attacking California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom.

Russia counters US draft with its own UN Gaza resolution







Russian President Vladimir Putin and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke over the phone on Saturday to review key developments in the Middle East.According to a joint statement from the Kremlin and the Prime Minister’s Office, the leaders discussed the situation in Gaza, Iran’s nuclear programme, and ongoing dynamics in Syria.According to the Israeli readout, the call was initiated by Putin. Netanyahu’s office noted that this was the latest in a series of recent exchanges between the two leaders, adding that their discussions have focused on regional issues, as cited by the Times of Israel.The Kremlin described the discussion as “a thorough exchange of views.""The two leaders had last spoken in September regarding the US-brokered ceasefire proposal, during which Putin reiterated Moscow’s stance “in favor of a comprehensive settlement of the Palestinian issue.”Meanwhile, Russia on Thursday put forward its own draft UN resolution on Gaza, directly challenging a US push for the Security Council to endorse US President Donald Trump’s Gaza peace plan. In a note to Council members, Russia’s UN mission said its “counter-proposal is inspired by the US draft.”""The objective of our draft is to enable the Security Council to develop a balanced, acceptable, and unified approach toward achieving a sustainable cessation of hostilities,"" the draft read, as cited by Reuters.The Russian draft, reviewed by Reuters, asks the UN secretary-general to outline options for an international stabilization force in Gaza. It notably omits any reference to the “Board of Peace,” the transitional administration proposed in the US plan.The US mission to the UN called on the Security Council to proceed with consideration of Washington’s draft resolution.Israel and Hamas agreed in October to the first phase of Trump’s 20-point Gaza plan, reached amid their two-year conflict and a related hostage-release arrangement. The full plan is attached as an annex to the US draft resolution.While Trump has ruled out deploying US troops to Gaza, US officials have outlined a potential force of roughly 20,000 personnel and have held talks with Indonesia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Qatar, Turkey and Azerbaijan on possible contributions.","Russian President Vladimir Putin and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke over the phone on Saturday to review key developments in the Middle East.

'These are only possessed by armed forces': 9mm cartridges recovered at Delhi car blast site,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/investigation-widens-in-delhi-car-blast-9mm-cartridges-recovered-no-weapon-found-at-site/articleshow/125359370.cms,"Chilling Terror Attack Masterplan: How Medical Professionals Built A 5-Step Nationwide Bombing Plot

(With agency inputs)





NEW DELHI: In a major development in the Red Fort car blast case, Delhi Police sources on Sunday confirmed that the three cartridges recovered from the site—two live and one empty—were 9mm calibre, a type of firearm prohibited for civilian use.A senior official said that although a cartridge was recovered, no pistol or its parts were found at the scene.""These cartridges are usually only possessed by the armed forces or those with special permission,"" police said.According to sources, no pistol or any part of it was recovered from the scene—indicating that while cartridges were found, the weapon used to fire them remains untraced.Officials said they are now trying to determine how the cartridges reached the spot and whether the suspect had them in his possession.The recovery of the 9mm cartridges has added a new layer to the investigation, with agencies probing the source of the ammunition and examining possible links to terror or criminal networks. Security teams have also reviewed CCTV footage and collected forensic evidence from the blast site.On November 10, the blast near the Red Fort complex in the national capital killed 13 people and injured several others.A day earlier, Delhi Police registered a fresh FIR under sections of criminal conspiracy in the Red Fort blast investigation, officials said.The new FIR comes just days after the car blast near the historic Red Fort on November 10 that claimed 13 lives.Meanwhile, security around the monument has been tightened, with authorities maintaining strict vigilance at all entry points and in the surrounding areas.On Friday, the National Medical Commission (NMC) had cancelled the registration of four doctors from Jammu and Kashmir - Dr Muzaffar Ahmad, Dr Adeel Ahmad Rather, Dr Muzamil Shakeel and Dr Shaheen Saeed - in the Indian Medical Register/National Medical Register with immediate effect, sources told ANI.All State Medical Councils have been informed about the decision.An order has been issued to all medical councils regarding the removal of the above four doctors, effective November 14, 2025.Delhi police have already arrested Dr Adeel Ahmad Rather, Dr Muzamil Shakeel and Dr Shaheen Saeed in connection with the Delhi blast case, as they had an alleged link to past terror cases.Investigation agencies on Thursday revealed that around eight suspects were allegedly planning coordinated explosions at four locations, with each pair assigned to a specific target city.Preliminary findings indicate that the accused intended to operate in pairs, each carrying multiple improvised explosive devices (IEDs) for simultaneous attacks.Delhi Police confirmed that the car blast near the Red Fort was carried out by Dr Umar Un Nabi, after forensic DNA testing matched his biological sample with that of his mother.Al-Falah University, meanwhile, has distanced itself from Dr Umar and Dr Muzammil, stating that the institution has no connection with the accused beyond their official capacities and that no suspicious chemicals or materials are used or stored on campus.Forensic teams have collected DNA, explosive, and other evidence from the blast site for detailed examination. The investigation has now been handed over to the National Investigation Agency (NIA).Separately, an accidental explosion at Nowgam Police Station late Friday night left nine personnel dead and 32 others injured, causing extensive damage to the building and nearby structures.","Three 9mm calibre cartridges were recovered from the scene of the Red Fort car blast.

Chilling Terror Attack Masterplan: How Medical Professionals Built A 5-Step Nationwide Bombing Plot





NEW DELHI: Delhi blast investigators suspect that triacetone triperoxide explosive aka TATP could be one of the key components of the IED that was in the car that exploded on 11 of November, Monday evening near Red Fort.TATP, has been used in several major bombings across the world over the past two decades, earning the nickname “mother of satan” due to its extreme volatility and destructive power.Cheap and easy to manufacture using household chemicals, TATP has become the explosive of choice for many terror groups because it is difficult to detect and capable of producing massive blasts.Also read: Inside Dr Umar’s escape: How Delhi Red Fort ‘bomber’ fled Al-Falah University after Dr Muzammil’s arrest One of the earliest known plots involving TATP came in December 2001, when Richard Reid, later known as the “Shoe Bomber”, attempted to blow up American Airlines Flight 63. He had hidden a TATP device inside the sole of his shoe, but passengers and crew overpowered him before he could trigger the explosive.One of the most devastating attacks involving TATP was the July 2005 London bombings (7/7)Four coordinated suicide attacks targeted London's public transport system, killing 52 people and injuring hundreds, TATP was the main explosive used in the devicesRead also: ‘Mother of Satan’ in Delhi car blast? A decade later, in November 2015, TATP once again played a central role in the horrific Paris attacks, a series of coordinated attacks, including mass shootings and suicide bombings, took place across Paris, resulting in 130 deaths.TATP was used in the suicide vests worn by the attackers.The explosive was also used in the March 2016 Brussels bombings, where coordinated suicide attacks at Brussels Airport and the Maalbeek metro station killed 32 civilians and injured more than 300.In the May 2017 Manchester Arena bombing, a suicide bomber detonated a TATP-based device at the exit of an Ariana Grande concert, killing 22 people, including children, and injuring over 1,000.","TATP has been used in several major bombings across the world over the past two decades.

BAREILLY: An Allahabad-based advocate has filed a public interest litigation (PIL) in the Allahabad High Court alleging serious lapses in staffing and infrastructure at Mental Hospital Bareilly. Advocate Ankit Shukla, citing multiple RTI replies, said that no qualified psychiatrist has been appointed as director and chief superintendent since March 11, 2024.“Instead, an MBBS doctor has been given charge, in violation of Rule 20(F) of the State Mental Health Rules, which mandates that only a postgraduate psychiatrist can head such an institution,” he said.Shukla added that RTI responses show the 498-bed hospital is running with doctors, nurses, psychologists and other staff far below the ratios prescribed under the Centre’s 2007 guidelines.“I have also submitted in the PIL that the hospital lacks basic facilities such as an X-ray machine, CT scan, ICU, emergency services, an ECT unit and even a functional pathology lab,” he said.Shukla said the additional chief standing counsel sought time to produce instructions regarding steps to address the deficiencies. The next hearing is scheduled for Dec 11.","An Allahabad-based advocate has filed a public interest litigation (PIL) in the Allahabad High Court alleging serious lapses in staffing and infrastructure.

PATNA: Congress leader Digvijaya Singh on Saturday claimed that the Bihar assembly election results were similar to the polls held in North Korea, Russia and China, where “all votes go to one party”.The BJP-led NDA decimated the Mahagathbandhan, an alliance of Congress, RJD and other parties, in the Bihar elections, winning over 200 seats in the 243-member House. The Congress won only six seats.“Sixty-two lakh names were deleted, and 20 lakh names were added. The Election Commission (EC) has not clarified whose names were removed and whose were added.“The results that have come resemble elections in North Korea, China and Russia, where all votes go to one party,” the Rajya Sabha member told reporters at Awan village, about 40 km from the Guna district headquarters in Madhya Pradesh.Singh said it is one’s right to know whether the vote he cast went to the intended candidate.“The counting of my vote should happen. I should get a receipt showing where my vote has gone. Wherever EVMs (Electronic Voting Machines) are used in the world, a receipt is given after pressing the button. It is the EC’s responsibility that people should have trust in the EVM,” he said.Asked whether the ‘Mukhyamantri Mahila Rojgar Yojana’, giving Rs 10,000 each to women entrepreneurs, became a factor in Bihar polls, the Congress leader said, “Whose money is that? It is the people’s money.You take money from the people with one hand and give it back with the other.”Responding to a question concerning the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral lists, Singh said the onus of adding names to the electoral roll lies with the EC.“It should ensure that the form is filled. Now they are saying you fill the form, bring your father’s birth certificate, bring your grandfather’s birth certificate. Someone who has not passed matriculation, where will he get a matriculation certificate from,” he asked.He also accused the EC of making the process complicated.“Your passport is made with Aadhaar, and you can open a bank account with Aadhaar. Then why is Aadhaar not being used here? The Supreme Court has already said so. They have listed 11 documents but not included Aadhaar,” he said.","BJP-led NDA decimated the Mahagathbandhan, an alliance of Congress, RJD and other parties, in the Bihar elections.

Hasan Piker reacts to claims and talks about China, Cuba, and IShowSpeed







Hasan Piker, who everyone knows as HasanAbi on Twitch, spoke very openly after many people online said he was “spreading Chinese propaganda.” He talked about this during his livestream on November 14, 2025. The talk started when he read a post from X (Twitter) made on November 13, 2025, by user @joni_askola. The post said that Hasan Piker was “doing Chinese propaganda for a living.” This comment came while Hasan is on a trip to China.Hasan Piker said he does not agree with these claims. He told his viewers that China is a country with good things and bad things, just like any other place, and visiting the country does not mean he is promoting anything.He also said that many foreign affairs people are “not very fond” of him being in China right now. Hasan shared that he finds it strange that people get angry when he goes to China but do not react the same way when he visits other places like Japan. During the stream , Hasan Piker read the full post from @joni_askola and said he did not understand why people think traveling to China means he supports everything the government does. He said he always talks about both sides, the good and the bad, and that he enjoys learning about new cultures and meeting people.He said he feels lucky to be able to visit China and see things with his own eyes. He shared that the food, culture, and people have all been very nice to him. He also said that online critics make travel seem like a crime, which he finds very odd.Hasan Piker compared the reaction to when YouTuber IShowSpeed went to China. He said nobody gave IShowSpeed the same trouble because many of IShowSpeed’s fans are very young and do not stay active on X. Hasan explained that younger fans usually do not argue on social media the same way older audiences do.Hasan then talked about Cuba. He joked that a trip to Cuba would be even worse because he believes he would land in prison afterwards. This came up when a viewer commented that people would react the same way if he went to Cuba.Also Read: Who Is Jack Doherty?

In the entire history of the United States, the country has never elected a female president. This year, as nations from Japan to Italy make headlines by elevating women to their highest offices, the US still lags.So, is America ready for a woman in the Oval Office?According to former First Lady Michelle Obama , the answer is no. She said the country is still not prepared for a female president and that the US has “a lot of growing up to do.”“As we saw in this past election, sadly, we ain’t ready,” Obama said. “That’s why I’m like, don’t even look at me about running, because you all are lying. You’re not ready for a woman. You are not.” President Donald Trump defeated former vice president Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.Obama made the remarks during a November 5 conversation at the Brooklyn Academy of Music for her podcast. The discussion with actor Tracee Ellis Ross centred on Obama’s new book, “The Look.”Ross had asked Obama if she felt that the first lady role, serving as an archetype for “wifedom and femininity,” had affected “the room that we’ve made for a woman to be president.” “You know, we got a lot of growing up to do, and there’s still, sadly, a lot of men who do not feel like they can be led by a woman, and we saw it,” Obama continued.Obama stumped for Harris on the 2024 campaign trail, drawing large crowds to campaign events, advocating for women’s health care and pleading with men to vote for Harris.

Border patrol deployments triggered a wave of arrests in Charlotte on Saturday, with federal agents moving into multiple locations.“We are surging DHS law enforcement to Charlotte to ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed,” Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.Local officials including Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles criticised the operation, saying it “are causing unnecessary fear and uncertainty.” The statement, also signed by County Commissioner Mark Jerrell and Stephanie Sneed of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg education board, added, “We want people in Charlotte and Mecklenburg County to know we stand with all residents who simply want to go about their lives.”Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden confirmed earlier this week that two federal officials had told him Customs agents would be arriving soon.Paola Garcia, a spokesperson with Camino — a bilingual nonprofit serving families in Charlotte — said she and her colleagues had observed an increase in Border Patrol and ICE agents pulling people over since Friday. “Basically what we're seeing is that there have been lots of people being pulled over,” Garcia said. “I even saw a few people being pulled over on the way to work yesterday, and then just from community members seeing an increase in ICE and border patrol agents in the city of Charlotte.Willy Aceituno, a Honduran-born US citizen, was on his way to work when he saw agents chasing people. “I saw a lot of Latinos running. I wondered why they were running. The thing is, there were a lot of Border Patrol agents chasing them,” he said. Aceituno, a 46-year-old Charlotte resident, said he was stopped twice by Border Patrol agents. On the second encounter, they forced him out of his vehicle after breaking the car window and threw him to the ground. “I told them, 'I'm an American citizen,'” he told The Associated Press. “They wanted to know where I was born, or they didn't believe I was an American citizen.” He was finally allowed to go free after showing documents that proved his citizenship.Charlotte is a racially diverse city of more than 900,000 residents, including more than 150,000 who are foreign-born, according to local officials.Local organisations responded by holding trainings to inform immigrants of their rights and considering peaceful protests. President Donald Trump’s administration has defended federal enforcement operations in cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago as necessary for fighting crime and enforcing immigration laws.Governor Josh Stein, a Democrat with a Republican-majority legislature, said on Friday that the “vast majority” of those detained in these operations had no criminal convictions, and some were American citizens. He urged people to record any “inappropriate behaviour” they saw and notify local law enforcement about it.The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department had emphasised ahead of time that it was not involved in federal immigration enforcement.","Charlotte is a racially diverse city of more than 900,000 residents, including more than 150,000 who are foreign-born.

Just months after its opening, a portion of a highway bridge in China’s Sichuan province collapsed on Tuesday, giving in to a combination of a landslide and apparent structural weakness.The Hongqi bridge in Maerkang, is a 758-metre-long span on a national highway designed to improve travel between Sichuan, China’s central regions, and Tibet, Reuters reported.Footage from the scene shows debris slamming onto the bridge, with part of the span breaking away and falling into the river below. A large plume of dust rose from the collapse site as rubble scattered across the surrounding valley.The bridge was only completed earlier this year, a milestone that the contractor, Sichuan Road & Bridge Group, shared in a video posted on social media.Local authorities confirmed that the incident occurred when landslides struck a mountainside overlooking the structure.However, there were no casualties as the bridge was already closed to traffic before the collapse.Police had shut the structure on Monday afternoon after engineers spotted cracks on slopes and nearby roads, and detected shifts in the mountain terrain above the bridge. Officials in Maerkang said that the closure decision was taken as soon as the cracks and ground movement were detected, and that worsening instability on Tuesday directly led to the collapse, New York Post reported.According to the local government, conditions deteriorated rapidly the following day.On Tuesday afternoon, the weakening mountainside gave way, triggering landslides that destroyed the approach bridge and roadbed.The destroyed bridge section was part of a key highway link intended to ease travel between Sichuan, China’s interior, and the Tibetan Plateau.","A portion of a highway bridge in China's Sichuan province collapsed on Tuesday, giving in to a combination of a landslide and apparent structural weakness.

Nikki Haley Warns Donald Trump of ‘Strategic Disaster’ as 50% US Tariff on India Nears Deadline





Amid the ongoing Christian-Hinduism controversy, Nalin Haley , the son of former US ambassador to UN Nikki Haley, has spoken about his unique journey in finding his faith in a multi-faith family. In an interview with UnHerd, the 24-year-old Indian-origin MAGA voice said he was confused over religion in his childhood. His maternal grandparents who were almost his surrogate parents, followed Sikhism while his parents were Protestant Christians.Haley said he immersed himself in books on world religions to find out what he should follow when other kids of his age were reading about cars and dinosaurs. Eventually, he concluded that Christianity is the true faith but the conclusion was preceded by a spiritual experience that he did not detail in the interview.“I needed to research my own faith better in terms of the history, the early beliefs, the Church Fathers,” he said. “When I did that, I felt as though anyone who does that kind of research will walk away a Catholic.”The interview comes as Hindu Indian-origin politicians in the US are facing unprecedented attacks over their religion. Vice President JD Vance recently said he would like to see his wife Usha Vance converted to Christianity.Though JD clarified that Usha Vance has no intention of converting, the episode showed how MAGA is Christian nationalists at core and unapologetic about it.Haley said he chose his political path too in a similar fashion. I was not just going to have the same political views as my parents,” he said adding that he supported Nikki Haley in the 2024 Republican primary only to be a ""good son"". “I didn’t and was never going to be an advocate for a view that I did not have,"" he said. Like he thinks the US should stop legal immigration as well, though he himself belongs to an immigrant family.","Nalin Haley, the son of former US ambassador to UN Nikki Haley, has spoken about his unique journey in finding his faith in a multi-faith family.

Amid MAGA mayhem triggered by President Donald Trump's rage against Marjorie Taylor Greene, GOP leader Vivek Ramaswamy still dominated social media chatter as MAGA supporters exclaimed that Trump rescinded support for Marjorie but made a fresh endorsement for Ramaswamy -- as MAGA equations are changing.While Trump and Greene's fallout was mostly over the Epstein files, Greene objected to Trump's H-1B stand and said America does not need foreign workers. Greene said she would introduce a bill to stop H-1B visa program completely though Trump believes America needs certain foreign talent.The H-1B row amid MAGA was triggered last year during Christmas when Vivek Ramaswamy called out American culture and said American education system does not produce enough STEM workers needed for American tech companies and hence companies have to rely on H-1B. Ramaswamy was cornered, he exited from DOGE and chose Ohio politics for his future.A year before Ohio chooses its next governor in 2026, MAGA is now campaigning against him because of his Indian-origin.A viral post has claimed that Vivek's ethnicity is not the problem, but the fact that he's ""culturally Indian' makes him an outsider in MAGA.

What is the new limitation on green card?





The Donald Trump administration is working on a policy change that would limit green cards and other approvals for immigrants who are from Trump's 'travel ban' countries. In June, President Trump signed a travel ban on 12 countries in Africa and the Middle East.

Months after reigniting his long-standing dispute with London Mayor Sadiq Khan, US President Donald Trump has once again launched a sharp attack, calling him a “terrible mayor” and a “nasty person”.The remarks were made during an interview with GB News on Thursday night.""Your mayor is a disaster, I can tell you. If you put him there i wouldn't even know who he was.

‘Desperate’ For Saudi-Israel Ties, Trump 'IGNORES' Pentagon's China Threat; Okays 48 F-35 Jets Deal





US President Donald Trump on Friday indicated he was open to considering Saudi Arabia 's request to purchase F-35 stealth fighter jets. “They wanna buy a lot of jets,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, adding, “I am looking at that. They have asked me to look at it. ”Trump's comments come ahead of his meeting with Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House next week, where both sides are expected to sign economic and defence agreements, Reuters reported.The proposed sale involves 48 F-35 jets and is awaiting clearance within the US government. Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth was expected to sign off on the deal before it proceeded to an interagency review. The White House said it would not comment ahead of the president’s discussions.On being asked about the upcoming talks, Trump said it was “more than meeting, we are honouring” Saudi Arabia. He also repeated that he hoped Riyadh would join the Abraham Accords, although Saudi Arabia has resisted such a step without a clear roadmap to Palestinian statehood.As per NYT, Pentagon intelligence assessment has raised concerns that China could gain access to the F-35’s sensitive technology if the sale goes ahead.People familiar with the Defence Intelligence Agency’s findings told the newspaper that US officials are worried about potential Chinese espionage and Beijing’s expanding security cooperation with Riyadh.Saudi defence minister Prince Khalid bin Salman recently took to social media to share that he had met Hegseth, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff to review bilateral ties and strategic cooperation. ""We reviewed the Saudi-US relations and explored ways to bolster our strategic cooperation,"" he said, reported The New York Times.US officials are also assessing whether the sale would affect Israel’s qualitative military edge in the region given that Israel is the only country in the Middle East operating F-35s and has used them in airstrikes in Iran in October 2024 and June 2025, according to the report.In 2020, the Trump administration approved an F-35 sale to the UAE under the Abraham Accords, but the deal stalled after US officials raised concerns over Abu Dhabi’s ties with China and the potential impact on Israel’s military edge. The Biden administration paused the sale in 2021, citing fears that China could access the jet’s technology, and later proposed conditions that the UAE rejected.

GOP ERUPTS As Trump Cuts Ties With Marjorie Taylor Greene Over Epstein Document Fight | WATCH

Is Greene eyeing for a 2028 presidential run?







Donald Trump and his longtime ally Marjorie Taylor Greene picked up their last night's fight where they stopped, as Trump nicknamed Marjorie 'traitor' and called her a disgrace to the Republican Party. Marjorie said she forgives Donald Trump and prays for him to return to his original MAGA promises though she thought out loud what must be there in the Epstein file that her demand for the release of all of it for the sake of the women voters irked the president so much that he rescinded his endorsement for Greene.MTG stood by Donald Trump during the 2020 political storm and has been a longtime ally of the president. But of late, she accused Trump of forgetting his promises to the American people as Trump got more occupied with foreign affairs. Greene publicly condemned the tariff war that Trump waged with countries, pressed the administration for a full disclosure on Epstein case; pushed for a new bill to end the H-1B program.According to insiders, Trump became impatient with Greene's constant complaining and finally gave in to his frustration and anger as he made a long post on Truth Social cutting MTG loose. He called her a ranting lunatic and said Greene was upset because he could not return her calls.He asked Republicans to primary Greene and said Greene's constituents are fed up with her antics.Greene refuted Trump's claim and said she never called the president but indeed dropped a message on how the administration must come clean on sex offender Epstein issue for the sake of the women voters.Many believe that Greene has some ambitious plans up her sleeves and that's why she started to clash with the president to come out as an alternative candidate for 2028 presidential run. Greene too hinted at something new as she wrote: ""There needs to be a new way forward"".Greene said she never thought that fighting against a pedophile would make her a traitor in Trump's eyes. ""The toxic political industrial complex thrives on ripping us all apart but never delivers anything good for the American people, whom I love. The PIC tells us to hate each other, fundraises off why we have to hate each other, and pits Americans against each other to the point of violence and nearing civil war,"" Greene said.","MTG stood by Donald Trump during the 2020 political storm and has been a longtime ally of the president.

'You Don’t Have Talent in US': Donald Trump’s Shocking Shift on H-1B Visa Policy Debate

Employers prefer H-1B because...







Indian-origin Howard professor Ronil Hira, who has been a staunch critic of the H-1B visa, weighed in on the fresh H-1B controversy and explained that it is a no-brainer as to why US companies prefer H-1Bs. The fresh controversy started after President Donald Trump appeared softer on H-1B as he recently said in a FOX interview that America needs certain types of foreign talent. Weeks ago, the administration took a strong step against H-1B as it imposed a $100,000 visa fee, meaning any company that hires H-1Bs will have to cough up this amount. But Trump not dismissing H-1B outright and claiming that America needs certain talents sent a mixed signal to MAGA.As MAGA is divided and Indians are targeted in the US, Ronil Hira explained that employers love H-1B. Citing examples of Disney and the University of California, economist Ron Hira said there are widely reported incidents of American workers being forced to train their H-1B replacements, which proves that H-1B visa holders are not always high-skilled.Most of the people coming to the US on H-1B visas have ordinary skills, skills that are abundantly available from American workers, Dr Hira said.But employers prefer H-1B workers because they can legally be paid less than American workers and because they are controllable, as they are indentured to their employers. ""It's kind of a no-brainer for employers to prefer the H-1Bs. On the other side, there are some very highly qualified people who come on H-1Bs, and so the real issue is how do you fix the program so that most of the people coming in are actually filling genuine skill gaps and not coming in because they are cheaper and controllable,"" Dr Hira said.The Indian-origin expert said H-1B often gets muddled with immigration, while H-1B is a labor policy as it's a guest worker program. ""It's not an immigration issue but a labor issue. You are intervening into the labor market, injecting workers here. You should have a high bar to inject workers who have fewer rights, who are sort of second class in a lot of ways and their worker protections are just very weak. Any guest worker program needs very strong worker protection. H-1B has very weak worker protection and that's why Silicon Valley loves it,"" Dr Hira said.",Indian-origin Howard professor Ronil Hira weighed in on the fresh H-1B controversy.

Trump's H-1B U-Turn: From 'America First' To ‘US Lacks Talent’ Shocker; MAGA Stunned





WASHINGTON: MAGA supremo Donald Trump on Friday unloaded on a one-time loyalist lawmaker after she broke ranks and mutinied on a range of issues, including moving a bill to nix the H1b visa program.In growing signs of major fissures and brewing rebellion in the MAGA movement, Republican Congresswoman and conspiracy theorist Marjorie Taylor Greene, often referred to as MTG, lashed back at party supremo after he called her “wacky,” accused her of going far left, and threatened to end her political career.Among the issues MTG is tormenting Trump with is demanding release of the Epstein files which his critics believe implicate him, and challenging the President’s commitment to the “America First” credo after he defended the need for foreign workers and foreign students in a US that he insists is short of tech talent.“Maybe it was my bill to get rid of the H1B visas,” the Georgia lawmaker, for long a rabble-rouser on the fringe right, posted on X in a conjecture on why Trump is torching her political career.The bigger reason appears to be her going rogue on the Epstein files, which she and a growing band of MAGA lawmakers want released even though they purportedly implicate Trump.“It’s astonishing really how hard he’s fighting to stop the Epstein files from coming out that he actually goes to this level,” MTG said, responding to Trump’s charge that she had been harassing him with phone calls.Asserting that the President was lying, she said she had only sent him text messages seeking release of the Epstein files and “this is what drove him over the edge.”“And of course he’s coming after me hard to make an example to scare all the other Republicans before next weeks vote to release the Epstein files,” she said in a defiant post on X.“I never thought that fighting to release the Epstein files, defending women who were victims of rape, and fighting to expose the web of rich powerful elites would have caused this, but here we are,” she added on Saturday morning amid signs of a rebellion from sections of MAGA, including several lawmakers disenchanted with a range of Trump policies, including tariffs, they believe is causing disaffection in the base.A furious Trump earlier went ballistic against MTG and another mutinous Republican lawmaker, Thomas Massie, threatening to have them “primaried” (defeated by challengers in inner-party elections), and making personal attacks.“Did Thomas Massie get married already??? Boy, that was quick! Anyway, have a great life Thomas and (?). His wife will soon find out that she’s stuck with a LOSER!” the US President posted on his platform. Massie lost his wife of 31 years to breast cancer last June and married again earlier this month.The snide slight is typical of MAGA catfights where some of its mutually antagonistic divas like MTG, Laura Loomer, Candace Owens have savaged each other with charges of adultery and infidelity, mental instability and ideological betrayal, and generally dragged politics into the gutter after fighting for the supremo’s attention and affection. Loomer, a social media gadabout, is widely believed to have the President's ear currently to the extent that she can make or break careers in Washington DC.The circular fire that is making America GRATE again has included Loomer calling MTG a ""jealous bitch with roid rage” and a “a washed-up hag” and MTG responding by calling Loomer ""mentally unstable and a documented liar.""","Republican Congresswoman and conspiracy theorist Marjorie Taylor Greene, often referred to as MTG, lashed back at party supremo after he called her “wacky,” accused her of going far left, and threatened to end her political career.

Trump versus Marjorie Taylor Greene



Public fallout between Trump and MTG







After Rep Thomas Massie, President Donald Trump has now targeted his longtime ally Marjorie Taylor Greene as she was insisting on the release of Epstein documents. Trump called her 'wacky' and 'lunatic' and dumped her, making the MAGA implosion complete. The MAGA movement has lost sight with far-right influencers like Nick Fuentes being given a platform by Tucker Carlson and now it's floundering with Epstein and H-1B issue.Greene is known for her controversial remarks often fuelled by unsubstantiated conspiracy theories but her devotion to Donald Trump has been unquestionable. She stood by Trump's 2020 claims of election fraud; she also supported Trump in the wake of the Epstein controversy and said that she believed Trump has no involvement in Epstein's sex scandal.But in the recent months, Greene started breaking ranks with Trump inb several key issues. She urged Trump to focus on domestic policies instead of foreign involvement and criticized his tariff fallout, his 50-year mortgage proposal, and his stand on H-1B. Greene even proposed a bill that would phase out H-1B completely while Trump said America needs certain talents from outside and hence America will not stop hiring foreign talents.MTG is not the first Republican that Trump is going after but since she's a vocal MAGA supporter, her political breakup with Trump signals a point of no return for MAGA. MAGA supporters are divided as Trump announced he would endorse MTG's rival candidate in 2026.Trump alienated Kentucky Rep Thomas Massie as well, but a woman politician clashing with Trump over an issue that involved a pedophile sends a strong message.While Trump said MTG has been telling people that Trump did not return her calls, Greene claimed that she did not even call Trump. She said she sent messages to Trump and his aide over Epstein issue, where she urged them to stop ignoring women who openly voted for Trump.","Marjorie Taylor Greene is known for her controversial remarks often fuelled by unsubstantiated conspiracy theories.

Big breakup between Trump and Marjorie Taylor Greene: H-1B and Epstein



'Get rid of the H-1B visas'







Rep Marjorie Taylor Greene reacted to President Donald Trump's snub and said she is not Trump's servant or worshipper. MTG said she remains America First and America Only, after Trump withdrew his endorsement from the firebrand MAGA leader after MTG clashed with Trump over the Epstein files and H-1B issue. Greene is running for reelection in 2026 and now she does not have Trump's endorsement because Trump said she has gone 'Far Left'.Calling her a 'ranting Lunatic', Trump said MTG told people that she was upset that the President didn't return her phone calls anymore. But Trump said in his Truth Social post that it was not possible for him to attend every call.Greene said she didn't even call him in the first place and so the alleged disgruntlement over not returning calls is a lie. ""I have supported President Trump with too much of my precious time, too much of my own money, and fought harder for him even when almost all other Republicans turned their back and denounced him. But I don’t worship or serve Donald Trump. I worship God, Jesus is my savior, and I serve my district GA14 and the American people,"" MGT said, unleashing her full rebellion against Trump.Greene is a vocal MAGA supporter but she has been expressing her disappointment over the Trump administration openly.She is one of four House Republicans who signed on to a discharge petition to force a vote on the release of Justice Department documents on the Epstein case.MTG said Trump is making an example out of her to scare all the other Republicans so that they don't vote for the release of the Epstein files. ""It’s astonishing really how hard he’s fighting to stop the Epstein files from coming out that he actually goes to this level. But really most Americans wish he would fight this hard to help the forgotten men and women of America who are fed up with foreign wars and foreign causes, are going broke trying to feed their families, and are losing hope of ever achieving the American dream,"" Greene said.Greene is, however, not sure whether it's her insistence to release all Epstein files or her anti-H-1B bill that she proposed that rankled Trump more. As Trump recently said America needs 'certain' talents from foreign countries, MTG said she would introduce a bill to end the mass replacement of American workers by phasing out the H-1B program. ""Americans are the most talented people in the world, and I have full faith in the American people. I serve Americans only, and I will ALWAYS put Americans first.

A judiciary under reconstruction



Munir’s expanding power base



(With inputs from agencies)





Pakistan’s judiciary is in a moment of crisis as senior judges resign amid a contentious constitutional amendment reshapes the balance of power in favour of the military. Behind the crisis is the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment, a sweeping package pushed through parliament within days. Lawyers, judges and opposition parties argue that it has weakened the courts and elevated the military’s top commander to a position with no modern parallel.Since then, Pakistan’s judiciary has been hit by a series of high-profile resignations. On Saturday, Lahore High Court judge Shams Mehmood Mirza stepped down, and his family said his decision was directly linked to the 27th Amendment. His departure followed those of Supreme Court justices Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah, who issued sharply worded letters condemning the amendment as a direct attack on judicial independence.The creation of a new Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) lies at the heart of judicial restructuring. The FCC now holds exclusive jurisdiction over constitutional matters, stripping the Supreme Court of its original powers. Pending petitions have already been shifted to the new court. President Zardari swore in Justice Aminuddin Khan as its first chief justice; six other judges were appointed, including serving Supreme Court and high court judges, though one judge reportedly refused to join.The FCC’s establishment has sparked intense concern. Critics say the president’s new power to transfer judges risks becoming a tool to sideline dissenting voices. Opposition groups argue this will fundamentally weaken judicial independence and concentrate constitutional authority in the executive and military leadership.Government ministers, however, hailed the package as “historic” and a step toward greater efficiency and national unity. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the amendment proved that “solidarity” prevailed during a time of national strain.With judges resigning, courts being reconfigured, and the military gaining unprecedented constitutional control, Pakistan faces a moment of reckoning.The amendment passed with overwhelming numbers in both houses has dramatically restructured Pakistan’s defence architecture, elevating army chief Asim Munir to Chief of Defence Forces with command over all three military branches. His five-year tenure now resets from the date of notification, enabling him to remain in office until 2030.The Senate has since rushed through four related bills, including amendments to the Army, Air Force and Navy Acts, along with changes to Supreme Court practice rules. These laws remove the earlier equality among service chiefs and replace references to the Joint Chiefs of Staff system with a new “National Strategic Command”, further centralising military authority under Munir.Dawn reported that appointments, extensions, and tenures under these reforms “shall not be called into question before any court on any ground whatsoever”.Experts quoted in multiple reports warn that the shift risks internal military tensions and further erodes civilian oversight. Lawyer Osama Malik described the reforms as something “usually granted in absolute monarchies”, arguing they grant lifetime protections not only to Munir but also to President Zardari.Opposition lawmakers responded with uproar, shredding copies of the bill and walking out. PTI leaders labelled the move “deeply undemocratic” and “the final nail in the coffin of an independent judiciary”. Critics say these changes could reshape the political landscape, particularly for nearly 200 cases involving former prime minister Imran Khan.","Pakistan's judiciary is in a moment of crisis as senior judges resign amid a contentious constitutional amendment.

What next







Pakistan’s National Assembly on Wednesday passed the 27th constitutional amendment bill, granting sweeping powers to the military in general and country’s army chief Asim Munir in specific, and restructuring the judiciary.The vote, held amid a ruckus in the lower house, saw 234 lawmakers in favour and only four against, speaker Ayaz Sadiq announced. The session was attended by top political leaders, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, PML-N President Nawaz Sharif, and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari.The amendment comes at a time of heightened political tension in Pakistan, with the ruling coalition seeking to consolidate control over key defence and judicial institutions. The legislation follows earlier Senate approval, where it received 64 votes in favour and no opposition, as the opposition benches boycotted proceedings.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hailed the passage as a demonstration of national unity, saying the house exhibited solidarity. He also condemned a recent terrorist incident in Wana, drawing parallels to the Army Public School massacre, and praised law enforcement for securing the safety of students and cadets.The amendment elevates Pakistan army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir to the newly created role of Chief of Defence Forces, giving him constitutional authority over all three branches: army, navy, and air force. Honorary five-star ranks such as field marshal, marshal of the air force, and admiral of the fleet remain lifetime titles. According to the country's law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, the reform “aims to bring constitutional oversight to defence appointments while preserving military honour and tradition.The bill also establishes a federal constitutional court (FCC) to handle constitutional and provincial matters, leaving the Supreme Court to focus on civil and criminal cases. The FCC will have equal representation from all provinces and the power to take suo motu notices on constitutional petitions. The Judicial Commission will oversee judge transfers; refusal of a transfer will be treated as retirement.The ruling coalition, including PML-N, PPP, MQM-P, and allies, backed the amendment. Opposition lawmakers condemned it as unconstitutional. PTI chairman Gohar Ali Khan called it the “Baku Amendments” and accused the government of undermining democracy. Mehmood Khan Achakzai of PkMAP protested by tearing a copy of the bill in the house.The amendment now returns to the Senate for final approval before becoming law. Analysts say the 27th amendment significantly strengthens Munir’s role in Pakistan’s military hierarchy while altering judicial oversight, marking a shift in Pakistan’s institutional framework.(With input from agencies, Dawn)","The amendment elevates Pakistan army chief Asim Munir to the newly created role of Chief of Defence Forces.

Why it matters

The big picture

The Field Marshal’s expanding power evokes a hybrid of Pakistan’s two most dominant military rulers:

Ayub Khan, who introduced centralized presidential control and laid the foundations for military-led governance.

Zia-ul-Haq, who used the Army and Islamization to seize power, marginalize the judiciary, and suppress civilian opposition.

Munir is consolidating power not through martial law, but via constitutional amendments passed by a pliant parliament.

If Zia’s coup was loud and brutal against a strong popular leadership, Munir’s is silent, yet possibly more far reaching, being done through a political front office that’s pliant and dependent on the Army for authority. With Imran Khan in prison, any opposition will come from the streets and the troubled insurgencies to the west of Islamabad.

The transformation follows the India-Pakistan conflict in May 2025, a four-day exchange of air and missile strikes after the Pahalgam terror attack.

India’s Operation Sindoor targeted Pakistani airbases, radars, and command centers.

Pakistan requested a ceasefire after intense damage - a request reportedly initiated by Pakistan’s DGMO.

Donald Trump, who claimed to have brokered the truce(India has repeatedly denied the US President's claims), was effusively thanked by Munir and PM Shehbaz Sharif. Trump now calls Munir his “favorite field marshal.”

The Financial Times described their dynamic as a “bromance,” with Trump showcased on billboards across Pakistan alongside Munir and Sharif.

This international validation was followed by Munir’s promotion to Field Marshal, the second such promotion in Pakistan’s history - and the first codified under the Constitution.

Between the lines

This isn’t just about military command - it’s about rewriting the DNA of the Pakistani state.

The amendment creates a new Federal Constitutional Court, potentially diluting the powers of the Supreme Court and creating ambiguity about the hierarchy of judicial authority.

President Zardari is also granted lifelong immunity in the amendment, mirroring the legal shield given to Munir.

This dual protection signals a strategic alliance between the military and top civilian figures to institutionalize mutual insulation from accountability.

“Too much has been left to ad hoc and arbitrary decisions,” Mazari warned.

The domestic question: Can repression deliver reform?

The three-front storm: Taliban, TTP, and India

“If you nurture snakes in your backyard, they will bite you,” said Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the Pakistani military’s official spokesman, referencing the Taliban. What a comeuppance : The remark could just as well apply to all Pakistan-grown terror groups and the TTP, whose resurgence is a grim case of blowback.

The bottom line





In Pakistan, where generals have often ruled with impunity and influence, Field Marshal Asim Munir is scripting a new playbook-quiet, precise, and constitutionally sealed. His rise is not just another chapter in the country’s well-worn saga of military dominance. It is, as one senior opposition leader put it, “a rewrite of the entire power manual.”Pakistan’s controversial 27th Constitutional Amendment proposes to recast the country’s military command structure by abolishing the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) and creating the role of Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) - a position that will be held by the Army Chief, currently Field Marshal Asim Munir •The amendment vests unprecedented legal and constitutional power in the CDF, giving Munir operational and institutional control over the army, navy, and air force, as well as the country’s nuclear command.•It also grants five-star officers life-long rank, privileges, and immunity, a move seen as creating a parallel unelected authority beyond the reach of civilian or judicial oversight.“This amendment appears tailored to benefit a specific individual rather than to strengthen the defence structure,” Lt Gen Asif Yasin Malik, former defence secretary, told Dawn.The CJCSC post - created after the 1971 war to ensure coordination among services - will be dissolved on November 27, 2025, when the current chairman, Gen Sahir Shamshad Mirza, retires.The 27th Amendment represents the largest shift in Pakistan’s civil-military balance since the Zia era, codifying the military’s supremacy in a way that future civilian governments may struggle to reverse.•The military will no longer merely influence governance from behind the scenes - it will be constitutionally entrenched at the center of executive authority.•Strategic nuclear assets, previously overseen by the National Command Authority, will now fall under the commander of national strategic command, appointed by the PM on the army chief’s advice, and selected from within the army.“All nuclear weapons and delivery systems will be under army control, including second-strike missiles traditionally under the Navy,” warned Dr Shireen Mazari, former human rights minister, a Dawn report said.•The change grants the army a monopoly over promotions, transfers, and postings across the services, threatening morale and inter-service harmony.“If promotions in the Air Force and Navy are determined by an army-origin CDF, it could lead to festering resentments,” Mazari cautioned.At home, Munir is both omnipresent and embattled. According to a Financial Times report, his supporters compare him to Mohammed bin Salman or South Korea’s General Park - ruthless modernisers willing to bulldoze institutions in the name of reform. His critics, however, see echoes of Zia-ul-Haq’s theocratic militarism cloaked in constitutional legitimacy.The judiciary is already split, thanks to a proposed constitutional court that would dilute the Supreme Court’s power. Journalists are censored, civil rights groups are muzzled, and political opponents - most notably former Prime Minister Imran Khan - are jailed or silenced.And yet, Munir has cast himself as the architect of reform. In his speech at the Pakistan Military Academy, he spoke of “treasures hidden beneath our land” and claimed that Pakistan had begun to “regain its rightful place in the comity of nations.”But the economy tells another story. As per the FT report, Pakistan’s investment rate is the lowest in South Asia, its poverty rate has risen to 25%, and its youth unemployment is dangerously high. The country remains dependent on IMF bailouts and Gulf financing that has yet to materialise in promised volumes.While Munir consolidates power at home, Pakistan finds itself encircled by a resurgent triangle of threats - each historically rooted, each dangerously revived. In the west, the Afghan Taliban’s return to power in 2021 has proved more liability than leverage. Once covertly supported by Pakistan’s security establishment, the Taliban now resist Islamabad’s demands and turn a blind eye to cross-border attacks on Pakistani soil.More ominously, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), an offshoot long declared outlawed, has regrouped in Afghanistan and resumed attacks in Pakistan’s tribal belt and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. This year alone, militant violence has killed over 1,400 people - the highest toll in a decade.“The military simply lacks political support on the ground there,” Iftikhar Firdous, founder of The Khorasan Diary, told FT. “The crackdown has alienated entire communities.”Simultaneously, Pakistan’s eastern border with India remains fragile after the four-day air conflict in May.Add to that domestic insurgencies in Balochistan and the Pashtun belt, and Pakistan now faces not one, but three overlapping security fronts. Instead of acting as a force-multiplier, the military’s expanding political and economic footprint is beginning to stretch its operational capacity thin.The 27th Amendment enshrines military supremacy in Pakistan's Constitution under the guise of reform and modernization.•It moves the country further away from parliamentary democracy, and deeper into military-led constitutional authoritarianism.•As Field Marshal Asim Munir prepares to become the first Chief of Defence Forces, Pakistan’s most consequential question remains: Can a military man fix a failing nation - or will history repeat itself?(With inputs from agencies)","Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment. Munir is consolidating power not through martial law, but via constitutional amendments passed by a pliant parliament. With Imran Khan in prison, any opposition will come from the streets and the troubled insurgencies to the west of Islamabad.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,imgsize-110164,width-400,resizemode-4/47529300.jpg"
