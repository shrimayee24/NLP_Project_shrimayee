Taliban's Diplomatic Signal From Darul Uloom Deoband: Muttaqi Says India-Afghan Ties Look ‘Bright’

SRINAGAR: Accused of promoting “land jihad” through her proposed land regularisation bill, PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti struck back Sunday — charging BJP with “embracing the Taliban” while allegedly branding Indian Muslims as extremists.“In the garb of accusing people of waging ‘jihad’, Muslims were lynched and demonised. Yet today, this government salutes the Taliban ,” she told supporters at Eidgah in Srinagar. She accused BJP-led Union government of engaging with the same Taliban it once branded terrorists.“BJP once wanted to lock Darul Uloom Deoband, now takes Afghan ministers there to shower them with flowers. If it can talk to the Taliban, why can’t it talk to its own people in J&K?”Her remarks came days after the BJP’s J&K unit described PDP’s proposed J&K Land Rights and Regularisation Bill, 2025 as an act of “land jihad and legislative jihad”.PDP’s draft legislation, unveiled by Mehbooba on Oct 8, seeks to regularise land holdings of people and institutions in continuous possession for more than 30 years. It also aims to prevent arbitrary evictions and ensure ownership security — provisions BJP claims could legitimise alleged illegal encroachments.Taking to social media, Mehbooba alleged that under slogans such as “love jihad”, “land jihad”, “vote jihad”, and “cow jihad”, BJP has been targeting Muslims and vilifying an entire community.“India, which calls itself the mother of democracy, is now embracing the Taliban — the father of jihad — under BJP rule,” she wrote.Mehbooba cited India’s recent outreach to Afghanistan, including educational scholarships for Afghan students, as evidence of what she called government's “contradictory” approach. “While maintaining good relations with Afghanistan may be strategically important, India’s own Muslim population — who have contributed to the country’s identity and progress — are being deprived of rights and opportunities,” she said.She urged government to focus on dialogue within J&K. “Building international relations is important, but peace and harmony must begin at home,” Mehbooba said.BJP has yet to respond officially to her latest remarks, but party functionaries have earlier said the proposed bill is an attempt to “legitimise illegal occupations under the guise of reform”.","PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti accuses BJP of 'embracing the Taliban' She accuses BJP- led Union government of engaging with the same Taliban it once branded terrorists.

Although the protection was briefly reinstated later, it was again removed when he was sent to Sitapur jail.With a steady flow of visitors thronging his residence after his recent release, authorities reviewed and restored his security cover yet again in view of potential law and order concerns, considering Khan's political influence and high-profile status in Rampur, said sources.Following formal orders to reinstate his protection detail, security personnel and gunners assigned to Khan resumed duty Saturday, official sources said. Khan's security was enhanced with a Gypsy vehicle and seven armed personnel deployed for his protection.

NEW DELHI: The Congress will not contest the upcoming Rajya Sabha elections to four seats in Jammu and Kashmir from the “unsafe” fourth seat, the party’s Jammu and Kashmir unit announced on Sunday.J&K Congress president Tariq Hamid Karra said the party’s central leadership had sought one of the two Rajya Sabha seats that will go to polls separately. However, ally National Conference (NC) offered Congress one of the other two seats, for which polls will be held under a common notification.“All the participants were of the opinion that seat four is not safe (un)like seat one or two. It was unanimously decided that we will not put up our candidate for seat number four. We will leave it to our alliance partners to see what they think about that,” Karra told reporters after a party meeting in Srinagar, according to PTI.“Since the safe seat was not offered to us, we don’t want to contest on seat four,” he added.Karra further said the Congress would open its “channels” with the NC to resolve the impasse. “The inputs from our members will be sent to our central leadership for guidance,” the J&K Congress chief stated.The NC has already named its three candidates for the Rajya Sabha polls, indicating it will use its strength in the assembly to ensure all three emerge victorious. While all three NC nominees are assured of victory even without the support of allies, the fourth candidate of the ruling alliance would need every anti-BJP vote to ensure a clean sweep.The three MLAs of the PDP and one each from the People’s Conference, Awami Ittehad Party, and AAP would have to vote for the ruling alliance’s candidate to secure the fourth seat.Last year, the Congress decided not to be part of the Jammu and Kashmir government despite the NC-Congress alliance winning the September 2024 assembly polls — the region’s first since it became a Union territory in 2019.The upcoming Rajya Sabha polls will be held on October 24.","J&K Congress president Tariq Hamid Karra said the party’s central leadership had sought one of the two Rajya Sabha seats that will go to polls separately.

NEW DELHI: A 31-member committee formed in the Haryana IPS officer Y Puran Kumar's alleged suicide case suicide, on Sunday, gave the Chandigarh administration and Haryana government 48 hours to remove state police chief Shatrujeet Kapur.Kapur is among the officers named by Kumar’s wife, IAS officer Amneet P Kumar, for allegedly abetting her husband’s suicide.The committee made this demand during a mahapanchayat in Chandigarh on Sunday. Heavy police were deployed around the venue.“The Haryana DGP and former Rohtak SP should be arrested. The DGP must be removed from his post. We have given 48 hours, after which we will decide the next course of action,” a committee spokesperson told reporters, as quoted by news agency PTI.Six days have passed since Kumar, who was last posted as IG at the Police Training Centre in Rohtak’s Sunaria, died. His post-mortem and cremation have not been conducted, as the family is refusing consent until their demands are met.The mahapanchayat saw tension when former Haryana MP Raj Kumar Saini reportedly made a controversial remark, sparking anger among attendees. Calm was restored after organisers intervened.A message from Kumar’s family was read, appealing for support in their pursuit of justice. Committee members also demanded a judicial probe into the case, said Gurmail Singh, a committee member. “The family and dalit community fear that if the last rites are conducted, the government may not take action against the accused,” said Karamvir, a committee member. He also questioned the work done by the Special Investigation Team set up by Chandigarh police.Fifty-two-year-old Kumar, a 2001-batch IPS officer, allegedly shot himself at his Chandigarh home on October 7. In an eight-page note reportedly left behind, he named eight senior officers, including DGP Kapur and former Rohtak SP Narendra Bijarniya, accusing them of harassment and tarnishing his image. The note also mentioned caste-based discrimination.The Haryana government has transferred Bijarniya, replacing him with IPS officer Surinder Singh Bhoria.In her complaint to Chandigarh Police, Amneet P Kumar sought an FIR against Kapur and Bijarniya under Section 108 (abetment of suicide) and relevant provisions of the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, demanding their arrest. She also requested amendments to the FIR to include all accused officers’ names.Haryana ministers and senior officials, including chief secretary Anurag Rastogi, recently met the family to persuade them to agree to the post-mortem and cremation.","Y Puran Kumar, a 2001-batch IPS officer, allegedly shot himself at his Chandigarh home on October 7.

Taliban's Diplomatic Signal From Darul Uloom Deoband: Muttaqi Says India-Afghan Ties Look ‘Bright’

What is Darul Uloom Deoband?



The Afghan connection: How Deobandi Islam reached Afghanistan



NEW DELHI: Taliban ’s foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi visited the Darul Uloom Deoband in Saharanpur on Saturday, meeting Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind President Maulana Arshad Madani and other senior officials of the seminary.Muttaqi expressed gratitude for the warm reception and optimism about India-Afghanistan ties. “I am thankful to all of you for the warm welcome given to me by everyone in Deoband and the love showered upon me. I will pray to God that India-Afghanistan relations improve further,” he said, as quoted by news agency ANI.The Afghan leader highlighted the significance of educational and cultural ties, noting that no political discussions took place but that historical connections were celebrated.As per news agency ANI, Maulana Arshad Madani emphasised the historical role of Afghanistan in India’s independence struggle and reassured that Afghanistan would not allow terrorists to use its soil against India.This visit is part of a week-long trip to India by Muttaqi, marking the first high-level delegation from Kabul since the Taliban took power in 2021.Darul Uloom Deoband, established in 1866 in present-day Uttar Pradesh, is one of South Asia’s most influential Islamic seminaries.It was founded by scholars including Maulana Muhammad Qasim Nanautawi and Maulana Rashid Muhammad Gangohi to educate Muslim youth in a rigorous, orthodox understanding of Islam, known as Deobandi Islam.The seminary was originally part of an anti-colonial movement aimed at revitalising Islam and resisting British rule in India. Over the decades, Deobandi schools spread throughout India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and other parts of South Asia.While Darul Uloom Deoband is in India, its teachings spread across the border into Pakistan and Afghanistan. Pashtun communities were instrumental in establishing Deobandi seminaries along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, according to The Conversation.The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 accelerated this process as Deobandi madrassas, supported by Pakistani authorities and funding from Saudi Arabia and the CIA, educated Afghan refugee youth who would join the anti-Soviet resistance.Many of these students later became key figures in the Taliban. The movement’s founder, Mullah Mohammad Omar, and other Taliban leaders were educated in Deobandi-inspired seminaries in Pakistan, adopting a version of the ideology that included ultraconservative Wahhabi influences, as per NPR.While the Taliban identify as Deobandis, scholars at the original Indian seminary emphasise that their interpretation diverged from classical Deobandi teachings.“The Taliban say they are doing what we did in India. The way we kicked the British out of India, that’s what the Taliban are doing in Afghanistan,” said Maulana Arshad Madani back in 2021 when the Taliban took control over Afghanistan, clarifying that there is no organisational link between the seminary and the Taliban, as per NPR.This visit of Taliban’s foreign minister comes amid efforts to improve India-Afghanistan relations, as Muttaqi emphasised hopes for increased exchanges and cooperation, including in regional projects like the Chabahar port in Iran.The visit reinforces the soft-power and cultural dimension of diplomacy between the two countries while acknowledging the centuries-old educational and religious links that connect them.",Amir Khan Muttaqi visited the Darul Uloom Deoband in Saharanpur on Saturday.

IDF launches Operation “Returning Home”



All dead hostages may not be back on Monday







Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday acknowledged divisions over the Gaza ceasefire deal but urged citizens to unite ahead of the expected release of hostages held by Hamas under the prisoner exchange agreement.“This is an emotional evening, an evening of tears, an evening of joy, because tomorrow our children will return to our borders,” Netanyahu said in a televised address, quoting a biblical verse. “Tomorrow is the beginning of a new path - a path of rebuilding, a path of healing, and, I hope, a path of united hearts.”The Prime Minister’s remarks came amid criticism from both sides of Israel’s political spectrum - from families of hostages who accused him of prioritising military goals over their release, and from right-wing members of his coalition who opposed freeing Palestinian prisoners.“This is a historic event that mixes sorrow over the release of murderers with joy over the return of hostages,” Netanyahu said.“I know there are many disagreements among us, but on this day ... we have every reason to put them aside, because together we achieved tremendous victories,” he added.Netanyahu also said Israel was ready to receive the hostages expected to be freed on Monday. “Israel is prepared and ready for the immediate reception of all our hostages,” he said in a separate statement issued Sunday.He added that while Israel had made “tremendous victories” during two years of conflict, the fight was not over: “Together we achieved tremendous victories, victories that amazed the whole world... But at the same time I must tell you, the fight is not over,” Netanyahu said. “Very large security challenges still lie before us.”Meanwhile, the Israel defense forces (IDF) announced the launch of Operation “Returning Home” to bring back the hostages. “In a few hours we will all be reunited - one people, embraced and united,” said Lt Gen Eyal Zamir, Israel’s Chief of the General Staff, in a statement posted on X.He said the operation followed two years of sustained military and diplomatic pressure. “The military pressure we applied over the past two years, together with the complementary diplomatic measures, constitute a victory over Hamas,” Zamir added. “We will continue to act in order to ensure the Gaza Strip no longer poses a threat to the State of Israel and its civilians.”An Israeli Military official said that they are expecting that not all dead hostages may return to Israel on Monday.""Unfortunately this is something we anticipate that not all fallen hostages will be returned tomorrow,"" the official told reporters during a briefing late on Sunday.Earlier Sunday, Shosh Bedrosian, spokeswoman for the prime minister's office, had said an ""international body"" would be established to locate the remains of captives not returned as part of Monday's exchange.Israel, however, will not send a representative to the US-led peace summit on Gaza scheduled Monday in Sharm el-Sheikh, co-hosted by President Donald Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, according to a statement to AFP by Netanyahu’s spokeswoman Shosh Bedrosian.(With inputs from agencies)",Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday acknowledged divisions over the Gaza ceasefire deal.

Here are 10 things to know:

What Pakistan claimed



What Taliban said





Bone of contention: TTP







Fifteen Pakistani soldiers were killed in a ""retaliatory"" operation by Afghan forces in Helmand province on Saturday night, Kabul based news outlet Hurriyat Radio reported.Maulvi Mohammad Qasim Riaz, spokesperson for the Afghanistan's Helmand provincial government, told the media that Afghan forces carried out the operation near the Durand Line in the Bahramcha district. Afghan troops also captured three Pakistani security posts during the attack.Riaz added that a number of weapons and ammunition were seized by Afghan forces in the operation.The Afghan forces conducted attacks on Pakistan i posts across Helmand, Kandahar, Zabul, Paktika, Paktia, Khost, Nangarhar, and Kunar provinces in response to Pakistan’s recent air strikes in Kabul and Paktika. The operations concluded at midnight.Earlier in the week, Afghan authorities accused Pakistan of bombing the capital, Kabul, and a market in the country’s east. Pakistan did not claim responsibility for the assault.1. The violence began when Taliban forces allegedly opened fire on several Pakistani border posts late Saturday.2. The firing took place at several key posts, including Angoor Adda, Bajaur, Kurram, Dir, Chitral in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Baramcha in Balochistan, The Express Tribune reported, as cited by the news agency ANI.3. Pakistan Security sources said that the firing was aimed at facilitating the illegal entry of Khwarij -- the state-designated term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) -- into Pakistani territory, as reported by The Express Tribune.4, ""The counteroffensive effectively targeted and destroyed multiple Afghan posts at border. Dozens of Afghan soldiers and Khwarij were killed in retaliatory fire,"" news agency ANI reported, citing Express Tribune.5. Pakistani Minister of Interior Mohsin Naqvi called the Afghan attacks ""unprovoked"" and said that Pakistani forces were responding ""with a stone for every brick"". ""Firing by Afghan forces on civilian population is a blatant violation of international laws. Pakistan’s brave forces have given a prompt and effective response that no provocation will be tolerated,"" he said in a post on X.Also read: Clashes break out between Pak army & Taliban along border 6. Afghanistan’s Taliban forces said they launched armed reprisals against Pakistani soldiers along the border, accusing Islamabad of air strikes on their soil.7. ""In retaliation for air strikes carried out by the Pakistani army on Kabul,"" Taliban forces are engaged ""in heavy clashes against Pakistani security forces in various areas"" along the border, the Afghan military said in a statement, as citeb by AFP.8. Later, Taliban defence ministry spokesman Enayat Khowarazm told news agency AFP the ""successful"" operations had ended at midnight. But he warned: ""If the opposing side violates Afghanistan's territory again, our armed forces are ready to defend their territory and will respond firmly.""9. Pakistan did not acknowledge carrying out Thursday's attacks but urged Kabul ""to stop harbouring the Pakistani Taliban (TTP) on its soil.""10. The TTP, which has received combat training in Afghanistan and shares the Afghan Taliban’s ideology, is accused by Pakistan of killing hundreds of its soldiers since 2021.The heightened tensions from Pakistan come as Afghanistan’s foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, is on a week-long visit to India, marking the first high-level trip from Kabul since the Taliban took power in August 2021.","Fifteen Pakistani soldiers were killed in a ""retaliatory"" operation by Afghan forces in Helmand province on Saturday night.

Katy Perry’s Secret Admirer? Justin Trudeau’s Passionate Singalong Ignites Speculation

About the yacht photo



'Katy is very interested in him'







Canada's former prime minister Justin Trudeau faced vicious trolling after Daily Mail published a zoomed-in photo of a shirtless Trudeau kissing Katy Perry on board Katy Perry's 24-metre yacht, the Caravelle, off the coast of Santa Barbara, California. Social media users questioned whether Trudeau has left Canada like he left his family and spends most of the time in the US now, as he has been said to be dating Katy Perry for months now.""What kind of guy @JustinTrudeau is? He is not sincere to his wife and kids even. Leave the country which he left in tatters. Shameless,"" one wrote.""Justin Trudeau and Katy Perry. One pretended to be an astronaut. One pretended to be a Prime Minister,"" another wrote, taking a swipe at Katy Perry's space tour on Blue Origin.""To all of you who voted the liberals in, how ya feeling now? He doesn’t give a sh** about Canada,"" one commented about Trudeau.Trudeau stepped down earlier this year and has been far from politics since then. In 2023, Trudeau split with his wife Sophie ending their 18 years of marriage. They have two sons , Xavier, 18, and Hadrien, 11, and a daughter, Ella-Grace, 16.Trudeau, 53, and Katy Perry, 40, were earlier spotted together in Montreal in July when they were having an intimate dinner at Le Violon restaurant.Katie Perry has a five-year-old daughter, Daisy Dove Bloom, with Pirates of the Caribbean star Orlando Bloom. She was married to comedian Russell Brand from 2010 until 2012.Daily Mail reported that the photos they exclusively published were taken by a passenger on a passing tourist boat in September when Katy Perry was enjoying a brief break from her Lifetimes world tour. The witness said: ""She pulled up her boat next to a small public whale-watching boat, then they started making out. I didn't realise who she was with until I saw the tattoo on the guy's arm and I immediately realised it was Justin Trudeau""Trudeau has a 'Haida raven' tattoo on his upper left arm. The distinctive tattoo is a tribute to an indigenous Canadian people famed for their seamanship and artistry.Neither Katy Perry nor Justin Trudeau commented openly on their relationship after their much-discussed restaurant photo. However, people in their close circle apparently suggested that their relationship at that time was in the very early stages of exploring romance. ""Katy is very, very interested in him. She says he's a real catch, a high-quality guy. She clearly likes him a lot. He likes her a lot,"" a source told the Daily Mail.","Daily Mail published a zoomed-in photo of a shirtless Justin Trudeau kissing Katy Perry on board Katy Perry's 24-metre yacht, the Caravelle, off the coast of Santa Barbara, California.

Rapid health decline and fatal complications following cosmetic procedure



Legal battle and allegations raise concerns over cosmetic procedure oversight







Brazilian social media influencer Adair Mendes Dutra Junior, widely known as Junior Dutra, has died at the age of 31 following severe, unexpected complications from a cosmetic procedure. Known for his vibrant social media presence, creative lifestyle content, and engaging personality, Junior had gained a large, loyal following on Instagram. His untimely death has sent shockwaves through the Brazilian beauty community, social media circles, and among his over 100,000 devoted followers, many of whom expressed grief, disbelief, and heartbreak across multiple platforms.The tragedy unfolded after he underwent a popular cosmetic procedure called the “fox eyes” surgery, which aims to lift, reshape, and elongate the outer corners of the eyes for a more striking, model-like appearance. What was intended as a simple beauty enhancement turned fatal, tragically highlighting the potential risks, hidden dangers, and lack of regulation surrounding trendy cosmetic procedures increasingly sought after by influencers worldwide.Junior Dutra reportedly underwent the fox eyes procedure in March, performed by celebrity dentist Fernando Simionato Garbi. The influencer had publicly shared videos documenting the procedure, later revealing significant swelling, bruising, and redness around his eyes.Following the treatment, Junior developed a serious infection, which persisted despite dermatological care. In an interview with Brazilian outlet Feed TV, just a month before his death, he shared his deteriorating health: “I didn’t expect it to get this bad.” He described frequent hospital visits as he struggled to recover from post-procedure complications.This situation underscores a critical point: even procedures that appear minimally invasive or cosmetic can carry severe health risks if complications arise.The fox eyes or cat eyes surgery has surged in popularity in recent years, inspired by celebrities like Bella Hadid and Kendall Jenner. The procedure is designed to create an almond-shaped, lifted eye by raising the outer corners, giving a youthful and striking appearance.According to the American Board of Cosmetic Surgery (ABCS), several methods can achieve this look, including:Despite their popularity, these treatments are not risk-free. The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) warns that complications can include:The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also cautioned against the use of PDO threads for eyebrow or eyelid lifts, noting potential for permanent disfigurement, severe swelling, and long-lasting pain.Medical experts emphasise the importance of monitoring for early warning signs of complications. Post-procedure symptoms that should not be ignored include:To minimise risks, specialists recommend:Junior Dutra’s health reportedly worsened rapidly in his final days. His close friend Gean Souza told Brazilian magazine Quem that he began experiencing shortness of breath and extreme weakness. As reported by The US Sun, on October 3, Junior was rushed to a public hospital in São Paulo after severe respiratory distress. Despite emergency care, he could not be saved. His sudden passing left fans and the online beauty community in shock, illustrating how quickly post-procedure complications can escalate.Adding further complexity to the tragedy, Junior had filed a police complaint prior to his death. Legal documents obtained by Brazilian outlet Portland Leo Dias reveal that Junior accused Garbi of performing medical procedures outside his professional license and impersonating a doctor. The complaint included charges of illegal medical practice, fraud, and causing serious bodily harm. Junior had also requested an official investigation by the 15th Police District of São Paulo.Garbi, through legal representatives, denied any wrongdoing and maintained that his procedures were performed legally and safely under proper supervision. The case highlights the need for stronger regulatory oversight in cosmetic procedures, particularly those fueled by social media trends.","Brazilian social media influencer Adair Mendes Dutra Junior, widely known as Junior Dutra, has died at the age of 31 following severe, unexpected complications from a cosmetic procedure.

Trump undecided on providing Tomahawks to Ukraine



Russian concern over Tomahawks



Russia 'continues aerial terror,' says Zelenskyy







As Ukraine faces continued air attacks against its energy infrastructure from Russia, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday renewed efforts to increase his country's air defenses in talks with US President Donald Trump Zelenskyy wrote on X that the two leaders also discussed ""details related to the energy sector.""Their call followed an earlier conversation on Saturday, Zelenskyy said, during which the two leaders agreed on Sunday's topics.The phone calls followed Zelenskyy's statement on Friday that he was in discussions with US officials regarding the possible provision of various long-range precision strike weapons, including Tomahawks and additional ATACMS tactical ballistic missiles.Trump said earlier this week that he has ""sort of made a decision"" on whether to send Tomahawks to Ukraine.But the US president also said that before agreeing to provide Tomahawks, he wanted to know how Kyiv would use the weapons because he did not want to escalate the war.A senior Ukrainian delegation is set to visit the United States in the coming days.Moscow also expressed ""extreme concern"" over Washington potentially providing Tomahawks to aid Ukraine as it continues to try to fend off Moscow's full-scale invasion.Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said ""the topic of Tomahawks is of extreme concern.""""Now is really a very dramatic moment in terms of the fact that tensions are escalating from all sides,"" he told Russian state television.Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin , also said in comments released Sunday that he doubts that Washington will provide Ukraine with the cruise missiles.""I think we need to calm down in this regard. Our friend Donald... sometimes he takes a more forceful approach, and then, his tactic is to let go a little and step back. Therefore, we shouldn't take this literally, as if it's going to fly tomorrow,"" Lukashenko posted on his Telegram.Meanwhile, Russia attacked Ukraine's power grid overnight into Sunday, part of an ongoing campaign to cripple Ukrainian energy infrastructure before winter.Kyiv regional governor Mykola Kalashnyk said two employees of Ukraine's largest private energy company, DTEK, were injured in the attack on a substation. Ukraine's energy ministry said key infrastructure was also targeted in the regions of Donetsk, Odesa and Chernihiv.""Russia continues its aerial terror against our cities and communities, intensifying strikes on our energy infrastructure,"" Zelenskyy posted on X, noting that Russia had launched ""more than 3,100 drones, 92 missiles, and around 1,360 glide bombs"" over the past week.Zelenskyy called for tighter secondary sanctions on buyers of Russian oil, ""Sanctions, tariffs, and joint actions against the buyers of Russian oil, those who finance this war, must all remain on the table.""","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy renewed efforts to increase his country's air defenses in talks with US President Donald Trump.

As the middle peace deal is holding up for the fourth day, Hamas is set to release all the surviving hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.This comes as US President Donald Trump is making a flash visit to the region for the peace summit and to celebrate his role in brokering last week's ceasefire and hostage release deal.As per Trump's deal, Israel will begin releasing around 2,000 Gaza detainees after Hamas have handed over surviving 20 hostages.

I think people are tired of it. It's been centuries,"" Trump said.""The war is over. Okay?

Protesters clash with police in Ecuador amid nationwide strike over fuel prices,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/protesters-clash-with-police-in-ecuador-amid-nationwide-strike-over-fuel-prices/articleshow/124515114.cms,"Demonstrators protest President Daniel Noboa's government (Image credits: AP)





QUITO: Crowds protesting a spike in fuel prices spilled into the streets of Ecuador's capital of Quito Sunday, burning tires, blocking roads and facing off against police officers who responded with volleys of tear gas.It was the latest confrontation in a series of nationwide demonstrations testing President Daniel Noboa.Protesters on Sunday whistled and chanted ""Noboa out, out!"" as they marched from southern Quito toward a park further north. Before they could reach the plaza, police officers on motorbikes dispersed the rally, firing tear gas into the crowd. No injuries were immediately reported.Ecuador's largest indigenous organisation called the strikes 21 days ago in response to the removal of a fuel subsidy that raised the price of diesel from $1.80 per gallon to $2.80.The protests have frequently turned violent, with one civilian reported killed so far, dozens injured and over a hundred arrested in clashes with police.Noboa has imposed a state of emergency in 10 provinces, restricting public gatherings in Quito and other areas. Last week, protesters attacked Noboa's motorcade with rocks in a major escalation.As the protests have been largely concentrated in the country's northern provinces, Sunday's rally in Quito put authorities on high alert.Thousands of police in riot gear streamed into the capital in recent days.The latest demonstration coincided with the Day of Interculturality and Plurinationality, Ecuador's replacement for Columbus Day that recognises its indigenous population rather than the Italian explorer's arrival in the Americas in 1492.The hike in fuel prices particularly affects indigenous people who work in Ecuador's crucial agricultural, fishing and transport sectors.President Noboa argues that the government needed to slash the $1.1 billion subsidy to shore up the country's finances and combat rampant fuel smuggling across Ecuador's borders into Colombia and Peru.But the measures drew widespread anger.""The different social sectors, indigenous movement, workers, youth, neighborhoods of Quito, peoples of Ecuador, we are rising up against the neoliberal and hunger-inducing policies of the dictator Noboa,"" Nelson Erazo, a union leader at Sunday's rally, told The Associated Press, referring to the government's subsidy removal and Noboa's other recent cost-cutting measures, like dismissal of thousands of public workers.Noboa has toured several restive regions and provided bonuses to cash-strapped farmers and public transport workers. But he has refused to negotiate with the indigenous federation.","Crowds protest a spike in fuel prices in Ecuador's capital of Quito.

'No Boots On Ground...': Vance Clarifies '200 U.S Troops In Israel' Plan To Monitor Gaza Ceasefire





In a rare moment of bipartisanship, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has praised President Donald Trump for his role in brokering a historic Gaza peace deal that aims to end the two-year war in the region.“I really commend President Trump and his administration,” Clinton said in an interview with CBS News 24/7 on Friday. She also lauded the 20-point peace plan that secured commitments from regional Arab leaders.“Let’s now support this process and bring it together, not just in a nonpartisan way in our own country, but literally internationally as a great global commitment to try to bring peace, security, stability and a better future to the Middle East,” she added.Clinton’s remarks came a day after Hamas agreed to Trump’s peace proposal in a breakthrough move that drew praise from both Gaza and Israel.The deal provides for the release of the remaining 48 Israeli hostages as early as Monday, alongside a staged withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. Hamas is set to disarm and a transitional international body will govern the territory during the reconstruction phase, according to New York Post.The former Democratic presidential candidate, who had long advocated a two-state solution during her tenure under then President Barack Obama , urged the Trump administration to ensure that all parties honor the deal.Clinton also credited Trump’s diplomatic efforts, particularly his ability to bring Israel back to the negotiating table after the September peace talk clashes in Qatar as a key turning point.“That provided an opening for both President Trump and his representatives to marshal all of the regional powers, including, of course, Qatar, but also to make it clear to Israel, ‘No, this is now enough. We cannot continue this. This conflict needs to end,’” she said.Clinton’s commendation follows her earlier comment that she would nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize if he managed to end the Russia-Ukraine war without forcing Kyiv to cede territory to Moscow.“Honestly, if he could bring about the end to this terrible war, if he could end it without putting Ukraine in a position where it had to concede its territory to the aggressor, could really stand up to Putin, something we haven’t seen, but maybe this is the opportunity, if President Trump were the architect of that, I’d nominate him for a Nobel Peace Prize,” she had said on the Raging Moderates podcast.At the time, Trump reacted warmly to her statement, saying, “Well, uh, that was very nice… I may have to start liking her again.”Clinton is not alone among Democrats recognizing Trump’s recent diplomatic success. Jake Sullivan, former national security adviser under former President Joe Biden , admitted the deal “finally brings an end to what felt like an unending conflict.”Even former President Barack Obama congratulated the parties involved, though notably without naming Trump in his post on X.Meanwhile, Trump on Sunday departed for a visit to Israel and Egypt, calling it a “very special” trip marking “a historic moment for peace.”He is expected to attend a joint ceremony celebrating the ceasefire and hostage release and to co-chair the Gaza Peace Summit with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.","Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has praised President Donald Trump for his role in brokering a historic Gaza peace deal.

US President Donald Trump on Sunday made a candid remark about his spiritual prospects while speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One as he departed for Egypt to attend a peace summit. “I don’t think I’m going to heaven,” Trump said.The reporter had asked the US President about his earlier comments linking efforts to end the war in Ukraine to his hope of reaching heaven, saying, “You talked about how you hoped to end the war in Ukraine because it might help you get into heaven.”To this, Trump replied, “I don’t think there’s anything going to get me in heaven. I think I’m not maybe heaven bound. I may be in heaven right now as we fly in Air Force One, I’m not sure. I’m going to be able to make heaven. But I’ve made life a lot better for a lot of people.”Earlier, Trump had openly reflected on his desire to reach heaven, linking it to his efforts to end the war in Ukraine. In an interview with Fox & Friends, he said, “I want to try and get to heaven, if possible. I’m hearing I’m not doing well. I am really at the bottom of the totem pole. But if I can get to heaven, this will be one of the reasons.”Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt later confirmed, “I think the president was serious. I think the president wants to get to heaven—as I hope we all do in this room as well.”Trump has also spoken about his parents and personal life in the context of mortality. “My father lived a long time, my mother lived a long time, and they were happy, and they were great. So maybe we’re going to live a long time. I hope so,” he said.Following his conviction on 34 felony counts, he told supporters, “Now my beautiful parents are up in heaven, I think they are. They're up there, looking down. They say, 'How did this happen to my son?’”At a rally in Madison Square Garden in October, he added, “I know my mother's in heaven. I'm not 100% sure about my father, but it's close.”On Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke with Trump, urging him to broker a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia, similar to the ceasefire Trump helped secure between Israel and Hamas.In a post on X, Zelenskyy said, “I had a call with US President Donald Trump—a very positive and productive one. I congratulated POTUS on his success and the Middle East deal he was able to secure, which is an outstanding achievement. If a war can be stopped in one region, then surely other wars can be stopped as well—including the Russian war.”Trump described his phone call with Zelenskyy as “very productive,” highlighting that they discussed strengthening Ukraine’s air defense, resilience and long-range capabilities, along with energy sector concerns. He emphasized the importance of peace, saying, “I really think Putin would look great if he got this settled. It’s not going to be good for him if not.”On Sunday, Trump also warned Russia that he could send long-range Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine if Moscow does not settle the ongoing conflict.“I might say, ‘Look: if this war is not going to get settled, I’m going to send them Tomahawks,’” he said. “The Tomahawk is an incredible weapon, very offensive weapon. And honestly, Russia does not need that.”He added, “We may not, but we may do it. I think it’s appropriate to bring up. Do they want to have Tomahawks going in that direction? I don’t think so.”","US President Donald Trump on Sunday made a candid remark about his spiritual prospects while speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One. “I don’t think there’s anything going to get me in heaven.

PORTLAND: Protesters rallying against the Trump administration in Portland put the city's quirky and irreverent reputation on display Sunday by pedaling through the streets wearing absolutely nothing, or close to it, in an ""emergency"" edition of the annual World Naked Bike Ride.Crowds that have gathered daily and nightly outside the immigration facility in Oregon's largest city in recent days have embraced the absurd, donning inflatable frog, unicorn, axolotl and banana costumes as they face off with federal law enforcement who often deploy tear gas and pepper balls.The bike ride is an annual tradition that usually happens in the summer, but organizers of this weekend's hastily called event said another nude ride was necessary to speak out against President Donald Trump 's attempts to mobilize the National Guard to quell protests.Rider Janene King called the nude ride a ""quintessentially Portland way to protest.""The 51-year-old was naked except for wool socks, a wig and a hat. She sipped hot tea and said she was unbothered by the steady rain and temperatures in the mid-50s (about 12 Celsius).""We definitely do not want troops coming into our city,"" King said.Bike riders made their way through the streets and to the city's US Immigration and Customs Enforcement building.Authorities there ordered people to stay out of the street and protest only on sidewalks or risk being arrested.The city is awaiting the ruling of an appeals court panel on whether Trump can send out the federalized troops after a federal judge on October 5 ordered a temporary hold on deployment.""Joy is a form of protest. Being together with mutual respect and kindness is a form of protest,"" the ride's organizers said on Instagram . ""It's your choice how much or little you wear.""Fewer people were fully naked than usual, likely because of the cool, wet weather, but some still bared it all and rode wearing only bike helmets.Naked bike rides have thronged the streets of Oregon's largest city every year since 2004, often holding up traffic as the crowd cycles through with speakers playing music. Some years have drawn roughly 10,000 riders, according to Portland World Naked Bike Ride.",Naked bike rides have thronged the streets of Oregon's largest city every year since 2004.

Flight delays over the Nor'easter



Guv Phil Murphy is not in New Jersey







New Jersey declared a state of emergency Sunday as heavy rain accompanied by winds up to 60mph is expected to crash through the region as part of the approaching Nor'easter. The winds will persist into Monday afternoon. “The greatest effects are going to be the coastal flooding potential, especially for areas from northeastern North Carolina northward to much of the New Jersey coast,” said meteorologist Bob Oravec with the National Weather Service in College Park, Maryland.The National Weather Service placed New York City under a coastal flood warning and wind advisory through at least Monday afternoon. Coastal areas of suburban Long Island could see flooding, with up to 3 inches (about 8 centimeters) of rain and lashing winds expected, the weather service said.Newark International Airport has delays of around 80 minutes for many flights, with planes headed to the airport from across North America even being ordered by the FAA to hold at their departures, NJ.com reported. JFK International Airport, as well as travel hubs in Boston, Philadelphia and Washington, DC, are also facing similar delays.The Federal Aviation Administration has issued ground delays at several airports due to the nor'easter, with average delays inching toward two hours in some locations.As of 12:35 p.m. Sunday, passengers at Boston Logan International Airport are being told to expect an average delay of 86 minutes due to low ceilings, and 80 minutes for those traveling through Newark Liberty International Airport.Democrat NJ Governor Phil Murphy was not in New Jersey when the emergency was declared last night. “In preparation for this storm, I am issuing a State of Emergency for all 21 counties out of an abundance of caution, authorizing our state’s emergency services personnel to activate as necessary,” Acting Governor Way announced in a statement Saturday.","The National Weather Service placed New York City under a coastal flood warning and wind advisory through at least Monday afternoon.

US Vice President JD Vance on Sunday hailed President Donald Trump ’s role in brokering the Gaza peace deal, saying it had united Israel, Gulf Arab nations, and communities across faiths. Vance said the release of the remaining Israeli hostages held by Hamas was imminent and credited the US administration for making it possible.“It really should be any moment now,” Vance told NBC’s Meet the Press when asked about the timing for the release. On ABC’s This Week, he added, “We expect to see them alive here in the next 24 hours, probably early tomorrow morning, US time, which will be later in the day, of course, in Israel.”In a post on X, Vance said, “It’s an amazing thing… We should be proud of this team, we should be proud of our country, because these hostages are going to live their lives thanks to what the United States of America did.”He added, “Muslims and Jews and Christians all seem unified that it’s a really good thing for the world… and it happened because of President Trump’s leadership. If we can build a sustainable peace, I’m 100% sure Americans will be safer because of it.”Calling it a “great morning,” the vice president said the hostages should be at home “in the next 24 hours.”Vance’s press secretary, Taylor Van Kirk, quoted him as saying, “The lesson here is that Donald Trump refused to go down the failed, traditional diplomatic pathway.He cut his own Trump diplomatic pathway, and because of that, it was successful.”Vance also clarified that the US does not plan to deploy troops in Gaza. “We already have troops at central command… They are going to monitor the terms of the ceasefire... The idea that we're going to have troops on the ground in Gaza, in Israel, that is NOT our intention - that is not our plan. There was a bit of misreporting there,” he said.Describing the deal as a “remarkable achievement”, Vance reposted, “This is a remarkable achievement from an administration that really chose a nonconventional path to diplomacy... these 20 hostages are going to come home to their families... It’s a great thing, and I’m very excited about it. It shows what happens when you go outside the traditional, failed diplomatic roots and actually try something new.”Vance further praised Trump for uniting Israel and Gulf Arab states for a shared objective. “Trump has done something that no other world leader has been able to do: unite the Israelis with the Gulf Arab states for a common objective... to bring the hostages home, to stop the war, and to build the kind of long-term settlement that... can bring a lasting peace,” he said.Meanwhile, Al Jazeera reported that bulldozers have begun clearing rubble in Gaza City after two years of war, as tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians return to their devastated homes in northern Gaza. Preparations are underway for a Gaza ceasefire summit in Egypt’s Sharm el-Sheikh, where Trump is expected to attend.According to Al Jazeera, the conflict has killed at least 67,806 people and wounded 170,066 since October 2023. A total of 1,139 people were killed in Israel during the October 7, 2023, attacks, and about 200 were taken captive.",US Vice President JD Vance hailed President Donald Trump's role in brokering the Gaza peace deal.

"US CDC layoff: Hundreds reinstated as ‘incorrect notification’ fired them, after Donald Trump’s vow to ‘fire Democrats-aligned workers’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-cdc-layoff-hundreds-reinstated-as-incorrect-notification-fired-them-after-donadl-trumps-vow-to-fire-democrats-aligned-workers/articleshow/124505419.cms,"CDC (left), Donald Trump (agencies)





Hundreds of employees at the US centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) who were laid off on Friday night have been reinstated, after officials said the terminations were triggered by an “incorrect notification,” reported CNN.According to the American federation of government employees (AFGE), around 1,300 CDC staff received layoff notices late Friday, but roughly 700 were reinstated on Saturday after the agency discovered an error, while about 600 remain laid off.“The employees who received incorrect notifications were never separated from the agency and have all been notified that they are not subject to the reduction in force,” said Andrew Nixon, communications director for the US department of health and human services (HHS), as quoted by the news outlet.Among those reinstated were staff linked to the CDC’s morbidity and mortality weekly report, according to Dr Debra Houry, who recently resigned as the agency’s chief medical officer and deputy director. Houry and several senior officials had stepped down earlier in protest after the firing of recently confirmed CDC director Dr Susan Monarez.Athalia Christie, the CDC’s incident commander for the measles response, was also among those mistakenly terminated.The US has reported 1,563 measles cases since January, the highest number since the disease was declared eliminated 25 years ago.Employees reinstated include personnel from the national center for immunization and respiratory diseases, the global health center, and the public health infrastructure center, which manages more than $3 billion in grants for state and local health programs, said Dr Brian Castrucci, president of the de Beaumont Foundation, a nonprofit focused on public health workers.Officers from the CDC’s epidemic intelligence service (EIS) - known as “disease detectives” - were also mistakenly let go. A CDC official told reporters that “we think all staff and all officers are back,” noting the issue stemmed from a coding error in the layoff notices.However, workers from the CDC’s Washington office, violence prevention programmes, and the Office of the director of the injury center remain separated from the agency under the latest phase of the Trump administration’s reduction in force (RIF) initiative.Speaking late Friday, US President Donald Trump said he planned to fire “a lot” of federal workers, vowing to target those he claimed were aligned with the Democratic party.“We figure they started this thing, so they should be Democrat-oriented,” Trump said, blaming Democrats for the ongoing government shutdown. Trump did not provide details on what qualified the affected workers as “Democrat-oriented.”The legality of firing federal employees during a shutdown has been challenged in court. After the office of management and budget director Russell Vought posted “The RIFs have begun” on X, AFGE replied, “The lawsuit has been filed.”A court filing said more than 4,100 federal workers were affected across HHS, commerce, education, energy, housing and urban development, homeland security, and treasury departments.","1,300 CDC staff received layoff notices late Friday, but roughly 700 were reinstated on Saturday after the agency discovered an error.

Retaliatory Strike by Afghan Forces Kills 15 Pakistani Soldiers; Qatar Calls for Dialogue





NEW DELHI: Former Indian diplomat KP Fabian on Sunday described Pakistan’s foreign policy as a “failure” following its recent confrontation with Afghanistan, where Islamabad has been accused of carrying out strikes on Afghan territory.Speaking to news agency ANI, Fabian said Pakistan had acted as an aggressor and “played its hand badly,” resulting in deteriorating relations with Kabul.“This has happened when, maybe coincidentally, the Afghanistan Emirate foreign minister is in Delhi,” Fabian said, as per ANI.“The bad relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan cannot entirely be explained on the basis of the Durand Line. I think Pakistan played its hand badly, probably was overbearing. The proud Afghans resisted, and now the relationship is very bad,” he said.Fabian noted that Pakistan had carried out strikes on Kabul, prompting Afghanistan’s retaliation.“On the whole, Pakistani policy has been, more or less, a failure... It is abundantly clear that Afghanistan is keen on developing relations with India, which is the case with India too, and Pakistan is naturally upset,” he added.The Afghan ministry of defence has recently said that the armed forces of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan conducted “successful retaliatory operations” against Pakistani military positions along the Durand Line late Saturday night.In a statement cited by ANI, the ministry said the strikes were “in response to repeated violations of Afghanistan’s sovereignty by the Pakistani military and airstrikes on its territory.”According to news agency Associated Press (AP), Afghanistan claimed on Sunday that its forces had killed 58 Pakistani soldiers and captured 25 military posts in overnight operations along the border.Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said Afghan forces were in control of the “official borders and de facto lines,” though Pakistan has not confirmed any casualties.Both the Torkham and Chaman border crossings remained closed on Sunday following the escalation. Pakistan, for its part, accused Afghan authorities of harbouring militants of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a charge Kabul has denied.Tensions between the two countries have worsened in recent months, with frequent border skirmishes and airstrikes deepening distrust. Saudi Arabia has called for “restraint and dialogue” to prevent further escalation in the region.","Former Indian diplomat KP Fabian on Sunday described Pakistan’s foreign policy as a “failure” following its recent confrontation with Afghanistan.

Pakistan Panics After Taliban Issues Warning, Accuses India of Using Afghanistan Soil for Terror





Pakistan has lodged formal objections with Afghanistan’s Ambassador in Islamabad over several ‘elements of the India‑Afghanistan joint statement’, particularly the reference to Jammu and Kashmir as 'part of India'.It also rejected remarks by Afghan foreign minister Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi that “terrorism is an internal problem of Pakistan,” the Pakistani ministry of foreign affairs (MOFA) said.The foreign office said: “It was conveyed that the reference to Jammu and Kashmir as part of India is in clear violation of the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and the legal status of Jammu and Kashmir. The Joint Statement is highly insensitive to the sacrifices and sentiments of the people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir in their just struggle for the right to self‑determination.”In addition, Islamabad strongly rebutted Muttaqi’s claim, saying: “Pakistan has repeatedly shared details regarding the presence of Fitna‑e‑Khawarij and Fitna‑e‑Hindustan terrorist elements operating from Afghan soil against Pakistan with support from elements within Afghanistan.”The Pakistani statement added that deflecting responsibility by branding terrorism in Pakistan as an ""internal matter"" does not relieve Afghanistan’s interim government of its duty to ensure regional peace and security.It also urged that “unauthorised Afghan nationals residing in Pakistan” return to their country.These protests follow a joint statement issued on October 10 during Muttaqi’s visit to India, where both nations reiterated condemnation of terrorism emanating from regional countries, affirmed respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, and affirmed that the Afghan government would not permit any group or individual to use Afghan territory against India.In that statement, external affairs minister S Jaishankar expressed gratitude for Afghanistan’s condemnation of the April 22 terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu & Kashmir, while Afghanistan reaffirmed its support in counterterrorism.""Both sides emphasised respect for each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The external affairs minister appreciated the Afghan side's understanding of India's security concerns. The Afghan foreign minister reiterated the commitment that the Afghan government will not allow any group or individual to use the territory of Afghanistan against India,"" the statement issued by the ministry of external affairs (MEA) read.Muttaqi is on a week-long visit to India (October 9–16), the first such high-level visit since the Taliban takeover in 2021. Earlier, he said the “future of India‑Afghanistan relations seems very bright.”",Pakistan has lodged formal objections with Afghanistan’s Ambassador in Islamabad over several ‘elements of the India‑Afghanistan joint statement’ It also rejected remarks by Afghan foreign minister Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi that “terrorism is an internal problem of Pakistan’,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124491584,imgsize-1282370,width-400,resizemode-4/shehbaz-sharif-left-amir-muttaqi-and-s-jaishankar-file-agencies.jpg"

Government response and TLP’s history





Massive protests by the hardline Islamist groupescalated into violent clashes across multiple cities on Friday and Saturday, leaving at least 11 people dead and dozens injured. Demonstrators marched towards Islamabad in what they called a “Gaza March” to express solidarity with Palestinians and planned to stage a protest outside the United States embassy.TLP launched its protests in Lahore on Thursday, announcing plans to march to the US embassy in Islamabad to oppose the US-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas following two years of conflict in Gaza. While the demonstrations were initially organised to challenge the ceasefire, the party said the focus had shifted to expressing solidarity with Palestinians.“We have no demands other than showing solidarity with the people of Gaza,” senior TLP member Allama Muhammad Irfan told AFP as the protesters set off for Islamabad.The rally, led by TLP chief Saad Rizvi, began after Friday prayers from the party’s base on Multan Road in Lahore. Thousands joined, chanting religious slogans and carrying sticks and rods. Police set up barricades and used tear gas at key junctions — including Yateem Khana Chowk, Chauburji, Azadi Chowk, and Shahdara — but protesters broke through, clashing with security forces and pelting stones.Videos on social media showed demonstrators seizing government vehicles and damaging public property.Violence soon spread to Islamabad and Rawalpindi, where authorities placed shipping containers to block roads and fired tear gas to disperse crowds. In return, protesters hurled stones at police. Public life in the twin cities was severely disrupted, with schools shut, the Metro bus service suspended, and mobile internet blocked for a second consecutive day.According to Arab News, TLP claimed that 11 of its supporters had been killed and 50 injured since Thursday, though officials have not commented on the claim. Lahore police confirmed multiple injuries among officers and said more than 100 TLP activists had been arrested for attacking law enforcement and damaging property.Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi warned that no group would be allowed to march on Islamabad “under any circumstances,” while State Minister for Interior Talal Chaudhry accused the TLP of “political blackmail” and misusing religious sentiments. “Peaceful protest is a democratic right,” Chaudhry said, “but there is no room for violence or mob pressure.”Founded in 2015, the TLP has a history of staging disruptive protests on religious and political issues. Since its rise in 2017, the group has repeatedly brought parts of Pakistan to a standstill through mass marches and sit-ins that have paralyzed the capital and major highways for days.",Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) launched protests in Lahore on Thursday.
