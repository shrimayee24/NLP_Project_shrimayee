GHAZIABAD: Like many others, Dhanveer Singh Negi (57) stopped when he saw a crowd gathered on a culvert. But he was the only one to jump into the opaque waters of the canal running below and drag to safety a man who was about to drown.""I'm a soldier. I can't watch anyone die in front of my eyes,"" the ex-Navyman told TOI on Wednesday of his plunge into the Hindon canal on Monday afternoon when a young man thrashed around to stay afloat, his father cried plaintively on the banks and onlookers captured it all on their cellphone cameras.Negi, a former petty officer with the Navy 's marine commandos (Marcos), wasn't the youngest in the crowd but parked his scooter and jumped in immediately.I saw people taking videos and pictures, but no one had the courage to save the boy. Probably, they didn't know how to swim,"" he said.It's some of these videos that would tell the tale of Singh's rescue act to the wider world, drawing lavish praise on social media. The 18-year-old youth who Negi saved had, according to witnesses, jumped into the canal near Gaur Green Avenue in Indirapuram after an argument with his father, who drives an e-rickshaw for a living.Negi, who lives in Indirapuram, was returning home. It was around 4.30pm when he spotted the man in the canal.Originally from Pauri Garhwal, Negi completed high school in 1985 and moved to Mumbai to join the Navy as a technical support specialist (electrical). His training took place at Mandvi, Goa. After a year, he went aboard a ship.""I learned underwater diving skills and afterward joined Marcos. Currently, I am a trainer at a merchant navy institute in Sector 1 in Noida,"" said Negi, who retired on July 31, 2000.""When I took the boy out of water, I also gave him CPR. After that, some people stopped an e-rickshaw and put the boy into it to take him to a hospital for treatment. I don't know him, and I didn't try to get to know him. I learned during my Navy training that soldiers work to only save people and move forward. I did the same,"" he added.One video of 35 seconds shows Negi getting into the water. Another shows him pulling the youth to the banks and getting out. The person recording the video asks him his name and he replies that he is D S Negi, a local resident. The father of the youth, meanwhile, thanks Negi with folded hands.Manan Bhatt, a Navy veteran, heaped praise on Negi, saying his act demonstrated that heroism and service transcend retirement. ""Negi's act of courage extended beyond the rescued man. It serves as a powerful reminder to society that age and profession are no barriers to service and valour.

A corporate litigator at a prestigious law firm in San Francisco, has clerked for Chief Justice John Roberts of the Supreme Court , as well as for Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his tenure as an appeals court judge.Raised in a suburb of San Diego, California, Usha's upbringing emphasised education and hard work.

Their wedding included a Hindu priest presiding over a separate ceremony. The couple has three children together.Usha Vance has been instrumental in her husband's political success. She played a key role in helping JD Vance organise his thoughts on the social decline in rural white America, which inspired his best-selling memoir, ""Hillbilly Elegy."" The memoir was adapted into a film directed by Ron Howard in 2020.In the past, Usha has made some rare public appearances alongside JD Vance during his campaign from the Ohio Senate seat.As the US presidential elections approach, former President Donald Trump announced JD Vance as his Vice Presidential pick. Trump confirmed Vance's candidacy through a social media post.""Usha Vance is a highly accomplished attorney and daughter of Indian immigrants—and her husband brings youth and diversity to the Trump ticket,"" said AI Mason, a US-based global real estate investment advisor and entrepreneur, speaking to ANI.

Everything he says and does is built on a foundation of so much thought. He's always trying to do better,"" said Usha Vance.On supporting her husband, Usha told Fox, ""There are a few different reasons...One is that I grew up in a religious household. My parents are Hindu, and that was one of the things that made them such good parents, that makes them really very good people.

Raised by his grandparents, Vance's challenging early life shaped his perspectives.The Trump campaign has stated that following his near-death experience, the former president will focus on calling for unity in times of tragedy, instead of criticising his political adversaries. This approach will be pivotal as he faces off against President Biden in the 2024 election rematch.","Usha Chilukuri Vance is the wife of J D Vance, who was recently announced as Donald Trump's vice presidential pick for the upcoming US elections.

The forces fired more than 2,000 rounds during the gunfight - one of the most intense in recent decades against Maoist insurgents.The operation was a blow for PLGA in north Gadchiroli as its divisional committee member and Tippagarh dalam chief Laxman Atram, the commander of PLGA in the region, was killed.Sarita Parsa, a woman Maoist and Chatgaon committee member, was among the deceased.The Maoist death count is likely to increase as another body is suspected to be lying somewhere in the jungle.

TOI

CHENNAI: Exposing more tentacles of the gold smuggling racket at Chennai airport , government has suspended an undisclosed number of immigration officials for their suspected links with the smugglers .A top Intelligence Bureau official said three of the officials had been placed under suspension. But airport sources toldthat many more officers have faced action.“The number is being under-reported to avoid scrutiny of the immigration section by other agencies such as Directorate of Revenue intelligence (DRI) and Customs ,” an official said.The charge against the suspended personnel is that, for a cut from the smugglers, they collected gold from carriers arriving at the airport and sneaked it outside to receivers. They are also accused of allowing flyers through without scrutinising passports and other documents properly.An IB officer, who did not wish to be identified, said the nexus of the three officers with gold smugglers was being probed. One of them is Saravanan, who was on deputation to the IB. The officer refused to name the other two. “Action is being taken for the charges against them as mentioned in the memo,” he said.The officer said the suspension procedure was initiated only for internal procedural lapses. “We got intelligence that they allow flyers without verification of documents under the Emigration Check Not Required (ECNR) category. How long they have been doing this and the money trail are being probed. If their involvement in gold smuggling had been proved, they would have been booked by now,” he said.The officer said the suspension orders were issued before Customs busted a cartel that smuggled in 267kg gold, worth about Rs 167 crore, in about two months. They used a souvenir shop as a front at the international terminal.Officials said they have detected similar offences in the past and suspended erring personnel. At least 45 immigration personnel, including many state police personnel on deputation to IB, are deployed at the airport for clearing international passengers.","Officials accused of allowing flyers through without scrutinising passports and other documents properly.

Usha Chilukuri Vance took centre stage at the Republican National Convention on Thursday to introduce her husband, JD Vance , as Donald Trump 's running mate for the upcoming US presidential election.In her speech at the RNC, Usha shared their story, detailing how they first met and the journey that led them to this significant occasion where JP Vance stands as Donald Trump's Vice President running mate.She described JD as a working-class individual who overcame childhood traumas to attend Yale Law School with the support of the G.I. Bill.""When I was asked to introduce my husband, JD Vance, to all of you, I was at a loss. It occurred to me that there was only one thing to do: to explain, from the heart, why I love and admire JD, why I stand here beside him today, and why he will make a great Vice President of the United States,"" Usha said.She continued, ""I met JD in law school when he was fresh out of Ohio State, which he attended with the support of the G.I. Bill. He was then, as now, the most interesting person I knew. A working-class guy who had overcome childhood traumas that I could barely fathom to end up at Yale Law School. A tough Marine who had served in Iraq, but whose idea of a good time was playing with puppies.""She also went on to describe her husband as the meat and potatoes guy who learned to cook Indian food for her and her mother.""Although he's a meat and potatoes kinda guy. He adapted to my vegetarian diet & learned to cook food from my mother. Indian food. before I knew it. he'd become an integral part of my family.

He credited his grandmother, affectionately called ""Mamaw,"" for his achievements and described her as ""tough as nails. He shared an anecdote about her threatening to run over a local drug-dealing boy with her car if Vance continued to associate with him.Vance's selection and transformation position him as a potential future leader of the Republican Party and the torchbearer of Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" political movement, which has significantly reshaped the GOP and upended long-standing political norms.As the first millennial to be part of a major party ticket's top tier, Vance enters the race at a time when voters are increasingly concerned about the advanced age of the leading candidates, with Trump being 78 and Biden 81 years old.","Usha Chilukuri Vance introduced her husband, JD Vance, as Donald Trump's running mate for the upcoming US presidential election.

The space rock passed through the atmosphere over the Big Apple around 11:15am, coinciding with reports from New Yorkers who saw a flash of fire streak across the sky and felt the ground lightly shaking beneath their feet.The ""daylight fireball"" traveled from the Statue of Liberty to Midtown Manhattan around noon. Twenty people across New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut reported seeing the fireball stretch across the sky, with one witness describing the shooting star as illuminated in green, yellow, and white, a New York Post report said.The spectacle lasted about 30 seconds before fragmenting into three pieces, according to an eyewitness report to the American Meteor Society. Nasa’s Meteor Watch estimates that the ""daylight fireball"" was first spotted about 40 miles above New York Harbor’s Upper Bay, where Lady Liberty stands. Moving at a rate of 34,000 miles per hour, ""the meteor descended at a steep angle of just 18 degrees from vertical, passing over the Statue of Liberty before disintegrating 29 miles above midtown Manhattan,"" Nasa wrote in a Facebook post.No meteorites—debris from outer space that hits the Earth’s surface—were produced by the event. Fortunately, there were no reports of damages or injuries related to the meteor, as confirmed by the city’s Office of Emergency Management.Regarding the reported shaking, experts do not believe it was connected to the meteor or any other natural event. The US Geological Survey National Earthquake Information Center received reports of shaking in the northeast New Jersey and Staten Island, New York area but ruled out the possibility of an earthquake. ""An examination of the seismic data in the area showed no evidence of an earthquake,"" the agency stated.""The USGS has no direct evidence of the source of the shaking. Past reports of shaking with no associated seismic signal have had atmospheric origins such as sonic booms or weather-related phenomena."" Nasa suspects the shaking was related to reports of military activity in the area.The sighting of the shooting star coincided with scorching temperatures in the Big Apple on Tuesday, where the mercury reached 100 degrees, feeling more like 110 degrees.","A meteor soared over the Statue of Liberty before disintegrating about 30 miles above Midtown Manhattan on Tuesday morning.

"After attack on Donald Trump, right points finger at females in secret service",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/after-attack-on-donald-trump-right-points-finger-at-females-in-secret-service/articleshow/111817702.cms,"WASHINGTON: In the hours after the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump , a sexist theory explaining how the Secret Service could have allowed such a grave security failure emerged in right-wing circles: It was the fault of incompetent women in his security detail.“Look, I’m not sure about who the individuals are on the individual detail, Secret Service, but I can tell you under this Biden administration, the one thing I’ve seen is massive DEI hires,” Rep.Cory Mills, R-Fla., said on Fox News, referring to diversity, equity and inclusion practices.“And I can tell you when you primarily, when you primarily go after D-E-I,” Mills continued, “you end up with D-I-E.”Benny Johnson, a right-wing commentator, was more blunt in a social media post viewed nearly 9 million times: “Absolute humiliation for this gaggle of female Secret Service Agents,” he wrote in a post that showed the chaotic aftermath of the shooting, adding: “DEI Secret Service make Presidents LESS Safe.”From an overwhelmingly male phalanx of agents guarding Trump that day, these critics pointed out a trio — visibly shorter than their peers and with their hair pulled back in a bun, a ponytail and with hairpins, respectively, as they put themselves in harm’s way to protect the former president — for criticism. Video of their movements, including a moment in which one visibly struggled to holster a weapon, has fueled an outcry among conservatives who have pinned the agency’s failings on its women, suggesting they were only hired to diversify the predominantly male organization.The agency is led by Kimberly Cheatle, the second woman to serve as its director.The Secret Service is under scrutiny for how agents secured the site of the campaign rally and ultimately responded to the shooting, which left Trump injured, a rally attendee killed, and two others severely wounded. It is the latest and most significant episode in a long saga of errors for the agency, which has been plagued in recent years by debauchery, reckless behavior and security failures.No evidence has surfaced that the response of any female agent in Trump’s detail — whose members shielded his body with their own after shots were fired — caused or contributed to the security breakdown.But the fixation on the few who surrounded Trump at Saturday’s rally reflects a larger grievance among some conservatives, who have argued that policies that promote diversity in hiring are inherently unfair and destructive — and, particularly when it comes to organizations such as the military and law enforcement — even dangerous.Among the suggestions made by those who blamed female Secret Service agents for Saturday’s attack: that they were too short; that the agency lowered its testing standards for them; and that women should not be able to serve in the agency at all.“I can’t imagine that a DEI hire from @pepsi would be a bad choice as the head of the Secret Service,” Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., wrote in an apparently sarcastic post on social media. Cheatle served in the Secret Service for 27 years before becoming the senior director of global security at PepsiCo.Conservatives have long argued that codified diversity efforts promote left-wing ideas about gender and race and distract from organizations’ core missions. The GOP-led House has repeatedly passed legislation that would eliminate such initiatives at the Pentagon and other government agencies.“A woke military is a weak military,” is a common refrain among right-wing lawmakers.Cheatle has spoken openly about her efforts to recruit more women into the service, in part to help combat recruitment and retention issues.“I’m very conscious, as I sit in this chair now, of making sure that we need to attract diverse candidates and ensure that we are developing and giving opportunities to everybody in our workforce, and particularly women,” Cheatle said in her first interview after being tapped to lead the agency, with CBS News.The news report said the agency’s goal was to have women make up 30% of recruits by 2030. They currently make up just under one-fourth of the Secret Service’s workforce, according to its website.The video of that interview, published on YouTube, became overrun in the days after the shooting with comments suggesting that neither Cheatle nor the women the agency has hired since are qualified for their jobs.Kym Craven, executive director of the National Association of Women Law Enforcement Executives, said discussions around whether women should serve on a protective detail were a diversion from the important security issues raised by the assassination attempt.“We’ve had critical incidents for centuries with men leading, and there’s never been a question that because of their gender they shouldn’t lead,” Craven said in an interview.“The incident itself will be under review, and the incident will stand for itself,” she continued. “Whether changes needed to be made, mistakes happened — that’s not for me to judge in any way. But the discussion around gender and that because someone is a woman, they should not lead an agency — that conversation just should not be happening at all.”Craven said women who serve in law enforcement agencies are held to the same physical agility and fitness standards men must meet.“There’s not a woman leader that I know of in this profession that’s asking for standards to be lowered or exceptions to be made for women in the field,” she said.Melanie Burkholder worked for six years as a Secret Service special agent, and in 2012 protected political candidates — including Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney — on the campaign trail.Burkholder said in an interview she found the debate over whether women could serve in the agency “ridiculous,” noting that the first female protective agents were sworn in to the Secret Service in 1971.“For us to be having a conversation about whether women add value, or whether women perform or whatever the question is — it’s ridiculous in my opinion to be having it at this point in time,” she said.A spokesperson for the Secret Service did not respond to a request for comment.But when Trump strode onto the floor of the Republican National Convention on Monday night in Milwaukee — his first public appearance since the shooting at his rally — he was flanked by what appeared to be an all-male phalanx of Secret Service agents.","Right-wing critics point out a trio of female Secret Service agents.

Did love for luxe labels & expensive sushi turn ex-CIA analyst into Seoul mole?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-love-for-luxe-labels-expensive-sushi-turn-ex-cia-analyst-into-seoul-mole/articleshow/111817347.cms,"NEW YORK: Sue Mi Terry , a prominent voice on US foreign policy, had a refined palate, a love for top-shelf sushi and a taste for designer labels. She liked coats by Christian Dior, handbags by Bottega Veneta and Louis Vuitton, and Michelin-starred restaurants.And, according to federal prosecutors in Manhattan, she accepted such luxury goods and other gifts in exchange for serving the South Korean government in Seoul.Terry, a former CIA analyst and a senior fellow for Korea studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, is accused in a 31-page indictment released Tuesday of a yearslong effort to assist South Korean spies. The indictment says she even introduced the spies to congressional staff members, an action that she described as “bringing the wolf in.”The charges, which were brought by the US attorney for the Southern District of New York, were part of a concerted push by the Justice Department to combat foreign influence in US affairs, which has produced dozens of prosecutions in recent years. Such cases have been set off by illegal campaign contributions from overseas, covert influence operations and even the bribing of Sen. Bob Menendez, for which he was convicted Tuesday.In Terry’s case, prosecutors say she began operating as a foreign agent in 2013, five years after leaving the CIA. She was first contacted by an intelligence officer posing as a diplomat for the Korean mission to the United Nations in New York City, the indictment said, and in return for her work over the next decade, Terry received handbags, clothing and at least $37,000 in covert payments to the think tank where she was employed at the time.“Despite engaging in extensive activities for and at the direction of” the South Korean government, Terry did not register as a foreign agent with US officials, as required by law, prosecutors said. She faces two counts, one for failing to register under the federal Foreign Agents Registration Act, and the other for conspiring to violate it.In a statement, Lee Wolosky, Terry’s lawyer, said the allegations were unfounded and distorted “the work of a scholar and news analyst known for her independence and years of service to the United States.”“Dr. Terry has not held a security clearance for over a decade, and her views on matters relating to the Korean Peninsula have been consistent over many years,” Wolosky said. “In fact, she was a harsh critic of the South Korean government during times this indictment alleges that she was acting on its behalf.”He added, “Once the facts are made clear, it will be evident the government made a significant mistake.”Nicholas Biase, a spokesperson for the Southern District, declined to comment. The South Korean Embassy did not immediately return a message seeking comment.Considered an expert on North Korea and broader security issues in the region, Terry has worked not only at the CIA, but at the National Intelligence Council and the National Security Council , places where she produced “hundreds of intelligence assessments,” according to her biography on the Council on Foreign Relations website.According to the indictment, federal agents had suspicions regarding Terry’s contact with South Korea as early as November 2014, when the FBI called her in for a voluntary interview.As she was questioned, Terry became “visibly nervous, changed her speech pattern and began to stutter and shift in her seat,” the indictment said. Over the ensuing years, agents would track Terry to numerous restaurants and luxury stores in Washington, D.C., providing photos of her dining with her handlers and standing next to them at cash registers as they bought her expensive goods. Several were included in court papers Tuesday.In an interview with the FBI in June 2023, Terry, who was born in Seoul but raised in the United States, admitted that she had resigned from the CIA in 2008 rather than be fired because the agency had “problems” with her contacts with members of South Korea’s National Intelligence Service, the indictment said.But her national security work was only prelude to more wrongdoing after she left the government, according to prosecutors, including disclosing “nonpublic US government information” to intelligence officers working for South Korea. The indictment says Terry handed over handwritten notes of a private group meeting in 2022 regarding the US government’s policy toward North Korea that she attended with Secretary of State Antony Blinken.During this period, the indictment said, Terry worked for several well-known think tanks in Washington.Terry’s activity on behalf of South Korea started small and became more ambitious as she worked with three different handlers, the indictment said. At first, she mainly published opinion articles favorable to South Korea’s stance on North Korea, but soon she was facilitating meetings between incoming Trump administration officials and South Korean intelligence agents in 2016. By 2018, Terry was hosting meetings at a think tank at the request of her South Korean handlers, giving them access to US national security officials, the indictment said.Terry made media appearances and wrote articles in US and South Korean publications reflecting Seoul’s policy priorities, the indictment said, including an opinion piece for The New York Times in 2014. She also testified before Congress about North Korea, which required her to sign a form before each hearing declaring that she was not a registered foreign agent.In April 2023, Terry hosted an event at a think tank where she invited congressional staff members and worked to study South Korea’s alliance with the United States at the request of the South Korean National Intelligence Service. Terry then invited the staff members to a happy hour where South Korean intelligence officers were present, allowing the officers to “spot and assess” potential recruits, according to the indictment.As her work became more risky, her rewards were greater, prosecutors said. Her payment started with a $2,950 Bottega Veneta bag and ballooned to lump sums of $11,000 and then $25,000, paid to Terry’s gift account at the think tank where she worked, over which she had sole discretion, they said.During lavish dinners at primarily Michelin-starred sushi restaurants, followed by drinks at rooftop bars, Terry’s handler would feed her lines she would then parrot in media appearances in the form of policy recommendations regarding US-South Korea relations, the indictment said.Iva Zoric, a spokesperson for the Council on Foreign Relations, said the organization had learned of the indictment Tuesday and placed Terry on unpaid administrative leave. She added that the council would cooperate with any investigation.","Sue Mi Terry is a prominent voice on US foreign policy.

US presidential polls: Joe Biden circle shrinks as Democrats fear election wipeout,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-presidential-polls-joe-biden-circle-shrinks-as-democrats-fear-election-wipeout/articleshow/111817320.cms,"WASHINGTON: In the nearly three weeks since President Joe Biden took the debate stage in Atlanta and plunged his reelection campaign into chaos, his closest consultations have been not with his White House chief of staff, his top communications strategist or even the leader of his campaign.Instead, he is relying on members of his family — a tight-knit clan that includes his son, Hunter, and the first lady, Jill Biden — along with a tiny group of loyalists to steer him through a self-created crisis and quell a rising rebellion against his candidacy from within his own party.Biden has not consulted directly with the pollsters on his 500-person campaign team about the state of the race against Donald Trump but has instead relied on Mike Donilon, a longtime friend, former pollster and Biden campaign messaging guru, to summarize the numbers, with regular memos and numerous daily phone calls.The ever-buzzing phone of Steve Ricchetti, a close counselor to Biden since his vice presidency, is the main conduit between concerned lawmakers and the president.Biden speaks frequently to his son, Hunter, who calls and texts the president and first lady multiple times a day to see how they are coping with the onslaught of scrutiny surrounding his father’s health, mental fitness and final presidential campaign.Recent interviews with more than three dozen people, some of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations about the campaign, reveal a truth about the state of the president’s campaign: the people steering Biden through the biggest political crisis of his presidency are true believers in the mythology of Joe Biden as the comeback kid, and they discount opinions to the contrary.The result is a historic standoff between Biden and his small inner circle on the one hand, and broad swaths of voters and elected Democrats fearful of an electoral wipeout in November on the other.It’s a battle Biden has seemed to embrace in recent days. When asked Monday night about whom he consults on issues like remaining in the race or dropping out, the president offered a terse response: “Me.”“Look, I’ve been doing this a long time,” he said in an interview with NBC’s Lester Holt, adding, “My mental acuity’s been pretty damn good.”Biden has expressed frustration to allies that people do not seem to accept that he is mentally cogent and fit to lead, according to a person familiar with his thinking. And he believes his polling should reflect what he sees as his accomplishments.The attempted assassination of Trump on Saturday has muted some of the public pressure on Biden to exit the race. But the party remains deeply divided. Leaders of the Democratic National Committee are using the moment to move swiftly to confirm him as his party’s presidential nominee by the end of July, according to four people briefed on the matter, while many other Democrats are in despair about Biden’s prospects.Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who is running for Senate, warned during a private meeting with donors Saturday that his party was likely to suffer overwhelming losses in November if Biden stayed in the race, according to two people with direct knowledge of Schiff’s remarks at the meeting.Recent polls show Biden trailing in most or all of the battleground states.“I think if he is our nominee, I think we lose,” Schiff said at a fundraiser in New York, according to a person with access to a transcription of a recording of the event. “And we may very, very well lose the Senate and lose our chance to take back the House.”Although Biden is taking advice mostly from his closest circle, he has been trying to prove that he is up for reelection by holding a series of meetings with lawmakers intended to hear concerns about his candidacy. He has held private discussions with Democratic governors and lawmakers, including with Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader, in Biden’s vacation home in Rehoboth, Delaware, on Saturday. But multiple participants said the encounters have been carefully choreographed events that failed to alleviate their worries.On Friday, Biden abruptly left a call with Hispanic members of the House after one lawmaker, Rep. Mike Levin, D-Calif., called on him to get out of the race. Three participants familiar with that call said questions were preselected by Biden’s staff. Andrew Bates, a White House spokesperson, called that claim “false.”On Saturday, as Biden prepared to meet with centrist members of the House, several participants said the Biden campaign tried to solicit questions beforehand, which Bates also denied.“They don’t want to hear my question, which is, ‘Are you cloistered? Have you heard what the polling is, that we no longer have three swing states; we have seven or 10?’” said Rep. Mike Quigley, D-Ill., who has called for Biden to step aside. “The numbers are trending to more swing states, and worse numbers, and more congressional seats that are now contested. It’s going the opposite direction.”During the call, Biden brushed away Rep. Chrissy Houlahan, D-Pa., when she told him he was trailing in her state by 4 to 5 percentage points, according to two people who participated in the call.During an earlier call Saturday, with progressive members of the House, Biden appeared to read from a note passed to him by a staff member: “Stay positive, you are sounding defensive.” According to a lawmaker on the call, the president was poking fun at his aides, not accidentally reading the directive. But the lawmaker said it spoke to how stage-managed the calls have seemed.Other lawmakers say they remain mystified that Biden has not done more to reach out to House members and members of the Senate, including a visit to Capitol Hill, where Biden spent 36 years and that he maintains deep reverence for.Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., described the outreach from Biden as “too scripted and too superficial,” saying the “hard conversations” were not happening. And now, after the shooting at Trump’s rally Saturday night, he thought they might never occur.“I suspect the attempted assassination of Donald Trump will likely crowd out the serious reckoning that should happen around the Democratic nomination,” Torres, who has not called on Biden to step aside, said in an interview.As he has for much of his career, Biden is relying most heavily on input from his small group of aides, which also includes Bruce Reed, who advises the president on policy and writes many of his speeches. Reed and Anita Dunn, the president’s senior communications adviser, have crafted the 100-days agenda Biden debuted at a rally Friday.Close allies, including Ron Klain, Biden’s former chief of staff, and Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., are also on speed dial. Biden is choosing their counsel over soliciting a broad range of views within a party that remains fiercely divided over his continued candidacy. And they all are betting that, at age 81, he will pull off the biggest upset of his political career.Complicating matters for people hoping for Biden to step aside is that he fared far better during a nearly hourlong news conference Thursday than he did at the debate. He also turned in an energetic performance Friday at a rally in Michigan, where he was buoyed by a chanting crowd that booed and pointed at the press when he criticized his media coverage.And he does have supporters who are encouraged by what they see.“President Biden met the moment by calling for this country to come together and reject any political violence,” said Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif. “In terms of his campaign, what is needed is a bold agenda for 2024 including rent caps, expanding Social Security and ending medical debt. He finally broke through by offering that in Detroit.”White House aides disputed the claim that Biden has closed himself off to outside voices.“President Biden is incredibly proud of the well-rounded team he has built, with whom he’s fighting for middle-class families, for our freedoms, and the rule of law,” said Bates, the White House spokesperson. “The president frequently meets with a wide variety of administration officials, ranging from policy experts to team members who engage with all manner of communities, to governors, mayors and members of Congress.”Bates added, “He has not made changes to the group of advisers he consults, who he trusts because they’ve demonstrated the integrity to tell the truth and keep the well-being of the American people front of mind.”Still, there have been concerns among Democrats about who is advising the president in such a high-stakes moment. Hunter Biden, who is based in Los Angeles, was recently in a White House meeting preparing his father for a speech and is known to informally advise him on other political matters. If he cannot reach either the president or first lady, he calls on Anthony Bernal, Jill Biden’s senior adviser, who is in most senior-level meetings involving the president — an unusual status for an East Wing aide.Bernal, who has been with the Bidens since the 2008 campaign, is known as an enforcer within the White House. The tight-knit Biden family prizes loyalty, and Bernal delivers: “The guy would walk in front of a speeding train for her,” a close friend of Jill Biden said.Bernal works closely with Annie Tomasini, the White House deputy chief of staff, who is almost always at the president’s side. A senior White House official, describing her value to the Bidens and to the administration, referred to Tomasini’s background as a three-time captain of her college basketball team at Boston University: “She wants to help the team, and wants to help the team win.”The small group’s value to Biden and his family, in large part, is that they place a high value on loyalty to him and his family. It was a sentiment that came through to some Democratic senators who attended a briefing with Ricchetti, Donilon and Jen O’Malley Dillon, Biden’s campaign chair, this past week, according to two people familiar with the meeting.People familiar with the dynamic say there is a larger group of senior aides who meet each day to plan for the hours ahead. Since the debate, there have been two daily meetings: one at 9 a.m. and the other at 9 p.m.That group includes Jeff Zients, the White House chief of staff, who meets with the president multiple times a day on topics ranging from foreign policy to natural disasters. Zients, who has been a main point of contact for Schumer, has been involved in several recent meetings to shore up support, including one between Biden and Democratic governors. He has joined calls with Democratic donors and with business leaders and Dillon, who speaks with Biden regularly, has held private conversations and joined several meetings with outside stakeholders, including with donors, lawmakers and party officials.Ben LaBolt, the White House communications director, also attends the larger meetings. So does Dunn, who runs communications strategy for the White House and who has prepared Biden for his recent interviews.Dunn and Donilon composed the letter Biden sent to congressional Democrats on Monday of last week, relaying his decision to stay in the race. Sending the letter was Donilon’s idea, according to a person familiar with the process.When Biden delivered an Oval Office address Sunday evening, Donilon and Dunn were in the room with him reading along.Biden family members and allies have accused Dunn and others, publicly and privately, of setting Biden up for failure in the debate and for curbing his public appearances — a charge her defenders in the White House say is unfair. Biden has told members of his debate preparation team, which was led by Klain and a cast of other aides including Reed and Donilon, that he is not upset with them, two people familiar with those discussions said.Hunter Biden, who was recently convicted on felony gun charges, has also been frustrated by the approach taken by Dunn and her husband, Bob Bauer, Biden’s personal attorney, to put some distance between the president and his son’s legal troubles. The president’s son disputed accounts that there were tensions.“I have nothing but gratitude for Bob and Anita who have tirelessly supported my entire family personally and professionally for years, and continue to do so today and going forward,” Hunter Biden said in a statement.Still, the tension between Dunn and some in Biden’s inner circle has risen since the debate, according to people familiar with the dynamic, and Dunn has expressed her frustrations to allies.Some Biden aides were relieved Thursday evening when the president seemingly opened the door to a data-based argument that he could not win the , saying he would leave the race if his advisers told him “there’s no way you can win.”But Biden swiftly shot down that possibility, adding, “No one is saying that. No poll says that.” His denial stoked questions among some aides about what information the president has been shown.To be sure, Biden has access to external polling. He is a longtime reader of newspapers that do high-quality surveys, including The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post, according to people familiar with his media diet. He is particularly sensitive to front-page headlines. He also uses Apple News on his iPhone and is a regular watcher of cable television, particularly MSNBC. He watches his favorite show, “Morning Joe,” while working out in the mornings.But he has repeatedly and publicly questioned the reliability of polling data, wondering aloud at his news conference and to George Stephanopoulos in an ABC interview earlier this month whether polling was “as accurate as it used to be.”The Biden campaign had not conducted an extensive survey since the debate until Monday of last week, when it began fielding a poll in seven swing states, according to three people familiar with the campaign operations.Even so, Biden invokes polling in nearly every one of his public appearances, saying surveys show him winning the contest. Nearly every national poll released publicly since the debate shows Trump leading or an effectively tied contest.“Recent polls show us winning,” he said at a rally in Michigan on Friday evening, pointing to a Marist poll, a rare example of a recent survey showing Biden slightly ahead of Trump, though within the margin of error.","Biden has not consulted directly with the pollsters on his 500-person campaign team about the state of the race against Donald Trump. Instead, he is relying on members of his family — a tight-knit clan that includes his son, Hunter, and the first lady, Jill Biden.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111817368,imgsize-1328081,width-400,resizemode-4/111817368.jpg"

"'Taiwan should pay US for protection': Donald Trump sparks row, throws into question America's stance in event of Chinese invasion",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/taiwan-should-pay-us-for-protection-donald-trump-sparks-row-throws-into-question-americas-stance-in-event-of-chinese-invasion/articleshow/111816871.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former US President Donald Trump has stirred controversy with his remarks suggesting that the self-governed island of Taiwan should pay for American protection against potential Chinese aggression. In an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek, Trump stated that ""Taiwan should pay us for defense "" and likened the arrangement to ""an insurance company"".Trump's statements diverge from the Biden administration's position, which has repeatedly pledged to deploy US troops in defense of Taiwan. This shift in approach has injected uncertainty into the US, stance on Taiwan, a territory that has become a contentious issue in the ongoing tensions between Washington and Beijing.Trump's rationale appears to be rooted in his perception of Taiwan's thriving semiconductor industry, which he claims has ""taken away the US' chip business"".He suggested that Taiwan's valuable semiconductor sector, dominated by companies like TSMC, is a key interest for Chinese President Xi Jinping, implying that Beijing may refrain from seizing the island due to this economic consideration.However, Trump's remarks have drawn criticism from lawmakers, such as Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, who accused the former president of jeopardising Taiwan's interests and emphasized the importance of upholding commitments to the island's vibrant democracy.In response to Trump's statements, Taiwan's Premier Cho Jung-tai expressed the island's willingness to shoulder more responsibility for its own defense.Cho highlighted Taiwan's efforts to enhance its self-defense capabilities, including increasing its military budget and extending compulsory military service. This stance underscores Taiwan's determination to bolster its defenses in the face of growing Chinese military threats.Experts, such as Bonnie Glaser, director of the Asia Program at the German Marshall Fund, have clarified that Trump's remarks did not indicate a refusal to defend Taiwan, but rather suggested that Taiwan should contribute more to collective defense efforts. However, this perspective still raises concerns about the potential implications for Taiwan's security and the broader regional stability.The Taiwan Relations Act, which mandates the US to provide Taiwan with military hardware and technology to deter potential invasion, remains a cornerstone of US policy. Analysts, like Tung Wen-chi of the National Chengchi University, have emphasized the significance of this legislation, describing it as a national consensus that would be challenging to alter.As the 2024 U.S. presidential election approaches, Trump's stance on Taiwan's defense costs and the potential for US intervention in the event of a Chinese incursion will likely continue to be a topic of intense scrutiny and debate.The outcome of this election could have significant consequences for Taiwan's future and the broader geopolitical landscape.","Former US President Donald Trump has stirred controversy with his remarks suggesting that the self-governed island of Taiwan should pay for American protection against potential Chinese aggression.

"Terror attacks kill 10 soldiers, 5 civilians in Pakistan’s volatile northwest",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/terror-attacks-kill-10-soldiers-5-civilians-in-pakistans-volatile-northwest/articleshow/111791956.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan army said on Tuesday that at least 15 people, including 10 soldiers , were killed in two separate attacks in the volatile northwest bordering Afghanistan and added that security forces killed all 13 assailants in the ensuing gunfights.Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the army’s media wing, reported that two female health workers, two children, and a security guard were killed when terrorists stormed a rural medical facility in militancy-hit Dera Ismail Khan district on Tuesday.Pakistani forces, the ISPR said, “effectively engaged” the assailants, killing three of them and losing two soldiers in the clashes.The announcement came just hours after the military confirmed the deaths of at least eight soldiers in a pre-dawn militant raid against an army base in the garrison town of Bannu on Monday. It stated that security forces killed all 10 assailants in the ensuing gunfight.The attack on Bannu cantonment, the ISPR said, had been orchestrated by militants based in Afghanistan. “The attempt to enter the cantonment was effectively thwarted by security forces personnel, which forced the terrorists to ram an explosives-laden vehicle into the perimeter wall of the cantonment,” ISPR said.It added that the suicide car bombing destroyed a portion of the wall and damaged adjoining infrastructure, resulting in the deaths of the eight soldiers.“In the ensuing operation, our troops effectively engaged the terrorists as a result of which all 10 terrorists were sent to hell,” the army said. “This timely and effective response by the security forces prevented a major catastrophe, saving precious innocent lives,” it added.Locals said the blast was heard miles away and caused damage to nearby houses and shops. They said they saw black smoke billowing above the site and heard gunshots in the cantonment area.A militant outfit allied with the globally designated terrorist group Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) took responsibility for the attack shortly after it started.The ISPR statement attributed the assault to the Hafiz Gul Bahadur group which, according to it, operates from Afghanistan and has used Afghan soil to orchestrate acts of terrorism inside Pakistan in the past.Bannu and adjoining districts in the border province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have particularly seen frequent TTP attacks targeting military and police forces since the Taliban reclaimed power in Afghanistan three years ago.Pakistan maintains TTP leaders and fighters are being increasingly facilitated by the de facto rulers of Afghanistan. The Taliban govt dismisses the allegations, saying TTP is an internal problem for Pakistan to deal with.There has been a sharp rise in terror incidents since PM Shehbaz Sharif announced anewmilitary offensive against militancy and extremism in the country’s northwestern and southwestern border regions. The announcement was vehemently resisted by Pashtun and Baloch leaderships in Baluchistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces through public protests, rallies and digital media campaigns.","At least 15 people, including 10 soldiers, killed in two separate attacks in the volatile northwest bordering Afghanistan.
