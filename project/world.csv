"As Yunus takes oath, PM Modi presses for safety of Hindus",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/as-yunus-takes-oath-pm-modi-presses-for-safety-of-hindus/articleshow/112387244.cms,"PM’s message to Yunus comes amid targeted violence against Hindus

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Thursday asked the new regime in Bangladesh to ensure safety of beleaguered Hindus and other minority communities who have been under attack from violent mobs rampaging through the country since the ouster of Sheikh Hasina as PM.Modi extended his best wishes to the Nobel Prize-winning economist who took over as head of an interim govt in Bangladesh.“My best wishes to Professor Muhammad Yunus on the assumption of his new responsibilities. We hope for an early return to normalcy, ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities,” the PM said on X, his first remarks since the chaotic resignation of Hasina on Monday.Modi also conveyed his desire to work with the new regime in Bangladesh which under Hasina remained sensitive to India’s security concerns.India remains committed to working with Bangladesh to fulfil the shared aspirations of both our peoples for peace, security and development,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said.The PM’s message to Yunus to protect Hindus and other minority communities came amid violence which has seen them being targeted and their properties and temples destroyed by violent mobs.Foreign minister S Jaishankar and his ministry had raised the campaign against minority communities but Modi went far beyond in making a reference to “Hindus”, who have borne the brunt of a systematic campaign of violence that appears to have been organised by radicals and known anti-India forces.Also, unlike in the case of Jaishankar who briefed Parliament in the immediate wake of Sheikh Hasina’s resignation and when no govt was in place in Dhaka, Modi’s message was aimed at Yunus as the head of the interim govt.Leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi too congratulated Yunus for his new assignment, while emphasising the importance of fast restoration of peace and normalcy. “Congratulations to Professor Muhammad Yunus on being sworn in as head of Bangladesh’s interim govt. A swift restoration of peace and normalcy is the need of the hour,” Gandhi said.","PM Narendra Modi has asked the new regime in Bangladesh to ensure safety of beleaguered Hindus and other minority communities.

"‘Opposition crossing all limits’, says irked Dhankhar, leaves House",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/opposition-crossing-all-limits-says-irked-dhankhar-leaves-house/articleshow/112385426.cms,"NEW DELHI: The fraught relationship between Rajya Sabha Chairperson and the opposition came to the fore once again on Thursday, with Jagdeep Dhankhar leaving the House for some time after an uproar and walkout by MPs not allowed to raise wrestler Vinesh Phogat ’s disqualification from the Olympics.Accusing the opposition parties of “always challenging” him, Dhankhar said they were “crossing all limits” to create “anarchy” in the House and disrespecting the prestige of the Chair.Cautioning Derek O'Brien in particular for “shouting at the Chair”, he said the Trinamool leader would next time be “shown the door”.Leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge sought to raise Phogat’s disqualification, wanting to know “who is behind it”, as soon as proceedings began after tabling of the listed papers on Thursday. Dhankhar, however, disallowed it. He then told O’Brien, who was up on his feet, that his conduct was unbecoming. “You (O’Brien) are shouting at the Chair. Your conduct is ugliest in the House. I condemn your actions. Next time I will show you the door,” he said.The opposition parties then staged a walkout. “We have seen the dark days... the ugliest phase of democracy during the Emergency... It starts with a challenge to Parliamentary institutions,” Dhankhar said.“They (opposition) think they are the only ones whose hearts are bleeding. The entire nation, from the President to the PM to myself and others, is feeling the pain because of our girl (Phogat),” he said, adding the opposition’s bid to “politicise” and “monetise” the matter was the “greatest disrespect” to the wrestler herself.Leader of the House J P Nadda also condemned the opposition’s disrespect for the Chair and democratic traditions, saying it simply did not have “solid” issues to discuss. The entire country is behind Phogat he said.Expressing anguish that he was not getting the desired support from the opposition to run the House despite him making all efforts, Dhankhar said, “They are not challenging me they think that the person who is sitting on this Chair is not capable.”“I am not running away from the oath. But what I have seen today, the way a member has behaved, the way the opposition bench has behaved, I am not finding myself in a position to sit here for some time,” Dhankar said, adding he was leaving the House “with a heavy heart”.Deputy Chairperson Harivansh then chaired the zero hour proceedings. Returning to the Chair around mid-way into the question hour, Dhankhar said, “I left my seat to introspect. Having witnessed (the scene)... which I found was unprecedented, and indigestible.” He announced he has called a meeting of floor leaders at 1.30 PM to discuss the matter.","Rajya Sabha Chairperson Jagdeep Dhankhar left the House for some time after an uproar and walkout by MPs not allowed to raise wrestler Vinesh Phogat ’s disqualification from the Olympics.

Agra Police arrested two youths for pouring water at the Taj Mahal, claiming it to be a Hindu temple. The suspects entered as tourists and were reported by the CISF.

Instead of being vigilant, authorities are imposing restrictions on water bottles. The association opposes this move.” He added, “Multiple cases of tourists passing out due to adverse weather conditions have surfaced in the last three months. Without water, visitors, especially children and the elderly, will suffer. The decision will also present a bad image among foreign tourists.”ASI superintending archaeologist Rajkumar Patel assured that visitors would not face inconvenience.

Hannah Jacobs , a 13-year-old girl lost her life after consuming a hot chocolate that allegedly contained dairy.

However, while waiting at the dental clinic, Hannah took a sip and immediately raised concerns that the drink contained dairy instead of soya milk.Hannah was swiftly taken to a nearby pharmacy, where she received an EpiPen to counter the suspected anaphylactic reaction. An ambulance crew soon arrived and transported her to the hospital but despite numerous attempts to resuscitate her, Hannah passed away at 1 pm.Starting Monday, an inquiry into her death will commence at the coroner's court in east London, with the proceedings expected to span a week.According to government data, approximately 2.4 million adults in the UK live with food allergies, and hospital admissions for severe allergic reactions have seen a threefold increase over the past two decades.Anaphylaxis, the most severe form of allergic reaction, can lead to life-threatening breathing difficulties and cardiac emergencies.","Hannah Jacobs had a severe allergy to dairy, fish, and eggs, and believed the drink was prepared using soya milk.

This temporary ban on X is another move against big tech, following Maduro's call for supporters to abandon WhatsApp in favor of Telegram or WeChat, claiming that the messaging app was being used to threaten the families of soldiers and police officers.Venezuela's electoral authority proclaimed Maduro the winner of the July 28 presidential election with some 51% of the vote, although it has yet to produce the voting tallies.This declaration led to widespread accusations of fraud and protests, which were promoted across social media. The Venezuelan Observatory for Social Conflict reports that at least 23 people have been killed in these protests, as per the Reuters.The opposition, led by Maria Corina Machado and Edmundo Gonzalez, claims to have copies of the voting tallies showing that Gonzalez won the election with more than 7 million votes, compared to Maduro's 3.3 million votes, a result similar to that predicted by independent exit polls. Several countries, including the US, Argentina, and Chile, have refused to recognize Maduro's claimed victory and have called for transparency and the publication of the voting tallies. China and Russia, however, have congratulated Maduro on his victory.Venezuelan security forces have launched a crackdown on what authorities say are violent criminals, with Maduro touting more than 2,000 arrests. Advocacy groups, however, claim that those arrested are peaceful demonstrators being targeted for repression.Brian A Nichols, assistant secretary for western hemisphere affairs for the US state department, stated on X, ""The voices of Venezuelan voters will not be silenced by repression, censorship, or disinformation. The world is watching.""The foreign ministers of Mexico, Colombia, and Brazil have reiterated calls for Venezuela's electoral authority to publish the vote tallies in a joint statement. This statement followed comments by Machado, who called on Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to impress upon Maduro that his best option is to negotiate with the country's opposition.","Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro announced on Thursday that access to social media platform X had been blocked in South America for 10 days.

Otherwise, I'm speaking,"" she said, her expression hardening as she sought to quell the disruptions.Harris will also be keen not to alienate the majority of US voters whom polls say support Israel.As vice president, Harris has sometimes been more critical than Biden of the civilian casualties caused by Israel's offensive in Gaza.Harris then made a major shift in tone after Biden dropped out of the 2024 election, saying in a strongly worded statement after she met Israeli premier Benjamin Netanyahu that she would ""not be silent"" on the situation.But the comments by Harris's adviser appeared to make it clear she would not go as far as endorsing any kind of all-out pause in arms transfers.Under Biden, the White House has only halted the delivery of a single shipment of heavy bombs to Israel over concerns about how they would be used.On Wednesday in Detroit, Harris and her new running mate Tim Walz briefly met the leaders of the ""Uncommitted"" group that mobilized people to cast protest votes against Biden in this year's Democratic primary, US media reported.Its founders told the New York Times that they had asked Harris for a full meeting to discuss their calls for an embargo, and Harris told them she was open to a meeting.","Kamala Harris does not support an arms embargo on US ally Israel, a top aide says.

The revelation has left her life in turmoil and led to a series of dramatic decisions and reactions.The situation unfolded when the lady, known on the platform as ThrowRA-3xbetrayal, had struggled with infertility and undergone a partial hysterectomy , and decided to use a surrogate to have a child.Her close friend, who had agreed to act as the surrogate, became a significant part of the couple’s life throughout the pregnancy.Suspicions arose when the child was born with brown eyes, despite both the lady and her husband having blue eyes. This prompted her to investigate further. Tests revealed discrepancies in blood types, and a subsequent DNA test confirmed that while her husband was the biological father, she was not the biological mother.In a shocking confession, the woman learned from her husband that he had slept with the surrogate during their efforts to conceive. This meant that the child, who she had believed was conceived through IVF, was actually conceived naturally with the surrogate.Devastated by the discovery, she has decided to divorce her husband and give up her parental rights to the child. This decision has sparked controversy, with some arguing that it is unfair given the two years she has spent raising the child.In the Reddit forum, users have largely supported her decision. Comments suggested that she might consider legal action against the surrogate for misleading her and taking financial support under false pretenses.One commenter advised, “You should speak to a solicitor about suing her for your money back. She knew that if she was having sex, there was always a chance the child was biologically hers.”Others validated her choice to end her relationship and parental rights, noting the betrayal involved. “It would be wonderful if you love the kid enough to stay, but if you're in shock and damaged too much to do so, you aren't wrong for walking away,” a commenter wrote.Some pointed out societal double standards, arguing that if the roles were reversed, a man would not be judged harshly for abandoning a child conceived through infidelity.",A Reddit post has sparked widespread discussion after a woman revealed that a DNA test showed she is not the biological mother of her 2-year-old son.

That time Trump nearly died in a helicopter crash? Didn’t happen.,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/that-time-trump-nearly-died-in-a-helicopter-crash-didnt-happen-/articleshow/112389579.cms,"Former President Donald Trump told a jaw-dropping story Thursday about nearly dying in a helicopter ride with Willie Brown , the former California politician and ex-boyfriend of his rival, Vice President Kamala Harris.There was only one problem with the story. Or maybe two. Or maybe three.It wasn’t the famous former San Francisco mayor on the helicopter flight at all.It was Gov. Jerry Brown , the former governor of California, who bears little resemblance to Willie Brown.There was also no emergency landing , and the helicopter’s passengers were never in any danger at all, according to Gov. Gavin Newsom, who was also on the flight.Jerry Brown, who left office in January 2019, said through a spokesperson, “There was no emergency landing and no discussion of Kamala Harris.”“I call complete BS,” Newsom said, laughing out loud.Trump’s errant account, delivered during a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, came in response to a reporter who asked a leading question about Harris’ past relationship with Willie Brown, and whether Trump thought it might have had something to do with her career trajectory.Harris and Brown dated in 1994 and 1995, while she was a prosecutor in Alameda County, which includes Oakland, and he was the speaker of the California State Assembly, and he appointed her to two state boards. He was — and still is — married to Blanche Brown, but they have long lived separate lives.“Well, I know Willie Brown very well,” Trump responded. “In fact, I went down in a helicopter with him.”He went on to tell a cinematic tale of a close call with death — and of politically advantageous gossip on death’s door.“We thought maybe this was the end,” Trump said. “We were in a helicopter, going to a certain location together, and there was an emergency landing. This was not a pleasant landing.“And Willie was — he was a little concerned. So I know him, but I know him pretty well. I mean, I haven’t seen him in years. But he told me terrible things about her. But this is what you’re telling me, anyway, I guess. But he had a big part in what happened with Kamala. But he — he, I don’t know, maybe he’s changed his tune. But he — he was not a fan of hers very much, at that point.”Reached on his cellphone just after Trump’s news conference — at his regular lunch spot at Sam’s Grill in downtown San Francisco — Willie Brown, 90, said the whole story was false. He had never ridden in a helicopter with Trump, he said. He had never nearly perished in any helicopter ride. And he remained an avid supporter of Harris’.Brown, who loves regaling anybody who will listen with stories and who penned a weekly column in the San Francisco Chronicle until 2021, added, laughing: “You know me well enough to know that if I almost went down in a helicopter with anybody, you would have heard about it!”Harris ended their relationship nearly three decades ago, but Brown said he had always been a big fan and supporter of hers. “No hard feelings,” he said.The helicopter ride that Trump took in 2018 with Gov. Jerry Brown and with Newsom, then the governor-elect of California, was to survey damage wrought by the deadly Camp fire in the town of Paradise, in the Sierra Nevada foothills north of Sacramento.Newsom’s recollection of the occasion was vivid.“I was on a helicopter with Jerry Brown and Trump, and it didn’t go down,” Newsom said in an interview. He said Trump had, however, repeatedly brought up the possibility of crashing.The subject of Harris, with whom Newsom had enjoyed a friendly rivalry, did not come up on the plane ride, he added. “We talked about everyone else, but not Kamala,” he said with a laugh.Newsom called Trump’s news conference “an act of desperation” prompted by what he called Harris’ momentum.Trump’s visit to the burned forest with Brown and Newsom did generate headlines, but not because of anything that occurred on their helicopter ride. Rather, it was because, during a news conference after landing at the scene, Trump attributed the wildfire to too many fallen, dead tree branches and said the answer to solving California’s wildfire crisis was to rake the forest floors.“It was back when we were making raking the forest great again,” Newsom said.","Gov.

I can tell you that.”Trump also remarked on the changing dynamics of the 2024 race, noting, “We were given Joe Biden, and now we’re given somebody else.

The stare-down was the latest reminder of how Harris has been able, with an almost theatrical flair, to turn efforts to undermine and rattle her into her own political weapons . She also takes particular umbrage at being interrupted.During 2020 debate with then-VP Mike Pence, she objected to his repeated bids to cut into her responses.

Biden's decision came after a challenging debate on June 27, where his performance against Trump was widely criticized. Before Biden's exit, Reuters/Ipsos polls consistently showed a tight race between Biden and Trump, with Biden underperforming compared to his 2020 campaign, in which he defeated Trump.The August Ipsos poll also explored voters' perceptions of the candidates. Trump was more frequently associated with the word ""patriot,"" a term often highlighted in his campaign rhetoric.

US elections: Kamala Harris and Donald Trump to face off in prime-time debate on September 10,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-elections-kamala-harris-and-donald-trump-to-face-off-in-prime-time-debate-on-september-10/articleshow/112389058.cms,"Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are set to meet in a highly anticipated prime-time debate on September 10, as announced by ABC News on Thursday. This 90-minute showdown, expected to be held in Philadelphia, marks a pivotal moment in an unpredictable presidential campaign that has already seen significant twists and turns.The debate will be moderated by ABC anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis. Although the exact format and ground rules are still being finalized, it is likely that the event will proceed without a live audience, according to sources familiar with the plans.Notably, Trump had proposed three debates with major networks - September 4 with Fox News, September 10 with NBC, and September 25 with ABC. However, Harris has agreed to participate only in the September 10 debate with NBC. Harris has not yet provided reasons for declining the other proposed dates.This announcement follows Trump's initial agreement to debate President Joe Biden on the same date, an arrangement made months ago. However, after Biden's unexpected withdrawal from the race, Trump questioned the validity of that commitment with Harris, leading to uncertainty over whether the debate would take place.Recent events, including Biden's exit and an assassination attempt on Trump, have drawn renewed attention to the presidential race, which had initially been shaping up as a repeat of the 2020 election. The upcoming ABC debate is expected to serve as a critical moment in the campaign's final stretch leading up to the election.Trump has also indicated his willingness to engage in additional debates with Harris, proposing events hosted by NBC News and Fox News. However, the Harris campaign has not yet agreed to these additional debates. NBC News is reportedly in discussions with both campaigns about a potential debate on September 25, but Harris has not committed to participating. Similarly, no agreement has been reached for a debate hosted by Fox News.","The debate will be moderated by ABC anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis.

Crooks aimed his weapon at the officer who had scaled the structure. The officer suffered an ankle injury when he lost his grip and plummeted around eight feet.

Asif Merchant: Who is Asif Merchant? Pakistani man with ties to Iran charged in assassination plots in US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/who-is-asif-merchant-pakistani-man-with-ties-to-iran-charged-in-assassination-plots-in-us/articleshow/112328015.cms,"Who is Asif Merchant?

Asif Raza Merchant was charged in a complaint unsealed in federal court in Brooklyn with murder-for-hire as part of a scheme to assassinate a politician or US government officials on its soil. Law enforcement said they foiled the charged plot before any attack could be carried out. Merchant, who has stated that he has a wife and children in Iran and a wife and children in Pakistan, is in federal custody in New York. US Attorney Breon Peace for the Eastern District of New York said that working on behalf of others overseas, Merchant planned the murder of US government officials on American soil. According to court documents, Merchant orchestrated a plot to assassinate a politician or US government officials on US soil. FBI director Christopher Wray said the ""dangerous murder-for-hire"" plot allegedly was orchestrated by a Pakistani national with close ties to Iran and is straight out of the Iranian playbook. In April 2024, after spending time in Iran, Merchant arrived in the United States from Pakistan and contacted a person he believed could assist him with the scheme. That person reported Merchant's conduct to law enforcement and became a confidential source. In early June, Merchant met the confidential source in New York and explained his assassination plot. Merchant told the individual the opportunity he had for the person was not a one-time opportunity and would be ongoing. Merchant then made a ""finger gun"" motion with his hand, indicating that the opportunity was related to a killing. Merchant stated that the intended victims would be ""targeted here"", meaning in the United States. Merchant instructed the individual to arrange meetings with others whom he could hire to carry out these actions. Merchant explained that his plot involved multiple criminal schemes including stealing documents or USB drives from a target's home; planning a protest; and killing a politician or government official. Merchant at the meeting began planning potential assassination scenarios and quizzed the individual on how he would kill a target in the various scenarios.

The plot by Asif Merchant

A 46-year-old Pakistani man, Asif Merchant , has been charged by the US Department of Justice for plotting to kill politicians, government officials on the US soil. Prosecutors in Brooklyn announced criminal charges against Asif Merchant, accusing him of travelling to New York for the purposes of trying to hire a hitman for the assassinations. The plot was disrupted before it could be carried out.The document did not name any potential target but CNN reported that former president Donald Trump and other current and former US government officials might be the targets of the plot.Trump was shot at by Thomas Crooks at a Pennsylvania rally last month in which the shooter was killed. This attempt was unrelated to the life threat that Trump had from Iran. US officials have warned for years about Iran's desire to avenge the 2020 killing of Qassem Soleimani, who led the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' Quds Force. That strike was ordered by Trump.Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement: ""The Justice Department will spare no resource to disrupt and hold accountable those who would seek to carry out Iran's lethal plotting against American citizens and will not tolerate attempts by an authoritarian regime to target American public officials and endanger America's national security.""Merchant said, as revealed by the document, that the assassination would occur after he left the United States and he would communicate with the individual from overseas using code words. The source asked whether Merchant had spoken to the unidentified ""party"" back home with whom Merchant was working. Merchant responded that he had and the party back home told him to ""finalize"" the plan and leave the United States.In mid-June, Merchant met with the purported hitmen, who were undercover US law enforcement officers in New York. Merchant advised the undercover officers that he was looking for three services from them: theft of documents, arranging protests at political rallies, and for them to kill a ""political person"".Merchant said the hitmen would receive instructions on who to kill either the last week of August or the first week of September after he had departed the United States.On June 21, Merchant met with the undercover officers in New York and paid them the USD 5,000 advance. Merchant subsequently made flight arrangements and planned to leave the United States on July 12 when law enforcement agents placed him under arrest before he could leave the country.(With agency inputs)","A 46-year-old Pakistani man, Asif Merchant, has been charged by the US Department of Justice for plotting to kill politicians, government officials on the US soil.

Several political parties have extensively used X to present their case.The most notable is the Pakistan-Tehreek-e-Insaaf, whose jailed leader former PM Imran Khan has used X to present his point of view on various cases against him. The PTI has also used X to call for rallies and protests against the Shehbaz Sharif government. Even on Saturday, the PTI X timeline was abuzz with calls for the national protest rally in Swabi, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Khan has also been able to address election rallies using Artificial Intelligence and pushed his cause effectively on social media.In a statement posted by the PTI's Canada office, the party criticised the move saying the government was scared of informed voices.""First they ban X on flimsy 'national security' grounds, now they're coming for VPNs. The PTA must be terrified of an informed and connected populace. Why is the government so terrified of its own citizens' voices?"" the post on X from PTI Canada read.The call to ban VPNs has met with severe criticism by netizens who posted on X about their misgivings on this move. An editorial in Dawn on Saturday said such a move would deprive people of chances to realise their potential.""All of this would suggest that the effort to wall in its people and control their lives virtually may only end up pushing the country even further behind in the global race for digital supremacy. For a nation largely comprising very young people, this would be an unmitigated disaster as it could have repercussions that may spill over generations.

In 2022, the PTA asked public and private sector organizations, foreign missions, and freelancers to register their VPNs to avoid disruptions.
