"Hate speech different from seditious statements, says Supreme Court",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hate-speech-different-from-seditious-statements-says-supreme-court/articleshow/115317690.cms,"Supreme Court

If we admit this petition, it’ll open floodgates: SC

NEW DELHI: After passing pan-India directions to police to act suo motu against those making hate speeches and harming the social fabric, Supreme Court on Thursday refused to entertain a petition seeking similar action to arrest the trend of seditious speeches openly encouraging anarchy and separatism.A PIL by ‘ Hindu Sena Samiti ’ before a bench of CJI Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar had sought SC’s urgent intervention to prevent what it called the growing menace of political leaders , especially those from the opposition, making allegedly provocative public speeches and giving media interviews “prejudicial to national integrity and openly extending threats to the security of the state”.“Members of different political parties, prominent leaders from the opposition, spokespersons and members of organisations have been making public assertions for creation of conditions for secession akin to Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, calling for resorting to subversive activities and armed rebellion,” the PIL said.However, SC said that “there is a striking difference between hate speech and wrong or false assertions or false claims made by people.”The CJI Khanna-led bench said, “SC had entertained pleas for curbing hate speech as that was harming social harmony . Guidelines have been laid and the court has issued contempt notices for violation of guidelines. What you want is very wide. You have gone all over the place. If we entertain this petition, there will be a flood of such petitions and it will become impossible to deal with the issue.”The bench dismissed the PIL saying it could not entertain it. “In case the petitioner has any specific grievance, it can approach the appropriate forum,” it added. SC in April 2023 had given pan-India sway to its Oct 2022 order directing Delhi, UP, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand police to take suo motu action against those making hate speeches irrespective of the religious community they belonged to.The court had warned that any hesitation on part of state police to act against hate speech will be viewed as contempt of SC and appropriate action will be taken against erring officers.“Hate speech is a serious offence affecting the fabric of the nation and goes to the heart of our republic and about dignity of people. What we have in our mind is a larger public good and are trying to ensure establishment of rule of law so that things do not go out of our hands,” an SC bench of Justices K M Joseph and B V Nagarathna had said in April last year.",Supreme Court refuses to entertain a petition seeking similar action to arrest the trend of seditious speeches openly encouraging anarchy and separatism.

NEW DELHI: Canadian Police said on Thursday that it had arrested an Indo-Canadian man, Rajinder Kumar, in connection with the murder of a Khalistan supporter named Rabinder Singh Malhi.The killing, which yet again amplified the tension between the two communities in Canada, was reported in Ontario on Nov 9.Police also arrested Kumar’s wife, Sheetal Verma, on charges of obstruction of justiceThe local police have not yet revealed the motive behind the murder but stated that Kumar and Malhi were acquainted with each other. However, what has raised questions and made the issue murky is the involvement of Sikhs For Justice (SFJ) in the case which has been insisting that “Hindutva elements” were involved in the killing. Others have called the arrest motivated, alleging that Kumar was held as part of Trudeau regime’s policy to appease Khalistanis.SFJ chief and pro-Khalistan terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun claimed on Wednesday that Kumar had been involved in heated exchanges with Malhi on WhatsApp after a Hindu Sabha temple priest, Rajinder Parsad, made inflammatory calls for violence on Nov 3. “The verbal argument on the group culminated in Kumar luring Malhi to his home and fatally stabbing him in a premeditated attack,” Pannun said, while insisting that Canadian Police should also have arrested Parsad.Malhi (52), a resident of Brampton, was found injured at a residence on Deer Ridge Trail, north of Highway 410 and Hurontario Street, around 10pm on Nov 9, according to local media reports.On Wednesday, Peel Regional Police announced the arrest of two persons, Rajinder Kumar (47) and Sheetal Verma (35), both of Caledon. Kumar has been charged with second-degree murder, while Verma is facing a charge of obstruction of justice. Kumar is in custody and scheduled to appear before the Ontario Court of Justice in Orangeville on Nov 18.Meanwhile, a video posted on X by a Canadian journalist has led to an uproar on social media showing a group of Khalistani elements marching around Surrey BC and shouting slogans such as “we are the owners of Canada”, “Canada is Khalistan” and “white people should go back to Europe and Israel”. The sloganeering attracted a sharp response from Canadian citizens who questioned how such elements were being allowed to frame policies in their country.

DEHRADUN: Members of a right-wing group scaled the boundary wall of a prestigious residential school in Dehradun and demolished a structure that they claimed was a mazaar that was being built inside the campus.The group, claiming they took permission from govt officials to raze the structure, also streamed the act live on social media on Wednesday evening. Even as the group’s members justified their action, the episode has put in focus the security breach at the school, where children of a number of prominent personalities study.The Dehradun district administration denied issuing any orders for the structure’s demolition. “Our team visited the site when we were informed about the incident. After speaking to locals, it was clear that the structure was on the school’s campus. The administration, however, had no role in its destruction. We have taken steps to ensure law and order remains unaffected by the incident,” DM Savin Bansal said.Radha Dhoni, president of Sanatan Sanskriti , the organisation responsible for the act, claimed that the ‘mazaar’ was recently built on the campus of the school, and was “violating the chief minister’s orders prohibiting religious structures in public institutions”.Dhoni told TOI, “When we approached the school authorities, they claimed it was an old structure, previously damaged during civic work, and that they were simply repairing it. But it was clearly newly built, just a few days old. I could see the site from my home’s terrace across the road. The construction had started only recently. It was unmistakably a grave-like structure for prayers, resembling a mazaar. Why was this allowed on the school campus? And when we questioned them, the school staff wouldn’t even let us enter.”Though the act has raised serious questions about security at the elite boarding school, officials said the school has not filed a formal complaint.","Right-wing group claims they took permission from govt officials to raze the structure.

AIZWAL/GUWAHATI: Tribal groups upped the ante Thursday for the bodies of 10 Hmar “militants” killed by forces in Manipur’s Jiribam to be taken back from Silchar Medical College in south Assam’s Cachar to their native village through Mizoram, where their Kuki-Zo brethren intend to honour them as “fallen heroes”.Uncertainty over when the bodies would be handed to their families and how they would be ferried to Manipur added to the restiveness of protesters milling outside the medical college since the previous afternoon, alleging a deliberate delay in completing autopsies on the slain men.Sources said the autopsy process ended Wednesday evening, but Manipur Police was now insisting on “DNA matching” before handing over the bodies to their kin.“Matching the DNA of a deceased with his or her relatives is not part of any post-mortem formality unless the body is beyond identification,” said a former director of health and medical education in Mizoram.Unconfirmed reports said the authorities were planning to take the bodies of the deceased, who the Hmar community claims were “village volunteers” from Jakhradawr in Jiribam, to Manipur’s Churachandpur by helicopter.Indigenous Tribal Leaders’ Forum issued a statement, saying any attempt to bypass Mizoram while taking the bodies to Manipur would be resisted. “Following talks, it was decided the martyrs must be transported by road through Mizoram and then to Lamka via Tipaimukh. Any other transportation modes won’t be accepted.”","10 Hmar ""militants"" killed by forces in Manipur’s Jiribam. Protesters allege a deliberate delay in completing autopsies on the slain men.

AGRA: A 22-year-old newlywed woman on way to her in-laws' house in Aligarh from Delhi was molested by four men in the compartment of the special passenger train on Tuesday around midnight.

The miscreants beat her husband with belts when he tried to stop them.Her screams for help finally drew the attention of other people on the platform, and police were alerted.

Following the uproar, GRP released the husband and registered a case at Aligarh GRP police station against the culprits. Police said one of the accused, Jitu Sing, a resident of Usmanpur Khandauli in Agra, has been arrested. The other three, including Mahesh, a resident of Singh Kuberpur, are absconding.

"Harry Meghan News: Finally, Prince Harry may return to the Royal Family as his biggest enemy is retiring",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/finally-prince-harry-may-return-to-the-royal-family-as-his-biggest-enemy-is-retiring/articleshow/115309562.cms,"Harry's biggest enemy in the Royal Family is contemplating retirement paving way back for Harry.

What Harry wrote about 'The Wasp'



Hary will have to publicly apologize...



The person who was believed to have blocked all attempts of Prince Harry to reconcile with his father and brother is contemplating retiring and that according to royal experts is indeed good news for Harry. Though he is only 57, Clive Alderton , King Charles' all-powerful private secretary and gatekeeper, is considering retirement, royal expert Tine Brown said.Brown wrote that Harry and Alderton had a personal enmity and that dominated Alderton's advice to King Charles to not welcome Harry back to the royal fold. The replacement of Alderton by a figure without any personal animosity with Harry could ""create a new, friendlier path for negotiations with Harry"".In his memoir Spare, Harry christened Alderton as ""The Wasp"" -- such is the extent of their enmity.According to reports, Harry has been trying to reconcile with his ailing father but no meeting could have been arranged between the two and experts blame Alderton for that.“Despite the passing of years, there is still a gaping Harry-shaped hole in the depleted royal line-up. As a veteran of two military tours in Afghanistan and founder of Invictus, the substantive charity that brings hope through competitive sports events for injured vets, the Duke of Sussex, now stripped of his military honors, surely deserved a place on the balcony. The British nation needs his human touch and so does his ailing father,"" Brown wrote.Harry wrote The Wasp was ""lanky, charming, arrogant, a ball of jazzy energy"". ""He was great at pretending to be polite, even servile. You'd assert a fact, something seemingly incontrovertible—'I believe the sun rises in the mornings'—and he'd stammer that perchance you might consider for a moment the possibility that you'd been misinformed: 'Well, heh-heh, I don't know about that, Your Royal Highness, you see, it all depends what you mean by mornings, sir.' Because he seemed so weedy, so self-effacing, you might be tempted to push back, insist on your point, and that was when he'd put you on his list.A short time later, without warning, he'd give you such a stab with his outsized stinger that you'd cry out in confusion. Where the f*** did that come from?"" Harry wrote.Prince William wants Harry to publicly apologize for the hurtful comments he made after stepping down as a senior working Royal in 2020. Harry would also likely have to drop his lawsuit against the British government for stripping him of taxpayer-funded bodyguards. On the flip side, Harry and Meghan, if taken back to the royal fold again, could be put to good use on overseas tours which kind of became embarrassments for the royals.","Clive Alderton, King Charles' all-powerful private secretary and gatekeeper, is considering retirement, royal expert Tine Brown said.

Bangladesh's top legal officer, Attorney General Mohammad Asazzaman , has proposed significant changes to the country's constitution. During a High Court hearing, Asazzaman called for the removal of ""secularism"" and ""socialism"" as principles enshrined in the document.The hearing pertained to a writ petition challenging the validity of the 15th amendment, enacted by the previous Awami League government in 2011.The amendment made several changes, including restoring secularism as a state principle and designating Sheikh Mujibur Rahman as the Father of the Nation. The current interim government, however, seeks to overturn most of the amendment's provisions.While addressing the court, Asazzaman stated, ""As a whole, we do not want that (HC) rule to be scrapped.""He clarified that the government supports the petition's challenge to the 15th amendment, aiming to reinstate the caretaker government system and provisions for referendums.The Attorney General's proposal is expected to spark debate within Bangladesh as it touches upon fundamental aspects of the nation's identity and governance.The 15th amendment was passed in parliament with the strength of a brute majority of the Awami League, restoring, inserting and scrapping several provisions in the Constitution.The amendments included the restoration of secularism as a state principle, the scrapping of the caretaker government system for election oversight, assuming state power through extra-constitutional means and the designating of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman as the Father of the Nation.In his concluding arguments, Asaduzzaman told the court that the interim government wanted to declare the 15th amendment to the Constitution largely unconstitutional, retaining only select provisions.He particularly demanded the restoration of the caretaker government system and the provision of the referendum in the Constitution.The Awami League regime was toppled on August 5 in the face of a mass upsurge originating from a quota reform campaign by the Anti-Discrimination Students Movement. Three days later Nobel laureate Muhammad assumed office as the chief adviser of the interim government.","Bangladesh's top legal officer, Attorney General Mohammad Asazzaman, has proposed significant changes to the country's constitution.

But Tulsi was born in the US territory of American Samoa and was raised in Hawaii and the Philippines.

Tulsi also follows Hinduism.Videos of Tulsi chanting Hare Krishna are viral after she became the first Hindu to head US spy agencies.Since her religion made many people think that she is of Indian origin, in 2012, she herself clarified that she had no Indian link. ""I am not of Indian origin,"" Tulsi posted in reply to a message identifying as an Indian-American.Tulsi Gabbard was in the Democratic party for most of her political career. In 2022, she announced her exit from the party and said the party was under the ""complete control of an elitist cabal of warmongers driven by cowardly wokeness"". Gabbard endorsed Donald Trump only a few months before the election and pushed her anti-war stance under a Republican administration.In 2019, when Tulsi Gabbard was running in the presidential primary in the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton called her a Russian spy without naming her. “I’m not making any predictions, but I think they’ve got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate,” Clinton said calling Gabbard the favorite of the Russians.“Thank you @HillaryClinton. You, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain,” Gabbard responded to Clinton's allegations.“From the day I announced my candidacy, there has been a concerted campaign to destroy my reputation,” she added. “We wondered who was behind it and why. Now we know — it was always you, through your proxies and powerful allies in the corporate media and war machine, afraid of the threat I pose.”Tulsi Gabbard was recently put on a terror watchlist by the Biden-Harris administration.",Four-term US Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard has been named as the director of National Intelligence in Donald Trump's new cabinet.

Eva Longoria: Eva Longoria says she is moving out of 'dystopian' US because Kamala Harris didn't win,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/eva-longoria-says-she-is-moving-out-of-dystopian-us-because-kamala-harris-didnt-win/articleshow/115306218.cms,"Eva Longoria says she's leaving 'dystopian' US as Donald Trump won the election

Actor Eva Longoria who endorsed Kamala Harris in the election said she will be moving out of the 'dystopian' US that elected 'a convicted criminal' Donald Trump . She acknowledged her privilege that she could relocate to a new country which most Americans can't. ""If he (Trump) keeps his promises, it's going to be a scary place."" “The shocking part is not that he won,” Longoria told Marie Claire in an interview for its November cover story conducted two days after Trump triumphed in the presidential race.“It’s that a convicted criminal who spews so much hate could hold the highest office,” Longoria explained.Eva Longoria was born in Texas and spent her time between many countries living in both Spain and Mexico, but she lived her whole adult life in the US.Before the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Longoria said, the U.S. “was changing” and the “vibe was different.” “And then COVID happened, and it pushed it over the edge. Whether it’s the homelessness or the taxes, not that I want to s**t on California — it just feels like this chapter in my life is done now,” she said.""I get to escape and go somewhere. Most Americans aren't so lucky. They're going to be stuck in this dystopian country, and my anxiety and sadness is for them,"" she said to the publication.49-year-old Eva explained that she was mulling over the decision for sometime but the presidential election provided the final push.“It was like, ‘Does my vote really matter? Am I really making a difference?'” she said. “I was so untethered to the core of what I believe because I truly believed in my soul that the best person wins. And then that happened, and I was like, ‘Oh, wait. The best person doesn’t win.'”Longoria does not spend much time in Los Angeles and spends her time between Mexico and Spain with husband Jose Baston and their son, 6-year-old Santiago.","Eva Longoria was born in Texas and spent her time between many countries living in both Spain and Mexico, but she lived her whole adult life in the US.

Trump opens the Gaetz of hell after winning trifecta,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-opens-the-gaetz-of-hell-after-winning-trifecta/articleshow/115307656.cms,"TOI Correspondent from Washington:

MAGA supremo Donald Trump clinched a trifecta on Thursday, winning a narrow Republican majority in the House of Representatives in addition to bagging the White House and the Senate. But right from the get-go, the President-elect is testing the limits of his hold on the Grand Old Party (GOP) now infused with MAGA fervor, choosing controversial young loyalists for key posts in his upcoming administration in moves some Republican grandees see as outrageous.If Trump's pick of Tulsi Gabbard as the country's intelligence czar alarmed the US strategic community, his choice of Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz for the post of Attorney General has stunned even GOP lawmakers, some of whom have accused the Florida maverick of sexual misconduct and deviant behavior. At least two Republican lawmakers have explicitly accused Gaetz, 42, of sexual relations with underaged girls, with the spat on this issue pre-dating the 2024 elections.Moments after Trump named him on Wednesday as the putative Attorney General (he will have to be confirmed by the US Senate), Gaetz resigned from the Congressional seat he had just won from Florida, ostensibly to pre-empt a House Ethics Committee report relating to the allegations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug that was to be released shortly. The report cannot become public if he is not a member of the House (his resignation was accepted with alacrity by the Republican speaker), but anticipation of a media leak is keeping lawmakers on tenterhooks.Gaetz, and for that matter Tulsi Gabbard and Pete Hegseth, Trump's nominees for Director of National Intelligence and Defense Secretary respectively, will have to undergo a trial by fire in the US Senate confirmation hearings after the President-elect takes office on January 20, 2025. Technically, Presidential appointments for cabinet members and high-ranking administration posts have to be made ""with the advice and consent of the Senate,"" but Senators, who have long prided themselves on being independent-minded, can torpedo nominations by voting them down. The confirmation hearings are also preceded by extensive background checks by intelligence and security agencies, and nominations are often withdrawn if there are any adverse reports.Republicans will have a 53-47 majority in the Senate, and while a majority of the Senators are Trump loyalists , there are independent-minded holdouts who can trip up nominations if they consider them to be unqualified, national security risks, or pose a danger to the party's fortunes. Sometimes they do so out of personal pique.At least four Senators, including Iowa's Chuck Grassley (at 91, the oldest member), Maine's Susan Collins, and Alaska's Lisa Murkowski, appear to have reservations about some of Trump nominees, and along with anti-Trumper Mitt Romney, they could trip up the President. Perhaps anticipating this, Trump is insisting on powers to make recess appointments that would circumvent the confirmation process and allow him to install nominees without congressional hearings.“Any Republican Senator seeking the coveted LEADERSHIP position in the United States Senate must agree to Recess Appointments. IMMEDIATELY!” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform in a warning shot after MAGA’s preferred choice of Senate leader, Rick Scott, lost out to a more moderate John Thune. Trump's MAGA acolytes such as Senator Tommy Tuberville warned that lawmakers opposing the President-elect's choices will risk losing their seats, arguing that Trump had the mandate to make appointments as he chooses.The Gaetz nomination will be particularly fraught for Trump considering there has already been a circular firefight involving the Florida maverick and senior Republican lawmakers. After losing a scrap to be the House leader, Trump critic-turned-loyalist Kevin McCarthy said “I'll give you the truth why I'm not speaker. It's because one person, a member of Congress, wanted me to stop an ethics complaint because he slept with a 17-year-old.” Another GOP lawmaker, TonyGonzales from Texas, was more blunt on a tv show, saying, “I serve with some real scumbags. Matt Gaetz, he paid minors to have sex with him at drug parties.”","President-elect is testing the limits of his hold on the Grand Old Party.

Melania Trump’s second term as first lady won't be full-time in White House,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/melania-trumps-second-term-as-first-lady-wont-be-full-time-in-white-house-report/articleshow/115277202.cms,"Melania Trump is unlikely to reside full-time in Washington during her potential second tenure as first lady , demonstrating her independent approach to this unelected but prominent position.According to multiple sources who spoke to CNN, discussions about her living arrangements are still in progress.She has already declined the traditional meeting with current first lady Jill Biden at the White House, where President Biden hosted the president-elect on Wednesday. Despite Trump's team emphasising the importance of her attendance following Jill Biden's invitation, her office cited a book-related scheduling conflict. This was confirmed on X Wednesday morning.This decision suggests that Trump, who previously redefined the role during her first term, is establishing her independence early for her potential second tenure.""I'm not anxious because this time is different. I have much more experience and much more knowledge. I was in the White House before. When you go in, you know exactly what to expect,"" Trump said in a recent Fox News interview whilst promoting her memoir.Sources familiar with the situation indicate she plans to divide her time primarily between New York City and Palm Beach, Florida, rather than Washington, though they affirm she will maintain her first lady duties and attend significant events. Donald Trump is expected to continue his pattern of spending winter weekends at Mar-a-Lago and summer weekends at his Bedminster, New Jersey golf club. The Bidens have similarly split their time between Washington and Delaware, though maintaining the White House as their primary weekday residence.Sources indicate that Melania Trump has established a social circle in Florida over the past four years and is likely to maintain these connections.Following the 2016 election, she delayed her White House move until after her son Barron, then 10, completed his school year. Barron, now 18, attends New York University.Sources suggest she will spend considerable time at Trump Tower in New York to be near Barron. She was observed returning with him from Florida on the president-elect's private aircraft on Sunday.""I could not say I'm an empty nester. I don't feel that way,"" Melania Trump told Fox News' Ainsley Earhardt last month.""It was his decision to come here, that he wants to be in New York, study in New York, and live in his home and I respect that. … He's enjoying his college days. I hope he will have a great experience because his life is very different than any other 18-, 19-year-old child,"" she said.This unprecedented arrangement of a first lady choosing not to reside full-time at the White House aligns with Melania Trump's established pattern of non-traditional behaviour.","Melania Trump is unlikely to reside full-time in Washington during her potential second tenure as first lady.

US President-elect Donald Trump selected Tulsi Gabbard , an ex-Democratic congresswoman turned staunch supporter, as director of national intelligence on Wednesday. Gabbard , who holds the rank of lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve and has combat experience in Iraq, has consistently challenged established foreign policy views.Her selection reflects Trump's preference for appointing foreign policy sceptics who question American military interventions abroad.Trump's official announcement praised Gabbard's ""fearless spirit"" and her potential contribution to intelligence agencies , emphasising ""peace through strength."" The announcement noted her transition from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party , saying she switched ""because of President Trump's leadership and how he has been able to transform the Republican Party, bringing it back to the party of the people and the party of peace.""Roger Stone, Trump's long-time associate who received a presidential pardon in 2020, initially shared the news on his X account, publishing the statement he claimed came directly from Trump.If confirmed, Gabbard would work alongside John Ratcliffe, Trump's CIA director nominee, as a principal intelligence adviser to the White House. Her responsibilities would include managing 18 intelligence organisations and coordinating the President's Daily Brief, a crucial morning intelligence summary.At 43, Gabbard was born in American Samoa and raised in Hawaii, with a brief period in the Philippines. Her political career began at 21 in Hawaii's House of Representatives, interrupted by her National Guard deployment to Iraq.As the first Hindu member of the House, she took her oath on the ""Bhagavad Gita"". She also holds the distinction of being the first American Samoan in Congress. During her four terms, she notably challenged her party's leadership. Her early backing of senator Bernie Sanders' 2016 campaign elevated her national profile amongst progressives.Her family includes her spouse, cinematographer Abraham Williams, and her father, Mike Gabbard, a state senator who transitioned from Republican to Democrat.Her 2020 Democratic presidential campaign emphasised a progressive agenda and opposition to American military interventions. She highlighted how US Middle Eastern conflicts had destabilised the region and compromised American safety. During the primaries, she notably confronted then-senator Kamala Harris about her prosecutorial record.After withdrawing and supporting Biden's candidacy, she later left the Democratic Party, criticising it as controlled by ""an elitist cabal of warmongers"" and ""woke"" ideologues. She subsequently aligned with Republicans, joined Fox News, and launched a podcast.""Today's Democratic Party is unrecognisable from the party I joined 20 years ago,"" she said regarding her departure.Her endorsement of Trump this year significantly boosted her standing among his supporters. Frequently appearing with Robert F Kennedy Jr, Gabbard exemplified Trump's claimed cross-party appeal. She assisted Trump's debate preparation against Harris and publicly announced her Republican Party membership at a North Carolina rally in October, describing the Democratic Party as ""completely unrecognizable"".Trump has included both Gabbard and Kennedy in his transition team, potentially influencing staffing and policy decisions in a future administration.Gabbard's military career spans over twenty years in the Army National Guard, including deployments to Iraq and Kuwait. She received recognition with a Combat Medical Badge in 2005 for service during Operation Iraqi Freedom III, as confirmed by the Hawaii National Guard.Unlike her predecessors, she lacks senior government experience, though she served two years on the House Homeland Security Committee.The current director, Avril Haines, confirmed in 2021, brought extensive national security and intelligence experience and made history as the first female director.Trump intends to restructure intelligence services, which he views with scepticism. He attributes past challenges to intelligence agencies' alleged interference with his previous administration and campaigns.He frequently references the ""deep state"", describing career civil servants whom he considers insufficiently loyal. ""We will clean out all of the corrupt actors in our national security and intelligence apparatus, and there are plenty of them,"" Trump declared in 2023, outlining second-term priorities.The director's role, established in 2004 post-9/11, aims to enhance interagency cooperation and prevent intelligence failures. The office has been crucial in identifying and exposing disinformation from Russia, China, and Iran regarding voting and democracy before recent elections. Its responsibilities extend to cybersecurity, counterterrorism, and counterespionage","Tulsi Gabbard is the first Hindu member of the House of Representatives.

US Election 2024 Results: 'Nostradamus' Allan Lichtman blames Elon Musk after getting US election result wrong,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nostradamus-allan-litchman-blames-elon-musk-after-getting-us-election-result-wrong/articleshow/115302097.cms,"Lichtman’s Prediction Shock



Inside the “Keys to the White House” Model



Concerns Over Democracy



Evaluating the Keys: A System Under Strain



Reflections on a Missed Prediction and Changing Political Dynamics



The Fragility of Democracy in the 21st Century



Allan Lichtman , often referred to as the ""Nostradamus"" of US Presidential Polls, has attributed his incorrect prediction—suggesting Vice President Kamala Harris would win the US election—to disinformation and billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk. Lichtman, renowned for his accurate forecasting of nine out of the last ten US elections, had correctly predicted nine out of ten election outcomes. However, last week, the historian and political scientist’s prediction that Kamala Harris would win the US Presidential election proved incorrect, with Republican Donald Trump returning to the White House.Speaking with News Nation, Allan Lichtman, a professor at American University, elaborated on the reasons for his incorrect forecast, citing conservative media platforms and Elon Musk, who reportedly invested millions in Donald Trump’s campaign, as contributing factors. Lichtman also criticised Musk for amplifying disinformation online on topics such as immigration, hurricane relief, and the war in Ukraine, ""tipping the scales,"" as the News Nation report noted.“Disinformation is the primary issue,” Lichtman stated during an appearance on Chris Cuomo’s NewsNation show. “We’ve always had disinformation, but it’s now reached unprecedented levels. Much of the grievances this election were fuelled by it.” He continued, “Scholars have shown that when truth dissolves, democracy follows. Authoritarian regimes take hold not through force but through the manipulation of information, as George Orwell warned in 1984, where war is peace and famine is plenty.”""The basis of my system, the Keys to the White House, is that a rational, pragmatic electorate assesses if the governing party deserves another four years. But when disinformation drives the electorate's view of that party, especially from individuals with immense financial influence, perhaps the foundation of the Keys needs re-evaluation,"" Lichtman concluded.For over forty years, Allan Lichtman has used his ""Keys to the White House"" model with remarkable accuracy, having correctly predicted every presidential winner since 1984. The 77-year-old American University professor was confident that Kamala Harris would win the 2024 election, with his model’s indicators pointing towards a Democratic victory. However, as the results confirmed Trump’s sweeping win, Lichtman found himself blindsided, live-streaming his disbelief with his son, Sam. The political forecaster was left questioning what had gone wrong, joking, “Good thing I’ve nothing on tomorrow. No interviews for me.”American historian Allan Lichtman, often dubbed the ""Nostradamus of US elections,"" was left speechless when his prediction of Kamala Harris’ victory in the 2024 US Presidential Elections was proven incorrect. Lichtman and his son, Sam, hosted a six-hour YouTube livestream, during which he expressed his bewilderment, saying, “I don’t get it,” as Trump moved steadily towards a victory.Visibly tired and disappointed by the outcome, Lichtman remarked, “Good thing I’ve nothing to do tomorrow. And I’m not doing any interviews.” He added, “The democracy is gone.” Meanwhile, battles in Nevada, North Carolina, and Arizona remained “too close to call.”Reflecting on the state of democracy, Lichtman noted, “Once democracy is gone, it’s almost impossible to recover. The way to recover is by dictators losing wars.” On 6 November, Republican candidate and former President Donald Trump clinched a historic victory, surpassing the majority required to defeat Kamala Harris. Trump celebrated the outcome as a “magnificent victory for the American people,” thanking his supporters.Lichtman expressed his frustration, hoping that Trump would serve his term and that “we never have to deal with him again.” He struggled to comprehend “how that many people can just ignore all the stuff he did in 2020,” describing Trump as “too lazy to govern the country.” Wrapping up the livestream, Lichtman urged, “Democracy is precious, but like all precious things, it can be destroyed. And typically destroyed from within. Throughout the 21st century, democracy has been in decline globally, and America has now joined that trend. But never give up hope. Never stop striving. Never stop trying, especially you young people.”For more than four decades, Lichtman’s ""Keys to the White House"" model has enjoyed a strong track record of accuracy, correctly predicting each presidential winner since 1984. The 77-year-old American University professor expected Harris to win in 2024, relying on the model’s indicators that favoured a Democratic outcome. But Trump’s decisive victory left Lichtman surprised, live-streaming his dismay alongside his son, Sam.Lichtman’s prediction model, the ""13 Keys to the White House,"" is based on 13 true-or-false indicators that assess conditions favouring the incumbent party. If six or more of these keys turn “false,” the model predicts a loss for the incumbent. The keys encompass factors like economic performance, social stability, candidate charisma, and major policy achievements. Lichtman believed Harris had eight keys in her favour, while Trump fell short on several counts, pointing to a clear Democratic path to victory.In his forecast, Lichtman highlighted Harris’s strengths in areas like “No Primary Contest,” “Strong Long-term Economy,” and “No Foreign or Military Failures.” These indicators usually benefit the incumbent party when stable or positive. Yet, despite these favourable indicators, the electorate leaned unexpectedly towards Trump, leading to his decisive win. This miss by the ""Keys"" model underscores its limitations in capturing an increasingly unpredictable political climate.As the election results became evident, Lichtman’s initial disbelief turned into deeper concerns about democracy’s future. During the livestream, he lamented, “Oh, democracy’s gone,” voicing his fears of an era marked by the fragility of democratic institutions. His apprehensions went beyond his failed prediction, revealing a broader concern about the future of democratic governance, especially given Trump’s divisive leadership style and its impact on political norms.Lichtman pointed out that once democracy erodes, restoring it becomes a significant challenge. He referenced historical cases where authoritarian regimes ended only after substantial upheavals, like wars or social revolutions. His son, Sam, tried to reassure him, optimistically suggesting that Trump’s influence might diminish post-presidency. But Lichtman remained sceptical, warning that “Democracy is precious, but like all precious things, it can be destroyed.” He noted the troubling global trend of eroding democratic norms throughout the 21st century.Since its creation, Lichtman’s model has been celebrated as a strong alternative to traditional polling, which often misses subtle shifts in voter sentiment. Developed from a study of presidential elections from 1860 to 1980, the ""Keys to the White House"" model aimed to cut through polling noise and focus on the broader factors that shape elections. The model’s 13 true/false questions support or oppose the incumbent’s chances, with “true” answers favouring the incumbent party. Key factors include economic stability, absence of scandals, and whether the challenger is charismatic.Below are some key indicators that Lichtman considered crucial:Party Mandate – Incumbents often gain an advantage if they hold a strong congressional majority after midterms.No Primary Contest – Indicates party unity, favouring the incumbent.Strong Long-term Economy – If the economy shows steady growth, it generally supports the incumbent.No Social Unrest – A stable social environment benefits the incumbent.No Scandal – Absence of scandals maintains public trust.Uncharismatic Challenger – This benefits the incumbent if the challenger lacks charisma.In 2024, Lichtman assessed that Harris had eight keys in her favour, indicating a Democratic win. However, the result suggests that underlying political and social dynamics were more complex than the model could capture.With Trump’s victory now a reality, Lichtman’s rare error may highlight how shifting political dynamics affect the reliability of traditional forecasting. Modern elections increasingly present unexpected factors, like disinformation, polarisation, and changing voter loyalty. While historically insightful, Lichtman’s model may face challenges in adapting to the electorate’s evolving motivations.Additionally, the 2024 election was marked by heightened emotion and intense division across party lines. Trump’s divisive but impactful rhetoric appealed to many voters disillusioned with the status quo. Although Harris appeared to have the advantage, voter sentiment ultimately leaned towards a familiar figure promising change, despite his controversial approach.For Lichtman, the 2024 result symbolises more than a missed prediction. His comments on democracy’s precarious state underscore a broader concern: that American democracy, like others worldwide, is under strain. Rising polarisation, erosion of institutional norms, and the spread of populism have altered the landscape. Lichtman worries these trends could destabilise democracy if left unchecked.The historian’s warnings echo broader anxieties about the potential consequences of leadership that disregards democratic values. He urged vigilance, reminding those who value democracy not to lose hope. While democracy is fragile, it can also be resilient—if people remain committed to protecting it.In uncertain times, Lichtman’s insights remind us that no model is infallible, but the continued pursuit of truth, transparency, and democratic values is essential. As he concluded, “Never give up hope.” This sentiment transcends his prediction, offering a hopeful message to those committed to upholding democracy in an unpredictable world.","Allan Lichtman, often referred to as the ""Nostradamus"" of US Presidential Polls, has attributed his incorrect prediction to disinformation and billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk. The 77-year-old American University professor was confident that Kamala Harris would win the 2024 election, with his model’s indicators pointing towards a Democratic victory. The historian and political scientist was left speechless, live-streaming his disbelief with his son.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115302130,imgsize-114370,width-400,resizemode-4/115302130.jpg"

'Gaetz won't get confirmed, everyone knows that'

Among the appointments that President-elect Donald Trump made so far, Matt Gaetz for attorney general is the most controversial one as Republicans too don't like him. The 42-year-old has been under investigation by the House of Representatives' ethics committee over allegations he was part of a scheme that led to the sex trafficking of a 17-year-old girl.But more sensational claims have surfaced on social media including one of a 'dead roommate'. According to a 2016 report, Matt Gaetz's roommate at Florida State University was reportedly found dead under suspicious circumstances while they were undergraduate students. The death was investigated as a possible homicide but was ruled as a suicide.Matt Gaetz resigned from Congress Wednesday ""effective immediately"" hours after he was announced as the next attorney general. The resignation came just in time when the House Ethics Committee was preparing to release a report on sexual misconduct and drug allegations against him. His resignation will end the investigation that started in April 2021.Gaetz will need a Senate majority vote to become attorney general and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy said everyone is certain that he won't get confirmed by the Senate.Democratic Senator John Fetterman described Matt Gaetz's nomination as a ""god-tier"" level of trolling by Tryno to ""own the libs in perpetuity"". “I mean, I would describe it as god-tier level trolling, that has triggered a full-on China Syndrome to own the libs in perpetuity,” Fetterman told an NBC reporter. Elon Musk shared the viral clip of Fetterman's reaction.“I was shocked at the nomination,” Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) told Punchbowl News. “This is why the Senate’s advise-and-consent process is so important. I’m sure that there will be many, many questions raised at Mr. Gaetz’s hearing.” “Are you s***ting me?” Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho) also told the Huffington Post when pressed for his reaction.","Matt Gaetz resigned from Congress Wednesday ""effective immediately"" hours after he was announced as the next attorney general.

A video of a bride and groom entering their nearly empty wedding reception has been going viral on social media this week. The bride, Kalina Marie , a TikTok user from Oregon, US, has shared her heartbreak, revealing that she is cutting ties with several friends after the incident.Kalina Marie and her husband arrived at their reception two hours after the scheduled start time, only to find just five guests present. The venue had been prepared for 40 attendees, according to a New York Post report.“FIVE PEOPLE SHOWED UP!!!!!!! Like, are you kidding me!?!? As you see in the video, we enter the venue, and no one is there. The invite said 1 pm. My mom messaged me at 1:15 pm saying no one was there.

Patrick Mahomes addresses the burglaries at his and Travis Kelce's homes

Patrick Mahomes , the Super Bowl-winning quarterback, claims he is upset following a burglary at his estate in Belton, Missouri. It occurred around midnight on Monday, October 6. Mahomes was out enjoying himself celebrating his friend Travis Kelce 's 35th birthday at a comedy show. It is unknown whether the athlete, his wife Brittany Mahomes, or any of their children were home at the time of the breakin, but he didn't indicate where he was during Wednesday's press conference.A week after Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and tight end Travis Kelce endured defeats that did nothing to matter, they were sitting at 9-0 for the season after a third consecutive season of winning the first nine games of the season. They are headed toward yet another deep playoff run. But they are also having to live with what both suffered in the October burglaries at their homes, hours apart, Belton, Missouri, and Leawood, Kansas, respectively.Mahomes provided his perspective on the burglaries that resulted in the theft of $20,000 in cash from Kelce. ""Obviously it’s frustrating, disappointing,"" Mahomes said via David K. Li of NBC News. ""I can't get into too many of the details because the investigation is still ongoing. But obviously it's something that you don’t want to happen to, really anybody, but obviously yourself.”The incident occurred while Mahomes was out celebrating his friend Travis Kelce's 35th birthday at a comedy show. It's unclear if the athlete or his pregnant wife, Brittany Mahomes, and their children were home at the time, and Patrick has not confirmed his whereabouts. “I can’t speak too much about the details of everything with the investigation going on but I’m sure at some point that will be talked about,” he further said.Also Read: Chiefs' Travis Kelce and Patrick Mahomes each had their Kansas and Missouri homes burglarized in October Kelce has remained silent on the subject so far, but acknowledged that his rear door had also been broken into besides the theft of the cash. The tight end's family and friends-which including girlfriend Taylor Swift were all in town for his birthday. They likely were all at the game when the burglary took place.

President-elect Donald Trump now has a new team and also a new friend circle that begins and ends with Elon Musk, the First Buddy, who has been seen at Mar-a-Lago almost every day since the election results came -- sometimes with his son X, sometimes with Trump's granddaughter Kai and then he was seen at a dinner with Trump and Melania. All these have made Elon Musk the 'First Buddy' -- apart from his crucial role in the Department of Government Efficiency.Reports said Musk's proximity to the Trump family has iced out many old-timers who used to be in Trump's inner circle but Melania likes Elon Musk's presence at Mar-a-Lago, reports said.The advisers Trump used to eat with before are nowhere to be seen and the former regulars at Mar-a-Lago are feeling left out with the new equations, Page Six reported.""Trump loved pitting people -- even his friends -- against each other. Everyone is jealous of Elon. His close associates are a tad miffed they have lost their prime seat next to the President-elect,"" the report said citing a source. Though no one is losing their job because of Elon Musk as he's already got DOGE which will help the government from the outside, there are mixed feelings about Musk.Only Melania Trump reportedly is very approving of Elon Musk and she's apparently a big fan of the Tesla boss. The report said Melania likes Elon and has been around more.On Wednesday, Donald Trump too cracked a joke that Elon won't go home. ""I can’t get rid of him — at least until I don’t like him,"" he said.Karoline Leavitt, the spokesperson of former Trump campaign and now the transition team, said Musk and Trump are great friends.

KYIV: The toll from a massive Russian attack that set apartments alight and knocked out heating to thousands in Ukraine's southern port city of Odesa rose to one dead and 10 wounded, authorities said Friday.The Thursday night strikes on the Black Sea city damaged residential buildings, the heating system, churches and educational institutions, according to Odesa Mayor Gennadiy Trukhanov, who said it had been ""a massive combined enemy strike"".Trukhanov said early Friday that a 35-year-old woman sleeping near a window at the time of the attack had died.The State Emergency Service of Ukraine said another 10 people were wounded, including two children.Fires broke out in several places but were quickly extinguished, while the main heating pipeline was damaged, leaving tens of thousands in the cold as nightly temperatures plunge to freezing.""More than 40,000 people (as well as) medical and social institutions are without heating,"" Trukhanov wrote on Telegram. ""Generators and heaters are working in medical institutions.""The mayor's office said hot drinks and blankets were being distributed while the pipeline was restored.After fleeing during the air raid siren, Odesa resident Oleksandra said she saw pictures of her damaged home.""When everything happened, we were hiding in a shelter.

CCTV footage shows sudden acceleration

Devastating impact of the crash

Eyewitness account from restaurant owner

A split-second misjudgment

NEW DELHI: An after-party night out turned tragic on Monday when a rashly-driven multi-utility vehicle (MUV) snuffed out six young lives in Dehradun.The speeding MUV collided with a container truck, killing Guneet Singh, Kamakshi Singhal, Navya Goyal, Rishabh Jain and Atul Agrawal—all residents of Dehradun—and Kunal Kukreja from Chamba, Himachal Pradesh, instantly.The sole survivor, Siddhesh Agrawal, remains hospitalised in stable condition but is currently unable to recount details of the accident.The youngsters were returning from a party hosted by Siddhesh.Inspector KC Bhatt from the Cantt police station, who is heading the investigation, noted that early findings do not indicate fault by the truck driver. The collision occurred when the MUV, moving at high speed, struck the truck’s left rear side—a known blind spot on large vehicles.Bhatt added, “Since the MUV’s driver, who owned the vehicle, did not survive, we are looking into legal alternatives as no charges can be filed posthumously.”CCTV footage reveals the MUV initially driving at a moderate pace through checkpoints but accelerating sharply just before the crash near the ONGC intersection.The truck was seen moving steadily, covering 1.5 kilometers in six minutes, when the MUV struck it from behind.The force of the impact was so severe that it tore off the MUV’s roof, resulting in two passengers’ decapitation.The MUV was left mangled and twisted beyond recognition. Reports indicate that the group had been returning from a party hosted by Siddhesh, the sole survivor.A nearby restaurant owner recalls narrowly avoiding a collision with the MUV around 1 a.m. near Pacific Mall. “The car was speeding on the wrong side toward us. I had to swerve quickly,” he recounted.Alarmed by the recklessness, he alerted police at a nearby checkpoint but observed no action was taken. He later reported the incident via the emergency helpline and even emailed officials, including the SSP and CM’s office, but was devastated to learn the next morning that the same vehicle had been involved in the fatal accident.Based on the initial investigation, it appears the young driver of the MUV attempted to overtake another car, misjudging the timing.The police believe he tried to pass the truck before it crossed the intersection, leading to the fatal collision with the truck’s left side.","A rashly-driven multi-utility vehicle (MUV) snuffed out six young lives in Dehradun.

Sri Lanka's National People's Power (NPP) party, led by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake , is set secure majority in the parliamentary snap elections. By Friday at 6 am (local time), the NPP had secured 52 seats, with about 62 per cent of the national vote, totaling over 4.4 million votes. The party currently holds 35 seats through district-based proportional representation.The opposition parties have suffered significant losses, with the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) receiving 18 per cent and the National Democratic Front (NDF), supported by former president Ranil Wickremesinghe, obtaining less than 5 per cent of votes. The SJB has secured 8 seats, whilst the NDP has obtained just one seat.The Sri Lanka People's Front (SLPP), associated with the Rajapaksa family, has managed to secure 2 seats despite ranking fourth in the vote count.Political observers indicate that the NPP has achieved a substantial improvement compared to the September presidential election . They anticipate the party will surpass 150 seats, securing an absolute majority in the 225-member assembly.As the island nation awaits the final results for the elections held on November 14, Dissanayake's NPP, founded in 2019, is vying to secure a majority to implement key anti-poverty reforms and tackle economic challenges following Sri Lanka’s severe financial crisis. This crisis led to the ousting of former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa in 2022 and prompted a $2.9 billion IMF bailout.Dissanayake, who won the presidency in September, faces opposition from Sajith Premadasa's United People's Power and conservative factions. A win for the NPP would mark the first time a leftist coalition controls both the presidency and parliament, potentially shifting Sri Lanka’s policies toward a socialist approach and redefining its international relations, particularly with China and India.","Sri Lanka's National People's Power (NPP) party, led by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, is set secure majority in the parliamentary snap elections.

Secrecy, strain



BEIJING: China's economic malaise is fuelling social tensions that make people more likely to commit violent crimes out of anger or desperation, analysts say, after the country witnessed its deadliest massacre in a decade.The country has experienced a spate of violent attacks this year, challenging Beijing's proud reputation for public order and prompting online soul-searching about the state of society.On Monday, a man ploughed a car into crowds at a sports complex in the southern city of Zhuhai, killing 35 and wounding 43, according to official figures.It followed a string of similar crimes as China struggles to revive economic growth, keep people employed and boost confidence since it ended rigid Covid curbs in late 2022.""The recent spate of violent attacks in China is a reflection of its worsening social and macroeconomic conditions,"" said Hanzhang Liu, an assistant professor of political studies at Pitzer College in the United States.""Although these incidents are sporadic in nature, the increasing frequency at which they happen does suggest that more people in China are suffering from hardships and desperation that they have not previously experienced,"" she told AFP.Signs of economic distress have multiplied in China in recent years, from capital flight and emigration to rising joblessness, anger at expensive housing and childcare, and youth cultures glorifying low expectations and rejecting the rat race.Lynette Ong, distinguished professor of Chinese politics at Canada's University of Toronto and senior fellow at the Asia Society, said violent attacks were the ""negative side of the same coin"".""These are symptoms of a society with a lot of pent-up grievances,"" Ong told AFP. ""Some people resort to giving up. Others, if they're angry, want to take revenge.""The problem was ""very new to China"", she said, adding that the country may be tipping ""towards a different type of society, an uglier society"".Police said initial enquiries showed the perpetrator of Monday's rampage was a 62-year-old man ""dissatisfied"" with a divorce settlement.In other cases, a middle-aged man used a knife and firearm to kill at least 21 people in eastern Shandong province in February, and a 55-year-old man rammed a car into a crowd in the central city of Changsha in July, killing eight, following a property dispute.A 50-year-old man wounded five in a knife attack at a school in Beijing last month; a 37-year-old man fatally stabbed three and injured 15 in a Shanghai supermarket in September; and a 44-year-old unemployed man fatally knifed a Japanese schoolboy in Shenzhen the same month.In some cases, the motives remain unclear or undisclosed, while scant media coverage and widespread online censorship have hampered understanding of the problem's potential social roots.But the attacks have revealed the limits of a nationwide system of surveillance cameras and data-driven policing that roots out public security threats.Suzanne Scoggins, an associate professor of political science at Clark University in the United States, said the recent attacks showed that ""there is no such thing as an all-seeing, all-knowing police state"".Minxin Pei, a professor at California's Claremont McKenna College, told AFP that ""the system is very good at watching known threats, but it does a poor job dealing with previously unknown or unidentified threats"".""The man who killed so many people in Zhuhai most probably was not known as a threat to the police,"" said Pei, who also authored ""The Sentinel State"", a book on surveillance in China.President Xi Jinping called on officials to prevent ""extreme cases"" after Monday's attack, while Beijing's foreign ministry repeated that the country is ""one of the safest"" in the world.China's official murder rate last year was 0.46 cases per 100,000 people, compared to 5.7 in the United States.Still, authorities swiftly extinguished commemorations of the Zhuhai incident, clearing public memorials and quashing online discussion.Analysts said the censorship was a reflexive state response to deter copycat violence and prevent official embarrassment.""The Chinese state's default modus operandi is secrecy,"" said Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London.Liu, of Pitzer College, called the violence a ""thorny challenge"" to Beijing as it addresses the economic slowdown.China typically responds to social instability by bolstering public security and surveillance systems, she told AFP.But with the government facing ""unprecedented fiscal woes"", this would only put more pressure on drained public coffers, Liu said.","China's economic malaise is fuelling social tensions that make people more likely to commit violent crimes, analysts say.

(Photo/Agencies)

North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has instructed the ""mass production"" of suicide attack drones , according to state media reports on Friday, after he observed a test of the system the day before.Kim supervised tests of drones intended to hit both land and sea targets, which were developed by North Korea's Unmanned Aerial Technology Complex (UATC).""He underscored the need to build a serial production system as early as possible and go into full-scale mass production,"" said the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).""Suicide drones"" are drones equipped with explosives and designed to crash into enemy targets, functioning similarly to guided missiles.Also referred to as loitering munitions, these weapons have been widely used in the war in Ukraine and in the Middle East.North Korea displayed these suicide drones for the first time in August, with experts suggesting this capability may be due to North Korea’s increasing alliance with Russia. North Korea and Russia have recently ratified a comprehensive strategic partnership that their leaders signed in June, which includes a mutual defence pact.""The suicide attack drones to be used within different striking ranges are to perform a mission to precisely attack any enemy targets on the ground and in the sea,"" KCNA said.Kim described the drones as an ""easy to use... component of striking power,"" citing their relatively low cost and wide range of applications, as reported by KCNA.In 2022, North Korea sent drones across the border, and South Korea’s military was unable to shoot them down, citing their small size. South Korea has since established a drone operations command to address this growing threat.Earlier this year, North Korea accused South Korea of infringing on its sovereignty by flying drones over its territory to drop propaganda leaflets, an allegation denied by South Korea's military.In October, North Korea modified its constitution to designate South Korea as a ""hostile"" state, reflecting worsening relations since Kim declared Seoul his country's ""principal enemy"" in January.","North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has instructed the ""mass production"" of suicide attack drones.

On the morning that Hamas raided Israel last year, a top Israeli general called his prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to tell him that hundreds of militants appeared to be preparing to invade. Now, aides to the PM are under investigation for altering details about that call in the official record of Netanyahu’s activities that day, according to four officials briefed on the investigation.The investigation is seen as deeply sensitive in Israel, where the question of what Netanyahu knew in advance of Hamas’ invasion, and when he was told, could prove crucial to his political future. It is expected to play a key part in a postwar assessment of the role political and military leaders may have played in one of the worst military failures in Israel’s history. The accusation is just one of several levelled at PM’s aides in recent weeks. While Netanyahu himself is not a subject of a police inquiry, officials in his office are under investigation for trying to bolster his reputation throughout Israel’s war with Hamas by leaking classified military documents, altering official transcripts of his conversations and intimidating people who controlled access to those records.Though disparate and complex, the cases have helped foster the impression among Netanyahu’s critics that his team has used illicit means to improve how he is perceived, at the expense of either the truth or national security, or both. Netanyahu and his office have denied the accusations, countering that it is his accusers who, by spreading falsehoods, have undermined Israel at a time of national peril. The full extent of the new claims has not been revealed as most of them are subject to a gag order.","Aides to Benjamin Netanyahu are under investigation for altering details about that call in the official record of Netanyahu’s activities. The investigation is seen as deeply sensitive in Israel, where the question of what Netanyahu knew in advance of Hamas’ invasion could prove crucial to his political future.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115318813,imgsize-1628362,width-400,resizemode-4/115318813.jpg"
