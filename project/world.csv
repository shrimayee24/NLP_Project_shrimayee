A broader pattern of violence

NEW DELHI: In a concerning escalation of violence, Jammu and Kashmir has witnessed multiple terror attacks over the past two days, prompting security forces to intensify their operations in the region. The attacks have resulted in injuries to several security personnel and have raised alarm among local political leaders .A Pakistani terrorist belonging to the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) was killed during an encounter in the Khanyar area of Srinagar on Saturday morning. Security forces launched a cordon and search operation following intelligence regarding the presence of terrorists. As the operation unfolded, the terrorists opened fire, prompting a retaliatory response from the security forces.""During the operation, a fire broke out in the house where the terrorists were holed up, creating a thick plume of smoke,"" an official reported. The slain terrorist was noted to be one of the senior-most members of the LeT, according to a senior police officer.Two Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel and two policemen sustained injuries and were transported to the Army's 92 Base Hospital, where their condition remains stable.In a separate incident, security forces neutralized two more terrorists in Anantnag during an ongoing anti-terrorist operation in the Halkan Gali area. ""Based on specific input, a Joint Operation was launched by the Indian Army, Jammu and Kashmir Police, and the CRPF. The terrorists opened indiscriminate fire on our troops, which led to effective retaliation,"" the Chinar Corps reported on X.The operation continues in Anantnag, with further updates expected as the situation develops.Two labourers from Uttar Pradesh were shot at by terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir's Budgam district on Friday evening, officials said. Sufiyan and Usman were injured after they came under attack in the Mazhama area of Magam in the central Kashmir district, they said, adding that the duo were taken to a hospital, where their condition was stated to be stable.This was the fifth terror attack in the Kashmir valley since a new government was formed in the Union Territory last month.The recent wave of attacks has sparked condemnation from various political figures.Chief minister Omar Abdullah and National Conference (NC) President Farooq Abdullah expressed their sorrow over the attack on civilians in Mazhama, Budgam, where two non-local labourers were shot by terrorists.He also demanded an investigation in Budgam terror attack and said that he have a doubt that is it done by the people who were trying to destabilise the government in Jammu and Kashmir.""It should be investigated. How is it that the government has come and this is happening? I have a doubt that is it done by the people who were trying to destabilise the government...If they (terrorists) are caught then we will get to know who is doing this. They should not be killed, they should be caught and asked who is behind them...We should check if there is an agency who is trying to destabilise Omar Abdullah,"" Farooq Abdullah said.Former Deputy CM Kavinder Gupta described the attack as a cowardly attack during festivities.""There are some people here who are working as per the instructions of Pakistan, this is a cowardly attack on a festive occasion. This is wrong...there is a need to identify people who are carrying out these attacks. There are so many people here who still work as Over Ground Workers and Underground Workers,"" he said.NC MP Aga Syed Ruhullah Mehdi also questioned the sudden rise in attacks post-elections, asserting that the BJP regime should be held accountable for the security situation in Jammu and Kashmir. ""Why this sudden rise in these attacks immediately after the recent elections?"" he asked.Jammu and Kashmir Congress chief Tariq Hameed Karra condemned the violence, calling it ""most unfortunate,"" while Apni Party president Altaf Bukhari described the attack as ""the worst form of cowardice.""The Peoples' Conference, led by Sajad Lone, also condemned the violence, labeling it as ""senseless."" ""We strongly condemn the cowardly attack on two innocent individuals who were shot at by militants in Budgam,"" the party stated.Terming the recent terror attacks in Jammu and Kashmir as ""unfortunate"", Union defence minister Rajnath Singh said there is no security lapse, adding that security forces are giving befitting reply to the terrorists.Singh claimed that the number of attacks taking place in the valley have been reduced compared to the earlier times.Speaking to reporters in UP's Kanpur, Singh said, ""This is not an issue of security lapses. Compared to earlier times, attacks have been reduced. Our security forces are on alert, such a situation will come that from there (J-K) terror activities will be fully wiped out and J&K will develop fast.""""The attacks that happened were unfortunate, our security forces are giving befitting reply also, so many terrorists have been killed,"" he said.After a terrorist attack in Budgam district, Jammu and Kashmir National Conference leader and MP from Srinagar Ruhullah Mehdi said that the central-led BJP government should be held responsible for the attack.However, he expressed grief over the attacks and extended his prayers to the victims and their families.Holding the BJP responsible for the recent attack, Mehdi further alleged that there was an increase in attacks immediately after the recent legislative elections concluded in the territory in which the NC-Congress alliance won a majority and formed their government.In a post on X, Mehdi wrote, ""Saddened by the news of the terrorist attack on the civilians in Mazhama Budgam. My sympathies and prayers with the victims and their families. The BJP regime which is directly in control of the security in J&K should be held accountable for these repeated failures. Also want to ask why this sudden rise in these attacks immediately after the recent elections?""These incidents are part of a broader pattern of violence in the region. Since the formation of a new government last month, this marks the fifth terror attack in Kashmir. Previous attacks included the tragic deaths of two soldiers and two Army porters on October 24 and the killing of a doctor along with six construction workers on October 20.As security operations continue and investigations unfold, the local populace remains on edge, grappling with the harsh realities of ongoing violence in their communities.","Two labourers from Uttar Pradesh were shot at by terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir's Budgam district on Friday evening.

Additionally, Nursing officer Rajkumari and ward assistant Chhoti Bai Thakur have been suspended with immediate effect.The CMHO, Dr. Ramesh Maravi, addressed the incident, saying, ""This took place on 31 October. Following complaints from the woman’s relatives, notices have been issued to the medical officer, nursing officer, and ward assistant involved. We will forward their replies to the District Magistrate and proceed with any necessary actions.""The case drew attention after a video surfaced showing Roshni Marawi, the pregnant widow of Shivraj Marawi , cleaning the bloodied hospital bed. Shivraj, 40, was taken to Gardasari health centre for emergency treatment following a brutal attack that left three family members dead due to a land dispute. He died shortly after his arrival.Reports indicate that the violent attack, involving 25 assailants armed with sticks, rods, and axes, took place on 31 October in Lalpur Sani village. Shivraj, his father, and his brother were attacked over an ongoing land dispute that had been resolved in the family’s favour by a 2018 court ruling. The attackers, identified as relatives, allegedly sought revenge by ambushing the family as they approached their paddy field.Dr. Chandrashekhar Tekam of the health centre later commented to the media that Roshni was not explicitly instructed to clean the bed but may have collected blood-stained materials to preserve evidence. Nonetheless, the viral video spurred outrage, leading to immediate disciplinary measures.The police have arrested four suspects and continue searching for three more individuals involved.",The chief medical and health officer of Dindori has taken disciplinary action following a disturbing incident.

KANPUR: A newborn boy, now known as Krishna, has captivated the hearts of hospital staff and onlookers across Hamirpur and Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh with his miraculous survival story. Born under uncertain circumstances and abandoned shortly thereafter, Krishna was discovered clinging to life in the branches of a tree after being thrown from a bridge in Hamirpur.When rescued, he bore roughly 50 injuries and a serious bite wound on his back - possibly crows - that left him in critical condition. Krishna's unlikely saviour was the large tree by the bridge, which cushioned his fall and saved him from an otherwise fatal plunge. The tiny child held on.The baby was rushed to Hamirpur's district hospital before being referred to Lala Lajpat Rai (LLR) Hospital in Kanpur. The infant's arrival at LLR on Aug 26, coinciding with Janmashtami that celebrates the birth of Lord Krishna, inspired staff members to name him after the beloved deity. As the staff worked tirelessly to nurse him back to health, Krishna became much more than just a patient to them - he became family.During his two-month stay at LLR, the medical teams formed deep emotional bonds with Krishna. Nurses sang lullabies from a distance to soothe his cries.""When we finally held him, it was on the day of his discharge. We are overjoyed with his recovery and wish him all the happiness in life,"" said neonatal ICU nurse Lakshmi, who developed a particularly strong connection with Krishna.Against the odds, Krishna's recovery was complete after six weeks of dedicated care. On Oct 25, the emotional moment of his departure was shared by the hospital staff, many of whom shed tears as he was handed over to police and the child welfare committee.","A newborn boy, now known as Krishna, has captivated the hearts of hospital staff and onlookers across Uttar Pradesh.

What is the Blue Wall?



Importance of Electoral College Votes



Pennsylvania

Michigan

Wisconsin

Stakes in 2024

For the latest updates, check out our comprehensive guide on the US Election:

As the United States inches closer to its 2024 general election , the concept of the "" Blue Wall "" is becoming a central focus in the fight between the Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris , and the Republican contender, former President Donald Trump Both campaigns have poured resources into these pivotal states, given their critical role in determining who will secure the presidency.The ""Blue Wall"" refers to a cluster of states that consistently voted for the Democratic presidential candidate from 1992 through 2012. However, this long-standing trend was disrupted in 2016 when Trump managed to flip three key states: Pennsylvania , Michigan , and Wisconsin .These states, with a combined total of 44 electoral votes, were instrumental in Trump’s victory over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 elections, as he won 306 electoral college votes despite losing the national popular vote by nearly 2.9 million.In 2020, President Joe Biden managed to rebuild the Blue Wall, winning back these states and securing an electoral vote count of 306, the same margin Trump had achieved four years earlier. Biden’s national popular vote lead extended to over 7 million, but the Blue Wall states remained hotly contested battlegrounds.Now, in 2024, these states are once again at the heart of the electoral struggle.To win the presidency, a candidate needs at least 270 of the 538 available electoral college votes. Each state is allocated a certain number of votes based on its congressional representation, with all but two states following a winner-takes-all system.While both parties have strongholds, Democrats rely on the 18 states, plus Washington, DC, that have consistently supported them, amounting to 238 electoral votes.Republicans, on the other hand, hold a solid base of 218 votes from the South and interior states, though they tend to be less populated and carry fewer electoral votes.This state has 19 Electoral Votes.Historically, a Republican hadn’t won Pennsylvania since 1988 before Trump’s victory in 2016. Biden reclaimed the state in 2020, beating Trump 50 per cent to 48.8 per cent.This battleground state has 15 Electoral Votes.Like Pennsylvania, Michigan hadn’t gone red since 1988 until Trump’s narrow win in 2016. Biden flipped it back in 2020, securing 50.6 per cent of the vote to Trump’s 47.8 per cent.This key state has 10 Electoral Votes.Before Trump’s victory in 2016, no Republican had won Wisconsin since 1984. Biden recaptured the state in 2020, narrowly defeating Trump 49.6 per cent to 48.9 per cent.As per USA Today , polls suggest the Blue Wall states are once again too close to call. If Trump manages to breach this wall like he did in 2016, he stands a strong chance of winning the presidency.Conversely, if Harris can hold these states for the Democrats, her path to victory becomes much clearer.As Election Day approaches, the eyes of the nation—and the world—will be on Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, the blue wall trio that could tip the scales in one of the most closely contested elections in recent history.","The ""Blue Wall"" refers to a cluster of states that consistently voted for the Democratic presidential candidate from 1992 through 2012.

: Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, a female Democrat, has opened an investigation into comments by MAGA supremo Donald Trump wondering how ""war hawk"" Liz Cheney would feel if guns were ""trained on her face"" as a potentially prosecutable offense, amid a raging gender clash in the US Presidential election.""I have already asked my criminal division chief to start looking at that statement, analyzing it for whether it qualifies as a death threat under Arizona's laws,"" Mayes said in a TV interview even as Kamala Harris said such violent rhetoric should be disqualifying. Her campaign managers added that it was tantamount to suggesting Cheney be put before a firing squad.""Think about the contrast. You have Trump talking about sending a prominent Republican to the firing squad... Vice president Harris is talking about sending one to her Cabinet,"" Harris' senior advisor Ian Sams said.Political pundits and gun experts are still trying to figure out what liberal critics say is Trump's purported ""execution fantasy"" in which he wanted Cheney to face ""nine barrels."" A firing squad can vary in number. Most states have outlawed firing squads. The last death by firing squad took place in Utah in 2010. But the comment has triggered outrage in Democratic ranks, particularly women, and Harris supporters hope it will rouse at least some female Trump supporters who appear to have no problems with his rhetoric.Polls show Harris leading by an average of 11 points among women while Trump leads by 10 points among men — a 21-point gap in the vote margin. Women make up a larger share of the US electorate than men. Early voting data in the current election, where almost 70 million voters have already cast ballots, shows women making up about 55 percent of early voters in battleground states. This is offset by Trump running about five points ahead among men than he did against Biden in 2020.Although Kamala Harris has been careful not to emphasize gender (or race and ethnicity for that matter) contours of a women v men battle has taken shape with Harris surrogates suggesting MAGA women should voter for her in defiance of their domineering spouses.The 2024 campaign continues to plumb new depths with ugly sexist memes and doctored or misrepresented video clips having a free run on untethered social media. While Trump supporters have circulated images purporting to show Harris having loose morals, her supporters in turn have plied clips showing Trump as a degenerate. On Friday, liberal trolls shared a clip of Trump expressing frustration over a faulty mike at a rally in Milwaukee, alleging he was simulating a fellatio.Trump also flew into a rage after he was taunted by a former billionaire fanboy, Mark Cuban, who told a TV show that the MAGA supremo is intimidated by strong, intelligent women. He unloaded on Cuban, calling him a ""dumb guy"" ""weak"" ""insecure"" ""a major loser"" ""unattractive"" etc., in an extraordinarily tetchy social media rant.The Trump campaign later released testimonials from several women, including his former senior counselor Kellyanne Conway and Arkansas Governor, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, his former spokesperson, sharing why women support Trump and how he has empowered them. “He (Cuban) is very wrong, I surround myself with the strongest of women — With the understanding that ALL women are great, whether strong or not strong,” Trump wrote. There was no word from his wife Melania Trump or his daughter Ivanka, who have both been very scarce on the campaign trail.","Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes has opened an investigation into comments by MAGA supremo Donald Trump.

Iron Beam: Israel's 'new era of warfare' defence system to use high-power lasers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/iron-beam-israels-new-era-of-warfare-defence-system-to-use-high-power-lasers/articleshow/114870623.cms,"How does 'Iron Beam' work?

Israel's advanced "" Iron Beam "" laser defense system is anticipated to be operational in the next year strengthening its defense system, reports CNN citing Israel’s defense ministry. Israel invested over $500 million this week in contracts with domestic defense companies Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and Elbit Systems to enhance the shield's production.The Iron Beam, developed alongside the Iron Dome, is designed to neutralize various aerial threats including missiles, drones, rockets, and mortars, according to Israel's defense ministry.Israeli officials have claimed that the development will bring a ""a new era of warfare"" as the nation confronts drone and missile threats from Iran and its allies.""It heralds the beginning of a new era in warfare. The initial capability of the ground-based laser system… is expected to enter operational service within one year,"" said Eyal Zamir, director general of the defense ministry, in a recent announcement.The system's prototype was first shown in 2021, and development has continued steadily since then.These developments occur as Israel maintains military operations in Gaza and Lebanon, following recent direct missile exchanges with Iran.Military analysts indicate that the Iron Beam could strengthen Israel's defensive capabilities while potentially reducing operational costs.A ground-based high-power laser system operates by targeting and heating vulnerable components of projectiles, such as engines or warheads, from distances ranging from hundreds of meters to several kilometers until they fail.This approach differs with Israel's current missile defense strategy, which relies on radar detection followed by launching interceptor missiles to neutralize incoming threats in the air.Defense experts indicate that a laser-based defense system would provide superior performance to the Iron Dome while being more cost-effective and responsive.According to Yehoshua Kalisky from the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, each Iron Dome interception requires two missiles, with individual missiles costing approximately $50,000 or more.The ongoing conflict with Israel's northern neighbor has necessitated frequent interceptions. The IDF reported that on Tuesday alone, approximately 50 projectiles entered Israeli territory from southern Lebanon, with only partial interception success.The company developing Iron Beam, Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, said that laser interceptions have ""almost zero cost per interception.""Experts indicate that the laser system would particularly excel at countering drones, which have proven challenging for the Iron Dome to intercept.While the Iron Dome effectively counters rockets and missiles, it struggles with drones due to their small size, light weight, and minimal radar signature. Unlike missiles, drones can alter their flight paths and are harder for radar systems to detect.However, weather conditions pose significant limitations for the Iron Beam, as clouds, rain, and haze reduce its atmospheric penetration and target acquisition capabilities. The system also requires substantial power resources for operation.Various nations have developed different laser defense systems. The US Navy has tested high-powered lasers capable of destroying aircraft, while the UK has introduced DragonFire for aerial defense. According to the Pentagon, both China and Russia are working on satellite-targeting laser technology.Iran's status regarding indigenous laser defense systems remains uncertain. In 2022, Iranian state media reported the country's claimed ability to ""manufacture laser weapons to defend sensitive regions.""Reports suggest Iran may possess the Chinese-manufactured ""Silent Hunter"" laser weapon, though experts indicate it's less powerful than the planned Iron Beam system.","Israel's advanced "" Iron Beam "" laser defense system is anticipated to be operational in the next year strengthening its defense system.

Despite the projected confidence, former president Donald Trump is anxious as Election Day is approaching and reports said he is asking more questions to his aides about his status; he's also demanding more work from his aides.

On Thursday Trump received an internal memo from chief pollster for all his three presidential campaigns Tony Fabrizio that Trump is in a better position to win this election than he was at this time in 2020.Trump's calls to his aides come late at night and early morning. He asks them their opinion on whether they think he will win. A CNN report revealed that Trump asked his close allies why women don't like him. The former president ""thinks women want someone who will keep them safe, keep their children safe,"" CNN reported citing sources.Axios reported that gender parity in early voting is also a cause of concern for the Trump campaign. It is believed that men are voting for Trump and women for Kamala Harris. Early voters have mostly been women. ""This is a concern and we encourage men to vote early if they can and on Election Day if they can't,"" Gavin Wax, president of the New York Young Republican Club told Axios over text. ""... Men need to swamp the polls on Election Day and prior"" to help Trump win.National polls indicate Kamala Harris is winning more women than Trump.

ATLANTA: Kamala Harris on Saturday criticized House Speaker Mike Johnson for suggesting that Republicans might cut government subsidies for semiconductor manufacturing as she and Republican Donald Trump embarked on one last weekend quest to round up every possible vote in the battleground states that will determine the next president.""It is my plan and intention to continue to invest in American manufacturing,"" the Democratic nominee told reporters in Milwaukee, adding that Trump had lost manufacturing jobs during his presidency.Harris spoke before heading to campaign rallies in Atlanta and Charlotte, North Carolina. Trump was attending two rallies in North Carolina and one in Salem, Virginia, a state that isn't a battleground, after his late-night rally in Milwaukee.""We stand on the verge of the four greatest years in American history,"" Trump said in remarks released by his campaign before his first event, in Gastonia, North Carolina.President Joe Biden, who dropped out of the race this summer when it became clear he could not win, was doing his part for the Democrats, making one last 2024 campaign stop in Scranton, Pennsylvania.Harris' campaign released her closing ad pitch to the American people, a two-minute spot set to air Sunday during NFL games broadcast by CBS and FOX, including the Green Bay Packers against the Detroit Lions. The ad shows some of Harris' interactions with people during the campaign and has her looking directly into the camera and addressing voters.""Now I'm asking for your vote because as president I will get up every day and fight for the American people,"" she says at the end.Campaign manager Jen O'Mallely Dillon projected confidence on a conference call with reporters Saturday as both sides entered in the final sprint to get out the vote. ""If you can hear the joy in my voice it is because we are in GOTV weekend,"" she said.Johnson, R-La., later walked back his comments about cutting semiconductor subsidies, indicating he only meant that Republicans would ""streamline"" the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act. But Harris said Johnson had only issued the follow-up statement because ""their agenda is not popular.""The legislation has pumped billions of dollars into producing computer chips in the United States, supporting union jobs in battleground states such as Michigan.The vice presidential nominees and big name supporters also were out in force.Harris' running mate, Tim Walz, and actress Eva Longoria were joining a get-out-the-vote event in Las Vegas before the Minnesota governor flies to Arizona for events in Flagstaff and Tucson. GOP vice presidential nominee JD Vance was scheduled to be in Las Vegas and Scottsdale, Arizona, for events with Donald Trump Jr. First lady Jill Biden was campaigning in Georgia and Hillary Clinton was appearing in Tampa, Florida, to back Harris' candidacy.The Trump and Harris planes parked near each other overnight at the Milwaukee airport and the candidates spent the night at hotels just three blocks apart. Before Harris had even left Milwaukee, supporters were lined up for her rally in Atlanta.Marzella and Darrell Pittman, who found out about the Atlanta rally on Friday, canceled their weekend plans and drove four hours from Alabama to attend.Marzella thinks Harris will win, but Darrell is nervous because many of the young Black men in his life support Trump and are hesitatant to vote for a woman for president.""It's tight, and the other side, they got a lot of our people believing in that side, just like we believe in Kamala,"" he said.Until the election, ""we have nothing but voting on our mind and we're talking to everybody,"" Marzella Pittman said.There is ""so much on the line"" and ""no way we can let this slip away,"" Darrell Pittman said.Carol Hicks, who drives around with a stack of Harris signs in her back seat, she said was optimistic because she has ""die-hard Republican coworkers"" who voted for Harris because they could not stomach voting for Trump.

As the United States nears the 2024 presidential election, candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are intensifying their campaigns in key battleground states, where outcomes remain uncertain, particularly in crucial swing states .The presidential election is scheduled for Tuesday, November 5, 2024.Federal elections take place on the first Tuesday of November, a date set in the early 19th century. Originally, states held elections on various days, but in 1845, a law was passed to unify the election day nationwide.Early November was chosen as it suited the predominantly agricultural society of the time—falling after the harvest yet with mild enough weather for travel.Catch comprehensive live coverage of the election results on TimesofIndia.com. You can stream the results on TOI’s YouTube channel and follow real-time updates on our website.Voting locations will commence operations between 7:00 am and 9:00 am local time across different states, which corresponds to 4:30 pm through 9:30 pm Indian Standard Time (IST), accounting for various US time zones, ALJAZEERA reported.Voting centres will conclude operations at different times, varying by state and county jurisdictions. The majority will finish between 6pm Eastern Time and midnight Eastern Time.Initial results should emerge shortly after the first polls close at 6pm Eastern Time (22:00 GMT). Later in November: It could take days for the election result to be known, especially if it is closed and mail-in ballots are a factor.If the contest between Harris and Trump proves close, the counting process could extend beyond election night, potentially requiring several days to determine the winner.New York Times :fivethirtyeight:Seven crucial swing states will likely determine the presidential outcome, comprising Pennsylvania (19 Electoral votes ), North Carolina (16), Georgia (16), Michigan (15), Arizona (11), Wisconsin (10), and Nevada (6), totalling 93 Electoral College votes.A successful candidate requires 270 of the available 538 Electoral votes.According to Newsmax political analyst Mark Halperin, Harris faces challenges in Georgia, North Carolina and Arizona. Halperin suggests Harris might secure Pennsylvania but could still lose the White House, particularly if Wisconsin proves unfavourable. Her position mirrors Joe Biden's situation before the debate.According to CNN reports, indeed, while improbable, it remains a possibility. One possible scenario for the 2024 election shows: If Harris secures Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona, Nevada and one electoral vote from Nebraska - states previously won by Joe Biden in 2020 - but loses Pennsylvania and Georgia, the result would be a 269-269 deadlock. Additional tied-election scenarios are available on the 270 to Win website.In case of a 269-269 tie, or if a third-party or independent candidate secures electoral votes preventing any candidate from achieving the required 270 Electoral College majority, the situation proceeds to a ""contingent election"".During a contingent election, the US House of Representatives determines the winner. Each state's House delegation receives one vote, and victory requires a majority of state delegation votes.The 12th Amendment, established following the contentious 1800 election, stipulates that if no candidate achieves an Electoral College majority, the newly inaugurated Congress (sworn in on January 3) selects the president, whilst the Senate chooses the vice president.Indian-American Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi weighed in on the major influence that Indian Americans can have in the upcoming US presidential elections . He said that their votes might determine the election results both in key states and nationwide.He told ANI, ""The community is looking for practical problem-solving leaders, people who put ideology aside and are principled about making sure that everyone can enjoy the American dream as long as they work hard, play by the rules and try to help their country.""","The presidential election is scheduled for Tuesday, November 5, 2024.

For the latest updates, check out our comprehensive guide on the US Election:

As Americans prepare to head to the polls on November 5, the 2024 presidential race between Democratic nominee Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump has reached a fever pitch. Both candidates are locked in a tense battle for the White House, with opinion polls showing a tight race in the seven crucial swing states likely to decide the outcome. With over 72 million Americans casting early votes, the stage is set for one of the most dramatic election results in modern US history. Yet, the final outcome may not be known for days, sparking anticipation and uncertainty across the nation.On Election Day, voting will close at different times depending on the state, and the counting of votes will commence immediately. Typically, major news networks and agencies like the Associated Press rely on their data models to “call” each state’s result soon after polls close. However, with millions of early and mail-in ballots, many of which will need additional time to process, the full picture may not emerge on election night. If either candidate wins the pivotal 270 Electoral College votes on November 5 or shortly thereafter, the winner might be projected, but this year’s election is expected to stretch into the following days.Seven battleground states—Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin, and North Carolina—will play a decisive role in the race’s outcome. These states carry considerable weight in the Electoral College and were narrowly split in the 2020 election. For Trump, regaining these states is essential, while Harris aims to hold onto these Democratic strongholds to secure her place in the White House. States like Florida and Ohio, which have trended Republican in recent elections, may also influence the final result, but the swing states are where both campaigns have concentrated their final efforts.Unlike traditional voting methods, processing mail-in ballots and early votes can extend counting by several days. Each state has different rules on when and how to process these ballots, and closely contested states are likely to witness a more prolonged counting period. In 2020, for instance, the result took four days to be called, as Pennsylvania’s vote tally played a decisive role. Given the expected high turnout and close race, election experts caution that this year may similarly require patience.Adding to the complexity, Trump has already questioned the integrity of the election process, particularly in swing states, casting doubts on mail-in ballots and early votes. He has suggested he may contest the results if they do not favour him, which could lead to further delays or legal disputes in the aftermath of the election.Once individual states have certified their results—typically by mid-to-late November or early December—the Electoral College will formally cast its votes, with Congress scheduled to declare the final outcome on January 6, 2025. However, public perception of the winner often comes earlier, once the 270-vote threshold is reached.","The 2024 presidential race between Democratic nominee Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump has reached a fever pitch.

ISLAMABAD: In a pivotal legislative move, the Pakistani government introduced a bill on Friday that seeks to authorise military and civil armed forces to detain individuals charged with terrorism for up to three months under a system of "" preventive detention .""This bill, which amends the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) of 1997, was tabled by law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar in a session of the National Assembly that saw limited attendance and was quickly referred to the relevant committee for further consideration, Dawn reported.The proposed legislation includes measures for forming Joint Investigation Teams (JITs) made up of various law enforcement and intelligence agency members to conduct inquiries into terrorism-related cases.These amendments to Clause 11EEEE of the ATA were initially enacted following the tragic Army Public School attack in Peshawar but lapsed a decade ago due to a sunset clause.As outlined in the bill's Statement of Objects and Reasons, the ""erstwhile amendments of Section 11EEEE of the Act are required to be re-inserted to empower the government, armed forces and civil armed forces with the necessary authority to detain individuals who pose a significant threat to national security.""The new provisions would allow preventive detention based on credible information or reasonable suspicion, enabling authorities to intervene before potential terrorist acts can be carried out, reported Dawn.Furthermore, the bill aims to strengthen the legal framework for law enforcement agencies to conduct more effective operations against terrorism. It will facilitate the formation of JITs to conduct thorough inquiries and gather actionable intelligence.According to the bill, Section 11EEEE was amended in 2014 to allow the government and authorised military and civil forces to detain individuals suspected of terrorism-related activities, but its validity expired in 2016 due to a sunset clause.The proposed amendment states: ""The government or, where the provisions of Section 4 have been invoked, the armed forces or civil armed forces, as the case may be, subject to the specific or general order of the government in this regard, for a period not exceeding three months and after recording reasons thereof, issue order for the preventive detention of any person who has been concerned in any offence under this Act relating to the security or defence of Pakistan or any part thereof, or public order relating to target killing, kidnapping for ransom, and extortion, bhatta or the maintenance of supplies or services, or against whom a reasonable complaint has been made or credible information has been received, or a reasonable suspicion exists of his having been so concerned, for purpose of inquiry.""Additionally, the amendment specifies that the detention of such persons, including any extensions beyond three months, will adhere to Article 10 of the Constitution. A new provision mandates that if an armed forces-issued detention order is made, the inquiry will involve a JIT, including a police officer of at least superintendent rank and members from various intelligence agencies.These new provisions will remain valid for two years following the commencement of the ATA (Amendment) Act, 2024.In related parliamentary discussions, speaker Ayaz Sadiq warned he would summon meetings of seven standing committees to elect chairpersons if the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party does not provide nominations by next week. The issue was raised after criticism of government ministers' absence during a question hour, Dawn reported.Law minister Tarar also addressed concerns regarding the placement of several opposition lawmakers on the Exit Control List (ECL), indicating that names are added due to absconding in criminal cases. He encouraged opposition members to formally submit requests for review, stating that 65 to 70 per cent of ECL removal requests are typically accepted.The National Assembly is scheduled to reconvene on Monday evening.","Pakistani government introduces bill to authorise military and civil armed forces to detain individuals charged with terrorism for up to three months.

ISLAMABAD: At least seven people, including five schoolchildren and a police constable, were killed and more than 20 others injured in a roadside bomb explosion in Mastung district of Pakistan ’s southwestern Balochistan province on Friday.State-run PTV news quoted Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif as saying that the explosion had occurred at a “girls’ high school”, while another post by the outlet said the incident occurred “near girls’ high school chowk”.Naeem Bazai, commissioner for Kalat division, said the attack had occurred near Mastung’s civil hospital, a few metres from the girls’ school.Officials said the blast resulted from an improvised explosive device (IED) fitted inside a motorcycle parked outside a mechanic’s shop. “The IED exploded when a police mobile and a school van were crossing the blast site,” said Mastung district deputy commissioner Baz Muhammad Marri.“Seven people, including a cop and five minor children, were killed and 22 others injured in the explosion,” Marri told the media. “We are ascertaining who was actually targeted because a police mobile and a school van were both passing by the area,” he added.Sarfaraz Bugti, Balochistan’s chief minister, condemned the attack and expressed grief over the loss of lives. “The terrorists have targeted innocent children. We will hold accountable, the perpetrators of the blast,” he said in a statement.Waseem Baig, a spokesman for the Balochistan health department, said 11 injured, including two children, had been shifted to a trauma centre in Quetta, the provincial capital. “Three injured are in critical condition,” he added.Balochistan, Pakistan’s largest province by area, has been facing grave security conditions since the country launched a military offensive there in 2006, vowing to wipe out so-called traitors and terrorists.At least 20 labourers were killed in a rocket attack in October on coal mines in the province’s Duki district. The incident had prompted more than 40,000 other labourers to return to their native areas in Punjab and Sindh. Several workers were killed in Sept when armed men stormed an under-construction house in Panjgur. All slain labourers hailed from Multan, Punjab province.The volatile situation in Balochistan has also been a major challenge for Beijing to complete projects linked to the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative.

Your country is the only exception,"" Dar said, quoting Chinese authorities as telling their Pakistani counterparts at recent meetings.He was speaking at a seminar this week organised by the Pakistan-China Institute, an independent Islamabad-based think tank.Chinese envoy Jiang Zaidong, who was at the event, stood up to contradict Dar. ""The security of Chinese citizens is paramount for President Xi (Jinping),"" he said, adding that Beijing iterated its priorities during Xi's discussions with the Pakistan govt during his recent visit to the country.He warned that violence targeting Chinese nationals was causing a rethink on Beijing's investments under its Belt and Road Initiative(BRI). The diplomat stressed the need for Islamabad to take effective remedial measures to prevent the recurrence of such acts of terror acts.In an official response Thursday, Pakistan's foreign office spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch termed the Chinese ambassador's statement ""perplexing"" and a stark departure from longstanding diplomatic norms governing bilateral ties.The Chinese officials seldom chastise Islamabad for alleged security failings involving Chinese engineers and workers, and Pakistan’s public response to China’s criticism is also unprecedented. However, Beijing’s security concerns have been heightened by the recent increase in violence against Chinese people.Earlier this month, two Chinese citizens were killed and 10 others wounded in a suicide attack near Karachi airport for which the outlawed Balochistan Liberation Army later owned responsibility.In March, five Chinese engineers died in a suicide bombing in the Besham region of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Twenty-one Chinese workers have been killed in Pakistan since the countries launched the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor project a decade ago.","China finds it ""unacceptable"" that its citizens have been targeted by terrorists in Pakistan twice in six months.

Severe flooding in Pakistan's Sindh province has left thousands of people suffering: Rights group,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/severe-flooding-in-pakistans-sindh-province-has-left-thousands-of-people-suffering-rights-group/articleshow/114851746.cms,"(ANI photo)

SINDH: Amnesty International has condemned the suffering of thousands of Sindhis who are affected due to severe flooding and a surge in water-borne diseases in the backdrop of the Pakistan government's inaction, according to the rights group statement.Following major flooding in August 2024, more than 140,000 people were displaced with many now living in tents. Months later, affected communities are still struggling with health risks and lost livelihoods compounded by little international or government support.With disease rampant due to stagnant floodwaters, older people, children and pregnant women are at increased risk of illness and death.Amnesty said that the Sindh government has failed to guarantee essential services such as healthcare, food, and housing. This has led to the violation of economic, social, and cultural rights as outlined by the international human rights ratified by Pakistan, the statement said.Scott Edwards, Crisis Response Programme Director at Amnesty International, stated, ""Tens of thousands of people have been abandoned by the Sindh government and the international community after being devastated again by major floods. Many impacted communities were harmed by record-breaking floods in 2022 and have struggled to rebuild their lives.""Edwards emphasized the urgency of addressing climate changeand its humanitarian impacts, calling for immediate action from both the international community and Pakistauthorities. ""Climate change is not a tentative threat; lives are being lost today to global inaction and inadequate humanitarian response,"" he said.Shazia Chandio lost her son during the floods, she told Amnesty International, for one day and one night he was suffering diarrhoea, and then the next day he died."" She further expressed her sorrow and said, ""Nobody has helped. Those who have money here move to a safer place, but those who don't have money stay.""In September 2024, Amnesty International visited eight flood-affected villages in the Badin and Dadu districts of Sindh. They interviewed 36 residents including groups such as older adults, people with disabilities, and children. The organisation urged people to support the people who suffered due to flooding.","Amnesty International has condemned the suffering of thousands of Sindhis who are affected due to severe flooding.

In the shootout, three attackers were also killed.An attack occurred on Tuesday in Orakzai, a district in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where health workers were preparing for a polio vaccination campaign. Local police officer Adnan Khan reported that no polio workers were harmed, but a police officer was injured.The attack targeted health workers and police who were gathering for a door-to-door vaccination drive. Adnan Khan stated, ""The attack happened in the morning hours as health workers were gathering ahead of leaving for the door-to-door campaign along with police, who escort polio teams for their safety.""In a separate incident on the same day, militants attacked a health center in North Waziristan. They seized guns from officers and warned health workers not to participate in the polio campaign.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan began a nationwide vaccination campaign Monday to protect 45 million children from polio after a surge in new cases that has hampered years of efforts to stop the disease in one of the two countries where it has never been eradicated.Pakistan regularly launches such campaigns, but violence targeting the health workers and police assigned to escort them is common. Militants falsely claim the vaccination campaigns are a Western conspiracy to sterilize children.The campaign is the third this year and will continue until Sunday ""in response to the alarming increase in polio cases,"" said Ayesha Raza Farooq , the prime minister's adviser for the polio eradication program. ""We are re-energized in our efforts to combat polio,"" she said in a statement.During the door-to-door campaign, children younger than 5 will be vaccinated and given drops of Vitamin A supplements to enhance their immunity.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif recently met with front-line health workers, urging them to ensure no child was left unvaccinated by going door-to-door.Anwarul Haq, who is the coordinator of the National Emergency Operations Centre for Polio Eradication, also urged parents to fully cooperate with polio workers. ""Polio has no cure, but it can be prevented with this readily available vaccine,"" he said.Pakistan has recorded 41 cases across 71 districts so far this year, Farooq said. Most were reported from southwestern Balochistan and southern Sindh province, following by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and eastern Punjab province.The surge in cases in new locations is worrying authorities since previous cases were from the restive northwest bordering Afghanistan, where the Taliban government in September suddenly stopped a door-to-door vaccination campaign.Authorities in Pakistan say the Afghan Taliban's recent decision to stop door-to-door anti-polio campaign will have repercussions beyond the Afghan border, as people from both sides frequently travel to each other's country. The World Health Organization has confirmed 18 polio cases in Afghanistan this year.Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only two countries in the world where the spread of polio has never been stopped. It is one of the world's most infectious diseases, so it continues to spread anywhere people are not fully vaccinated. In severe cases, polio can cause permanent paralysis and death.","Pakistan has recorded 41 cases across 71 districts so far this year.
