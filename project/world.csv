Acknowledging that the location of the station - in the middle of two rural rail stations and at least a kilometre's trek along tea plantations and agricultural fields from Phansidewa Road - was a constraint, they said they had reached the spot as early as they could. The locals of Nirmal Jote, where the incident occurred, insisted the rescue team arrived late and pointed out that many of the injured were taken to hospitals in e-rickshaws, as ambulances had arrived much later.Md Hasim, one of the locals who had rushed to the spot along with his friends, said they used chisels and hammers to pry open doors and evacuate passengers stuck inside. Also, because it had been raining, most coach windows were shut. ""We used kitchen utensils like tongs to open the windows and take out the wounded,"" he said.""I cut my hand while rescuing a passenger who was stuck. There were no ambulances. Local youths hired private vehicles and sent the injured to North Bengal Medical College and Hospital,"" said Md Rahul.An NDRF officer said they were alerted about the accident at 10.05am. The first of the three teams reached the spot by 10.40am, he added. ""There were three bodies - that of the loco pilot and co-pilot of the goods carriage and that of the guard of Kanchenjunga Express - that were caught in a mangled mess. Our men managed to retrieve them. The entire rescue operation was complete by 2pm. While two of our teams are on standby at the spot, one has left,"" the officer said.The officer added that 82 NDRF personnel were engaged in the rescue operation. Two officers flew down from Kolkata.

"China boosting nuclear arsenal, has 3x India's warheads: SIPRI",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/china-boosting-nuclear-arsenal-has-3x-indias-warheads-sipri/articleshow/111067300.cms,"NEW DELHI: China is boosting its nuclear arsenal faster than any other country around the globe, and now has triple the number of warheads that India has, while it also deploys some of them on ""high operational alert"" on ballistic missiles.Pakistan, in turn, maintains its rough parity with India in the number of nuclear warheads, while Russia and the US are leagues ahead of others, together accounting for 90% of all nuclear weapons .China now has 500 warheads, up from 410 in January 2023, while India has 172 (from 164 in 2023) and Pakistan 170 (unchanged from 2023), as per the latest assessment by the Stockholm International Peace Institute (SIPRI) released on Monday.The Indian defence establishment, however, remains confident of its strategic deterrence capability, which is poised to get some additional teeth after the already-inducted over 5,000-km range Agni-5 ballistic missile was tested for the first time with multiple-warhead capability on March 11 this year.Moreover, India is increasingly going in for more canister-launch missiles - with the warhead already mated with the missile - for the requisite operational readiness and flexibility to store it for long periods, swiftly transport it through rail or road, and fire it whenever required.India is also set to strengthen its weakest leg of the nuclear triad by finally commissioning its second SSBN (naval parlance for nuclear-propelled submarines armed with nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles), INS Arighat, within the next few months. The first, INS Arihant, became operational in 2018.SIPRI said the deterrence role of nuclear weapons has grown amid the ongoing geopolitical turmoil over conflicts like the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas ones. All the nine nuclear-armed states continue to modernise their nuclear arsenals, with several deploying new nuclear-armed or nuclear-capable weapon systems in 2023, it said.The nuclear stockpiles stand at: Russia (4,380 warheads), US (3,708), France (290), UK (225), Israel (90) and North Korea (50). An estimated 3,904 of these warheads are deployed with missiles and aircraft, with the rest being kept in storage.""Around 2,100 of the deployed warheads were kept in a state of high operational alert on ballistic missiles. Nearly all of these warheads belonged to Russia or the US, but for the first time China is believed to have some warheads on high operational alert,"" SIPRI said.The Pentagon, in a report last Oct, had said China was fully on course to reach over 1,000 warheads by 2030, while it also builds a formidable arsenal of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). The Swedish think-tank, on its part, said China could potentially have at least as many ICBMs as Russia or the US by the turn of the decade, although its stockpile of nuclear warheads is still expected to remain much smaller than their stockpiles.SIPRI also said India, Pakistan and North Korea are all pursuing the capability to deploy multiple warheads on ballistic missiles, a capability that the US, UK, Russia, France and China already have. ""This would enable a rapid potential increase in deployed warheads, as well as the possibility for nuclear-armed countries to threaten the destruction of significantly more targets,"" it said.","China now has 500 warheads, up from 410 in January 2023, while India has 172. Pakistan, in turn, maintains its rough parity with India in the number of nuclear warheads. Russia and the US are leagues ahead of others, together accounting for 90% of all nuclear weapons.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111067310,imgsize-23134,width-400,resizemode-4/111067310.jpg"
"How engineer-turned-cop checkmated reel hero, jailed top Kannada film star Darshan",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/karnataka-murder-how-engineer-turned-cop-checkmated-reel-hero/articleshow/110982273.cms,"Divya Spandana aka Ramya Lashes Kannada Star Darshan; 'No One Above Law'

Unravelling mystery

Justice for man’s kin priority, not ban: Sudeep

BENGALURU: When Sandalwood star Darshan was arrested , the million-dollar question asked in Karnataka 's political and police circles along with the public was who was instrumental in putting one of the biggest stars of Kannada film industry with a crazy fan base behind bars.As TOI started piecing together the murder puzzle involving 17 accused, including Darshan's girlfriend Pavithra Gowda , the role of one police officer stood out: deputy commissioner of police (west division) S Girish.""If not for this dynamic officer, the truth in the case would have got buried. Daring to pick a leading and influential film star on charges of murder requires courage,"" said a senior IPS officer, while commending Girish, assistant commissioner of police (Vijayanagar) Chandan Kumar, and also police commissioner B Dayananda who backed them. In fact, both Girish and Chandan have become 'real heroes' for many young cops on the verge of getting disillusioned by the system where dedication to do good barely fetches any brownie points.""Look at the sequence of events here: there was a murdered person and four guys who walked into station owning up the crime. The station-level officers believed the cooked-up story and chose to close the case. But Girish wasn't convinced,"" said sources. Usually, surrenders in murder cases happen in rowdy-related killings for security reasons. But the four who surrendered lacked consistency in their statements and, the victim was not an anti-social element. Girish, joined by Chandan , started grilling the four and learnt that the latter are just fall guys and are not connected to Renukaswamy. They were offered money to go to jail. Girish's next question was: ""Who offered money?"". The fall guys pointed to Vinay V, owner of a restaurant in RR Nagar, and police wasted no time in securing him. During questioning, Girish and Chandan learnt one of the accused had called a sub inspector in Kamakshipalya and inquired about the surrender process.Vinay, who is a close aide of Darshan, reportedly narrated how things went horribly wrong after Renukaswamy was picked up at the actor's behest and tortured in a godown in RR Nagar. He explained how Darshan was miffed with Renukaswamy's social media comments on his girlfriend Pavithra Gowda and mentioned the names of all those who were part of the torture squad. Police also retrieved CCTV footage of a Jeep Wrangler (which was used by Darshan) moving around along with a Scorpio near the place where the body was dumped.""Next, it was showtime as the 'Sultan of Sandalwood' had to be picked up. We thought it was not going to happen given the stardom and his proximity to politicians. But Girish sir proved us wrong,"" said a cop. While the aides were secured when they were returning from Mysuru, a discreet operation was launched to get Darshan, whose Sandalwood title is 'Challenging Star'.A team led by ACP Chandan Kumar landed at a star hotel in Mysuru where Darshan was staying in the wee hours of Tuesday. When Chandan walked up to the star in the hotel gym and told him to accompany the team, Darshan reportedly said: ""I know..everything got messed up. You carry on, I will come in my car.""Darshan's Rs 3-crore Land Rover Defender was parked at the hotel entrance. However, Chandan retorted: ""Will you come with us now or should you be....?"" Darshan, who had mouthed similar dialogues in his cop-themed movies earlier, realised the seriousness and got into the police jeep. He was brought to Bengaluru. Soon, the phone lines of Girish and the commissioner started buzzing. All moves to let the star walk free were checkmated as the TV channels started screaming about the arrest.""Both the actor and his well-wishers did not expect police to act at lightning speed, else the game would have changed,"" a cop claimed.Girish and Chandan were unavailable for comments.Amid the demand to ban Sandalwood star Darshan over his arrest in the Renukaswamy murder case, his colleague Kichcha Sudeep said, “Ban is secondary. The focus should be on providing justice to the person in pain.”Speaking to reporters Sunday, Sudeep lauded the police and media for bringing out the facts. “The film chamber is there to provide justice to those in the in dustry. The right word is not ban, but justice. The focus should first be on providing justice to the aggrieved family,” he said.Refusing to take a stand for or against Darshan, he said,“ As an artist, it is wrong to speak for or against someone. What is needed is justice for the family — the woman, the unborn child, Renukaswamy. People should have their faith restored in justice.”“Everyone’s heart goes out to the family. The whole atmosphere doesn’t seem right; the cinema industry needs justice. Everything wrong gets attributed to the industry. It needs a clean chit. After justice is delivered in court and the guilty are pinned, the industry will get a clean chit,” he said, adding: “Celebrities are not gods. Don’t treat them like that. Don’t put that sort of pressure.”",Deputy commissioner of police (west division) S Girish played key role in Darshan's arrest. Girish questioned four men who claimed to be involved in the murder of Renukaswamy. The four men said they were just fall guys and were offered money to go to jail. Darsha's girlfriend Pavithra Gowda was also arrested.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110987727,imgsize-1629307,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/110987727.jpg"

You should say, 'Joe jobs',"" Joe Biden said something like this in the viral clip from the Hollywood fundraiser.Each day a new gaffe from Joe Biden has become the new normal, thanks to the rising tempers in the US with only 10 days left for the fist public debate between Joe Biden and Republican presumptive presidential candidate Donald Trump.Joe Biden was seen wandering off at the G7 summit in Italy during a parachute exhibition. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni had to guide him back for the group photo with other leaders. During a Juneteenth concert at the White House, Joe Biden appeared disoriented, standing at a distance. Then came the video if Biden freezing at a campaign fundraiser in Los Angeles where he had to be guided off stage by Barack Obama.All this pushed Joe Biden's age (81 years) to the centrestage and the question whether he is fit to be the president for another term. ""So embarassing. The Democrats can't let this go on, surely?"" broasdcaster Piers Morgan posted on X and then elaborated in an article on New York Post that President Biden is no longer fit for the highest office in America.""I don't mean that he's too incompetent for the job, although many would say he is. No, I mean that he's too physically and mentally unfit to function at the extremely high level required to be leader of not just the United States, but also the free world,"" Piers Morgan wrote.""When the last Democrat to occupy the White House has to literally grab the current one because he notices he’s had yet another “senior moment” and appears to be paralyzed like a statue on stage, it has to be the wake-up call everyone in the party must urgently heed before it’s too late, doesn’t it?We’re only five months away from the 2024 general election, but what is now painfully obvious is that Joe Biden’s already cooked as a candidate,"" he wrote.","A video of US President Joe Biden speaking about employment and jobs has gone viral. Biden first said US has the highest unemployment in 50 years and then promptly corrected it with 'lowest' ""So embarassing. The Democrats can't let this go on, surely?""

Crisis 2.0 for SAD: Chandumajra says no statement on ‘full faith’ in Sukhbir,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/crisis-2-0-for-sad-chandumajra-says-no-statement-on-full-faith-in-sukhbir/articleshow/111065368.cms,"Under fire

CHANDIGARH: Shiromani Akali Dal ( SAD ) senior leader and former MP Prem Singh Chadumajra has raised serious questions on his own party’s press statement in which it was mentioned that party leaders placed “full faith and confidence” in party president Sukhbir Singh Badal ’s leadership.The SAD statement was issued on Friday, after a six-hour-long meeting of the party’s core committee . “Despite making it clear in the meeting by senior party leaders that no such resolution will be passed, if still the party issues such a statement to the press, it is betrayal with party leaders,” said Chandumajra .He said many party leaders were shocked to read the next day’s newspapers. He said it was decided by members in the presence of Sukhbir that this meeting will be an informal one and for having an indepth discussion on the par ty’s continuous debacles. Thereafter, individual and group meetings will be held to pinpoint main causes and the way out to prepare a draft to be laid in the next core committee meeting, he added.“When Bains sahab (Harcharan Bains, principal advisor to SAD president) asked Sukhbir ji regarding the resolution about full faith in the party president, Sukhbir ji himself said there is no need to write such a thing in the press statement,” said the Akali Dal leader.The former MP added he also intervened and said such amessage had not been conveyed by the core committee members and even other leaders — Balwinder Singh Bhunder, Gurpartap Singh Wadala, Bibi Jagir Kaur and Surjit Singh Rakhra — also said the same thing.When contacted, SAD spokesperson Daljit Singh Cheema Cheema told TOI, “It is a clerical mistake. Neither there was any requirement for the resolution nor was it passed by the core committee.”He added core committee members had clarified in the meeting that it was an introspection meeting and there was no need for passing any resolution. Another senior SAD leader and core committee member, who did not wish to be named, said such incidents are evidence why Akali Dal, which used to be the saviour of the Panth, had gone into a cri sis. “Doesn’t this reflect how sycophants are still calling the shots for the comfort of the sinking ship’s captain? Rather than saving the party, we are more interested in saving the president’s chair,” he added.The official statement issued by the SAD after the sixhour-long core committee meeting on Friday reads, “The meeting placed on record its wholehearted appreciation of the spirited, selfless and resolute leadership provided by the party president, Sardar Sukhbir Singh Badal especially during the past six months leading up to the polling date. The manner in which the SAD president took brave and selfless decisions, making unheard of personal sacrifices for the party’s interests, is a matter of pride for the entire party. The party places full faith and confidence in his leadership and salutes his single-minded devotion to the party’s interests.”","SAD statement was issued on Friday, after a six-hour-long meeting of the party’s core committee. “Despite making it clear in the meeting by senior party leaders that no such resolution will be passed, if still the party issues such a statement to the press, it is betrayal with party leaders,” said Chandumajra.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111065456,imgsize-59174,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/111065456.jpg"

Taiwan keeping watch after Chinese submarine surfaces in Taiwan Strait,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/taiwan-keeping-watch-after-chinese-submarine-surfaces-in-taiwan-strait/articleshow/111071978.cms,"TAIPEI: Taiwan's defence minister said on Tuesday that they have a ""grasp"" of the situation after pictures appeared online of a Chinese nuclear submarine surfacing in the sensitive Taiwan Strait near Taiwanese fishermen.The narrow strait that separates Taiwan from China is a frequent source of tension. Taiwan reports Chinese warplanes and warships operating there on a daily basis, as Beijing seeks to assert its sovereignty claims against the democratically governed island.Taiwanese media published the pictures of the surfaced craft, which appears to be a nuclear-armed Jin class ballistic missile submarine, taken by a Taiwanese fishing boat in the strait as dawn broke on Tuesday, about 200 km (125 miles) from Taiwan's western coast.Asked about the submarine, Taiwan defence minister Wellington Koo said they have a ""grasp"" of the intelligence situation, but declined to say how they were monitoring it or give details.China's defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Military experts say the strategic waters off Taiwan's southwestern shores, where the largely shallow Taiwan Strait descends in depth, provide submarines a location for an ambush, making it a hot spot for militaries including China, Taiwan and the United States.Ballistic missile submarines are not designed to attack ships, but to launch ballistic missiles at targets on land.Taiwan's fleet of P-3C Orion anti-submarine aircraft are based at the Pingtung air base in southern Taiwan, giving easy access to the southern part of the strait.Taiwan has complained in recent years that China has been using so-called grey zone warfare designed to exhaust a foe without resorting to open combat, such as flying surveillance balloons over the island.""We must be fully alert to China's continued military harassment and grey zone threats and must always understand China's constant salami-slicing attempts to unilaterally change the status quo,"" Koo said.""We must be alert at all times, but not panic nor be apathetic, and calmly deal with the situation in the strait,"" he added. ""We won't be the one provoking, and call on China not to be a troublemaker.""Taiwan detected 20 Chinese military planes and seven vessels around the island in the past 24 hours, Taiwan's defence ministry said in its daily report on Chinese military activities on Tuesday morning.","Taiwanese media published pictures of the surfaced craft, which appears to be a nuclear-armed Jin class ballistic missile submarine.

South Korean soldiers responded by broadcasting warnings and firing warning shots, prompting the North Korean soldiers to retreat. Following the incident, the South's military did not observe any further suspicious activities.This incident follows a similar incident that occurred on June 11, when South Korean soldiers fired warning shots to deter another group of North Korean soldiers who briefly crossed the MDL. According to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Tuesday's incident took place in a different area along the central frontline region. The South's military believes that the North Korean soldiers did not intentionally intrude across the border, and the North did not return fire.In recent weeks, the South's military has observed an increase in North Korean construction activity along the frontline border areas. These activities include the installation of suspected anti-tank barriers, road reinforcement, and the planting of land mines.The recent border intrusions have taken place amidst rising tensions between the two war-divided nations. In a display of Cold War-style psychological warfare, both sides have made it clear that they are no longer adhering to the landmark military agreement signed in 2018, which aimed to reduce tensions between the two countries.","South Korean forces fired warning shots after North Korean troops breached the heavily guarded military demarcation line close to the border on Tuesday.

A series of confrontations between Chinese and Philippine vessels have occurred in disputed areas.New Chinese coast guard rules took effect on Saturday, June 15, which reinforce a 2021 law granting its coastguard the authority to use deadly force against foreign vessels in contested waters.Under these new rules, China's coastguard is empowered to apprehend suspected trespassers and detain them for up to 60 days without the need for a trial.In a statement, the Beijing's Coast Guard said, ""Philippine replenishment ship ignored many solemn warnings from the Chinese side"".It ""approached the... Chinese vessel in an unprofessional way, resulting in a collision"", the statement said.""The Chinese Coast Guard took control measures against the Philippine ship in accordance with the law,"" it added.Beijing accused the ship of having ""illegally broken into the sea near Ren'ai Reef in China's Nansha Islands"", using the Chinese name for the Spratly Islands.Manila has accused the Chinese coast guard of ""barbaric and inhumane behaviour"" against Philippine vessels, and President Ferdinand Marcos has called the new rules a ""very worrisome"" escalation.China has defended its new coast guard rules, with a foreign ministry spokesman saying last month that they were intended to ""better uphold order at sea"".The Group of Seven bloc criticised what it called ""dangerous"" incursions by China in the South China Sea on Friday.

He emphasized that a consistent supply of weapons to Ukraine is the only way to end the ongoing conflict The upcoming July summit aims to send a strong, enduring message of support for Ukraine, particularly as President Joe Biden faces a challenging reelection campaign against Donald Trump, who has expressed skepticism about Western support for Kyiv.Stoltenberg accused China of exacerbating the conflict by rebuilding Russia's defence industry through significant exports, as reported by US officials. He stated, ""Beijing cannot have it both ways. At some point -- and unless China changes course -- allies need to impose a cost. There should be consequences.""The Nato summit will include not only the 32 alliance members but also four key partners from the Asia-Pacific region: Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea. Stoltenberg highlighted Russian President Vladimir Putin's recent visit to North Korea, which has provided shells to Moscow despite UN sanctions, as further evidence of Russia's reliance on authoritarian leaders.In an effort to ""Trump-proof"" future endeavors, Stoltenberg aims to position Nato at the forefront of coordination on Ukraine and establish a mechanism for long-term military funding. He emphasized, ""The more credible our long-term support, the quicker Moscow will realize it cannot wait us out."" Despite the apparent paradox, Stoltenberg believes that providing more weapons to Ukraine is the path to peace.Stoltenberg also plans to inform Biden about the increasing number of Nato members meeting the 2014 goal of allocating two percent of their GDP to defence spending. He acknowledged that successive US administrations have had a valid point in criticizing European allies for spending too little on defence.However, he noted that the situation is changing, and while not entirely satisfied, Nato is in a significantly different position compared to 2014. ""The good news is that's changing,"" Stoltenberg said.""We're not saying that we are satisfied, but we are in a totally different place now than we were back in 2014.""","Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg called China to face repercussions if it continues to support Russia.

The US government has cited Donald Trump as the reason for not releasing Prince Harry's US visa in a new twist to the ongoing case. The Heritage Foundation sued the Department of Homeland Security to get Prince Harry's visa records released. The US government lawyers argued that there was a court ruling about former president Donald Trump's privacy which made Prince Harry also eligible for the same protection.The think tank sought the details of what visa Prince Harry used to enter the US and whether he received any preferential treatment in his visa application. In his memoir Spare, Prince Harry admitted that he previously took drugs. And in US law anyone who has taken drugs can be deemed as 'inadmissible'.The Heritage Foundation sought to know whether Harry lied on his visa application or whether he was given special treatment by the DHS.The government cited the Trump case to stop making any information regarding Harry's visa public knowledge. John Bardo, a lawyer for the department, said, ""They found that President Trump, from when he was a private citizen, his privacy interests outweighed any public interest that there may be in previous interactions he may have had with the FBI. And I would argue, if President Trump has a privacy interest in that kind of interaction with the government, Prince Harry's privacy interest is even greater.""""Because he was never a governmental official in this country, has never appeared on a ballot in this country.""After Harry wrote in his memoir that he had taken cocaine, mushrooms and marijuana, the Heritage Foundation questioned his immigration status.

The Post Fire, which had consumed nearly 23 square miles (60 square kilometers) and prompted the evacuation of at least 1,200 people from the Hungry Valley recreation area on Saturday, was 8 per cent contained.""That 8 per cent is good because it means we are increasing and bolstering our containment lines,"" said Kenichi Haskett, a Los Angeles County Fire Department section chief. Although firefighters aimed to keep the fire at its current size, Haskett noted that further growth was still possible.The fire started as weather conditions turned hot and windy in an area where grasses, which had grown during a rainy winter, had long since dried out and become highly flammable. By Monday morning, the massive smoke columns that had characterized the fire's initial surge had dissipated.Meanwhile, in Northern California , a wildfire that began on Sunday led to evacuation orders and warnings for a sparsely populated region near Lake Sonoma. The Point Fire, located about 80 miles (130 kilometers) north of San Francisco, had burned nearly 2 square miles (5 square kilometers) and destroyed at least one structure. It was 20 per cent contained as of Monday.Ben Nicholls, division chief of the Cal Fire district covering the Point fire area, reported that fire activity had decreased overnight. ""Forecasted winds are supposed to be less than we experienced yesterday, which should allow the resources assigned for this operational period to build and strengthen the control lines that were put in place yesterday,"" Nicholls said in a video briefing.In the south, Pyramid Lake was closed as a precautionary measure on Father's Day due to the Southern California fire, which had started on Saturday afternoon near I-5 in Gorman, about 60 miles (100 kilometers) northwest of Los Angeles. Two structures within the evacuated recreation area were burned. Residents of Castaic, a town with a population of about 19,000, were warned to prepare for potential evacuation if the fire continued to move farther south. Haskett advised, ""If you're in a warning area, be prepared with a 'go bag,' with overnight clothes and your cellphone, your medicines, your glasses. Have your car fueled up. Be ready to evacuate.""Approximately 75 miles (120 kilometers) to the east, the Hesperia Fire, which had burned nearly 2 square miles (5 square kilometers) in San Bernardino County, was 30 per cent contained after no overnight growth.

NEW DELHI: In a heart-wrenching display of their persistent sorrow and discontent, families affected by enforced disappearances in the Balochistan region of Pakistan decided to abandon customary Eid festivities. Instead, they planned to stage a protest to voice their outrage against state agencies alleged to have perpetrated atrocities against the Baloch people.

Mama Qadir Baloch , a key member of the Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP), declared the protest in a video statement, asserting, ""For the past 15 years, the atrocities committed by the Army and intelligence agencies of Pakistan have led the Baloch to boycott Eid celebrations. While Muslims across the world celebrate this occasion, the Baloch mourn.""

Coinciding with this, families of the missing persons organized a sit-in protest at Shaheed Fida Chowk on Eid day, following a similar demonstration in front of the DC office just days prior. The earlier protest concluded after the district administration provided assurances to the families.

The decision to protest on Eid emphasizes the profound impact of enforced disappearances on the Baloch community, who have been tirelessly seeking justice and answers regarding the fate of their loved ones, allegedly taken by state forces.

IMF ties such loans to tough reform measures.According to Iqbal, if Imran came out of jail, “there would be sit-ins and fights again, which the country cannot afford”. “There is a voice of the people that Imran should remain in jail for five years,” Iqbal said. The minister added that the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder was an “angry man” and it wasn’t known with whom he had a quarrel.The minister also made a subtle jab at the legal system by claiming Imran always relied on the “shoulder of the judiciary” for support during trying times. The allusion appeared to be to some court orders that went in favour of Imran in recent times.Asked about confrontation between the judiciary and the military establishment, Iqbal replied: “Both should think whether this is better for the country.”Iqbal recalled the past when politicians used to fight the military and vice versa. “Now we must cooperate for the benefit of the nation because fighting between institutions has put the country’s sovereignty at stake,” the minister said.","Ahsan Iqbal says Imran Khan will have to be kept behind bars for five years.

Legal age for marriage in Pakistan

The marriage of a 12-year-old girl to a 72-year-old man named Habib Khan was called off after successful intervention by the police in Pakistan's Charsadda town. While the police managed to arrest the groom and the 'Nikah Khwan' (a person who solemnizes the marriage), the girl's father managed to escape.A case has been registered against the girl's father, the 72-year-old man, and the 'Nikkah Khwan' under the Child Marriage Act , according to ARY News. Despite the existence of laws prohibiting child marriage, such incidents continue to occur in various parts of Pakistan.The girl's father, Alam Syed, had reportedly agreed to sell his daughter to the elderly man for PKR 500,000.In recent times, law enforcement agencies have thwarted similar attempts in Rajanpur and Thatta, where young girls were being coerced into marrying older men. In Rajanpur, Punjab, an 11-year-old girl was set to marry a 40-year-old man, while in Thatta, a young girl was forcibly married to a 50-year-old landlord before the police took action and rescued the girl.In another incident on May 6, a 70-year-old man was arrested by the police for marrying a 13-year-old girl in Swat. The girl's father had arranged the marriage, but the police swiftly took the groom and the father into custody. The 'Nikkah Khwan' and the marriage witnesses were also arrested, and the minor girl was sent to a hospital for a medical examination.In Pakistan, the legal age for marriage differs based on gender. While the internationally recognized minimum age for both males and females is 18, the country's laws allow males to marry at 18 but permit females to wed at the younger age of 16.Although Sindh province took a step towards gender equality in 2013 by passing legislation to raise the minimum age of marriage to 18 for both genders, this progressive change has not been adopted and implemented throughout the nation. The disparity in legal marriage age between men and women persists in other parts of the nation.","The marriage of a 12-year-old girl to a 72- year-old man was called off after successful intervention by the police in Pakistan's Charsadda town.

Clash between Pakistan judiciary & military establishment intensifies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/clash-between-pakistan-judiciary-military-establishment-intensifies/articleshow/111007675.cms,"Islamabad: The clash between Pakistan’s superior judiciary and the powerful military establishment has intensified as judges have started questioning the conduct of serving army and Inter-Services Intelligence officers over their blatant interference in judicial matters.Several high court and lower court judges have complained that since May 9, 2023 Pakistan’s powerful authorities (army, ISI) have tried to pressure them using intimidatory tactics such as secret surveillance, and even abduction and torture of their family members, to secure favourable outcomes in political cases related to Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) party and its incarcerated founder, Imran Khan.Addressing an event in the garrison city of Rawalpindi on Friday, Lahore high court chief justice Malik Shahzad Ahmad claimed he has received complaints — many verbally — and letters regarding interference in judicial matters by “institutions” (a reference to the army and ISI).“But I have full faith that this interference of the (military) establishment in the judiciary will come to its end very soon,” he asserted.He said he was saying so not just because it was “part of my faith but also includes my experience”.“To get rid of the (military) establishment’s interference, we have to face it with bravery, courage, and without any fear, and with the belief that this interference, God-willing, will end soon,” the Lahore CJ said. “Temporary worries do come but you have to face them eye to eye and not be a target of any of their blackmailing. Do not be hesitant to make any kind of sacrifice,” he added.Justice Ahmad said Pakistan was currently “going through one of the longest periods of a civil government”, adding that the 2007 lawyers’ movement “closed the doors for martial law forever”.On Wednesday, the Lahore HC had summoned Punjab police chief Usman Anwar and other officials on a complaint from a presiding judge of an anti-terrorism court alleging harassment by intelligence and law enforcement agencies.On June 7, the HC registrar’s office had received a special report on district and sessions judge Muhammad Abbas wherein he had said that on May 25, the first day of his new charge, a message was conveyed to him that some ISI authority wanted to meet him in his chamber.Upon refusing to meet the said authority, Abbas alleged that ever since then he had been encountering various incidents, such as firing outside his court in Punjab’s Sargodha city and questioning of family members, among other things.Earlier, in March, six of the eight Islamabad HC judges had penned a startling letter to Supreme Court judges, regarding attempts by the ISI to pressure them through the abduction and torture of their relatives as well as secret surveillance inside their homes. Following the letter, judges from other HCs also acknowledged interference by spy agencies in judicial functions.It led the apex court to take suo motu notice of the matter, with high courts submitting their responses and recommendations as proceedings continued.","Several high court and lower court judges have complained that since May 9, 2023 Pakistan’s powerful authorities (army, ISI) have tried to pressure them using intimidatory tactics.
