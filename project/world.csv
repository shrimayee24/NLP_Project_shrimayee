Civil aviation minister of state Murlidhar Mohol on Saturday dismissed the foreign media reports about the Air India crash investigation in Ahmedabad that killed 260 people in June 2025, adding that the probe is still ongoing and no final conclusions have been reached.Mohol said, ""I just want to inform you all that our investigation agencies are probing the matter. Should we have faith in our own agencies or outsiders? Our agencies are working on it,"" he said, as quoted by news agency PTI.Mohol further reiterated on waiting for the final report before making any judgments. ""Once the final report is finalised, then only it will be justifiable to comment on it,"" he added, stressing the need to trust India's own investigation agencies rather than foreign media reports.This comes after an Italian media report blamed the pilots for the crash.The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) had also stepped in on Thursday to clarify the situation. They firmly stated that the investigation is still in progress. The AAIB also labeled media reports claiming the investigation's completion as ""incorrect and speculative.""The devastating accident occurred when Air India's Boeing 787-8 aircraft, bound for London Gatwick, crashed shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad on June 12, last year. The crash claimed 241 passenger lives along with 19 others, marking it as one of India's worst aviation disasters.",Civil aviation minister of state Murlidhar Mohol dismissed foreign media reports about the Air India crash investigation.

Absconders can't get anticipatory bail: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/absconders-cant-get-anticipatory-bail-sc/articleshow/128369080.cms,"NEW DELHI: The SC has directed all high courts not to grant anticipatory bail to accused persons who abscond and later, after their co-accused are acquitted on completion of trial, approach constitutional courts seeking protection from arrest.A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and Vijay Bishnoi set aside the Madhya Pradesh HC order that granted anticipatory bail to the absconding accused, directed him to surrender and apply for regular bail. It frowned upon the HC's direction to the trial court to grant bail on the day the accused moves the bail plea.Justice Bishnoi, who wrote the judgment, said, “An absconder is not entitled to the relief of anticipatory bail as a general rule, however, in certain exceptional cases, where on a perusal of the FIR, case diary and other relevant materials on record, the court is of the prima facie opinion that no case is made out against the absconding accused, then the power of granting anticipatory bail may be exercised.”The court noted that the accused was part of a mob who had not only fled but also threatened to kill an injured person for opposing his bail plea. The bench said the acquittal of the co-accused thus could not be grounds to grant him anticipatory bail as he had failed to cooperate with probe and delayed the trial.“Granting the relief of anticipatory bail... sets a bad precedent and sends a message that the law-abiding co-accused persons who stood trial were wrong to diligently attend the process of trial and further, incentivises people to evade the process of law with impunity,” the SC said.The bench directed the accused to surrender before the trial court within four weeks and seek regular bail.",A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and Vijay Bishnoi set aside the Madhya Pradesh HC order that granted anticipatory bail to the absconding accused.

2 journalist bodies condemn Rahul Gandhi talk on media impartiality,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2-journalist-bodies-condemn-rahul-gandhi-talk-on-media-impartiality/articleshow/128365214.cms,"'Let Us Do It Together': Rahul Gandhi Cuts In As Ashwini Vaishnaw, Pralhad Joshi Speak To Reporters

NEW DELHI: Two journalist bodies on Saturday criticised Congress neta Rahul Gandhi for questioning the impartiality of mediapersons, saying political leaders must use respectful language while addressing the press, especially in public spaces like the Parliament.The reaction came after Gandhi, speaking to reporters outside the Parliament earlier in the week, asked journalists to be more objective in their coverage. Responding to queries on the treasury benches considering a privilege notice against him over his recent speech on the Budget, the LoP said media should not merely repeat what it is told.Condemning the remarks, National Union of Journalists and Delhi Journalists Association issued a joint statement calling Gandhi’s comments inappropriate. “The LoP targeting and insulting media personnel in such a manner is highly condemnable,” NUJ president Ras Bihar said. He added that such statements amount to an attack on press freedom and undermine the role of media in a democracy.DJA president Rakesh Thapliyal and general secretary Pramod Kumar Singh said journalism exists to question those in power and provide accurate information to the public. Associating the media with any particular political party, they said, harms the professional dignity and independence of journalists.Rahul Gandhi had told reporters, “You are not totally employed by BJP. At least try a little bit of objective stuff. It gets really shameful. It’s too much.”","Congress neta Rahul Gandhi questioned the impartiality of mediapersons.

The legitimacy people have given to the Assembly demands that it works in that spirit,” Muntazir told the TOI outside the Assembly on Friday.“We should not say the J&K Assembly is disempowered. No party or legislator should say this. We should not use discouraging words or claim that nothing can be done through this Assembly. Even in the present setup, the Assembly is a powerful institution,” he said.“After Aug 5, 2019, people gave legitimacy to this Assembly by participating in the polls in large, unprecedented numbers not seen in the past 36 years. Now you cannot tell the same people that it is a disempowered Assembly. We must strive for political rights of J&K, but at the same time the legitimacy of this Assembly shouldn’t be negated,” he added.Muntazir, 38, entered the Assembly for the first time after winning the Budgam seat, defeating National Conference candidate Aga Syed Mahmood by 4,478 votes.The bypoll defeat was a major setback for the CM who had vacated the Budgam seat in 2024 after winning from it.Muntazir is the son of Aga Syed Hasan, a senior Shia cleric and former leader of separatist conglomerate All Parties Hurriyat Conference. Muntazir earlier worked as a grassroots activist before entering electoral politics.Muntazir, who holds an LLM degree, said Budgam has suffered nearly two decades of neglect despite its proximity to Srinagar. Since joining the Assembly, he regularly raises concerns about roads, education, drinking water and healthcare in his constituency, where literacy levels remain low. “In the past 20 years, the same party (NC) represented Budgam. People were given only rhetoric, but political rhetoric has a shelf life,” he said. “The people voted for change because their dignity and basic needs were ignored for a long time.”He said the CM had earlier assured the establishment of a National Law University in Budgam and the promise was made in the House. “It must be honoured. The empowerment of the J&K Assembly lies in delivering what is promised in the House,” he said.",PDP's Aga Syed Muntazir won the Budgam assembly seat vacated by Omar Abdullah in the Nov 2025 bypoll.

After Ajit Pawar, Maharashtra Faces Power Vacuum As NCP And Alliances Enter Uncharted Territory

(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: The Sharad Pawar-led faction of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) on Saturday dismissed what it termed a “perception” that it had been aggressively pursuing a merger with the rival NCP group headed by Ajit Pawar , who died in a plane crash last month.The final decision on a merger was to take place after the recent local body polls and its framework was to be decided through discussions, according to NCP (SP) Maharashtra unit chief Shashikant Shinde.""A perception is being created that we were pushing aggressively for a merger. This is not correct. We have now decided to rebuild our party. The issue (of merger) has been closed by the NCP (SP),"" Shinde told reporters in Mumbai.“There is no point in discussing a possible merger as there is no leader left to hold talks with,” he added, referring to Ajit Pawar, who had split the undivided NCP in July 2023 and aligned with the BJP and the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena faction.The Election Commission recognises the Ajit Pawar faction as the “real” NCP.Shinde also referred to his article on the late Maharashtra deputy chief minister, who was serving his sixth term in the post at the time of his death and was the state’s longest-serving deputy chief minister.The NCP criticised the piece — published in the February 2026 edition of the NCP (SP) mouthpiece ""Rashtravadi"" — alleging that it contained “false and misleading” claims about the circumstances under which the Maratha leader exited the undivided party.In the article, Shinde wrote that “manoeuvres by invisible forces, threats, and a web of false allegations” had created a situation that compelled Ajit Pawar to leave the parent organisation, resulting in the split in the party founded by his uncle Sharad Pawar Clarifying his remarks, the NCP (SP) MLC said he had not suggested that Ajit Pawar had made a mistake. “I only said he wanted to rectify the division of the party,” he stated.Meanwhile, Maharashtra minister and senior NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal questioned the need for ""daily discussions"" on a potential merger.“Sunetra Pawar (Ajit Pawar’s wife) is now the deputy CM and will soon be the NCP national president. She will discuss the matter and take a call,” Bhujbal said.“When Sunetra Pawar was sworn in as deputy CM, there was criticism about the haste. Why is there similar haste in talking about a merger?” he asked.","The Election Commission recognises the Ajit Pawar faction as the “real’ NCP.

'To Remove Corrupt DMK': TTV Dhinakaran Meets Goyal As AMMK Rejoins NDA Ahead Of Tamil Nadu Polls

(With ANI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu's ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) on Saturday responded sharply to alleged objectionable comments made by state BJP president Nainar Nagendran about actor-politician Vijay and actor Trisha.DMK MP Kanimozhi NVN Somu condemned the remarks, calling it “uncivilised” to target the personal lives of those engaged in active politics. She also criticised women leaders in the Tamil Nadu BJP for not speaking out against Nagendran.“Criticising the personal life of someone involved in politics in the public sphere is uncivilised. Moreover, speaking in a way that degrades the dignity and honour of a woman who has no connection to politics is an act that tarnishes womanhood. For Mr Nainar Nagendran, the female leaders in the BJP remaining silent without condemning this is an injustice,” Kanimozhi posted on X.Another DMK MP, Tamizhachi Thangapandian, also criticised Nagendran, saying it was “unbecoming” of the Tamil Nadu unit president of a party that leads the Union government to make disparaging remarks about a woman expressing political views while travelling in public. She added that civilised politics requires treating women with ""dignity and respect.""“It is not seemly for the Tamil Nadu state president of the party ruling India to speak disparagingly about a woman travelling in public while expressing political opinions. Speaking of and treating women with dignity is what constitutes civilised politics,” Thangapandian wrote on X.The controversy erupted after Nagendran commented on Vijay’s recent rally in Salem. Referring to the actor’s lack of political experience, he suggested that Vijay should focus on his family and “come out of actor Trisha.""Vijay, who founded and heads the Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK), earlier addressed supporters in Salem ahead of the 2026 Tamil Nadu assembly elections. He said that while his party may lack political experience, it does not have ""experience in corruption.""“Other than scamming experience, what are the other qualities do the people who question my experience have? We don’t have experience, yes. We don’t have experience in looting,” he said, in an attack on the DMK.His remarks followed Tamil Nadu and DMK supremo chief minister MK Stalin announcing that Rs 5,000 had been credited to women beneficiaries under the Kalaignar Women’s Rights Scheme.

PM Modi Declares Countdown For DMK Exit, Calls It A Government Of Corruption, Mafia, And Crime

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Manickam Tagore on Saturday pushed his party’s demand for a larger share of seats in its alliance with the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam , led by chief minister MK Stalin , ahead of the Tamil Nadu assembly elections. He said the Congress was seeking constituencies that the DMK had lost in the 2021 polls and emphasised that ""power-sharing was essential"" in state's governance. However, days earlier, Stalin ruled out the possibility of sharing power with allies.Tagore’s remarks came in response to comments made by DMK leader and state minister RS Raja Kannappan in Madurai on February 13, where he asserted that the DMK would contest 170 constituencies and win 160 seats in the upcoming election.Reacting to the statement, Tagore, the MP from Virudhunagar, said in a post on X: “In 2021, you contested in 173 seats and secured 133. What we are asking (now) are the seats which you failed to win.”He further underlined the Congress’s position on governance, saying, “Power sharing is necessary. The share in power is our right. The people will decide,” while sharing a video clip of Raja Kannappan’s speech.In the video, Raja Kannappan ruled out the possibility of a coalition government, expressing confidence that the DMK would independently secure 160 seats.The Tamil Nadu Assembly has 234 seats, and the DMK-Congress alliance had won 151 seats in the 2021 elections.Days earlier, CM Stalin strongly ruled out sharing power with allies, while maintaining that the alliance with the Congress remained “intact” and free of confusion. “We also know that it will not work in Tamil Nadu; they (Congress) know it too. It is a problem created by some people. They are deliberately conspiring to see if there will be a rift in the alliance. We are not worried about it. Rahul Gandhi is not worried either,” Stalin said.Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president K Selvaperunthagai announced in Chennai that formal alliance talks between the Congress and the DMK would begin on February 22. He asserted that the INDIA bloc remained united despite attempts by the Bharatiya Janata Party to weaken the alliance.“The election process is going very, very smoothly. Negotiations are ongoing, and we are going to start on February 22. Nothing the BJP is thinking will happen. The BJP wants to pull someone out of the INDIA alliance to split the vote bank, but it will not happen. We are intact with the alliance,” Selvaperunthagai told reporters.Responding to remarks by actor-politician Vijay, who recently said “SOP” in Tamil Nadu stood for “Stalin Operating Procedure,” Selvaperunthagai said such procedures were common across all political parties.","Congress MP Manickam Tagore pushed his party’s demand for a larger share of seats in its alliance with the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam.

NEW DELHI: A second death was reported in connection with actor-turned-politician Vijay’s Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) rally in Salem on Saturday. A man allegedly died after consuming poison near the gathering venue.A 50-year-old man identified as Murugan died at Vijay's rally. The deceased was a porter from Mettur whose body was discovered directly in front of the meeting area.According to police, Murugan had travelled to Salem and reportedly consumed a lethal mixture of poison and alcohol, news agency ANI reported.Investigators recovered a letter left by Murugan citing ongoing family issues as the motive.While the act appears personal in nature, its proximity to the high-profile political event has drawn significant attention. A case has been registered, and his family has arrived at Salem Government Hospital to claim his body following a postmortem.Murugan’s death is the second fatality linked to the Salem event.Earlier, a 37-year-old man named Suraj, who was identified as a silver-industry labourer originally from Maharashtra, collapsed while attending the meeting as a spectator.Despite being rushed to a nearby private hospital, he was declared dead from an apparent heart attack.Suraj is survived by his wife and a young child.These back-to-back incidents have reignited concerns over safety and crowd management at TVK events, following a devastating stampede in Karur months ago that claimed nearly 40 lives.The atmosphere turned volatile following Suraj’s collapse. As journalists attempted to cover the medical emergency, a violent scuffle broke out between members of the press and TVK cadres.Journalists on the scene alleged that party workers physically attacked them to prevent documentation of the incident, leading to a tense standoff despite the heavy police deployment stationed at the venue.","A 50-year-old man identified as Murugan died at Vijay's rally.

All About Northeast' First Emergency Landing Facility In Assam Which IAF Will Use During Wars

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Pawan Khera on Saturday took swipe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his visit to Assam and not the neighbouring state of Manipur while booking a ticket for him from Guwahati to Imphal.In a post on X, Khera took a swipe at the Prime Minister, saying Manipur should not be ""abandoned"" at a time when it has been witnessing unrest since 2023. He argued that the Prime Minister’s presence could have a reassuring impact on people in the troubled state.""Dear PM Narendra Modi , we understand that poll-bound states are always your top priority. But Manipur should not be abandoned. The state has been burning since 2023 — and it is burning again,"" Khera wrote.Noting that PM Modi was in Assam, he added that Manipur was ""just an hour away"" and appealed to him to extend his visit to Imphal. In a sarcastic gesture, Khera also shared what he said were flight tickets from Guwahati to Imphal, urging the Prime Minister to ""show that the PM cares"".The appeal comes amid renewed tension in parts of Manipur. On February 6, protests against the swearing-in of the state’s new deputy chief ministers, Nemcha Kipgen and Losii Dikho, turned violent in Churachandpur district as security forces clashed with demonstrators.Police said the unrest began around 6 pm in the Tuibong Main Market area, where a large group of young protesters attempted to push security personnel back to their barracks. Earlier in the week, miscreants also set fire to several houses in villages around Litan in Ukhrul district, officials said.According to Manipur Police, while the situation in the affected areas remains tense, it has largely been brought under control. A joint control room has been set up at Litan police station to coordinate security measures, and senior officers are camping in the area to closely monitor developments.Police added that the overall law-and-order situation across the state remained normal over the past 24 hours.Meanwhile, PM Modi made a historic landing at the first Emergency Landing Facility (ELF) of the northeast aboard the C-130J aircraft in Dibrugarh district.PM Modi took off from the Chabua airfield after his arrival, and landed at the ELF in Moran on a stretch of National Highway-37.The Rs 100-crore ELF, a 4.2-km reinforced stretch on the Moran Bypass, which was inaugurated by the PM, will act as a strategic and multi-functional runway for IAF fighter jets and transport aircraft, strengthening defence, logistics and disaster response, officials said.The facility is designed for both civil and military use, serving as an alternative to the Dibrugarh airport in case of emergency, they said.The PM was received at the ELF by chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, Union minister Sarbananda Sonowal, Air Chief Marshal AP Singh and other ministers of the Assam cabinet.","Congress leader Pawan Khera took a swipe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his visit to Assam and not the neighbouring state of Manipur. He argued that the Prime Minister’s presence could have a reassuring impact on people in the troubled state.

Farmer Meet Video Sparks Row As Piyush Goyal, Shivraj Chouhan Counters Rahul Gandhi On US Trade Pact

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday escalated his attack on the finalised India-US trade deal, claiming that the agreement would harm India’s cotton farmers and textile exporters.In a post on X, Rahul alleged that the government has walked into a “trap” that leaves millions of families staring into an “abyss of unemployment.”“18% Tariff versus 0% – Let me explain how the Prime Minister, a master at telling lies, and his Cabinet are spreading confusion on this. And how they’re deceiving the country’s cotton farmers and textile exporters through the India-US trade deal.”Rahul said that after India’s garments were subjected to an 18% tariff in the US market, he raised in Parliament the issue of the special concession being given to Bangladesh. According to him, a minister responded, “If we want the same benefit, we’ll have to import cotton from the US.”The LoP in Lok Sabha claimed that Bangladesh was being given a 0% tariff on garment exports to the US on the condition that it imports American cotton. Bangladesh is signalling that it might reduce or even stop importing cotton from India, he said.Questioning the policy, Gandhi said, “Is it really any kind of option – or a trap designed to corner us in a ‘damned if you do, damned if you don’t’ situation? If we import American cotton, our own farmers will be ruined.If we don’t, our textile industry will fall behind and be destroyed.”Earlier as well, Rahul Gandhi had criticised the Centre over the agreement with Washington, alleging that the deal “betrays our food security and farmers,” and claiming that PM Modi opened India’s agricultural market because US President Donald Trump “has him by the throat.”The remarks come after Union commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal on Friday rejected Gandhi’s criticism and accused him of misleading farmers.In a video post on X, Goyal said, “Mr Rahul Gandhi has once again rolled out a stage-managed, most artificial and fake narrative. This time, he is shooting from the shoulders of a few Congress party activists, who are pretending to be farmer leaders - in a completely artificial, and baseless conversation.”Goyal on Saturday speaking to reporters said, ""They have no plan other than to create confusion... They don't even have any issue to criticise us, except lies and deceit. They confuse our farmers by telling lies every day. I am confident that discredited leaders like Rahul Gandhi and his alliance... no matter how hard they try, will not be able to stop the Prime Minister from serving the country with a spirit of service and dedication. ""Goyal said the government had fully protected farmers’ interests in the agreement and that he stood by that statement “on record and with full responsibility.”He added that the deal would benefit farmers, fishermen, youth, MSMEs, startups and artisans, and would not harm agricultural producers.",Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday escalated his attack on the finalised India-US trade deal.

The date has since been remembered as a “Black Day” in the country’s security narrative.The convoy consisted of 78 buses carrying nearly 2,500 CRPF personnel from Jammu to Srinagar when an explosives-laden vehicle rammed into one of the buses, causing massive casualties and destruction.The attack drew widespread international condemnation and led to an immediate tightening of security protocols across Jammu and Kashmir. The Pakistan-based militant group Jaish-e-Mohammad claimed responsibility, stating that a suicide bomber carried out the assault, according to local media reports.In response, India initiated a series of counter-terror measures, most notably conducting airstrikes on alleged terror training camps across the border in Pakistan. The military action marked a sharp escalation in tensions between the two countries.Beyond its immediate impact, the Pulwama attack reignited global debate over cross-border terrorism, militancy in Jammu and Kashmir, and the broader security dynamics between India and Pakistan.",PM Narendra Modi on Saturday paid tributes to the soldiers killed in the Pulwama attack 7 years ago.

"Ladakh: Centre rejects Sixth Schedule, statehood for Ladakh, offers council",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-rejects-sixth-schedule-statehood-for-ladakh-offers-council/articleshow/128273026.cms,"JAMMU: The Centre has made it clear that Ladakh will not be granted Sixth Schedule status or statehood, two key demands of Leh Apex Body (LAB) and Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA), the region’s two major political organisations said after talks in New Delhi last week.The Sixth Schedule of the Constitution allows special administrative arrangements for tribal areas to safeguard autonomy, culture and land. Speaking publicly for the first time after the Feb 4 talks with a Union home ministry (MHA) high-powered committee, Ladakh leaders said the Centre had instead offered a “territorial council” model.Under this proposal, chief executive councillor of Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council (LAHDC) will be designated as CM and the deputy chief executive councillor as deputy CM.“We call it a farce. LAB and KDA rejected it (the offer), except for one KDA member, Kunzes Dolma,” KDA co-chairman Asgar Ali Karbali said at a gathering in Kargil on Wednesday.According to Karbali, Dolma had earlier supported KDA’s agenda and was nominated as a member for the talks. “She told the high-powered committee that a conspiracy was hatched to remove her and that she is satisfied with the Union Territory status for Ladakh.We will not tolerate anyone, whether Dolma or anyone else, who plays with Ladakhi identity,” Karbali said.As Karbali spoke, many in the Kargil gathering raised slogans against Dolma and chanted support for Sonam Wangchuk, LAB member and climate activist jailed over violence in Sept 2025 during statehood protests in Leh.After the talks negotiations with the MHA committee headed by junior Union home minister Home Nityanand Rai, Karbali and Ladakh Buddhist Association (LBA) president Tsering Dorje Lakrook had described the talks as inconclusive.“When we reiterated Sixth Schedule status and statehood, they (MHA officials) argued that the Sixth Schedule has become ‘defunct’ and largely powerless. We disagreed. Supreme Court has repeatedly held Sixth Schedule as a law in itself and a strong constitutional safeguard. If it is powerful in the Northeastern states, why is it suddenly being called weak for Ladakh?” Karbali said.On statehood, Karbali said the MHA’s main objection was that Ladakh lacks sufficient financial resources. “When we asked that our legal experts be allowed to explain this, we were told they could not be called into the meeting. There is no Indian state that has every resource within its own territory,” Karbali argued.He reiterated the LAB and the KDA remain united in pressing for Sixth Schedule status and statehood as their core demands.","The Centre has made it clear that Ladakh will not be granted Sixth Schedule status or statehood, the region’s two major political organisations said after talks in New Delhi last week.

Extortion threats are prompting families in Peel Region to leave Canada as the police departments are still trying to get a better handle on these cases as they cross provincial and international borders, Toronto City News reported.Dharmjit, an Indian-origin man, who became the target of the extortion gang late last year, said the police do not have enough resources to fight the criminals. Dharmjit said he started receiving extortion calls in October 2025. He informed the police blocked all the numbers. But the extortion calls never stopped coming. And then there was a firing at his farm on November 25. Dharmjit said the cops advised them to stay away from that residence. They did that. But when they returned, the gunfire too returned.“So if the police cannot protect you, the police have nothing to protect you. So what do you do? They say, leave from your house, leave your house. Where do you go? Why do you want to buy another house in the same area or the same country? Better leave the country,” Dharmjit said.“They start in October, calling me about money. Then I informed the police. So I blocked the number, then they started calling from another number, and I blocked this number.Then they come on November 25th at my farm, they shoot, at night,” he said.Extortion targeting Indians has become a normal thing in Canada, with local government calling on the federal government for help in fighting this organized crime.

Candace Drops 'SECRET' TPUSA Tape: Erika Kirk Heard Laughing Days After Charlie Kirk’s Killing

Candace Owens under fire after interview details complicate grooming allegation





A social media clash between commentator Candace Owens and critics escalated this week after a viral post accused her of stretching the meaning of serious allegations for effect. The flashpoint centers on claims that Owens suggested someone was “grooming” a 15 year old, only for details from her own interview to complicate that narrative.The backlash gathered pace when a verified user, Natly Denise, challenged Owens’ framing and questioned whether the term itself was being misused. The dispute has since spilled across platforms, pulling in past controversies and reigniting debate over how powerful words are deployed in public discourse.Natly Denise wrote: “So Candace and her little Cantifa podcast circle float this grotesque angle that Erika was ‘grooming’ a 15-year-old. Then Candace interviews the girl herself… and confirms they only hung out once. So does Candace even know what ‘grooming’ means, or is she just stretching words like cheap elastic until they snap?She further added, ""She’s already twisted the definition of human trafficking to protect Tate, and now she’s warping the meaning of grooming just to smear Erika.Absolutely vile.”Candace Owens, for her part, described the relationship differently during her show. She said: “And curiously, get this, she tells me that she and Erica actually never hung out in person beyond that first meeting. So this was purely meant to be an electronic, a platonic relationship where Erica said stuff even like this to her on Instagram, Jillian, that dime piece beside the car though, she's referring to Jillian just so you, just so we're clear, she's referring to Jillian beside a car. ”The fundamental conflict is based on the definition and purpose. The word limited contact, according to critics, runs the danger of watering down a word that is commonly linked with continuous manipulation. Even though there is no repeat face-to-face interaction, supporters argue that online interactions could also be something to worry about.More than a single exchange is involved. Such terms as grooming and trafficking have a legal and moral connotation. Whenever they emerge in political commentary, listeners pay attention. The dispute has become a wider cultural clash about the way prejudices are put across and the way words are used to make people think.",A viral post has intensified debate over Candace Owens’ use of the term grooming.

NOIDA: A 32-year-old man and a 28-year-old woman were found dead with gunshot wounds inside a locked car in Sector 107 on Saturday afternoon. Police are investigating the twin deaths as murder-suicide, based on a message in the man's phone that indicated he had killed his ex-girlfriend before turning the gun on himself.The two were identified as Rekha, a resident of Salarpur in Noida, and Sumit Kumar, a resident of Trilokpuri in Delhi. Rekha worked in a private company in Sector 62, while Sumit had a mineral water plant business.The deaths were discovered around 1pm on Saturday when locals found a suspiciously parked car near Dadri Road, close to pillar no 84, police said. The vehicle had been stationary for a long time. Passersby found a man, with a gun in his hand, and a woman, bleeding and unconscious in their seats, after which they alerted the police.A team from the Sector 39 police station broke open a window and discovered both dead from head gunshot wounds. They recovered a pistol, two spent cartridges, and confirmed the weapon was illegal.Separately, police are also looking at a message purportedly typed by Sumit on WhatsApp at 3.39pm on Friday. In the message, Sumit wrote that the two had been in a relationship for 15 years and had plans to get married.However, he wrote, Rekha recently decided to marry someone else, which prompted him to take the extreme step.It was not immediately clear if he sent the message to anyone or saved it for himself.Rekha's family, meanwhile, claimed Sumit had been harassing her and a complaint was filed in the past. The matter was later resolved after he apologised and assured that he would not trouble her again, the family alleged. Rekha's brother said the couple's relationship had become strained in recent months as her family was arranging her marriage elsewhere because they belonged to different castes.Both families had filed missing person complaints on Friday – Rekha's at Sector 58 police station in Noida and Sumit's in Delhi.Investigators said it was likely the two planned the meeting in advance. Police are scanning CCTV footage from over 50 cameras in the area to determine when Rekha left her office and where she met Sumit. According to police sources, Rekha's family said she usually returned home by 7pm. When she did not on Friday, they approached a local police outpost later in the night. Her phone remained off through Friday but was switched on around 7am on Saturday. Calls to it went unanswered.This indicates one or both was alive at the time and the shootings happened later in the morning on Saturday.Sumit's brother Sachin questioned the circumstance of their deaths and said the spot where the car was found was less than a kilometre from Rekha's house. He demanded a thorough investigation to rule out foul play.Additional deputy commissioner of police Manisha Singh told reporters, ""Forensic teams were called to the spot. Blood samples, the weapon, and other material evidence were collected. Ballistic examination of the pistol will help determine the sequence of firing, the distance from which the shots were fired, and other crucial details,"" she said.Officials said mobile phone data of both the deceased will be examined to reconstruct their movements and conversations prior to the incident. This is important because it will determine whether they spent the entire time in the car since they met on Friday evening, went somewhere or met someone.","Man, 32, and woman, 28, found dead in locked car in Noida on Saturday afternoon.

"Lucknow: Woman dies during childbirth; Class 12 student, BA graduate held for illegal C-section",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/class-12-student-arts-grad-perform-c-sec-woman-dies/articleshow/128358758.cms,"LUCKNOW: In a glaring example of medical negligence and quackery, the Ambedkar Nagar police on Friday arrested a class 12 student and an Arts graduate for allegedly conducting a caesarean surgery at an unregistered private hospital, resulting in the death of a woman during childbirth. Probe revealed the illegal hospital had been running for five years.The accused were identified as Yogesh Verma (32), a BA graduate from Malipur, and Shubham Vishwakarma (19), an intermediate student from Sultanpur. The duo allegedly performed surgeries at Navjeevan Hospital in Baskhari without possessing any recognised medical degree or surgical qualification.The deceased, Priyanka, was admitted to the hospital on February 5 for delivery.According to police, the duo conducted a caesarean section, after which she delivered a baby girl. However, Priyanka allegedly suffered excessive bleeding and never regained consciousness following the administration of anaesthesia. As her condition deteriorated, she was referred to Lucknow, but she died.The incident triggered protests by the victim's family, after which the hospital operator, identified as Ruby, fled the spot and remains absconding.The police seized mobile phones linked to the case and launched efforts to trace her.Baskhari SHO Sunil Kumar Pandey, who is leading the investigation, said that two so-called ""doctors"" were called in to conduct the surgery. ""Yogesh Verma is only a graduate. His father worked as a ward boy at CHC Jalalpur, and he learned basic medical procedures while assisting him. He reportedly performed surgeries for several years,"" the SHO said.The second accused, Shubham Vishwakarma, is associated with Bajrang Nursing Home in Belwai under Akhandnagar police station limits of Sultanpur district.During questioning, he told police that he gained experience by observing procedures at a local hospital after completing his class 12. Both the accused allegedly arrived on call to conduct surgeries at Navjeevan Hospital, which had been operating for nearly 5 years.Police sources revealed that the duo allegedly charged between Rs 3,000 and Rs 5,000 per caesarean operation—significantly lower than qualified surgeons—attracting poor patients seeking affordable treatment.Following directions from the Chief Medical Officer, a joint inspection was conducted on the night of February 8 by the CHC superintendent, sub-divisional magistrate Tanda, and Baskhari police. During the inspection, officials found that the hospital operated illegally from four rooms of a residential building without any registration certificate, biomedical waste (BMW) authorisation, fire NOC, or required medical staff as per norms.""No signboard displaying hospital registration details was found on the premises. Various medicines, surgical and medical equipment were recovered from the site. After preparing an inventory, authorities sealed all the four rooms in the presence of the SDM and police,"" said Dr Ajay Kumar, CHC superintendent.An FIR was lodged on February 9 on the complaint of the CHC superintendent under relevant sections for the illegal operation of a hospital and medical negligence. Police said further investigation is on to identify other hospitals where the accused may have performed surgeries.Authorities also ordered verification of all medical credentials linked to the hospital and warned of strict action against illegal healthcare establishments operating in the district.Police said that Priyanka's husband Sandeep lodged another FIR under the charges of BNS 105 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), and efforts are on to catch Ruby.","Police arrest a class 12 student and an Arts graduate for allegedly conducting a caesarean surgery at an unregistered private hospital, resulting in the death of a woman during childbirth.

Investigators said chat logs and mobile records corroborated his attempts to ""brainwash"" them.""The individuals were residents of Jahangirpuri, Ghazipur and Loni, and had reportedly paid him money on the pretext of curing ailments or increasing their wealth,"" a source said, adding, ""He allegedly collected amounts ranging from Rs 1,100 to Rs 10,000, claiming it was part of an initial healing process."" He is suspected to be linked to at least eight murders, the source said.Sources said this was only the first stage of his operation and that he could have extracted larger sums or involved the victims in more dangerous acts had he not been arrested.Police found another mobile number believed to be used by the accused and are searching for the second handset. A keypad phone has already been recovered from him, they said.Investigators also took Kamruddin to Loni and Peeragarhi to recreate the sequence of events, as these were the routes used by the accused and the victims on the day of the killings.""He was taken to the house where he ran his fake practices, then to the spot from where CCTV footage emerged and finally to Peeragarhi,"" a source said.A senior police officer said the accused initially ran a bangle business but later shifted to occult practices after seeing the possibility of earning more.

Fadnavis said the comparison was ""unacceptable"" and the Congress politician should be ""ashamed"".The controversy began after Shiv Sena corporators in Malegaon objected to the display of Tipu Sultan's portrait in the office of deputy mayor Shaan-e-Hind Nihal Ahmed. A delegation met Malegaon municipal commissioner Ravindra Jadhav, demanding that it be removed and warning of an agitation if the administration failed to act. The Malegaon Municipal Corporation (MMC) on Saturday removed a portrait of Tipu Sultan from the office.Jadhav confirmed that the administration examined the state govt's official protocol list, which outlines leaders whose anniversaries are observed and whose portraits are permitted for display in govt offices, before taking the action.""Tipu Sultan's name is not included in the protocol list. Therefore, the portrait was removed from the deputy mayor's office,"" MMC officials said.Malegaon deputy mayor Shaan-e-Hind Nihal Ahmed, on Friday and again on Saturday, said she received the Tipu Sultan portrait from some visitors and had no objection to it being put up in her office. ""Tipu Sultan fought against the British and was acknowledged for his bravery at that time. There are roads named after him in Mumbai and Nagpur. This is an attempt to divert attention from our work. Some people are unable to digest that two Muslim women are mayor and deputy mayor in Malegaon,"" she told reporters in Malegaon.When asked about the controversy, Sapkal, speaking in Buldhana on Saturday, said ""He (Tipu Sultan) waged a war against the British and was a brave warrior. He was a son of the soil. He never entertained poisonous or divisive thoughts. We should view Tipu Sultan as an equal to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj as a symbol of bravery,"" he said.Fadnavis called the comparison unacceptable. Congress ""should be ashamed of equating the founder of Hindavi Swarajya with Tipu Sultan, who butchered 1,000s of Hindus,"" he said. ""Maharashtra will not tolerate this. If there is even a little integrity left in Congress politicians, they must clarify their stand. Their allies should also make their position clear,"" he said, referring to Shiv Sena (UBT) and NCP (SP) in the Maha Vikas Aghadi alliance.Fadnavis also objected to what he described as attempts to recast historical narratives. ""History must be taught properly. The new narrative that is being written, which we condemn in the strongest words,"" he said.The remarks drew support from Chandrashekhar Bawankule, who termed the comparison ""extremely outrageous and an attack on Maharashtra's identity"". He called it ""an insult to the legendary Maratha warrior and a betrayal of history.""Later on Saturday evening, in a post on X, Sapkal said the valour of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj is unparalleled, while Tipu Sultan was valiant and a lover of Swarajya. ""It was by taking Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj as an ideal that he (Tipu Sultan) fought against the British,"" Sapkal said in the post.He further hit out by claiming those following the ideology of the Sangh-BJP were slaves and spies of the British while Tipu Sultan was fighting the foreign rulers.""Therefore, Devendra Fadnavis should not get into the pretence of teaching us history. The people of Maharashtra have not forgotten what all BJP-RSS, (former governor) Bhagatsingh Koshyari, along with others, spewed against Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, and how they disrespected him,"" Sapkal said.Posting an image, the Maharashtra Congress chief said, ""These are the pictures of both Shivaji Maharaj and Tipu Sultan on the original copy of the Constitution.""(with inputs from PTI)","The controversy began after Shiv Sena corporators in Malegaon objected to the display of Tipu Sultan's portrait in the office of deputy mayor Shaan-e-Hind Nihal Ahmed.

BHOPAL: “Jahan milenge Bunty-Babli, tod denge haddi pasli” (Wherever we run into BuntyBabli, we will break their bones and ribs): “ Mohabbat ke Sipahi” (Soldiers of Love) Valentine’s Day in Bhopal was marked largely by competing street campaigns by the right-wing Bajrang Dal and the Indian Youth Congress, pitting public morality against personal freedom.Bajrang Dal activists were seen patrolling parks and public squares across the city, focusing on areas where young people typically gather, including Upper Lake, a mall in MP Nagar, and nearby restaurants. Their stated objective was to prevent public displays of affection and discourage what they described as ‘immoral’ behaviour.As right-wingers prowled public spaces, some selfstyled activists were heard raising provocative slogans, including “ Jahan milenge Bunty-Babli, tod denge haddi pasli” (Wherever we meet Bunty-Babli, we will break their bones and ribs).The outfit framed its actions as moral policing, a practice repeated in previous years on Feb 14.“We had made it clear that there should not be any indecent or immoral conduct by couples. Such campaigns are necessary to protect our youth (from western influences),” Rakesh Prajapati, district president, Bajrang Dal, toldIn response, the Indian Youth Congress launched an initiative called “ Mohabbat ke Sipahi ” (Soldiers of Love), as part of which Youth Congress workers fanned out across the city and stationed themselves at key public spots, promising support and protection for couples who wished to ring in Valentine’s Day without the fear of incurring right-wing wrath.In response, the Indian Youth Congress launched an initiative called “Mohabbat Ke Sipahi” (Soldiers of Love), as part of which Youth Congress workers fanned out across the city and stationed themselves at key public spots, promising support and protection for couples who wished to ring in Valentine’s Day without the fear of incurring rightwing wrath.Wearing distinctive clothes and carrying banners promoting love and tolerance, they urged young couples to come out openly. Youth Congress leaders described the campaign as a pushback against “moral vigilantism.” “Our initiative was aimed at spreading love over hatred, foster brotherhood instead of discrimination, and unite society rather than divide it,” Youth Congress district president Amit Khatri said.In the city, many couples avoided public venues. Reports as well social media posts suggested that parks, eateries, and other popular rendezvous points were quieter than usual on Valentine’s Day, with couples preferring the privacy of homes over public meetings to avoid potential confrontation.Police were deployed in big numbers on the streets to prevent escalation.

He also issued death threats to the girl's brothers.Police said the girl met the accused around 7-8 months ago. During their initial acquaintance, he reportedly captured several photographs of the woman.However, as his criminal nature became apparent, the woman attempted to distance herself. The boy responded with intimidation, even visiting her house to threaten her brothers' lives, which led the woman to completely sever all communication with him.The harassment escalated to a dangerous level once the accused learned that the woman's family finalised her marriage to another man. On the night of Feb 13, just days before the wedding, he forcibly entered the survivor's home. He confronted her brother, aggressively asserting that he would not permit the marriage to proceed.When the family resisted, the accused brutally assaulted the brother, hurled abuses, and issued death threats before fleeing the scene.Later on Saturday, Meena used his Instagram account to upload and circulate the woman's photographs, aiming to tarnish her reputation and break the engagement.

MUMBAI: Sahar police arrested two cab drivers for allegedly cheating a Wadala couple of 1,000 Thai baht (about Rs 3,300) after they landed at Mumbai International Airport from Thailand on Feb 8 and hired a cab to go home.The accused, Imtiyaz Ahmad (34) and Riyasat Ali Khan (48), were arrested after an FIR was registered the next day. Police said they are checking how many other passengers may have been similarly duped.According to police, the couple -- Darshan Sawant (29), a fitness trainer, and his wife Monica -- was approached outside the terminal by a man who offered a cab to Wadala Fire Station in Antop Hill and quoted Rs 550, later agreeing to Rs 400. Khan allegedly made the couple sit in a taxi driven by Ahmad and rode along.After the taxi moved a short distance, he asked the driver to stop and demanded Rs 400 immediately, claiming he had to maintain accounts for multiple cars.The complainant, Darshan Sawant (29), said they did not have Indian currency and offered to pay via Google Pay, but Khan insisted on cash. When the couple said they had Thai currency, Khan allegedly said it would do and asked for 200 Thai baht, promising to return Rs 200.Police said Sawant's wife had 1,100 Thai baht in hand, but Khan took the money and, in a quick gesture, allegedly pocketed 1,000 Thai baht, paid the driver Rs 400, and left.After reaching home, the couple noticed the missing currency and filed a complaint the next day. Police said the taxis were seized, and an application has been made to the RTO to cancel the drivers' licences and permits.Last month, two other cab drivers were arrested for allegedly taking $200 from a US national for a 400-metre ride; police also initiated permit and licence cancellations in that case.","Two cab drivers arrested for allegedly cheating a Wadala couple of 1,000 Thai baht (about Rs 3,300) The couple landed at Mumbai International Airport from Thailand on Feb 8 and hired a cab to go home.

KOLKATA: CM Mamata Banerjee on Saturday invoked Rabindranath Tagore 's ‘Ananta Prem' (Unending Love) to pen a love-for-the-people Happy Valentine's Day message on X, her first since her debut on the social platform in May 2014.Banerjee's ""May love live long"" post comes against the backdrop of several right-wing groups publicly opposing — and even threatening — those celebrating the day.Quoting Tagore's original 1890 Bengali verses, the CM wrote: ""I seem to have loved you in numberless forms, numberless times. In life after life, age after age, forever."" She added: ""Valentine's Day is a celebration of love in all its forms and manifestations, in its widest and noblest sense; love that transcends caste, creed, class and religion. It is this spirit of love that has guided my journey in public service. A love for the people strong enough to withstand storms, patient enough to listen, and bold enough to fight for justice and dignity. Happy Valentine's Day!"" She concluded by saying, ""May love live long.""The post clocked 3,58,000 views in two hours. TMC seniors linked the message to a counter-narrative against the ""politics of hate"" that the CM has frequently criticised.Bengal BJP president Samik Bhattacharya was cautious in his response. ""I cannot comment on what others have said. But we will replace swords with pens and bombs with books. Look at the number of Muslims who were killed in West Bengal. Compare that with Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh or Gujarat.""However, CPM state secretary Md Salim said: ""We fail to understand whom she was addressing — the people or the country. After so much bloodbath, terror, killings and rapes, someone is thinking of returning to the fold of love and affection. Even if the feeling is belated, it is welcome.""‘Ananta Prem' is not only a Bengali favorite but is cherished worldwide. Several writers have noted that its English translation was among Audrey Hepburn's favorites. It is said that Hepburn loved the poem so much that during her funeral in 1993, her ‘Roman Holiday' co-star Gregory Peck recited these English verses.The closest reference in the past to Banerjee broaching this issue was during a Lok Sabha rally in Diamond Harbour ahead of the 2019 polls. At that time, the CM lashed out against ""anti-Romeo squads"" in BJP-governed states, particularly Uttar Pradesh. She dubbed it ""dangerous"".TMC, in a one-minute video on X, highlighted Banerjee's affection across all age groups in Bengal and stressed that love was not always about roses but also about standing by people during hard times and in grief, which the CM always did.","Banerjee's ""May love live long"" post comes against the backdrop of several right-wing groups publicly opposing — and even threatening — those celebrating the day.

Police Register Two FIRs, Invoke Assault Charges

(With agency inputs)





NEW DELHI: A woman YouTuber alleged on Saturday that she was assaulted and that an attempt was made to forcibly take her away during a protest at Delhi University’s North Campus a day earlier. However, a student group denied the allegations, claiming that its members were targeted instead.The YouTuber stated that she had gone to cover a protest demanding the implementation of new UGC regulations and was attacked after being asked her name.""I had gone to cover the protest, as I regularly do. Before I could even take out my mic, a person behind me tried to instigate me by repeatedly taking my name. When I asked him what the issue was, he asked for my name and caste. I told him my name and asked what had happened. After that, things escalated,"" the YouTuber said.""The entire crowd came towards me and attacked me. This is clear in the video. About 500 people attacked me. They just have fake narrations and fake allegations. The girls around me whispered rape threats in my ears just because I am a Brahmin; ""aaj tu chal, tera nanga parade niklega,"" is what they said. The men around me were saying that they would teach me a lesson.The girls had held me by the arms and neck. This is an attempt to murder. I had fallen unconscious, but the Police did nothing, "" she told ANI.YouTuber alleged that the reason the mob targeted her for her caste and that she was now registered an FIR in the case.""A boy there was signalling to others to take me away. Did they want to kidnap me? My clothes were being torn. I was being improperly touched. They were goons, they cannot be students. I was attacked due to my caste. Nobody supported me, only a few Law Faculties showed humanity, and I came out with their help as well as with that of a few women Police personnel. FIR has been registered, I trust the law .The incident occurred for about half an hour. There was mob lynching there, I escaped somehow is a big deal for me."" she claimed.""There was also a car with its gate open, and gestures were being made suggesting I be taken inside. I have filed a complaint with the police,"" she added.Meanwhile, Delhi University vice-chancellor Yogesh Singh described the incident as a matter of concern and said maintaining social harmony was everyone’s responsibility.The All India Students' Association (AISA) said in a statement that the protest over the UGC regulations was peaceful and that its activists intervened after the YouTuber allegedly created a disruption and confronted a journalist at the site.It termed the allegations ""false and motivated"" and said two of its members were later threatened and faced abuse at the police station when they went to file a complaint.The student outfit also claimed that videos circulating online do not show the full sequence of events. Multiple videos of the incident have been shared on social media with each side claiming that the onus lies with the other side.Delhi Police said two FIRs have been registered based on complaints filed by the YouTuber and a woman student affiliated with AISA.The Delhi University VC posted on X, requesting all teachers and students to maintain harmony among themselves. ""Do not engage in any activity that increases mutual discord and harms the image of the nation and the university,"" he said.Singh said students from all states of India and all communities study in the university. ""Social harmony is the greatest thing, and maintaining it is the duty of all of us,"" he wrote on X.""I have spoken with several student groups and teacher groups today and have also spoken with the police administration to ensure that no such incident occurs in the future that harms harmony. The new rules of the UGC that have come are currently under consideration in the Hon'ble Supreme Court.""I appeal to all teachers and students of the university to maintain their trust in the Government of India and await the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court,"" the VC said.Chaos marked a protest called by Left-backed student unions at Delhi University on Friday evening. The unrest followed a separate protest organised by the All India Forum for Equity to observe ‘All India Vanchit Adhikar Divas’ at the Arts Faculty, which allegedly witnessed scenes of violence. The students were demanding that the University Grants Commission (UGC) Regulations address and eliminate caste discrimination on campuses across India.A face-off between two student groups triggered claims and counter-claims, with each side accusing the other of violence and intimidation. According to the Left-backed student union AISA, some students were allegedly threatened and subjected to casteist abuse and slurs by a rival group.AISA activists further claimed that when they went to a local police station to register an FIR against the alleged attackers, members of the rival group ABVP — affiliated with the BJP — attacked them.In its statement the AISA said, ""Delhi Police repeatedly failed to disperse the attacking mob and even if they moved away this mob kept coming back. While the lawyer of the students inside was not allowed to enter the police station, the people against whom the complaint was being made entered and with them some goons even entered the station.""""The mob at this time became even more agitated and tried to surround those who had come in solidarity against the mob attack in order to attack them. Instead of removing the violent crowd, the police stood by and watched as the mob raised slogans like ""Desh ke gaddaron ko, goli maro salon ko"" (Shoot the traitors of the country), ""Brahmanwad Zindabad"" (Long live Brahmanism) and other violent gestures aimed particularly women comrades,"" AISA alleged in its statement.Countering these allegations, ABVP alleged that a female journalist, associated with a YouTube channel was allegedly assaulted by Left backed student activists. ABVP said that the incident exposes the violent character of Left-affiliated student organisations, which otherwise claim to champion freedom of expression across universities in the country.Meanwhile, a senior police officer said that FIRs have been filed in the case, and they have begun an inquiry.""Two FIRs have been registered, including one where the complainant is a female YouTuber and another, a female student from AISA. Both the FIRs have been registered under Sections 74 (assault or criminal force against a woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 115(2) (voluntarily causing hurt), 126(2) (wrongful restraint) and 3(5) (common intention) of the BNS. Further action will be taken accordingly,"" the officer said.","YouTuber claims she was attacked after being asked her name.

DEHRADUN: In a major breakthrough in the probe into the daylight murder of 54-year-old Jharkhand gangster Vikram Sharma in Dehradun on Friday morning, Uttarakhand police on Saturday claimed to have unravelled the conspiracy and identified all three assailants.A senior officer at the police headquarters (PHQ), monitoring the investigation, told TOI that Sharma was ""killed on the directions of gangster Akhilesh Singh"", who is currently lodged in Dumka Central Jail in Jharkhand. Sharma had allegedly mentored Singh in the past, helping him establish himself in the criminal network.""It emerged during the probe that there was a dispute between the two over the sharing of extortion money. Since Singh is in jail, Sharma allegedly siphoned off a larger share, which enraged him. Over the same dispute, Singh had attempted to eliminate Sharma two months ago during his visit to Jharkhand but failed. On Friday, he succeeded,"" said the officer, requesting anonymity.Sharma, who was named in more than 50 criminal cases, including the 2007 murder of Sreeleathers co-owner Ashish Dey in Jamshedpur, was out on bail.He had been living in a rented apartment in Dehradun for over a year and regularly visited a gym inside a shopping complex on Rajpur Road. He was shot dead by three unidentified assailants on Friday morning after stepping out of the gym.The officer said police have identified all three accused and traced the route they took to flee the scene. ""After escaping on a motorbike, they reached Haridwar and stayed in a hotel for a few hours before boarding a train to leave the state. They have been identified and will be arrested soon. The investigation also revealed that Sharma was shot in the head from behind at point-blank range, indicating the attackers were professional and intended to leave no chance of survival,"" he added.When contacted, Uttarakhand DGP Deepam Seth declined to share further details, citing the ongoing investigation. ""However, we can confirm that the motive behind the murder has been established and the shooters, who are from Jharkhand, have been identified. Uttarakhand STF teams are coordinating with their counterparts in Jharkhand to arrest the accused at the earliest,"" Seth said.","Jharkhand gangster Vikram Sharma, 54, was shot dead in Dehradun on Friday.

Huge Crisis In US: Shutdown Hits DHS Amid Immigration Ops; Dems Block Funding Over ICE Actions





Former US President Barack Obama criticised immigration enforcement operations in Minnesota, calling it ""rogue behavior"" typical of authoritarian regimes.In an interview released Saturday with political commentator Brian Tyler Cohen, Obama said recent actions by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers were deeply troubling.""The rogue behavior of agents of the federal government is deeply concerning and dangerous,"" he said, as quoted by AFP.He added that such conduct resembled patterns historically associated with dictatorships.""In the past we've seen in authoritarian countries and we've seen in dictatorships.""The remarks follow weeks of sweeping raids and arrests in Minnesota involving thousands of federal agents. The operations were described by the Trump administration as targeted missions against criminals before being halted earlier this week. The crackdown included two fatal shootings that intensified pressure on President Donald Trump.Trump’s immigration adviser Tom Homan announced Thursday that the operation had ended following large protests and nationwide backlash.Despite his criticism, Obama expressed optimism about public resistance to the raids, praising communities that mobilized against them.""Not just randomly, but in a systematic, organized way, citizens saying, 'this is not the America we believe in,' and we're going to fight back, and we're going to push back with the truth and with cameras and with peaceful protests,"" he said.""That kind of heroic, sustained behavior in subzero weather by ordinary people is what should give us hope. As long as we have folks doing that, I feel like we're going to get through this.""In the wide-ranging interview, Obama also reacted for the first time to a social media post by Trump that depicted him and former First Lady Michelle Obama as monkeys. Obama described it as a decline in shame and decorum in US political discourse.","Former US President Barack Obama criticised immigration enforcement operations in Minnesota.
