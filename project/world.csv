MUMBAI: A joint team of forest department and BMC officials inspected actor Shah Rukh Khan 's bungalow, Mannat, at Bandra Bandstand, on Friday following a complaint about coastal regulation zone (CRZ) violations during renovation of the property.The property comprises Mannat, a heritage structure, and an annex structure, a multi-storey building. As Khan and his family have shifted to a nearby place due to the renovation, the officials were met by his staff who told them they would submit all documents concerning the permissions obtained.Pooja Dadlani, Khan's manager, said ""There are no complaints. All work is going on as per guidelines.""The property is undergoing renovation, and clearances were earlier sought from the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) for it. The renovation included adding two additional floors to the annexe structure.A forest department official said, ""A team carried out a site inspection as we received a complaint about renovation permissions. A report will be prepared based on findings and submitted soon.""An official, who was part of the team, said the staff present at the site told them they would submit all documents concerning the permissions obtained.The BMC's H-West ward building and factory department and the building proposal department officials were asked to accompany the forest team for carrying out the inspection. ""Our officials were accompanying the team, based on a request by the forest department. We had no other role,"" said a BMC official.Activist Santosh Daundkar had earlier lodged a complaint with the BMC regarding the construction at Mannat.Former IPS officer and lawyer Y P Singh Friday alleged the layout of Mannat comprised one main heritage building called Villa Vienna as per the heritage regulations. ""The name of this building was changed to Mannat later. In 2005, an extension building of seven floors was made behind the heritage bungalow and since at that time Urban Land Ceiling Act was in force, a large apartment could not have been made. To overcome this legal hurdle, approval for 12 small independent flats was taken from the BMC by the owners namely Shah Rukh Khan and Gauri Khan. However, once the approval was obtained, all these 12 small flats, which were essentially meant for mass housing under the Act, were merged and a super luxury accommodation of a single family was constructed,"" said Singh.","A joint team of forest department and BMC officials inspected actor Shah Rukh Khan's bungalow, Mannat, at Bandra Bandstand.

Operation Sindoor

NEW DELHI: Dragging his feet to the truth after repeated denials, Pakistan’s deputy prime minister Ishaq Dar on Thursday admitted that India struck Rawalpindi's Nur Khan airbase and the Shorkot airbase during Operation Sindoor , which was carried to avenge the Pahalgam terrorist attack, in which ISI-groomed terrorists killed 26 civilians.India attacked the Nur Khan and Shorkot airbases on the intervening night of May 6 and 7. Within 45 minutes of the strike, Saudi Prince Faisal offered to speak to external affairs minister S Jaishankar on behalf of Pakistan's deputy PM, seeking to halt further action against Pakistan.Dar's statement strongly suggests that Islamabad desperately scrambled to find help in persuading India to halt its kinetic action, which was ""precise, measured and non-escalatory"". Pakistan air force Base Nur Khan, situated in Chaklala, Rawalpindi is around 10km from Islamabad, Pakistan capital. It is an active airbase that encompasses the former Benazir Bhutto International Airport within its grounds.The facility, originally established as RAF Station Chaklala and later known as PAF Base Chaklala, continues to serve as a vital military installation in Pakistan.The base is also home to PAF College Chaklala, which trains Aviation Cadets, and Fazaia Inter College Nur Khan, providing additional educational facilities on the premises.Imtiaz Gul, a defence analyst, claimed that the strategically important Nur Khan airbase in Rawalpindi is “under American control.”Pakistan air force base Rafiqui, situated near Shorkot in Jhang District, is a major military installation located 337 kilometers south of Islamabad. The base features a 10,000-foot runway with a parallel taxiway that serves as an emergency landing strip.The airbase was previously known as PAF Base Shorkot before being renamed after Sarfaraz Ahmed Rafiqui, a fighter pilot from the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965.The base's infrastructure includes a primary runway and an emergency taxiway system that allows for aircraft recovery operations when needed.Operation Sindoor was India's swift, calculated tri‑service cross-border assault on the dead night of May 6 and 7, targeting nine terror camps deep inside Pakistan and Pakistan‑occupied Kashmir in retaliation for the brutal April 22 Pahalgam massacre that claimed 26 innocent lives.Within 25 minutes, India’s Army, Navy and Air Force deployed SCALP cruise missiles, HAMMER smart bombs, loitering munitions and ground-to-ground weaponry, killing around 70 to 100 militants and crippling key Lashkar‑e‑Taiba, JeM and Hizbul Mujahideen infrastructure at Bahalwalpur and Muridke in Pakistan.Pahalgam's terrorists thought they were sending a message when they murdered husbands in front of their wives, after selecting victims by their religion. Via the name Operation Sindoor, the government sent an immeasurably bigger message back as India avenged the loss suffered by those women.Sindoor, vermillion, is a symbol of marriage in Hindu custom. Pakistan's military-intelligence-jihadi complex would have been among the first to note the image put out by Indian Army right after government's confirmation of the strikes - Operation Sindoor in block letters, with the first 'O' represented by a bowl of vermillion.","India attacked the Nur Khan and Shorkot airbases on the intervening night of May 6 and 7.

Regional conflict still looms large





A week into the war between Israel and Iran, tensions continue to rise as missile strikes, and drone attacks continue . The conflict was triggered by Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear and military targets last Friday, prompting swift retaliation from Tehran. Hundreds have died, and fears are mounting of a wider regional escalation.Also read: Iran strikes southern Israel; thick black smoke fills sky as missile hits high-rise apartment In the midst of this turmoil, US President Donald Trump said he will decide within two weeks whether the United States will intervene militarily, depending on the prospect of renewed nuclear negotiations. Israeli leaders, meanwhile, continue to issue aggressive statements, with Defence Minister Israel Katz saying Iran's Supreme Leader “should not continue to exist.”The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it carried out a large-scale overnight operation in Tehran, targeting “dozens of military industrial sites for missile production” and the Spand nuclear R&D headquarters. According to the IDF, over 60 fighter jets struck around 120 targets using “precise intelligence guidance.”“These sites were built over years and were the industrial centre of gravity of the Iranian Ministry of Defence,” the IDF said, adding that it also struck a key facility used for producing raw materials for rocket engines.The Spand headquarters, founded in 2011 by Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, was also hit. The IDF described it as central to Iran’s nuclear weapons programme. During the same operation, four Iranian drones were intercepted.President Donald Trump has said he will decide “within two weeks” whether the US military will become directly involved in the conflict. His remarks, delivered by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, signal a short diplomatic window to avoid further escalation.Also read: Donald Trump to decide on Iran strike in 2 weeks; White House cites 'substantial' chance of negotiations to end conflict Trump said from the Oval Office, “I’m not looking to fight. But if it’s a choice between fighting and having a nuclear weapon, you have to do what you have to do.” He added, “I may do it, I may not do it. I mean, nobody knows what I’m going to do. Nothing is finished until it is finished. The next week is going to be very big — maybe less than a week.”His comments come amid reports that the US is considering striking Iran’s underground Fordo facility, which is heavily fortified and believed to be unreachable except by America’s “bunkerbuster” bombs.Israel's opening strikes last Friday reportedly killed several senior Iranian officials, including key figures in Iran's nuclear and military command. Among them was the intelligence chief of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), although Tehran has not officially confirmed his death.The strikes were aimed at Iran’s nuclear research hubs, ballistic missile sites, and facilities linked to the IRGC’s Quds Force. Israel’s strategy appears to be focused on decapitating Iran’s ability to launch retaliatory operations and to disrupt nuclear infrastructure, which it believes poses an existential threat.While the Israeli military has remained tightlipped on identities, analysts believe the loss of senior IRGC figures will have significant implications for Iran’s military coordination and may have triggered the intensity of its missile response.An Iranian missile that struck Soroka Medical Center in Beersheba, Israel, was rigged with a cluster munition warhead, according to Israel’s Home Front Command. This type of weapon carries dozens of submunitions that explode on impact, posing severe risks over a wide area.Also read: Hospital bombed, nuclear sites hit: Iran-Israel clash spirals; Netanyahu vows to make 'tyrants' pay The strike wounded at least 80 patients and medical staff. Although most injuries were minor, the hospital's infrastructure suffered heavy damage. Gas, water and airconditioning systems were all disrupted.Iran denied targeting the hospital, claiming the missile was aimed at a nearby Israeli military tech facility. An Israeli military official, speaking anonymously, admitted there was no specific intelligence suggesting Iran planned to hit the hospital.Israel’s hospitals, including Soroka, had preemptively moved vulnerable patients underground. This preparedness likely saved lives during the strike.Israel's defence minister, Israel Katz, directly blamed Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei for the missile strike on Soroka Medical Center. Katz said Israel’s military “has been instructed and knows that in order to achieve all of its goals, this man absolutely should not continue to exist.”Also read: Ayatollah Khamenei 'can no longer be allowed to exist,' warns Israel; seeks Iran Supreme Leader's accountability over hospital attack His statement was one of the most direct threats ever issued by an Israeli official against Iran’s top leader. While Israel has often accused Khamenei of orchestrating regional terrorism, such overt calls for his elimination are rare and risky.US officials later said President Trump had vetoed an Israeli plan to assassinate Khamenei. Trump confirmed there were “no plans to kill him, at least not for now.”The war of words has added fuel to an already explosive situation and underscores the deeply personal nature of the conflict's rhetoric.New satellite imagery has revealed a notable absence of visible US military aircraft at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, one of Washington’s most strategic sites in the region. The images, captured on Thursday, show that aircraft normally stationed at the base have either been relocated or concealed.While the US Department of Defense has not confirmed any repositioning, analysts say this could be part of a strategic redeployment to either prepare for a strike or to shield key assets from potential Iranian retaliation.Military watchers suggest the US may be trying to reduce its exposure ahead of Trump’s decision. Others believe assets may have been repositioned to naval platforms in the Persian Gulf, which are harder to detect and more flexible in combat operations.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faced fierce backlash after citing his son’s postponed wedding as a symbol of personal sacrifice during wartime. Standing in front of the missilestruck Soroka hospital, he said, “Each of us bears a personal cost, and my family has not been exempt.”Also read: 'Son's wedding cancelled for second time': Netanyahu shares 'personal cost' of war with Iran “This is the second time that my son Avner has cancelled a wedding due to missile threats. It is a personal cost for his fiancée as well, and I must say that my dear wife is a hero, and she bears a personal cost.”He continued: “It really reminds me of the British people during the blitz. We are going through a blitz.”While Netanyahu intended to strike a Churchillian tone, the remarks were ridiculed online, with critics accusing him of being emotionally detached from the actual suffering of citizens. With over 20 Israeli civilian deaths already reported, many found the analogy inappropriate.A diplomatic opening may be emerging, with Iran’s foreign minister Abbas Araghchi scheduled to meet EU and UK leaders in Geneva. British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said, “A window now exists within the next two weeks to achieve a diplomatic solution.” The meetings follow President Trump’s statement allowing a two-week pause before making a military decision. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas and representatives from France and Germany will also participate. The talks aim to halt escalation and revive negotiations around Iran’s nuclear capabilities.Also read: European FMs aim to meet Iran for nuclear talks Friday in Geneva With Iranian internet access restricted, information about the strikes and casualties has become increasingly difficult to verify. Israel had warned civilians in the city of Rasht to evacuate industrial zones ahead of targeted airstrikes. However, it's unclear how widely that warning was received. In Tehran and Isfahan, residents reported hearing anti-aircraft fire. The media blackout has complicated the international response and has limited humanitarian organisations’ ability to assess needs on the ground.While the current battle is between Israel and Iran, the implications stretch far beyond. Iran’s close ties to groups like Hezbollah and Hamas raise the risk of a multi-front war. The ongoing Gaza conflict, following Hamas’ attack in 2023, has already destabilised the region. Any miscalculation now—whether by airstrike or political move—could draw in additional players and ignite a broader Middle Eastern war. The coming days will likely prove critical in determining whether diplomacy can rein in the chaos—or whether the region is poised for deeper conflict.","A week into the war between Israel and Iran, tensions continue to rise as missile strikes, and drone attacks continue.

2 Air India Flights Cancelled, One Mumbai-Bound Plane Grounded In Kolkata Over Engine Snag





BENGALURU: A 36-year-old doctor was arrested on Tuesday after she created ruckus aboard an Air India Express flight from Bengaluru to Surat and allegedly threatened to crash the aircraft when cabin crew objected to her placing baggage in a restricted area near the crew cabin.The incident delayed the flight by two hours and led to a security scare. The accused, identified as Vyas Hiral Mohanbhai, from Shivanahalli near Yelahanka, was travelling alone on AI Flight IX2749 with two pieces of baggage.Also read: Air India cuts frequencies across North America, UK, EU, Far East & Australia 'at least' till July 15 According to police, the Ayurvedic doctor bypassed the check-in counter, insisting on carrying both bags on board. The situation escalated after Mohanbhai boarded the flight and left one of her bags near the crew cabin while taking the other to her seat, 20F.When the cabin crew asked her to keep the bag in the overhead compartment near her seat, she refused and insisted they keep it with them. Despite repeated requests by the crew and later the captain, Mohanbhai refused to comply and began abusing the staff.The confrontation soon involved fellow passengers, who also tried to reason with her, but she reportedly shouted at them. At one point, she allegedly threatened to crash the flight if the crew moved her baggage.With the situation spiralling, the captain alerted security and called CISF personnel, who boarded the aircraft and offloaded her.The incident took place between 2.45pm and 5.30pm, according to a complaint filed by Agnimitra Bahinipati, associate manager of security at KIA. Police said Mohanbhai did not stop there. Once taken to KIA police station, she continued to abuse and manhandle police officers, creating further disturbance. “This was the first time we heard such abusive language in the station,” a senior officer claimed.Her husband, who works in an educational institution in the city and hails from Odisha, appeared before police. He informed them that Mohanbhai had stopped practising medicine and was en route to Gujarat to visit her family.He reportedly told police she had created disturbances in public spaces in the past. Police are now verifying her background and previous incidents.","Vyas Hiral Mohanbhai, 36, was travelling alone on AI Flight IX2749 with two pieces of baggage.

BHUBANESWAR: PM Modi Friday said he had to say 'no' to US President Donald Trump's invitation to drop by in Washington on his way back from Canada, where he had gone for the G7 summit, as he did not want to miss his scheduled visit to the ""land of Lord Jagannath"", reports Ashok Pradhan.While Majhi's first anniversary as CM was on June 12, the Odisha govt timed the main celebration on Friday in sync with the PM's schedule. Any change in plan could have put the govt in an awkward position in a state where BJP swept the Lok Sabha polls, winning 20 of the 21 seats, and stormed into office by winning 78 of the 147 assembly seats.Speaking at a rally in Bhubaneswar to mark one year of Mohan Charan Majhi-led BJP govt in Odisha, PM Modi said, ""The President of United States called me, saying, 'Since you are in Canada, please come over. We will have a meal together and talk.' I thanked him and politely declined, saying that visiting the land of Mahaprabhu (Lord Jagannath) was essential for me. The devotion for Mahaprabhu and your love drew me here.""In what was Modi's sixth visit to the state in the past one year, the PM praised Odisha's progress under the BJP govt, emphasising the state's role in India's cultural and economic development. He highlighted initiatives aimed at improving infrastructure, healthcare, and economic opportunities for the people of Odisha, particularly tribal communities.Attacking the previous Congress regimes, the PM said the party which governed India for decades had neglected the tribal community and ""used them merely for political benefits"".He said over 125 tribal-dominated districts were affected by Maoists for years. ""Most of these districts were declared backward, and the then govts did not take the responsibility to develop them,"" Modi said. In contrast, the BJP-led govt freed tribal society from Naxal violence, ushering in development in these areas.The PM also highlighted the role of eastern India in the country's growth trajectory. ""The development of 21st century India will gain momentum from eastern India. This is the era of Purvodaya.""","PM Modi said he had to say 'no' to US President Donald Trump's invitation to drop by in Washington on his way back from Canada.

PURULIA: Nine people, including two brothers, returning from a wedding died when the SUV carrying them collided head-on with a truck on Dhanbad-Jamshedpur stretch of NH-18 in West Bengal's Purulia early Friday. All victims were from Jharkhand, reports Tanuja Singh Deo.The group had hired an SUV from Nimdih village in Jharkhand's Seraikela-Kharsawan to attend a wedding in Purulia's Adabana village. When the guests were heading back home the next morning, their vehicle crashed into an oncoming truck at a curve.The impact of the collision left the SUV mangled, while the truck overturned onto the roadside. Witnesses said the front of the SUV had caved in completely, trapping the passengers within.Balrampur police took the passengers to Banshgar rural health centre, where all nine were declared dead.

IMPHAL: An indefinite shutdown was observed Friday in Manipur's Churachandpur and a 24-hour closure in Kangpokpi over the death of a tribal woman in crossfire the previous day between security forces and unidentified gunmen. Committee on Tribal Unity (CoTU) called the shutdowns, supported by civil society organisations in both districts. Deceased Hoikholhing Haokip was the wife of a village chief in Churachandpur, Manipur's tribal heartland.Forces launched an operation after a farmer, Ningthoujam Biren Singh, suffered a bullet injury in his arm in alleged shooting by unidentified gunmen while working in his paddy field on Thursday. The gunmen later opened fire on the forces, prompting a retaliation and the crossfire. Haokip was later found dead with a bullet wound. A hunt is on for the gunmen.CoTU described the attacks and death as ""another targeted assault in a systematic campaign"" and held state govt responsible for allowing such atrocities to unfold under its watch. Manipur has been under President's rule since this Feb. CoTU alleged that Meitei aggressors were being allowed to act unchecked and that failure to protect vulnerable populations had once again led to loss of life. CoTU also demanded immediate action against those responsible for the killing.Kuki Women Organisation for Human Rights also condemned the killing of Haokip, calling it a horrific act of violence.","Hoikholhing Haokip was the wife of a village chief in Churachandpur, Manipur's tribal heartland.

An Israeli military official on Thursday said it was a “mistake” for a spokesperson to claim earlier that Israel had struck the Bushehr nuclear facility in Iran, reported Reuters.The official confirmed attacks on Iran’s Natanz, Isfahan, and Arak nuclear sites but declined to confirm or deny any strike on Bushehr.The clarification comes after an Israeli military spokesperson initially said that Israel had targeted Bushehr, along with other nuclear facilities. However, the scale of any potential attack on Bushehr remains unclear.Bushehr, located on Iran’s Gulf coast, is the country’s only operational nuclear power plant. It uses Russian fuel, which is returned to Russia once spent to limit proliferation risks. Due to its location and function, any strike on Bushehr carries potential environmental risks, including air and water contamination — a major concern for neighbouring Gulf states.A source familiar with the matter told Reuters that Gulf nations, in coordination with the UN nuclear watchdog, have prepared contingency plans in case of an attack on any nuclear facility in the region.Earlier Thursday, the Russian embassy in Iran stated that the Bushehr plant was operating normally and that no security threat had been observed.Concerns about regional fallout from any strike on Iranian nuclear facilities have long been voiced. In March, Qatar’s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani warned that such an attack could “entirely contaminate” Gulf waters, posing severe risks to Qatar, the UAE, and Kuwait.“These countries have no water, no fish, nothing ... no life,” he warned, referencing their reliance on desalinated water from the Gulf for over 18 million people.","An Israeli military official on Thursday said it was a “mistake” for a spokesperson to claim earlier that Israel had struck the Bushehr nuclear facility in Iran.

Israel-Iran conflict: Israel uses 'Barak' defence system to intercept Iranian drones,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israel-iran-conflict-israel-uses-barak-defence-system-to-intercept-iranian-drones-video/articleshow/121978485.cms,"Iran Fires 20+ Ballistic Missiles At Israel In Latest Barrage; Impacts In Haifa, Over A Dozen Hurt





The Israeli Air Force deployed its advanced “Barak” air defence system to intercept an unmanned aerial vehicle that entered Israeli airspace, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said in a post on X on Friday.The interception marks the system’s first operational use within the Air Force’s aerial defence framework.Developed indigenously, the “Barak” system is designed to safeguard against aerial threats, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), cruise missiles, and other airborne attacks. “The Air Force will continue to operate to intercept targets that threaten the skies of the State of Israel and the maintenance of air superiority in the region,” the IDF said.Earlier this week, the Israeli Navy revealed that it had used the naval variant, the “Barak Magen” system, for the first time in combat.According to the IDF, eight drones launched by Iran were intercepted overnight by naval forces using the system aboard a Sa’ar 6-class Corvette.The navy noted that since the start of hostilities with Iran last Friday, approximately 25 drones targeting Israel have been intercepted at sea.The Barak Magen system, developed by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), represents a significant advancement in Israel’s maritime defence, particularly against drone swarms and precision-guided weapons.Equipped with the EL/M-2248 MF-STAR radar and capable of long-range interception of over 150 km using LRAD interceptor missiles, the system offers 360-degree threat detection and rapid-response engagement. Designed for use in maritime environments, it is now operational aboard agile Sa’ar 6-class warships that safeguard Israel’s offshore assets, including its exclusive economic zone and gas platforms.Unlike land-based air defence systems such as Iron Dome or David’s Sling, Barak Magen focuses on naval operations, reflecting Israel’s evolving military doctrine that places growing importance on maritime air superiority amid rising regional threats.","The Israeli Air Force deployed its advanced “Barak” air defence system to intercept an unmanned aerial vehicle that entered Israeli airspace.

From Tehran to Baghdad: Thousands Across Middle East March Against Israel's Attacks On Iran

“China may be offering economic relief and rhetorical support to Iran, but actual military intervention is not anywhere near the table yet,” Wen-Ti Sung, nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub, told Bloomberg.

Why it matters

1. China’s support for Iran is driven more by economic self-interest and strategic restraint than ideological alignment.

2. Beijing’s Middle East strategy is transactional and risk-averse, prioritizing energy security and economic ties over alliances.

Between the lines: Rhetoric without risk

Zoom in

Oil calculus: Over 90% of Iran’s oil exports go to China, mostly via sanction-evading methods using yuan and shadow fleets.

Yet Iran accounts for less than 1% of China’s total trade. It’s significant for Tehran, not Beijing.

“If Iranian oil disappears, China has other options,” noted Fitch Ratings. “OPEC+ spare capacity could fill the gap.” Beijing’s diversified energy strategy is designed precisely for this scenario-an unstable supplier becomes expendable.

Energy risk: If the conflict disrupts the Strait of Hormuz, the fallout for China could be massive. Nearly half of its crude oil passes through the narrow waterway.

Weapon supply: Iran needs advanced air defense and fighter jets to match Israel. But China has not signed a new arms deal with Iran since 2005. US sanctions have disincentivized such transactions.

Public mood: Some Chinese nationalist voices want Beijing to back Iran militarily. But most state messaging focuses on stability, and social media commentary is mixed.

“If Islamic countries such as Pakistan intervene, it will indirectly drag China in, because the weapons they use are from China,” Pan Guang of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences told the South China Morning Post.

The big picture

What they’re saying

“Xi has expressed willingness to help. But what can he or China do?” asked Zhiqun Zhu, professor at Bucknell University. “Mediating is a tall order that’s hard to reach without cooperation of other key players, especially the United States.”

“Further escalation of tensions in the Middle East is not in the interests of any party,” said China’s foreign ministry, urging countries with “special influence on Israel” - a nod to the US - to play a constructive role.

“If Trump takes some action on the Israel-Iran issue, he can divert attention from other troublesome issues,” said Pan Guang, implying that China sees US threats as partly political theater.

What’s next

But don’t expect Beijing to:

Sell weapons to Tehran

Mediate alone between Israel and Iran

The bottom line





As Israel rains missiles on Iranian military and nuclear targets and President Donald Trump weighs direct US intervention with bunker-busting bombs, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei finds himself increasingly isolated. But the one power many hoped - or feared - might come to Tehran’s aid, China, has stayed conspicuously cautious.Not that China has totally abandoned Iran, it has drawn a red line: But only on paper. Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi called the Israeli strikes on Iran “unacceptable.” President Xi Jinping issued a condemnation through the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. China even offered rhetorical support for Iran’s “sovereignty and security.” But beyond the statements, one thing was conspicuously absent: Action.Chinese President Xi Jinping has condemned Israel’s assault, emphasized dialogue, and backed Iran’s sovereignty. Yet he has shown no signs of rushing to deliver weapons, military intelligence, or any other support that might change the battlefield calculus in Iran’s favor.Iran is facing its most serious external threat since the 1979 revolution. Israel has killed over 600 Iranians, including top generals and nuclear scientists. Trump has demanded Iran’s “unconditional surrender” and is weighing military options. And yet, China - a supposed strategic partner - has stuck to statements and sidestepped commitments.The lack of meaningful action from Beijing signals two crucial realities:Beijing’s pattern is clear. As in Ukraine, it prefers moral positioning to material involvement. “China may be offering economic relief and rhetorical support to Iran, but actual military intervention is not anywhere near the table yet,” Wen-Ti Sung, a nonresident fellow with the Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub, told Bloomberg.The calculus is both ideological and pragmatic. Xi’s doctrine of non-interference-rooted in Deng-era realism-has become a trademark of China’s global posture. That principle allows Beijing to project neutrality in foreign conflicts, appeal to the Global South, and avoid the pitfalls of overextension that have ensnared the US for decades.In this case, the risks are exceptionally high. Iran is being directly targeted not just by Israel but potentially by an emboldened United States. President Donald Trump has floated the possibility of using “bunker buster” bombs to strike Iran’s deeply buried nuclear sites. Open conflict with a US-backed adversary in the Middle East is a trap China has no interest in walking into.“China does not want to risk getting entrapped by Iran’s war with an Israel that has the Trump administration behind it,” Sung explained.China and Iran have deepened ties in recent years. Xi oversaw Iran’s entry into BRICS and the SCO. They signed a 25-year strategic deal in 2021, reportedly worth $400 billion in investments. But implementation has been slow, and sanctions have chilled enthusiasm among Chinese firms.Iran is a “strategic partner” for Beijing only insofar as it fits broader geopolitical aims - challenging US dominance, securing oil, and building influence. Iran is not central to China's Middle East blueprint.Meanwhile, China has kept relations warm with Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. When Beijing brokered a diplomatic thaw between Tehran and Riyadh in 2023, it celebrated the moment but quickly stepped back as new conflicts erupted.“China’s strategy in the Middle East is to stay on good terms with everyone to maximize its economic gains and geopolitical influence,” Neil Thomas of the Asia Society Policy Institute told the Bloomberg.And if conflict between the US and Iran escalates, Beijing may even benefit. Greater US involvement in the Middle East would “distract Washington from strategic competition with China,” Bloomberg analysts noted.If the conflict deepens and Trump orders US strikes, China will likely double down on diplomacy, perhaps via the UN Security Council, where it can flex soft power without real costs.Deploy military assetsThat’s not how Xi operates. China has neither the appetite nor the leverage to act as a wartime ally. And with global oil prices, Chinese economic recovery, and domestic woes in play - including youth unemployment and a real estate slump - the risks of deeper entanglement far outweigh the potential gains.Xi Jinping is not coming to the Ayatollah’s rescue. China may speak out against Israeli strikes and back Iran in the abstract. But when it comes to real power - arms, troops, strategic shielding - Tehran is on its own.Xi’s priority remains crystal clear: avoid chaos, avoid sanctions, and avoid war.(With inputs from agencies)","Beijing’s Middle East strategy is transactional and risk-averse, prioritizing energy security and economic ties over alliances.

'Cried for an hour after funeral': Raj Kushwaha's family claims he's innocent in Meghalaya murder case

(With inputs from PTI)





INDORE: The grandmother of accused Raj Kushwaha has died in Uttar Pradesh's Fatehpur district following a heart attack.According to family members, Ramlali had gone into deep shock ever since Raj was arrested for the murder of Indore's Raja Raghuvanshi in Meghalaya.Family sources say she had stopped eating and remained withdrawn for days. Late Tuesday night, she suffered a heart attack and died.Ram Lalli, 74, died at her residence in Rampur village of Gazipur, located in Uttar Pradesh’s Fatehpur district. Her husband, Darbari Singh, told reporters that she had been deeply distressed since Raj’s name emerged as the key conspirator in the case.""She was constantly defending her grandson, insisting he was innocent and being framed,"" Singh said, adding that the allegations weighed heavily on her.Just a week ago, Ram Lalli had spoken to the media in support of her grandson. ""Raj never had an affair with anyone. Sonam got her husband killed and is dragging Raj into this,"" she had said. She had also alleged that powerful people were involved in the case and “they can do anything.”Singh recalled Raj as a quiet, responsible young man who had been supporting his family ever since his father died during the Covid pandemic.The family had moved to Indore around 15 years ago amid financial hardship, with Raj joining them about a decade later along with his mother and two sisters, once their situation stabilised.Raj, a Class 12 pass-out, worked as an accountant at a furniture sheet manufacturing unit owned by Sonam Raghuvanshi’s family in Indore's Govind Nagar Kharcha area.Police have so far refused to comment on the development, citing that the case is being handled by authorities in another state.Raja Raghuvanshi had married Sonam on May 11 and the couple left for their honeymoon in Meghalaya on May 20. Just three days later, Raja went missing. His mutilated body was found on June 2 in a gorge near a waterfall in Sohra, East Khasi Hills.Sonam surrendered to police in Uttar Pradesh’s Ghazipur district on June 8. Raj Kushwaha and others accused were picked up from various parts of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.According to investigators, Sonam allegedly orchestrated her husband’s murder, with Raj and three of his childhood friends helping to execute the plan.""No, not our boy..."" — the words echo through a cramped 200sqft room in Indore’s Shankar Nagar, where the family of 21-year-old Raj Kushwaha has shut themselves away in disbelief. Raj was arrested for allegedly conspiring with Sonam Raghuvanshi to murder her husband Raja during their honeymoon in Meghalaya.Since the arrest, the family has been in a state of shock. Raj’s 15-year-old sister reportedly faints every time a police siren passes by. Neighbours have stopped speaking to them. The family is reeling from the accusation that Raj, who worked in billing for Sonam's family business, was not only her lover but also allegedly orchestrated Raja’s murder with the help of three childhood friends.Police said Raj stayed close to both families in the aftermath of the incident, even attending Raja’s funeral and supporting Sonam’s father. ""He cried for an hour after coming from the funeral,"" said his mother, 52-year-old Chunni Bai. ""He said he'd have died if he had seen Raja's body.""But things changed quickly. Hours after the cremation last Sunday, Raj changed clothes and left, telling his family he was going to co-accused Vishal’s house. Then came silence — his phone was switched off. He was later picked up by police from Vishal’s home.","Ram Lalli, 74, died at her residence in Rampur village of Gazipur, located in Uttar Pradesh’s Fatehpur district.

While ruling out direct involvement, he hinted at indirect assistance.“Collusion in terms of equipment, supplies, helping them out in various ways, perhaps with satellite imagery as well — all that could have happened, but definitely they did not take any active role,” Singh said.“Trust is low… Pakistanis don't have many resources, so they will do all this begging, borrowing, etc., to get equipment from wherever they can, whether it is Turkey or China.

When informed it was Gabbard who made that statement, he added: ""She's wrong.""The remarks came as tensions continue to rise in the Middle East, with Iran under pressure from the US and its allies over its expanding nuclear activities.Earlier in March, Gabbard told lawmakers that US intelligence agencies believed Iran had ""not made a decision to build a nuclear weapon.""Trump also weighed in on Iran’s nuclear energy claims, saying it was “hard to see” why Iran would need civilian-use nuclear power when it has “one of the largest oil reserves in the world.”Trump said the US should not be required to meet Nato's proposed defense spending target, ahead of an upcoming alliance meeting.Nato members are expected to discuss a pledge for each country to spend 5% of its GDP on defense, but Trump told reporters, “I don’t think we should, but I think they should,” referring to other member nations.“We’ve been supporting Nato so long,” he said, criticizing Spain for rejecting the pledge and calling it a “very low payer.”“They were either good negotiators, or they weren’t doing the right thing,” Trump said in northern New Jersey, where he is spending part of the weekend. “I think Spain has to pay what everybody else has to pay.” he added.Trump also questioned Iran’s need for a civilian nuclear energy program, saying, ""They’re sitting on top of one of the largest piles of oil in the world.

US vice president JD Vance sparked outrage on Friday during a tense visit to Los Angeles, where he accused California governor Gavin Newsom and LA Mayor Karen Bass of encouraging violent immigration protests and mistakenly referred to Senator Alex Padilla as “Jose Padilla,” a name associated with a convicted al-Qaida plotter.Vance’s visit came after days of violent clashes between police and protesters, following federal immigration raids across Southern California. The Trump administration’s decision to send in 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines has been heavily criticised by state and local leaders, who accuse the White House of escalating tensions rather than calming them.Speaking to reporters after touring a federal Joint Operations Center and mobile command centre, Vance doubled down on blaming California officials. “Gavin Newsom and Karen Bass, by treating the city as a sanctuary city, have basically said that this is open season on federal law enforcement,” he said.“What happened here was a tragedy,” Vance continued. “You had people who were doing the simple job of enforcing the law and they had rioters egged on by the governor and the mayor, making it harder for them to do their job. That is disgraceful. And it is why the president has responded so forcefully.”Vance also referred to Democratic Senator Alex Padilla as “Jose Padilla,” a week after the senator was tackled and handcuffed while speaking at a news conference hosted by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem . “I was hoping Jose Padilla would be here to ask a question,” Vance said. “I guess he decided not to show up because there wasn't a theatre. And that's all it is.”Critics were quick to call out the remark, noting that “Jose Padilla” is the name of a man convicted of terrorism-related charges during the Bush administration. Governor Newsom responded on X, saying the name mix-up was “no accident.”Governor Newsom fired back during a press conference, accusing Vance of spreading “utter nonsense.” He denied claims that state officials encouraged violence, saying, “The Vice President's claim is categorically false. The governor has consistently condemned violence and has made his stance clear.”Mayor Karen Bass also condemned the comment. “How dare you say that city officials encourage violence? We kept the peace,” she said, calling the federal operation a “stunt” that wasted hundreds of millions of dollars.Earlier that day, Newsom had urged Vance to meet with victims of January’s deadly wildfires while in California and to speak with US President Donald Trump about unlocking $40 billion in federal wildfire aid. “I hope we get that back on track,” Newsom posted on X. “We are counting on you, Mr Vice President.” Vance did not respond to those remarks during his Friday appearance.","US vice president JD Vance sparked outrage on Friday during a tense visit to Los Angeles.

Will Israel go it alone?



Are nukes on the table?

What is the Fordow facility?







To achieve its stated objective of dismantling Iran's nuclear programme, Israel must neutralise the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant, a critical and highly fortified Iranian nuclear facility. But Israel's own arsenal lacks the conventional ordnance capable of destroying Fordow.Despite recent Israeli airstrikes targeting Fordow, the facility remains operational and undamaged due to its underground location and robust defenses, including surface-to-air missile systems deployed by Iran and Russia.Instead, the destruction of the facility will require multiple strikes using the US GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP), a 30,000-pound bunker-buster bomb delivered by US B-2 stealth bombers.A report by The Guardian claimed that the US military has reservations regarding the success of using a bunker-buster bomb. Two defense officials were reportedly briefed that only a tactical nuclear weapon could reach the facility.President Donald Trump has been briefed extensively on the risks and benefits of attacking Fordow, recognising that disabling this facility is essential to prevent Iran from producing nuclear weapons in a short timeframe.Also read: Donald Trump to decide on Iran strike in 2 weeks; White House cites 'substantial' chance of negotiations to end conflict However, he has not made a final decision on whether to join Israel's ongoing air campaign against Iran's nuclear sites, opting instead to wait up to two weeks to see if diplomatic negotiations with Tehran might succeed in halting Iran's nuclear program.But if in two weeks, Trump decides to back out from launching a strike, Israel may have only one way of destroying the facility -- going nuclear.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has made it clear that Israel will not wait for US approval or a ""green light"" to continue its campaign against Iran's nuclear facilities.In a rare Hebrew-language interview, Netanyahu declared that Israel is fully committed to hitting all Iranian nuclear sites, including Fordow, and asserted that Israel has the capability to do so independently.If President Trump ultimately decides not to join Israel in military strikes against Iran within the next two weeks, it is plausible that Tel Aviv might escalate its tacticsThe possibility that Israel might resort to using a low-yield nuclear weapon to destroy the Fordow facility has been a topic of speculation, given the difficulty of striking such a deeply buried site with conventional weapons.While Netanyahu has not explicitly confirmed the use of nuclear weapons, his statements about Israel's capability to destroy all nuclear sites suggest a readiness to deploy advanced and potentially extreme measures if necessary.Heather Williams, director of the Project on Nuclear Issues and a senior fellow in the Defense and Security Department at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, has said that while Israel might not have the conventional ordnance to destroy Fordow, it is believed to have the nuclear capability to do so.""Numerous Israeli leaders, including PM Yitzhak Rabin in 1987, have stated that Israel will not be the first to introduce nuclear weapons to the region, which Netanyahu has repeated. But if Israel did have low-yield nuclear weapons, these could deliver the necessary firepower to destroy Fordow. For example, the US GBU-57 has a yield of approximately the equivalent of 2 tons of TNT; whereas the lowest yield nuclear weapon was the US Davy Crockett, which had a yield of approximately 10 tons. ""Williams further said that mere strong hint by Israel that it is considering using a nuke to take out the Fordow facility might be enough to coerce Iran to back down and return to negotiations.Fordow is located near Qom, about 30 kilometers northeast of the city, and is built deep inside a mountain, estimated to be 80 to 90 meters underground. This depth and the facility’s hardened construction make it resistant to conventional aerial attacks and most bunker-buster bombs currently available to Israel.Also read: Why Iran’s Fordow nuclear site is critical; how could Israel try to take it out? The Fordow facility spans approximately 54,000 square feet and houses around 3,000 centrifuges.It is unique in Iran’s nuclear infrastructure as the only site where uranium particles enriched to near weapons-grade levels have been detected by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Iran has enriched uranium there up to 60 percent, with reports of uranium enriched as high as 83.7 percent, which is close to weapons-grade purity.","Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant is a critical and highly fortified Iranian nuclear facility.

Israel ASSASSINATES Another Nuclear Scientist In Drone Strike As Iranian Missiles Hit Israeli Cities





Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday said he was worried when asked whether he feared the world was moving towards a potential World War III, reported news agency Reuters.Speaking at an economic forum in St. Petersburg, Putin noted that global conflict risks were increasing.He pointed to Russia’s own war in Ukraine and the ongoing tensions between Israel and Iran. Putin also raised concerns about developments around nuclear facilities in Iran, where Russian specialists are currently constructing two new nuclear reactors for Tehran.""It is disturbing. I am speaking without any irony, without any jokes. Of course, there is a lot of conflict potential, it is growing, and it is right under our noses, and it affects us directly,"" said Putin.He added, ""And this requires, of course, not only our careful attention to the events taking place, but also the search for solutions, the search for solutions, preferably by peaceful means, in all directions.""Putin also said that Russia plans to expand military and technical cooperation with ""friendly countries"" by jointly producing weapons and training military personnel.The Russian President said Moscow aimed to modernise its own armed forces by equipping them with the latest weapons and technology.""We will harness new technology to improve the combat capabilities of the Russian armed forces, modernise military infrastructure facilities, (and) equip them with the latest technology and weapons and equipment,"" he said.Putin emphasised that Russia’s cooperation with friendly nations would go beyond arms supplies or equipment upgrades.""At the same time, we intend to develop military-technical co-operation with friendly countries. And we are talking not only about supplies or the modernisation of equipment and weapons, but also about joint development, personnel training, and the creation of turn-key enterprises and production facilities,"" he said, according to Reuters.On the economic front, Putin said Russia planned to strengthen trade ties with its partners by removing barriers, opening new market opportunities, and deepening investment cooperation.Putin has already offered to mediate between Iran and Israel amid escalating tensions in the Middle East. He claimed that Moscow’s longstanding ties with both countries make it uniquely positioned to help broker peace.“We are not imposing anything on anyone; we are simply talking about how we see a possible way out of the situation,” he said.“But the decision, of course, is up to the political leadership of all these countries, primarily Iran and Israel.” Putin acknowledged the complexity of the crisis, saying “it’s a delicate issue,” but said that a solution to the conflict is possible.“In my view, a solution could be found,"" the Russian president said. His comments come at a time of growing concern that Israeli strikes on Iranian targets and the potential for a wider war could draw in other regional and global powers.","Russian President Vladimir Putin said he feared the world was moving towards a potential World War III.

NEW DELHI: In a shocking incident, a woman's body was discovered buried in front of her residence, allegedly killed by her in-laws who concealed the crime for nearly two months by filing a missing person report. The victim, Tannu Kumar from Shikohabad in Firozabad district, Uttar Pradesh , was married to Arun Singh from Roshan Nagar two years ago.The victim's father, Hakim, claimed that despite his suspicions about a freshly covered pit observed during his visit to his brother-in-law's residence, the police initially dismissed his concerns.Four family members have been charged at Palla Police Station: Bhoop Singh (from UP's Mainpuri), his wife Sonia, son Arun Singh, and daughter Kajal. Sources indicate that Bhoop Singh and Arun Singh are currently under police interrogation.Police investigations reveal that on April 23, Arun Singh and his father arranged for an earthmover to dig a 10-foot deep pit outside their house. The following day, they had a mason fill it. Subsequently, they reported Tannu as missing, describing her as mentally challenged.Hakim stated that his daughter endured dowry-related harassment, forcing her to stay at her parents' home for a year post-marriage.Despite a panchayat's intervention facilitating her return to Faridabad, the issues persisted.Upon learning of his daughter's disappearance, Hakim visited Bhoop Singh's residence with his other daughter, Preeti, where he noticed the suspicious pit. Despite multiple visits to the local police station, his pleas for investigation were ignored until recently.The authorities excavated the pit on Friday morning in the presence of Naib Tehsildar Jaswant Singh, recovering Tannu's remains. A Faridabad Police spokesperson confirmed ongoing raids to apprehend the remaining family members. Following a post-mortem at Badshah Khan Civil Hospital, the body was released to the family.","Tannu Kumar from Shikohabad in Firozabad district, Uttar Pradesh, was married to Arun Singh from Roshan Nagar two years ago.

Columbia student Mahmoud Khalil case: Federal judge orders release of pro-Palestinian activist; freed after three months in detention,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/columbia-student-mahmoud-khalil-case-federal-judge-orders-release-of-pro-palestinian-activist-freed-after-three-months-in-detention/articleshow/121981094.cms,"



A federal judge on Friday ordered the release of Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia University graduate student, from immigration detention after spending more than three months in custody.Khalil was detained in early March as the Trump administration sought to deport him over his alleged involvement in pro-Palestinian protests on campus.The decision was announced by US District Judge Michael Farbiarz in New Jersey, following a request from Khalil's legal team to grant him bail or relocate him from Louisiana to New Jersey to be near his wife and newborn child, according to the Associated Press.Khalil's arrest marked the first under Trump's initiative against students involved in campus protests regarding Israel's military actions in Gaza. His prominent role in Columbia's pro-Palestinian demonstrations last year led to protests in New York and Washington, DC.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has advocated for Khalil's expulsion, saying Khalil’s activism poses “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.”Judge Farbiarz had previously ruled that the government could not continue detaining Mahmoud Khalil based on his role in pro-Palestinian protests.However, officials later argued that Khalil, a legal US resident, was being held for allegedly providing false information on his green card application — a claim Khalil firmly denies.Khalil was arrested on March 8 at his Manhattan apartment in connection with his participation in the campus demonstrations.Khalil says he did nothing wrong and did not hide anything on his green card application. He told the court he only did a university-approved internship with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, and was not an officer, as the government claims.Khalil was not arrested during the Columbia protests and has not been accused of any crimes. His public presence at the demonstrations drew attention from critics and the White House, which accused him of “siding with terrorists” without providing evidence.","US District Judge Michael Farbiarz in New Jersey ordered the release of Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia University graduate student.

Pakistan has nominated US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize , crediting his ""decisive diplomatic intervention and pivotal leadership"" during the recent crisis between India and Pakistan.The announcement was made in a post on social media platform X, where Pakistani officials said Trump played a key role in defusing tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.The nomination follows comments made by Trump on Friday, in which he argued he deserved the prestigious award for multiple peace efforts, including his involvement in easing tensions between India and Pakistan. “I should have gotten it four or five times,” the president said. “They won't give me a Nobel Peace Prize because they only give it to liberals.”While the Indian government has rejected the idea that Trump played a role in the ceasefire, Trump insists he helped prevent a potential war. “Well, I stopped a war... I love Pakistan. I think Modi is a fantastic man. I spoke to him last night. We're going to make a trade deal with Modi of India,” he told reporters earlier this week. “But I stopped the war between Pakistan and India.This man was extremely influential in stopping it from the Pakistan side. Modi from the India side and others. They were going at it – and they're both nuclear countries. I got it stopped.”Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff, General Asim Munir, has also secured a lunch meeting at the White House following his recommendation that US President Donald Trump be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 2026. White House spokesperson Anna Kelly confirmed the meeting will take place but did not provide a date.This is not the first time Trump has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. In the past, loyal lawmakers and supporters have submitted his name for consideration. He has also repeatedly voiced frustration at being overlooked, referencing the 2009 win of former US President Barack Obama.Trump also announced on Truth Social that he had arranged a peace treaty between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda. He said officials from both countries would travel to Washington on Monday to sign the agreement, although their joint statement listed the date as June 27.“This is a Great Day for Africa and, quite frankly, a Great Day for the World!” Trump wrote. He also criticised the Nobel committee for not acknowledging his previous peace efforts in other regions. “I won’t get a Nobel Peace Prize for this, I won’t get a Nobel Peace Prize for stopping the War between India and Pakistan, I won’t get a Nobel Peace Prize for stopping the War between Serbia and Kosovo, I won’t get a Nobel Peace Prize for keeping Peace between Egypt and Ethiopia. ..

(With inputs from Associated Press)





A federal judge in Boston on Friday temporarily halted the Trump administration's move to strip Harvard University of its ability to enrol international students, handing the Ivy League school a key win as it fights back against a series of federal sanctions and tensions with the White House.Judge Allison Burroughs' decision ensures Harvard can continue hosting international students whilst the legal proceedings continue.In May, Harvard initiated legal action against the Department of Homeland Security following the agency's decision to revoke the university's authorisation to host foreign students and issue visa documentation.This decision would have affected approximately 7,000 international students, representing 25% of Harvard's student population, forcing them to transfer or face illegal status in the US. Additionally, new overseas students would have been prevented from attending Harvard.The university contended that this was unlawful retaliation for refusing White House demands regarding changes to campus protest policies, admissions procedures, recruitment practices and other matters. Burroughs promptly suspended the action following Harvard's lawsuit.In early June, Trump attempted another restriction on foreign students entering the US to study at Harvard, citing different legal grounds.Harvard contested this decision, and Burroughs again temporarily blocked the implementation.The ongoing legal proceedings have created uncertainty among current students, whilst prospective international students worldwide remain uncertain about their ability to attend America's most established and financially robust university.According to Harvard's court documentation, the Trump administration's attempts to prevent international student enrolment have generated ""profound fear, concern, and confusion"". Harvard's immigration services director, Maureen Martin, reported numerous international students enquiring about transfer options.The relationship between Trump and Harvard has been strained for months following the university's rejection of government demands aimed at addressing conservative criticisms about the institution's perceived liberal stance and alleged tolerance of anti-Jewish harassment.The administration has reduced research funding by over $2.6 billion, terminated federal contracts and threatened the university's tax-exempt status.Earlier in April, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem ordered Harvard University to hand over extensive records on any potentially illegal or dangerous activity by foreign students.Although Harvard said it complied, Noem claimed the response was inadequate and, on May 22, revoked the university’s certification under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program.Harvard filed a lawsuit in response, arguing that the decision severely harmed its global standing and ability to attract top international talent. “Without its international students, Harvard is not Harvard,” the lawsuit stated, warning that the sanction would particularly disrupt graduate programs that rely heavily on foreign enrollment.",A federal judge in Boston on Friday temporarily halted the Trump administration's move to strip Harvard University of its ability to enrol international students.

'No talks until Israeli aggression stops': Iran rejects nuclear dialogue with US after Trump sets deadline; Europe pushes to revive diplomacy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-talks-until-israeli-aggression-stops-iran-rejects-nuclear-dialogue-with-us-after-trump-sets-deadline-europe-pushes-to-revive-diplomacy/articleshow/121978605.cms,"Iran Hits Haifa; Powerful Missile Strike Caught On Cam As Air Defences Fail To Stop Missiles

Iran Rejects Talks, Shuts Down All Negotiations Amid Israel Strikes: FM Abbas Araghchi





Iran has firmly ruled out any negotiations over its nuclear programme while under attack by Israel, rejecting repeated outreach efforts from the United States, after President Donald Trump gave a two-week deadline for possible dialogue.Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on Friday that talks with Washington were off the table “until Israeli aggression stops.”“Americans want to negotiate and have sent messages several times, but we clearly said that as long as this aggression doesn’t stop, there’s no place for talk of dialogue,” he said in an address on state television,” Araqchi stated on state television.He also accused the United States of being complicit, calling it a “partner to Israeli crime against Iran.”The remarks come just a day after Trump said he would decide “within the next two weeks” whether to join Israel in striking Iran.“Based on the fact that there’s a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take place with Iran in the near future, I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks,” Trump said in a statement.Despite Tehran’s public refusal to talk, Araqchi later arrived in Geneva for discussions with European foreign ministers.The meeting involving representatives from France, Germany, the UK, and the EU’s foreign policy chief, is part of Europe’s effort to bring Iran back to the negotiating table and avoid further escalation over its nuclear programme.Ahead of the meeting, diplomats said Araqchi would be told that the U.S. remains open to direct negotiations. However, hopes for a breakthrough remain low, as per diplomats.According to a senior Iranian official quoted by Reuters, Iran is willing to discuss limits on uranium enrichment, but will not accept a complete ban, ""especially now under Israel's strikes"".Meanwhile, the conflict between Iran and Israel has entered its second week. Israel claimed it struck dozens of targets overnight, including missile factories, military facilities, and a research centre linked to nuclear weapons development in Tehran.Iran launched missiles towards Beersheba early on Friday, with Israeli media reporting subsequent missile impacts in Tel Aviv, the Negev and Haifa following later attacks.An Israeli military representative confirmed approximately 20 missiles were launched in recent strikes. Israeli emergency services reported at least two people injured in the latest wave of attacks.Israel launched its assault on Iran last Friday, citing concerns that Tehran was close to acquiring nuclear weapons. Iran, insisting its nuclear programme is peaceful, responded with a series of missile and drone attacks on Israeli targets.",Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on Friday that talks with Washington were off the table “until Israeli aggression stops” The remarks come just a day after Trump said he would decide “within the next two weeks” whether to join Israel in striking Iran.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121978742,imgsize-940732,width-400,resizemode-4/121978742.jpg"

A 44-year-old Florida man lands into trouble after sneaking into a random house. He stayed there for several days to avoid going home to his angry wife after an argument, according to officials.The man, who identified himself as Joe, was cooking dinner and had just run a luxurious bath when police arrived, the NY Post reported.A neighbour in Davenport, who had been asked to watch the house while its owner was away, called Polk County sheriff’s deputies on June 9 after noticing suspicious activity, according to a department release.Joe explained his actions by saying he had fought with his wife four days earlier and broke into the house to avoid going home and facing her anger.“The homeowner wasn’t going to be around for a while, so he asked his neighbour to bear the responsibility of watching over the house. That neighbour did a fantastic job too,” the sheriff’s office wrote on Facebook.“One night, the neighbour saw lights going on and off within the house, so he called the homeowner, who in turn contacted the Polk County sheriff office.

JD Vance—standing in lockstep with Trump, no deviation. At the centre: Trump—wielding threats and uncertainties while testing the elasticity of a fractured coalition.





As war clouds gather over Tehran, the “America First” coalition fractures—from Carlson’s outrage to Cruz’s crusade, with Vice President JD Vance echoing the commander-in-chief’s every word. Donald Trump didn’t just win the 2024 election—he crushed it with a promise to rebuild America without stumbling into another foreign disaster. “No more stupid wars” became doctrine. His base connected with this pledge, proud that he hadn't launched any new wars.But now, deep into 2025, that legacy is under pressure. In June, Israel struck Iran’s nuclear facilities—and Trump responded by warning Iran’s leaders to surrender “unconditionally,” advising Tehran’s civilians to evacuate, and boasting that the U.S. had “total control of the skies.”The MAGA movement—defined by its distrust of foreign entanglements—is experiencing an identity crisis. The coalition that brought Trump back to power is now split, torn between instincts that fueled his rise.Carlson has emerged as the vocal anti-war leader within MAGA circles. He warned that war with Iran could end Trump’s presidency. During a dramatic on-camera exchange with Senator Ted Cruz, he challenged his hawkish views by questioning basic facts about Iran—its population, its sectarian landscape—and called out what he sees as dangerous ignorance dressed up as resolve.To Carlson, this is Iraq 2.0. And allowing MAGA to shift toward intervention is nothing short of a betrayal.Bannon warned that a war with Iran could destroy the MAGA coalition. Yet he tempered the warning with neutrality, noting that even dissenting voices would ultimately fall in line behind Trump. His message: the base doesn’t want war, but Trump remains the centre of gravity.Greene has remained firm in her opposition to escalation. She’s made it clear that another conflict in the Middle East would betray the MAGA movement’s core promise: to put America first—at home, not in yet another desert war.Gaetz has voiced deep scepticism over renewed interventionism, warning that MAGA should not fall for recycled Bush-era framing. He’s dismissed hawkish rhetoric and cautioned that any move toward war must have a clearly defined exit strategy and real American interests at stake. His message is clear: military might is not a substitute for strategic clarity.Cruz maintained a hawkish stance in public appearances, even as he fumbled through basic facts about Iran. He’s called Iran a threat and said the U.S. must act if necessary. His slip—confusing Israeli actions with American ones—highlighted the extent to which some MAGA hawks are ready for conflict, regardless of the details.Now serving as Secretary of State, Rubio has become the administration’s leading voice for a hardline Iran policy. He insists that Iran must be denied not just weapons, but even enrichment capacity. His doctrine is simple: Iran cannot even come close to the nuclear threshold.Both Levin and Hannity have called for strong action. Levin has floated the idea of regime change. Hannity has embraced the logic of preemptive strikes. They represent the older, more muscular conservatism that sees war not as a failure—but as assertion of American strength.Vice President JD Vance, once the populist realist, now speaks with tight discipline. He hasn’t condemned the hawks. He hasn’t echoed the doves. He simply follows the President’s lead—repeating Trump’s lines, offering no deviation, and avoiding ideological entanglement. Vance is not acting as a bridge between factions. He’s acting as a megaphone for Trump. His silence is strategic. His discipline is total with the belief that if he holds on long enough, he's a shoo-in to the be Trump's successor.Trump has long weaponised ambiguity. He’s sent American forces into visible alert, named Iranian leaders, threatened air superiority—and yet, he hasn’t fired a shot. This is vintage Trump: threatening force without deploying it, posturing without committing.But the longer this game stretches, the more pressure mounts. Hawks want action. The base wants peace. And Trump, ever the tactician, wants both.The language is all too familiar. Talks of WMDs. Warning of rogue regimes. Accusations of appeasement. MAGA was born in rebellion against this rhetoric. Trump won hearts by denouncing the Iraq War as a historic failure. Now, those ghosts are back. And the question is whether the movement has truly changed—or merely changed labels.Trump’s current coalition—rooted in working-class values, suburban nationalism, and youth anti-establishment sentiment—says no to foreign adventures. Most polls show his base is wary of intervention.But a gamble remains: if Trump escalates, that coalition could fracture. The internal pressure is mounting. MAGA’s future depends on whether it keeps its promise—or betrays the fierce anti-war impulse that helped redefine American politics in 2025.The Real War Is Inside MAGAThis is more than a foreign policy debate—it’s an ideological showdown.A strike on Iran may win a skirmish—but MAGA’s soul hangs in the balance. The real question now isn’t just “should we go to war?”—it’s “can MAGA survive it?”","The MAGA movement, defined by its distrust of foreign entanglements, is experiencing an identity crisis.

US Senate Clash Goes Viral; Hegseth Screams But Struggles To Answer Senator Slotkin





Matt Gaetz, the former Republican Congressman from Florida, said Thursday that Israel should also give up on its nuclear weapons and if US president Donald Trump could get it done, he would win the Nobel Peace Prize.“If Trump pulled that off,” he said, “they wouldn’t just give him the Nobel Peace Prize — they’d rename it the Trump Peace Prize,” Gaetz said on his prime time show on One America News Network he hosts now.The Republican sharply criticise US involvement in the Israel–Iran conflict. He argued that what’s being sold as a war to stop Iran’s nuclear programme was another push by Israel for regime change in the Middle East — one that looks a lot like the lead-up to the Iraq war.“Israel didn’t kick their regime change habit with Iraq or Libya or Syria. It seems they need another fix,” Gaetz said. “I wish this was really about Iran’s nuclear programme, but it’s not.”Gaetz further said Iran, unlike North Korea, didn’t currently have nuclear weapons, long-range delivery systems, or re-entry capability. “North Korea could launch a nuclear weapon at the US today. Iran can’t even get their bird in the air,” he added.Gaetz served on the House Armed Services Committee for eight years and claimed to have seen the intelligence briefings himself.He pointed out that North Korea had issued open threats against US cities like Los Angeles and Seattle, but the US wasn’t bombing their missile sites.Gaetz said that the current war push was politically motivated and hypocritical — especially because Israel’s own nuclear programme remained off-limits to international inspectors.“There’s a secret nuclear programme in the Middle East — and it’s Israel’s,” Gaetz said. “They won’t allow inspectors, they operate in full secrecy, and everyone in Washington knows it.”He said he didn't blame Israel for wanting a nuclear deterrent, but called it unfair to push the world towards war over one country’s suspected weapons while ignoring another’s. “To drag us into a regime change war over secret nuclear weapons when your ally also has secret nuclear weapons — that’s hypocritical.”Gaetz played old Fox News clips showing support for the Iraq invasion, where anchors described Saddam Hussein as an urgent threat and promised a quick, decisive victory.“I saw how wrong they were,” he said. “I went to the funerals. I saw the graves. We paid the price. Iraq war cost America $3 trillion and contributed to the rise of ISIS and China’s global power.""He also aired a recent clip from Tucker Carlson’s show where Senator Ted Cruz couldn’t tell the population of Iran while defending military action. Gaetz used it as an example of how disconnected Washington leaders were from the wars they supported.“It’s easy to back war from a Senate office or Fox News studio. No one’s firing missiles at you there,” Gaetz said. “But real people — soldiers — will have to fight and die. And many will.”The Israel–Iran war has caused divisions within Trump’s MAGA circle. Gaetz, Carlson, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and Steve Bannon have all warned against US involvement. In contrast, Fox News hosts like Sean Hannity and Mark Levin, along with Senators Lindsey Graham and Cruz, support Israel’s actions.Trump himself has not made things clear. He has demanded Iran’s “unconditional surrender” but also said, “Maybe we won’t have to fight. I’m not looking to fight. But if it’s a choice between fighting and them having a nuclear weapon, you have to do what you have to do.”","Matt Gaetz, a former Republican Congressman from Florida, said Israel should also give up on its nuclear weapons.

ISLAMABAD: In a bid to recalibrate Pakistan’s global narrative and bolster ties with Washington, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir concluded a series of high-level engagements in the United States, meeting senior American scholars, strategic experts, and international media representatives during an official visit to Washington DC, the Pakistani military said on Friday.In a carefully choreographed diplomatic offensive, Munir interacted with leading think tanks and policy institutions, offering what officials described as “Pakistan’s principled perspectives” on evolving regional and global dynamics. His engagements underscored Islamabad’s renewed focus on international outreach amid a shifting geopolitical landscape in South Asia.The army chief reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to regional stability, counterterrorism, and a rules-based global order, pitching the country as a responsible actor in an increasingly multipolar world.Munir spoke at length about Pakistan’s counter-terrorism strategy, highlighting military operations such as Maarka-e-Haqa and Operation Bunyanum Marsoos. He reminded his audience of Pakistan’s role as a frontline state in the global war on terror, citing the “immense sacrifices” borne by its security forces and civilians.Without naming India, Munir warned against “regional actors using terrorism as an instrument of hybrid warfare” – a familiar refrain in Pakistan’s diplomatic lexicon referring to its neighbour.While not new, the accusation resurfacing in the US capital, signalling Pakistan’s intent to shape the security discourse in South Asia.Munir also showcased Pakistan’s economic aspirations. He pitched the country’s untapped potential in IT, agriculture, and mineral wealth, calling on global stakeholders to invest in these “engines of shared prosperity”.From foreign policy to economic diplomacy, Munir portrayed Pakistan as a country pursuing dialogue, diplomacy, and international law — an image Islamabad has been keen to project as it seeks to distance itself from past reputational baggage.Discussing Pakistan-US relations, Munir called for transforming the historical security-centric engagement into a multidimensional partnership grounded in strategic convergence and mutual respect. He acknowledged past cooperation on counterterrorism and economic development but pushed for a broader framework of engagement.According to Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the army’s media affairs wing, participants appreciated the candid nature of the discussions and acknowledged Pakistan’s efforts to maintain regional stability. The meetings were seen as a trust-building exercise amid evolving US priorities in the Indo-Pacific region and growing scepticism over Islamabad’s commitments.The visit comes at a time when Pakistan is striving to reset ties with major powers, especially after its recent economic crises and shifting regional alignments. With India drawing closer to the US and Afghanistan remaining volatile, Islamabad is attempting to reposition itself as an indispensable — if complicated — regional player.","Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir concluded a series of high-level engagements in the United States.

The warning comes amid increasing political friction between the federal and provincial governments.Gandapur suspended implementation of the recently passed provincial budget and instructed lawmakers not to submit any cut motions during Friday’s session. He added that a new strategy would be announced on Monday.“If we don’t pass the budget, the federal government could take control of the province under the pretext of a financial emergency,” Gandapur said, accusing Islamabad of conspiring to topple his government.He also lashed out at the federal authorities for what he described as “unjust treatment” of the province following the May 9, 2023, incidents. He alleged that the public mandate in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was stolen in the aftermath.“Our leader was unjustly jailed, and the way we were treated after May 9, followed by the theft of our mandate, is unacceptable.

Trump Hosts Pakistan Army Chief Munir Alone At White House, Faces Fierce Criticism From Pentagon Vet





ISLAMABAD: The meeting between US President Donald J Trump and Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, at the White House on Thursday has set the geopolitical grapevine abuzz, with whispers of backroom deals that could reshape the balance of power in South Asia and far beyond.What began as a one-hour lunch in the Cabinet Room turned into a two-hour marathon meeting that continued in the Oval Office, attended by US secretary of state Marco Rubio, special representative Steve Witkoff, and Pakistan NSA and Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Asim Malik.The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) handout flags counter-terrorism, trade, and peace, but the real stakes — against the backdrop of Iran-Israel airstrikes and India-Pakistan tensions — reveal a high-wire act with far-reaching implications.Trump, channeling his trademark deal-maker bravado, now sees Pakistan as a strategic prize. As Israel intensifies strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites and Washington edges closer to military escalation, Pakistan’s shared border with Iran becomes critical. Sources say Trump privately pressured Munir for airspace access and intelligence on Tehran — leveraging Pakistan’s backchannel role as the host of Iran’s interests section for the US.In return, he offered advanced weaponry and economic incentives, aiming to lure Islamabad away from China’s orbit and Russia’s Brics alliance.Trump’s push to expand trade in critical minerals, cryptocurrency, AI, and energy is part of a broader strategy to anchor Pakistan within US-led markets and curb China’s regional influence. He has also claimed credit for defusing the May 2025 crisis between India and Pakistan.As Pakistan’s power broker, Munir brings serious leverage. His military’s fight against Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K) syncs with US aims in Afghanistan. With ties to Iran and a shared border, Munir can offer covert intelligence or logistical support, though Pakistan’s pro-Iran rhetoric caps public alignment. Economically, he can unlock Pakistan’s mineral and tech potential for US investors, but treading too far risks Beijing’s wrath.On India, Munir’s role in brokering the May ceasefire – praised by President Trump – has been framed in Islamabad as a direct rebuttal of New Delhi’s allegations of Pakistani involvement in cross-border terrorism. With the country facing severe economic challenges, Munir is believed to have sought US military and financial assistance to modernise Pakistan’s armed forces and stabilise its economy. Trump’s openness to providing drones or missile defence systems could significantly alter the military balance with India. Munir also reportedly urged Trump to de-escalate growing tensions between Iran and Israel, warning of broader regional instability and citing Pakistan’s vocal alignment with Tehran. In a bold diplomatic gesture, Munir extended an invitation for Trump to visit Pakistan, an effort seen as central to reshaping bilateral ties and enhancing Islamabad’s global relevance.Timed amid Middle East turmoil and South Asian friction, the Trump-Munir summit is a geopolitical pivot. It signals a fragile US-Pakistan thaw, driven by Washington’s ally hunt and Pakistan’s economic crunch. For India, it’s a call to counter a US strategy cosying up to both rivals while eyeing Iran. Trump’s deal-making and Munir’s strategic charm aim to reposition Pakistan as a US cornerstone, potentially redrawing South Asia’s power map at India’s expense. Wednesday’s White House talks weren’t just diplomacy, they were a bold move in a high-stakes regional chess game.","The meeting between US President Donald J Trump and Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, at the White House on Thursday has set the geopolitical grapevine abuzz.
