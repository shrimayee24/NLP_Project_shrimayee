NEW DELHI: India on Tuesday reiterated its rejection of US President Donald Trump's offer to mediate in the dispute with Pakistan over J&K, and said India had a long-standing national position that any issue pertaining to the Union Territory would be addressed by India and Pakistan bilaterally.""That stated policy has not changed. As you are aware, the outstanding matter is the vacation of illegally occupied Indian territory by Pakistan,"" MEA said when asked about Trump's offer.Government also rejected the US president's claim that he had threatened to stop trade with India and Pakistan to get them to agree to a ""ceasefire"".Also read: 'No mention of trade in India-US talks during India-Pakistan crisis' ""From the time Op Sindoor started on May 7 till the understanding on cessation of military action on May 10, there were conversations between Indian and US leaders on the evolving military situation. The issue of trade did not come up in any of these discussions,"" MEA said.Also, with Trump claiming that he had averted a nuclear war, govt said India's military action was entirely in the conventional domain and warned other countries not to get carried away by Pakistan's nuclear bluff.While there were reports that Pakistan's National Command Authority, which is responsible for the country's nuclear arsenal, would meet on May 10, govt recalled that Islamabad had later on record denied any ""nuclear angle"". May 10 was the day India pounded 8-10 airbases in Pakistan, forcing Pakistan to seek a DGMO-level dialogue.India's armed forces have denied they hit a nuclear site at Kirana Hills, debunking reports about a radioactive leak there. PM Narendra Modi had said on Monday that India would not tolerate any nuclear blackmail by Pakistan.""India has a firm stance that it will not give in to nuclear blackmail or allow cross-border terrorism to be conducted invoking it.

The request for this call was received by MEA from the Pakistani high commission at 1237 hours, Jaiswal said. ""The Pakistani side had initial difficulties connecting the hotline for technical reasons. The timing was then decided based on the availability of the Indian DGMO at 1535 hours,"" he added.""Early on 10th morning, we had mounted an extremely effective attack on key Pakistan Air Force bases.

No, it's not their place Yes, absolutely

NEW DELHI: Speaking in Riyadh during his Middle East tour, US President Donald Trump once again claimed the credit for brokering what he called a “historic ceasefire” between India and Pakistan, following days of heightened military tensions earlier this month.“Just days ago, my administration successfully brokered a historic ceasefire to stop the escalating violence between India and Pakistan, and I used trade to a large extent to do it,” Trump said, addressing a crowd.He added, “I said, fellas, come on, let’s make a deal. Let’s do some trading. Let’s not trade nuclear missiles. Let’s trade the things that you make so beautifully.”Trump praised the leaders of both India and Pakistan, calling them “powerful, strong, smart,” and expressed hope that the ceasefire would hold. He also suggested that US diplomacy may even lead to a potential thaw between the two countries.Trump specifically thanked Senator Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance for their role in the negotiations. “Marco, stand up. What a great job you did on that,” he said.“Maybe we can even get them together a little bit, Marco, where they go out and have a nice dinner together,” he suggested.“Millions of people could have died from that conflict that started off small and was getting bigger and bigger by the day,” Trump said.Later, White House deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott echoed Trump' claims during a press briefing saying, “We welcome the ceasefire between India and Pakistan and commend Prime Ministers Modi and Sharif for choosing the path of peace. As President Trump said, their decision reflects strength, wisdom, and fortitude. We urge both sides to maintain direct communication to preserve regional stability.”The comments come days after India launched Operation Sindoor in response to a terror attack in Pahalgam. The government said the operation targeted terrorist infrastructure inside Pakistan and degraded the country’s military capabilities.Trump's remarks came during his first stop in Saudi Arabia on a three-nation trip focused on curbing Iran’s nuclear program, ending the war in Gaza, and addressing energy security.",US President Donald Trump once again claimed the credit for brokering what he called a ‘historic ceasefire’ between India and Pakistan.

Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority handles the day-to-day operations here. It lies close to Pakistan's border with Rajasthan in India.The IAF strike created a large crater in the runway, resulting in all flight operations being made non-operational for one week.Besides Rahim Yar Khan, the IAF also decimated PAF airbases Nur Khan, Sukkur, Murid, Shahbaz, Mushaf, Rafiqui and Bholari. Its retaliatory action came after Pakistan launched missiles on Indian military installations in response to Operation Sindoor. However, India's air defence system successfully intercepted the missiles.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited IAF's second-largest airbase, Adampur in Punjab, and busted Pakistan's claim to have destroyed the airbase.Under Operation Sindoor, Indian armed forces launched precision strikes on nine terror facilities in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in the early hours of May 7. More than 100 terrorists were killed in the operation.The strikes were India's response to the terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam, where Pakistan-backed terrorists shot dead 26 male tourists on April 22.","Rahim Yar Khan is a forward operating base of the PAF’s Central Command.

SRINAGAR: Everyone except “a few media anchors living far away in Mumbai and Noida” want the pause in military operations between India and Pakistan to hold, J&K CM Omar Abdullah said Tuesday while continuing his outreach to residents of forward areas affected the most by shelling and drone attacks from across the LoC.“People living along the LoC, and even those in Srinagar and Jammu who have witnessed the situation first-hand, they all want the pause to continue,” Omar told reporters after touring north Kashmir’s battered border areas.“There has been extensive damage. Houses have been affected, shops have suffered destruction, and even a seminary has not been spared. The damage assessment will be completed within two days,” he said.The CM said the refrain across villages and towns he visited over the past three days was that bunkers should be built for all civilians. “For years, bunkers weren’t constructed because the situation didn’t demand it. Our govt will soon draft a policy on this and we will discuss it with the central govt.”Omar, who visited Tangdhar, Hajinard, Nachiyan, Shamspora, Baghbela, Batpora and Tarbonim, said the administration would do whatever it takes to help the affected population rebuild what they had lost. “The affected families have shown remarkable courage in the face of adversity. Their resilience is inspiring. The govt stands shoulder to shoulder with them. Their pain will not go unnoticed,” he said.In Srinagar, PDP president and ex-CM Mehbooba Mufti said cross-border engagement was possible even in tense times without compromising the country’s security or sovereignty.“I appeal to all the opposition parties to resist the urge for knee-jerk criticism or political point-scoring. Just as the Pahalgam (terrorist) incident united voices from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, there is a need to build a national consensus around a peace process that safeguards national interest,” Mehbooba said.Mehbooba said ex-PMs Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Manmohan Singh proved that cross-border engagement was possible without putting security or sovereignty at stake. “The Modi government should not be politically penalised for exploring peaceful means. This is a time for bipartisan statesmanship, not division.”Like Omar, she slammed those who criticise the pause in hostilities “from the comfort of air-conditioned studios and drawing rooms”, saying “they should spend time with their families on the borders to truly understand the daily reality of death and destruction”.","J&K CM Omar Abdullah says everyone except ""a few media anchors living far away in Mumbai and Noida"" want the pause in military operations to hold.

NEW DELHI: A litigant managed to get a favourable order from Supreme Court after he propped up a ""ghost"" opponent who told the court that he had compromised with the petitioner in a land dispute, which became the basis for SC for quashing orders passed by a Muzaffarpur trial court and Patna HC against the litigant in the matter.Five months later, the real opponent appeared and told the court that he had neither compromised with the petitioner nor engaged any lawyer to represent him before SC. It also came to light that the lawyer who allegedly represented the fake party does not practice law any more and he was even not aware of the case.Facing the tricky situation of who had appeared before the court on that day and who had placed the 'settlement agreement' that led to passing of the order, a bench of Justices P S Narasimha and Joymalya Bagchi directed its registry to hold an inquiry and file a report within three weeks. Making it clear that the court cannot be taken for a ride, the bench said that it would order lodging of an FIR, if needed.SC had in Dec passed the order after the 'compromise agreement' was placed before it and the order sheet of that day mentioned the names of four advocates who had appeared for the alleged fake respondent, including advocate-on-record (AOR) J M Khanna and his daughter Shefali Khanna. In this case, a caveat was filed by the fake respondent due to which notice was not issued by the court which would have been served on the real respondent and he would have come to know about the pending case.The real respondent, who is based in Muzaffarpur in Bihar, came to know about the SC's verdict when his son-in-law stumbled upon it on the SC website and he rushed to the apex court. Advocates Gyanant Singh and Abhisek Rai, appearing for him, told the bench that the order was obtained by means of fraud, deception and calculated suppression of truth and it should be recalled forthwith.During the hearing, a lawyer appearing for AOR Khanna told the court that he is now 80-years-old and he had not been practising law for the last few years and expressed surprise how his name cropped up in the case. His daughter also told the bench that she also did not appear in the case on that day.""The petitioner has not only acted in violation of legal and ethical norms but has also committed a fraud upon this court, which, if not rectified, will embolden such mala fide litigants to continue their deceitful practices,"" the respondent said.

NEW DELHI: Turkish drones , extensively used by the Pakistani army during the recent limited conflict with India, came into prominence for the first time when Ukraine used them to destroy Russian defence assets in the initial phases of Russia-Ukraine war.However, these drones, which can stay airborne for up to 27 hours, as claimed by their manufacturer, failed to penetrate targets when Russia bolstered its air defence. Ukraine, as per reports, has since been using them for reconnaissance and repositioning its artillery. India may have learnt a lesson from the Ukraine war, it seems, as it destroyed Turkish drones as well as China's missiles midair, thus denying the advantage that Pakistan had hoped to gain by unleashing them in swarms in retaliation against Operation Sindoor True, the drones supplied to Pakistan by Turkiye - which under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been nursing the dream of becoming the new leader of the Muslim world - were not of the same calibre as the ones it had sold Ukraine but it was pointed out that they were taken out mostly by cheaper 'Made-in India' drones - a blow to Erdogan's aspiration to emerge as the new Caliph.No wonder Turkiye deputed a junior representative for India's defence ministry briefing on Operation Sindoor - a move seen as frustration over its drones' failure.The Indian armed forces also have sophisticated and deadly Israeli Harop drones, also known as ""loitering munition"", which identifies a target and crashes into it with loaded explosives. These have proved to be a potent weapon in India's arsenal, with some of them believed to have destroyed Pakistan's air-defence systems and key military sites during May 7-10 conflict.","Turkish drones came into prominence for the first time when Ukraine used them to destroy Russian defence assets in the initial phases of Russia-Ukraine war.

JAMMU: In the past six-seven years, over 2,000 family bunkers were built for residents of border areas in J&K, the utility of which was realised during the recent Operation Sindoor , said union minister Dr Jitendra Singh during a day-long visit to areas along the international border on Tuesday. He also announced that an additional 600 bunkers would be constructed and an automated, centralised siren system will be set up in border areas.Dr Singh said Kathua was the first district in the country to experiment with family bunkers in border areas when he, as an MP, had taken up the issue soon after Narendra Modi took over as prime minister. Thereafter, more than 2,000 such bunkers came up in the border areas.Following the public demand for more bunkers, Dr Singh said he consulted the administration and immediately issued directions for the construction of 600 additional family bunkers and more later, if needed.In response to citizens’ complaints that the siren was not audible enough, Dr Singh said he directed the use of modern technology instead of manually operated sirens. “An automated, centralised siren system would be installed, which will be controlled from the district headquarters. It will start operating spontaneously, and the siren will be sounded through speakers set up at each border village,” he said.After Operation Sindoor was launched, Kathua district was provided with 39 medical ambulances for the convenience of border dwellers, while two more critical care ambulances were made available at GMC Kathua.During his visit, Dr Singh held a series of meetings with officials of the district administration, led by deputy commissioner Rakesh Minhas, and attended by public representatives including MLAs and DDC members. The minister subsequently met residents of border villages before heading to Jammu GMCH to inquire about the patients injured in Pakistani shelling.","In the past six-seven years, over 2,000 family bunkers were built for residents of border areas in J&K.

INDORE: After drawing widespread criticism over a video that shows Madhya Pradesh minister Vijay Shah making an indecent remark against Col Sofiya Quereshi, who has become the face of armed forces briefing the nation about operation Sindoor undertaken against Pakistan's terror network, he tendered an apology while talking to reporters on Tuesday evening.A video of Shah went viral on social media platforms on Tuesday in which he is seen referring to the Pahalgam attack by Pakistan-based terrorists and Operation Sindoor launched by the Indian armed forces against terror launchpads in Pakistan in which he made indecent and objectionable remarks against the woman army officer. He made the comments during a 'Halma' programme— a tradition to volunteer for environmental work—held in Raikunda village in Dr Ambedkar Nagar (Mhow) on Monday.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge reacted to Shah's remarks and wrote on X (Twitter), ""A BJP minister of Madhya Pradesh has made a very insulting, shameful, and cheap comment about our brave daughter…. The terrorists of Pahalgam wanted to divide the country, but the country was united during the entire 'Operation Sindoor' to give a befitting reply to the terrorists. The mentality of BJP-RSS has always been anti-women."" He asked PM Narendra Modi to remove the minister from his post.MP Congress Committee chief Jitu Patwari also slammed the minister over his remarks and said, “The cabinet minister Vijay Shah has uttered absurd words against our daughters, who jolted Pakistani forces. He used such cheap words for our daughters, Mohan Yadavji should clarify if his entire cabinet and BJP agree with Shah’s remarks, and if not, Vijay Shah should be immediately removed from the post.”“I will write to the Prime Minister, the defence minister, BJP national and state president, and MP CM to clarify their stand on Shah’s remarks,” he said.Apart from Congress leaders of Madhya Pradesh, Rajya Sabha MP Imran Pratapgarhi took to X (Twitter) to slam the minister over his remarks. The MP wrote, “The person who made this absurd and communal statement is not an ordinary man but a minister of the MP govt. He thinks that (the Indian Army official) is the sister of the terrorists, who killed innocent people in Pahalgam.This person has insulted the country's army. The Prime Minister is requested to immediately remove this person from the post of minister, and BJP chief JP Nadda should clarify whether this person's statement is the statement of Bharatiya Janata Party?” As he came under attack, Shah told a news channel that his statements were ‘misinterpreted’.“The Prime Minister has responded to those who left our sisters widowed in their own language. Do not view my speech in a different context. Some people are misinterpreting it. They are our sisters, and they have worked with the army with full strength,” he said. In his apology Shah claimed that he and his family were ‘distressed’ by the Pahalgam attack.“My family has a military background, and several members have been martyred, including during Kargil war. While making a speech with such a saddened heart, if some objectionable sentences were uttered by me, I am ready to apologise 10 times,” he said.","Madhya Pradesh minister Vijay Shah made an indecent remark against Col Sofiya Quereshi, who has become the face of armed forces briefing the nation about operation Sindoor.

Wayne Gretzky and the Donald Trump controversy: A Canadian icon’s moment of reckoning,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/wayne-gretzky-and-the-donald-trump-controversy-a-canadian-icons-moment-of-reckoning/articleshow/121139719.cms,"Wayne Gretzky's public support for Donald Trump ignited a fierce debate in Canada (Getty Images)

Canada's hockey icon meets a political reckoning

Back in early 2025, Canada found itself in an identity crisis — and at the center of it was none other than Wayne Gretzky . Long celebrated as the embodiment of Canadian humility and excellence, Gretzky became an unlikely flashpoint in a political and cultural storm that tested national sentiment like never before.The incident unfolded in the shadow of tense U.S.-Canada relations, with new American tariffs, political jabs from President Donald Trump, and a rising wave of Canadian nationalism . For years, Gretzky had lived quietly in the U.S., his image largely untarnished despite the distance. But a string of high-profile appearances alongside Trump — including his attendance at an election-night celebration and the 2025 inauguration — changed that.A photo of Gretzky wearing a white-and-gold MAGA hat went viral, and suddenly, the question wasn't about goals or assists — it was about loyalty.This was no minor controversy. “You were a great Canadian, but now you are not,” Edmonton Sports Talk’s Matthew Iwanyk famously said at the time — a quote that captured the frustration of many Canadians. In Edmonton, where Gretzky led the Oilers to four Stanley Cups, fans were openly questioning the man immortalized in bronze outside Rogers Place. Some, like Oilers fan Rob Munro, simply wished he’d “be a little more Canadian.”Gretzky’s neutral stance during the NHL ’s “4 Nations Face-Off” didn’t help. While his American counterpart wore a jersey, Gretzky appeared in a suit, giving a thumbs-up to the U.S. bench. It was the kind of symbolism that stuck — and stung.The disappointment wasn’t about party lines; it was about a sense of national pride. “It’s not that we expect more of him,” said Edmonton resident Grant Prete, who started a petition to rename Wayne Gretzky Drive. “It’s that it stings more.”Some, like Ontario Premier Doug Ford, came to his defense. “He is a patriot. He loves Canada,” Ford insisted. But in the eyes of many, Gretzky’s silence amid the controversy was deafening.Also Read: “Pretend you don’t know me”: Wayne Gretzky caught in crossfire as Donald Trump friendship sparks Canadian backlash Looking back, 2025 was the year Canadians asked themselves a hard question: What do we do when our greatest hero no longer reflects the values we hold dear?","Wayne Gretzky's public support for Donald Trump ignited a fierce debate in Canada.

As President Donald Trump reached Saudi Arabia to a purple carpet welcome, he was seen introducing Elon Musk to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman -- in a video that has gone viral.

Saudis announced in 2021 that they would roll out purple carpets, instead of red, as lavender is associated with blossoming wildflowers and is a symbol of Saudi generosity.“I really believe we like each other a lot,” Trump said of the crown prince, touting their “tremendous relationship” and calling the visit an “honor.” Trump said he was “so impressed” with MBS, calling him “very wise, wise beyond his years.”Ahead of his crucial Middle East visit, Trump said on Monday that the Iranians were being reasonable and talking intelligently in negotiations with Washington over nuclear program. “Soon I’m heading over to the Middle East, and we’ll see what we’ll do in regards to Iran. I think you have some very good things happening there,” Trump told reporters.“They can’t have a nuclear weapon, but I think they’re talking very intelligently.

Taylor Swift blends seamlessly into Kelce family circle as couple opts for quiet celebration over flashy headlines

Taylor Swift is proving that love isn't always about red carpets and stadium lights. This Mother’s Day, the global music superstar skipped the spotlight and leaned into family time, joining her boyfriend Travis Kelce for an intimate brunch with his family in Philadelphia.According to Page Six, Swift and Kelce were spotted celebrating Donna Kelce, Travis’ mother, with a relaxed meal at Talula’s Garden—an upscale yet cozy restaurant in the heart of the city. Rather than choosing a private room or making a grand entrance, the couple quietly dined among regular patrons, aiming for an under-the-radar experience.An eyewitness at the brunch said the pair was “almost undetected”, a rare feat considering Swift’s global fame. The laid-back outing included not just Travis and his mom Donna, but also his brother Jason Kelce, Jason’s wife Kylie, and some of their children. The scene was a picture of warmth and normalcy, reinforcing the tight-knit nature of the Kelce clan—and the growing closeness of Swift to the family.Adding a subtle Easter egg to the moment, Swift wore a black Christy Dawn dress with a daisy print, a choice fans quickly linked to lyrics from her 2017 Reputation album. It’s the kind of detail Swift’s followers have come to expect—and cherish.While the gathering remained mostly off-camera, at least one onlooker discreetly snapped photos, which later appeared on TikTok. A source at the scene noted that a young girl initially reached for her phone to take a photo of Swift but hesitated, suggesting the brunch carried an atmosphere of respect and privacy.One insider praised Jason and Kylie Kelce’s daughters as “incredibly polite, sweet, and absolutely adorable,” adding a heartwarming touch to the family affair.Also Read: Taylor Swift sparks pregnancy rumors as she steps out with Travis Kelce on secretive Mother’s Day outing For a couple often in the headlines, this Mother’s Day celebration was refreshingly low-key.

Pune Cab Driver Fare: Anger Grows as Drivers Switch Between Meter and App to Hike Charges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/anger-in-pune-as-cab-drivers-switch-between-meter-and-app-to-charge-higher-fares/articleshow/121121009.cms,"



PUNE: Recently, NIBM Road resident Saqib Alam Shaikh took an Uber cab from the airport to his home, a distance of 15km. When he reached, Shaikh was in for a surprise: the cabbie told him the fare would be the ""meter rate"", not the one the Uber app showed.""He told me to go to www.onlymeter.in, enter the distance myself and claimed that other cab drivers in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad were following this practice. The distance was 14.8km and the website calculated the fare to Rs 370. The moment he heard this, he frowned and told me to pay the amount the Uber app showed, which was Rs 400. I was too tired to argue; I paid Rs 400,"" Shaikh told TOI.Several commuters who used a ride-hailing app recently - both Uber and Ola - have reported similar complaints. The cab drivers said they would be charged the ""meter rate"", but quickly fell back to the app's fare when it showed a higher amount. The reverse has happened too. Essentially, the cab drivers used two fare-calculation systems but ultimately relied on the one showing the higher sum.""For a 19-km ride I took, the fare on the app was Rs 280, but I had to pay Rs 500,"" said Anup Singh Naravani who used Ola. ""Cabbies are charging the meter fare, but when there's surge-pricing on the app, they tell us to pay that.There is no logic here, except profiteering,"" Naravani said.This problem began after May 1, when Keshav Kshirsagar, president of Indian Gig Workers Front, announced cabbies would be charging the ""meter fares"" as per approved govt rates, just like autorickshaw drivers. It was the result of a demand by cabbies who saw auto drivers making much more per kilometre, thanks to their higher minimum fares.The meter charge, mind you, doesn't come from an actual meter inside the cab. The Gig Workers Front launched the website www.onlymeter.in, which they said passengers can use to calculate fares themselves. The fares on the website were govt-approved - Rs 37 for the first 1.5 km and Rs 25 per km subsequently.""This was a bad move,"" said Payal Mehta, a working professional. She said: ""There are no meters in these cabs like the autorickshaws. The cabbies ask us to open the website, enter the total distance, see the fares and pay. But how do we know if these charges are RTO-approved? And has the RTO approved this website? I recently travelled from SGS Mall to FC Road on a Rapido cab and the app fare was Rs 155. But I paid the website's fare of Rs 170. ""Another commuter, who didn't want to be named, tagged Uber on social media. ""Why are cab drivers charging Rs 25 per km and asking to pay by meter? I paid Rs 900 instead of Rs 505 without an invoice,"" he wrote.When contacted, this commuter told TOI: ""If they want to charge us this way, they should install meters in their cabs. My cab driver on that ride said I would get a bill, but I got nothing.""TOI contacted Uber and Ola for answers on Monday, but had not received them till the time of going to print.Kshirsagar from the Gig Workers Front said he was aware of cabbies switching fares. ""They should not engage in such activities. We will tell them this,"" he said.Calls made to Pune RTO Archana Gaikwad on Monday went unanswered. Deputy RTO Swapnil Bhosle said he would return the call and it's awaited. Another RTO official said they would look into the matter.","Several commuters who used a ride-hailing app recently - both Uber and Ola - have reported similar complaints.

Yes, it’s a direct result. No, it’s purely a criminal act.





BENGALURU: With surveillance levels high across the city in the backdrop of Indo-Pak tensions, a chilling call to police shattered the stillness of the early-morning hours Monday. The message was alarming: ""A man with a gun has entered the pub.""The message triggered a chain reaction with scenes unfolding like in a gripping thriller: The area was cordoned off. Armed commandos descended with their assault rifles. Drones were brought in to scan rooftops. And, bomb detection and disposal squad personnel were kept on standby.The drama unfolded at Geometry Brewery and Kitchen in Rajajinagar II Stage after one of the security guards, Vikas, noticed suspicious movements inside the pub around 3.35am. He noticed an intruder had broken the lock of a door and entered the building. Vikas called his supervisor, Vinay Kumar, at 3.38am and the latter, along with office attendant Shyam, rushed to the spot. In his complaint, Vinay told police he asked Vikas to stay outside the door at the entrance while he and Shyam went into the building.Vinay noticed that the main switch of the building had been turned off by the miscreant. Power supply to the lights and CCTV had also been disconnected.They both used the torch on their mobile phones and went in search of the intruder. They spotted a person near the office of the pub owner on the third floor. As they neared him, the intruder threatened to attack them with a weapon, which appeared to be a gun. The miscreant then asked Vinay to reveal where the money was. Fearing the gun, Vinay showed him the drawer in his boss's chamber. The miscreant broke the drawer and took Rs 50,000, Vinay told police.With the same weapon, the miscreant threatened Vinay and Shyam not to raise an alarm and entered another room on the same floor. Vinay and Shyam rushed out of the building, and assuming that the miscreant was still in the building, they dialled 112 and complained. A police team visited the spot by 4am. They told cops that the miscreant was aged 24-26 years and had covered his face with a mask.The two words, gun and pub, were enough for police to quickly swing into action. A few cops on night patrol from Subramanyanagar police station and neighbouring police stations reached Geometry and surrounded the building. Later, a quick reaction team (QRT) consisting of around 15 personnel with rifles surrounded the building. But after nearly six hours of intense search and suspense, the episode ended not with a standoff or a shootout, but a surprising twist: The armed intruder could not be found!A senior officer said: ""We verified CCTV footage from the surrounding buildings and found that the miscreant jumped from the first floor of the building through a sliding window.""A case has been registered under BNS for robbery and house-trespass or housebreaking. ""We are investigating from all angles. But, we are sure it has nothing to do with the conflict situation; it is an incident of theft which became robbery as he threatened the pub staff,"" an officer said.DCP (north) Saidulu Adavath camped on the premises and supervised the operation. Around 9am, he announced that the miscreant had managed to escape.","The incident occurred at Geometry Brewery and Kitchen in Rajajinagar II Stage.

No, don't call it purple. When President Donald Trump disembarked from Air Force One in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, he stepped onto the rich lavender-colored carpet unfurled before him, just one feature of the lavish welcome extended to the visiting American leader on the first day of his Gulf tour.Along with a fighter-jet escort in the air and riders on Arabian horses on the ground, the lavender carpet is one of the distinctive and symbolic Saudi protocols for greeting high-profile dignitaries. Saudi Arabia swapped red carpets for lavender in 2021, as the ruling royal family sought to define its own protocols and celebrate national identity, according to a report by the official Saudi Press Agency published at the time.""Lavender in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia is associated with blossoming wildflowers that carpet the kingdom's desert landscapes in the spring and is a symbol of Saudi generosity,"" the report said.In spring, Saudi Arabia's rugged dunes are covered in lavender, basil and Germander, a flowering shrub that grows across the Arabian Peninsula, also known by the Arabic name ""Aihan.""The color of the carpet is also a nod to how the blooms transform an otherwise harsh desert landscape, the report said, symbolizing the growth that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has promised to generate through his blueprint to diversify the economy of the oil-dependent kingdom, called ""Vision 2030.""The carpet features a border of the traditional Al Sadu textile design created by Bedouin women. The geometric patterns, tightly woven on a hand loom, were included on a list of the intangible cultural heritage of humanity compiled by the United Nations cultural agency, UNESCO, in 2020.Saudi Arabia first rolled out a lavender carpet in 2021, for Sheikh Mohammad Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, a key Saudi partner in the Gulf, according to the Saudi Press Agency.

DHAKA: Pakistan's high commissioner to Bangladesh, Syed Ahmed Maroof , who has been notably active since the fall of the Sheikh Hasina govt, has taken sudden leave and departed Dhaka, prompting a wave of speculation in diplomatic circles and on social media.Maroof left Dhaka on May 11, travelling back to Islamabad via Dubai. On the same day, the Pakistan high commission in Dhaka officially notified Bangladesh's ministry of foreign affairs of his departure. A spokesperson for the embassy said the envoy is in Pakistan for ""consultations"" but did not elaborate further. The commission said deputy high commissioner Muhammad Asif will serve as acting high commissioner . However, it has not disclosed the expected length of Maroof's leave in its formal communication.Maroof had played a prominent role in organising high-level visits, including that of Pakistan's foreign secretary, and has travelled extensively across Bangladesh, with his most recent visit to Cox's Bazar on May 9. Given his high-profile role, Maroof's abrupt departure has fuelled speculation about the reasons behind his leave. Some observers have questioned whether it reflects a shift in Pakistan's diplomatic strategy or relates to recent regional developments. Maroof assumed his post in Dec 2023.","Pakistan's high commissioner to Bangladesh, Syed Ahmed Maroof, has taken sudden leave. Maroof left Dhaka on May 11, travelling back to Islamabad via Dubai.

Nine months after the dramatic toppling of the Sheikh Hasina government in a student-led uprising , former Bangladesh President Abdul Hamid has quietly fled the country, reportedly donning a lungi and wheeled through the airport in a wheelchair in the dead of night.According to Dhaka Post, Hamid boarded a Thai Airways flight at 3:05 am Thursday, accompanied by his wife, brother, and brother-in-law.

We have not received any instructions to ban him.

Flooding in rural western Maryland forced the evacuation of an elementary school Tuesday afternoon as water began to breach the second floor, according to local officials.Homes and businesses in downtown Westernport were also inundated with floodwaters after hours of heavy rain Officials reassured the public that students and staff were safe as concerned parents and other community members posted on social media wondering how long the emergency situation would last at Westernport Elementary School.Allegany County spokesperson Kati Kenney said responders used rescue boats to safely evacuate the school. About 150 students and 50 adults were evacuated during 15 boat trips.Kenney said additional evacuations were underway in nearby areas, with reports of people trapped in cars and houses, but no injuries had been reported as of late Tuesday afternoon. She said emergency crews from surrounding counties were helping with the response in the small community near the West Virginia line.Another elementary school was also evacuated, and students at a middle school were sheltering in place, the Allegany County Department of Emergency Services said Tuesday evening. Officials said three emergency shelters had been opened across the county.Aaron Stallings, rushed to Westernport Elementary to pick up his little sister earlier Tuesday afternoon, but he soon realized his car wouldn't make it.Stallings said he hopped a fence and made his way on foot through the shin-deep water.""I knew my car was not going to get through, so I had to find an alternate route,"" he said.Stallings said children were being kept on the second and third floors when he made his way inside. Minutes after he located his sister with the help of the principal, the water level on the first floor had already risen again to his knees and was rushing under the school doors.Once he waded back outside with his sister, Stallings turned around to capture video of the scene, where parked cars and a dumpster were floating through the school's parking lot.Alley Wade also left work early when she heard about flooding downtown. She and her husband hoped to pick up their two sons, ages 8 and 10, but they couldn't get to the school because roads were already closed. Instead, they spent most of the afternoon standing around in the rain anxiously watching the floodwaters rise.""It was stressful because I felt so helpless,"" Wade said.The family was finally reunited after the students had been evacuated. Wade said there were a lot of crying kids, but thankfully everyone was safe.Roads throughout the area were closed due to flooding, including major arteries, according to the Allegany County Sheriff's Office.Westernport Mayor Judy Hamilton said the town has been prone to severe flooding in the past, but they weren't expecting it today.""It just seemed to happen all at once,"" she said. ""My heart is breaking.""She said the evacuated students were taken to higher ground and sheltered in a church building, where they would be kept safe by teachers and staff until their parents could pick them up.With a population under 2,000 people, Westernport is located in the far corner of western Maryland. Its downtown took shape in a valley where George's Creek flows into the North Branch Potomac River.The National Weather Service reported widespread flash flooding in the area Tuesday afternoon.""We are closely monitoring the flood conditions that are present across Western Maryland due to heavy rainfall, especially in Allegany County,"" Governor Wes Moore said in a social media post, adding that the state and local authorities were actively responding to the inundation.Hamilton said the last time Westernport suffered from devastating floods was in 1996.""But we're strong and we always build back,"" she said.In West Virginia, Governor Patrick Morrisey declared a state of emergency Tuesday night in Mineral County, along the Maryland border, due to severe storms and heavy rains that resulted in flash flooding.

Judge allows Trump administration to use wartime law to deport Venezuelan gang members,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/judge-allows-trump-administration-to-use-wartime-law-to-deport-venezuelan-gang-members/articleshow/121149915.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: AP)





A federal judge in Pennsylvania on Tuesday ruled that the Trump administration can invoke the 1798 Alien Enemies Act (AEA) to deport Venezuelan nationals alleged to be members of the gang Tren de Aragua, marking the first court decision to endorse such use of the centuries-old wartime law.US district judge Stephanie Haines, a Trump appointee, issued the ruling in the case of a Venezuelan man identified as ASR, who denies being a gang member.Haines ruled that the administration may proceed with deportations under the AEA, but only after giving individuals at least 21 days' notice in both English and Spanish and ensuring they have an ""opportunity to be heard"" in court.Interpreters must also be provided when necessary.The decision contrasts with rulings from judges in Texas, Colorado, and New York, who previously found that US President Donald Trump's use of the AEA was legally flawed. Those courts said mass migration or alleged gang membership did not meet the law’s wartime standards, which refer to acts like “invasions” or “predatory incursions.”As per The New York Times, Judge Haines’ order allows deportations within her jurisdiction in western Pennsylvania, which includes the privately operated Moshannon Valley Processing Center.Haines said her court had jurisdiction despite ASR being transferred to Texas in violation of a temporary restraining order she had issued.Although Judge Haines did not determine whether ASR was a member of Tren de Aragua, she criticised the administration’s prior practice of deporting some people “within a matter of hours,” and stated such actions risk the wrongful removal of individuals who are not gang members.“This case poses significant issues that are deeply interwoven with the constitutional principles upon which this Nation’s government is founded,” Haines wrote.The Trump administration declared Tren de Aragua a foreign terrorist organisation earlier this year and began deporting alleged members, many to El Salvador’s CECOT prison under a $6 million arrangement.According to The New York Times, US officials use an eight-point system, including tattoos and clothing, to determine alleged gang ties.Lee Gelernt of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), who is representing ASR, said the ruling would be appealed. “We strongly disagree with the Court’s decision to allow the government to continue using this wartime authority during peacetime,” Gelernt said. However, he welcomed the court’s insistence on giving people due process instead of “removing them in a mere 12 hours.”Another federal judge in Texas, David Briones, temporarily barred the administration from deporting a Venezuelan woman held in El Paso under the same law. According to news agency AP, Briones said she was likely to succeed in proving that the proclamation violated due process and wrongly portrayed Tren de Aragua as equivalent to a foreign invasion.The Supreme Court had earlier allowed the administration to continue using the AEA on the condition that deportees are given a chance to contest their removal. With conflicting lower court rulings now in place, the matter is expected to escalate again to the Supreme Court.","US district judge Stephanie Haines, a Trump appointee, issued the ruling in the case of a Venezuelan man identified as ASR, who denies being a gang member.Haines ruled that the administration may proceed with deportations under the AEA, but only after giving individuals at least 21 days' notice.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121149937,imgsize-867553,width-400,resizemode-4/121149937.jpg"

US President Donald Trump's administration has escalated its pressure on Harvard University , cutting another $450 million in federal grants on top of the $2.2 billion already frozen, reports CNNIn a statement released on Tuesday, the White House's Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism announced that ""eight federal agencies across the government are announcing the termination of around $450 million in grants to Harvard, which is in addition to the $2.2 billion that was terminated"" previously. The statement called Harvard’s campus “a breeding ground for virtue signalling and discrimination.”“There is a dark problem on Harvard’s campus, and by prioritising appeasement over accountability, institutional leaders have forfeited the school’s claim to taxpayer support,” the statement, signed by attorneys from the Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services, asserted.This move is the latest in a broader battle between the Trump administration and elite universities, particularly over issues like diversity initiatives, financial controls, and the admissions process. Columbia University and Ohio State University have also been targets, with both institutions losing federal funding.The funding dispute began after Harvard refused to comply with requests outlined in an April 11 letter from the Trump administration. These included demands for governance reforms, an audit of ""viewpoint diversity"" among students and faculty, and new policies surrounding anti-Semitism on campus.In response, Harvard filed a lawsuit against the administration, accusing it of attempting to use federal funding as leverage to influence academic decision-making at the university.“The University will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights,” Harvard President Alan Garber said at the time. “Neither Harvard nor any other private university can allow itself to be taken over by the federal government.”The hearing of the case is set for late July, and the funding freeze is expected to remain in place until then. In addition, Harvard faces multiple investigations from the administration. These probes include allegations of civil rights violations related to its handling of pro-Palestinian protests last year and claims of discrimination within its prestigious Harvard Law Review. Furthermore, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is investigating Harvard’s diversity efforts, particularly concerning scholarships for underrepresented minorities and its faculty hiring practices.Harvard has asserted that it does not use racial quotas or ideological tests in hiring, saying that diversity, equity, and inclusion are not the determining factors in employment decisions.",The White House's Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism announced that $450 million in grants to Harvard will be terminated.

Original Sin





, the bombshell new book revealing the crisis of the Democrat campaign, has claimed that Joe Biden was so lost at a fundraiser that he did not recognise George Clooney . Clooney was shaken to the core and then wrote his (in)famous piece in the NYT asking Biden not to contest this election. After this revelation was made by this yet-to-be-published book written by Alex Thompson and Jake Tapper, social media users started saying that now everything makes sense -- as to why a lifelong Democrat like Clooney turned against Biden, his longtime friend.The awkward interaction took place at a Biden fundraiser that Clooney organized. The book says the assisting aide alerted Biden by saying 'You know George' as the duo met and Biden did 'Yeah, yeah' and then said, ""Thank you for being here.""George Clooney was certain that Biden did not recognize him. ""That thing, the moment where you recognize someone you know -- especially a famous person who's doing a f**king fund-raiser for you -- it was delayed. It was uncomfortable,"" the book says quoting a Hollywood VIP who witnessed the incident.The aide then clarified that it was George Clooney and to that, Biden said, ""Oh yeah! Hi, George!""“Clooney had expressed concern about Biden’s health before — a White House aide had told him a few months before that they were working on getting the president to take longer steps when he walked — but obviously the problem went far beyond his gait,” the book said.Clooney had not seen Biden personally since December 2022 and so he was shocked seeing Biden's decline.This was followed by Clooney's NYT piece that Biden should drop out of the race because he can't win. “It’s devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fundraiser was not the Joe ‘big F-ing deal’ Biden of 2010,” Clooney wrote at the time. “He wasn’t even the Joe Biden of 2020.

NEW DELHI: Early in March, the US arrested in Afghanistan an ISIS-K operative involved in the 2021 Abbey Gate bombing that killed 13 Marines. President Donald Trump was quick to thank Pakistan for its help in nabbing the high-value fugitive from the Pak-Afghan border. ""I want to thank the government of Pakistan for helping arrest this monster,"" he told US Congress.But what was brushed under the carpet was an open secret in intelligence circles: The operative, Sharifullah, had been in Pakistan spy agency ISI's custody for over a year. ISI ran multiple operations using his network and ultimately handed him over to the CIA at the right time - when the regime changed in Washington.This was not the first instance of Pakistan trying to please the US by handing over terrorists that it had been using to achieve its own goals. ISI had played the same trick in 2010 when it 'suddenly discovered' Taliban military commander Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar and handed him over to CIA.The case of Osama bin Laden and his courier, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, further exposed the duplicity of Pakistan and its military-industrial complex. Pakistani intelligence agencies had claimed they had no knowledge of Osama's presence in Abbottabad despite the compound where he was staying being just about a kilometre away from the Pakistan Military Academy.The Americans, it appears, didn't believe the Pakistanis and kept on hunting for the 9/11 plotter.But while his capture and killing vindicated the US's lack of trust in Islamabad, American leaders continued to allow themselves to be baited by the Pakistanis. Trump, who considers himself to be the greatest deal maker, seems to be the latest victim of Pakistan's dual game, feeling beholden to the favour that ISI did by offering Sharifullah as a trophy.Sharifullah and Osama are not standalone cases. In 2002, a bombing at nightclubs in Bali had left over 200 people dead, including several Americans. The prime suspect was Umar Patek, a suspected member of the militant group Jemaah Islamiyah. The US had announced a $1 million bounty on him.On January 25, 2011, Patek was dramatically captured by Pakistani officials in Abbottabad and handed over to the US, which then passed him on to Indonesia as a gesture which ""demonstrated the international cooperation between the US and Indonesia in addressing terrorism"". Pakistan had similarly arrested Osama's man Friday Abu Zubaydah in Faisalabad six months after the 9/11 attacks. He was swiftly transferred to CIA custody.These capture-extraditions, though seen as attempts by Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to counter-terrorism, have actually been selective and strategic, aimed at appeasing the US rather than genuinely combating terrorism, a senior officer said.","US arrested in Afghanistan an ISIS-K operative involved in the 2021 Abbey Gate bombing that killed 13 Marines. President Donald Trump was quick to thank Pakistan for its help in nabbing the high-value fugitive. The operative, Sharifullah, had been in Pakistan spy agency ISI's custody for over a year.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121147976,imgsize-681357,width-400,resizemode-4/121147976.jpg"

Pakistan’s ‘innocent preacher’ is actually a global terrorist,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-innocent-preacher-is-actually-a-global-terrorist/articleshow/121123757.cms,"Pakistan had claimed that the man leading the prayers was Abdul Rauf (circled), a preacher and member of Pakistan Markazi Muslim League. But it turns out that he was actually Hafiz Abdul Rauf — a ‘specially designated global terrorist’ by the US who is also on SDN (Specially Designated Nationals) list of the US govt (AFP photo)





Pakistan’s misinformation campaign was exposed yet again after its claim that the man leading funeral prayers for terrorists was an innocent preacher turned out to be blatant lie and the man in question was identified as a designated global terrorist During a press conference, Pakistan’s DG-ISPR (Director General of Inter-Services Public Relations) had flashed the national ID card of a man with a similar name, Abdul Rauf, claiming that he was a preacher and a member of the Pakistan Markazi Muslim League (PMML) party.However, details from the same bio-data exposed the intricate web of misinformation spun by the ISI. It turned out that Abdul Rauf was not a preacher or Masood Azhar’s slain brother with the same name but a different individual with ties to Lashkar-eTaiba. The man, Hafiz Abdul Rauf , is a ‘specially designated global terrorist’ (SDGT) by the US department of treasury and is also on the SDN (Specially Designated Nationals) list of the US government.Pakistan’s lies were busted from their computerised national identity card (CNIC) number visible in the document flashed by DG ISPR Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif. The number 35202-5400413-9 on the document is the same as the one listed by the US treasury and the Office of Foreign Assets Control which incidentally also lists Lt Gen Sharif’s father, Mahmood Sultan Bashiruddin, as a designated terrorist with ties to al-Qaida.In the press conference held by DG ISPR during Operation Sidoor, a Pakistan Air Force officer also claimed to have shown “tactical brilliance” in Pulwama, which is being interpreted as an acknowledgement of the Pakistani military’s role in the 2019 Pulwama terror attack that killed 40 CRPF personnel.They then went on to allege that India’s claims of Abdul Rauf being a terrorist were not true.Incidentally, the same photograph of Abdul Rauf at the burial was used by India to identify and release the names of senior Pakistan army personnel and key police officials who attended the funeral of terrorists — including high-ranking officers such as Lt Gen Fayyaz Hussain Shah and Inspector General of Police Usman Anwar.According to the US treasury department, Hafiz Abdul Rauf, a member of LeT’s senior leadership since 1999, is the chief of Falah-i-Insaniat Foundation, operating LeT’s relief activities in disguise.","Pakistan had claimed that the man leading the prayers was Abdul Rauf, a preacher and member of Pakistan Markazi Muslim League.
