"Can Sharjeel, Umar speeches be deemed terror acts: Supreme Court to cops",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/can-sharjeel-umar-speeches-be-deemed-terror-acts-supreme-court-to-cops/articleshow/125900689.cms,"The Supreme Court questioned Delhi Police on invoking stringent UAPA provisions against riot accused for speeches, seeking justification for linking terror acts to their words. Justices sought clarity on how Section 15, pertaining to terrorist acts, applies when arms weren't directly used by the accused, who have been jailed for over five years.

Sharjeel seems to be a punching bag: SC

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court questioned Delhi Police Wednesday over how Section 15 of UAPA, which pertains to terrorist acts, can be invoked against Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam and other accused in a Delhi riots case for giving speeches and how terror acts can be linked with such speeches.A bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and N V Anjaria, which reserved its order on bail pleas of the six accused, sought a response from additional solicitor general S V Raju in light of senior advocate Siddharth Dave's contention that at most Section 13 (unlawful activities) and Section 18 (conspiracy) could be invoked for the speeches.The ASG submitted that the riots took place because of a conspiracy hatched by the accused and whatever they had said in their speeches became reality. Raju said Imam's speech on blocking Chicken's Neck was an attack on the integrity of the country and Khalid's speech on chakka jam was an attack on economic security and justified invoking Section 15.The court thereafter pointed out that Delhi Police had not attributed the wielding of arms or explosives to the six accused, which is a requirement under the provision. Raju, however, said that petrol bombs were used in Delhi riots.""It is a case of conspiracy. It is not my case that they used petrol bombs. My case is that they are part of the conspiracy to create the situation for the use of petrol bombs. For use of petrol bombs, there is a separate case against other people,"" he said.The bench then wrapped up the hearing, which had stretched over 11 days, and reserved its order. As the Delhi Police's arguments were particularly focused on Imam's speeches, which were also played in the courtroom to oppose the bail plea, and the other five accused - Umar Khalid, Gulfisha Fatima, Meeran Haider, Shadab Ahmed and Mohd Saleem Khan - had distanced themselves from him, the bench observed that Imam seemed to be a punching bag for both sides.The accused, who have been in custody for more than five years, approached the apex court after their bail plea had been rejected by Delhi High Court. Opposing their bail plea, Delhi Police accused them of indulging in regime change and told the court that they were behind ""well-crafted, orchestrated, preplanned, choreographed riots"" to divide the country on communal lines to achieve ""the final regime change goal"".The accused, however, told the court that holding protests and opposing the govt was not an offence, and they are being prosecuted to send a message to others that anyone who raises their voice would be similarly punished. Invoking Gandhi, they said that non-violent protest and civil disobedience was a part and parcel of democracy and cannot be criminalised, as happened in the colonial era. As Delhi Police played their allegedly inflammatory speeches, the accused brought to the court's notice clippings of their speeches in which they had talked about the constitutional spirit and responding to hate with love, to violence with non-violence and enmity with brotherhood.","Justices sought clarity on how Section 15, pertaining to terrorist acts, applies when arms weren't directly used by the accused. Justices Aravind Kumar and N V Anjaria reserved its order on bail pleas of the six accused. Delhi Police accused them of indulging in regime change.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125900689,imgsize-625663,width-400,resizemode-4/125900689.jpg"

Interpol Blue Notice Explained: How CBI Tracks Absconding Luthra Brothers In Goa Nightclub Fire Case

NEW DELHI: Goa Police have detained Ajay Gupta, a co-owner of the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub, after a devastating fire at the Arpora establishment killed 25 people. Gupta, who was held in Delhi on Tuesday, insisted he had no role in the day-to-day running of the club. “I am just a partner. I don’t know anything,” he said soon after being picked up, following a Lookout Circular issued against him.The arrest comes as investigators widen their search for the club’s primary owners, brothers Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, who fled to Phuket hours after the blaze. Interpol has issued a Blue Corner Notice to help trace them, and officers say this was processed unusually quickly. Goa Police are coordinating with the CBI and Interpol, and Chief Minister Pramod Sawant has said a team will be sent to Thailand to bring the accused back.Also read: Goa authorities trashed own report on violations by club The Bureau of Immigration earlier informed police that the Luthras boarded IndiGo flight 6E 1073 from Delhi to Phuket on Sunday morning. A notice seeking an explanation for why their passports should not be impounded has been issued by the regional passport office. A Blue Corner Notice has also been issued against the property owner, British national Surinder Kumar Khosla.Gupta is expected to be flown to Goa on Wednesday and placed under arrest once formalities are complete.Five others connected with the nightclub — chief general manager Rajiv Modak, general manager Vivek Singh, bar manager Rajiv Singhania, gate manager Riyanshu Thakur and employee Bharat Kohli — have already been arrested.Goa Tourism Minister Rohan Khaunte called the fire “a very tragic episode”, saying accountability must be fixed and that an inquiry should deliver a factual report. On Tuesday, the district administration also demolished part of the Romeo Lane restaurant in Vagator, owned by the Luthras, citing illegal construction.","Goa Police detain Ajay Gupta, a co-owner of the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub.

A costly affair

On Dec 2, a nursing student takes a cab to SMVT railway station to board train to Ernakulam

She calls her boyfriend in Ernakulam to inform she's catching a 5.30am train

Cab reaches the station. The student and driver walk around the station and spend the night in the car

On Dec 6, student files gang-rape complaint against the driver and his friends

Driver, a father of two, gets arrested. He maintains he's innocent

Police check CCTV footage and do not find driver's friends and realise it was a consensual encounte

WhatsApp messages on driver's phone show student texting him from Dec 3, indicating good relationship between the two

The complainant gets summoned. She confesses to have filed a false case to avoid her boyfriend's questions about marks on her neck

BENGALURU: A 22-year-old nursing student's claim of being gang-raped by a cab driver and his accomplices near Sir M Visvesvaraya Terminal has been revealed as false. Police found CCTV footage and WhatsApp chats indicating a consensual encounter. The woman, who filed the complaint on Dec 6, allegedly fabricated the story to avoid her boyfriend's questions about the scratch marks on her neck.The investigation is ongoing, and the driver, who has pleaded his innocence, remains in police custody.On the night of Dec 6, the nursing student from a private college and originally from Kerala, reported to Madiwala police station that she had been gang-raped by a cab driver and several of his friends inside the vehicle near Sir M Visvesvaraya Terminal on the night of Dec 2.In response, police quickly registered a gang-rape case and transferred it to Banaswadi police station due to jurisdictional issues. Before this transfer, senior police officers were informed of the incident, and based on the student's statement, the driver was arrested at his residence in east Bengaluru.The cab driver, a 33-year-old father of two with a homemaker wife, was in shock upon hearing the allegations against him.Throughout the process, he maintained his innocence.Meanwhile, police reviewed CCTV footage from the incident location and were surprised to see the nursing student and the cab driver together at the railway station between 11.30pm on Dec 2 and 5.30am on Dec 3. Additionally, they were unable to find the alleged ""gang members"" mentioned by the student.The footage clearly showed the two moving together after exiting the cab, re-entering the vehicle during the night, and then walking around the station. Eventually, the woman boarded the Ernakulam train after 5.30am.Authorities also checked the cab driver's WhatsApp messages and discovered that the nursing student had sent him numerous messages from Dec 3. Some of these messages suggested a consensual interaction and indicated a good relationship between them even after the encounter. Police then summoned the woman for questioning.When pressed, she admitted to have made the false claim to avoid her boyfriend's questions about the scratch marks on her neck, which had occurred during her time in the vehicle with the cab driver. According to the cab driver, he was familiar with the student because they both were from Kerala, and he had dropped her off at the railway station that night. After getting into the cab, the nursing student had even called her boyfriend in Ernakulam to inform him that she would be catching the early-morning train.","A 22-year-old nursing student's claim of being gang-raped by a cab driver and his accomplices has been revealed as false.

Amit Shah gives point-by-point rebuttal on 'vote chori' charge

NEW DELHI: The debate on the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) in the Lok Sabha turned heated on Wednesday as leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi challenged home minister Amit Shah to an open debate, prompting a firm response from the minister: ""I will decide.""As Shah countered the opposition’s allegations of 'vote chori' and referred to Rahul Gandhi’s charge of ""multiple voters at one Haryana house,"" the Congress leader stood up, interrupting the speech.""My question yesterday was that for the first time in history, full immunity was given to the election commissioner. I wanted to know the reasoning behind this decision. Secondly, about Haryana, he [Amit Shah] took one example of fake voters, but there are 19 lakh fake voters,” Rahul said.""You tell us ... actually, let us have a debate on my press conference, very good idea, let us go, let us have a debate,"" he added.""Amit Shah ji, I challenge you, I challenge you to have a debate,"" Rahul declared in the House.Amid uproar, Shah responded, ""Speaker sir, I want to clarify first, I have been elected as an MLA or MP for the last 30 years. I have a long experience of the procedures.""Looking directly at Rahul Gandhi, he said in a stern manner, ""Parliament will not proceed according to your wishes.I will decide the sequence of my speech. The Parliament will not work like this.""""Speaker sir, he should have some patience to listen to my answer. I will reply to each and everything. But he will not decide the sequence of my speech, I will decide it,"" Shah reiterated.""This is a completely defensive response, a scared response,"" Rahul retorted.Resuming his address with a noticeably calm tone, Shah told Speaker Om Birla, ""I can see worry lines on your face. Do not worry, I will not be provoked by them. I will continue with my reply.""Shah then went on to address the 'vote chori' accusations, stating that such issues occurred during the tenures of Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi. He also referenced a case in the Delhi high court, alleging that Sonia Gandhi became a voter before becoming Indian.Amit Shah offered a point-by-point rebuttal over the allegation of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi over vote theft in the Lok Sabha.During the ongoing debate on electoral reforms in the Parliament, Shah took a jibe at the Congress leader's ""nuclear bomb"" press conference said that his press conferences are not ""Constitutional provisions.""""Opposition Leader Rahul Gandhi dropped a “nuclear bomb” in a press conference on 5 November 2025. In that ‘nuclear bomb’, he claimed that 501 votes had been cast from a single house in Haryana. The Election Commission has clarified that House Number 265 is no small dwelling, but rather a joint residence for multiple families built on a one-acre ancestral plot,"" the home minister said.""However, separate house numbers have not been assigned to each family, so their house number is simply listed as 265. And in one of those families, three generations are living together. This numbering has been in place since the Congress government was elected in Haryana. It is neither a fake house nor fake votes,"" he added.Shah also said that it is unfair to blame the people who appear twice in the voter list.""Congress has claimed that some individuals are registered in two different locations on the electoral roll. It is unfair to blame the people who appear twice, as this is often a result of systemic issues. Since 2010, the Returning Officer's authority to remove duplicate entries has been revoked, which has led to such discrepancies.

Interpol Blue Notice Explained: How CBI Tracks Absconding Luthra Brothers In Goa Nightclub Fire Case

NEW DELHI:Goa police said the brothers purchased seats on a Phuket-bound flight at 1.17 am on December 7, even as firefighters and local authorities were struggling to contain the flames and rescue staff at Birch by Romeo Lane in Arpora, North Goa.By 5.30 am, they were airborne on IndiGo flight 6E-1073. Goa DGP Alok Kumar described their rapid exit as “a clear attempt to evade investigation.”In the days since, the brothers have approached a Delhi court seeking four weeks of transit anticipatory bail, claiming they left for Thailand for work purposes, not to slip away from the law. Filing their plea in Rohini court on Wednesday, they asserted through their counsel, “We want to come back,” and said they do not handle the nightclub’s daily operations.A beach shack owned by the brothers — who also run the Arpora club — is now set to be demolished, according to reports citing Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant.Despite their departure, Saurabh posted a message online expressing “profound grief” and “unwavering solidarity” with families of the victims. Soon after, the Bureau of Immigration issued Look Out Circulars for both men.A Goa police team reached Delhi on Sunday with an arrest warrant and searched their homes and offices but found no trace of them.Immigration officials in Mumbai later confirmed they had already left India. The court, meanwhile, declined to grant them interim relief and listed their anticipatory bail plea for Thursday.The investigation in Goa is underway. Four staff members of Birch, chief general manager Rajiv Modak, gate manager Priyanshu Thakur, bar manager Rajveer Singhania, and general manager Vivek Singh, have been arrested and remanded to six days' custody.

‘Days and nights have become the same for me’

I am extremely busy. I mean, what should I even tell you — there is a lot of pressure. Rita Mandal

Who said what

NEW DELHI: The Booth Level Officers (BLOs), who have been a silent and almost invisible part of India’s electoral machinery for decades, have suddenly found themselves at the centre of attention. The Election Commission ’s ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls has placed them at the centre of one of the largest verification drives in recent years, making their day-to-day labour impossible to ignore.What was once routine verification has now become a high-intensity, deadline-bound exercise. With the first phase scheduled to end on December 11, BLOs across West Bengal say they are clocking 12–16 hour days, making multiple visits to the same households, filling forms for those unable to do so, and uploading details late into the night on their phones. For many, the pressure has blurred the line between work and exhaustion, day and night.It is in this backdrop that The Times of India spoke to several BLOs in West Bengal to understand what the job looks like on the ground — the rush, the numbers, the fatigue, and the uneven experiences.“Pressure bahut zyada hai. Sabke andar ek tarah ka dar samaya hua hai (The pressure is extremely high. Everyone seems to be filled with fear),” said Chotelal Paswan, a Booth Level Officer, in conversation with TOI.Posted as a teacher in a middle school in West Bengal’s Bardhaman district, Chotelal is the sole breadwinner for a family of five. After being notified for BLO duty, he now leaves home every day at 8am and spends the entire day distributing and collecting forms. Once the field work ends, he uploads voters’ details, a process that often keeps him occupied till midnight.“The Election Commission informed us just four days before that we would be assigned this duty. Our training began two days before the work started. We receive instructions from the BDO office to begin data collection early in the morning. We carry forms and go door to door. If someone has already filled theirs, we collect it. After that, we have to submit a report to our supervisor mentioning how many forms were collected, how many were pending and how many death-related cases were found,” he said.“In a day, we are able to collect details of about 80–100 voters, that too if everyone is at home,” he added.Chotelal says delays on the ground often slow down the process. He frequently has to revisit houses, sometimes multiple times, and many voters aren’t aware of the urgency of the exercise.“We have to visit each house at least 5–6 times. Even then, many people who have filled their forms refuse to hand them over. They say, ‘Come after ten days,’ or ‘We are busy right now,’” he said.“This causes us a lot of trouble. Many people don’t understand the importance of this exercise. They say, ‘What difference will it make? We’ll give it later.’ But our official responsibility is to submit everything on time. For those who are not literate, we even have to fill out the forms ourselves,” he added.When asked whether there is pressure from political parties or senior officials, he paused before responding: “What can I say… this is an internal matter. But we are under so much pressure that we cannot speak freely. There is pressure from the BDO, pressure from the panchayat pradhan, pressure from the supervisor. On top of that, local party leaders and BLAs exert separate pressure. If we don’t follow their instructions, we fear consequences. ”He estimates that 30–40% of his work is still pending with the deadline looming. He is also required to attend school duties occasionally as examinations approach — despite the BLO Handbook 2011 stating that officers should be relieved of regular office responsibilities during revision periods.“So far, about 70% of the work is completed. We must submit the report by December 11. But if urgent work comes up in the school, I have to go there too,” he said.He also highlights the limitations of technology on the ground.“We work alone — one person has to collect data, upload it, categorise it and attach photographs. In terms of technology, all we have is a mobile phone. How much can we do?” he asked.“Most nights, it is 11pm or even midnight by the time we end our day's work and we are back in the field the next morning. Because of this, the error margin rises, almost up to 30%,” he added.On reports of BLOs allegedly dying by suicide due to work stress, he says the strain is visible around him.“In Bardhaman district, two women BLOs have committed suicide — we heard this from the news. The pressure is extremely high. Even yesterday, 2–4 women BLOs sitting with us were in very bad shape. Everyone seems to be filled with fear,” Chotelal said.“Everyone is scared. The workload is so heavy that sometimes responding properly becomes difficult. Yet the supervisor and BDO keep demanding answers. They tell us, ‘You must finish the work somehow,’” he added.Rita Mandal, a BLO posted in Kolkata’s Dumdum, says her routine has been consumed by SIR work since she was assigned duty. She admits that she has been working late nights under significant stress.“I am extremely busy. I mean, what should I even tell you — there is a lot of pressure,” she told The Times of India.“I have also been extremely busy at night. Because of this work, days and nights have become the same for me,” she said.In contrast, a BLO from Palpara Chandakh described a smoother experience, saying the workload was manageable in her area and that she received adequate support.“Look, this is not my personal work — this is government work. Everyone has a different experience, and my experience has been more or less good,” she said, requesting anonymity.She added that her supervisor and BDO had arranged an assistant BLO given the high voter density in her assigned area.“Our job was simply to distribute the forms, then collect them, and now I have submitted all the forms. There were a lot of voters, so the BDO office provided me with an assistant BLO. My supervisor and other seniors helped me a lot. We got so immersed in the work that we lost track of date and time. Training happened in phases, and whenever we faced difficulty, we called the BDO office and received immediate updates,” she said.She also denied reports of political pressure from local BLAs or party workers, adding that the BLAs in her area were helpful.“BLAs in my assigned area were very helpful. There were too many voters, and I could not know everyone personally, so they assisted in collecting forms and verifying addresses. The BLAs supported me throughout,” she said.Both the All India Trinamool Congress (AITC) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have acknowledged that BLOs are working under heavy strain. The BJP has alleged that BLOs are functioning under the threat and pressure of “TMC goons”, while the ruling TMC party in Bengal has blamed the Election Commission, calling the SIR timeline “inhuman” and “unplanned”.""Why are BLOs dying only in Mamata's Bengal? Because in Bengal, TMC goons threaten teachers, Anganwadi and ASHA workers: 'Finish the voter list fast or lose your job, face transfers, face violence'. The pressure is not from the ECI – it is from TMC’s terror mafia,"" BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya said.Meanwhile, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has argued that an exercise earlier spread across three years is now being compressed into two months “to please political masters”, thereby placing “inhuman pressure” on ground-level staff.“A process that earlier took three years is now being forced into two months on the eve of elections to please political masters, putting inhuman pressure on BLOs,” Mamata said.Whether the SIR will deliver a smoother voter list may take time to show.

NEW DELHI: A Maharastra MLA on Wednesday chose a unique way to present his stance in the state legislative assembly. Sharad Sonawane, the MLA from Junnar, arrived at the Maharashtra legislature dressed in a leopard-print outfit to protest the rising number of leopard-related incidents across the state.His demonstration came hours after a leopard in Nagpur’s Pardi area injured seven people before being captured by the forest department. On being asked by reporter about his dress-up, Sonawane said, ""An emergency should be declared for leopard attacks in the state. I have been raising this issue since 2014, but the government has kept ignoring me.""Further offering suggestions to deal with the issue, he added, ""Rescue centres should be made, and the leopards should be trapped and kept in the centres...""At Vidhan Bhavan, the Shiv Sena legislator said leopard attacks had claimed 55 lives in Junnar taluka of Pune district in the past three months. He said residents were living in constant fear and urged the state to set up rescue facilities capable of accommodating up to 2,000 leopards in both Junnar taluka and Ahilyanagar district.Additionally, responding to Forest Minister Ganesh Naik’s statement a day earlier that goats would be released in forests to divert leopards, Sonawane said the measure would not work, arguing that leopards increasingly occupy sugarcane fields and areas near human habitation.He demanded that the government declare a “state emergency” and initiate the capture of at least 2,000 leopards for placement in rescue centres.","Sharad Sonawane, the MLA from Junnar, arrived at the Maharashtra legislature dressed in a leopard-print outfit.

Cops to counter bail petition of Sharjeel today





NEW DELHI: Analysing the alleged inflammatory speeches of Sharjeel Imam, being prosecuted under UAPA in connection with the Northeast Delhi riots, Supreme Court said Tuesday his speech on blocking “Chicken’s Neck”, or Siliguri Corridor, was objectionable, but his lawyer pointed out other parts of the speech in which he appealed to protesters to adhere to the constitutional spirit and non-violence, and admitted that it could have been better-worded.Senior advocate Siddharth Dave, appearing for Sharjeel, also told the court that there was no credible evidence against him because of which he was rightly not made an accused in any one of the 750 cases related to the 2020 riots registered in the capital.Dave made the court hear other clippings of Sharjeel’s speeches in which he had appealed to people not to resort to violence while protesting.Dave contended that Sharjeel was being prosecuted in 10 different cases in different states arising out of his speeches and he had been granted bail in all the cases and cannot be prosecuted again under the anti-terror law. He told SC that he was already in custody when the riots broke out and there was no evidence against him as he was not associated with the rioters.“There is a legislation in Parliament. He was resisting the legislation. He is entitled to protest. Some of his speeches are unpalatable. It could have remained within the four corners of law. But today he is standing, asking for bail after six years in custody. He was not physically present or an accused in any of the cases when the riots actually took place,” he said.Dave also questioned why the govt did not bring NIA to probe the cases in view of Delhi Police’s allegation that it was an attempt for regime change. He concluded by quoting from a poem Faiz Ahmed Faiz penned during his incarceration in Pakistan: “Dil naummeed tou nahin nakaam hi to hai. Lambi hai gham ki shaam, magar shaam hi toh hai… (My heart is not unhopeful even if I have failed.

Shah counters Cong, lists 'vote chori' by Nehru, Indira, Sonia

NEW DELHI: Home minister Amit Shah Wednesday launched a sharp rebuttal to opposition's ""vote chori"" pitch, asserting that Congress's poll defeats stemmed from leadership failure rather than vote irregularities. Instead of introspection, he said, they were deflecting blame by peddling a false narrative of vote theft.""One day, Congress cadre will question their leadership,"" he said, intervening in the LS debate on poll reforms.Shah challenged LoP Rahul Gandhi's allegation that RSS had ""captured"" institutions, questioning - ""Is there a law in this country that bars a person with RSS ideology from holding constitutional posts? The PM is from RSS, and so is the home minister.""New Delhi: Intervening in the Lok Sabha debate on electoral reforms, Union home minister Amit Shah emphasised that RSS ideology was to live and die for the nation, to make Bharat more prosperous and stronger. Recalling his youth, he said, ""When I was 10 years old, I shouted slogans - 'Assam ki galiyan suni hain, Indira Gandhi khooni hai'.""He said that whenever the opposition faced a setback, it tries to shift the blame.""The people's mandate is the blessing of 'janta janardan', and dubbing the poll process as 'vote chori' is an insult to the country's voters, who are watching,"" Shah said.Delivering a point-by-point rebuttal to the opposition's charges, the home minister mounted a strong defence of the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls by EC. ""If someone asked a question in a press conference, they were labelled a BJP agent; if they (opposition) lost a court case, they accused the judge; and if they lost an election, they blamed EVMs. When the EVM narrative failed, they shifted to 'vote chori', and they still lost in Bihar. "" Enumerating what he called Congress's ""anti-people"" stand that led to its electoral decimation, Shah listed its objection to Article 370's abrogation, CAA, triple talaq abolition, surgical strikes, Ram Mandir construction, and now 'one nation one election' and SIR. ""This is why you lost election after election. Keep opposing SIR, you will be wiped out in West Bengal and TN too,"" hesaid.Shah cited the 1969 presidential polls, recalling how then-PM Indira Gandhi defied her party's decision and called for voting on ""antaratma ki awaaz"" as she supported V V Giri against official candidate Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy. ""Since Indira Gandhi's position in the party was precarious and Reddy had majority support, she took the communists' help and obliged them with appointments in key institutions. The country's institutions were diverted towards communist ideology by Indira Gandhi, which are being reformed by PM Modi since 2014. "" Shah said the opposition wanted to retain ""avaidh ghuspathiye (illegal immigrants)"" on the voter list, which was why they raised the SIR issue. Modi govt's policy, however, was clear - detect all aliens, delete their names from voter list and deport them.In his 90-minute speech, Shah provided a detailed rebuttal to opposition's charges on SIR. The session witnessed interruptions from Rahul, who challenged Shah to debate his three press conferences on ""vote chori"". This led to heated exchanges, culminating in an opposition walkout. Taking a swipe at Rahul's claim that ""they held only 33% influence"" in the collegium selecting election commissioners, Shah said, ""Those who draft your speech should work harder. You had 100% control earlier when your party was in power - the PM was the sole appointing authority, with no specific law. You should thank us for giving you 33% say now.""Addressing Rahul's query on deletion of CCTV footage after 45 days, Shah said, ""Common sense is not an injection. As per the Constitution, a writ petition challenging an election can be filed within 45 days. After that, keeping recordings serves no point. Besides, it's not possible to provide footage to anyone.""Shah said three instances of ""vote chori"" by Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi. ""Post-independence, Sardar Patel was backed by 28 persons, while Nehru was supported by two, yet Nehru became PM - this was vote chori,"" he said, adding the second was by Indira Gandhi, who granted herself immunity after a court set aside her election. The third dispute, he said, had reached civil courts regarding how Sonia Gandhi ""became a voter before becoming a citizen of India"" - a remark that drew sharp protests from Congress MPs. Shah accused the opposition of spreading falsehoods on SIR, asking whether democracy could be safe if PMs and CMs were decided by ""ghuspathiye"". Fiery exchanges ensued, with Rahul saying, ""Let us have a debate on my press conference. Shah ji, I challenge you to debate on the three pressers."" Shah said he would not frame his speech according to LoP's wishes or change its sequence on demand.Hailing Shah's speech in the Lok Sabha, PM Modi said on X: ""An outstanding speech by home minister Shri Amit Shah ji. With concrete facts, he has highlighted diverse aspects of our electoral process, the strength of our democracy and also exposed the lies of the Opposition.""","Home minister Amit Shah launched a sharp rebuttal to opposition's ""vote chori"" pitch.

Over 100 Opposition MPs Move to Remove Madras HC Judge GR Swaminathan

NEW DELHI: The Vishwa Hindu Parishad ’s (VHP) on Wednesday condemned attempts to “pressure the judiciary” and raised concerns over the status of religious minorities and the spread of jihadist ideology, as its two-day Kendriya Margdarshak Mandal (KMM) meeting concluded in the capital. Reference was also made to jihad as an ideological challenge beyond law-and-order.Amid growing political pushback against recent court verdicts touching on religious issues, the KMM objected to a proposal in Parliament, backed by the DMK and the Shiv Sena (Uddhav faction), to impeach Madras High Court judge Justice GR Swaminathan over a verdict seen as favouring Hindu interests, calling it an attempt to exert undue pressure on the judiciary.VHP international president Alok Kumar told reporters that 225 senior saints from across sects participated in the deliberations. On the question of minorities, Kumar said the Constitution grants special privileges to religious minorities but “does not define what constitutes a religious minority.” He pointed out that under the National Commission for Minorities Act, 1992, the Centre has the power to notify minorities.The Mandal, he said, holds the view that the term “religious minority” must be clearly defined, and that the issue should be debated to examine whether any religious community has historically faced persecution or social backwardness. Referring to census figures, Kumar said Muslims formed over 14% of the population in 2011 and that estimates now place it between 18–20%. “India is a secular country. Our Constitution rejects any discrimination on the basis of religion,” he said, questioning whether minority status should continue in such circumstances.On jihad, Kumar said investigations into the recent Red Fort blast showed the accused were “educated, from high-income groups, and socially well-established,” and claimed that a university had emerged as a centre for recruitment and indoctrination, with terror funding coming from abroad. He said jihad was rooted not in poverty but in “rigid religious fanaticism.”",The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) condemned attempts to “pressure the judiciary’ The VHP raised concerns over the status of religious minorities and the spread of jihadist ideology.

But, despite Guwahati police reaching out to them on social media for details, no response has been received so far.The woman, who described herself as a backpacking travel vlogger across Southeast Asia, posted a video on Instagram from a handle on Tuesday, claiming that she and her friend were targeted in the packed crowd.Guwahati’s joint commissioner of police Ankur Jain on Thursday said, “After we saw the Insta reel about the incident in the morning, we immediately sent messages to the two women on their X accounts, asking them for more details about the incident. We have not got any reply yet.”Jain said, “They have alleged harassment at the concert. Let me make it clear that on that day, there were adequate security personnel deployed. Upon examination, we found that not a single complaint has been lodged, and BookMyShow has also not received any. We had planned mechanisms to help women raise complaints, with signs even displayed at ladies’ toilets,” Jain said.He stressed that women’s safety is a top priority. “The Guwahati police give the highest priority to women’s safety, and there will be no compromise on it,” he added.In her post, she wrote, “Do you think concerts are a safe place for women in India? Last night at the Post Malone concert in Guwahati, things turned serious very quickly. As two women in the crowd ... were touched without consent within minutes of entering the packed area,”She added that within 10 minutes, they had to force their way out and move to the back near vendors because they no longer “felt safe”. She said, “Sadly, because of what happened, we were no longer able to enjoy the concert. This isn’t normal crowd pushing. It’s part of a wider issue of violence against women and the way harassment is minimised in public spaces.”“No concert, no matter how big, should make women choose between enjoying the music and guarding their bodies,” she added.The tourist, who appears to be from Bangkok as per her social media account, clarified that the incident was not a reflection of Guwahati as a whole. “We met countless people last night who were lovely, respectful, and excited to share the moment. But it only takes a small number of men acting without respect or consent to ruin an entire experience and create an environment of fear. Women deserve to feel safe.

How the market reacted?





The United States seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, President Donald Trump announced Wednesday, marking a dramatic escalation in his administration’s pressure campaign against Nicolás Maduro, the leader of Venezuela.“As you probably know, we have just seized a tanker off the coast of Venezuela, a large tanker, very large, the largest one ever seized, actually,” Trump said during a White House event on a new luxury visa programme.Trump declined to say who owned the tanker. But when asked about the ship’s oil, he said: “Well, we keep it, I guess.”Meanwhile, hours after Trump's statement, Attorney General Pam Bondi shared a video in a post in X and said that the government executed a seizure warrant on a tanker headed from Venezuela and Iran.""Today, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Homeland Security Investigations, and the United States Coast Guard, with support from the Department of War, executed a seizure warrant for a crude oil tanker used to transport sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran.""""For multiple years, the oil tanker has been sanctioned by the United States due to its involvement in an illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organizations.This seizure, completed off the coast of Venezuela, was conducted safely and securely—and our investigation alongside the Department of Homeland Security to prevent the transport of sanctioned oil continues,"" she added.A video posted by Bondi showed armed operators descending ropes from helicopters onto the deck of the vessel before entering what appeared to be the bridge.The reports came two days after Trump declined to rule out deploying troops in an interview with POLITICO.In the interview, Trump repeatedly declined to rule out sending troops to bring down Maduro, whom he accused of exporting drugs and criminals to the United States.Since then, the administration restored sanctions, bolstered the US military presence in the Caribbean and used lethal force against vessels it alleged were trafficking drugs in concert with the Venezuelan military. Officials said the measures aimed to pressure Maduro to cede power to the opposition.According to the NBC, as soon as the reports being circulated online, the oil prices began steadily rising, climbing more than 1.3% or about 75 cents, as of 3:45 p.m. ET.US crude prices jumped 1 percent Wednesday afternoon, to just under $59 a barrel.As per the reports from Politico, the seizure could put pressure on shippers to stop taking Venezuelan crude, potentially tightening global oil supplies. U.S. crude prices jumped 1 percent Wednesday afternoon, to just under $59 a barrel.Trump, who has repeatedly pointed to declining gasoline prices amid voters’ complaints about the rising cost of living, repeated his claim Wednesday that gasoline prices had dropped to $1.99 a gallon, though data collected by the American Automobile Association put the national average slightly below $3 per gallon.","The United States seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, President Donald Trump announced Wednesday.

Parent says leaders ignored warnings as Travis Turner vanished



A leaked email has shaken a Virginia school district, as a mom says the system failed to protect kids while fugitive football coach and P.E. teacher Travis Turner remains missing. Travis Turner went missing on November 20 from his home in Appalachia, Virginia, just before police reached his door. His family told officers he left with a gun and walked into a “heavily wooded and mountainous area. ”Days later, he was charged with 10 counts of child pornography and solicitation of a minor. Police, the FBI, and the U.S. Marshals Service are still searching for him. The leaked email, first seen by the Daily Mail , says there are “systemic issues” in Wise County Public Schools. The mom wrote that she is “heartbroken and angry” and wants “action and answers.” She also said some school leaders “swept under the rug” past reports of misconduct.In the email, the mom told school board chair Larry Greear and a state lawmaker that the district allowed a “culture to develop, and in most cases, thrive.” She also said there were claims that school leaders knew about the accusations against Turner but did not report them within 24 hours, which is required by Virginia law.Her email said, “These patterns point to a systemic issue that can no longer be ignored.”She added, “As a parent, I am heartbroken and angry. I am asking for answers, for action, and for assurance that our schools will no longer be a place where misconduct is ignored or concealed.” The Daily Mail said school officials have not replied to its repeated questions.At the first board meeting since Turner disappeared, parents were shocked to see that public comment was removed from the agenda. One parent told News 5 they were “aggravated and concerned” by the lack of information.School officials also refused to answer questions about whether Union High School principal Jerred Chandler had been placed on leave.Wise County Public Schools later posted a statement saying they “take all matters involving student safety seriously” but cannot share details because of “personnel issues and ongoing law-enforcement activity.”Travis Turner worked at the school for 14 years. There have been no sightings of him since he vanished. His wife, Leslie, told the Daily Mail, “None of that is true. He’s a good dad and a good husband and we want him home.” Police say the search is still active and are asking the public for any tips.Also Read: Furious Parents Demand Answers As School Stays Silent On Missing Football Coach Travis Turner Child Abuse Charges","Leaked email claims missing football coach Travis Turner case was hidden and sparks big questions in Wise County Public Schools.

Stating that LOCs have been opened against the Luthras, the senior counsel said, “I just want to come back and take my legal remedies. My learned friend (state counsel) surely cannot oppose my legal remedies.”The court has sought a response from Goa Police and granted time to file a reply. The matter will be taken up tomorrow at noon.Meanwhile, a beach shack owned by the brothers who also operate the Arpora nightclub, where a devastating fire killed 25 people last week, is set to be demolished, according to several reports quoting Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant.Officials said bulldozers will raze 'Romeo Lane' in Vagator, after the restaurant, allegedly constructed on government-owned land, was sealed by authorities.The investigation continues to focus on the tragic fire at 'Birch by Romeo Lane'. Addressing allegations of police negligence, Goa DIG Varsha Sharma said, ""We have coordinated with the CBI and Interpol. A Blue Corner Notice has also been issued.""According to police sources, on December 7, within hours of the deadly blaze, Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra boarded a flight from Delhi to Phuket, Thailand. Interpol has issued a Blue Corner Notice against both brothers to help locate and provisionally detain them pending extradition proceedings.Goa Police on Wednesday brought Ajay Gupta, one of the four owners of the 'Birch by Romeo Lane' nightclub, to the Sunlight Colony Crime Branch office in connection with the recent North Goa fire tragedy that claimed 25 lives at the restaurant-cum-bar.Gupta is presented in court today as part of the ongoing investigation.The development comes days after the massive blaze broke out in the early hours of Sunday at a nightclub in Arpora, triggering a high-casualty incident and killing at least 25 people, most of whom were staff of the restaurant. The Government of Goa formed a committee to investigate the incident.A Lookout Circular (LOC) had earlier been issued against Gupta. When the police team visited his residence in Delhi, he was found to be absconding; a non-bailable arrest warrant was subsequently issued against him.The district administration demolished part of the Romeo Lane restaurant in Vagator, Goa. The restaurant is owned by Gaurav Luthra and Saurabh Luthra, who also own Birch by Romeo Lane.The brothers fled to Thailand after the fire, which claimed 25 lives, and are now being tracked by international authorities.","Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, owners of Birch by Romeo Lane have approached a Delhi court seeking four weeks of transit anticipatory bail.

The party is Goa’s oldest regional political outfit.“Nightclubs do not sync with Goa’s culture. It is the worst culture. Nightclubs should be stopped,” MGP president Deepak ‘Pandurang’ Dhavalikar said.Dhavalikar said that it is his personal opinion and the same would be discussed at the MGP meeting.The culture of pubs, swimming in bikinis on beaches, massage parlours, and illegal casinos is against ‘Bharatiya saunskruti’ (Indian culture) and should be banned, then PWD minister Ramkrishna ‘Sudin Dhavalikar had said in 2014.On Wednesday, Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant had convened a high-level meeting with senior officials and key tourism stakeholders to reinforce safety measures ahead of the upcoming Christmas and New Year season.During the meeting, the government issued strict directives to prevent any repeat of the tragedy.Licences of tourist establishments in Goa that lacked fire safety compliance were set to be cancelled. The government also prohibited the sale of liquor after 11 pm across the state to curb late-night violations. Tourists were advised to avoid swimming in danger zones, particularly along beaches identified as high-risk by lifeguard agencies. While the tourism season was to continue as planned, it was to operate under heightened monitoring and stricter compliance checks.Six people had been arrested in connection with the Arpora nightclub fire as authorities intensified their crackdown on illegal operations and safety lapses.Officials said the government would conduct surprise inspections of nightclubs, shacks, and high-footfall venues while reviewing all licences and safety certifications to ensure full compliance.The meeting was held against the backdrop of the December 6 fire at the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub in Arpora, North Goa, which claimed 25 lives, according to sources.“The chief minister briefed those present at the meeting about various measures taken to ensure such a tragedy did not recur in the state,” a senior officer privy to the meeting said.He added that the state government had issued multiple orders and formed committees, including a high-level magisterial inquiry panel and a fire safety audit committee, after the incident.“The chief minister ordered all departments to ensure there was no laxity, especially considering Goa would be seeing a large number of tourists during the Christmas and New Year festivities,” the officer said.(With agency inputs)","BJP’s coalition partner in the government, the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP), on Wednesday called for the closure of all nightclubs in the state.

Mizoram council election: Single paper ballot carried for 40km to keep lone voter’s choice secret; EVM could reveal it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/mizoram-polls-officials-carry-single-paper-ballot-for-40km-to-keep-lone-voters-choice-secret-evm-could-reveal-it/articleshow/125902232.cms,"AIZAWL: One voter and the paradox of the secret vote. In a remote border village in Mizoram’s far south where refugees outnumber locals, the electorate narrowed to just one name. With it came a strange tension—an EVM would expose the only voter’s hand, forcing an extraordinary workaround. Officials carried a single paper ballot so the voter could keep his choice private.The polling station in Hmawngbuchhuah village along the Myanmar frontierhad only one eligible voter— Lalsangbera—for the Lai Autonomous District Council (LADC) elections on Dec 3. Casting his choice on an EVM would have revealed his preference. EVMs display candidate-wise totals at each polling station and one vote is too visible to hide. The machine would have broadcast his choice. To preserve confidentiality, he chose a postal ballot—pooled and counted centrally. That decision set off a 40-km journey from Lawngtlai town as nodal officer Lalnunpuia and security personnel travelled to the village on Nov 29, DC Donny Lalruatsanga said. Lalsangbera marked his ballot from home.Hmawngbuchhuah had 389 residents in the 2011 census. Today, most are refugeesfrom Paletwa in southern Chin state of Myanmar—locally called Zakhai or Rakhine. Nearly all are ineligible to vote because of their refugee status. In the draft electoral rolls for LADC polls, four people sought scheduled tribe status that would have allowed them to vote. Only Lalsangbera qualified as a voter.The village’s demographic story is shaped by turmoil across the border. Since 2017, around 300 people from Paletwa and other areas fled to Hmawngbuchhuah after armed clashes in Myanmar and refused to return.","The polling station in Hmawngbuchhuah village along the Myanmar frontier had only one eligible voter.

A parent of a Kentucky State University student was charged with murder and first-degree assault after an on-campus shooting at the school’s Frankfort campus on Tuesday that killed one student and critically injured another.Jacob Lee Bard, 48, was at the campus and fired shots at victims in Whitney M. Young Jr. Hall, police said in a statement. The shooting killed 19-year-old De’Jon Fox of Indianapolis. A second student remains in critical condition; his name was not released, CNN reported.Police said Bard is from Evansville, Indiana, which is about 150 miles west of Frankfort. He was booked into the Franklin County Jail on charges of murder and first-degree assault. Bard is represented by a public defender at the Franklin County Department of Public Advocacy, which declined to comment on the case.University police officers who were near the scene of the altercation arrested Bard immediately, investigators said. Surveillance footage and videos taken by others at the scene have been reviewed.When asked about reports that videos show a fight involving Bard’s sons before the shooting, or whether Bard came to campus to speak to administrators about his sons’ safety, Frankfort Assistant Police Chief Scott Tracy said: “It’s really too early in the investigation right now to really give any details that led up to it.A lot of it would be speculation.”This was the second shooting in four months near the student residence. On August 17 someone fired multiple shots from a vehicle, striking two people who were not students. One victim was treated for minor injuries and the other sustained serious injuries. The dorm and at least one vehicle were damaged by gunfire.University President Koffi C. Akakpo said at a news conference: “The campus is a safe place.” He added that the school had increased the number of police officers after the first shooting and would decide whether further measures were needed once the investigation into the latest incident was complete.Kentucky State University, a public historically Black university with about 2,200 students, was created in 1886.

Zelensky’s ‘Difficult Call’ With US Envoys As Territory Talks Hit Wall | 3-day Miami Talks Conclude

Who is Eileen Higgins ?









Miami voters have elected Democrat Eileen Higgins as the city’s first female mayor and the first Democrat to hold the office in nearly three decades.In Tuesday’s runoff, Higgins, a former county commissioner, defeated Republican Emilio González, a former city manager backed by former President Donald Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.“Together, we turned the page on years of chaos and corruption and opened the door to a new era for our city, one defined by ethical, accountable leadership that delivers real results for the people,"" Higgins said in a statement after the voivtory, promising to lead a government “that finally earns the public’s trust,” as cited by NYT.Although Miami’s elections are officially nonpartisan, both major parties played an active role in the campaign. US President Donald Trump endorsed González, while the Democratic National Committee backed Higgins. In the days leading up to the vote, several prominent national Democrats traveled to Miami to campaign alongside her, an unusual show of support for a low-turnout, off-year local election.Higgins secured victory the victory after topping the first round of voting on November 4, where she received 35 per cent of the vote compared to González’s 19 per cent.Higgins will make history as Miami’s first female mayor and its first non-Hispanic mayor since the 1990s, breaking a three-decade dominance of Cuban American Republicans in city politics.Higgins, a trained mechanical engineer and former Peace Corps director in Belize, previously represented what she described as a Republican-leaning district on the county commission.She also holds a Master of Business Administration from Cornell University’s Johnson Graduate School of Management.On the campaign trail, she pledged to focus on addressing residents’ everyday concerns if elected, as cited by Politico.Higgins had served as a well-known county commissioner for eight years, representing a district that included Miami’s downtown. In the November 4 election, she also secured the top spot across all five of the city’s commission districts.She received a social media endorsement from former transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg, who is a former mayor and was a 2020 presidential candidate.She also led in all five of the city’s commission districts and will succeed outgoing Mayor Francis Suarez, who had briefly sought the Republican presidential nomination, as cited by the NYT.Miami, home to roughly half a million residents, is Florida’s second-largest city after Jacksonville. While the city, like the state, has trended Republican in recent election cycles, Higgins’ Democratic victory stands out as particularly notable.","Eileen Higgins, a former county commissioner, defeated Republican Emilio González in Tuesday's runoff.

Biggest ever US travel ban in the works?

The United States is planning to expand the number of countries that were covered by its travel ban - and the new list may include over 30 countries.US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, on Thursday, during an interview on Fox News’ The Ingraham Angle, when asked whether President Donald Trump’s administration would increase the number to 32, she said “I won’t be specific on the number, but it’s over 30, and the president is continuing to evaluate countries. ""In June, Trump signed a proclamation banning citizens of 12 countries from entering the United States and restricting those from seven others, saying it was needed to protect against “foreign terrorists” and other security threats, Reuters reported.The bans applied to both immigrants and non-immigrants, such as tourists, students and business travellers.Noem did not specify which countries would be added to the list. “If they don’t have a stable government there, if they don’t have a country that can sustain itself and tell us who those individuals are and help us vet them, why should we allow people from that country to come here to the United States?” she said.Reuters previously reported that the Trump administration was considering banning citizens of 36 additional countries from entering the United States, according to an internal State Department cable.An expansion of the list would mark a further escalation of migration measures the administration had taken since the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, DC, last week.Investigators said the shooting was carried out by an Afghan national who entered the US in 2021 through a resettlement programme under which Trump administration officials have argued there was insufficient vetting. Days after the shooting, Trump vowed to “permanently pause” migration from all “Third World Countries,” although he did not identify any by name or define “third-world countries.”Prior to that, officials from the Department of Homeland Security said Trump had ordered a widespread review of asylum cases approved under the administration of his predecessor, Democratic President Joe Biden, and Green Cards issued to citizens of 19 countries. Since returning to office in January, Trump has aggressively prioritised immigration enforcement, sending federal agents to major US cities and turning away asylum seekers at the US-Mexico border. His administration has frequently highlighted the deportation push, but until now it has put less emphasis on efforts to reshape legal immigration.","US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the president is 'continuing to evaluate countries' In June, President Donald Trump signed a proclamation banning citizens of 12 countries from entering the United States.

Survivors were in 'clear distress'

Survivors were trying to 'stay in the fight'

Trump says Pete 'didn't know what people were talking about'





Two people who survived the September 2nd US strike on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean were seen waving before they were killed in a second follow-up strike, sources familiar with a video shown to lawmakers revealed.One source said the gestures could be interpreted as the survivors either calling for help or surrendering to avoid another strike.The operation was the first of more than 20 US attacks on suspected drug-carrying vessels under the Trump administration. The GOP leader has defended the campaign as a necessary way to curb narcotics trafficking. However, the premise remains legally questionable. The Pentagon has reported that more than 80 people have died in these strikes, including 11 in the initial September 2 attack.Members of Congress were shown video of the strikes, including the follow-up attack that killed the two survivors, during a closed-door briefing with the operation's commander, Adm. Mitch Bradley, and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine, according to CBS News.Democratic Representative Jim Himes of Connecticut described the scene as one of the most difficult things hes ever seen in his life. He said the survivors appeared “in clear distress without any means of locomotion.”Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas defended the strikes. He said the survivors were “trying to flip a boat loaded with drugs bound for the United States back over so they could stay in the fight” and clarified that the strikes were “entirely lawful and needful.”US President Donald Trump hinted he would support releasing the video to the public, but denied knowledge of any order given to target survivors. “I don't know that that happened. And Pete said he did not want that — he didn't even know what people were talking about. We'll look into it. But no, I wouldn't have wanted that. Not a second strike,” he said.Trump has also said that Venezuela’s airspace should now be considered “closed” amid rising tensions.Defensed department officials have defended the operations as legal and necessary. Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell told The Washington Post that “ongoing operations to dismantle narcoterrorism and to protect the Homeland from deadly drugs have been a resounding success.”Defense secretary Pete Hegseth said the strikes were “lethal, kinetic strikes” aimed at stopping drug trafficking and destroying vessels affiliated with “Designated Terrorist Organisations.”Legal experts and lawmakers have expressed concern that targeting survivors could constitute a war crime.","Survivors seen waving before they were killed in a second follow-up strike.

Renewed border fighting between Thailand and Cambodia showed no signs of abating Wednesday, with hundreds of thousands of displaced people in strained conditions as more flooded into temporary shelters. The fighting triggered by longstanding territorial disputes followed a skirmish Sunday that derailed a ceasefire pushed by US President Donald Trump that ended five days of combat in July.

US President Donald Trump ’s department of govt efficiency (DOGE) was only “a little bit successful”, Tesla CEOsaid on a podcast on Tuesday, adding that he would not lead the project again.The billionaire was a major donor to Trump’s election campaign and became a close ally and adviser to his administration.He led the DOGE team in seeking to slash the federal govt’s budget and workforce in the first five months of Trump’s second term. But the role and his political rhetoric sparked a backlash against him and Tesla, including vandalism of Tesla cars.“I think instead of doing DOGE, I would have basically worked on my companies. And they wouldn’t have been burning the cars,” Musk said on the podcast. “We were a little bit successful. We were somewhat successful. We stopped a lot of funding that really just made no sense, that was entirely wasteful,” Musk said. Asked if he would go back and lead DOGE again, Musk said: “No, I don’t think so.”Musk’s work for DOGE also sparked concerns among investors that he was not paying enough attention to Tesla as it faced slowing sales.

WASHINGTON:





A US trade agreement reached with Indonesia in July is at risk of collapsing because Jakarta has backtracked on several commitments it made as part of the deal, a US official said on Tuesday.“They’re reneging on what we agreed to in July,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, giving no details about which specific commitments Indonesia was now questioning. Asked about the comments, Indonesian officials said on Wednesday that the talks between two sides are still ongoing, with no specific issues arising during negotiations.“Dynamics in the negotiation process are normal.The Indonesian govt hopes that an agreement can be reached soon that is beneficial to both parties,” said Haryo Limanseto, a spokesperson for Indonesia’s ministry for economic affairs.The two countries in July said Indonesia agreed to eliminate tariffs on more than 99% of US goods and scrap all non-tariff barriers facing American firms, while the US will drop threatened tariffs on Indonesian products to 19% from 32%. But Indonesian officials have told US trade representative Jamieson Greer that Jakarta cannot agree to some binding commitments and wants to reframe them, the US official said.","Jakarta has backtracked on several commitments it made as part of the deal, a US official said.

CIA pressure tactics revisited amid renewed scrutiny

Social media reactions

“Couple of agents who couldn’t be blackmailed are spilling the beans on Brennan.”

“Epstein and Brennan – bread and butter.”

“This guy and all like him belong in prison.”

“I don’t understand this story, because blackmailing people seems like his favorite thing to do based on his actions.”

“The semantic restructuring of ‘blackmail’ into ‘national security’ is a clear example of linguistic compartmentalization used to justify non-ethical control mechanisms.”

“If you quit spying for them, then they use the evidence that you spied for them to put you in prison.”

“Anybody ever watch American Made? Seems to confirm these sorts of tactics. And they hung Barry Seals out to dry.”

“CIA blackmail? John Brennan says it’s ‘national security,’ not blackmail.”

“Shouldn’t the CIA be abolished after the abhorrences and illegal activities it has done?”

“That dude is the best blackmailer of all, right up there with Epstein… no doubt!”





A resurfaced interview with former CIA Director John Brennan has gone viral after he described how CIA instructors used financial leverage to pressure foreign agents into continued espionage. Brennan recalled being told during training that reminding agents of money they had accepted from the agency, often at the point of recruitment, could be used to “scare” them into continuing their work. Instructors defended the tactic as essential to national security rather than a form of blackmail.The viral clip features Brennan recounting how he questioned the ethics of such methods, only to be told that “it’s not blackmail” because the tactics served the security interests of the United States. He explained that agents often sign documents acknowledging CIA payments, and instructors said this acknowledgement could later be used to keep them cooperating if they hesitated or attempted to leave.The approach Brennan described resembles methods discussed in declassified CIA training materials, such as the 1983 Human Resource Exploitation Training Manual, which outlines how financial and other dependencies can influence agent compliance without overt coercion. This serves as a contextual comparison, not a documented link between Brennan’s specific training scenario and that manual. The manual is no longer in use but remains central to debates about intelligence-agency conduct and the ethical boundaries of recruitment and control.",A resurfaced interview with former CIA Director John Brennan has gone viral after he described how CIA instructors used financial leverage to pressure foreign agents into continued espionage. Brennan recalled being told during training that reminding agents of money they had accepted from the agency could be used to “scare” them into continuing their work. The approach resembles methods discussed in declassified CIA training materials.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125897669,imgsize-29214,width-400,resizemode-4/its-not-blackmail-former-cia-director-reveals-how-cia-scares-spies-to-keep-working-old-clip-goes-viral.jpg"

'Execute Tomorrow...': Candace Owens Claims Charlie Kirk Sent Alarming Texts Before Assassination





Erika Kirk was seen furious as she addressed the unrelenting rumors going on about Charlie Kirk 's assassination. Though Erika did not name Candace Owens, her target was clear as Candace has not wasted a day since Kirk's assassination to spin conspiracy theories about Kirk's assassination. And most of the theories suggested that Kirk's murder was an inside job.Erika said on Fox News she believes in the judicial system of the country and does not want someone to making hundreds of thousands of dollars every single episode going after the Turning Point USA family.“I do not have time to address the noise,” said Kirk. “My silence does not mean that I am complacent. My silence does not mean that somehow Turning Point USA and all of the handpicked staff that loved my husband and my husband loved them is somehow in on it. We are busy building. And you know what I thought? I thought these people are human. We are all grieving in our own way. And they are trying to find the answer to something that happened that was so evil. They are trying so hard. And I get that. We’re doing the same … No rock will be unturned. I want justice for my husband, for myself, for my family more than anyone else out there.""Come after me, call me names, I don't care. Call me what you want, go down that rabbit hole, whatever.But ... when you go after the people that I love and you're making hundreds of thousands of dollars every single episode going after the people that I love because somehow they're in on this? No,"" Erika said adding that the team members saw Charlie being killed in front of their eyes and now they are being hounded every single day.As Erika burst out in anger, Fox host Harris Faulkner said she had never seen Erika like this. ""This is righteous anger because this is not okay, it's not healthy. This is a mind virus.""This is a duty to my husband, and it's an absolute honor. And I will never back down. And so my message to them is to stop - to stop.""Candace Owens who claims to be a friend of late Charlie Kirk said Tyler Robinson who was arrested on charges of killed Kirk was not the murderer. She initially suggested there was Israeli role in Charlie Kirk's murder, then claimed French government had a role and her latest claim is that Charlie Kirk's organization betrayed him and US military had a role.",'Execute Tomorrow...': Candace Owens Claims Charlie Kirk Sent Alarming Texts Before Assassination.

Calls To ‘Send Usha Back’ Erupt After JD Vance’s Immigration Remark Sparks Fierce National Outrage

Why the rumour spread so quickly

The couple’s response

Verdict





A photo circulating online recently ignited rumours that US Vice President JD Vance and his wife, Usha Vance, had a public argument in a restaurant. The image appeared to show a tense exchange between a man resembling Vance and a woman with her head turned away. Within hours, social platforms filled with speculation about the couple’s marriage, but the vice president himself shut the rumour down.JD Vance addressed the photo directly, dismissing it with sarcasm. “I always wear an undershirt when I go out in public to have a fight loudly with my wife,” he wrote on X, mocking the idea that the image represented a real incident. His remark emphasised that the picture, which circulated widely over the weekend, does not depict an actual argument between him and Usha.The photo had been shared by Thomas Clay Jr., an online political influencer, who claimed it showed the couple in a heated exchange. Clay later said he did not create the image. Independent AI image detection tools flagged the picture as likely fabricated, and no witness accounts or verifiable evidence place JD and Usha Vance in such a confrontation.Speculation about the couple had been simmering for months. In October, JD Vance drew attention after expressing his hope that Usha, who is Hindu, would eventually share his Christian faith.The remark sparked debate and fuelled scrutiny of their relationship. Shortly afterwards, Usha was photographed without her wedding ring, prompting further online chatter.Vance has said the couple is unbothered by the speculation and even finds some of it amusing. He explained that Usha simply forgot her ring in the rush of leaving for the White House, adding that they expected online rumours to erupt but chose not to let it disrupt their routine.According to Vance, he and Usha are focused on their young family, three children aged 3, 5 and 8, and have no interest in entertaining baseless gossip. He noted that the viral cycle surrounding the supposed restaurant incident was “kind of funny” to them, reinforcing his stance that the photo is not real and that the marriage remains stable.There is no credible evidence that JD and Usha Vance had a public argument in a restaurant. The image fueling the rumour appears to be AI generated, and JD Vance himself has clearly denied the incident. With no verifiable footage, witnesses or reliable details to support the claim, the story remains nothing more than an online fabrication amplified by pre-existing speculation about the couple.","US Vice President JD Vance and his wife, Usha Vance, have been the subject of rumours about their marriage.

Pakistan Army Spokesperson Faces Backlash for Winking at Reporter in Viral Video





Pakistan’s military spokesperson Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry has come under widespread criticism after he appeared to wink at a journalist following her question about imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan In the video, the reporter questions Chaudhry about the allegations against Khan, referring to him as a “national security threat” and “anti-state.”""How is it different from the past, or should we expect any development in the future?"" the journalist added.To this, the Chaudhary replied, ""and add a fourth point that you are missing: he is also a 'zehni mareez' (mental patient)."" Chaudhary then proceeded to smile and wink at the journalist.The video, now circulating widely on social media, has sparked widespread criticism, with users calling the gesture “shameless.”""This is how corrupt Pakistani military officers treats women... shameless!!"" a user on X said.Last week, Chaudhry criticised the imprisoned former prime minister, calling him “a mentally ill person,” “a narcissist,” and “a security risk,” while noting that it was for the government to determine how to deal with him, as cited by Dawn.During an hour-long media briefing, Chaudhry acknowledged that the military had never before taken such a clear public stance on a political leader, calling the move “unprecedented.”Chaudhry’s strongly worded press briefing came in response to Khan’s latest remarks against the military leadership, conveyed earlier this week through his sister, Uzma Khan, during a jail visit after weeks of limited access. The comments were later shared on Khan’s X account. Uzma told reporters that her brother was in good health but “very angry.”Imran Khan is currently lodged in Adiala Jail, where he was first sentenced to three years in prison in August 2023 in the Al-Qadir Trust case. Subsequent corruption convictions have extended his total jail term to 14 years, the longest imposed on him to date.Meanwhile, Pakistani government officials have dismissed rumours of Khan’s death in custody or a secret transfer from Adiala Jail, maintaining that he remains in the Rawalpindi facility and is in stable condition.","Pakistan Army Spokesperson Faces Backlash for Winking at Reporter in Viral Video.

Pak President Zardari Approves Asim Munir As The First Chief Of Defence Forces Amid Power Tensions





Pakistan’s defence ministry on Friday officially notified the appointment of Field Marshal Asim Munir as the country’s first Chief of Defence Forces (CDF).The ""president, on the advice of the prime minister, is pleased to appoint Field Marshal Asim Munir (NI) M as the chief of army staff, concurrently the chief of defence forces for a tenure of five years,” the notification read, news agency PTI reported citing Dawn.This comes a day after President Asif Ali Zardari approved his appointment on the advice of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.According to the notification issued under Article 243 of Pakistan’s Constitution and the amended Pakistan Army Act, Munir will serve concurrently as Chief of Army Staff and Chief of Defence Forces for a tenure of five years. The notification marks the most significant restructuring of Pakistan’s military command since the 1970s.The appointment follows the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment last month, which created the new CDF post to establish a unified command structure and enable faster decision-making in critical situations.The amendment also abolished the office of the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), which had coordinated the tri-services since 1976. The CJCSC post formally ended on November 27 following the retirement of General Sahir Shamshad Mirza.With the restructuring, operational, administrative and strategic authority of the armed forces has been consolidated into a single office headed by the CDF. The revised Article 243 provides that the president, acting on the prime minister’s advice, will appoint the army chief, who will concurrently serve as the CDF.Munir was first appointed Army Chief in November 2022 for three years. His tenure was extended to five years in 2024 after amendments to the Pakistan Army Act.He was promoted to the rank of Field Marshal days after the four-day conflict with India in May, becoming only the second officer in Pakistan’s history to hold the rank after Field Marshal Ayub Khan.Alongside Munir’s notification, the defence ministry also confirmed a two-year extension for Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu. His extended tenure as Chief of the Air Staff will begin in March 2026 and continue till March 2028.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif congratulated Munir on his “historic” appointment, saying his leadership had been pivotal in guiding Pakistan’s armed forces. He also praised the air chief for his command during recent operations. defence minister Khawaja Asif and other senior leaders also extended their congratulations, according to Dawn.Information minister Attaullah Tarar said Pakistan’s defence had strengthened with the establishment of a unified command. Dismissing speculation over the delay in the notification, he said rumours circulating on social and electronic media had proven baseless.Earlier uncertainty had followed the abolition of the CJCSC post and the end of Munir’s original three-year term in late November, leading to political speculation over upcoming four-star appointments. Government officials maintained that the delay was procedural and linked to the prime minister’s travel schedule.Explaining the significance of the new post, army spokesman Lt General Ahmad Sharif Chaudhry said the CDF headquarters would improve coordination across modern, multi-domain warfare involving land, sea, air, cyber, space and intelligence operations. He added that many countries already operate under similar unified command structures.Under the amended military laws, the five-year tenure of the first COAS-plus-CDF is deemed to begin from the date of notification, effectively resetting Munir’s term. The law also allows future reappointments or extensions of up to five years, creating the legal framework for continuity in leadership.The next major step under the new structure will be the appointment of the Commander of the National Strategic Command (NSC), a four-star position responsible for strategic assets. The NSC commander will be appointed by the prime minister on the recommendation of the CDF.Meanwhile, law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said the defence ministry is finalising a new organogram for the CDF to clearly define command flows between the CDF, the service chiefs and the newly created strategic command.Politically, the 27th Constitutional Amendment has drawn mixed reactions. While the ruling coalition hailed it as a step towards efficiency and national security, opposition leaders warned that it concentrates excessive power in the military and could weaken democratic and provincial autonomy.",Pak President Zardari Approves Asim Munir As The First Chief Of Defence Forces.

Pak President Zardari Approves Asim Munir As The First Chief Of Defence Forces Amid Power Tensions

Why Imran Khan still remains a threat to Asim Munir





PTI without Imran: Still a major force





PTI was barred from contesting the 2024 general elections.

Dozens of PTI leaders were detained.

PTI-backed independents still won more seats than any other group.

Popularity that has not faded





A 2023 Gallup Pakistan survey showed 61% of Pakistanis had a “good opinion” of him -- the highest rating among all national leaders as reported by Dawn.

Arab News quoted analysts saying Khan remains ""too politically relevant to sideline.""

Televised appearances that trigger unrest





Nationwide protests

Arson and clashes

Attacks on military installations, including the Corps Commander’s residence in Lahore

Nationwide mobile shutdowns and troop deployment

Why Pak army cannot 'eliminate' Imran Khan





Key factors keeping Khan politically alive:





Victimhood narrative: Solitary confinement and restricted access cast him as a political prisoner, a powerful image in Pakistan’s grievance-driven politics.

Mobilisation without presence: PTI’s digital machinery enables mass mobilisation even without Khan physically present.

Diaspora and social media influence: Global PTI networks amplify every statement, intensifying scrutiny on Pakistan’s military.

High-risk optics: Every court appearance or televised moment risks sparking unrest.

The state vs sentiment





The jail sentence - not the silence





Constitutional shift and expanding military power





Munir's foreign outreach and US engagement





Imran's strength: Mobilisation without access





Why the military needs more than power









Is Imran Khan still a threat to Asim Munir ? The question looms over Pakistan ’s power structure. Former Prime Minister and cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan, now over two years into imprisonment, remains a potent challenge to army chief Asim Munir — whose rapid ascent and consolidation of authority have made him Pakistan’s de facto ruler.With Munir now elevated as the Pakistan's first chief of defence forces, commanding the army, navy and air force, his institutional power is at its strongest — yet the confrontation with Khan, even from behind bars, continues to shadow that authority. The two have been locked in a prolonged, deeply personal confrontation.Despite being confined, Khan has transformed from a jailed political leader into a symbolic and political counterweight to Munir’s expanding military-political dominance.Far from fading, the rivalry between the two men has only sharpened. Munir commands the state; Khan commands sentiment. And as the events of the last two years show, sentiment can be far harder to control.Imran Khan's incarceration has fuelled a narrative of persecution and martyrdom among supporters. Long spells of isolation, restrictions on visits, and recurring allegations of mistreatment have strengthened this perception, with some analysts warning that these measures risk backfiring.Imtiaz Gul, executive director of the Center for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), told Al Jazeera: ""The primary objective of blocking access and keeping Khan in solitary confinement is apparently meant to break him into (agreeing to) a compromise and neutralise the groundswell of anti-government sentiment.”Increasingly, barring visits to Khan is viewed not merely as a security decision, but as a political strategy that may harm the governing PML-N and reinforce Khan’s narrative of institutional overreach.Even without its leader on the ballot, PTI remains one of Pakistan's strongest political forces.PTI claims widespread rigging, accusing the government and military of manipulating the results, allegations echoed by several independent observers. The establishment denies all wrongdoing, but the perception of electoral injustice has only strengthened PTI’s street momentum.For perspective, Imran Khan’s PTI had won 151 seats in the 2018 elections, defeating Nawaz Sharif’s PML-N (81 seats) and PPP (54). That victory was hailed by PTI as ""the end of an era,"" breaking the decades-long political monopoly of the PML-N, PPP and the military establishment.Despite his imprisonment, Khan remains Pakistan’s most popular political figure.This enduring popularity, even at a time of complete political inability, poses a direct challenge to Munir's authority.Even brief, controlled public appearances continue to spark major political reactions.During the May 2023 unrest, Imran Khan's court appearance -- after his dramatic arrest by paramilitary forces -- showed him flashing a victory sign. The televised images spread instantly and triggered:These scenes were unprecedented not only for their scale but because the anger erupted in Punjab, the heart of Pakistan's military recruitment and administrative base.More recently, when false rumours about Khan’s death spread, PTI supporters mobilised across Islamabad, Rawalpindi, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, again forcing an immediate government response.A leader who provokes unrest without speaking remains difficult to contain.An analysis in The Diplomat warns that the army ""cannot afford to eliminate"" a leader with deep political roots in Punjab.Such an act, the report cautions, could ""unleash one that the state may not survive.""Khan is ethnically Pashtun but politically anchored in Punjab, with support stretching across Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and the diaspora. His arrest in 2023 showed that anger against the military establishment now emerges in Punjab.Eliminating him would not neutralise his influence; it would likely create a ""martyr"" of unprecedented scale.Munir commands the state apparatus. Khan commands sentiment.And in Pakistan, sentiment has repeatedly proved more enduring than power.No prime minister has survived a confrontation with the military, but no army chief has faced a jailed leader with such widespread support and political resilience.Since August 2023, Khan has faced a series of corruption and security-related cases. In January 2025, he received a 14-year sentence in a land-graft case, a verdict his supporters claim was engineered to keep him out of politics.Khan’s public statements from jail fuel the perception of political persecution. He has directly accused Munir of ""moral bankruptcy,"" and called him ""mentally unstable man"" claiming Pakistan's constitution and rule of law have collapsed under him: ""I have been kept in complete solitary confinement, locked inside a cell with no contact with a single human being for four weeks… even the basic necessities guaranteed under the jail manual have been taken away from us. ""His family members have echoed concerns about his treatment. His sister, after visiting him, said he told her they were subjecting him to ""mental torture"" and held Asim Munir responsible.The recent 27th amendment -- widely called a ""constitutional coup"" -- has entrenched military dominance further. Munir's elevation as chief of defence forces gives him command over all three services.Mahmood Khan Achakzai, head of Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-e-Pakistan, warned: ""There is no constitution in Pakistan now. No judiciary. No social contract. They have made one man into a king above all.""Months ago, Munir's increasing visibility included multiple meetings with Donald Trump. Munir even nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, crediting him with easing India–Pakistan high military tensions, a move driven by a desire for US recognition. Trump later referred to him as his ""favourite field marshal.""It is often assumed that political power requires physical presence. Imran's continuing influence disproves that assumption.His followers still speak of him not as a convicted convict, but as a leader wronged. The slogans, the sense of injustice, the personal stories -- all add up to mobilisation potential. And that potential doesn’t require Khan’s freedom; it only requires people’s belief.Statements from his family amplify this -- for instance, the anguish voiced by his son over not knowing whether his father is safe in jail. Such public airing of fear and trauma becomes a magnet for sympathy and solidarity.""Not knowing whether your father is safe, injured or even alive is a form of psychological torture,"" he had said in written remarks.However, Imran Khan's sister was eventually allowed to meet the former prime minister. After the visit, she said, ""Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he told me they are subjecting him to mental torture, and that Asim Munir is responsible for all of this.""For the military leadership under Asim Munir, the calculus is not just about brute strength, it is about legitimacy. Pakistan’s power dynamics have long relied on a veneer of neutrality: the idea that the army guards the system while politics handles politics. Overplaying that role risks shattering the illusion.From Ayub Khan and Yahya Khan to Zia-ul-Haq and Pervez Musharraf , every era of military rule reinforced the pattern: the army positioned itself not merely as a defender of borders, but as the ultimate arbiter of Pakistan's politics and identity.Each takeover was justified through narratives of chaos, corruption, or national security, allowing the establishment to retain dominance even during civilian periods. Today, under Asim Munir, this pattern continues in a more sophisticated form: instead of overt coups, power is exercised through constitutional engineering, judicial pressure, and political sidelining, most visibly in the dismantling of Imran Khan’s political career. The military’s quest is not only to command the state but to remain indispensable to its very definition.As long as Imran Khan remains a contested figure, not just legally, but symbolically, the army's claim to neutrality becomes harder to maintain.International pressure, media scrutiny, and internal dissent all rise with every heavy-handed move.Hence, the challenge for Munir may be deeper than suppressing one man, it is about managing optics, institutional trust and political fallout.",Is Imran Khan still a threat to Asim Munir? The question looms over Pakistan ’s power structure. Khan has transformed from a jailed political leader into a symbolic and political counterweight to Munir’s expanding military-political dominance.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125789753,imgsize-1800195,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-62.jpg"
