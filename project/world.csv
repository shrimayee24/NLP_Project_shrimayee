Tajikistan bans hijab in campaign against public religiosity: All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/tajikistan-bans-hijab-in-campaign-against-public-religiosity-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/111195960.cms,"Ban on hijab in Tajikistan: All you need to know

Tajikistan president Emomali Rahmon gave his assent to the bill to prohibit hijab, AKIpress reported. The lower chamber of parliament approved the bill on June 8, reported Asia Plus. The law mostly targets the hijab, or Islamic head scarf, and other traditional items of Islamic clothing, which started coming to Tajikistan in recent years from the Middle East. Tajikistan sees hijab associated with Islamic extremists. Penalties for offenders vary from the equivalent of 7,920 somonis for individuals and to 39,500 somonis for legal entities. Government officials and religious authorities reportedly face much higher fines of 54,000 somonis and 57,600 somonis, respectively, if found guilty. There was an unofficial ban on hijab in Tajikistan for years. The education ministry banned both Islamic clothing and western-style miniskirts for students in 2007. The government wants to promote Tajik national dress instead and conducted campaigns for the same in recent years. Tajikistan has also unofficially banned bushy beards. There are existing laws in the country to restrict Islamic prayer to specific locations. Two years ago, selling black clothes was banned in the country’s capital city Dushanbe. The official hijab ban has been condemned by the Union of Islamic Scholars and clerics in Afghanistan, and by the Council on American-Islamic Relations. ""Banning the hijab is a violation of religious freedom and such bans on religious attire should have no place in any nation that respects the rights of its people,"" said CAIR director Corey Saylor.

Tajikistan parliament has approved the law banning hijab referred to as 'alien garments' ahead of Eid al-Fitr and Eid Al-Adha imposing penalties for offenders. The move comes as part of the government's continuous efforts to curb public display of religion and to promote Tajiki culture. It also banned Idi, the custom in which children seek gift and money during Eid. The Muslim-majority country is dominated by various sects of Islam -- Sunni Muslim population in majority.","Tajikistan president Emomali Rahmon gave his assent to the bill to prohibit hijab.

The move came shortly after Beijing warned Islamabad and identified security as a critical challenge threatening China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).Former PM Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) party, alongside other opposition lawmakers, rejected the military operation without prior parliamentary consultation. “It is our demand that if there is any operation, whether intelligence-based or full-fledged or in certain districts, villages, or tehsils, it is necessary to take this parliament into confidence,” PTI chairman Gohar Khan said. He called for an in-camera briefing by military officers, referencing previous practices.Leader of the opposition Omar Ayub Khan echoed the call for parliamentary approval for military operations. “Chinese officials, during their visit, expressed concerns over CPEC security,” he said.Militants have increasingly targeted Chinese interests in Pakistan, particularly in the northwest and southwest regions, including CPEC. In March, two attacks highlighted the ongoing threats: an attempted breach of Gwadar Port Authority complex by Baloch Liberation Army and a suicide bombing in Shangla district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa targeting a convoy of Chinese engineers, resulting in multiple fatalities.High-ranking Chinese official Liu Jianchao underscored the security threats to CPEC as primary hazards to the project’s cooperation and success. “As people often say, confidence is more precious than gold. In the case of Pakistan, the primary factor shaking the confidence of Chinese investors is the security situation,” Jianchao said at the third meeting of the Pakistan-China joint consultative mechanism.PM Sharif ’s office announced Saturday the operation, asserting the deployment of Pakistan’s comprehensive military, diplomatic, legislative, and socio-economic resources to counter terrorism and extremism decisively.",Opposition parties in Pakistan criticised PM Shehbaz Sharif’s decision to initiate a nationwide military operation named Azm-i-Istehkam.

The attack comes as the US has sent the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower back home after an eight-month deployment in which it lead the American response to the Houthi assaults. Those attacks have reduced shipping drastically through the route crucial to Asian, Middle East and European markets in a campaign the Houthis say will continue as long as the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip rages on.The drone attack happened around dawn off the coast of the rebel-held port city of Hodeida, the British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center said. It said the vessel sustained damage but its mariners on board ""were reported safe."" It did not elaborate on the extent of the damage to the Liberian-flagged, Greek-owner bulk carrier, but said an investigation was ongoing.Hours after the attack, Houthi military spokesman Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree claimed the attack, saying the rebels targeted the Transworld Navigator. Saree claimed without offering evidence the rebels instead used a drone boat in the attack, something contradicted by every other report on the assault.The US military's Central Command also identified the vessel by the same name, saying several mariners on board suffered minor injuries from the attack.The Transworld Navigator ""most recently docked in Malaysia and was en route to Egypt,"" Central Command said. ""This marks the fourth attack by Iranian-backed Houthis on the"" vessel.The Houthis have launched more than 60 attacks targeting specific vessels and fired off other missiles and drones in their campaign that has killed a total of four sailors. They have seized one vessel and sunk two since November. A US-led airstrike campaign has targeted the Houthis since January, with a series of strikes May 30 killing at least 16 people and wounding 42 others, the rebels say.The Houthis have maintained that their attacks target ships linked to Israel, the United States or Britain. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the Israel-Hamas war - including those bound for the Houthis' main benefactor, Iran.The Eisenhower, based in Norfolk, Virginia, is returning home after an over eight-month deployment in combat that the Navy says is its most intense since World War II. The San Diego-based USS Theodore Roosevelt will take the Eisenhower's place after a scheduled exercise in the Indo-Pacific, said Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen.

While his spokesperson claimed that 25,000 people attended the event, numerous journalists independently disputed this figure.Trump, who became the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential candidate in March, has been holding high-profile rallies across the nation to strengthen support ahead of a likely rematch against President Joe Biden in November. Pennsylvania , a crucial swing state, was won by Biden in 2020 after it backed Trump over Hillary Clinton in 2016.Chris Jackson, a Democratic Party activist, posted a 27-second clip on X (formerly Twitter) of Trump at the Philadelphia rally on Saturday, showing empty upper tiers of seating at the venue. Jackson wrote: ""Look at all those empty seats in Philadelphia. Old man can't even fill a high school gym anymore. Sad.""Peter Henlein, a self-styled ""political junkie,"" posted the same clip, writing: ""Here is a video of Trump at his rally tonight in swing state PA at Temple University's Liacouras Center, capacity 10,200.

The capacity at the Philly Trump rally is 10,206, and they're not getting anywhere near that.""In his speech, Trump focused mostly on crime, stating: ""Few communities have suffered more under the Biden regime than Philadelphia. Under Crooked Joe, the City of Brotherly Love is being ravaged by bloodshed and crime.""""Retail theft in Philly—I spend so much time here—is up 135 percent since I left office.

According to the National Weather Service (NWS), the extreme heat will then move to Nebraska and Kansas on Monday.Officials are cautioning residents in the Philadelphia region about hazardous conditions, with high humidity potentially driving heat indices above 105 F (41 C), making it feel even hotter than the actual temperature.""It likely means we'll be seeing periodic periods of excessive heat across a decent part of the country into July,"" said NWS meteorologist Marc Chenard. ""Not continuous at any one spot, but the overall pattern will continue to favor these above normal temperatures.""While some areas like the Ohio Valley, Great Lakes, and New England have seen a decrease in temperatures, the East Coast from Virginia to New York continues to experience heat in the 90s F. The extreme heat conditions are part of a broader pattern linked to climate change, which is causing dangerous heat waves across the Northern Hemisphere and predicted to cause adverse weather effects for years.These heat waves have had catastrophic impacts globally, with hundreds of deaths in Asia and Europe. In Saudi Arabia, over 1,000 people died during the annual pilgrimage to Mecca amid searing temperatures, according to a Reuters tally.In New Mexico, multiple weather events including a dust storm, flooding, and two wildfires have prompted emergency responses. The Biden administration last week declared an emergency over the wildfires, which resulted in two deaths and destroyed more than 1,400 structures.The FBI has offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of those responsible for the fires, which have burned 25,000 acres (10,117 hectares) near the village of Ruidoso, as reported by the government wildfire tracking website Inciweb.Alongside the heat, other states are grappling with flooding. Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds issued a disaster proclamation for 21 counties affected by flooding from heavy rains in the northwest part of the state. In Rock Valley, officials ordered some residents to evacuate with assistance from the National Guard, according to local news reports.Southern Minnesota and southeastern South Dakota are also under flood advisories.","Baltimore and Philadelphia are expected to reach near-record highs of around 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) on Sunday.

More 'presidential'?

WASHINGTON: Joe Biden and Donald Trump square off for a historic US presidential debate this week, with the stage set for what could be a pivotal moment in the 2024 race as millions of potential voters tune in.The showdown fires the starting gun on what promises to be a bruising summer on the campaign trail, in a deeply polarized and tense United States still convulsed over the chaos and violence that accompanied the 2020 .With only two debates this cycle, Thursday's high-stakes clash takes on heightened significance, and both candidates have stepped up their personal attacks, with national polls showing the pair neck and neck.""The debate is important because it's an opportunity for two well-known candidates to 'reintroduce' themselves to a public that knows them well but hasn't been paying attention,"" said Donald Nieman, a political analyst and history professor at Binghamton University in New York state.""The big question is how much of the public, beyond political aficionados, will pay attention to such an early debate.""For Trump, the 90-minute clash is a chance to drive home worries about 81-year-old Biden's mental alertness, although the Republican, 78, has faced age concerns of his own.For Biden, the first ever debate between a sitting and former president will be an opportunity to underline the legal challenges engulfing Trump and to paint him as unfit for office.The president will also be desperate to avoid any major gaffes which, at this stage, could lose him the November election.The debate comes in the wake of a criminal trial that has consumed Trump's attention for months, with his sentencing on 34 convictions for falsifying business records scheduled for July 11.Both candidates shunned the bipartisan commission that has run debates since 1988, deciding instead to go with CNN for a first showdown unusually early in the year, and another on ABC on September 10.Abortion, the state of US democracy and foreign conflicts are all issues of concern to voters, although inflation and border security are likely to loom largest.The last debates between the two men in 2020 were fraught, with Biden at one point snapping ""will you shut up, man?"" as Trump repeatedly interrupted him.This time, moderators have more tools than usual to maintain decorum, with the microphones muted except for the candidate whose turn it is to speak.""Trump is notoriously undisciplined and is likely to chafe at not being able to dominate the event by talking over his opponent and drawing out time with his long-winded, insult-laden tirades,"" said political scientist Nicholas Creel, of Georgia College and State University.""Biden is also counting on this debate reminding Americans of the chaos that was the Trump presidency, so Trump being unable to abide by the rules and performing poorly as a result is a very striking possibility.""But debates are about sound bites on social media as much as policy arguments, and both candidates will look for explosive viral moments.""I'll be looking at whether former president Trump tries to become more 'presidential' in any respect, though the campaign trail would suggest the answer to that is no,"" said Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University.The Biden campaign released an ad last week hitting Trump over his criminal convictions as the president headed to his mountainside retreat at Camp David to fine-tune attack lines and rebuttals.Trump, who struggles in granular discussions of policy, huddled with aides and vice presidential hopefuls at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, where the emphasis was more on tone and broad substance than detail.Trump would benefit by sticking to a script, highlighting Biden's weaknesses on inflation and immigration and dialing down the bombast, said Nieman, the Binghamton analyst.""It would disappoint his base, but it would go far to make inroads with suburban, college-educated women,"" he told AFP.","Joe Biden and Donald Trump square off for a historic US presidential debate this week.

""Gaza is Ours!"" and ""Death to Israel!"" The incident occurred shortly after the graduation, which had been themed ""All you need is love.""During the attack , the Jewish woman's husband was thrown to the ground, put in a chokehold, and repeatedly kicked and punched by members of the other family. One woman struck him with the sharp heel of her stiletto shoe. The couple's 10-year-old twins witnessed the assault. The mother, Lana, believes her family was targeted because they are Jewish.The incident is considered one of the worst outbursts of antisemitism in NYC public schools since the Hamas terror attack in Israel and the war in Gaza on October 7. Tova Plaut, a city educator and advocate for Jewish peers, had previously warned that tolerating overtly antisemitic views would lead to a toxic environment and physical violence against Jewish students and families.Initially, the NYPD did not classify the incident as a hate crime, but after the couple urged them to reconsider, the Hate Crimes Task Force began investigating the incident.During the graduation ceremony, one student had walked across the stage wearing a graduate cap marked ""Free Palestine"" and waving a small Palestinian flag, which upset Lana's mother and caused her to walk out. A school administrator informed another parent that the city Department of Education's legal staff had approved the display as an expression of free speech.The attack began when relatives of the boy with the flag tried to push Lana and Johan out of the way as they were taking pictures with their children in front of a PS 682 banner and balloons. An older man shouted anti-Israel slogans, and when Johan argued with him, another man punched Johan and a scuffle ensued. Johan was put in a chokehold and held down by multiple people, while their 16-year-old son was punched in the face when he tried to help his father.Lana was also assaulted by a woman from the group who pulled her hair and knocked her to the ground, shouting, ""I will kill you."" No security was on site, but two male teachers intervened to break up the attack. Johan was taken to Maimonides Medical Center with injuries, while Lana suffered a gash on her leg and their teen son had a bloody nose.The police made one arrest: Ez-Al Dean Bazar, 26, who punched and dragged Johan. However, the criminal complaint filed by the Brooklyn District Attorney's office did not mention any motive for the attack.","A Jewish mother and her husband, who is Dominican and Catholic, were violently attacked by an Arabic-speaking family at their children's fifth-grade graduation ceremony.

A recently released video from 1999 shows a man identified by the FBI as a Saudi intelligence agent filming various locations in Washington , DC, three months before Al-Qaida decided to carry out the 9/11 attacks .The footage, which was in the possession of the FBI, was unsealed as part of a court action by families of the 9/11 victims who claim that Saudi Arabia's government was complicit in the event, a claim the country's rulers deny. The video was obtained by CBS and aired on the 60 Minutes program.In the video the man, Omar al-Bayoumi , provides commentary about various locations in the city, including the Washington Monument and the entry points and security arrangements of the US Capitol building. He also refers to a ""plan"" at one point. The Capitol is believed to have been the target of one of the planes before its hijackers were overwhelmed by passengers, causing it to crash in the Pennsylvania countryside.The film was initially discovered by UK investigators in Bayoumi's flat in Birmingham, where he was a PhD student at Aston University, in the days following the 9/11 attacks. The flat also contained an address book that lawyers for the families say contains the contact details of officials in the Saudi government at the time. Scotland Yard provided the footage to the FBI.Bayoumi has long been a subject of speculation due to his links to two of the 9/11 hijackers, Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Mihdhar. Declassified FBI reports suggest that Bayoumi may have had advanced knowledge of the 9/11 attacks and provided significant assistance to the hijackers after their arrival in the US.In the video, Bayoumi greets the ""esteemed brothers"" and welcomes them from ""Washington the American capital city."" He points out the Washington Monument and mentions going there to report back in detail. The FBI claims that when Bayoumi was shooting the video, he was accompanied by two Saudi Arabian diplomats who the bureau said had ties to al-Qaida.The official 9/11 Commission report, published in 2004, concluded that intelligence failures on the part of the CIA and FBI were primarily to blame for the attack. The report stated that there was no credible evidence that Bayoumi believed in violent extremism or knowingly aided extremist groups. When Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, credited as the attack mastermind, was asked under interrogation if he knew Bayoumi, he said he did not.",Omar al-Bayoumi filmed locations in Washington three months before the 9/11 attacks.

Hadley Duvall, a 22-year-old woman from Owensboro, Kentucky , will join first lady Jill Biden in Pennsylvania this weekend to campaign for abortion rights as part of the 2024 election push.Duvall became an advocate for abortion rights after being raped by her stepfather at the age of 12, which resulted in a pregnancy and miscarriage. Her stepfather was convicted of rape and is currently serving time in prison.Last fall, Duvall shared her story in a campaign ad for the Kentucky governor's race, highlighting the consequences of abortion restrictions, especially those without exceptions for rape or incest.In the ad supporting Democratic governor Andy Beshear, Duvall called out the anti-abortion Republican candidate, stating, ""anyone who believes there should be no exceptions for rape and incest could never understand what it's like to stand in my shoes."" Beshear's reelection victory was attributed, in part, to Duvall's ad, which resonated with rural, male voters who had previously supported Republican Donald Trump for president.Duvall will appear with Jill Biden at a rally in Pittsburgh on Sunday as part of President Joe Biden's effort to motivate voters on abortion rights. The first lady will also hold an event in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, on the same day.The Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe vs Wade on June 24, 2022, has led to abortion bans in roughly half the states, with 10 states having no exceptions for rape or incest. These bans have far-reaching consequences beyond restricting access to those seeking to end unwanted pregnancies.The Pennsylvania events are part of a larger campaign push by the Biden administration around the anniversary of the Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization decision. The campaign includes more than 35 events across the country, featuring women and doctors who have been deeply affected by the fall of Roe.","Hadley Duvall, a 22-year-old woman from Owensboro, Kentucky, will join first lady Jill Biden in Pennsylvania this weekend to campaign for abortion rights.

The provision against the inclusion of non-Muslims in the constitution of SIC is unconstitutional.

There is nothing wrong with the ECP and the PHC's decision of not giving reserved seats to SIC.

Instead, the party gained strength after independently elected candidates backed by PTI joined it post-elections.The SIC's plea was rejected by both the ECP and the PHC, prompting the party to challenge the decision in the Supreme Court.A full bench of the Supreme Court, led by chief justice Qazi Faez, is set to hear the case of reserved seats on Monday.Previously, on May 6, the Supreme Court provided relief to the PTI by suspending the PHC's decision to reject the SIC plea. Following this ruling, the ECP on May 14 suspended the victory notifications of 77 candidates declared successful on the reserved seats.The final ruling by the Supreme Court will determine the fate of these 77 reserved seats, which could influence law-making in the country despite not altering the current power structure.",The Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) backed by imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) is ineligible for reserved seats as it does not permit non-Muslims to become members.
