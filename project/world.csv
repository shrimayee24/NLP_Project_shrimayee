The opposition also demanded a statement from PM Narendra Modi.The INDIA bloc comprising Congress, Samajwadi Party, DMK, NCP, Shiv Sena, Left parties among others, barring TMC, also held protests at the main entrance of the Parliament building, raising slogans against handcuffing of Indians and comparing it with ""slavery"" and carrying placards like ""Humans.

""Could we not have sent our aircraft? Are humans treated in such a manner?""Kharge said, ""We, the INDIA parties, shall not tolerate the humiliation of Indian nationals.

Illegals retreat to Canada and Mexico to evade US detection,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/illegals-retreat-to-canada-and-mexico-to-evade-us-detection/articleshow/117999404.cms,"AHMEDABAD: Despite the crackdown by US administration against illegal immigration, the desperation to make a life there remains strong, leading to the emergence of a new, risky phenomenon - temporary reverse migration .Individuals, who had once entered US via Canada or Mexico, are returning to these countries in a bid to evade detection and deportation. They plan to wait for ""conditions to get favourable"" and re-enter US, again illegally, say sources.Typically, human smugglers facilitated routes via Dubai or Sharjah before arranging flights to Mexico City or Cancun, from where migrants would cross into US. But networks are now quickly adapting to shifting dynamics. A source privy to developments revealed that smugglers have warned illegal travellers to ""stop where he or she is and call off any future journey"" due to stricter border enforcement .""However, there were some who have already crossed into US towns near the north or the south border. These people have been instructed to either return to Mexico or Canada, where they can lie low until the situation in US normalises. Then they will be sent in through illegal routes,"" said a source inside a human smuggling ring, adding that all illegal immigrants usually hold valid tourist or student visas for these two countries.A man from Palaj, in Kalol, who entered US illegally last month, returned to Mexico within 15 days along with eight others. ""We had no choice because deportation was imminent had we been caught. The US has been quick in sending back all immigrants caught at the border,"" he said.","Smugglers have warned illegal travellers to ""stop where he or she is and call off any future journey"" Some people have already crossed into US towns near the north or the south border.

'Bulldozer procession' targets homes of Awami leaders,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bulldozer-procession-targets-homes-of-awami-leaders/articleshow/117998278.cms,"DHAKA: Thousands of protesters set fire to the home of Bangladesh's founding leader as his daughter, ousted former PM Sheikh Hasina , called on her supporters to stand against the interim govt. The South Asian nation of 170 million people has struggled with political strife since Hasina was forced to flee to India in Aug following weeks of protests against her rule in which more than 1,000 people were killed.Witnesses said several thousand protesters, some armed with sticks, hammers and other tools, gathered around the historic house and independence monument while others brought a crane and excavator to demolish the building late on Wednesday.The demolition continued into Thursday, with much of the front of the house destroyed. Many people were seen breaking into it and taking steel and wooden items and books from inside. Similar cases of vandalism also took place at several other places, targeting Awami League leaders. At least two people, accused of being members of Awami League, were beaten by the crowd, witnesses said, reported AFP.The protest rally was organised alongside a broader call, dubbed ""Bulldozer Procession"", to disrupt Hasina's scheduled online address on Wednesday. Protesters, many aligned with the ""Students Against Discrimination"" group, voiced fury over her speech they saw as a challenge to the newly formed interim govt.A symbol of the country's establishment, the house is where Mujibur Rahman declared Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan in 1971.

The residence of Hasina's late husband Wajed Mian known as 'Sudha Sadan' on Road 5 in Dhanmondi was also set on fire by protesters.The actions in Dhaka fuelled similar destructions in other parts of Bangladesh. Protesters demolished the home of her cousins - Sheikh Helal Uddin and Sheikh Salauddin Jewel - in Khulna City. Thousands of people gathered around the house, chanting ""Delhi or Dhaka - Dhaka, Dhaka"" and ""Down with Mujibism"". Prothom Alo, the largest Bengali daily, reported crowds used govt-owned excavators to smash down the building.

Mother of Alabama death row inmate still hoping for miracle just hours before execution window opens

An inmate in Alabama found guilty of killing a woman in her home whilst she slept was executed on Thursday evening, marking the fourth time nitrogen gas was used for capital punishment in the United States.Demetrius Frazier, aged 52, was declared dead at 6:36pm CST in a south Alabama correctional facility for the 1991 murder and rape of Pauline Brown, 41.This was Alabama's first execution this year and the third in the US in 2025, following executions in Texas and South Carolina.""First of all I want to apologise to the family and friends of Pauline Brown. What happened to Pauline Brown should have never happened,"" Frazier had said earlier. He also expressed criticism towards Michigan governor Gretchen Witmer regarding her inaction on appeals for his return to serve his previous life sentence in Michigan.""I love everybody on death row. Detroit Strong,"" he said.His mother and anti-death penalty activists had requested governor Whitmer to allow Frazier to return to Michigan to complete his life sentence for a teenage girl's murder before his transfer to Alabama. Michigan does not implement capital punishment.The Michigan attorney general's office stated in January that the state did not want Frazier back. While in Michigan custody in 1992, Frazier admitted to Brown's murder, according to police reports.Prior to the execution, governor Whitmer told The Detroit News that her predecessor, Rick Snyder, ""unfortunately"" agreed to transfer Frazier to Alabama, where local authorities took control.""It's a really tough situation,"" she told the media outlet before the execution. ""I understand the pleas and concerns. Michigan is not a death penalty state.""On November 27, 1991, prosecutors stated that Frazier, then 19, broke into Brown's Birmingham flat while she slept. They said he demanded money and sexually assaulted Brown at gunpoint after receiving $80. He then fatally shot her and later returned to eat and search for more money.Frazier received a life sentence in Michigan for killing Crystal Kendrick, 14, in 1992.In 1996, an Alabama jury found him guilty of Brown's murder with a 10-2 vote for the death penalty. He remained in Michigan until 2011, when both states' governors agreed to his transfer to Alabama's death row.Alabama became the first state to carry out nitrogen gas executions, implementing three in the previous year. The procedure involves administering pure nitrogen through a respiratory mask, causing death by oxygen deprivation.The execution commenced at 6:10pm after a final mask check. Frazier moved his hands circularly initially, then showed signs of distress. At 6:13pm, he lifted his legs off the gurney.He appeared to gasp before his breathing slowed to intermittent breaths. Movement ceased by 6:21pm The chamber curtains closed at 6:29pm.Commissioner John Hamm reported nitrogen flow lasted approximately 18 minutes, with monitors indicating no heartbeat 13 minutes after administration began.A federal judge recently declined to stop Frazier's execution despite his lawyers arguing about the method's speed. Media witnesses, including The Associated Press, documented convulsions in previous nitrogen executions.The judge concluded that execution accounts did not indicate ""severe psychological pain or distress"" beyond what is inherent in executions.","Demetrius Frazier, aged 52, was declared dead at 6:36pm CST in a south Alabama correctional facility for the 1991 murder and rape of Pauline Brown, 41.

But the defense department said the first group of 10 deportees, who were brought to the base Tuesday, were too dangerous for the migrant site.Instead they were put in a vacant section of the military prison that houses terrorism suspects and convicts, far from the area where other deportees will be held by department of Homeland Security.On Wednesday, Karoline Leavitt, White House press secretary, said the men were members of a Venezuelan gang called Tren de Aragua, which the US govt last year labeled a ""transnational criminal organisation"" for human trafficking and other criminal acts. The gang traces its beginnings to a prison in Venezuela.The US govt has long held migrants at Guantanamo Bay, primarily Cubans and Haitians who have been picked up at sea. But the wartime prisoners have always been kept away from the migrants. Migrants are in the custody of the DHS. Suspected al-Qaida members are in the custody of defense dept.The decision to fly migrants from within the US to the base comes as Trump ramps up deportations and immigration enforcement across the country. Last week, he ordered his administration to expand a small, 120-bed center on the base to hold up to 30,000 deportees.On Tuesday evening, US Customs and Border Protection posted a video on social media showing the men being loaded onto the Air Force C-17 plane in El Paso, Texas.""Flights to Guantanamo Bay have begun,"" the post said. ""The worst of the worst have no place in our homeland.""Immigration officials hold around 40,000 detainees in private prisons and local county lockups across US. But Trump suggested last week that the use of Guantanamo could double detention capacity.It is unclear how long migrants will be held at the facility and where they will be taken next, but officials said Wednesday they would be sent to their home country or to another ""appropriate destination.""

US President Donald Trump on Thursday reiterated his proposal for the United States to take control of the Gaza Strip, as Israel’s army has been ordered to prepare plans to allow large numbers of Palestinians to leave the territory.In a post on Truth Social post on Thursday, Trump wrote, “The Gaza Strip would be turned over to the United States by Israel at the conclusion of fighting. The Palestinians, people like Chuck Schumer, would have already been resettled in far safer and more beautiful communities, with new and modern homes, in the region. They would actually have a chance to be happy, safe, and free.

No soldiers by the US would be needed! Stability for the region would reign!!!”Trump’s remarks follow his initial proposal earlier in the week. His plan suggests that Gaza, with US-led international development, could be transformed into one of the “greatest and most spectacular developments” on Earth.Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has backed Trump’s proposal, telling Fox News that the idea of allowing Palestinians to leave Gaza is a “remarkable idea” that should be “pursued and done.” Israel’s military has also been instructed to prepare plans for large-scale departures of Palestinians from the territory.""I have instructed the IDF (military) to prepare a plan to enable voluntary departure for Gaza residents,"" Israeli defence minister Katz said, adding that they could go ""to any country willing to accept them"". ""The plan will include exit options through land crossings, as well as special arrangements for departure by sea and air,"" he added, branding Trump's plan as ""bold"".“This is the first good idea that I’ve heard,” Netanyahu said. “It will create a different future for everyone.”Trump’s announcement at a joint White House press conference with Netanyahu on Tuesday has drawn sharp criticism from rights groups, which argue that the plan violates international law and amounts to ethnic cleansing.Despite the backlash, Trump has remained firm, describing Gaza’s potential transformation as the “Riviera of the Middle East.”","US President Donald Trump reiterates his proposal for the United States to take control of the Gaza Strip.

Demonstrators burned Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's residence, damaged murals

Bangladesh has formally lodged a ""strong protest"" with India regarding statements made by deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina , particularly those concerning the alleged recent vandalism of her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman 's house.Bangladesh slammed Hasina's latest speech as being ""false and fabricated"", adding that it views the former PM's statements and activities while in exile in India as a ""hostile act"".It has requested that India prevent her from making further speeches, citing the importance of mutual respect and the historical relationship between the two countries.""The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh lodged a strong protest with the Government of India over the false and fabricated comments and statements continuously being made in different platforms including social media, by the former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, instigating instability in Bangladesh. Through the protest note, handed over to the Acting High Commissioner of India in Dhaka, the Ministry conveyed the deep concern, disappointment and serious reservation of the Government of Bangladesh, as such statements are hurting the sentiments of the people in Bangladesh....The Ministry also emphasized that such activities by her, are considered as a hostile act towards Bangladesh and are not conducive to the efforts at establishing a healthy relationship between the two countries,"" the bangladesh foreign ministry said in a post on Facebook.On Thursday, the Bangladesh's foreign ministry summoned the acting high commissioner of India to Dhaka. Bangladesh foreign adviser Md Touhid Hossain said Bangladesh had formally requested India in writing to prevent Sheikh Hasina from making such statements and remarks, as those are against the interests of Bangladesh.He also said, ""We have not got any response in this regard. Due to recent developments, Bangladesh has once again sent a protest note to India. Indian acting high commissioner was summoned and handed over the protest letter so that she (Sheikh Hasina) is prevented.""Hasina delivered the speech on Wednesday night after protesters vandalised and set on fire her father and Bangladesh founder Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's residence in Dhaka. Similar cases of vandalism also took place at several other places, targeting Awami League leaders.During her address, Hasina urged citizens to mount opposition against the present administration.Speaking with evident emotion, Hasina noted that whilst Pakistani forces had plundered the house during the 1971 Liberation War, they neither demolished nor burnt it.""Today, this house is being demolished. What crime had it committed? Why were they so afraid of the house... I seek justice from the people of the country. Didn't I do anything for you?"" she said.""They can demolish a building, but not the history... but they must also remember that history takes its revenge,"" Hasina said.""They are yet to have the strength to destroy the national flag, the constitution and the independence that we earned at the cost of lives of millions of martyrs with a bulldozer,"" she said, seemingly referring to the Muhammad Yunus-led interim government.Demonstrators gathered near Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's 32 Dhanmondi residence in Dhaka, responding to social media calls for a ""bulldozer procession"". The crowd subsequently ignited the building.The neighbouring structure, which served as offices for various Awami League organisations, was also destroyed. Protesters damaged murals featuring Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.Demonstrators also set ablaze 'Sudha Sadan' on Road 5 in Dhanmondi, the residence of Hasina's deceased husband Wajed Mian.The homes of her cousins - Sheikh Helal Uddin and Sheikh Salauddin Jewel - in Khulna City were also destroyed by protesters.Students removed Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's name from Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Hall of Dhaka University in protest.At 77, Hasina has been residing in India since August 5 of the previous year, having escaped Bangladesh amidst a significant student-led uprising that ended her Awami League's 16-year governance.","Bangladesh has formally lodged a ""strong protest"" with India regarding statements made by deposed PM Sheikh Hasina.

A US Marine and three defence contractors have been identified as the four personnel killed in a military plane crash in the southern Philippines on Thursday.The US-contracted Beechcraft Super King Air B300 went down in Maguindanao del Sur province while conducting a surveillance mission at the request of Philippine authorities, according to the US Indo-Pacific Command .

Musk’s 25-year-old DOGE staffer resigns after racist posts emerge: report

'Normalize Indian hate'



‘What Musk is doing is illegal’: Bernie Sanders slams DOGE gutting agencies

A staff member of the Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ), led by Elon Musk , resigned Thursday after the White House was questioned about his connection to a social media account that promoted racism and eugenics , The Wall Street Journal reported.Marko Elez , a 25-year-old programmer, was one of two DOGE staffers with access to the US Treasury’s payment system. The Wall Street Journal reported that Elez had a profile on Musk’s social media platform, X, where he made posts supporting a ""eugenic immigration policy"" and calling for the repeal of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.In a September post, Elez reportedly wrote, “You could not pay me to marry outside of my ethnicity.”Another post the same month encouraged users to “normalize Indian hate,” referring to the large number of Indian workers in Silicon Valley’s technology sector.“Just for the record, I was racist before it was cool,” the account posted in July, according to the Journal.Elez studied computer science at Rutgers University. During his sophomore year, he co-founded Unimetrics.io, a company designed to connect high school students with mentors to improve their college applications, as per the WSJ report.He later worked for Musk at SpaceX, contributing to Starlink satellite projects, and at X, where he focused on artificial intelligence, according to archived versions of his personal website.After The Wall Street Journal contacted the White House about Elez’s posts, press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that he had resigned, as per a report in The Independent.The Journal found that archived posts from Elez’s X account (@nullllptr) repeatedly targeted Indian technology workers. In December 2024, he wrote that Indian workers in the US on H1B visas are “going back don’t worry guys.”Another post from Elez expressed hostility toward both sides in the Israel-Gaza war . He wrote, “I would not mind at all if Gaza and Israel were both wiped off the face of the Earth.”DOGE has gained significant power in President Donald Trump’s second term, largely due to the influence of Musk, who donated hundreds of millions of dollars to support Trump’s re-election.In an interview with Bloomberg published Thursday, US treasury secretary Scott Bessent said he had personally reviewed the background of one of the two Treasury employees from Musk’s DOGE team.“These are highly trained professionals,” Bessent told Bloomberg. “This is not some roving band running around doing things.”He added, “This is methodical, and it is going to yield big savings.”","Marko Elez, a 25-year-old programmer, was one of two DOGE staffers with access to the US Treasury’s payment system.

"US releases video of shackled Indians, says committed to swift removals",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/farthest-us-deportation-flight-in-military-plane-us-officials/articleshow/117997427.cms,"NEW DELHI: US authorities doubled down on the deportation of 104 Indian nationals with the border patrol chief releasing a video on X that showed Indian nationals, handcuffed and shackled, being hustled into a C17 military aircraft.Asked why a military aircraft was used to deport Indians, a US embassy spokesperson, without going into the details of the flight, said it’s the policy of the US to faithfully execute the immigration laws against all inadmissible and removable aliens. In the first 2 weeks of US President Donald Trump’s return, while dozens of nonmilitary flights were used to deport illegal migrants, only 6 such military flights – to Honduras, Ecuador, Peru and Guatemala - were used for the same purpose.“USBP ( US Border Patrol ) and partners successfully returned illegal aliens to India, marking the farthest deportation flight yet using military transport. This mission underscored our commitment to enforcing immigration laws and ensuring swift removals. If you cross illegally, you will be removed,’’ said USBP chief Michael Banks in a post on X, while putting out a video of men being loaded into a C-17 defence aircraft. The embassy spokesperson here also said enforcing the US immigration laws is critically important to the national security and public safety of the country.While foreign minister S Jaishankar said in response to clarifications sought in Parliament that India was aware about the flight that landed in Amritsar and had provided it the necessary clearances, a few central and South American countries have complained that they were notified about deportation flights only after take-off. Brazil also lodged a protest with the US for the “flagrant” violation of the rights of its citizens.India has accepted illegal immigrants from the US every year since 2009 after verifying their Indian origin. The Modi government accepted more than 6,000 Indian nationals from the US during the first Trump administration . However, the in-your-face spectacle that accompanied what was the first deportation flight to India under Trump 2.0 will be of concern to India, not least because it occurred days before PM Narendra Modi lands in Washington for a bilateral summit with Trump.The last time a major removal flight was conducted to India, in a large frame charter plane, was on October 22 last year. This was made public though only 3 days later – on October 25 – in the form of a press release issued by the Department of Homeland Security. On this occasion, the information about the flight was leaked to the media shortly after the flight carrying Indian nationals took off from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) centre in San Antonio on February 3. The post by Banks, complete with a video, also came in the middle of a raging debate here about whether or not the returnees were handcuffed.Like Colombia, India can send its own aircraft to bring back illegal migrants but the government gave no indication Thursday that it will exercise that option. Even though countries like Mexico remain reluctant to accept military repatriation planes, Trump is likely to use more such flights to not just supplement nonmilitary deportation but also send out a message that his promised crackdown on illegal immigration is not an empty threat.","US authorities doubled down on the deportation of 104 Indian nationals.

‘TIP OF THE ICEBERG’: Trump team unravels government waste at USAID

The Trump administration announced a plan on Thursday to significantly reduce staffing for US aid programs as part of efforts to shut down the US Agency for International Development ( USAID ). The plan would leave fewer than 300 employees out of the thousands currently working for the agency.Senior officials were informed of the plan on Thursday, two current USAID employees and a former senior official, were quoted as saying by the news agency Associated Press.The plan would reduce the number of staff to fewer than 300 from the current 8,000 direct employees and contractors, the AP report said. In addition, an unspecified number of 5,000 local staff members abroad would continue to run a few aid programs that the administration says will continue for now.It is unclear whether this reduction will be temporary or permanent. The Trump administration has said it is reviewing which aid and development programs might resume in the future.US secretary of state Marco Rubio, speaking in the Dominican Republic, said the US would still provide foreign aid .“But it is going to be foreign aid that makes sense and is aligned with our national interest,” he told reporters.The Trump administration, along with Elon Musk , who leads the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has focused on cutting USAID as part of broader efforts to reduce government programs.Since President Donald Trump took office on January 20, a funding freeze has stopped most USAID programs worldwide. Nearly all agency employees have been placed on administrative leave or furlough. Trump and Musk have discussed eliminating USAID as an independent agency and shifting its remaining programs under the State Department.Democratic lawmakers and others argue that these actions require congressional approval and cannot be done unilaterally.","The plan would reduce the number of staff to fewer than 300 from the current 8,000 direct employees and contractors.

US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday to impose sanctions on the International Criminal Court (ICC) over its investigation of Israel. The US and Israel are not members of the court and do not recognize its authority.The ICC has issued an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for alleged war crimes related to Israel’s military actions in Gaza following the Hamas attack in October 2023. Many Palestinians, including children, have been killed during Israel’s response.The order says that the ICC is carrying out ""illegitimate and baseless actions targeting America and our close ally Israel"" and accuses the court of misusing its power by issuing ""baseless arrest warrants"" against Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant.""The ICC has no jurisdiction over the United States or Israel,"" the order says, adding that its actions set a ""dangerous precedent.""Trump signed the order while Netanyahu was in Washington. The two met at the White House on Tuesday, and Netanyahu also met with lawmakers on Thursday.The order further says that the US will impose ""tangible and significant consequences"" on those responsible for the ICC’s actions. Possible measures include blocking assets and banning ICC officials, employees, and their families from entering the USHuman rights groups said these sanctions could discourage the court's work and contradict US efforts in other international cases.""Victims of human rights abuses around the world turn to the International Criminal Court when they have nowhere else to go, and President Trump's executive order will make it harder for them to find justice,"" said Charlie Hogle of the American Civil Liberties Union. ""The order also raises serious First Amendment concerns because it puts people in the United States at risk of harsh penalties for helping the court identify and investigate atrocities committed anywhere, by anyone.""Hogle added that the order ""is an attack on both accountability and free speech.""The US has never joined the ICC and has long opposed a global court with unelected judges prosecuting American officials. A 2002 law allows the US military to free any American or ally detained by the ICC. In 2020, Trump imposed sanctions on the ICC’s previous chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, for opening an investigation into war crimes in Afghanistan, including those committed by the USFormer President Joe Biden later lifted those sanctions and the US began limited cooperation with the ICC, especially after it charged Russian President Vladimir Putin with war crimes in Ukraine.Sanctions could make it harder for ICC investigators to travel and use US technology to secure evidence. Last year, the ICC experienced a cyberattack that disrupted access to files for weeks.Some European countries oppose US sanctions. The Netherlands urged ICC member states to ""cooperate to mitigate risks of these possible sanctions, so that the court can continue to carry out its work and fulfil its mandate.""",US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday to impose sanctions on the International Criminal Court.

As the MAGA has trained the guns on the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) which provides humanitarian aid to war-ravaged countries, records claim that Ivanka Trump too received money from USAID. And that too for buying recording equipment for a White House event.According to documents, Ivanka Trump used over $11,000 from the department in 2019 to buy video recording and reproducing equipment for a White House event. The documents show $11,539 was to be used by Ivanka in November 2019 to purchase software, CDs, tapes and records. The purchase was approved by Jenifer Healy, who was serving as USAID deputy chief of staff at the time, and the Administrator's Office.Ivanka Trump who was part of the administration as an advisor in the last Trump administration has not reacted to the claims.After Elon Musk announced that USAID is beyond repair and hence it's best to shut it down, President Donald Trump agreed and said USAID has been run by a ""bunch of lunatics"".The White House released a list of foreign aid programs run by the USAID that included $20 million for a ""new Sesame Street show in Iraq""; $1.5 million and $5.5 million to promote LGBTQ+ advocacy in Jamaica and Uganda; $6 million for tourists in Egypt etc. The White House also confirmed that media houses like Politico received funds from USAID though Politico denied the claim.USAID sent $1.5 million to advance DEI in Serbia workplaces, $70,000 for a ""DEI musical"" in Ireland and $32,000 for a ""transgender comic book in Peru."" Reports claimed that other wasteful expenses of USAID included $47,000 on a transgender opera in Colombia, $5 million to EcoHealthAlliance which is one of key NGO ""funding bat virus research at the Wuhan lab"".""I don't know about you.

40,000 employees accepted the deferred resignation program



February 6 was the last day before which federal workers were supposed to let the administration know whether they want to resign or work from the office. But a federal judge Thursday temporarily blocked the buyout offer hours before the deadline. A federal judge in Massachusetts pushed back the deadline for employees to accept the offer, initially set for 11:59 p.m. Thursday, until at least Monday in response to a lawsuit filed by federal workers unions that argued the administration could not guarantee pay beyond the March 14 expiration date for the existing budget.The program had Elon Musk 's design all over it as Musk did the same thing to then-Twitter when he acquired it. The mail sent to the federal employees said if they accept the program, they will receive their salary and other benefits through September without even working. Otherwise, they would have to come to the office and work from the office.About 40,000 of the approximately 2.3 million employees eligible for the buyout offer have accepted it, according to NBC News and The Washington Post—after a figure of around 20,000 was reported a day earlier. CNN reported that Trump was planning a mass layoff of those employees who did not take the buyout.US District George O'Toole prevented the agency from implementing the program's deadline during a brief hearing held hours before federal workers were required to notify OPM of whether they would accept or reject the offer to step away from their positions.A Justice Department lawyer said OPM would provide notice to federal employees that the deadline is paused pending further legal proceedings.For those who opted to keep their positions, the message from the administration noted that the Trump administration could not give ""full assurance regarding the certainty of your position or agency."" It also noted that ""the majority of federal agencies are likely to be downsized through restructurings, realignments, and reductions in force"" as part of Trump's efforts to reform the federal workforce.","40,000 employees accepted the deferred resignation program.

Terrorists kill 3 cops in Pakistan's volatile Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/terrorists-kill-3-cops-in-pakistans-volatile-khyber-pakhtunkhwa/articleshow/117993406.cms,"ISLAMABAD: At least three cops were killed and six injured Thursday after nearly a dozen militants stormed a police check post at Karak district in Pakistan’s restive northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province, officials said.Although no group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack, suspicion is likely to fall on Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which has frequently targeted police and security personnel in the province.“The terrorists opened fire from all sides at the check post in Karak’s Bahadur Khel area, targeting police personnel using light and heavy weapons in an attempt to capture it. Policemen at the checkpost offered stiff resistance in an encounter which lasted two hours, following which the terrorists fled,” the provincial police said in a statement.Pakistan has experienced an escalation in militancy in KP, adjacent to Afghanistan, following the collapse of a tenuous truce between TTP and the state in Nov 2022.Pakistani authorities have linked the surge in militant violence to cross-border incursions from Afghanistan, alleging that the Kabul administration is facilitating TTP fighters, a claim Afghan authorities refute. Most of these assaults have been directed at security and law-enforcement personnel, although civilians and govt officials have also been impacted.In KP’s Dera Ismail Khan district last week, four soldiers were killed by gunfire and an improvised explosive device (IED) unleashed by terrorists.In Balochistan, another restive province in Pakistan’s south, 18 soldiers were killed in an attack by terrorists earlier this month.Islamabad think-tank Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) has described 2024 as the most lethal year for security forces in a decade, with a minimum of 685 military and police fatalities resulting from 444 terror attacks.Alongside such attacks, militants have stepped up targeted killings and kidnappings of officials in KP and Balochistan.","Nearly a dozen militants stormed a police check post at Karak district in Pakistan’s restive northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province.

UN agencies raise alarm over Pakistan's move to deport thousands of Afghans waiting to go to the US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/un-agencies-raise-alarm-over-pakistans-move-to-deport-thousands-of-afghans-waiting-to-go-to-the-us/articleshow/117956288.cms,"Afghan refugees hold placards to discuss their situation after Trump paused US refugee programs, in Islamabad (Image credits: AP)

ISLAMABAD : The UN refugees and migration agencies on Wednesday expressed their concern over Pakistan 's decision to deport thousands of Afghan refugees awaiting relocation to the United States and elsewhere.The UN refugee agency, UNHCR , and the international organization for migration in a statement said they were seeking clarification from Pakistan, which said last week it would deport the refugees back to Afghanistan unless their cases were processed quickly by the countries that had agreed to take them in.About 20,000 Afghans were approved for resettlement in the US under a program that helps people at risk because of their work with the American government, media, aid agencies and rights groups. They were among tens of thousands of Afghans who fled to neighboring Pakistan after their country fell to the Taliban in 2021.However, they were left in limbo after President Donald Trump paused US refugee programs last month.""A UNHCR-issued non-return advisory has been in place since 2021, calling for a suspension of forced returns of Afghan nationals from any country regardless of their status,"" the joint UNHCR-IOM statement said.Pakistan's prime minister Shehbaz Sharif last week gave the green light to evict Afghans without papers from the cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi before March 31, in preparation for deportation if they were not relocated to their host countries.UNHCR and IOM said they are especially concerned for Afghan nationals who face a risk of harm upon return, such as ethnic and religious minorities, women and girls, journalists, human rights activists, and members of artistic professions like musicians and others.It said since January 1, 2025, an uptick in arrests of Afghan nationals in Islamabad and Rawalpindi has caused significant distress, with reports of Afghan nationals of various documentation statuses being rounded up.The Trump administration also announced the US refugee admissions program would be suspended from January 27 for at least three months. It has shocked Afghans who were hoping to travel to the United States soon.Afghans in Pakistan have been virtually living in hiding since 2023 when a crackdown began on foreigners who are in the country without proper documentation. An estimated 800,000 Afghans have either gone back voluntarily or been deported since despite criticism from UN agencies, rights groups and the Taliban.Besides thousands of Afghans who are living in Pakistan and awaiting travel to host countries, there are around 1.45 million Afghan nationals registered with UNHCR as refugees in Pakistan as well but their stay has been extended until June.In the statement, UNHCR and IOM urged ""Pakistan to implement any relocation measures with due consideration for human rights standards, including due process, and the legal status of proof of registration (POR) and afghan citizen card (ACC) holders, who have resided in Pakistan for an extended period of time"".""Pakistan has a proud tradition of hosting refugees, saving millions of lives. This generosity is greatly appreciated,"" UNHCR representative in Pakistan Philippa Candler said.""IOM is committed to work with the government of Pakistan and UNHCR to develop a mechanism to register, manage and screen Afghan nationals in Pakistan,"" said IOM chief of mission, Mio Sato.She said ""This will open the door to tailored solutions including international protection to those in need and pathways for Afghan nationals, with long-standing socioeconomic and family ties in the country.""","UN refugees and migration agencies express concern over Pakistan's decision to deport thousands of Afghan refugees.
