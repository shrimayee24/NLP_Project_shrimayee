Nimisha Priya case: Death sentence in Yemen not overturned?

But what started as a professional arrangement soon turned sinister.Mahdi allegedly manipulated a wedding photograph taken during a trip to India to falsely claim he was married to Nimisha, seized control of the clinic, and began extorting her monthly earnings.Her family alleges that he subjected her to repeated abuse, including physical torture, drug-induced assaults, and confiscation of her passport to prevent her from escaping Yemen. After approaching police and being jailed briefly instead of receiving protection, Nimisha allegedly attempted to sedate Mahdi to retrieve her passport. When a stronger dose was used, Mahdi died due to overdose — leading to Nimisha’s arrest and eventual conviction for murder.(This is a developing story)","37-year-old nurse from Kerala, Nimisha moved to Yemen for work and later partnered with a local man, Talal Abdo Mahdi, to set up a clinic.

Yes, absolutely No, they are regulated enough

Approached clinic in Aug 2024

Centre seized; had tricked health dept earlier





HYDERABAD: In a twist to the surrogacy case involving a fertility clinic in Secunderabad, police have found that the baby was allegedly bought from a poor family and given to the city couple who sought IVF treatment in 2024.Police said the clinic suggested that the couple opt for surrogacy instead and assured them that the child would be biologically theirs. They were charged Rs 35 lakh for the procedure.Read also: IVF or infant trade? Dr. Patchipala Namratha linked to 2020 child trafficking case On Sunday, Hyderabad police arrested eight people including prime accused Dr Athaluri Namratha (64) of Universal Srushti Fertility Centre, Dr Nargula Sadanandam (41) an anesthetist from the state-run Gandhi Hospital and agents and technicians.They were booked on charges of cheating clients in the name of a surrogacy procedure and running a baby-selling racket. Cops also found that Srushti's licence had been cancelled in 2021. Dr Namratha was running it illegally.She has been operating three more centres in Kondapur (Hyderabad), Vijayawada, and Visakhapatnam. All of them were raided on Sunday.""The latest case appears to be only the tip of the iceberg; there could be many such cases.We are probing other couples who sought surrogacy and IVF treatment at different branches of the fertility centre to ascertain this,"" said S Rashmi Perumal, DCP (north zone).Read also: Hyderabad surrogacy clinic lost registration in 2021, but doctor continued to run it illegally Previously, Dr Namratha came under scrutiny twice – in 2016 and 2020. In the first case her licence was suspended for five years by the Telangana Medical Council after an NRI couple from the US alleged that the newborn given to them, allegedly through surrogacy, was not biologically related to them. Then in 2020 Vizag police arrested Dr Namratha and five others for allegedly trafficking newborns.Police said that more than 10 cases were previously registered against the accused doctor and her clinic at three places – Visakhapatnam, Hyderabad and Guntur.The latest incident came to light on July 26 when a city-based couple approached the Gopalapuram police alleging that the baby handed to them by the clinic – also known as Srushti Test Tube Baby Centre – following commercial surrogacy, was not biologically related to the father. They had independently run a DNA test to establish this. The couple allegedly paid Rs 35 lakh for the procedure.""After interrogating the prime accused we have established that it is not a case of surrogacy. Dr Namratha and her employees were selling infants to childless couples bought from poor pregnant women who were lured with money,"" said the DCP.She added: ""The biological parents of the baby, who have also been arrested, belong to Assam and were living in Hyderabad. They were paid Rs 90,000 and the mother was sent to Visakhapatnam for delivery.""The baby boy was two days old when he was sold to the complainant couple under the impression that it is their biological son.Among the others arrested are Dr Namratha's son P Jayanth Krishna (25), a practising advocate who used to manage his mother's funds, two employees of the clinic C Kalyani Atchayyamma (40) and G Chenna Rao (37), and an agent Dhanasri Santoshi (38). The biological parents of the infant have been identified as Mohammed Ali Adik (38) and Nasreen Begum (25). While seven of the accused have been sent to 14-day judicial remand to Chanchalguda jail, C Kalyani, an employee at Visakhapatnam branch is being brought to Hyderabad.""Apart from the illegal trade, the accused are also guilty of indulging in commercial surrogacy which is illegal in India. Only altruistic surrogacy is allowed,"" the DCP said.Senior police officials said the complainants, originally from Rajasthan, approached the fertility centre in Aug 2024 for fertility and IVF consultation. During the visit, Dr Namratha conducted fertility tests and advised the couple to opt for surrogacy. They were asked to visit the clinic's Visakhapatnam branch for further procedures.""They were assured that a surrogate would be arranged by the clinic and that their embryo would be transplanted. Over a span of nine months, the couple made multiple payments for consultation, treatment, and surrogate care,"" said a police official, adding, ""Throughout this period, the clinic provided regular updates claiming that the pregnancy was progressing smoothly.""In June 2025, the couple was informed that the surrogate mother delivered a baby boy via C-section in Visakhapatnam. They were asked to pay an additional delivery charge – of Rs 2 lakh – before taking custody of the child. The clinic claimed that the child's biological father was demanding more money.""Upon reaching Vizag, the baby was handed over along with documents falsely indicating that the child was biologically theirs, including a fabricated birth certificate,"" said the cop.When the complainants asked Dr Namratha for the DNA report they found that it was not done before the registration of the baby on their name. However, the clinic representatives kept falsely assuring the couple that the child belonged to them.Suspicion arose when the couple opted for a DNA test of all three in a forensics lab in Vasant Kunj, Delhi, which revealed that neither of them shared any genetic link with the child.""When they tried to seek clarification from the clinic, Dr Namratha initially blocked their numbers before threatening them and denying access to further documentation,"" said the police official.She said that the couple, fed up with the clinic's behaviour, approached Gopalapuram police around a week ago and lodged a complaint.""With malicious intentions, the accused Dr Namratha did not let the complainant couple meet the biological mother, who they believed was the surrogate,"" said the DCPFollowing the complaint, the police, along with health dept officials, seized the fertility centre at Gopalapuram. Officials said they found equipment which substantiated the facts that the accused were offering IVF treatments, creating live embryos, and carrying out medical procedures without any proper license.""Previously, when health officials visited the clinic for inspection on a quarterly basis, it was closed and seemed to be a residential complex. But, it turns out, patients were coming discreetly,"" said Dr J Venkati, district medical health officer (DMHO), Hyderabad.The DMHO added: ""During the recent crackdown, equipment for sex determination and nitrous oxide were also found. Many other pregnancy-related procedures such as MTP, IVF, and others were also being performed by uncertified professionals at the centre.""The DCP alleged that clients who protested were intimidated and threatened by her advocate son, who ran an office from the same premises.", Hyderabad police arrest eight people including prime accused Dr Athaluri Namratha.

In a disturbing video footage from downtown Cincinnati, a man and a woman can be seen violently attacked during a chaotic brawl on Friday night, beaten mercilessly and pushed to the ground.The clip, which has since gone viral, shows the pair being swarmed by a crowd, with the white man appearing to be chased into the street, shoved to the ground and savagely kicked, punched and stomped on by several individuals. One attacker even body-slams him as others from the crowd, both men and women, continue to cheer and join in.The man, struggling to stand, is seen getting to his feet when a woman runs over to help him.However, just as she tries to pull one of the attackers away, she too, is punched twice in the face. The woman then falls back, hitting her head on the pavement and lying motionless as blood drips from her mouth. The crowd continues to jeer before the video ends.It remains unclear what sparked the violence. Witnesses told local station WXIX that racial slurs were exchanged before it began, although it is not clear who initiated the aggression.Some said the man had spoken to members of the group about 15 minutes earlier, before returning to the area, as reported by the New York Post.Cincinnati Police are actively investigating and attempting to identify everyone involved.“I am in complete disgust waking up to the viral video many of you have now seen,” said Cincinnati police chief Theresa Theetge in a statement on Saturday.“The behavior displayed is nothing short of cruel and absolutely unacceptable.”Ken Kober, President of the Cincinnati Fraternal Order of Police, strongly criticised not only the attackers but also the bystanders who failed to intervene.“The violence this video shows downtown is disgusting,” he told WLWT5. “What’s equally disgusting is those who chose to watch and record instead of calling 911, attempting to defuse the situation or render aid.”“I have full faith in the Central Business Section Investigators they will make arrests in the near future. It will then be the responsibility of the court system to hold these violent thugs accountable,” he added.The condition and identities of the victims have not yet been confirmed, but the police are trying to identify everyone in the video.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT.

Shane Devon Tamura, the 27-year-old suspected gunman in the deadly Midtown Manhattan office shooting, was originally from Hawaii and later moved to Las Vegas.

Tamura opened fire at a high-rise office building on Park Avenue on Monday evening, killing four civilians and an NYPD officer before turning the weapon on himself.

Commissioner Tisch confirmed Tamura had a ""documented mental health history,"" but no clear motive has been established yet. ""We are working to understand why he targeted this particular location,"" she said.

While an official biography is yet to be confirmed, unverified reports suggest Tamura was a former high school football player, having played as a running back at Granada Hills High School in California.

A former teammate, Caleb Clarke, described him as “a goofball” and “class clown,” full of energy, according to NBC.

A concealed carry permit issued in Las Vegas in July 2022, bearing Tamura’s photo, was found at the scene.

Surveillance footage showed him exiting a black BMW, armed with a .223-caliber Palmetto State Armory AR-15-style rifle equipped with a black scope, handguard, and shoulder sling.

The gun, priced around $420, was reportedly the same one used during the attack, New York Post reported.

Police said that Tamura first shot an officer stationed at the building's entrance, then opened fire on a woman trying to flee, followed by a security guard and another man inside the lobby.

He later shot himself at the scene. Police later found a revolver, ammunition, and extra magazines in his vehicle.

The shooting took place at 345 Park Avenue , a prominent high-rise that houses major institutions including Blackstone, the National Football League, and the Irish Consulate.

Q1: Where did the active shooter incident take place in New York?

Q2: Was the NFL Headquarters directly targeted during the shooting?



A quiet Monday evening in Midtown Manhattan turned into a horrifying scene as a mass shooting erupted inside 345 Park Avenue—a 44-story skyscraper that houses major firms including Blackstone, Bank of America, and the headquarters of the National Football League. The alleged gunman, now identified as 27-year-old Shane Devon Tamura from Las Vegas, left a trail of devastation before taking his own life.Authorities report that Shane Devon Tamura entered the building around 6:30 p.m., calmly carrying an AR-15-style rifle. Within minutes, multiple floors were under siege as gunfire echoed through the high-rise, sparking panic and chaos.Surveillance footage captured Tamura moving with apparent purpose, and his weapon, later found bloodied was used to fatally shoot that killed five people, including a New York City police officer. Several others remain hospitalized with critical injuries.Police responded rapidly, locking down the entire building and shutting off surrounding streets near East 51st Street and Park Avenue. Witnesses described scenes of terror, with workers fleeing under police instructions, hands raised, while others remained barricaded inside offices.Tamura is believed to have acted alone, NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said.“The scene has been contained and the lone shooter has been neutralized,” she wrote on X just over an hour after the chaos started.Tamura, who once played high school football as a standout running back in California, had no known ties to any of the tenants in the tower. However, his choice of location—home to the NFL’s New York headquarters—has sparked speculation. Law enforcement sources have not confirmed whether the NFL was the intended target, but the building’s high-profile status suggests the attack may have been premeditated.Tamura held a valid Nevada concealed carry permit set to expire in 2027. His vehicle, also registered in Nevada, was located near the scene, further confirming his identity. The shooter was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound on the 33rd floor.Authorities continue to comb through Tamura’s background and digital activity in search of motive. For now, the tragedy has reignited concerns over gun access, building security, and the safety of high-profile corporate spaces in urban centers.Also Read: Josh Allen’s MVP shine fades as fantasy football experts and Hailee Steinfeld question his real value The incident occurred in Midtown Manhattan, near the NFL Headquarters.As of now, there’s no official confirmation that the NFL Headquarters was specifically targeted.","A mass shooting occurred in Midtown Manhattan at 345 Park Avenue.

Long wait for asylum seekers to ger job permit in Canada, Ontario says they will bypass federal government







Canada will stop funding hotels for asylum seekers after September as the federal government already spent approximately $1,1 billion on temporary hotel housing since 2020. The Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada said it is funded to continue hotel operations only until September 30, 2025.

The department said it will help the 485 people remaining in the hotels find longer-term housing before the program ends on Sept. 30. It said it will support people on-site while they look for longer-term housing, and that it will continue ""supporting provinces and municipalities in developing their own long-term housing strategies.

'Documented mental history': Who was Shane Devon Tamura?



Shane Devon Tamura, the 27-year-old gunman behind Monday’s deadly Midtown Manhattan office shooting, was originally from Hawaii and had later settled in Las Vegas.

Tamura opened fire inside a Park Avenue high-rise during the evening rush, killing three civilians and an NYPD officer before turning the gun on himself—bringing the total death toll in the incident to five.

New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch confirmed that Tamura had a “documented mental health history,” though investigators have yet to determine a clear motive. “We are working to understand why he targeted this particular location,” she said.

While an official biography has not been released, unverified accounts suggest Tamura once played high school football as a running back at Granada Hills High School in California.

Speaking to NBC, former teammate Caleb Clarke remembered him as “a goofball” and “class clown,” always full of energy.





A routine Monday rush hour in Midtown Manhattan turned into a scene of terror as a lone gunman carried out a deadly shooting spree that left five people dead, including a police officer and the attacker himself.The first alert to New York’s 911 system came in at 6:00pm local time (2200 GMT), with frantic calls quickly flooding in.Police commissioner Jessica Tisch later provided a chilling reconstruction of the sequence of events during a press conference.S urveillance footage showed the suspect, 27-year-old Shane Tamura of Las Vegas, pulling up in a black BMW, double-parked on Park Avenue between 51st and 52nd Street.Armed with an M4 rifle, he crossed the street and entered a building, where the violence began almost immediately.""Turned right and immediately opened fire on an NYPD officer,"" Tisch said.

He continued toward the elevator bank, where he gunned down a security guard hiding behind a desk. Another man in the lobby was also shot; he survived and provided a statement to police from the hospital.Tisch said Tamura had driven cross-country from Las Vegas in just three days, and Nevada authorities had flagged a history of mental illness. After summoning an elevator, he let a woman pass by unharmed before riding to the 33rd floor - home to the offices of Rudin Management, a real estate firm.On that floor, Tamura ""begins to walk the floor, firing rounds as he travelled,"" said Tisch. One person was struck and killed there.The rampage ended when Tamura turned the gun on himself. ""He proceeds down a hallway and shoots himself in the chest,"" Tisch said.In total, the violence claimed the lives of four civilians, including gunman and one police officer. Another person remains in critical condition.According to ABC7 Eyewitness News, panic gripped office workers in the Midtown Manhattan building as the gunman made his way through the floors.

US vice president JD Vance praised Donald Trump for securing a major trade agreement with the European Union, saying European media outlets are applauding the deal.“The entire European press is singing the president’s praises right now, amazed at the deal he negotiated on behalf of Americans,” Vance said wrote on Sunday (local time) on social media platform X.However, he also drew a satire at American media houses, saying, “Tomorrow the American media will undoubtedly run headlines like ‘Donald Trump Only Got 99.9 Percent of What He Asked For’.”The remarks came after President Trump announced that the United States and the European Union had “reached a deal” on trade, calling it “a good deal for everybody.”Under the agreement, the US will impose a 15% tariff on products imported from the EU, a move aimed at averting a deeper trade rift. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen also described the outcome as “a good deal”, according to AFP.Speaking to reporters in Scotland, where the talks were held at Trump’s Turnberry golf resort, the president revealed that the EU has committed to $600 billion in new investments in the US, along with $750 billion in energy purchases.“It was a very interesting negotiation.

US federal authorities have taken down a massive dark web network trading child sexual abuse material, in what the justice department described as “one of the most successful” operations of its kind.The move has resulted in the conviction of at least 18 individuals across the United States.The man at the centre of the investigation, William Spearman, known online as “Boss,” was arrested in November 2022 during a high-risk raid on his home in Madison, Alabama.The search warrant for his arrest was deemed so critical it received direct approval from the FBI director himself. Agents breached his home using tactical explosives, and despite Spearman fighting back, with three handguns within arm’s reach, he was subdued and arrested.His capture marked a pivotal moment in Operation Grayskull, a years-long investigation that uncovered four of the most heavily trafficked child exploitation websites on the dark web. The FBI said these platforms were responsible for hosting and distributing hundreds of thousands of sexually exploitative images of children, with a million files, having over 120,000 members and recording upwards of 100,000 visits in a single day.“This is one of the most successful of all time,” said Matthew Galeotti, head of the justice department’s criminal division.“We dismantled four websites that have not regenerated.”Spearman pleaded guilty a year after his arrest and has since been sentenced to life imprisonment. Prosecutors described him as “one of the most significant” distributors of child sex abuse material globally.A sentencing memo noted that his refusal to surrender peacefully stemmed from the troves of incriminating evidence on his devices. “The devices at his desk contained massive quantities of evidence proving that he was the lead administrator of Website A,” the memo cited by CBS News said.“Unsurprisingly, the defendant's devices also contained an enormous collection of images and videos depicting the rape and abuse of children.”The investigation began in 2020 after authorities observed an alarming increase in traffic to a suspected dark web child abuse site. That discovery quickly led to a broader international operation, exposing a deeply embedded and technologically advanced network of abusers.“These are people who have a more of a technical understanding,” Galeotti said. “The defendants in this case, as sadistic as they may be, are somewhat sophisticated,” noting the use of encryption and other evasive tools.Among those convicted was Selwyn Rosenstein, who in 2022 was sentenced to 28 years in prison. His platform, prosecutors said, “was not simply a website; it was a large, active community of pedophiles and (abuse material) enthusiasts. And it existed in part because of the Defendant's criminal acts.”Rosenstein stored so many illicit images that he needed to keep some on servers tied to his business operations.Another key figure, Matthew Garrell from Raleigh, North Carolina, was jailed for 20 years. Prosecutors revealed that Garrell had built an “extremely complex and technologically sophisticated conspiracy,” complete with a predator’s “handbook” containing detailed child grooming instructions.Members of these dark web communities were often required to contribute abusive content, pay membership fees, or assist with site moderation to gain access. “They were part of an online community of hundreds of thousands of people, with leadership roles, rules and a common dedicated purpose,” said Chris Delzotto, acting FBI deputy assistant director.“Few people would have envisioned how (child abuse materials) would permeate the internet, the way it has today,” he added.The FBI has confirmed that the same leadership team operated several of the shuttered sites. Abbigail Beccaccio, an FBI unit chief, said, “The leadership team that operated one of the sites also operated several of the others.”The scope of Operation Grayskull extended nationwide, with convicted individuals hailing from Virginia, Maryland, Indiana, Texas, Washington, Arkansas, Michigan, and Oklahoma. The Department of Justice is hailing the takedown as a major victory in its ongoing fight against online child exploitation.“Even for prosecutors, it is difficult to understand how pervasive this is,” Galeotti said. “Because it happens on the dark web, people aren’t aware of it. It’s extremely troubling.”","US federal authorities have taken down a massive dark web network trading child sexual abuse material.

'Murderers, Rapists Welcomed': Trump Ally Ted Cruz Torches Dems, Biden Over 'Criminal Aliens'





Former President Joe Biden has secured a deal with Little, Brown & Co. to pen a memoir about his White House tenure. Industry executives revealed that the untitled book, acquired through an auction by the Hachette imprint, garnered a £10 million advance, as initially reported by The Wall Street Journal.President Biden hinted that his memoir will cover his four years as President, according to NY Post.Diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer in May, the 82-year-old Biden has discussed the project at various public gatherings, expressing urgency to complete it amidst his health challenges. At a San Diego event, he stated that he was ""working like hell with a publisher"" to research and expedite a memoir focusing on his presidential period.While former presidents traditionally publish accounts of their time in office, Biden's memoir offers an opportunity to address concerns about his physical and mental capabilities, alongside presenting his presidential narrative.At an event earlier this month, Biden said that he was “working my tail off” to write a memoir. He was represented by Creative Artists Agency, which sold the worldwide rights for the book to Hachette.The agency also represented Biden for his 2017 memoir “Promise Me, Dad: A Year of Hope, Hardship and Purpose,” which chronicled his final year with his eldest son, Beau, who died from brain cancer in 2015.Having achieved his long-held presidential ambition, Biden became the oldest incumbent upon his January 2020 inauguration. He later withdrew from the 2024 electoral race amid growing concerns about his capacity to serve.Subsequently, discussions have centred on whether his close associates and party overlooked his apparent decline.Also read: Hillary Clinton flagged concerns on Biden's 'viability' before re-election bid; ex-NSA Jake Sullivan also approached Ron Klain Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson's ""Original Sin"", a significant non-fiction release this year, examines how Biden's protective inner circle disregarded his fragility, potentially compromising Democratic electoral prospects. The book achieved considerable success, with nearly 100,000 print copies sold according to Circana BookScan. Conservative publishers have responded with publications focusing on controversies surrounding his son Hunter.Presidential memoirs typically command eight-figure advances, valued for prestige as much as sales potential. Biden's memoir, however, is considerably valued lower than his peers. Barack and Michelle Obama notably secured approximately £60 million from Penguin Random House in 2017.Both Obama books achieved remarkable success: ""A Promised Land"" exceeded 2.8 million hardcover sales, while ""Becoming"" surpassed 5 million print copies, per Circana BookScan. Bill Clinton's 2004 ""My Life"" and George W. Bush's ""Decision Points"" also achieved significant commercial success with substantial advances.However, the political non-fiction market has evolved, becoming increasingly divided. Recent publications analysing the 2024 election have struggled to attract broad readership.Biden's 2017 publication ""Promise Me, Dad"", chronicling his son Beau's death from brain cancer, balanced political content with personal loss and achieved bestseller status. Other Biden family members, including his sister Valerie Biden Owens and son Hunter, have published memoirs. Jill Biden authored a 2019 memoir about their family life and several children's books.","Former President Joe Biden has secured a deal with Little, Brown & Co. to pen a memoir about his White House tenure.

US President in Scotland: Did Trump cheat at a golf game? Caddie's video goes viral,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-president-in-scotland-did-trump-cheat-at-a-golf-game-caddies-video-goes-viral/articleshow/122945495.cms,"Big Trump 'Security Breach': Protesters Enter Golf Course Vicinity In Scotland; Cops Did This Next

Poll Should golf etiquette rules be strictly enforced among all players? Yes, every player should follow the rules. No, some flexibility is acceptable.





A video from President Donald Trump’s recent golf trip to Scotland has stirred a social media storm, with fresh accusations of cheating on the course.The footage, filmed during Trump’s visit to his Turnberry resort on 26–27 July 2025, shows a caddie discreetly dropping a ball in the rough. While Trump himself is not seen hitting the shot in question, the clip has gone viral, fuelling debate online about whether the US president once again bent the rules of the game.President Trump, 79, was in Scotland over the weekend, having just announced a major tariffs agreement with the European Union, one of America’s most significant trading partners.But alongside his official duties, he also made time to play 18 holes each day at Trump Turnberry, the golf course he owns and hopes will host a future British Open.The viral video has sparked long-standing claims that Trump routinely cheats at golf, accusations that have been echoed by those who have played with him in the past.So, did the US President actually cheat? Here is what his fellow players have to say.Jack O’Donnell, who worked as vice president at Trump Plaza Casino in Atlantic City, recalled what his late colleague, Mark Eddis, once said about golfing with Trump.“So, does he improve his lie?” O'Donnell asked Eddis, according to sportswriter Rick Reilly.“Every shot but the tee shot,"" Eddis reportedly replied with a laugh as reported by The Spun.Improving one’s lie, moving the ball to a better position, is considered a breach of golf etiquette, even among casual players. While it may happen informally, it’s certainly frowned upon when someone lays claim to multiple club championships, as Trump does.Another former playing partner, Bryan Marsal, a longtime member of Winged Foot Golf Club, shared his own experience with the president.“I played with him once,” Marsal said, as cited by The Spun.“It was a Saturday morning game. We go to the first tee and he couldn’t have been nicer. But then he said, ‘You see those two guys? They cheat. See me? I cheat. And I expect you to cheat because we’re going to beat those two guys today.’… So, yes, it’s true, he’s going to cheat you. But I think Donald, in his heart of hearts, believes that you’re gonna cheat him, too. So if it’s the same, if everybody’s cheating, he doesn’t see it as really cheating. ”Online, the reaction to the video has been predictably split.“And you are surprised? he did that all his life,” wrote one user on social media platform X.“It’s not cheating when you own the course,” one user joked.Some users could also be seen defending the US President, “Why did you stop the video? It doesn’t show him cheating, because it doesn’t show him hitting the ball.”“Every single golfer has done this, multiple times,” argued another.Some have demanded the full uncut version of the video, insisting that the brief clip doesn’t provide conclusive evidence. Others, meanwhile, said that the move is a common one on the golf course and not worth the fuss.","A video from President Donald Trump's recent golf trip to Scotland has stirred a social media storm, with fresh accusations of cheating.

Indian-origin, Democratic Mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani on Monday reacted to the Midtown Manhattan office shooting from Uganda saying he was ""heartbroken"" by the deadly incident.Sharing a post on X Mamdani said, ""I’m heartbroken to learn of the horrific shooting in midtown and I am holding the victims, their families, and the NYPD officer in critical condition in my thoughts. """"Grateful for all of our first responders on the ground,"" he added.Mamdani is currently in Uganda, celebrating his wedding at a heavily guarded private estate in the upscale Buziga Hill area near Kampala.A mass shooting at a Midtown Manhattan office tower on Monday evening left five people dead, including a New York City police officer, and the suspect, with a sixth victim critically injured.The suspected gunman, identified as Shane Tamura from Las Vegas died at the scene from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to authorities.Mayor Eric Adams called the attack a ""senseless act of violence"" and said officials are still working to understand the motive. ""We lost four souls to another act of senseless violence,"" Adams said at a late-night briefing, excluding the gunman from the death toll.NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch confirmed Tamura had a ""documented mental health history,"" but no clear motive has been established yet. ""We are working to understand why he targeted this particular location,"" she added.The shooting unfolded at 345 Park Avenue, a prominent high-rise that houses major institutions including Blackstone, the National Football League, and the Irish Consulate.Surveillance footage showed Tamura pulling up in a double-parked black BMW, stepping out with an M-4-style rifle, and walking into the building.According to Tisch, Tamura immediately opened fire at the entrance, shooting a uniformed officer before turning the weapon on others inside.A woman who tried to flee was gunned down, followed by a security guard behind a desk and another man in the lobby.Tamura was armed with a .223-caliber Palmetto State Armory AR-15-style assault rifle.

US President Donald Trump on Monday claimed credit for brokering peace between Cambodia and Thailand by leveraging trade deals.In an interview, Trump said that his administration began a series of discussions with both countries and “settled” the conflict “within less than a day.”""You know, they've had many conflicts and wars over the years. When I spoke to them, they said, 500 years. They said, that's a lot. But now it was raging, and raging hard. People were being killed at the border a lot. And I said to Thailand—we're doing a trading deal, and I'm not going to do a deal if you're going to be killing each other. And I spoke to Cambodia—said essentially the same thing. I dealt with the two prime ministers,"" Trump said.""But somebody had to implement what I did. And we started a series of discussions—back and forth, back and forth. And within less than a day, we have it settled. And I guess now, based on what you're saying, they've just said we're going to have peace. That's great. Millions of people are going to be saved. You know, those wars turn out to be a disaster. Millions of people get killed, and it's total disruption, and it takes them 40 years to recover.And we were able to stop it before it really started—although, you know, a lot of people have already been killed,"" he added.Earlier on Sunday, Trump declared himself the ""President of Peace"" and claimed personal credit for brokering the ceasefire between the two countries.The ceasefire announcement followed five days of fierce fighting along the disputed jungle border between Thailand and Cambodia, which killed at least 36 people and displaced nearly 300,000. The truce was officially declared in Kuala Lumpur after peace talks mediated by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, the current chair of the ASEAN bloc.Trump had earlier warned both countries that the US would not proceed with trade negotiations if the conflict dragged on.“We happen to be, by coincidence, currently dealing on trade with both countries, but do not want to make any deal… if they are fighting — and I have told them so!” he posted over the weekend.Trump also likened the situation to the past conflict between India and Pakistan, which he claimed to have resolved successfully.“This very much reminds me of the conflict between Pakistan and India, which was brought to a successful halt,” he wrote.Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet publicly thanked Trump for his “decisive support,” calling the peace deal “a foundation for future de-escalation.” The decades-long territorial dispute between the two countries flared up again last week, with both sides trading blame for triggering the latest violence. The disputed region—home to ancient temples and dense forest—has long been a flashpoint.While the ceasefire has brought temporary relief, military commanders from both sides are scheduled to meet on Tuesday to discuss next steps, followed by a cross-border committee meeting on August 4 in Cambodia.",US President Donald Trump claimed credit for brokering peace between Cambodia and Thailand.

T he US has likely stationed nuclear weapons in the UK for the first time since 2008, in a signal to Russian President Vladimir Putin that it remains committed to European security.On July 16, a US military aircraft flew with its transponder on - making its identification and location publicly visible - from a US nuclear weapons depot at Kirtland air force base in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to an airbase in the UK city of Lakenheath, according to defence analysts and open-source data.The C-17 flight involved the US air force's Prime Nuclear Airlift Force, which transports nuclear weapons, and didn't fly over any other nation's territory, according to William Alberque, a Europe-based senior fellow at Pacific Forum.

Three Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants were killed in an encounter with Pakistani security forces in Karachi, officials confirmed on Monday.Among those killed was Zafran, who was identified as the mastermind of a November 2024 attack on two Chinese engineers in Pakistan's largest city. He carried a bounty of Rs 20 million.The operation was conducted late Sunday night in the Manghopir area by the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) and intelligence agencies, CTD official Raja Umer Khattab told. The TTP men opened fire when they saw security personnel approaching, triggering a firefight which lasted over an hour.Authorities recovered a suicide jacket, three grenades, a Kalashnikov rifle, two pistols, and a large quantity of ammunition from the site.On November 5 last year, a private security guard opened fire on two Chinese nationals at a textile mill in Karachi, injuring both before fleeing.Pakistan has witnessed a sharp increase in militant attacks—particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan—since the TTP ended its ceasefire with the federal government in late 2022.Founded in 2007, the TTP is an umbrella organisation of various extremist groups seeking to impose a strict version of Islamic law across Pakistan.

Pakistan tribal council threatens highway block over girl’s murder,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-tribal-council-threatens-highway-block-over-girls-murder/articleshow/122939897.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: A tribal jirga (council of elders) in Pakistan’s Tank district has threatened to block a stretch of Indus Highway on July 29 after the killing of a nine-year-old girl sparked public outrage. Convened in Tank’s Gul Imam on Saturday, the jirga issued an 11-point charter of demands, warning of a full blockade if authorities fail to respond.Indus Highway (N-55) is a critical national artery that runs along the river, connecting Karachi in Pakistan’s south with Peshawar in the north and cutting through multiple provinces. The planned blockade at Pezu will impact trade routes, passenger transport, and military convoys.The protests gained momentum after a viral video showed residents confronting armed security personnel -- an extraordinary act in this militarised stretch of southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The footage amplified long-standing anger over arbitrary detentions, raids without warrants, and what locals call collective punishment disguised as counterterrorism.“Our decision to block the highway remains. If our demands are accepted, we’ll reconsider.If not, Pezu will be shut down on July 29,” jirga leader Abdul Qayum Kundi said.Police have registered a case in the girl’s death, but authorities have yet to disclose any findings. Locals allege misconduct or negligence by security forces—claims that remain unverified but widely believed within the community.In a bid to defuse tensions, local officials delivered three sheep and (Pak) Rs 2.5 million (around $9,000) to the girl’s family -- an act rooted in tribal custom, meant to symbolise remorse and reconciliation. But jirga members view it as a token gesture. “This is hush money in ceremonial form,” said one elder.The jirga’s demands include the release of detainees not proven to have militant ties, an end to forced house searches, and a halt to arrests of suspects’ relatives. They also call for the return of confiscated weapons and an end to detentions based on vague accusations of mukhbiri (spying).The jirga’s demands echo those of the banned Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM), which for years challenged Pakistan’s security policies in its tribal belt.","A tribal jirga in Pakistan’s Tank district has threatened to block a stretch of Indus Highway.

‘Reject Pakistani Rule’: BNM Accuses Pakistan of Genocide in Balochistan, Launches Armed Resistance

Poll Do you think that protests and appeals by families of the abducted individuals can lead to change? Yes, they can raise awareness. No, they are largely ineffective.





The crisis of enforced disappearances in Pakistan's Balochistan region and beyond has deepened this week, as a disturbing string of abductions emerges from Karachi, Noshki, and Kech, according to The Balochistan Post (TBP).Among the most alarming cases is that of Muslim Dad Baloch, a fourth-semester philosophy student at the University of Karachi.On Monday evening, he was reportedly abducted near the university's Maskan Gate. Eyewitnesses say he was taken by unidentified men in a vehicle while returning to his hostel with friends.Originally from Mashkay in Awaran district, Muslim Dad was a familiar face within the Baloch student community in Karachi. His sudden disappearance has sparked fear among his peers and left his family devastated.In Noshki, another troubling case unfolded earlier today when Hafeezullah, the son of Peer Mohammad and a resident of Qaziabad, was allegedly picked up from his home by Pakistani security forces. His family has raised alarm over his unknown whereabouts and is demanding his immediate release.TBP also reported two recent disappearances in Kech district.On July 23, 16-year-old shopkeeper Qambar Baloch was allegedly taken by men believed to belong to Military Intelligence and the ISI while he was in Jusak, Turbat. And on June 27, Imran Khan, a 26-year-old student of Balochi language and culture at the University of Turbat, was reportedly abducted by Frontier Corps and Military Intelligence personnel in Turbat city—in broad daylight.“These are not isolated cases. This is a pattern,” said a representative from Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP), a group that has long campaigned for the safe recovery of abducted individuals. Despite repeated appeals and protests, most cases remain unresolved, with no accountability or formal investigations.","Muslim Dad Baloch, a fourth-semester philosophy student at the University of Karachi, was reportedly abducted on Monday.

Pakistan Blames India For Tensions, Credits Trump For Ceasefire Between Nuclear Rivals





Beijing/Islamabad: Pakistan army chief Asim Munir, who is on his first visit to China after his elevation as the field marshal, on Friday held talks with top Chinese leaders and discussed ways to deepen cooperation across all sectors. Munir held separate meetings with V-P Han Zheng, top military official general Zhang Youxia and foreign minister Wang Yi, according to official media reports.This is Munir's first visit to China after India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terrorist infrastructure in Pakistam in response to the Pahalgam terror attack. During the conflict, Pakistan used extensive military equipment supplied by China. This is also Munir's first visit to China after his trip to Washington, where he met US President Trump and sought to establish close ties with America, Beijing's strategic rival.The visit coincides with Pakistan's foreign minister Ishaq Dar making a trip to Washington, where he is expected to meet US secretary of state Marco Rubio. Dar was in China July 14 to attend Shanghai Cooperation Organisation foreign ministers' meeting.A Pakistan military statement said that in their talks, the ""Chinese leadership lauded Pakistan armed forces as a cornerstone of resilience and a vital contributor to peace in South Asia.

ISLAMABAD: As jailed former PM Imran Khan completes two years in prison, his sons – Sulaiman and Qasim – have stepped into the political spotlight, launching an aggressive lobbying campaign in the United States to press for their father’s release just days before Khan’s call for a nationwide protest on Aug 5, which has put the state on edge.Khan, arrested on Aug 5, 2023, remains behind bars despite some convictions being overturned. He is currently serving time in three major cases that his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), claims are part of a broader effort to keep him out of politics.He was convicted in the Toshakhana case, involving the illegal sale of state gifts received during his premiership. He was sentenced in the cipher case, accused of leaking classified diplomatic correspondence for political gain. And in the Al-Qadir Trust case, Khan and his wife were held liable for controversial land deals linked to a charitable trust.PTI has consistently maintained that the charges are politically motivated, aimed at “eliminating the most popular leader” in the country.Now, with most of PTI’s senior leadership jailed, exiled, or forced to resign, Khan’s sons have taken the international route. Based in the UK, the brothers have held meetings in Washington DC with US lawmakers, policy groups and human rights organisations, and are reportedly preparing to testify before congressional panels.Their message: Imran Khan is being held in solitary confinement in inhumane conditions, denied light, medical access, and family contact.The campaign has triggered speculation about whether the two sons might return to Pakistan, possibly to appear at the planned protest. While PTI has not confirmed this, party insiders say their presence could act as a powerful morale boost for the party’s dispersed support base.Meanwhile, the state has moved swiftly to neutralise any protest momentum. On July 22, an anti-terror court in Lahore sentenced eight senior PTI leaders, including Dr Yasmin Rashid, to 10 years in prison for their alleged role in the May 9 riots, when military installations were targeted after Khan’s initial arrest. Observers see the convictions as a tactical strike to undercut mobilisation ahead of the Aug 5 protest. The verdicts have raised concerns among legal experts about the selective use of terrorism laws against political opponents.From prison, Khan has issued a call for unity among PTI ranks, urging supporters to “shun differences” and prepare for what he called a decisive moment for Pakistan’s democracy. But the party remains fractured and leaderless, with ongoing rifts between loyalists and factions seen as open to negotiations with the establishment.At the heart of the political storm is the army chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir, who was controversially elevated to five-star rank in May. PTI blames him, along with PML-N and PPP leaders, for orchestrating what it calls a civil-military clampdown to sideline Khan and crush dissent.In a recent prison note, Khan mocked Munir as the “King of the Jungle”, accusing him of ruling the country through “fear, not law”.","Sulaiman and Qasim Khan have launched an aggressive lobbying campaign in the United States to press for their father’s release.

'Broken system, easy to manipulate'







A visa fraud network is being run by some Pakistani consultants who are exploiting loopholes in the UK immigration system, with one firm claiming a “98% success” rate for entry, according to a report by The Telegraph.The investigation found that forged documents, including fake CVs, employment letters, and bank statements, were being sold for up to £50,000 to secure work and student visas. These materials, riddled with basic errors, were being waved through by the UK home office, enabling illegal but technically “legal” entry into Britain.The report revealed that a widespread visa fraud operation targeting Britain’s immigration system, orchestrated by Pakistani consultants, with one guarantying entry into the UK with ""98% success"".""Syed Kamran Haider, the chief executive of Mirpur Visa Consultant (MVC) in the Pakistan-administered region of Kashmir, was found to be operating openly online, where he advertises loopholes in the UK asylum system, which experts described as 'easy to manipulate',"" the report said.MVC was charging thousands of pounds to fabricate documents such as fake CVs and bank statements for visa applicants. These falsified materials were used to meet UK immigration criteria.One such forged application, including a bogus employment letter from a non-existent hospital riddled with grammatical errors, was successfully used to secure a UK work visa, it said.UK-based immigration lawyer Harjap Bhangal blamed the nation's ""broken system"" which was ""easy to manipulate"".“If you claim asylum before that visa runs out, you can still work. The Home Office is a broken institution... They are not realising where the loopholes are [and] what is being done, what migrants are doing,” The Telegraph quoted him as saying.“These visa ‘consultants’ are “selling them a dream,” he said, adding: “[They are] selling a product essentially to people who don’t want to come back [home]. They have found their market. [It’s] quite a sophisticated scam.”Last year, Pakistanis filed 10,542 asylum applications in the UK, the highest from any single nationality and an 80% surge from the previous year, the report said citing government data. Despite these soaring numbers, Pakistanis rarely featured among the top 10 nationalities crossing into Britain via small boats, suggesting they were entering through legal visa channels, and staying there.","Visa fraud network being run by some Pakistani consultants exploiting loopholes in the UK immigration system. forged documents, including fake CVs, employment letters, and bank statements, were being sold for up to £50,000 to secure work and student visas.
