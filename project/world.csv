NEW DELHI: Congress general secretary in charge of communications Jairam Ramesh urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to consult opposition leaders and political heads on the ""extremely sensitive and critical"" matter of bilateral relations with Canada.Amid escalating tensions between the two nations, Ramesh said in a post on X, “The Indian National Congress certainly hopes and expects that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will take into confidence the Leaders of the Opposition in both Houses of Parliament and the leaders of other political parties on this extremely sensitive and critical issue of India-Canada relations .”This comes after a significant diplomatic move earlier on Monday, when India expelled six Canadian diplomats.The ministry of external affairs (MEA) summoned Canada's Charge d'Affaires, Stewart Wheeler, to convey India's strong objection to what it described as the ""baseless targeting"" of its diplomats in Canada. The government made it clear that the actions against its officials were unacceptable.Canada too, on Monday, expelled six Indian diplomats in relation to what it said was ""a targeted campaign against Canadian citizens by agents linked to the Government of India"".In a statement, the MEA announced the expulsion of six Canadian diplomats, including Stewart Wheeler, Acting High Commissioner, and several other high-ranking officials. “They have been asked to leave India by or before 11:59 pm on Saturday, October 19, 2024,” the statement read.This diplomatic standoff follows allegations from Canadian law enforcement authorities. Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Commissioner Mike Duheme claimed that they had uncovered information linking agents of the Indian government to criminal activities, including threats against the South Asian community, particularly those affiliated with the pro-Khalistan movement.Duheme further alleged that Indian diplomats had used their official positions to conduct “clandestine operations”, gathering information and engaging in other covert activities in Canada.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that his government has shared all relevant information about these allegations with its Five Eyes partners, particularly the United States. The allegations center around the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Canadian national and designated terrorist by India’s National Investigation Agency (NIA), who was killed outside a gurdwara in Surrey in June 2023.Relations between the two nations have deteriorated sharply since Trudeau's parliamentary address last year, where he claimed ""credible allegations"" of India's involvement in Nijjar’s killing. India has vehemently denied the accusations, branding them as “absurd” and “motivated.” In its response, the MEA said that Canada has allowed extremist and anti-India elements to thrive on its soil, further straining diplomatic ties.The MEA also warned that India reserves the right to take further actions in response to what it describes as the Trudeau government's support for extremist and separatist activities against India.As diplomatic relations between the two nations continue to sour, all eyes are on the Indian government to see whether Prime Minister Modi will heed the opposition's call for broader consultations on the issue.","Congress general secretary in charge of communications Jairam Ramesh urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to consult opposition leaders and political heads.

"Baba Siddique murder: Shubham Lonkar quizzed in Salman firing case in May, but let off",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/baba-siddique-murder-shubham-lonkar-quizzed-in-salman-firing-case-in-may-but-let-off/articleshow/114229034.cms,"MUMBAI/NAGPUR: The killing of Baba Siddique could potentially have been prevented if Mumbai police crime branch had investigated key suspect Shubham Lonkar and not let him go in the case of firing on Salman Khan ’s flat, sources in the police said.In June, crime branch had questioned Shubham from Pune for providing shelter to suspects in the Salman firing case. However, he was allowed to go after questioning citing lack of strong evidence.Now, during the investigations, when Shubham’s name has cropped up, Mumbai police commissioner Vivek Phansalkar got agitated and pulled up crime branch officers who investigated the case, sources said.An aspiring soldier, Shubham had failed the Indian Army recruitment test at Jaisalmer in 2018-19, and later entered the world of crime. His first fling with the law was as a teenager, when he was booked for assault by Akot police. Arrested seven years later in Jan this year with his elder brother, Pravin, for hoarding arms and cartridges, he was later bailed out.Earlier in May this year, members of the Bishnoi gang had fired at Khan’s residence in Bandra, and the crime branch had arrested five members of the gang — Vikas Gupta, Sagar Pal, Harpal Singh alias Harry, Rafiq Choudhary, and Banwarilal Gujar. The sixth accused, Anuj Thappan, died in police custody. During their interrogation, police came across the name of Shubham alias Shubbu Lonkar from Pune, who provided the accused shelter. The crime branch’s anti-extortion cell brought in Shubham and interrogated him at length, and after finding little evidence of his involvement in the crime, he was allowed to go, said sources.Sources said this lapse might have allowed Lonkar to remain active and involved in subsequent criminal activities, particularly to recruit fresh shooters and hatch a plot to kill Siddiqui on behalf of the Bishnoi gang. Police are still trying to figure out how Shubam came in contact with Bishnoi. It was Shubam who tweeted on social media, claiming responsibility for the killing of Siddiqui by the Bishnoi gang. Sources said absconding accused Zeeshan Akhtar could be the link between Bishnoi and Shubham, which needs to be probed.Police have arrested Shubham’s brother, Pravin, after finding his role in the attack on Siddique. The Lonkars run a milk dairy in Pune. The two arrested accused, Dharmaraj Kashyap and another wanted accused, Shivkumar Gautam, worked in a scrap shop next to Lonkars’.A now-deleted Facebook post by ‘Shubuu Lonkar Maharashtra’, which linked the murder to Bishnoi gang, dramatically shifted the focus of investigation to a radicalised son of a farmer from a nondescript Nivri Budruk village in Vidarbha’s Akola district. The post, according to police sources, was made by an underground Shubham Lonkar, prompting Mumbai police to launch a manhunt for him.Though Pravin was nabbed after Siddique’s murder, probe agencies are clueless about Shubham’s whereabouts. Sources said Lonkar brothers played a key role in planning and executing Siddique’s murder by hiring assailants from across India, supplying them with weapons & providing logistical support.","In June, crime branch had questioned Shubham from Pune for providing shelter to suspects in the Salman firing case.

MUMBAI: The two suspects caught for the murder of former state minister and NCP politician Baba Siddique have told police that they had been instructed to eliminate his Congress MLA son Zeeshan, too, if he was spotted during the crime.During their preliminary interrogation, the duo, Dharmaraj Kashyap and Gurmail Singh, revealed the order was to kill one of the targets.However, if they encountered Siddique and Zeeshan together, they were to target both, a police official said. ""This points to a more coordinated and far-reaching plot, with the attack potentially serving as a message to high-profile figures, including actor Salman Khan ,"" the official added.Sources said Zeeshan had written to the state intelligence department in Sept expressing fear for his life. As a sitting MLA, Zeeshan already had a police officer for protection. But after his request, Mumbai police forwarded his letter to SID for a security audit, following which SID increased Zeeshan’s security. Police are examining what prompted Zeeshan to seek enhanced security, and whether that deterred the shooters from attacking him as he had left his office just minutes before his father did on the day of the attack.“Around the second week of Sept, Zeeshan’s security was enhanced from one police guard to Y-plus security, which includes three armed constables providing round-the-clock protection,” a police source confirmed. “We were not in the picture as Zeeshan’s security was increased by SID,” said another policeman.This past Saturday, Zeeshan informed his father that he was heading out to a nearby eatery with friends. Shortly after, Baba Siddique was preparing to leave his office when the shooters, who had been lying in wait for about half an hour, struck. Siddique was attacked in the presence of a lone cop, Shyam Sonawane. Cops said the arrest of key individuals such as Shubam Lonkar and Zeeshan Akhtar could shed more light on the motive behind the attack.Meanwhile, Navi Mumbai police have reviewed the security at Salman Khan’s farmhouse in Waje village, Panvel, following the murder of Siddique, who was close to the actor. Police said security around this house will be increased whenever Khan or his family members visit the place. They are pursuing leads that suggest the murder was a contract killing carried out at the behest of jailed gangster Lawrence Bishnoi.(Inputs by Umesh Parida)","Two suspects in Baba Siddique's murder told police they had been instructed to eliminate his Congress MLA son Zeeshan, too.

BABA SIDDIQUE SHOT DEAD | NCP Leader & Ex-Maharashtra Minister Killed In Mumbai | Watch

Who Was Baba Siddique?

He was born to Abdul Rahim Siddique and Razia Siddique. Baba Siddique is married to Shehzeen Siddique, and they have two children, Dr. Arshia Siddique and Zeeshan Siddique.

Siddique entered politics by joining the Indian National Congress in 1977 as a teenager. In 1980, he became General Secretary of the Bandra Taluka Youth Congress, and by 1982, he had risen to the position of President of the Bandra Taluka Youth Congress, a role he held until 1992.

In 1988, he was elected President of the Mumbai Youth Congress. His political career advanced further when, in 1992, he was elected as a Municipal Councillor in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).

Baba Siddique was elected as a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for three successive terms. His first term began in 1999, followed by his re-election in 2004. He secured his third consecutive term in 2009.

From 2000 to 2004, he served as Chairman of the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA) Mumbai Board. Between 2004 and 2008, he was appointed Minister of State for Food & Civil Supplies, Labour, FDA, and Consumer Protection in the Maharashtra government.

Throughout his career, Siddique was involved in various student movements and youth leadership within the Congress party. He was also known for championing urban development and social welfare projects in Mumbai, including the creation of an Eco-Garden in Bandra-Khar in 2011.

Siddique joined Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) after quitting Congress in February this year.

Baba Siddique , born Ziauddin Siddique, was a seasoned politician from Mumbai, who joined Ajit Pawar's NCP after long-standing association with the Indian National Congress (INC).

Supporters were left “stranded” for hours in hot and humid conditions during a Donald Trump rally in Coachella Valley , California which was spoiled by another suspected assassination attempt on the former president, as reported by the Independent. The event, held on Saturday, faced numerous issues from the beginning, including an altercation with a heckler and the arrest of an armed man outside the venue, believed to have multiple identities.Authorities suggested that Trump might have been the target of a third assassination attempt in three months.Although thousands of supporters were transported on buses to Calhoun Ranch, five miles from the parking area, many attendees said the event organisers did not arrange transport for the return trip. After Trump concluded his one-and-a-half-hour speech, supporters were left waiting in 93°F heat, according to footage posted on social media platform X.“Apparently the buses are no longer coming,” said one attendee in a video taken more than three hours after the rally ended. “There used to be like 20 buses when we were being brought here, but now there’s only like three buses operating.” Another attendee said that there was “only one bus in rotation,” which took half an hour for each drop-off.Footage from the event captured frustrated Trump supporters waiting in the heat, with one attendee criticising the organisers for their “failures.” The Tennessee Holler shared that many of those left waiting were elderly.While Trump claimed on Truth Social that 100,000 people attended the rally in California—a state led by vice president Kamala Harris by almost 27% according to The Hill—local reports indicated that the Riverside County permit limited capacity to 15,000. The former president’s campaign faced backlash online for the apparent organisational failures, with critics questioning his ability to lead the country.","Supporters were left ""stranded"" for hours in hot and humid conditions during a Donald Trump rally in Coachella Valley.

According to the Daily Beast, lawyers for the sexual assault victims filed six more lawsuits against Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs on Monday.The complaints filed on Monday involve allegations of victims who were assaulted in New York, where Diddy established his East Coast hip-hop empire.The victims will remain unidentified and unnamed in the lawsuits and will be referred to as John Doe and Jane Doe.The six victims are represented by Texas-based attorney Tony Buzbee, who has previously indicated plans to file lawsuits for as many as 120 people accusing the Bad Boy Records founder of various crimes, including sexual assault and the abuse of minors.In a statement, Buzbee’s office said they would “let the allegations in the filed complaints speak for themselves.” The attorney also said they “expect to be filing many more cases over the next several weeks naming Mr. Combs and others as defendants as we continue to gather evidence and prepare the filings.”In a series of lawsuits, multiple accusers have come forward with allegations against Diddy, detailing incidents from various events.A woman claimed that during a 1995 promotional party for Biggie Smalls’ “One More Chance” video, Diddy raped her after isolating her under the threat of harm if she reported it.After the rape , the victim claimed that Diddy told her: “you better not tell anyone about this, or you will disappear.”An accuser who was a minor when he was assaulted, identified only as John Doe, claims Diddy invited him to a White Party in the Hamptons in 1998. During the event, Diddy allegedly took an interest in the teen, leading him to a secluded area near portable restrooms to discuss his music career.However, the conversation took a disturbing turn when Diddy allegedly demanded he drop his pants and then groped him before returning to the party.In a separate lawsuit , a security guard at a 2006 White Party claims Diddy provided him with drinks, the second drink caused him to feel “extremely ill and [the victim] leaned against his truck for support.” Lawyers for the plaintiff believe that the drink was spiked with GHB—a dangerous date rape drug .The suit alleges Diddy then raped him after pushing him into a van.In 2004, a woman claimed she was invited to an afterparty at a Marriott hotel after a photoshoot for Diddy’s group Da Band.Once there, a security guard allegedly locked her and a friend in a room with Diddy, who forced them to drink and do cocaine before assaulting them.Marriott Hotels has been named as a co-defendant in the lawsuit. In a statement to the Daily Beast, the hotel chain stated that they have not yet reviewed the complaint and have no comment at this time.Another suit involves an Ecko Clothing advisor who met Diddy in a Macy’s stockroom in 2008.The victim alleges Diddy assaulted him, yelling obscenities, and left as if nothing had happened. The lawsuit claims that Macy’s “pressured Ecko executives to terminate the Plaintiff’s employment after Macy’s signed a multi-million-dollar deal with Sean John Clothing.” As a result, the victim was fired, and no further actions were pursued.Macy’s was also named as a co-defendant.A recent lawsuit details an incident involving a brand management employee at a party in October 2021.Despite limiting himself to one drink, he reported feeling overwhelmed and paralyzed in a bedroom, where he was sexually assaulted by multiple men, including Diddy.“Even though Plaintiff only consumed one alcoholic drink, the effects of the drink were immediate and overwhelming,” the suit claims.Diddy has been held at Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Detention Center since his arrest on September 16. He faces charges of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation for prostitution, with over 120 alleged victims, including ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura. Diddy has pleaded not guilty, and his trial is set for May 5, 2025.","The music mogul is facing new allegations related to his infamous “White Parties,” a Manhattan hotel, and a Macy’s stockroom.

President Biden: 'Honestly kind of shocking': GOP leader Anna Paulina Luna surprised by Biden's Hurricane response,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/honestly-kind-of-shocking-gop-leader-anna-paulina-luna-surprised-by-bidens-hurricane-response/articleshow/114228222.cms,"US President Joe Biden and GOP member Anna Paulina Luna

In a rare moment of working together across party lines, Anna Paulina Luna , a Republican from Florida and member of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, has praised US President Joe Biden for his response to recent natural disasters. Luna, whose district was hit hard by Hurricane Milton, said she was surprised to receive a call from the president last week, asking how she and her constituents were doing.""I did not expect that,"" Luna told Fox News Digital. ""I talked to him on the phone for about 10 minutes. The first thing he asked me was what I needed for my constituents, and we discussed the issues with FEMA .""Luna, a first-term congresswoman known for her strong criticism of the Biden administration, met with the president in person when he visited Florida to assess the storm damage. She described their discussion as ""extensive,"" focusing on disaster aid reforms and the response from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).Luna acknowledged the Biden administration and its efforts in handling the situation. ""I have obviously been very critical of President Biden in the past, but him stepping in and taking control to assist for the right reasons was honestly kind of shocking for me,"" she said.Their conversations covered Florida’s recovery and the aftermath of Hurricane Helene in Georgia and North Carolina. Luna advocated for changes to the National Flood Insurance Program and pushed for improvements in FEMA's response, particularly regarding debris clearance. She also criticised FEMA's $750 payment to disaster survivors as insufficient. ""Biden agreed and said it was a ‘bunch of malarkey,’ which is 100% true,"" Luna said.Despite her praise for the federal response, Luna remains committed to holding FEMA accountable, while joining a bipartisan group of lawmakers calling for an early emergency session of Congress to address disaster relief funding. However, Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has indicated that Congress will not reconvene until after Election Day.","Anna Paulina Luna, a Republican from Florida, has praised US President Joe Biden for his response to recent natural disasters.

Kamala Harris: JD Vance slams Kamala Harris for allegedly using Wikipedia to write her book,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jd-vance-slams-kamala-harris-for-allegedly-using-wikipedia-to-write-her-book/articleshow/114227900.cms,"US vice president Kamala Harris and senator JD Vance

US vice president Kamala Harris is facing allegations of plagiarism in her 2009 book 'Smart on Crime', according to a recent report by conservative writer Christopher Rufo . The claims suggest that Harris, who co-authored the book with Joan O’C. Hamilton, lifted multiple sections from uncited sources, including Wikipedia , press releases, and news reports.Adding to the argument, senator JD Vance posted on X, ""Hi, I'm JD Vance.I wrote my own book, unlike Kamala Harris, who copied hers from Wikipedia,"" further sparking discussion on social media.The accusations stem from a review conducted by Stefan Weber, a well-known Austrian expert on plagiarism. He identified more than a dozen instances of what he termed “vicious plagiarism fragments” in the book, with some instances involving minor paraphrasing issues, while others amounted to more serious infractions. These findings have drawn comparisons to other high-profile cases of plagiarism, such as that of Harvard University president Claudine Gay.In one example, Harris is accused of copying a passage about high school graduation rates almost copied from an NBC News report. Another section discussing the High Point crime-reduction strategy was allegedly lifted from a John Jay College of Criminal Justice press release. According to Rufo, the reproduction of material extends to Wikipedia, where Harris reportedly took long sections without attribution. These instances, he argues, raise concerns about the accuracy and integrity of her work.Though Harris may have used a ghostwriter, Rufo argues this doesn’t absolve her of responsibility, emphasising that by putting her name on the cover, she remains accountable for the content.","US vice president Kamala Harris is facing allegations of plagiarism in her 2009 book 'Smart on Crime', according to a recent report by conservative writer Christopher Rufo.

A man armed with guns and fake passes was arrested on Saturday outside Donald Trump 's Coachella rally site at the last minute, reports said citing the local sheriff. The suspect was caught about a mile from the rally venue with a phony-entry pass, according to police. He was also carrying a loaded shotgun, handgun and high capacity magazine. “We probably stopped another assassination attempt,” Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco said, as quoted by New York Post.The suspect has been identified as Vem Miller who was carrying a fake press card and entry pass.He is believed to be a member of a rightwing anti-government organization and was plotting to kill Trump, the Sheriff said. ""They were different enough to cause the deputies alarm,"" Bianco said.Miller is believed to be a member of a rightwing anti-government organization. A 49-year-old resident of Las Vegas, Miller was arrested at a checkpoint driving a black SUV. There have been two attempts on Trump's life and at the Coachella rally, Trump was speaking from behind the bulletproof glass.Miller is a registered Republican who holds a master’s degree from UCLA, and who ran for state assembly in Nevada in 2022, a report said.Bianco said Miller considers himself a so-called sovereign citizen, a group of people who do not believe they are subject to any government statutes unless they consent to them.He was released Saturday on $5,000 bail and is scheduled to appear at the Indio Larson Justice Center on Jan. 2, 2025, according to the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department inmate database.The Secret Service put out a brief statement saying it was aware of the arrest. “The incident did not impact protective operations. The Secret Service extends its gratitude to the deputies and local partners who assisted in safeguarding last night’s events,” the agency said.On July 13, Trump was shot at by Matthew Crooks in Butler, Pennsylvania. Crooks was killed by the Secret Service. In September, Ryan Wesley Routh was arrested for attempting to kill trump at a golf course.

Like Epstein's list, a list of names, all celebrities, with links to P Diddy and his Freak sessions, are doing the rounds on social media.The alleged list contains names of Leonardo Dicaprio , Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Ashton Kutcher, Paris Hilton, Howard Stern, Russell Brand, Mariah Carey, Jennifer Lopez, Russell Simmons, Usher, Meghan Fox. The list goes viral as Usher, Pink deleted their X posts and theories that Justin Bieber might have been a victim of Diddy float around.Nobody has been implicated in the Sean Combs case so far.P Diddy is facing serious charges of sex trafficking and racketeering where he forced women to have sex with male prostitutes that continued for days as the entire action was caught on camera. Huge stocks of baby oil, drugs were found at Diddy's sex den while Diddy did not plead guilty to the charges.Usher who once stayed with Diddy said his X account got hacked and that's why all his past posts disappeared. This happened as his old statement in which said he witnessed wild things when he stayed with Diddy resurfaced.Apart from Usher and Pink, Megan Fox deleted all her posts on Instagram and X triggering speculations over how she was linked to Diddy.An old snipped of Khloe Kardashian claiming that she attended one of Diddy's naked parties emerged. ""I got on a plane at 5:30 am. Well this party...I think half the people there were butt naked,"" this is exactly what Khloe said about Diddy's party.Diddy was Justin Bieber's mentor but Bieber's spokesperson said he is trying not to focus on the charges and accusation of Diddy. Justin is in a happy bubble since he became a father.As the list of the Hollywood A-listers becomes long, they are maintaining absolute silence over Diddy's arrest.An officer involved in the raid on Diddy's home compared him to Jeffrey Epstein, stating that Diddy was part of the same social circle as Epstein and Harvey Weinstein. The officer claimed there were 15 years of wild parties, suggesting that while not everyone who attended was complicit in trafficking, they witnessed inappropriate behavior. He emphasized that many people knew what went on, especially as things became more explicit late at night.Also read on the Diddy case:","No Hollywood A-lister has been implicated in the Sean Diddy trafficking case but several 'Diddy lists' are viral.

American icon Lilly Ledbetter , the activist who championed equal pay legislation in the US, has died at the age of 86. Her children reported that she passed away peacefully on Saturday, surrounded by family and loved ones, according to BBC.""Our mother lived an extraordinary life,"" the family said. Ledbetter’s activism led to the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Restoration Act, the first bill signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2009.This legislation made it easier for workers to sue for pay discrimination , sending a strong message that “there are no second-class citizens in our workplaces,” according to Obama.For nearly two decades, Ledbetter worked as a supervisor at Goodyear in Alabama before discovering that her male counterparts were earning more for the same role. The Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that she could not sue, as her complaint was not filed within six months of the discrimination. Her law ultimately overturned that ruling.In a heartfelt tribute on X, Obama remarked that Ledbetter “never set out to be a trailblazer or a household name. She just wanted to be paid the same as a man for her hard work.” Just last week, Ledbetter received the Future Is Female Lifetime Achievement Award from Advertising Week, and a film about her life, titled 'Lilly', starring Patricia Clarkson, premiered at the Hamptons International Film Festival.","Lilly Ledbetter's activism led to the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Restoration Act, the first bill signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2009.

At least six fresh lawsuits have been filed against Diddy revealing sensational details of what they faced at a Diddy party.

Diddy explained to him that it was a rite of passage to becoming a music star, at one point asking him: ""Don't you want to break into the business?"" The man said he complied out of fear, anxiety and power imbalance he felt with Combs, only realizing later that what had happened was sexual assault.The 54-year-old music mogul has pleaded not guilty to racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges alleging he coerced and abused women for years with help from a network of associates and employees while silencing victims through blackmail and violence, including kidnapping, arson and physical beatings.",At least six fresh lawsuits have been filed against Diddy revealing sensational details of what they faced at a Diddy party.

Li is likely to virtually inaugurate the CPEC-funded airport in the southwestern province, bordering Afghanistan and Iran.Neither side commented on the reason for a virtual inauguration, but sources cited heightened security concerns following the recent Karachi attack for Li being advised against travelling to a restive region.Islamabad, too, has sought to temporarily curb the movements of Chinese nationals in the country, citing fears of violence from armed groups. Officials said the Karachi blast is likely to figure in talks between Li and his Pakistani counterpart.“We will review progress on existing initiatives, especially the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ), and also explore new avenues of mutually beneficial cooperation.

KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA: At least 11 people have been killed and eight more have sustained injuries in a clash between two tribes in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Saturday, Al Jazeera reported.Tensions rose in the Kurram district of the province after two people were critically injured in a shooting incident between rival tribes in the northwestern part of the country.However, the reason for the clashes is not known.As the violence spread, vehicles were targeted in different areas of the district which led to many more casualties, as noted by senior official Javedullah Khan.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is known to be home to over 40 million people who come from various tribal groups and identities.Khan said the injured were taken to a hospital, and efforts were being made to secure travel routes and restore normalcy. The injured were taken to a hospital.Pir Haider Ali Shah, a former parliamentarian and member of a tribal council, said elders had arrived in Kurram to mediate a peace agreement between the tribes.""The recent firing incidents are regrettable and have hampered efforts for lasting peace,"" he said.Notably, tribal group meetings also known as 'Jirgas' are routinely held to ensure peace and stability in the region, as reported by Al Jazeera.In another incident last month, at least 25 people were killed in days of clashes between armed Shia and Sunni Muslims over a land dispute.Although both communities live together largely peacefully in the country, tensions have existed for decades between them in some areas, especially in Kurram, where Shia Muslims dominate in parts of the district, according to Al Jazeera.Clashes in the area have seen an uptick as last month alone over 20 people were killed between armed Shia and Sunni Muslims over a land dispute.Although both live together largely peacefully in the country, tensions have existed for decades between them in some areas, especially in Kurram, where Shia Muslims dominate in parts of the district, Al Jazeera noted.Meanwhile, on Saturday, the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for attacks at a coal mine in Balochistan which saw the death of over 20 individuals including Pakistani as well as Afghan nationals. The attack had involved the use of heavy weapons, rocket launchers and grenades.Such attacks have become common in Balochistan, the southern part of the country known to be home to key natural resources but whose benefits do not translate to uplifting the citizens' quality of life there.The outfits operating from Balochistan accuse the central government in Islamabad of exploiting the province's rich oil and mineral resources to the detriment of the local population in the country's largest and least-populated province, which borders Iran and Afghanistan.These groups have also expressed their anger against foreign nationals coming in for resource extraction but deriving profits without benefiting the locals. Attacks on international convoys have thus become a key way for citizens to register protests.BLA gave a higher casualty figure of 30 dead and 18 injured in the incident. It also said that Pakistani security personnel were disguised as workers, without giving evidence.It threatened more assaults unless the military withdrew from the province.Balochistan has been a hotbed of armed movements, with the BLA most prominent among them.Last week, the BLA - designated a ""terrorist group"" by Pakistan, the United Kingdom and the United States - claimed responsibility for an attack targeting Chinese nationals near Pakistan's largest airport, Al Jazeera reported.The Chinese embassy in Pakistan said at least two of its citizens were killed and a third injured after their convoy was targeted with an improvised explosive device believed to have been detonated by a suicide bomber.At least 10 people were injured in total, with four cars destroyed in the explosion and 10 more vehicles damaged in the resulting fire, local media reported.",Tensions rose in the Kurram district of the province after two people were critically injured in a shooting incident.

Pakistan is gearing up to secure its capital, Islamabad, ahead of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit. The event, taking place on Tuesday and Wednesday, will see the attendance of key regional leaders, including India's foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, Russia's Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and China's Premier Li Qiang.In preparation for the summit, Pakistan's government has implemented strict measures.These include strict enforcement against movements protesting ethnic nationalism and new laws that limit demonstrations in the capital. Authorities have also detained hundreds of supporters of opposition leader Imran Khan , who is currently jailed, following their attempt to march in Islamabad.Security concerns have been heightened by a recent attack on a convoy of Chinese engineers in Karachi, raising fears for the safety of foreign nationals amid ongoing separatist violence. The government has responded by authorizing troop deployments in the capital throughout the summit's duration.Imtiaz Gul, a security analyst, emphasized the importance of the summit for Pakistan, stating, ""The government claims to have made elaborate security arrangements and understandably so because it has to make sure that the event passes off peacefully without any untoward incident.""The SCO, which includes China, India, Russia, Pakistan, Iran, and six other member states, is viewed by some as an alternative to Western alliances such as NATO. The agenda for the Islamabad summit focuses on trade, humanitarian, and cultural issues, though domestic issues in Pakistan may loom large.The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, led by Imran Khan, has threatened protests during the summit. Ahsan Iqbal Chaudhary, Pakistan's minister for planning, accused the PTI of trying to disrupt the event, stating, ""The PTI doesn't want to showcase the positive side of Pakistan to the world.

ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan government on Saturday warned to use force if jailed former prime minister Imran Khan 's party went ahead to hold a protest in Islamabad on the occasion of Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit. The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf's (PTI) politic committee, comprising of its key members, decided to hold a protest at D-Chowk in the capital on Tuesday if the government failed to meet its demand to give the 72-year-old former cricketer-turned-politician access to his legal team and a physician, spokesman Zulfiqar Bukhari said.The authorities due to security concerns stopped all meetings with Khan, who has been incarcerated in Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail , after the protest by the party over the last weekend.Defence Minister Khawaja Asif warned that the government would use ""full force"" to stop the PTI's planned protest on the occasion of the SCO summit .""The call for protest on October 15 is an attack on the integrity of the country. We will not allow [anyone] to damage the honour and reputation of the country. The state will use all of its power and resources to prevent the invasion of Islamabad,"" said Asif while speaking to the media in Sialkot.The politician also called for the courts to intervene and take notice of the matter. ""Do the courts not see what the PTI founder is doing with the integrity of the country? The actions of the judiciary today will determine their role in history,"" he said.Separately, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal condemned the protest call by terming it "" political terrorism "" which is aimed at maligning the country. Addressing a press conference in Islamabad, he expressed disappointment at the timing of the protest.""Now there is no doubt that terrorism in Karachi and political terrorism protest calls are similar,"" the minister said, adding that both aimed to destabilise the country.Iqbal said the PTI was destroying the economy of the country and urged the party supporters to see the harm caused by their actions.""The PTI is attempting to undermine the government's economic recovery efforts. It's crucial to acknowledge the damage caused by these actions and consider the consequences of supporting policies that hinder Pakistan's growth and development,"" he said.The minister also stated that the country cannot afford destructive politics. ""Just because the PTI's leader is jailed, doesn't justify chaos,"" he said.Separately, federal minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit Baltistan Amir Muqam also strongly rejected the PTI's protest call. ""It is proof of anti-nationalism. There is no doubt that PTI's agenda seems to be anti-Pakistan because the party has declared the protest on this important occasion,"" he said.However, the PTI was in no mood to back off and Bukhari said the party was not against any foreign visit but ""this illegitimate government"" was trying to create a false case of normality when ""a former prime minister and leader of the largest party is illegally in prison (according to the UN) along with his wife"".""And to top it off, he has been banned to meet his legal team, doctor or family, which is against all human rights conventions and our constitution.

The mystery of Irvine , who vanished into clouds as mist swept over the Himalayan Summit, was finally solved after 100 years when the National Geographic team spotted a boot melting out of the ice on Mount Everest in September.Andrew ""Sandy"" Ivrine disappeared on Everest on June 8 1924 along with his partner George Mallory while attempting to become the first people to climb the world’s highest peak, the National Geographic said in a report.The team of National Geographic, in September, stumbled on a preserved boot, revealed by melting ice on a glacier. After examining the boot closely, they discovered a sock with ""a red label that has A.C. IRVINE stitched into it.""This discovery could provide further clues about the location of the team's personal effects and may help resolve the mystery of whether Irvine and Mallory ever reached the summit, nearly three decades before the first recognised summit by Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953.His partner Mallory’s remains were located in 1999, while the whereabouts of Irvine’s were unknown.“It's the first real evidence of where Sandy ended up,” National Geographic documentary director Jimmy Chin said. “A lot of theories have been put out there.” He hopes the discovery helps explain what happened on the mountain in 1924, and brings some closure to Irvine’s relatives who revere him still.“When someone disappears and there’s no evidence of what happened to them, it can be really challenging for families. And just having some definitive information of where Sandy might’ve ended up is certainly [helpful], and also a big clue for the climbing community as to what happened,” he added.Irvine's great-niece, Julie Summers, was moved to tears upon learning of the discovery, stating, ""It tells the whole story about what probably happened.""The Irvine family has offered to share DNA samples to confirm the identity of the remains. Irvine was only 22 years old when he went missing on June 8, 1924, during the final ascent to the summit with Mallory, according to National Geographic .Earlier this year, Mallory's final letter to his wife was digitized and published online by Cambridge University, revealing his doubts about their chances of reaching the summit.Irvine is believed to have been carrying a vest camera, the discovery of which could rewrite mountaineering history. Climb team member and National Geographic explorer Jimmy Chin did not disclose the exact location of the remains to discourage trophy hunters but “it certainly reduces the search area.”","Andrew ""Sandy"" Ivrine disappeared on Everest on June 8 1924 along with his partner George Mallory.
