Who is Maulana Mahmood Madani?





What is the controversy about?





Who agrees, who doesn't





NEW DELHI: Maulana Mahmood Madani has sparked fresh controversy with his remarks on the Supreme Court ’s handling of the Babri Masjid and triple talaq cases, as well as his comments on ‘ jihad ’ and ‘ghar wapsi’.His statements have sharply divided the political landscape, drawing criticism from the BJP and even differing views from within the Muslim community, including the All India Muslim Jamaat.Maulana Mahmood Madani is the current National President of the Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind (JUH), one of the country's oldest Muslim organisations.Born in 1964, he is the grandson of Maulana Syed Hussain Ahmad Madani, a leading theologian and an important figure in India’s freedom movement. His father, Maulana As’ad Madani, was a significant force in the JUH and served in the Rajya Sabha for nearly 17 years.After completing his studies in Islamic theology at Darul Uloom Deoband in 1992, Mahmood Madani began working with the JUH, eventually becoming its General Secretary in 2001 and later a Rajya Sabha MP from 2006 to 2012.He has organised anti-terrorism conferences, facilitated interfaith dialogue through numerous “Sadhbhavana Sansad” events, and overseen educational reforms within madrasas. His humanitarian work includes relief and rehabilitation efforts during riots, natural disasters, and international crises, according to a profile of him on Jamait's website.Madani, on Saturday, alleged that the apex court of the country was functioning under pressure from the BJP-led central government.He cited verdicts like Babri Masjid and triple talaq.""After the verdict into Babri Masjid, triple talaq and several other matters, it seems that courts are functioning under Government's pressure for a few years now...We have several instances before that have raised questions on the character of courts...Supreme Court is eligible to be called supreme only when it follows the Constitution and when it upholds the law. If it doesn't do that, it doesn't deserve to be called 'Supreme',"" he said.Moreover, he criticised the vilification of the term ""jihad"", citing the increased use of terms like ""love jihad, land jihad, 'Taleem' jihad, 'thook' jihad"". He said that the term was used in the Islamic Holy book of Quran ""in the sense of finishing off oppression and violence.""""Enemies of Islam and Muslims have made 'jihad' a synonym of abuse, conflict and violence. Terms like Love jihad, Land jihad, 'Taleem' Jihad, 'Thook' Jihad are used to insult the faith of Muslims. It is unfortunate that responsible people in goverment and media feel no shame in using such terms...In Islam, 'jihad' has been used in the Quran in several respects. It has been used in the sense of one's duties, and the welfare of society and humanity. When it has been used for war, it has been used in the sense of finishing off oppression and violence. Isliye jab jab zulm hoga tab tab jihad hoga,"" he said.He further took on the conversion law, saying that it was against the fundamental right to freedom of religion. Contrasting the same with ""ghar wapsi"", a term widely used to refer to a program of religious conversion to Hinduism, he said that those ""converting people into a particular religion have a free hand.""""Constitution of the country has provided us with Right to Freedom of Religion. But through the Conversion Law, this fundamental right is being finished off. This law is being used in a manner in which practising a religion becomes liable to fear and punishment. On the other hand, in the name of 'Ghar Wapasi', those converting people into a particular religion have a free hand. They are not questioned, and no legal action is taken against them,"" he said.All India Muslim Jamaat chief, Maulana Shahabuddin Razvi Barelvi, advised Madani to steer away from making comments on Supreme Court, Parliament and government as ""crores of Muslims trust"" these institutions.""Not just me, but crores of Muslims in India do not agree with his statement. Maulana Mahmood Madani is a religious man. He should speak from a religious point of view. He should not provoke or instigate Muslims. Crores of Muslims trust the Supreme Court, Parliament and Government,"" ANI quoted him saying.BJP MP Manoj Tiwari criticised his statements saying: ""If there is any place in the world where our brothers and sisters of the Muslim community are safest and facilitated, it is India.""Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) national spokesperson Vinod Bansal also condemned the statement saying: ""If a leader like Maulana Madani, who is considered ideal by the Muslim community, calls all Muslims 'jihadi', calls all Muslims a community which is a victim of atrocities and calls upon all Muslims to do 'jihad', who calls all non-Muslims 'murda' - I would like to ask him (Madani) if all freedom fighters and army jawans are 'murda kaum'. He has questioned the Supreme Court, too. He has said that the Supreme Court should be supreme and should also do supreme work. Will he give them a certificate for the same? This is the height of 'jihad'.""Bihar governor Arif Mohammad Khan, however, agreed with the 'jihad' statement saying: ""As long as oppression exists, jihad will exist. It is very difficult for me to disagree with that. Oppression or injustice—according to the Quranic idea—does not mean only the oppression you face. If any weak or poor person is being oppressed, it becomes your responsibility to raise your voice for them and help them. If there is oppression, then it is necessary to speak out against it, and that is what is called jihad. .. Madani's public statement about 'jihad' contradicts what is in texts followed in an institution he's associated with.""","Maulana Mahmood Madani is the current National President of the Jamiat Ulama-i- Hind. He is the grandson of Maulana Syed Hussain Ahmad Madani, a leading theologian and an important figure in India’s freedom movement. His humanitarian work includes relief and rehabilitation efforts during riots, natural disasters, and international crises.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125667891,imgsize-792781,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

NEW DELHI/BHOPAL: Maulana Mahmood Madani, head of Jamiat-Ulama-Hind, Saturday accused Supreme Court and govt of undermining minority rights and said that recent court verdicts, including those in the Babri Masjid and triple talaq cases, suggested that the judiciary was functioning ""under govt pressure"".""Supreme Court is entitled to be called 'supreme' only as long as it upholds the Constitution and the rights enshrined in law; otherwise, it loses moral legitimacy,"" Madani said, drawing a sharp response from the BJP which accused him of making inflammatory remarks and pushing the country towards division.Madani, who was addressing a meeting of the national governing body of the influential body of Deobandi critics, also justified the concept of Jihad as a ""noble duty"" aimed at ""eliminating injustice, protecting humanity and establishing peace"" and asserted that ""wherever oppression takes place, there will be jihad"".Alleging that ""anti-Islam forces"" have distorted the concept of jihad, turning it into a term synonymous with violence, to malign Muslims, he said armed struggle is sanctioned only to prevent oppression and disorder and that ""jihad is not an individual or private undertaking. Only a legitimate and organised state authority can determine it under Islamic jurisprudence.""He added, ""India, being a democratic and secular nation, is not an Islamic state; hence any debate about physical jihad here has no relevance.Muslims are constitutionally bound citizens, and govt is responsible for protecting the rights of all.""Madani also reiterated Muslims' opposition to the singing of national song Vande Mataram.BJP's response was swift and furious. ""'Whenever there is oppression, jihad will be waged' is an extremely inappropriate remark as terror and violence have been inflicted not only on India but across the world in the name of jihad,"" said party spokesperson Sambit Patra.""His statement that Supreme Court has no right to call itself supreme is extremely unfortunate and completely unacceptable,"" the BJP spokesperson further said, adding the apex court can take suo motu cognizance of his comments.On Madani's stand against Vande Mataram, Patra said that such a mindset hurts the country's unity and constitutional values. ""He should remember that Vande Mataram is not a symbol of any religion but the fragrance of India's soil and the voice of its soul. In the 150th year of Vande Mataram, Madani's provocative comments expose his divisive agenda.""Govt has celebrated the anniversary of Vande Mataram with several events, with there being talk that it may seek a discussion on India's national song in the upcoming session of Parliament.Madani's remarks come close on the heels of his uncle Arshad, head of the rival faction of the Deobandi outfit, alleging that Muslims were being persecuted. Speaking in the immediate aftermath of the Red Fort blast and the arrest of the promoter of Al-Falah University, which has been under spotlight after the arrests of its doctors and employees in connection with the attack, Madani senior said Muslim institutions were facing persecution.","Maulana Mahmood Madani, head of Jamiat-Ulama-Hind, accused Supreme Court and govt of undermining minority rights.

BJP slams Mahmood Madani

NEW DELHI: Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind president Maulana Mahmood Madani on Saturday said the term “jihad” is being deliberately misused to malign the Muslim community, stressing that it actually means a “struggle against oppression. ”He alleged that “enemies of Islam” are responsible for distorting the term.“Enemies of Islam and Muslims have turned the word ‘jihad’ into a synonym for abuse, conflict and violence. Phrases like ‘love jihad,’ ‘land jihad,’ ‘taleem (education) jihad’ and ‘thook (spit) jihad’ are used to insult the faith of Muslims. Sadly, even responsible people in the government and the media use such terms without shame,” he remarked.“In Islam, ‘jihad’ appears in the Quran in several contexts — as a call to one’s duties, to the welfare of society and humanity, and, when referring to war, as a struggle to end oppression and violence.(whenever there is oppression, there will be jihad),” the cleric added.Madani further alleged that the minorities' constitutional rights are being “undermined” and they are being “targeted.”Citing the Babri Masjid verdict and the criminalisation of triple talaq, he argued that the Supreme Court can be considered “supreme” only when it upholds the Constitution and the law.“After the judgments on Babri Masjid, triple talaq and several other matters, it appears that courts have been functioning under government pressure for the past few years… We have earlier instances too that raise questions about the courts’ character. The Supreme Court deserves to be called ‘Supreme’ only when it follows the Constitution and upholds the law. If it doesn’t, it doesn’t merit that title,” Madani remarked.The Jamiat chief also flagged bulldozer actions, mob lynching, and the takeover of Waqf properties, arguing that these developments have left Muslims feeling “unsafe.”Mentioining on the national song Vande Mataram, Madani contended that communities that surrender under pressure are “murda qaum (lifeless people),” while those that stay firm and confront challenges are “zinda qaum (living people).”“‘Murda qaum’ do not engage with difficulties — they surrender. They will be asked to recite Vande Mataram and they will comply immediately. That is the sign of a ‘murda qaum’. A ‘zinda qaum,’ however, must lift its morale and face situations head-on,” he observed.Hitting out at Madani, the BJP accused him of attempting to ""vitiate"" communal harmony.“He is a completely political person. I heard his speech. He was describing ‘jihad’ in an Islamic context… but he contradicted himself and said, ‘agar hum pe zulm hoga, toh jihad hoga’ (there will be jihad if we are oppressed). Who is he threatening — the Government of India?” Delhi BJP spokesperson Yaser Jilani told news agency ANI.Jilani warned Madani against issuing “threats.”“Don’t threaten like this. The Government of India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi think for everyone. Mahmood Madani is trying to vitiate harmony,” he stated.","Jamaat Ulama-i-Hind president Maulana Mahmood Madani said the term ‘jihad’ is being deliberately misused to malign the Muslim community.

NEW DELHI: The Mahagathbandhan on Saturday unanimously elected Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav as the opposition coalition’s leader in the Bihar assembly, a decision taken at the alliance's first meeting since its drubbing in the recent state polls.The meeting was convened by Yadav ahead of the five-day assembly session beginning Monday.RJD MLA Bhai Virendra told reporters, “Tejashwi Yadav has been elected leader of the Mahagathbandhan in the state legislature. Naturally, he will also lead our party in the assembly.”Congress MLC Samir Kumar Singh, a working president of the grand old party’s state unit, noted that the choice was unanimous. “We have sufficient numbers, and he (Tejashwi) will also be the Leader of the Opposition,” he remarked.The Mahagathbandhan was routed in the elections, with the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) retaining power with 202 seats. The RJD-led alliance, which had won 110 seats against the NDA’s 125 in 2020, managed just 35 seats this time — 25 of them from the RJD.Singh added that members of both Houses voiced “concern” over how the elections were conducted. “These were anything but free and fair. The SIR, first carried out in Bihar, remains questionable. It’s no surprise there’s so much political friction in a state like West Bengal,” he observed.He further noted that the alliance would “continue to raise its voice inside the House on issues concerning the people and confront the BJP-led coalition if it backtracks on promises made during the elections.”",Tejashwi Yadav is the opposition coalition's leader in the Bihar assembly.

Demolition of journalist’s home sparks political storm in Jammu,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/demolition-of-journalists-home-sparks-political-storm-in-jammu/articleshow/125663392.cms,"JAMMU/SRINAGAR: Demolition of journalist Arafaz Ahmad Daing’s home in Jammu by Jammu Development Authority (JDA) has triggered a political confrontation, with deputy CM Surinder Choudhary demanding to know who ordered the action and urging LG Manoj Sinha to order an inquiry.Choudhary visited Saturday the demolished structure at Narwal and said neither the elected govt nor CM Omar Abdullah ordered the step. “The JDA vice chairman is posted by the LG, and police involved also report to the LG. If this action did not happen on your orders, then order an inquiry and suspend the officials responsible,” he told reporters.The house was levelled Thursday morning by JDA teams accompanied by a large police contingent. Daing said his father built the structure 40 years ago and the family had lived there ever since. His counsel, lawyer Sheikh Shakeel Ahmad, alleged the demolition was “selective targeting” executed by JDA vice chairman with support from district authorities.Former J&K BJP president Ravinder Raina visited the site Friday and expressed solidarity with the family. He said he spoke to Sinha and claimed the latter told him “the LG administration did not use bulldozers.So where did this action come from? I don’t want to politicise this”.Choudhary accused Raina of lying. “Ask him to show his call records and prove he actually spoke to the LG,” he said. He praised neighbour Kuldeep Sharma, who offered land to Daing’s family, calling it “a powerful example of the brotherhood that defines J&K”.Omar accused Raj Bhavan–posted officers of carrying out “selective demolitions” to allegedly undermine the elected govt. “Development authorities, revenue officials — these should be our officers. Instead, officers are being posted without consulting us, and they take dictation from somewhere, use bulldozers,” he alleged.Choudhary said Omar “never supported actions driven by revenge”. “If officials acted on their own without consulting the LG or the CM, they should be placed under suspension,” he said, adding J&K govt backs moves to retrieve encroached land but insisted action “must not be selective” and should begin with “influential land grabbers, not the poor”.",Demolition of journalist Arafaz Ahmad Daing’s home in Jammu by Jammu Development Authority (JDA) has triggered a political confrontation.

SRINAGAR: Leh Apex Body (LAB) urged Saturday a judicial probe panel to obtain medico-legal case (MLC) reports of all civilians injured in alleged firing by security forces on Sept 24 during protests in Leh for Sixth Schedule status and statehood.LAB spearheaded the protests as the largest political and religious group in the Union territory of Ladakh. It made the demands in a representation to the probe commission headed by retired Supreme Court judge BS Chauhan, a day after the panel extended the deadline for such submissions and evidence to Dec 8.LAB member and climate activist Sonam Wangchuk is among the over 70 people arrested over the violence that left four people dead and over 80 injured. He has been charged under the stringent National Security Act (NSA).In its submission, LAB urged the commission to accord post-mortems reports of deceased civilians the highest importance in its inquiry.“All CCTV full footage recorded by Ladakh Police on Sep 24 between 10:00am and 6:30pm must be collected, preserved, analysed and thoroughly examined by the commission. In particular, footage from a 360-degree CCTV camera installed slightly outside NDS Memorial Park (near the site of the violence) must be retrieved and scrupulously scrutinised,” states the representation submitted by LAB convenor Gelek Phunchok and coordinator Tsering Stanzin.LAB has expressed skepticism over some cops being wheeled into hospital several days later. “Approximately 20 police personnel were brought to SNM Hospital several days after Sept 24, claiming injuries. The timing, intention and motive behind presenting these personnel for medical examination long after the incident must be thoroughly investigated to rule out any attempt to fabricate or exaggerate counter-claims of injury,” LAB said.Complete and accurate counts of bullets and ammunition, including pellets and tear-gas shells, fired by police and CRPF personnel that day must be ascertained from official records and made public before the inquiry commission, LAB said.LAB has stressed that its points are “integral and non-negotiable components of fair and credible inquiry”. “Any omission or oversight in these matters would seriously undermine public faith in the judicial system.”Union home ministry (MHA) had announced the commission after demands from LAB and Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA), another key Ladakh organisation.

Women in polygamous marriages: Study reveals what Muslim women experience when husbands bring in more wives

NEW DELHI: The Assam Assembly on Tuesday passed “The Assam Prohibition of Polygamy Bill, 2025,” aiming to ban polygamous marriages across the state and impose strict penalties on those who enter into or conceal a second marriage while the first is still valid.The law, introduced by Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on the first day of the winter session, will apply statewide except in Sixth Schedule areas and to members of Scheduled Tribes as defined under the Constitution.Speaking before the state assembly approved the bill, Sarma said the legislation, which bans polygamous marriages across most of Assam, is not against Islam. He said the legislation was “irrespective of religion and not against Islam as being perceived by a section”, reported PTI.""Islam can't promote polygamy. If this bill passes, then you will get a chance to be a true Muslim. This bill is not against Islam. The true Islamic people will welcome this Act. Countries like Turkey have also banned Polygamy; there is an arbitration council in Pakistan..."" Sarma said, as cited by ANI.Sarma has also pledged to implement the Uniform Civil Code in Assam if he is re-elected in next year’s assembly polls.""If I return to the assembly as the Chief Minister, I will bring the UCC in the first session of the assembly. I give you my commitment that I will bring the UCC to Assam,"" Sarma added.The bill was introduced amid the absence of opposition MLAs from Congress, CPI(M), and Raijor Dal, who staged a walkout following a discussion on the death of singer Zubeen Garg.The bill defines polygamy as marrying another person while either party already has a valid, existing marriage or a living spouse from whom they are not legally divorced or whose marriage has not been annulled.It states that anyone entering into a polygamous marriage will face up to seven years in prison and a fine, as specified in law.""No person shall marry, if, he has a living spouse or he is not legally separated from the other spouse following due procedure of law, after marriage, or he is a party to a marriage which is not yet dissolved or annulled by a decree of divorce and either has right to appeal or the specified time for appeal has not been expired or is in appeal, or the appeal has been presented but has not yet been dismissed,"" the bill mentions, as cited by ANI.""Whoever abets any offences punishable under this Act or attempts to commit any such offence shall be punishable with the punishment as provided under the Act for the offence of polygamy. Whoever, during the lifetime of his or her spouse or during subsistence of a valid marriage or without having been lawfully divorced from the spouse, or without having been declared the marriage null and void or dissolved, contracts a marriage contravening any of the provisions contained in the Act under Section 4 shall be guilty of an offence punishable with imprisonment upto 7 years and a fine,"" the bill adds.","Assam Assembly passes 'Prohibition of Polygamy Bill, 2025' Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma says the legislation is not against Islam.

But I would like to say that we will resolve such issues,” Kharge said.“People in the high command — Rahul Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi and I — will sit together and deliberate on this… We will give the medicine when required,” he added.This was the first acknowledgment by Kharge that there is indeed a power struggle between Siddaramaiah and his deputy DK Shivakumar in Karnataka.As soon as the Congress government in Karnataka completed its halfway mark on November 20, reports quoting Congress sources suggested that MLAs and MLCs from Shivakumar’s faction had camped in Delhi to push the party high command to make him the next chief minister.DK Shivakumar added to the speculations after he claimed that there had indeed been “a confidential understanding on leadership transition among five-six leaders” soon after Congress won a landslide in the 2023 elections.The deputy chief minister made the first reference to the power pact but stopped short of divulging more details. “This is confidential.

JAIPUR: A Class 4 student at a Jaipur school, who died by suicide weeks ago, had reportedly faced bullying in her classroom for over 18 months, including verbal abuse from classmates, while the school failed to maintain a safe and healthy environment, according to a CBSE enquiry report.Following the findings, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) issued a show-cause notice to Neerja Modi School in Jaipur. The notice comes after a CBSE-formed enquiry panel investigated the tragic death of the 9-year-old girl, who reportedly jumped off the school building earlier this month.ACP Mansarover Aditya Kakade said that an investigation in the case is underway. ""The case is being investigated. No arrest has been made so far,"" he said.The enquiry committee highlighted multiple lapses by the school, noting the persistent bullying the girl endured. It stated that her parents had initially reported the issue to teachers in July 2024. The panel further observed that the class teacher failed to respond to the child’s distress, despite the girl approaching the teacher five times in the last 45 minutes of her life.""As per the statements of the parents given to the committee, it is clear that the school did not take any preventive and proactive action on the repeated complaints of bullying and teasing by the classmates. The class teacher and the school management were very well aware of the harassment and the trauma being faced by the deceased child,"" the board noted in the show-cause.The board further said that the conversation and communications made by the parents to the class teacher and the school management went unheard, and accused the school of not taking any action or having any compliance and provisions for a grievance redressal mechanism in such circumstances.Citing the enquiry committee report, the board said, "" it seems something unusual happened in class and she is looking extremely disturbed. A few hot discussions among students are also observed, and it may be related to the use of bad words and some derogatory comments, as per parents' observation and video footage"".The class teacher, in her written statement, admitted that the deceased student informed her about her classmate using ""bad words"" for her, but the other student denied the allegations. However, other children had complained to the teacher earlier about the constant usage of ""bad words"" in the classroom between students, the show-cause read.The board also noted that the school's committee and policy mechanism were entirely ""non-responsive""According to the report, the parents of the deceased reported the bullying to the teachers and coordinators more than three times over the 1.5 years, yet the anti-bullying committee never contacted the parents or intervened.In September 2025, the father witnessed a boy bullying the girl during a PTM and complained to the class teacher, who allegedly advised that the child ""should adjust,"" the report says.""The school failed to maintain a healthy atmosphere and lacked specific measures to tackle bullying,"" the report states, adding that these were clear violations of CBSE guidelines, Supreme Court directives and NCPCR safety norms.The Class 4 girl tragically ended her life by jumping from the school’s fourth floor on November 1. Given the gravity of the incident, a two-member CBSE committee visited the school the following day and also met with the girl’s parents.The committee’s findings reveal a troubling pattern of harassment and neglect on that day. The girl arrived at school in a cheerful mood, but after 11 am, she became visibly upset following interactions with classmates involving a digital slate, on which some boys wrote or displayed content that embarrassed and distressed her.CCTV footage reviewed by the committee shows the girl repeatedly asking the boys to stop and erase the content. It also confirms that she approached the class teacher five times in the final 45 minutes of her life, seeking assistance, the report states.The report pulled up the teacher for failing to act on the child's distress, ""even when she approached her five times in the final 45 minutes of her life. The teacher's admitted negligence and reported aggressive response (""shouting"") directly contravenes the requirement for staff to ensure a safe, supportive environment and to act as protective caregivers,"" it said.Beyond the bullying complaints, the committee identified several safety and infrastructure lapses. These include inadequate CCTV monitoring, failure to flag the child's unsupervised movement across multiple floors and the absence of floor attendants at the time of the incident.The stairway from which the child fell had railings described as ""easily scalable and unprotected,"" and the building allegedly had more floors than permissible under school safety guidelines, the report noted.The report also pointed out violations of CBSE regulations, including the mandate to store CCTV footage for 15 days, non-compliance with child protection guidelines, and the school’s failure to offer psychological support despite clear signs of the child’s distress.Several parents gathered at Shaheed Smarak Saturday to protest and demand action against Neerja Modi School, where 9-year-old Amaira Kumar fell to her death from the fourth floor on Nov 1. They alleged that incidents of bullying at the school were ""not isolated, but rampant"".","The Central Board of Secondary Education issued a show-cause notice to Neerja Modi School in Jaipur. The notice comes after a CBSE-formed enquiry panel investigated the tragic death of the 9-year-old girl. The enquiry committee highlighted multiple lapses by the school, noting the persistent bullying the girl endured.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125499118,imgsize-22574,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/the-class-teacher-in-her-written-statement-admitted-that-the-deceased-student-informed-her-about-her-classmate-using-quotbad-wordsquot-for-her-but-the-other-student-denied-the-allegations.jpg"

ED Cracks Down On ‘White-Collar Terror Module’, Conducts 25 Raids Linked To Al-Falah University

FARIDABAD: The investigation into the Nov 10 Delhi terror attack and the white coat terror module involving doctors has led sleuths to two more hideouts linked to Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie, the Al-Falah University professor who was making explosives that were to be used as IEDs in cars.Ganaie, according to investigators, had hid 2,600kg ammonium nitrate at a shed in a field behind a mosque adjoining the Al-Falah University campus for 12 days before shifting it to a cleric's house in Fatehpur Taga, from where it was eventually seized just a day before the Delhi blast.Muzammil had also rented a three-room house in Khori Jamalpur, around 8km from Al-Falah University, in July. This property, which is above a plastic raw materials unit owned by the village's former sarpanch Jumma, was leased for Rs 8,000 a month.Muzammil told the owner he needed the property to start a fruit supply business and intended to bring stocks from Kashmir for local sale. He frequently visited the house, according to investigators, often accompanied by Dr Shahin Shaheed, another Al-Falah doctor linked to the terror module and now in custody of National Investigation Agency (NIA).Although Muzammil introduced her as a family member to the sarpanch, he has confessed to NIA that Shahin is his wife.He vacated the property after three months.Police had earlier found two premises rented by Ganaie in which he kept ammonium nitrate, the larger haul at the cleric's house and a 350kg tranche in a smaller room in Dhauj. Ganaie had also procured a grinder and a portable furnace to process the ammonium nitrate and used it to build explosives. He kept this equipment at the house of a local cab driver he knew.Jumma told investigators that he first encountered Muzammil while seeking treatment for his cancer-stricken nephew at Al-Falah Hospital, where he also met Dr Umar Un Nabi, the Delhi bomber who was in the i20 that blew up outside Red Fort metro station on Nov 10, killing 15 people. Umar was a professor of medicine at Al-Falah.The shed where the ammonium nitrate was initially parked is owned by a local who Muzammil met at the mosque. Muzammil convinced him to allow him to store the sacks at the shed, not telling him what they contained, just items he needed to arrange some space for. It was only when the resident expressed concern about theft that Muzammil shifted the entire stock, along with other materials, to the house of cleric Mohd Istaq in Fatehpur Taga. A joint team of Faridabad police and J&K Police recovered the ammonium nitrate from the cleric's premises on Nov 9.NIA sleuths took Muzammil to Khori Jamalpur, where former sarpanch Jumma identified him. Investigators spent several hours at the location, quizzing the family about Muzammil's visits, his companions and activities inside the rented premises.Investigators said the chemical used in the Delhi blast was sourced from NIT Nehru Ground. NIA conducted a raid on Thursday at BR Scientific and Chemicals, a shop situated in NIT Nehru Ground, Faridabad. Sources indicated that the shop is owned by Lal Babu, a licensed chemical dealer. This store supplies chemicals to laboratories in various hospitals, as well as to colleges and universities. During questioning, Dr. Muzammil disclosed that he had purchased the chemical from this shop. NIA scrutinised the store's records and confiscated several documents for further investigation.","Investigators uncovered two more hideouts linked to Al-Falah University professor Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie, who was making IEDs.

The ex-boyfriend of National Guard member Sarah Beckstrom has said she felt her deployment to Washington DC was “pointless,” just days before she was fatally shot by an Afghan national.In an interview with CNN, Adam Carr described how his 20-year-old girlfriend grew frustrated with the restrictions placed on her and other Guardsmen. “It was mixed,” Carr said. “She got deputized in there, and they gave them no rights to do anything.”Carr said Beckstrom often told him about some really bad confrontations with residents. “People spit towards us, cuss at us, throw things at us, and we can’t do nothing,” he recalled and said. “She couldn’t detain nobody. She couldn’t stop them from doing wrong. It was—they told them to call the cops.”Despite her frustration, Beckstrom believed in the mission to combat crime in the city. “She wanted to make the difference. She wanted to extremely. She was happy with it. And she just was also like, ‘Why am I here if I can’t do nothing? Where they limited them so much.’ She’s like, ‘It’s pointless.’ She’s like, ‘I get why we’re here.Crime is bad, but it’s pointless if we can’t do anything.’”Beckstrom and fellow National Guard member Andrew Wolfe were shot near White House on Thanksgiving Eve. Beckstrom died the following night with her parents at her side, while Wolfe remains in critical condition. A 29-year-old Afghan immigrant, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, has been arrested in connection with the shootings.President Donald Trump announced Beckstrom’s death and called her a “highly respected, young, magnificent person” and was “outstanding in every way.”US Attorney General Pam Bondi noted that Beckstrom, who started service in June 2023, had volunteered for the DC deployment over the Thanksgiving period.","National Guard member Sarah Beckstrom was fatally shot by an Afghan national on Thanksgiving Eve.

BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia hospitalised; condition 'extremely critical',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bnp-chairperson-khaleda-zia-hospitalised-condition-extremely-critical/articleshow/125650030.cms,".





Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chairperson and former prime minister Khaleda Zia is in “extremely critical” condition, a close aide said on Friday, as she continues treatment in hospital. The 80-year-old leader was admitted on Sunday night after developing a chest infection that affected both her heart and lungs.“Last night, the doctors said that her physical condition is extremely critical,” BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir said on Friday, as quoted by PTI, citing the state-run BSS news agency.Following Friday prayers, the BNP organized special prayer gatherings across the country for her recovery. “We have sought prayers from the people across the country after Jummah prayers for the recovery of the ‘Mother of Democracy’, Begum Khaleda Zia. We pray that she may recover and return to the people to get the opportunity to work for the country,” Fakhrul added.Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus expressed deep concern over Zia’s condition and urged everyone to pray for her early recovery. His office said Yunus has been regularly inquiring about updates on her health and has instructed officials to ensure every form of necessary medical support.“There must not be any shortcomings in Begum Khaleda Zia's treatment. The government is prepared to provide all necessary support,” Yunus said. “At this crucial moment of democratic transition, Begum Khaleda Zia is a profound source of inspiration for the nation. Her good health is extremely important for the country.”Zia has long suffered from multiple health complications, including liver and kidney issues, diabetes, arthritis, and eye-related illnesses. She is the widow of slain president Zia-ur Rahman. Her elder son, Tarique Rahman, has been living in London since 2008, while her younger son, Arafat Rahman, died of a cardiac arrest in 2025.With national elections approaching next year, Zia’s health is seen as particularly significant for the party. The BNP has emerged as a key player in Bangladesh’s changing political landscape after a student-led protest toppled Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League government on August 5, 2024.Earlier this year, Zia returned to Bangladesh from London on May 6 after spending four months abroad for advanced medical treatment.","The 80-year-old leader was admitted on Sunday night after developing a chest infection that affected both her heart and lungs.

US Attorney ‘Gently Pushes’ FBI’s Kash Patel, BLASTS Reporter Over Trump’s National Guard Deployment





US president Donald Trump on Thursday claimed that it was “not allowed” to use the word ""Indian"" anymore.Speaking to a reporter, he said: “You’re not allowed to use the word ‘Indian’ anymore. The only ones that want you to do it are the Indians. I will never tell you to change.”The word “Indian” is used to describe Native American communities. While some tribal members continue to use the term, others argue it is outdated or rooted in racism.The term ""Indian"" stems from Christopher Columbus's error in believing he had reached India, leading to its historical application to Native Americans.Trump has a long and uneasy history with Native American tribes. He often positions himself as their defender, despite long-running disputes with them.In April this year, organisations condemned Trump's threat to block a new stadium in Washington, DC, unless the local NFL team returned to its old name, the Redskins. The name was dropped in 2020 after years of complaints that it was a racial slur.“I may put a restriction on them that if they don’t change the name back to the original ‘Washington Redskins,’ and get rid of the ridiculous moniker, ‘Washington Commanders,’ I won’t make a deal for them to build a Stadium in Washington.The team would be much more valuable, and the deal would be more exciting for everyone,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.Trump also put the pressure on the Cleveland Guardians to change their name back to the “Indians,” claiming that the “Indian people” want the Guardians to be the “Indians” yet again.Several native groups rejected his claim. The Association on American Indian Affairs said such mascots reduce indigenous people to caricatures and ignore their living cultures. ""These mascots and names do not honor native people; they reduce us to caricatures. Our diverse people and cultures are not relics of the past or mascots for entertainment,"" the Association on American Indian Affairs said in a statement, as quoted by Reuters.While some groups oppose the Commanders returning to the former name, the Native American Guardians Association said, ""The Native American Guardians Association stands with the president of the United States in the call to return common sense and sanity back to our nation.""In 1993, Trump testified before Congress against Native American gaming. During that hearing, he said some tribes “don’t look like Indians to me,” and questioned their identity and their role in running casinos. He later added that he might have “more Indian blood than a lot of the so-called Indians” operating reservations, as quoted by Time.","US president claims it is 'not allowed' to use the word 'Indian' anymore.

Hong Kong high-rise fire





Hong Kong political activist Finn Lau posted a long analysis on social media after a massive fire killed 128, pushing back against officials who blamed the disaster on bamboo scaffolding that was used in the tall buildings. Lau said that bamboo is fire-resistant and has been used safely for decades, so he believes it could not be the main cause. Instead, he accused authorities of using bamboo as a convenient excuse to avoid answering tougher questions about safety rules, inspections, and emergency planning.In his post, Lau said that government departments were too slow to respond and had ignored earlier warnings about overcrowded construction sites and poor fire-prevention measures. He also criticised officials for shifting responsibility instead of explaining why safety standards were not enforced and why the blaze spread so quickly in a modern city like Hong Kong. According to Lau, the real issue was long-term government negligence, not bamboo materials.He blamed the mesh netting, saying its highly flammable nature had been overlooked, and accused the government of pushing metal scaffolding before completing a proper investigation.He claimed that the government ignored earlier reports and whistleblower complaints about the widespread use of non-compliant, flammable mesh nets on Hong Kong construction sites over the past year.A devastating fire ripped through a high-rise residential block, Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po in Hong Kong, earlier this week, enveloping multiple floors in thick smoke. Firefighters raced to the scene, evacuating hundreds of residents as flames spread rapidly across the building’s exterior. The blaze burned for several hours before crews finally brought it under control. Several people have been treated for smoke inhalation, and emergency services continue to check for other potential casualties. The disaster killed hundreds with many more still missing.Authorities said the fire began on construction scaffolding wrapped in protective netting and foam-like panels during renovation. Fire alarms reportedly failed and many residents had to alert neighbours manually.",Hong Kong political activist Finn Lau posted a long analysis on social media after a massive fire killed 128.

Arrest of Rahmanullah Lakanwal in DC shooting





A second Afghan national brought to the United States under Operation Allies Welcome was arrested on Saturday, only days after a separate case of a shooting in Washington DC.This latest arrest involves a man accused of posting a TikTok video that appeared to show him constructing a bomb and naming the Fort Worth area in Texas as his target, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).According to Fox News, Mohammad Dawood Alokozay was taken into custody. Court records show he has been charged at the state level with making a terroristic threat.DHS confirmed that Alokozay entered the country through Operation Allies Welcome, the Biden-era resettlement effort launched after the US military withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, when the Taliban took over. Alokozay was admitted on September 7, 2022, as a lawful permanent resident. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has now issued a detainer following his arrest.Texas authorities worked with the FBI in a Joint Terrorism Task Force and detained Alokozay on Tuesday.His arrest came only one day before a separate shooting in Washington DC involving another Afghan named Rahmanullah Lakanwal.Lakanwal is accused of shooting two National Guard soldiers near the White House, in which one died, and one remains in critical condition.Lakanwal also arrived in the US under Operation Allies Welcome. He lived in Washington state and, according to a Trump administration official, applied for asylum in December last year and received approval in April. Investigators said he had no known criminal history before the attack.Later, CIA Director John Ratcliffe confirmed that the Lakanwal had previously worked “with the US Government, including CIA, as a member of a partner force in Kandahar.”These back-to-back incidents have raised questions about the Operation Allies Welcome.A report from the DHS Inspector General last year found serious data errors in the Biden-era programme, saying some arrivals were issued multiple identification numbers or had names recorded incorrectly. The review warned that such problems made it harder to track “biographic or criminal history data” and said DHS did not have a clear system to monitor when parole for evacuees expired.In the aftermath of the DC shooting, President Trump said his administration would “re-examine” all Afghans who entered the country during Biden’s presidency. The MAGA chief said the attack exposed “lax migration policies” and announced a sweeping freeze on immigration: all immigration requests from Afghan nationals have been suspended indefinitely. The US has also paused issuing visas to individuals travelling on Afghan passports.The POTUS also ordered a sweeping pause on immigration from “Third World countries,” a category that includes several nations in Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. This aligns with his hardline stance on foreigners, supported by his MAGA base.Earlier this month, Trump also signalled a softening stance on H1-B visas.",Mohammad Dawood Alokozay was arrested in Texas on Tuesday.

US secretary of state Marco Rubio made it clear that the United States’ visa policy does not automatically entitle a student to a visa.Speaking in detail to Ben Shapiro, Rubio said, “No one. It’s not a constitutional right. It’s not guaranteed by law. Every day, consular officers deny visas for all kinds of reasons, suspicion of overstaying, criminal associations, whatever it may be. Visas are denied worldwide daily. No one is entitled to one.”Rubio explained that there is a common misconception that applicants are automatically allowed entry unless a reason to deny the visa is found. “That’s not true. The burden of proof is the other way around,” he said.Rubio weighed in on national security concerns, saying, if a student visa applicant openly supports terrorist organisations like Hamas, or anything that goes against the principles of American policies, they would likely be denied entry. “We probably wouldn’t let them in — and we shouldn’t,” Rubio added. He clarified that if such support becomes evident after someone has already entered the US, the visa should still be revoked, even though it may take extra formalities.“If we later discover information that would have led to denial in the first place, that’s grounds for revocation,” he said.Rubio focused on Trump's 'America First' stance in his brief explanation. “It’s not in the national interest, or our foreign policy or national security interest, to bring people onto our campuses who aren’t just studying but are also promoting or excusing terrorist organisations committed to violence and destruction.”The secretary concluded and reaffirmed that the government’s authority is supreme: “So we have the right to deny visas before entry and revoke them after entry if someone’s presence undermines our national security or interests. That’s exactly what we intend to do.”His comments come as US President Donald Trump took a softer stance on H1-B visas. In a Fox News interview earlier this month, the MAGA chief said that the United States lacks talent and needs foreign skilled workers from abroad to fill critical roles such as tech and defence. The conservative Republican base grew angry and accused Trump of betraying the GOP’s hardline immigration principles.","US secretary of state Marco Rubio made it clear that the United States’ visa policy does not automatically entitle a student to a visa.

Malaysia custody deaths: Over 300 migrants died since 2020; raids intensify on illegal immigrants,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/malaysia-custody-deaths-over-300-migrants-died-since-2020-raids-intensify-on-illegal-immigrants/articleshow/125668158.cms,"Representative image (AI-generated)

Raids intensify as ‘Year of Enforcement’ declared

Families seek accountability





More than 300 migrants without legal status have died while in Malaysian custody since 2020, sparking renewed concern among rights advocates over detention conditions and treatment of vulnerable groups fleeing violence and persecution.One of the latest cases is that of Ben Za Min, a 32-year-old from Myanmar’s Chin state, who died in late September after being detained during an immigration raid in northern Malaysia.He had fled Myanmar following the military coup nearly five years ago and was working in construction while awaiting a decision on his refugee status, according to New York Times.According to his family, a minor cut on his lower right leg became infected and turned septic. He was first taken to a hospital for treatment and then returned to detention before being admitted again shortly before his death.His sister, Lin, said she believes he was not given proper medical care. ""I think they dismissed him as someone without documentation and treated him with no respect,"" she said.Malaysia’s home affairs ministry has not responded to questions regarding his death or the broader death toll inside detention centres.Malaysia has tightened immigration controls this year as authorities face a rise in illegal entries. The government has labelled 2025 as “the year of enforcement”, and officials have increased raids in workplaces and migrant communities.Home minister Saifuddin Nasution Ismail said in May that the government “will not compromise” in tackling illegal immigration. Arrests have risen to about 7,000 migrants per month, more than double in recent years, according to Fortify Rights.Malaysia does not offer political asylum, but undocumented migrants can live and work if recognised as refugees by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). However, activists say even some registered refugees have been detained. UNHCR has over 211,000 refugees recorded in the country, most from Myanmar.Concerns over overcrowding, medical neglect and prolonged detentionRights groups warn that detainees are being held for long periods in overcrowded facilities with poor sanitation, limited food and insufficient medical attention.“Detainees face severe torture, both physical and psychological,” said Yap Lay Sheng of Fortify Rights. “Many are held for prolonged periods in overcrowded facilities with filthy sanitation, poor ventilation, inadequate access to clean water, food and medical care.”Many detainees are Rohingya Muslims, who escaped what the United States and others have recognised as genocide by Myanmar’s military. Stateless and unable to return home, they are often detained indefinitely.Malaysia’s immigration department denies allegations of mistreatment and overcrowding, saying its 20 detention centres operate at roughly 90 per cent capacity. It said that some of the detainees remained in custody due to a lack of travel documents or refusal of their home countries to accept them back.Since 2019, UNHCR has been restricted from visiting most detention centres, limiting its ability to identify refugees or inspect conditions. The department says access is possible through an application process, highlighting two visits last year.Advocates argue that Malaysia’s policies are endangering people fleeing violence, including military defectors and civilians escaping civil war in Myanmar, where conflict has entered its fifth year.“It's a very inhumane policy to lock up people who should be getting refugee status,” said Ramachelvam Manimuthu, president of Malaysia’s National Human Rights Society. “There are heartbreaking stories: people who are sick in detention centers, people who have died in detention centers.”For families like Ben Za Min’s, answers remain scarce. His relatives in Myanmar said that they still do not know when or how his injury occurred. A hospital reported that he died of septic shock.","More than 300 migrants without legal status have died while in Malaysian custody since 2020.

Pakistan: Can Imran Khan meet visitors in jail? What rules say on 'political prisoner' access,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-can-imran-khan-meet-visitors-in-jail-what-rules-say-on-political-prisoner-access/articleshow/125668106.cms,"Former Pakistan PM Imran Khan (ANI file photo)

What the rules say about ‘political prisoner’ access



This raises a critical question: what does the jail manual actually say?

Meetings with five people per week, including lawyers and relatives

30 minutes of phone time weekly

Rules that are ‘subjective’



Family’s repeated requests denied







Former Pakistan prime minister and World Cup–winning captain Imran Khan has been in jail for over two years. In recent days, rumours about his health, and even claims that he may have died, have spread widely on social media. His family says they are worried because they have not been allowed to meet him for weeks.The anxiety deepened on Friday when Imran Khan’s son Kasim Khan publicly demanded that the government prove the 73-year-old PTI founder is alive.""We demand proof of Imran Khan's life,"" Kasim said in a social media post.For nearly a month, no family member, lawyer or party aide has been allowed to see the former cricketer-turned-politician, fuelling speculation that he may have been harmed inside Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail, where he has been incarcerated for over two years.According to Dawn, while the government maintains that Imran Khan is being given all ""possible facilities"", a senior cabinet member on Friday claimed that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi was trying to meet Khan in violation of the jail manual.Information minister Atta Tarar’s remarks triggered a sharp response from the PTI, which insists its court-approved visiting schedule — Tuesdays and Thursdays — is not being honoured.Dawn reports that visitation and phone calls are tied to a prisoner’s ""good behaviour"", giving the jail superintendent wide discretion.As the newspaper notes: ""Visitation, phone calls allowed to prisoners are linked to their ‘good behaviour’, meaning the jail superintendent has the discretion to allow or disallow meetings.""Current and former prison officials told Dawn that prisoners in Punjab, including political detainees, are allowed:Even condemned prisoners can meet family and lawyers once a week and get the same phone allowance via public call offices inside Adiala Jail.Political prisoners, Dawn adds, are placed in special cells under strict security, with daily medical check-ups mandated to ensure they are healthy.But these rules are not absolute. Their implementation depends heavily on the inmate’s behaviour, making the process ""necessarily subjective"", according to Dawn.Serious charges -- including terrorism or anti-state activities -- can also restrict access.A retired senior prison department officer told Dawn that access to lawyers or relatives ultimately rests with the jail superintendent, who can block meetings or calls if an inmate’s behaviour is deemed ""not good"".Despite court orders and repeated attempts, Imran Khan’s three sisters, PTI members and CM Sohail Afridi have been camping outside Adiala Jail for days, demanding a meeting with him.Kasim Khan said the family has been kept completely in the dark: ""My father has been under arrest for 845 days. For the past six weeks, he has been kept in solitary confinement in a death cell with zero transparency. His sisters have been denied every visit, even with clear court orders allowing access. There have been no phone calls, no meetings and no proof of life. Me and my brother have had no contact with our father.""Calling the situation ""deliberate"", he added: ""This absolute blackout is not a security protocol. Rather it is a deliberate attempt to hide my father's condition and prevent our family from knowing whether he is safe… the Pakistani government and its handlers will be held fully accountable legally, morally and internationally for my father’s safety.""He also appealed to international organisations and human rights groups to intervene urgently.""We demand proof of his life, enforce court ordered access, end this inhumane isolation and call for the release of Pakistan’s most popular political leader who is being held solely for political reasons,"" Kasim said.","Former Pakistan PM Imran Khan has been in jail for over two years.

At least 20 people died, and several remain missing after a boat capsized on Lake Maï-Ndombe in northwestern Congo, according to local residents. The vessel, traveling from the town of Kiri to the capital, Kinshasa, included a newly ordained Catholic deacon, the local Diocese said in a statement on Friday.The boat capsized between the villages of Bobeni and Lobeke around 8 pm on Thursday night, Emmanuel Bola, a resident of the nearby town of Inongo, told AP.The Congolese government has not released an official death toll. Kevani Nkoso, governor of Maï-Ndombe province, said, “We are awaiting details from the teams deployed to the field to determine the number of people killed and the number of survivors.”Boat capsizing incidents are becoming increasingly frequent in Congo as more people rely on wooden vessels instead of the few available roads. Many of these boats are overloaded with passengers and goods, rarely equipped with life jackets, and often travel at night, making rescue efforts difficult and leaving many bodies unaccounted for.Earlier this month, another capsizing left 64 people missing. In September, at least 193 people died in two separate boat accidents in northwestern Congo, which state media attributed to “improper loading and night navigation.”","A boat capsizes on Lake Maï-Ndombe in northwestern Congo, killing at least 20 people.

A group of of young women and girls abducted in Nigeria's northeastern Borno state on November 22 were freed late Saturday.Their release comes amid a surge in abductions of young people across the country over the past two weeks.""All 12 were released,"" Abubakar Mazhinyi, president of the local Askira-Uba council, told the AFP news agency.The Nigeria Army said ""the rescued girls have been evacuated to a secure military facility where they are receiving comprehensive medical care, psychological support and debriefing. Upon completion of these processes, they will be formally reunited with their families.""Last Saturday, 13 women and girls aged 16 to 23 were abducted near farms close to an area that has become a jihadist hideout.The Army said Boko Haram/Islamic State West Africa Province ISWAP was behind the abduction.The gang freed one of them after she told them she was nursing a baby.Borno state is at the center of Nigeria's conflict with the jihadists, which started 16 years ago with Boko Haram Although the jihadist movement has lost momentum, Boko Haram and its rival, the breakaway Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), continue to pose a threat in the region.The recent kidnapping is a harsh reminder of the 2014 abduction of nearly 300 girls in Chibok.Elsewhere in the country, armed gangs seized more than 300 children from a Catholic school in the central-western Niger delta state last week.Although some managed to escape, more than 265 children and teachers are still in captivity. These abductions were claimed by local gangs rather than jihadists.On Wednesday, President Bola Tinubu declared a security emergency, ordering mass recruitment of police and army personnel.He gave the Department of State Services approval to deploy trained forest guards and recruit more staff to flush out armed groups hiding in forests.""There will be no more hiding places for agents of evil,"" Tinubu said in a televised address.","A group of of young women and girls abducted in Nigeria's northeastern Borno state on November 22 were freed late Saturday.

Trump Snaps At Female Reporter, Screams STUPID For Question On DC Gunman | ‘Afghan Went Nuts’

What the 'media offenders' page looks like

Trump administration escalates fight with media outlets

Trump widens hostilities against female reporters





The White House launched a new page on its website on Friday called ""media offenders,"" listing news sites, reporters, and stories it claims misled the public.The top publications cited as ""media offenders of the week"" were the Boston Globe, CBS News, and the Independent. Reporters from those outlets were singled out for stories about a controversial video released last week by six Democratic lawmakers.The lawmakers, all of whom are military veterans or former intelligence officials, reminded service members they are not obligated to follow illegal orders.In a video posted online last week, the lawmakers said, ""Right now, the threats to our Constitution aren't just coming from abroad, but from right here at home.""""Our laws are clear: You can refuse illegal order. ... You must refuse illegal orders. No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our Constitution,"" they added.US President Donald Trump called the lawmakers' actions ""seditious"" and ""treason.""The page included an ""offender hall of shame"" with a list of stories the White House considers mistruths.Each story is explained and categorized under labels such as ""lie,"" ""omission of context,"" or ""left-wing lunacy.""The White House described the site as ""a record of the media’s false and misleading stories flagged by The White House.""The page also features a leaderboard of news sites the administration claims reported stories incorrectly.The Washington Post tops the list, followed by MSNBC (recently rebranded as MS NOW), CBS News, CNN, The New York Times, Politico, and The Wall Street Journal.There's also a section with ""repeat offenders"" with outlets that the Trump administration objects to.All outlets on the leaderboard, along with others, turned in their Pentagon press badges last month after rejecting new rules imposed by the Department of Defense.The rules would leave journalists vulnerable to expulsion if they reported information, classified or otherwise, that had not been approved by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth for release.Trump has also been involved in court battles against The New York Times, CBS News, ABC News, The Wall Street Journal, and the Associated Press over the past year.The administration's broader conflict with media outlets has also taken a personal turn. In recent weeks, Trump has faced criticism for insulting female reporters.This week, the president called a female reporter from The Times ""ugly"" after she co-wrote a data-driven report about the president showing signs of aging.The president, who is 79, drew fire two weeks ago after telling a Bloomberg reporter to be ""quiet, piggy"" when she tried to ask a follow-up question about disgraced financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's emails.","The Washington Post tops the list, followed by CBS News, CNN, The New York Times, Politico, and The Wall Street Journal.

US President Donald Trump on Sunday justified his stance on a permanent pause on migration from all “third-world countries” by citing Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).“Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate,” said in a post on his social media platform Truth Social.Section 212(f) authorises the president to suspend entry of “any aliens or of any class of aliens” if their admission is deemed detrimental to US national interests.Trump has doubled down and remains firm in his stand, despite appeals from multiple United Nations (UN) agencies, including its human rights office, urging the US administration to continue allowing asylum seekers. His previous posts on X also warned of measures including denaturalisation of migrants who “undermine domestic tranquility,” ending federal benefits for non-citizens, and deporting foreign nationals considered a “public charge, security risk, or non-compatible with Western Civilization.The White House and Department of Homeland Security have not clarified how these measures will be implemented.The administration has already taken concrete steps consistent with the freeze. USCIS Director Joseph Edlow confirmed that asylum officers have been instructed to halt issuing decisions until “enhanced vetting can be completed for every applicant,” citing public safety as the top priority. The US State Department, led by secretary Marco Rubio, simultaneously paused visa issuance for all travellers holding Afghan passports, describing the move as a security measure. “The United States has no higher priority than protecting our nation and our people,” Rubio said.The new restrictions follow a Wednesday shooting near the White House in which two National Guard soldiers were critically injured. Spec Sarah Beckstrom, 20, later died of her injuries, while Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, remains hospitalised, 'fighting for life' as Trump said.The alleged shooter, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national, is expected to face first-degree murder charges, with additional counts likely, according to Jeanine Pirro, US attorney for Washington, DC.According to the Washington Post, the pause also affects all decisions on asylum claims, including those filed by migrants seeking protection from persecution based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group. At the end of 2024, USCIS had over 1.4 million pending affirmative asylum claims, and the suspension is expected to exacerbate delays.",US President Donald Trump justified his stance on a permanent pause on migration from all “third-world countries” by citing Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) The new restrictions follow a Wednesday shooting near the White House in which two National Guard soldiers were critically injured.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125667796,imgsize-628058,width-400,resizemode-4/image-2025-11-30t075704.jpg"

Karoline's Family HIT By ICE Arrests; ‘Illegals, Can’t Let…’: Huge Embarrassment For Trump’s Secy





Several protesters were arrested in Lower Manhattan on Saturday after a confrontation outside a government parking garage, where they were protesting possible Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity, the New York Police Department said.The incident unfolded outside a facility on Centre and Hester Streets, on the edge of Chinatown where dozens of federal agents appeared to be gathering for a potential immigration raid nearby, according to police and witnesses. The situation quickly escalated as crowds grew, The New York Times reported.According to ABC News, demonstrators were seen blocking vehicles and shouting “ICE out of New York,” including at one point preventing a van from leaving the garage. The NYPD said officers observed protesters blocking the street and issued multiple orders to disperse; when they did not comply, officers made arrests. The force confirmed that “multiple” people were taken into custody but did not immediately specify the number or list charges.NYPD said in a statement that officers “observed multiple people blocking the street and were told multiple times to disperse but they did not comply.”The New York Times reported that the confrontation began shortly after 11 am, when protesters formed a physical barricade at the garage entrance and piled bags of rubbish beside them as federal agents from U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Department of Homeland Security arrived. By early afternoon, nearly 200 demonstrators had gathered, chanting at agents who looked on from inside.Police arrived to separate the groups and install metal barricades, but tensions heightened shortly after 1.15 pm, when federal vehicles attempted to leave the garage. Protesters chased the vehicles down Canal Street, with some throwing planters and rubbish bins. A masked agent was seen spraying something from a vehicle window, the NY Times reported. NYPD officers and protesters continued to clash on the street as the federal convoy drove off.The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests from either outlet for comment on whether an operation had been planned.Saturday’s clash came a month after a large federal enforcement action in the same area, during which nine people were arrested. ABC News reported that four U.S. citizens detained during that earlier operation were held for nearly 24 hours without federal charges, according to local congressman Dan Goldman. The renewed activity comes amid expectations of intensified immigration enforcement under US President Donald Trump and growing concern among New York officials about future raids.","Several protesters were arrested in Lower Manhattan on Saturday after a confrontation outside a government parking garage.

Celebrated Alabama Teacher CAUGHT Assaulting Her Child On Video, Fired As Police Move In | WATCH





Jason Hudson, a 48-year-old man from Deatsville, Alabama, was sentenced to 965 years in prison on November 19, 2025, after an Autauga County jury convicted him in October of 84 counts related to child sex crimes. The charges included first-degree rape, sodomy, incest, sexual abuse of a child under 12, and producing and possessing child pornography.Authorities launched the probe after Hudson downloaded tagged child sex abuse material on information-sharing platforms, triggering alerts to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC). The Autauga County Sheriff's Office uncovered thousands of images and videos depicting male and female children, some under age 2, enduring sexual abuse and torture with whips, fire, and rope. Further searches revealed home videos Hudson made of himself raping, sodomizing, and sexually abusing a child under 12.Sentences were imposed consecutively by 19th Judicial Circuit Presiding Judge Amanda Baxley: 90 years each for rape, sodomy, incest, and five production counts; 20 years for sexual abuse; and 10 years (3 to serve) each for 75 possession counts.In court, the victim branded Hudson a ""monster"" in their impact statement, stating they had ""achieved more than they thought was possible"" and that Hudson ""no longer has a hold on their life.""Hudson's wife, Farren Jill Hudson, 37, pleaded guilty in July 2025 to first-degree sodomy against a child under 12 and received 30 years in prison.District Attorney C.J. Robinson hailed the victim as a ""truly brave survivor"" who confronted her abuser without hesitation. He lamented the unavailability of the death penalty, calling the case unforgettable and among the most disturbing evidence he had encountered.The investigation involved the Autauga County Sheriff's Office, Alabama Law Enforcement Agency, Butterfly Bridge Children's Advocacy Center, and the district attorney's office","Jason Hudson, a 48-year-old man from Deatsville, Alabama, was sentenced to 965 years in prison on November 19, 2025.

Sean “Diddy” Combs organised a Thanksgiving meal for roughly 1,000 inmates at FCI Fort Dix, where he is currently serving a 50-month sentence. According to TMZ, Combs worked with an internal inmate group called Bankroll Bosses to buy food from the commissary, prepare it over two days and distribute it to every housing unit inside the New Jersey facility.Combs said the aim was to ensure people had something to eat during the holiday period. “Thanksgiving, to me, is about making sure other people eat,” he said, adding that inmates often struggle with being away from their families during the holidays. Due to the lack of kitchen equipment in the prison, those involved in the preparation used improvised tools, including ID cards for cutting.According to B.I., a former gang leader who helped coordinate the effort, the group prepared enough food for about 200 inmates per building. The prison itself provided a standard Thanksgiving meal, but Combs and the group opted to supplement it with additional food items purchased internally.Speaking about life inside the facility, Combs said there was a sense of support among inmates. “There’s a lot of misinterpretations about prison. There is a strong brotherhood. We all look out for each other,” he said, describing the Thanksgiving effort as “a little bit of home in a dark place.”Combs has been at FCI Fort Dix since 30 October, serving his sentence for violating the Mann Act.","Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs organised a Thanksgiving meal for roughly 1,000 inmates at FCI Fort Dix, where he is currently serving a 50-month sentence.

"Turkeys pardoned, Democrats roasted: How Trump turned Thanksgiving into political spectacle",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/turkeys-pardoned-democrats-roasted-how-trump-turned-thanksgiving-into-political-spectacle/articleshow/125659023.cms,"President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump, stand next to national Thanksgiving turkey Gobble during a pardoning ceremony

(By arrangement with The American Bazaar)





Donald the merciful was in a forgive, but not forget mood as he bestowed “unconditional” pardons on Gobble and Waddle, two pampered Thanksgiving turkeys, at the traditional White House ritual as he roasted his foes.But some turkeys cannot be pardoned as all birds are not created equal, he suggested launching a seemingly endless harangue against birds of Democratic feather before getting down to the business at hand.When he first saw the birds he thought they should be named Chuck and Nancy — after Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi — POTUS revealed, but “I would never pardon those people” not caring for First Lady Melania’s plea to be nice.Claiming that last year’s turkey pardons issued by “sleepy Joe Biden ,” were invalid because he used an autopen, he asked, “Where’s Hunter?” suggesting his predecessor’s son could once again be in legal trouble.He even joked about sending the retired turkeys to an infamous prison in El Salvador that has been used to house migrants deported from the United States.Trump chose Black Friday to strike again to cancel “all Executive Orders, and anything else that was not directly signed by Crooked Joe Biden.”“Any document signed by Sleepy Joe Biden with the Autopen, which was approximately 92% of them, is hereby terminated, and of no further force or effect,” he declared on his Truth Social mouthpiece.“The Radical Left Lunatics circling Biden around the beautiful Resolute Desk in the Oval Office,” he alleged, “took the Presidency away from him,” by signing his name using an autopen – a device commonly used by US presidents, including Trump in the past.“Joe Biden was not involved in the Autopen process and, if he says he was, he will be brought up on charges of perjury,” he warned. But it wasn’t clear how Trump would actually nullify Biden’s pardons and executive orders.Earlier at the roast, Trump didn’t mention two other turkeys he would never pardon — former FBI director James Comey and New York attorney general Letitia James — as a federal judge tossed cases against them saying the prosecuting attorney was illegally appointed.The Justice Department is bound to appeal and try again to charge Comey and James, who had claimed the prosecutions were politically motivated, pointing to Trump’s public demands to punish his enemies.Despite facing judicial obstacles, Trump “has other options for pursuing and penalizing those he perceives to have crossed or undermined him,” noted the New York Times suggesting he was flexing full executive power against his foes.Meanwhile, Trump scored a major victory as a judge in Georgia dismissed the last pending criminal prosecution against the president, effectively ending efforts to hold him criminally responsible for attempts to overturn the 2020 election.Trump has now seen three criminal cases against him dissolve since he was re-elected last year. The Georgia case was seen as one of the most serious legal threats to Trump, because state criminal convictions are not subject to presidential pardons.Trump was quick to go to town over the dismissal of “this Illegal, Unconstitutional, and unAmerican Hoax… at the direction of Crooked Joe Biden and his ‘Handlers,’ in their obsession with doing anything and everything to ‘GET TRUMP.’”Even as he accused “The Deranged Democrats” of having “weaponized our Law Enforcement and Justice System against HONEST AND LOVING Americans,” his FBI summoned a group of Democratic lawmakers whom Trump had branded ‘traitors’ for calling on troops to disobey unlawful orders.Among other turkeys not deserving Trump’s pardon were “The Creeps at the Failing New York Times,” who had found “signs of fatigue in Trump's trademark stamina” suggesting that at 79, he was starting the day later and holding fewer events.Accusing “the Radical Left Lunatics in the soon to fold New York Times” for doing “a hit piece on me that I am perhaps losing my Energy, despite facts that show the exact opposite,” he branded the venerated old lady of New York a “cheap RAG” and “truly an “ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE.”“The writer of the story, Katie Rogers, who is assigned to write only bad things about me, is a third rate reporter who is ugly, both inside and out,” he wrote insulting a female reporter for the third time in recent weeks.Later he furiously called yet another female reporter a “stupid person” after being asked about an Afghan man suspected of shooting two national guard troops near the White House.Pointing out that the Afghan shooter, who had worked with a CIA-backed military unit in Afghanistan, was granted asylum by the Trump administration in April 2025 after “thorough vetting,” she asked, “So why do you blame the Biden administration?”“Because they let them in,” Trump snapped. “Are you stupid? Are you a stupid person? Because they came in on a plane, along with thousands of other people that shouldn’t be here, and you’re just asking questions, because you’re a stupid person.”Dismissing the whole episode as “FAKE NEWS,” the White House’s official RapidResponse 47 X account proudly posted the exchange on social media.Earlier this month, Trump lashed out at a Bloomberg reporter who asked him about the Epstein files, responding with “quiet, quiet, piggy” while pointing his finger at her.Meanwhile, using the shooting in Washington, Trump ordered reexamination of all green cards issued to people from 19 countries “of concern” listed in a June presidential proclamation.“I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover,” Trump thundered on Truth Social saying “Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation.”Trump also “retruthed” without context several posts from his followers depicting him as a warrior against the “Deep State” with one showing him as a king in full body armor with an ominous warning: “NONE shall escape his justice!” - Thanksgiving or no thanksgiving!","President Donald Trump pardoned Gobble and Waddle, two pampered Thanksgiving turkeys, at the traditional White House ritual as he roasted his foes.

Trump ORDERS Military Action Against Venezuela; U.S. Forces Close In As Maduro Vows Resistance





US President Donald Trump has declared that the airspace above and around Venezuela is “closed in its entirety,” amid escalating tensions between Washington and Caracas.""To all Airlines, Pilots, Drug Dealers, and Human Traffickers, please consider THE AIRSPACE ABOVE AND SURROUNDING VENEZUELA TO BE CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY,"" Trump said through a post on Truth Social.Trump had said earlier this week that the United States is preparing new measures against alleged drug-trafficking networks in Venezuela, telling service members during a Thanksgiving call that operations involving ground strikes would begin “very soon.”“In recent weeks, you’ve been working to deter Venezuelan drug traffickers, of which there are many. Of course, there aren’t too many coming in by sea anymore,” Trump said, as cited by CNN.Trump added that fewer shipments were coming in by sea and said the US would soon move to block trafficking routes on land as well, calling those operations “easier” and set to begin “very soon.” He warned alleged traffickers to “stop sending poison” into the United States.Earlier this week, Trump also designated Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his close associates as part of a foreign terrorist organization.The move labels the so-called “Cartel de los Soles”, a term experts say refers more to allegedly corrupt officials than to a structured criminal group, as a foreign terrorist entity, giving Trump expanded authority to impose new sanctions on Maduro’s assets and infrastructure, as cited by CNN.The United States has deployed more than a dozen warships and 15,000 troops to the region under what the Pentagon calls “Operation Southern Spear.” As part of this anti–drug trafficking campaign, US forces have carried out boat strikes that have resulted in more than 80 deaths.Last week, the US aviation regulator cautioned major airlines about a “potentially hazardous situation” when flying over Venezuela, citing a deteriorating security landscape and increased military activity in the area.In response, Venezuela revoked operating rights for six major international airlines that had halted flights after the FAA issued its warning.","US President Donald Trump has declared that the airspace above and around Venezuela is “closed in its entirety,” amid escalating tensions between Washington and Caracas.

Former Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan 's son Kasim Khan on Thursday claimed his father has been kept in a ""death cell with zero transparency"", despite Islamabad refuting rumours that the cricketer-turned-politician was “brutally” assaulted by police for seeking a meeting with their brother last week.Kasim Khan said there have been ""no phone calls, no meetings and no proof of life. Me and my brother have had no contact with our father.""He alleged that the former prime minister, who has been under arrest for 845 days, has been kept in solitary confinement for the past six weeks. He also said that Khan’s sisters have been denied permission to visit him despite court orders allowing access.Kasim further alleged that the Shehbaz Sharif-led government and “its handlers” will be held accountable “legally, morally and internationally”.He also urged the international community to “intervene urgently” and demand proof of life.Earlier, Imran Khan’s sister, Noreen Niazi, accused Pakistani authorities of keeping the former prime minister in harsh prison conditions and cutting off all family contact, claiming that “no one knows what’s happening inside the jail.”Speaking to ANI about her last meeting with the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder, she said, “...Heis going through a tough time alone. He is in isolation... As per the jail manual, one can't be placed in isolation for more than 4 days. But he was put in isolation for three weeks last year as well, during which electricity was switched off, and he wasn't even allowed to read books. The same has been done now.”Her allegations come against the backdrop of growing speculation about Khan’s health and the month-long blackout on family and legal visits. “We don't know anything. They are not telling us anything, nor are they letting anybody meet him,” she said, adding that even PTI members with approved meetings were prevented from entering.“We have not been allowed to meet him for the last four weeks... The Police have been ordered to stop us and, I believe, also given permission to do to us whatever they want. This has never happened in Pakistan before,” she said.Niazi described the treatment of supporters and family members outside Adiala Jail as unprecedented. “No one has ever disrespected women like this, nor has anyone been oppressed this way. This is the first time in Pakistan that these people have been allowed to beat up people like there won't be any consequences, without considering if it's a child, an elderly person, or a woman in front of them. The world is aware of what's happening in Pakistan. ”She called the current situation Pakistan’s “darkest period”, comparing it to “Hitler-era-like repression”, and alleged that people are being “killed, beaten, and jailed without accountability”. She argued that the continued ban on meeting Khan was intentional. “We have been going there for the last four weeks, and they are not letting us meet him. This is why such rumours are spreading.”Warning of growing frustration, she said public anger is nearing a tipping point. “I believe there will be a spark among people soon, and then they will see the level to which the people go... The oppression is too much.”Expressing no expectations from the global community, she said: ""... We have such support from outside that Trump called our dictator Asim Munir a very good friend of his... Shehbaz Sharif had lost his seat. Asim Munir helped him win, so he is the bigger force... Dictators have come before. Their fates were not good either. But how long can these people survive, or how long can they continue to oppress?""Meanwhile, adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah and senior Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leaders on Thursday rejected rumours about former prime minister Imran Khan’s deteriorating health, saying the PTI founder was “fine and nothing is wrong with him,” reported Pakistan daily Dawn News.Earlier in the day, the PTI pressed for a meeting with the jailed leader, expressing concern over his condition after he was denied access to his family and lawyers for more than three weeks. Imran has been in prison since August 2023, serving a 14-year sentence in a corruption case.His family members and party activists have been staging protests outside Adiala Jail in recent days, demanding he be allowed visitors. A PTI delegation once again attempted to meet him on Thursday, but authorities refused permission.The UN's deputy spokesperson reaffirmed that the world body has urged Pakistani authorities to ensure the human rights and due-process rights of Imran Khan are respected.This follows his arrest and ongoing legal proceedings -- the UN has emphasized that in such politically sensitive cases, fair treatment under law and procedural fairness are essential.In a response to ANI, United Nations deputy spokesperson Farhan Haq said, ""We have called for his human rights and due process rights to be respected.""","Pakistan Erupts As Imran Khan’s Son Claims ‘No Proof Of Life’ Amid CM Afridi's Jail-Side Protest.'Darkest period' in Pakistan, says sister Noreen Niazi.

As Pakistan Halts Afghan Transit, Kabul Boosts India Partnership And Fast-Tracks The Chabahar Route





The UAE has stopped issuing visas to Pakistani nationals and only narrowly held back from imposing a complete ban on the Pakistani passport, a senior Pakistani interior ministry official told a parliamentary panel on Thursday.Pakistan’s additional interior secretary Salman Chaudhry informed the Senate Functional Committee on Human Rights that both the UAE and Saudi Arabia had “stopped short of imposing a ban on the Pakistani passport,” as reported by Dawn.“If a ban is imposed, getting it removed would be difficult,” Chaudhry said.Senator Samina Mumtaz Zehri, who chairs the Senate human rights committee, confirmed the interior ministry official’s account in comments to the paper.She said the travel restrictions stemmed from concerns about individuals visiting the UAE and “getting involved in criminal activities”.According to her, the committee was informed that the UAE had largely stopped issuing visas to Pakistani nationals, and that only a limited number had been granted recently, and “after much difficulty”.A Pakistani blue passport is an official travel document reserved for government officials and other eligible personnel, distinguishing it from the standard green passport issued to ordinary citizens.Meanwhile, UAE Ambassador to Pakistan Salem M Salem Al Bawab Al Zaabi briefed Pakistan's finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Thursday about “major UAE visa facilitation reforms for Pakistanis,” according to a statement from the minister’s office.The statement added that nearly 500 visas were being processed daily at the newly launched UAE Visa Centre in Pakistan, outlining the reforms highlighted by the envoy.Pakistan and the UAE maintain longstanding diplomatic, economic, and cultural ties. The Gulf nation is among Pakistan’s largest trading partners in the region and a key source of remittances, supported by a sizeable Pakistani workforce residing there.However, Pakistani nationals experienced a surge in visa rejections in early July, prompting interior minister Mohsin Naqvi to take up the matter with his UAE counterpart.","The UAE has stopped issuing visas to Pakistani nationals, a senior Pakistani interior ministry official told a parliamentary panel on Thursday.
