Nagaland moves SC to prosecute 30 Armymen,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nagaland-moves-sc-to-prosecute-30-armymen/articleshow/111767845.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday admitted a writ petition by Nagaland govt challenging the Centre’s one-and-a-half-year-old order denying sanction for prosecution of 30 Armymen who were named in the FIR lodged by state police for killing 13 civilians in a botched-up operation to ambush militants in Mon district on Dec 4, 2021.Moving the petition, filed under Article 32 of the Constitution invoking violation of the fundamental rights of citizens, before a bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra , state advocate general K N Balgopal said though state police has clinching evidence against the Armymen, including a Major, the Centre has arbitrarily refused to accord sanction for their prosecution.“The competent authority in the Union government has, without application of mind and going through the entire material collected by the special investigation team (of state police) during the course of investigation, arbitrarily and against public interest refused sanction to prosecute the accused Armymen,” Nagaland govt said.The bench issued notices to the Centre and the ministry of defence and sought their responses within four weeks.In July 2022, the SC had stayed prosecution of the armed force personnel belonging to Alpha team of 21 Para (Special Forces) on petitions from the wives of the accused as they claimed that their husbands were being prosecuted without the state obtaining mandatory sanction for prosecution from the Centre. They had also sought quashing of the FIRs . The Centre on Feb 28 last year refused to sanction prosecution of these personnel.The state said the Army ambush team had opened fire on a Bolero pickup vehicle carrying coal miners without challenging or asking them to identify themselves. It cited the claim of the ambush team that they had positively identified those killed as they were carrying a gun and weapons, wearing dark clothes and had quickly jumped into the vehicle.“The above factors are common among villagers in Nagaland. The Army surveillance team had no basic knowledge about ground realities in Nagaland, where it is common to carry hunting guns ,” the state said.After the initial ambush killed six civilians, angry villagers clashed with the Army, leading to the death of another seven villagers and a soldier.

"Ratapani Tiger Reserve: Three Cubs struck by train on MP's Midghat track: One dead, tigress returns hindering rescue ops",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/three-cubs-struck-by-train-on-mps-midghat-track-one-dead-tigress-returns-hindering-rescue-ops/articleshow/111762438.cms,"BHOPAL: The West Central Railway (WCR) Budhni-Midghat railway section , which passes through the yet-to-be-notified ' Ratapani Tiger Reserve ' in Sehore district of Madhya Pradesh , has once again proved to be a death trap for tigers.A train ran over three tiger cubs , killing one and injuring two on Sunday night. The rescue operation for the injured cubs initiated on Monday had to be halted as the mother tigress , returned to the tracks in search of her cubs, preventing forest authorities from intervening.According to officials, the incident occurred on tracks in a territorial forest area within the Sehore division where the cubs might have been following the tigress to get across the track. Senior forest officials arrived at the scene, and the carcass of the deceased cub was taken to Budhni. However, the rescue operation for the injured cubs was withdrawn when the mother tigress came too close to the scene, forcing officials to retreat.""We had to hold the rescue operation due to the tigress, which came around 20 meters close to the officers there, and there was a chance of attack. The cubs are injured and are not in a condition to move. We are keeping a close watch on them from a safe distance. They will be rescued once the tigress moves away,"" Chief Conservator of Forests (CCF) Rajesh Khare told the TOI. The cubs are to be rescued with nets and shifted to Van Vihar for treatment.The tigress was initially heard roaring near the accident site. When she approached the injured cubs, officials decided to watch from a safer distance and halt the operation. The accident occurred near pole No 800/18, where the cubs were found lying in a canal. CCF Khare noted that the cubs were not in a condition to move.This particular stretch of railway has witnessed multiple tiger deaths in recent years. The WCR had previously assured forest officers that trains would maintain a speed of 25 km/h while passing through the wildlife area. The 26.5 km long Barkhera-Budni section, part of the Bhopal-Itarsi section's third-line construction, was sanctioned in 2011-12 by the railway board. The project includes 41.42 km of the Habibganj-Barkhera track and 25 km of the Budni-Itarsi track. Sections 1 and 3 are in plain territory and have no wildlife or forest-related issues. The problem lies with section 2, the Barkhera-Budni section, where the existing tracks fall within the Ratapani Wildlife Sanctuary or its eco-sensitive zone. Ratapani is being notified as a tiger reserve due to the presence of several tigers in the area.Despite assurances from railway officials, mitigation measures were not fully implemented. In recent years, more than six leopards and an equal number of tigers have been killed on this track. Railway officers claim they have made efforts to minimize disruption, including reducing the railway line's length within the reserve. The recent cub's death has raised concerns among top-ranking forest officers, with some seeking action against responsible railway officers. ""The railway has done nothing. NHAI is building some underpasses which are not sufficient,"" said one officer.A retired forest officer emphasized the dire situation: ""The remaining two cubs are fatally wounded; the mother is very upset. If Railways cannot do anything, the most critical portion of Midghat, where several accidents have occurred, should be fenced on either side starting from the mouth of the tunnel by the forest department."" He further suggested that the state's chief wildlife warden commission a rapid study to determine the fence's length. ""There is a bend in the track just around the mouth of the tunnel which makes it difficult for the animals to see any approaching train. Fatal accidents have increased after the laying of the third railway track,"" he added.Wildlife activist Ajay Dubey criticized the state forest department's failure to adopt mitigation measures. ""Repeated accidents in the Midghat section are very serious. This should be considered a case of criminal negligence against the officers accountable for the deaths,"" Dubey claimed. Madhya Pradesh has lost around 23 tigers this year to date.Former chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan approved the notification of Ratapani as a tiger reserve in January 2022. However, the delay in implementing this decision is believed to contribute significantly to the dispersal of tigers in the area. Despite receiving in-principle approval from the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) in 2008, Ratapani has not yet been officially notified as a tiger reserve. Covering over 890 square kilometers in the Bhopal-Raisen Forest division, Ratapani has the necessary characteristics and resources to serve as a crucial tiger habitat. Recently, Chief Minister Dr. Mohan Yadav has instructed concerned officers to expedite the process and notify Ratapani as the state's eighth tiger reserve.","A train ran over three tiger cubs, killing one and injuring two on Sunday night.

This event was dubbed the Battle of the Billionaires. Stone Cold Steve Austin served as the special referee, and ultimately, Umaga lost the match, resulting in Vince McMahon getting his head shaved.","The former WWE World Champion and the Mayor of Knox County, Tennessee, Kane, recently commented on the recent assassination attempt on Donald Trump.

A corporate litigator at a prestigious law firm in San Francisco, has clerked for Chief Justice John Roberts of the Supreme Court , as well as for Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his tenure as an appeals court judge.Raised in a suburb of San Diego, California, Usha's upbringing emphasised education and hard work. Her academic journey saw her serving as Managing Editor of the Yale Journal of Law & Technology and Executive Development Editor of The Yale Law Journal. As a Gates fellow at Cambridge, she engaged with left-wing and liberal groups and was a registered Democrat in 2014.Usha and JD Vance first met at Yale Law School and were married in Kentucky in 2014. Their wedding included a Hindu priest presiding over a separate ceremony. The couple has three children together.Usha Vance has been instrumental in her husband's political success. She played a key role in helping JD Vance organise his thoughts on the social decline in rural white America, which inspired his best-selling memoir, ""Hillbilly Elegy."" The memoir was adapted into a film directed by Ron Howard in 2020.In the past, Usha has made some rare public appearances alongside JD Vance during his campaign from the Ohio Senate seat.As the US presidential elections approach, former President Donald Trump announced JD Vance as his Vice Presidential pick. Trump confirmed Vance's candidacy through a social media post.""Usha Vance is a highly accomplished attorney and daughter of Indian immigrants—and her husband brings youth and diversity to the Trump ticket,"" said AI Mason, a US-based global real estate investment advisor and entrepreneur, speaking to ANI.

Everything he says and does is built on a foundation of so much thought. He's always trying to do better,"" said Usha Vance.On supporting her husband, Usha told Fox, ""There are a few different reasons...One is that I grew up in a religious household. My parents are Hindu, and that was one of the things that made them such good parents, that makes them really very good people. And so I think I've seen that...the power of that in my own life, and I knew that JD was searching for something. This just felt right for him.""The interview was conducted three weeks before JD Vance was announced as Trump's running mate for the upcoming US presidential elections.JD Vance was born James David Bowman in Middletown, Ohio, to a mother who struggled with addiction and a father who left the family when he was a toddler. Raised by his grandparents, Vance's challenging early life shaped his perspectives.The Trump campaign has stated that following his near-death experience, the former president will focus on calling for unity in times of tragedy, instead of criticising his political adversaries. This approach will be pivotal as he faces off against President Biden in the 2024 election rematch.","Usha Chilukuri Vance is the wife of J D Vance, who was recently announced as Donald Trump's vice presidential pick for the upcoming US elections.

One protester wore an orange prison jumpsuit with a giant Trump cutout for a face. Activists carried signs that read, ""Stand with Palestine,"" ""We Can No Longer Afford the Rich,"" and ""Defend and Expand Immigrant Rights.""At one point a group of demonstrators got in an argument with counter-protesters who denounced LGBTQ+ rights, Muslims, Black Lives Matter and women.Counter-protester Rich Penkoski of Stillwater, Oklahoma, bellowed through a bullhorn that women should go home and make sandwiches for their husbands. The demonstrators eventually walked away from the counter-protesters as police looked on.At noon, the demonstrators set off on the march around the arena's security perimeter in temperatures approaching 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius), chanting ""Hey-hey, ho-ho, Republicans have got to go"" and ""This is what democracy looks like."" Many carried Palestinian flags.Marchers passed within a block of Fiserv Forum on the edge of the arena's security zone before returning to the downtown park where they began. The Milwaukee Police Department estimated the crowd at between 700 and 800 people and said no one was arrested. However, an Associated Press reporter saw a man in handcuffs being held by police outside the park after the march ended. An officer told him he was being arrested for disorderly conduct, though it wasn't immediately clear what led to the arrest or if the man was part of the protest.Milwaukee police did not respond to messages Monday night asking for arrest totals.The Philadelphia-based group Poor People's Army, which advocates for economic justice, marched later Monday.Perennial Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein addressed the group, calling for less military spending and larger investments in public education, social housing and health care. She didn't mention the assassination attempt.Cheri Honkala, 60, said she traveled to Milwaukee from one of the poorest districts in Pennsylvania to ""send a strong message to all politicians"" that people living below the poverty line ""are not surviving.""Honkala said she was nervous after the attempted assassination of Trump about potential encounters with law enforcement officers and counter protesters while she marches with the Poor People's Army. But she said she wasn't deterred.""The climate is definitely a scary one,"" she said, ""but you know what's scarier? Not saying anything.""Honkala was at the front of the march near the arena when officers asked her to move to the sidewalk. She refused and stayed in the road as more officers arrived and again asked her to move.At one point she turned to the group and said, ""I'm just a little woman. I'm just a little woman. I'm not going to hurt anyone."" Officers handcuffed her and led her away.By Monday night, the streets of downtown Milwaukee were largely quiet.At one of the convention's main entrances, a sole anti-Trump protester stood holding a sign, telling those entering the arena to ""enjoy the clown show.""Anthony Marlow, a retired sanitation worker, said he had spent the day protesting the convention, arguing at times with Trump supporters.""I want them to know they are not welcome in this great city,"" he said. Referencing Trump's reported denigration of Milwaukee weeks earlier, Marlow said Trump doesn't appreciate Milwaukee.The attempted assassination of Trump on Saturday night in Pennsylvania prompted widespread calls to improve security and raised questions about Trump's safety in Milwaukee - he arrived in the city on Sunday - as well as that of other convention-goers.US Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle said Monday that the Secret Service and other law enforcement agencies have ""reviewed and strengthened"" the convention security plan and they will continuously adapt their operations as needed. She added that the Secret Service also has made changes to Trump's security detail. She didn't elaborate.A heavy police presence in the city was assured, with officers from multiple jurisdictions providing security. Pentagon officials said 1,700 National Guard troops, mostly from Minnesota, Wisconsin and North Dakota, were on active duty at the convention as well. Milwaukee officials and federal authorities have repeatedly said their priority is safety and insist they've made free speech accommodations.Many activists are using the experience in Milwaukee to prepare for the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next month. That event is expected to draw even more people, and Chicago police have been undergoing training on constitutional policing and preparing for the possibility of mass arrests.","The protests were peaceful, as organizers had promised they would be.

Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina says she is ""taking measures"" after a slew of corruption scandals -- including one involving her former household servant who now travels by helicopter after amassing a staggering $34 million fortune.Recent accusations dominating Bangladesh's normally pliant media have involved a former army chief, an ex-police chief, senior tax officers and state recruitment officials.""Corruption is a longstanding problem,"" Hasina told reporters late Sunday. ""These messes must be cleaned up... we have been taking measures.""She said that included action against her household assistant -- a ""peon"" or low-level orderly -- who Bangladeshi media reported had previously been a water-bearer, in case she needed a drink at events.""The man who worked as a peon in my house -- he now owns 400,00,00,000 Taka ($34 million),"" Hasina said.""He can't move without a helicopter. How has he earned so much money? I took action immediately after knowing this.""It would take an average Bangladeshi more than 13,000 years to earn that amount.The average GDP per capita in the nation of around 170 million people is $2,529, according to the World Bank .Hasina did not identify the servant, but several newspapers named him as Jahangir Alam, nicknamed ""Pani"" or ""water"" , due to his old job.The Dhaka Tribune daily reported the orderly had used his position in Hasina's office to engage in ""lobbying, tender manipulation and bribery"".The fat-cat servant report spread rapidly on social media -- with opposition parties seizing on it to accuse Hasina's administration of endemic corruption.""If Sheikh Hasina's peon could make such an astronomical amount of money, you can guess how much his boss has made,"" said A.K.M. Wahiduzzaman, a spokesman for the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), the main opposition party.""The most shocking thing is he has not been prosecuted for his crime,"" he added.""He was just removed from his post"".Hasina, 76, won her fourth consecutive general election in January, in a vote without genuine opposition parties, with a widespread boycott and a major crackdown against her political opponents.But since May, a series of high-profile corruption scandals have put the spotlight on her more than 15-year-long rule.The anti-corruption commission launched a probe into former national police chief Benazir Ahmed -- once viewed as a close Hasina ally -- accused of stashing an illegal multi-million dollar fortune. He rejects the allegations.Washington imposed sanctions against Ahmed in 2021, for his alleged role in hundreds of disappearances and extrajudicial killings when he led the feared Rapid Action Battalion paramilitary force.Top local newspapers have also laid out graft allegations against the former army chief of the capital Dhaka, Aziz Ahmed. He denies the claims.The anti-corruption commission has ordered the seizure of properties and frozen the bank accounts of several top tax officials for allegedly syphoning off tens of millions of dollars.Last week, police busted a gang of civil servants selling recruitment papers before job tests, reportedly illegally generating millions of dollars.","Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina says she is ""taking measures"" after a slew of corruption scandals.

This decision follows heavy criticism of his performance in their first debate last month.In the first debate on June 28, Biden faced several verbal missteps. He struggled with a raspy voice and halting delivery while defending his economic record and criticizing Trump.Notably, he referred to ""billionaires"" as ""trillionaires"" before correcting himself and had an extended, awkward pause while discussing tax increases on the wealthy. The 81-year-old also seemed to lose his train of thought while addressing the national debt.The debate was marked by hostility, with personal attacks exchanged between the two candidates. Biden accused Trump of having the ""morals of an alley cat"" and brought up Trump's alleged affair with porn star Stormy Daniels. He also pointed out Trump's status as a convicted felon.President Biden also expressed confidence in the Secret Service during the interview on Tuesday, following an assassination attempt on Trump over the weekend. Biden praised the agents for risking their lives but mentioned it was still an ""open question"" whether they should have anticipated the shooting at a Trump campaign rally in Pennsylvania.Biden commented on the recent dismissal of a case involving Trump's handling of classified documents, describing the decision as ""specious.""

Second Amendment

Biden to the rescue?

A deeply polarising figure in US politics, Donald Trump came close to being killed on Sunday when a bullet fired from a semi-automatic rifle grazed his right ear at a rally in Pennsylvania. The world is perhaps focused more on what impact it will have on the outcome of the impending presidential polls, but the shooting has again foregrounded the vexed issue of gun violence in America , where more than 32% of the people apparently own a firearm.In the same Pennsylvania state where the assassination attempt took place, the Republican presidential candidate earlier this year vowed to roll back — on the first day of assuming office — all restrictions imposed by the Biden administration on gun rights.“Every single Biden attack on gun owners and manufacturers will be terminated my very first week back in office, perhaps my first day,’’ said Trump. Not surprisingly, he was addressing an event organised by the National Rifle Association (NRA), the most ardent backer of an individual’s right to keep and bear firearms . In his previous term, Trump appointed conservative judges in Supreme Court, at the behest of the NRA, to bolster this right.Despite acknowledging the need to check mass shootings — there were over 600 such cases in 2023 alone — the US has not been able to seriously consider passing legislation to ban assault weapons. The political polarisation over the issue precludes the US from reaching a national gun policy that could restrict misuse of firearms.According to a Pew Research Centre report last year, Republicans and Democrats remain sharply divided over the impact of gun ownership on public safety. While 79% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents said gun ownership increases safety, a nearly identical share of Democrats (78%) said it decreases safety.US gun policy, or the lack of it, dates back to the US Constitution Second Amendment which was ratified in 1791 and owes its origin, apparently, among other things, to the English practice of raising a militia to fight foreign invasion. The amendment simply states, “A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed”, and leaves the rest to interpretation. More than 200 years later, in a landmark ruling in 2008, US Supreme Court sought to settle the debate as it held that the Second Amendment conferred an individual right to keep and to bear arms, including for self-defence at home, even when there is no relationship to a local militia.After America got its independence and its Constitution was taking shape, there were fears of a tyrannical federal govt riding roughshod over ordinary citizens. One of the Founding Fathers, James Madison, sought to allay those apprehensions as he said such a government “would be opposed by a militia amounting to nearly half a million of citizens with arms in their hands”.The amendment does not specifically mention self-defence. With powerful backers like the Republicans and NRA, the argument that the Second Amendment might be outdated at a time the US has the most powerful national defence system in the world — and public safety and crime prevention must outweigh an individual’s right to self-defence — has found little traction. While some states like California do have stricter regulations, according to NRA, if a person can legally purchase and own a gun, the Second Amendment guarantees his or her right to keep and bear arms regardless of city or state.The US President’s son was himself convicted last month for illegally purchasing a gun but that hasn’t prevented Biden from touting his gun control measures during his election campaign. The Biden administration recently announced new rules to reduce the number of firearms sold without background checks as part of its strategy to stem the flow of illegally acquired firearms and hold to account those who supply firearms used in crime. The president has also called for banning assault weapons. The Republicans have mostly described it as misguided and unconstitutional.According to White House, the loopholes in America’s background check laws have enabled domestic abusers, school shooters, violent criminals, and gun traffickers to illegally acquire firearms. A growing number of unlicensed sellers continue to sell firearms for profit to complete strangers they meet at gun shows and online marketplaces, which has been a critical gap in the background check laws.In 2022, Biden signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act that broadens the category of gun sellers required to become licensed dealers and run background checks. While the US has about 80,000 licensed gun sellers, it also has over 20,000 unlicensed ones who sell mostly through online advertisements. The final rule announced this year makes it clear when a person needs to become a licensed dealer and run background checks. It also gives the Department of Justice additional tools to crack down on individuals illegally selling guns without such checks, says White House.With the new rules, according to Biden, the US is moving as close as possible to universal background checks without additional legislation. Given the opposition from the Republicans, and a deeply divided country on what is a worrisome but emotive issue, any effort for a Congress approval to a ban on assault weapons remains out of the question for now.","US gun policy, or the lack of it, dates back to the US Constitution Second Amendment which was ratified in 1791.

He also worked as a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley.""Hillbilly Elegy"" became a bestseller, offering insight into the struggles of working-class, rural Americans. The book's success introduced Vance to the Trump family, leading to a friendship with Donald Trump Jr.In 2016, Vance was a ""never Trump"" Republican, calling Trump ""dangerous"" and ""unfit."" He also criticised Trump's racist rhetoric, calling Trump 'America's Hitler'. By 2021, Vance reversed his stance, praising Trump's accomplishments and downplaying his past criticism.Vance now echoes Trump's rhetoric about Jan. 6 and the 2020 election, saying he wouldn't have certified the results immediately and that Trump had “a very legitimate grievance.”In the Senate, Vance works with both parties. He co-sponsored a railway safety bill with Sen. Sherrod Brown and supported Great Lakes restoration and legislation for workers and families.In 2022, Vance was elected to the US Senate, filling the seat vacated by Republican Rob Portman. Trump's endorsement was pivotal in Vance’s victory. Despite initially criticising Trump in 2016, Vance later became a staunch supporter, regularly defending Trump's policies and actions.","US President Joe Biden's campaign slammed Donald Trump's vice-presidential pick, JD Vance.

And number two, my mental acuity has been pretty damn good.""He highlighted his accomplishments during his presidency, expressing his willingness to be evaluated based on his record.Biden's resolve to remain in the race persists, even as some Democratic lawmakers question his ability to effectively challenge Trump following his performance in the June 27 debate. He stressed that Democratic voters had chosen him during the primary season and that he listens to them.When asked about who he consults on campaign decisions , Biden's answer was simple: ""Me. I've been doing this a long time.""The current state of the race, according to Biden, was always anticipated to be close. A recent NBC news poll supports this, showing Trump with a narrow lead over Biden, although the poll also revealed that a majority of Democrats would prefer a different candidate, and a significant portion of all voters expressed concerns about Biden's mental and physical abilities.In his efforts to demonstrate his competence post-debate, Biden has occasionally stumbled, such as referring to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as ""President Putin"" and his vice president, Kamala Harris, as ""Vice President Trump."" However, he maintained that he is fully in command, saying, ""What I'm doing is going out and demonstrating to the American people that I'm in command of all my faculties. I don't need notes. I don't need teleprompters. I can go out and answer any questions at all.""Biden also criticized the media for not subjecting Trump to the same level of scrutiny, pointing out fact-checks that showed Trump making multiple incorrect statements during the debate. He challenged the press, asking, ""Why doesn't the press ever talk about this?"" and questioned why they weren't discussing the lies Trump told during the debate, even as Biden acknowledged having a bad night himself.","US President Joe Biden has stood by his choice to continue his presidential campaign.

The couple met at Yale University, married in 2014, and live in Cincinnati with three kids.“After lengthy deliberation and thought, and considering the tremendous talents of many others, I have decided that the person best suited to assume the position of Vice President of the United States is Senator JD Vance of the Great State of Ohio,"" Trump said in a post on his Truth Social network.Trump’s shortlist included Florida senator Marco Rubio, North Dakota governor Doug Burgum, Arkansas senator Tom Cotton and South Carolina senator Tim Scott. Indian-Americans Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy were both considered long-shot outliers.Surviving the assassination bid and the halo of heroism that came with it appeared to have changed the dynamics involved in Trump’s selection. Rather than weigh race, gender, ethnicity and other factors, Trump seems to have sought someone in his own likeness in terms of policy and succession.Vance is the author of “Hillbilly Elegy”, a best-selling 2016 memoir about growing up in an unstable family in hollowed out middle America amid poverty, job loss, economic insecurity and social rot. His wife Usha is from a totally different social eco-system. Her father is a mechanical engineer and mother a biologist, who made it good in San Diego, California.Each candidate on Trump’s shortlist had detractors within the party. Vance himself is reported to have called Trump “America’s Hitler”, a “cynical a*****e”, “a total fraud,” and “a moral disaster” at one point. But like many Republicans who sought relevance in the Trump era, Vance eventually shifted his tone. He said he was proved wrong by Trump’s performance in office and evolved into one of his most steadfast defenders. “I didn’t think he was going to be a good prez,” Vance recently told Fox News Channel. “He was a great president.”Also such things are easily forgotten and forgiven in US politics, and anyone chosen by Trump will have the party’s backing — particularly after the weekend tumult that has enhanced the cult of personality in the Grand Old Party.Vance was elected to the Senate in 2022 and has become one of the staunchest champions of “Make America Great Again” agenda. But he is largely untested in national politics and himself faced criticism in the wake of the shooting for an X post that suggested President Biden was to blame for the violence.Trump’s pick also means that two white men will now lead the Republican ticket at a time when Trump has sought to make inroads with Black and Latino voters.","Vance is the author of ‘Hillbilly Elegy’, a best-selling 2016 memoir about growing up in an unstable family in hollowed out middle America.

Although Kennedy's chances of winning the presidency or even Electoral College votes are slim, his campaign events have attracted significant crowds interested in his message.In a statement, Kennedy expressed his gratitude to President Biden for providing him with Secret Service protection and also thanked his private security firm, Gavin de Becker & Associates, ""for keeping me safe for the past 15 months of my presidential campaign,"" according to a report from AP.Alejandro Mayorkas, the Homeland Security Secretary, confirmed that Biden had ordered protection for Kennedy both before and after the recent events.While the Secret Service is obligated to protect major party presidential and vice presidential candidates and their families 120 days before a general election, third-party candidates are considered on a case-by-case basis. The Department of Homeland Security acknowledged in its 2024 budget overview that requests for candidate protection are being made earlier than in previous years.Political candidates often face threats, but law enforcement officials have noted an increase in violent rhetoric following the attack at the Trump rally over the weekend. Mayorkas emphasised that both Biden and Trump are ""constantly the subject of threats,"" adding, ""We are in a heightened and very dynamic threat environment.""Kennedy, who challenged Biden for the Democratic nomination last year before launching an independent bid, has the potential to perform better than any third-party presidential candidate since Ross Perot in the 1990s, thanks to his well-known name and loyal base.However, he did not participate in the first presidential debate on June 27, as both the Biden and Trump campaigns, fearing he could be a spoiler, bypassed the nonpartisan debate commission and agreed to a schedule that essentially excluded Kennedy.Trump officially became the Republican presidential nominee on Monday after receiving the necessary delegate votes at the Republican National Convention. He was not seriously injured in the shooting in Pennsylvania over the weekend, which is currently under independent review.Mayorkas said that Trump's protection has been enhanced based on the ""evolving nature of the threats to the former president"" and his transition from presumptive nominee to nominee.","US President Joe Biden has instructed the US Secret Service to safeguard independent presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr. Kennedy's chances of winning the presidency are slim, but his campaign events have attracted significant crowds.

He will face Biden again in November.Trump's nomination became official with the vote of Republican National Committee delegates in Milwaukee. He hit the threshold with votes from Florida, announced by his son Eric, according to AP report. The convention hall erupted in cheers as state after state voiced support for Trump.Trump's campaign, aiming to expand his appeal among moderates and people of color, designed an optimistic convention. However, the shooting incident targeted at Trump disrupted American politics, redirecting focus from the GOP's agenda and Trump's legal issues to concerns about political violence and national stability.Vivek Ramaswamy , a former GOP primary candidate, shifted his aggressive rhetoric, urging the country to unite. Speaking at an event hosted by the conservative Heritage Institute, Ramaswamy said, “The enemy is not the Democrats, it is an ideology.”Hours before the first convention session, Trump received favorable news when a federal judge dismissed the prosecution in his classified documents case. Trump celebrated the dismissal on his Truth Social platform, calling for the dismissal of his other legal cases as well.“As we move forward in Uniting our Nation after the horrific events on Saturday, this dismissal of the Lawless Indictment in Florida should be just the first step, followed quickly by the dismissal of ALL the Witch Hunts,” Trump wrote.Republican Party chairman Michael Whatley said that the convention’s programming would not change following the shooting. The agenda will feature over 100 speakers focusing on everyday issues and Trump’s plans to help working Americans.“We have to be able to lay out a vision for where we want to take this country,” Whatley said. He emphasized that the central message would focus on future plans rather than past grievances or promises of retribution.“We are going to have the convention that we have been planning for the last 18 months. We are a combination of relieved and grateful that the president is going to be here and is going to accept the nomination,” he added.Delegates will update the GOP’s policy platform, which has not been revised since 2016. The proposed platform, just 16 pages long, avoids giving Democrats ammunition on key issues, including abortion. It doesn’t call for a national abortion ban, despite the Supreme Court’s recent decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.“More divisiveness would not be healthy,” said Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council.The convention’s speaking program will include Republicans charged with crimes related to the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. Former White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, jailed for contempt of Congress, is expected to speak after his release. Nevada GOP Chair Michael McDonald , also facing criminal charges related to the 2020 election, will present Trump with the party nomination.Democrats have scaled back counterprogramming during the Republican convention. The Biden campaign pulled down its ads, and Vice President Kamala Harris postponed a Florida appearance focused on Trump’s opposition to abortion rights.

The announcement was made on Trump's Truth Social media platform at the beginning of the four-day Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where the party's presidential ticket will be nominated.In his statement on Truth Social, Trump said, ""After lengthy deliberation and thought, and considering the tremendous talents of many others, I have decided that the person best suited to assume the position of Vice President of the United States is Senator JD Vance of the Great State of Ohio.""James David Vance, the author of the bestselling memoir ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" is deeply popular among Trump's base, and his selection could increase the likelihood of Trump supporters turning out to vote on November 5.However, as a staunch conservative from a Republican state, Vance may not attract many new voters to Trump's camp and could even alienate some moderates. Some Trump supporters had advocated for the selection of a woman or person of colour as his running mate to expand a coalition that is predominantly composed of white men, according to a report from Reuters.Vance, 39, will bring a younger perspective to the election, which features Trump, 78, and President Joe Biden, 81. This choice provides a counterbalance to the Democratic ticket, which includes Vice President Kamala Harris, 59. In choosing Vance, Trump passed over other potential candidates, such as US Senators Marco Rubio and Tim Scott, as well as North Dakota governor Doug Burgum.Vance's rise to prominence has been unconventional in American politics. Following a difficult and impoverished upbringing in southern Ohio, he served in the Marine Corps, earned a scholarship to Yale Law School, and later worked as a venture capitalist in San Francisco.His book ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" published in 2016, explored the socioeconomic challenges faced by his hometown and the cycle of poverty that had trapped Americans in the Appalachian Mountains, where his mother and her family originated. The book criticised what Vance perceived as a self-destructive culture in rural America and aimed to explain Trump's popularity among impoverished white Americans, according to a report from Reuters.Despite his initial harsh criticism of Trump before and after the 2016 election, Vance transformed into one of the former president's most consistent defenders as he prepared to run for the US Senate in Ohio in 2022. He has downplayed the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol and echoed Trump's criticisms of the Justice Department's prosecution of January 6 rioters.Vance has also been a vocal opponent of continued aid to Ukraine in the Senate, a position that differs from many Republican legislative leaders.As a former venture capitalist, Vance has served as a link between Trump associates and wealthy Silicon Valley donors, many of whom have contributed to Trump's campaign this election. However, some Trump associates have privately questioned the wisdom of removing Vance from the Senate, given the close contest between Democrats and Republicans for control of the upper chamber.","Former US President Donald Trump on Monday announced his selection of JD Vance as his running mate for the upcoming presidential election.

""We believe Article 17 of the Constitution gives the govt the right to ban political parties.""Tarar said that besides Imran and Alvi, the govt had decided to slap a treason case on ex-deputy speaker Qasim Suri under Article 6 for dissolving the assemblies in April 2022 despite a no-confidence motion moved against the then government in parliament.“The reference, under Article 6, will be sent to the apex court after being approved by the cabinet,"" he said.Article 6 states, ""Any person who abrogates or subverts or suspends, or holds in abeyance or attempts or conspires to abrogate or subvert or suspend the Constitution by use of force, or show force or by any other unconstitutional means shall be guilty of high treason.""The minister said the Sharif govt would also submit a review petition in the apex court, challenging its verdict on reserved seats.Lawyer-politician Moiz Jaferii said a political party couldn't be banned other than through a reference to the apex court. He termed the govt's move ""ridiculous and desperate posturing by a regime exposed day by day for its lack of legitimacy and popular appeal"".Activist and lawyer Jibran Nasir said the coalition govt's pursuit of a ban on PTI ""not only shows how weak PML-N is but also how desperate and frustrated the establishment has become"".Last week, the govt authorised Pakistan's ISI to intercept phone calls and messages ""in the interest of national security"" amid nationwide outrage over the allegedly unbridled powers the spy agency already enjoys.","The governing coalition's step is seen as an attempt to block PTI from becoming the single largest party in the National Assembly. Information minister Atta Tarar claimed that if the country was to progress, this couldn't happen as long as PTI remained part of the democratic polity.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111768590,imgsize-1118078,width-400,resizemode-4/111768590.jpg"
"Jailed former PM Imran Khan, wife handed over to anti-graft body on remand in fresh corruption case",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/jailed-former-pm-imran-khan-wife-handed-over-to-anti-graft-body-on-remand-in-fresh-corruption-case/articleshow/111735541.cms,"ISLAMABAD: A court in Pakistan on Sunday handed over jailed former prime minister Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi to the country's anti-corruption officials on an eight-day remand for probe in a fresh case of alleged corruption. The former first couple was arrested by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) soon after a district and sessions court on Saturday quashed their conviction in their un-Islamic marriage case.The court's short order also stated to release Khan and Bibi immediately unless they were wanted in other cases.The NAB, which filed a new Toshakhana case against the couple, on Sunday presented them before Judge Muhammad Ali Warraich of the accountability court.The judge conducted the hearing inside the Adiala Jail due to security reasons.NAB Deputy Director Mohsin Haroon, who led the team to arrest them, requested their physical remand and the court, after hearing the lawyers, agreed to grant an eight-day remand.The court then ordered to present the two on July 22.The remand period can be extended to a maximum of 40 days at the request of NAB if it is needed to probe the suspects.Khan, objecting to the absence of media, said at the beginning of the hearing: ""If the media is not allowed, I will walk out of the court.""The court subsequently ordered media representatives to be brought inside the jail, and the hearing commenced once they arrived.Khan, 71, then addressed the judge directly, asserting that his wife had no involvement in the Toshakhana case, The Express Tribune reported.""I have read the Quran four times in jail, and it places a great responsibility on judges,"" he stated. ""Bushra Bibi is only imprisoned to cause me distress.""Bibi, 49, was also re-arrested on Saturday in the new NAB reference as she was to be released from Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail.He accused higher authorities of targeting his wife due to his decisions and said: ""My wife is being targeted by the King because I removed him from the ISI position, and my wife did not support him.""He referred to the army chief Gen. Asim Munir without naming him.""Jail me, but leave my wife alone. Judge, you are answerable to Allah, not the ISI. Judge Bashir said a decision was made at gunpoint,"" Khan pleaded.""A former prime minister being told in the middle of the night that he has to appear for a brand new case in the morning,"" he remarked wryly.He harshly criticised the accountability watchdog and alleged that it was operating like robots, doing whatever they are paid to do.He added, ""In the previous case, the jewellery set, which was valued at Rs 18 million, was claimed to be worth Rs 3.25 billion.""""I am only speaking about my wife. Re-arresting her [Bushra Bibi] was a grave mistake,"" the cricketer-turned-politician said.The new Toshakhana case is based on the accusation that the couple during Khan's government purchased gifts from the state depository in violation of rules.This is the third Toshakhana case and Khan's sentence in the two previous Toshakhana cases had been suspended by the Islamabad High Court.Last week, the Supreme Court in a key judgment declared that Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party was eligible for the seats reserved for women and minorities in the National Assembly and four provincial assemblies.The PTI will become the largest party in the National Assembly with 109 seats after the Supreme Court ruling.Two successive victories for Khan were being interpreted as some change of heart on the part of the powerful establishment towards the PTI and its founder, but the subsequent developments belie any such possibility.Khan faces a slew of cases launched against him since his ouster from power in April 2022 after he fell out with the establishment which was believed to be instrumental in bringing him to power.",Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi handed over to anti-corruption officials.

Tough road ahead for Imran Khan despite back-to-back judicial relief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/tough-road-ahead-for-imran-khan-despite-back-to-back-judicial-relief/articleshow/111729030.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Despite back-to-back judicial relief to beleaguered Imran Khan , his woes are far from over and Pakistan 's former prime minister remains in jail with his wife Bushra Bibi. A district and session court on Saturday overturned the conviction of 71-year-old Khan and his wife Bushra, 49, in the un-Islamic marriage case related to the violation of the mandatory waiting period for a Muslim woman between two marriages.The relief came a day after the Supreme Court in a key judgment declared that his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) party was eligible for the seats reserved for women and minorities in the national and four provincial assemblies.The PTI will become the largest party in the National Assembly with 109 seats after the Supreme Court ruling.Two successive victories for Khan were being interpreted as some kind of change of heart on the part of the powerful establishment towards the PTI and its founder, but the subsequent developments belie any such possibility.The court in the Iddat case verdict stated that Khan and his wife should be released ""if not required to be detained in any other case"" and anticipating his release a large number of PTI supporters accompanied by key leaders reached the Adiala Jail Rawalpindi, where they have been kept, to welcome them.But the PTI feared counter-measures by the government and announced that Khan would be arrested in three cases related to May 9 violence. However, it emerged that he and his wife were taken into custody by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB ) in a fresh Toshakhana corruption case .Khan and his wife during his government allegedly obtained gifts from the gift repository at low prices and sold them at higher rates.It is the third Toshakhana case and Khan's sentence in the two previous Toshakhana cases had been suspended by the Islamabad High Court.The new case alleged that the couple got some precious watches and other gifts from the state depository by violating rules.Khan faces a slew of cases launched against him since his ouster from power in April 2022 after he fell out with the establishment which was believed to be instrumental in bringing him to power.Despite dozens of cases against him and several party leaders, he has kept up his rhetoric by attacking the senior Army leadership , and his supporters churning out half-baked stories against the establishment on social media.The Army this month after a key meeting termed the attack on social media as ""digital terrorism"", calling it ""unwarranted criticism by some quarters"".Army commanders stated that the onslaught of politically motivated digital terrorism, unleashed by conspirators, duly abetted by their foreign cohorts against state institutions is meant to induce despondency in the nation and sow discord through the peddling of blatant lies, fake news and propaganda.The forum affirmed that military leadership is cognizant of the full spectrum of the challenges and resolved to shoulder its constitutionally mandated responsibilities with the support of the resilient people of Pakistan.Khan on his side uses the presence of media on the occasion of hearing cases against him in the Adiala Jail to fire salvos at rivals, showing unflinching resolve to fight. He also reiterates not to spare his tormentors.His own X handle is active, apparently operated by someone on his behalf, charging his opponents from the Army and civilians with an unwavering commitment. The same attitude has been displayed by his party leaders who often compete with each other to breathe more fire than others.All this had added to his hardships despite getting relief from the courts regularly.In the latest arrest, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) is expected to produce Khan and his wife before an accountability judge to seek their physical remand. Under the law, NAB can detain a person for 40 days on remand for investigation.As courts operate within rules, it is not easy for his legal team to secure his release.The circuitous legal battle is getting more entangled due to the official opposition to his release from jail.Recently, political advisor to Prime Minister, Rana Sanaullah, reportedly stated that new cases would be lodged against Khan in the coming days. Talking to the reporters in Lahore on June 15, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal stated that Khan's detention for the next five years was necessary to bring economic stability.""People come to us and tell us if Pakistan has to progress then Imran Khan will have to be kept in jail for five years,"" he said.","A district and session court overturned the conviction of 71-year-old Khan and his wife Bushra, 49, in the un-Islamic marriage case.

"Despite acquittal in fake marriage case, Imran to remain in jail",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/despite-acquittal-in-fake-marriage-case-imran-to-remain-in-jail/articleshow/111719348.cms,"ISLAMABAD: A Pakistan district and sessions court acquitted former prime minister Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, on Saturday in a case of unlawful marriage . This was the last case keeping Khan in prison but he will not walk free as the authorities immediately issued fresh orders for his arrest in three other cases.In a short order, additional sessions judge Afzal Majoka directed authorities to immediately release Khan and his wife if they are not wanted in any other case.After the decision Khan’s party, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), said, “Mr Khan has been arrested in three more cases.” The three cases are linked to violence against the military and other state installations after his brief arrest in May 2023.“An anti-terrorism court in Lahore approved the request to arrest Imran Khan in the May 9 case,” the PTI statement read. The party warned that keeping Khan, 71, in jail after Saturday’s decision would lead to another political crisis.Just days before national polls on Feb 8 the couple were sentenced to seven years in jail in the “iddat” case after the court found them guilty of breaking Islamic law by failing to observe the required interval between Bibi’s divorce from her previous husband and her marriage to Khan. The verdict had coincided with his convictions and sentences in the Toshakhana (state treasure store) and cipher cases. His sentences in two alleged graft cases, however, were suspended, while his sentence in the cipher case, linked to leaking of state secrets, was overturned. Various courts have also freed him in several other cases linked to the events of May 9, 2023 when his first arrest had caused riots across the country, following which the state launched a crackdown against him and his party.Ahead of Khan’s acquittal in a fake marriage case , a pair of applications was filed by Khawar Fareed Maneka, Bushra’s previous husband. One application asked the court to carry out a medical checkup of his ex-wife to ascertain her menstrual cycle while the other called on religious scholars for consultation on further deliberation on the duration of “iddat”.Before ordering Khan and his wife’s release, judge Majoka dismissed both applications. “Both petitions seeking the formation of a medical board and consultations with religious scholars are hereby rejected,” the verdict stated.Khan has been behind bars since August 2023. He blames powerful military generals for his ouster from power in April 2022.","Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, acquitted in a case of unlawful marriage. This was the last case keeping Khan in prison but he will not walk free as the authorities immediately issued fresh orders for his arrest in three other cases.
