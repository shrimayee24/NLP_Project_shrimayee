Mark Zuckerberg on Llama, AI, & Minus One

""So I kind of think, based on what we're seeing now with the Ray-Ban Metas, I would guess that display-less AI glasses at like the $300 point are going to be a really big product that, like tens of millions of people, or hundreds of millions of people eventually are going to have, and you're going to have super interactive AI that you're talking to,""

Facebook-parent Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has criticised the current social media experience that is available on smartphones. In a South Park Commons interview shared on YouTube, he described the social media experience on mobile phones as ""anti-social."" However, Zuckerberg believes wearable tech , such as smart glasses , can improve this.Talking to former Facebook employees Ruchi Sanghvi and Aditya Agarwal, Zuckerberg expressed his belief that the limitations of small screens hinder social media engagement.He emphasised Meta's focus on developing smart glasses, like the Ray-Ban smart glasses, as a solution.In the interview, Zuckerberg explains how interacting with social media on wearables like smart glasses is better than on smartphones. Check out the interview here (Cue 10:15):He said: ""When you're building social apps, it's kind of this weird thing that you primarily are delivering through this tiny little screen that people carry around. It's like a really, in some ways, anti-social form factor. It's part of the reason why I care so much about glasses. It's just such a more natural thing.”Meta's smart glasses, launched in 2020, provide functionalities like photo-taking, Instagram livestreaming, and AI assistant access. Unlike the Meta Quest VR headset, these glasses do not offer augmented reality. Despite this, Zuckerberg remains optimistic about the future of wearable tech.In another recent interview with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, Zuckerberg also said that he believes display-less AI glasses will be worn by millions of people.he said.","Mark Zuckerberg has criticised the current social media experience that is available on smartphones.

These professionals, known as sleepmakers , aim to induce sleep through calming conversations and emotional support before bedtime.Taozi, a part-time sleepmaker with a stable job, turned to this practice after experiencing its benefits firsthand. According to Guangzhou Daily , she found that discussing personal problems with a stranger helped clear out emotional baggage, leading to better sleep.""Discussing personal problems that are difficult to share with friends and family with a stranger might be the best way to clear out emotional garbage. Once this emotional garbage is taken care of, people tend to sleep better,"" Taozi said.Sleepmakers are categorised into different levels on the platform, with higher tiers earning more. A chief sleepmaker can earn up to 260 yuan (US$36) per hour, while a full-time sleepmaker can make up to 30,000 yuan (US$4,200) per month, plus tips, according to South China Morning Post.Most of Taozi's clients are young adults born in the 1990s and 2000s who seek a listening ear and emotional support to navigate life's challenges.Sleepmakers operate both online and offline.

Rachael Gunn: Who is Rachel Gunn AKA Raygun? Meet Australian Olympic breaker and university lecturer who scored zero points,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-rachel-gunn-aka-raygun-meet-australian-olympic-breaker-and-university-lecturer-who-scored-zero-points/articleshow/112445112.cms,"Rachael Gunn , better known by her stage name "" Raygun ,"" recently found herself in the eye of a social media storm following her participation in the 2024 Paris Olympics . As breakdancing made its historic debut as an Olympic sport, Gunn, representing Australia , performed with a distinctive style that set her apart from her competitors. However, instead of receiving praise for her originality, she became the target of widespread online trolling and criticism.Gunn, a 36-year-old university lecturer from Sydney with a Ph.D. in cultural studies, approached the competition with a creative and unconventional style. Her moves, which she described as entirely original, were a conscious effort to showcase something different and artistic rather than attempting to compete with her peers in terms of athletic prowess. One of her signature moves, the ""kangaroo hop,"" became particularly notorious, drawing both attention and ridicule online.One user wrote: “The Olympics has been turned into a complete worldwide laughing stock. Everything woke turns to sh*t.” Another added: “Mistakes were definitely made folks, but the biggest one was not telling someone they can't dance.” A third added: “We're all still trying to process how you qualified for the Olympics in the first place.”Others were more supportive. One wrote: “It takes guts to perform something so different on such a huge stage. Respect to Raygun for staying true to herself"". Another added: “Raygun might not have scored points, but she definitely scored in originality. The world needs more artists like her.”Despite her unique approach, Gunn’s performance did not translate into points on the scoreboard. She was eliminated early in the competition, losing all her round-robin battles without scoring. This result, combined with the unorthodox nature of her routine, made her an easy target for criticism. Social media quickly filled with memes and disparaging comments, with some users mocking her moves and questioning the inclusion of breakdancing in the Olympics altogether.The backlash against Gunn was intense. Some of the criticism focused not just on her performance but also on her appearance, including her choice of outfit—a green and yellow Australian Olympic tracksuit, which many commenters derided. The harshness of the comments was a stark reminder of the challenges athletes face in the digital age, where every action is subject to public scrutiny.In response to the online abuse, Australia’s Chef de Mission, Anna Meares, publicly defended Gunn, condemning the trolling as disappointing and unnecessary. Meares praised Gunn for her courage and the enthusiasm she brought to the Olympic team, highlighting the broader context of the challenges faced by female athletes throughout history. She pointed out that Gunn’s inclusion in the Olympics was a significant achievement, earned through dedication and passion for her craft.Gunn herself responded to the criticism with resilience. On Instagram , she encouraged others not to be afraid to stand out and to embrace their individuality, no matter the cost. She reflected on her journey, acknowledging that she was always the underdog in the competition and that her goal was to bring something different to the stage. Her approach to breaking was rooted in a desire to be artistic and creative, rather than conforming to the conventional expectations of what an Olympic sport should look like.","Rachael Gunn, 36, represented Australia at the 2024 Paris Olympics.

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha.

Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal. The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

"Apple, Google agreed to ‘defend’ search deal from regulators",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/apple-google-agreed-to-defend-search-deal-from-regulators/articleshow/103974460.cms,"Apple Inc.’s lucrative agreement to use Alphabet Inc.’s Google as the default search engine for the iPhone includes a provision that the two tech giants will “support and defend” the deal against government scrutiny, a top Apple executive said at an antitrust trial.Their longtime contract was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Services Eddy Cue disclosed Tuesday in a Washington federal court, where the US government is pressing its claim that Google operates a monopoly in the search business.Cue, the architect of the most recent version of the agreement, said the provision for a joint defense was added at Google’s request. He said it was handled by company lawyers so he couldn’t speak directly to why it was included. Around that time, the European Union was investigating Google’s dominance in online search.During his testimony, the executive defended Apple’s arrangement with its tech rival, saying it was the best choice for customers to have Google as the default search engine.“There certainly wasn’t a valid alternative we would have gone to at the time,” Cue said. “I don’t know what we would have done” if the deal had collapsed, he said.Google first became the default option in the Safari browser in 2002. That deal has been revised several times. Cue said the contract was extended in 2021, after the Justice Department filed its initial case against Google’s search dominance the year before.Google pays Apple billions of dollars for this prominent position on products like the iPhone, making the agreement of particular interest to the government. The question before the judge in the antitrust trial is whether the search giant pushed its way onto Apple devices at the expense of competitors.In his testimony, Cue stressed that Apple sees no need to develop its own search tool because Google clearly is the best option. That differs from the company’s approach in other areas: It competes with Google in mapping software and voice assistants, as well as operating systems for phones and computers.The Justice Department displayed an email from 2016 in which Cue told Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook that Google CEO Sundar Pichai was not agreeing to Apple’s proposed revenue share. When the Justice Department’s attorney asked Cue whether Apple would have walked away from the negotiation, Cue said he didn’t seriously consider it, but Apple might have created its own search engine.Part of Cue’s testimony Tuesday was closed to the public because it involved internal company information that Apple and Google want to keep secret.Cue was expected to testify behind closed doors about Apple’s search arrangements with other companies, which provide the non-default options built into the Safari internet browser, according to a person familiar with the planned testimony. That includes Microsoft Corp.’s Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo and Ecosia. Similar to its agreement with Google, Apple gets a slice of the advertising revenue generated when users select those search engines as their main option in Safari.Last week, Apple machine learning chief John Giannandrea testified as well. The executive, who led search at Google before joining Apple in 2018, pointed to a new feature in iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 — the latest software that runs iPhones and iPads — that lets users assign a different default search engine for private browsing.That means Apple users can switch between Google and another option more easily, according to Cue. “We like our products to come out of the box and work where it feels like magic,” he said. However, Apple doesn’t track how many customers actually make the change to a non-Google search engine, because of privacy concerns, Cue said.The case is US v. Google, 20-cv-3010, US District Court, District of Columbia.",Apple’s longtime contract with Google was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision.

Apple iPhone SE (rumoured name iPhone SE 4 ) is reported to be the next ‘affordable’ iPhone. While the Cupertino-based tech company is set to bring the iPhone 16 series in September, iPhone SE (fourth gen) may launch early next year, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman has claimed.Gurman says that iPhone 16 may not bring ‘meaningful bumps’ for those using the latest models, but people with older models will see ‘nice upgrades’ in the series.He shares that there will be a similar story with those using the current generation iPhone SE.“..next year is certain to bring a bigger shake-up to the iPhone line. As early as the beginning of 2025, Apple will launch a new iPhone SE — the first upgrade to its low-end phone since 2022,” Gurman said in his weekly Power On newsletter.Gurman says that not only will the phone launch in early 2025, it will have a major design change and look like an iPhone 14 “with a crisper OLED display that stretches across the full device.” Previous reports claimed the phone will have FacelD, notch and its screen may measure 6.1 inches – up from 4.7 inches.Rumours also say that Apple is planning to keep the backplate manufacturing process for the rumoured iPhone SE 4 'exactly the same' as the standard model in Apple's upcoming iPhone 16 lineup. When it comes to features, people may expect that iPhone SE 4 will haveApple Intelligence – a suite of artificial intelligence features that Apple announced at WWDC this year.As far as the price is concerned, there is no concrete information but reports suggest a sub-$500 (approximately Rs 42,000) price tag.“If Apple can get the price of the new iPhone SE down to around $500, I think it could be a hot seller,” Gurman noted.","Apple iPhone SE (rumoured name iPhone SE 4 ) is reported to be the next ‘affordable’ iPhone.

How this 'China ban' may be behind e-SIMs not becoming 'popular' in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-this-china-ban-may-be-behind-e-sims-not-becoming-popular-in-india/articleshow/112449382.cms,"When Airtel CEO 'batted' for e-SIMs

The adoption rate of virtual SIMs or eSIMs in India has been rather slow -- for both retail and enterprise users -- despite the advantages they offer. According to industry experts, this is primarily attributed to a Chinese government policy that has discouraged its use. The three biggest telecom operators in India -- Airtel, Reliance Jio and Vodafone-Idea -- have supported e-SIM features almost for years now.Apple launched the first e-SIM-enabled phones in 2018. The iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max and iPhone XR were the first phones to support e-SIM and since then all iPhone have supported e-SIM features. Google's Pixel phones too support the e-Sim feature from 2019.While top-tier smartphone brands like Google, Apple and Samsung offer eSIM support in almost all their premium models, the adoption of the same in smartphones from Chinese companies like Xiaomi , Vivo , Oppo , OnePlus and Realme has been almost negligible. This is same for their high-end, medium as well as low-end models. Across the portfolio, these brands have been notably slow in adoption of e-SIMs.Here according to a report in Economic Times, a big reason is that there's a reluctance to extend this feature to affordable smartphones among Chinese smartphone brands. This is because China, a crucial market and the home country of these brands, has strict regulations on e-SIMs due to security concerns. It is not clear if there is an explicit ban, but even Apple, which is the first company to support e-SIMs, does not sell iPhones with e-SIMs in China mainland.Consequently, manufacturers are hesitant to incur additional costs for eSIM compatibility in devices meant for the Indian market, where cost-effectiveness is a major factor.Telcos, on the other hand, are keen on promoting eSIM adoption in the affordable segment as it can lead to cost reductions. Also, call quality is widely regarded to be better in phones with e-SIM. Earlier this year, citing the benefits of using virtual SIMs, Gopal Vittal, CEO, Airtel, had urged the telco’s large user base to shift from physical eSIMs saying, “In these times of digital-first lifestyles, where mobiles, tablets and watches are all interconnected, the e-SIM will provide seamless connectivity for you.”“For instance, you will be able to go for a morning jog and not carry your phone along since the e-SIM will enable connectivity on your smartwatch while your phone sits by your bedside at home and you enjoy your run,” Vittal wrote to the subscribers.However, as of December 2023, only about 10-15% of smartphones sold in India supported eSIMs, with Counterpoint Research predicting a gradual increase to 20% over the next five years. This is in stark contrast to the US, where eSIM penetration has reached 70%. In fact, the iPhone 15 series models launched in the US do not support physical SIM.Industry experts believe that as costs associated with eSIM technology decrease and the supply chain matures, more smartphone manufacturers will be inclined to adopt eSIMs in their affordable models. This shift would bring several benefits to both telcos and consumers, including cost savings, enhanced security, and greater flexibility.While the potential of eSIMs is undeniable, the road to widespread adoption in India is likely to be gradual, influenced by factors such as government policies, consumer awareness, and technological advancements.","The adoption rate of virtual SIMs or eSIMs in India has been rather slow.

The company's message to attendees, according to a spokesperson, was one of gratitude and appreciation for the community.Sentonas' acceptance speech, shared widely online, was met with surprising enthusiasm.

The award itself was a last-minute addition, a humorous acknowledgment of the company's recent blunder.Accepting the comically large trophy, Sentonas admitted the error but emphasized the company’s commitment to learning from its mistakes. He pledged to display the award prominently at CrowdStrike headquarters as a constant reminder of the importance of protecting users.The company's public response has been seen as a bold strategy to rebuild trust and transparency.

California man credits Apple Watch for saving his life: ‘I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for this little device’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/california-man-credits-apple-watch-for-saving-his-life-i-wouldnt-be-here-if-it-wasnt-for-this-little-device/articleshow/112306053.cms,"Apple Watch detects user’s low heart rate



What doctor said

An Apple Watch user is crediting the smartwatch for saving his life after the wearable alerted him about a life-threatening condition. Peter Moore , a resident of Montecito, California shared his experience with a local news publisher KTLA. Narrating the incident, he said “I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for this little device”.Moore, who is a former tech executive, said that he was on his way to the airport when he began to feel “a little lightheaded and a little faint”.“Like a typical male, I thought, ‘I’ll go to Starbucks. That’ll fix it,'” Moore explained before he received a notification from the Apple Watch he was wearing.“My phone started to ping and said ‘low heart rate,’ which I’d never seen before. And so I looked at it… my heart rate had dropped to 32. And it was insistent in its notifications that something wasn’t right,” said Moore. He then contacted his wife who took him to hospital.“The doctor kind of theatrically ran in and said, ‘This is not good. This is not good. You need a pacemaker right now,'” Moore said.Omid Yousefian, the cardiac electrophysiologist at Sansum Clinic Cardiology who treated Moore said “Yes, his watch had a big role in saving his life”.“These days, 25% of the population over the age of 40 … have a high chance of experiencing atrial fibrillation,” Yousefian explained.“For us physicians, symptoms are the most important thing. [Moore] was notified by his watch that his heart rate is slow and he correlated that with the symptoms that he had. So he didn’t wait. He didn’t sit. He came to the hospital directly. So he made a very smart move,” Yousefian told the publication.","Peter Moore, a former tech executive, was on his way to the airport when he began to feel “a little lightheaded and a little faint” He received a notification from the Apple Watch he was wearing that his heart rate had dropped to 32.

Google Lens , the image recognition tool, is reportedly getting a significant upgrade with the addition of voice search . According to Android Authority, this new feature allows users to add context to their searches by speaking directly into the app while capturing an image.Previously, users could only add context after taking a picture.

What exactly happened

Read the complete post here

In a shocking incident, a Supreme Court lawyer, Mukul P Unny , was scammed out of Rs 38,000 while attempting to exchange his iPhone 13 for an iPhone 15 on Amazon .in. The lawyer detailed his ordeal on social media, highlighting the fraudulent tactics employed by the delivery executive.Unny took X (formerly known as Twitter) to post about the new kind of smartphone exchange scam.The incident occurred on July 21, 2024, when Unny placed an order for the iPhone 15 on Amazon. The following day, a delivery executive arrived at his residence and handed over the new phone after receiving the necessary OTP. However, the executive then requested another OTP, claiming it was required to complete the exchange.Despite Unny's hesitation, he was convinced to return the new iPhone to the delivery executive after speaking to the latter's supervisor.Unny contacted Amazon customer care the following day to report the incident. Initially, Amazon assured him of a refund if the product was not delivered. However, subsequent inquiries revealed the case was under investigation with a resolution deadline of July 31.On July 31st, Amazon concluded its investigation and informed Unny that a refund was impossible. The company's explanation lacked substance, as they had not thoroughly verified the scam details. The fact that Unny still possessed his old iPhone directly contradicted Amazon's claim that the exchange was complete.While Amazon has eventually issued a refund to Unny, his ordeal underscores the considerable risks inherent in online transactions, even when dealing with reputable platforms like Amazon.Always verify the identity of a delivery executive before sharing your Amazon OTP. This crucial step can protect you from falling victim to scams.“This is the story of my worst experience with @amazonIN On 21.07.2024, I ordered iPhone 15 from Amazon in exchange for my iPhone 13. On 22.07.2024, the delivery executive came at around 930 PM. I gave the OTP and took the product, and gave my phone to the executive.He said I have give another OTP. I had already given the OTP and was wondering what other OTP is to be given for exchange. I said I dont have any other OTP than the one I have given. He stayed there for few minutes & then called his supervisor.After speaking with the supervisor, the delivery exec asked for return of the product since the ""exchange is not final"".I insisted that I speak with the supervisor. The supervisor tells me that the exchange is done by a different team & requests for the product to be returned. I said I cannot give away the product especially since the OTP is given and the app was showing that the product is delivered. But this supervisor Ashok (8076650306) requested me to return, lest his team will have to make for the loss.Upon his request and assurance that the product will be ""reattempted"" the next day, I gave the product to the delivery exec (Vishal 8826421956) after taking the supervisor's and the delivery exec's number. On 23.07.2024, I spoke with the Amazon Customer Care and raised a complaint to which I assured that refund will be initiated if the product is not delivered. Call centre asked me to follow up on 25.07.2024.On 26.07.2024,when I called them, the customer case asked me to wait till 31.05.2024 as ""it has to be investigated"". Today, when I call Amazon, they said ""investigation"" is complete and that refund cannot be initiated. No fact-finding was done by Amazon in this. Now, we are staring at a loss of Rs. 38000 and a possible scam done by supervisor, delivery exec and others at Amazon. If they say that the exchange is done, then they can very well see the old phone that I still use with me.This could happen to any one of you and please be aware while dealing with @amazonIN.”","Supreme Court lawyer Mukul P Unny was scammed out of Rs 38,000 while attempting to exchange his iPhone 13 for an iPhone 15 on Amazon.in.

The American Nightmare’s Return to Wrestling

Roman Reigns and Cody Rhodes have an intense moment #summerslam

""Everyone keeps asking me how I feel about coming back to WWE, if I'm really excited. The response I keep giving is that it’s just a really heavy feeling. I grew up in the WWE system with the dream of reaching the top. But as Garth Brooks sings, 'dreams are like rivers,' and mine took a different path. Now, to have the opportunity to revisit that original goal when I thought it was out of reach is just a profound, heavy experience.""

Throughout his career,has been known for adopting various nicknames, especially during his two different tenures in WWE. Early on, Rhodes was recognized as ""Dashing"" Cody Rhodes, a persona that highlighted his good looks and confidence. But after getting a facial injury that necessitated the use of a mask, he changed his identity to become ""Undashing"" Cody Rhodes, adopting a more sinister and troubled persona.The most notable and influential moniker Rhodes has worn, though, especially throughout his prosperous tenures in AEW and WWE, where he now holds the title of Undisputed WWE Universal Champion, is ""."" This is a witty reinterpretation of his father Dusty Rhodes ' well-known namesake, ""The American Dream.""Rhodes discussed the history of the moniker """" in an interview with GQ Sports, providing insight into how it came to be. The moniker, according to Rhodes, was given to him when he was a member of the notorious Bullet Club while he was still with New Japan Pro Wrestling.Rhodes said.Interestingly, Rhodes didn't mention that the ""American Nightmare"" persona wasn’t entirely original within his family. Before Cody, his older brother Dustin Rhodes had already used the moniker. Dustin adopted the ""American Nightmare"" name upon his return to WCW in 1999, after initially coming back under the gimmick ""Seven,"" which he quickly dropped. As ""The American Nightmare,"" Dustin feuded with notable wrestlers like Jeff Jarrett and Terry Funk before eventually disappearing from television. When he returned in 2001, Dustin decided to leave the ""American Nightmare"" nickname behind. Cody Rhodes has since taken the nickname to new heights, making it his own and solidifying it as an integral part of his wrestling identity.With a lot of buzz surrounding his next move, professional wrestler Cody Rhodes emerged as the most sought-after free agent in 2022. Even with all of the talk about where he would end up, a lot of indications suggested he will return to WWE, the organisation where he initially gained notoriety.In April, Rhodes made his eagerly awaited comeback at WrestleMania 38, entering the arena as Seth Rollins ' unexpected rival. The stadium erupted in cheers as Rhodes prevailed in a match that would live in memory. Reflecting on his return, Rhodes shared with Variety,","Cody Rhodes has been known for adopting various nicknames, especially during his two different tenures in WWE.

The SmackDown episode following SummerSlam was outstanding, featuring high octane matches and thrilling segments. The highlight of the night was the appearance of The Original Tribal Chief , Roman Reigns. Despite his ongoing war against The Bloodline members, Roman made his intentions clear on SmackDown. Solo Sikoa provoked Reigns by suggesting that if Roman wanted to remain The Tribal Chief, he would have to reclaim the Ula Fala Samoan necklace from him.Solo even dared to challenge Roman Reigns , a move that seemed more like a death wish. Given Roman's actions against the Bloodline members, Solo might be left traumatized for a while.After his electrifying return at SummerSlam, Roman Reigns made a thunderous appearance on SmackDown. Solo Sikoa, claiming the title of Tribal Chief for himself, challenged Roman, declaring that if Roman wanted the Ula Fla necklace back, he would have to face him. As Reigns' music hit, he emerged, but it was clear he wasn’t in the mood for greeting his cousins. Instead, Roman unleashed his wrath on the Bloodline members, Tama Tonga and Tanga Loa.Reigns attacked both Loa and Tonga with the ring steps before locking eyes with Sikoa, who removed his jacket, ready for a fight. Roman stepped into the ring, delivering a flurry of right hands to Sikoa, followed by a Superman Punch. He prepared to finish it off with a spear, but before he could, Tonga and Loa pulled Sikoa out of the ring. Roman spotted Sikoa’s necklace and picked it up, but was blindsided by Tonga and Loa, who handed the necklace back to Sikoa.Roman then struck Tanga Loa with a Superman Punch, followed by a vicious spear. He then speared Tama Tonga through the barricade near the timekeeper's area. Seizing a chair, Reigns repeatedly struck Loa across the spine, while Sikoa placed his necklace across his chest, watching as Reigns continued his assault. The crowd erupted in cheers for Roman as the show went off the air in electrifying fashion.Following the latest episode of SmackDown, it appears fans might witness a showdown between Solo Sikoa and Roman Reigns at Bash in Berlin . There's also speculation that the match could feature a special stipulation involving the Tribal Chief's position. If this confrontation takes place, it could become a historic moment, with fans eagerly anticipating a battle between the cousin brothers.","Roman Reigns made a thunderous appearance on SmackDown.
