Gracie Hunt, the Kansas City Chiefs heiress, recently shared an experience that made her rethink how she approaches her health and self-care. During a visit to Medici Health in Austin, she underwent a comprehensive wellness assessment that went far beyond routine checkups, prompting reflections on the importance of taking care of the whole body before any issues arise. The visit highlighted how modern, holistic healthcare can be both enlightening and empowering, even for someone accustomed to high-profile lifestyles.Gracie described her visit as ‚Äúeye-opening,‚Äù emphasizing how the assessment covered everything from heart screenings and bloodwork to vision and hearing tests. ‚ÄúIt really reminded me how important it is to take care of our whole selves, not just to wait until something feels wrong,‚Äù she shared. Her experience underscores a growing awareness among individuals that true wellness is about more than just addressing immediate problems‚Äîit‚Äôs about understanding your body inside and out before issues arise.What set Gracie‚Äôs visit apart, she said, was the compassion and attentiveness of the team. ‚ÄúThe team made it such a thoughtful and encouraging experience,‚Äù she reflected, pointing to Dr. Vo and the staff who ensured every step of the process was comfortable, informative, and reassuring.Their approach transforms what might normally feel clinical into a personalized journey, emphasizing both physical health and emotional confidence.Gracie also highlighted the vision behind Medici Health, praising the Phillips family for their dedication to holistic wellness. ‚ÄúThe Phillips family behind Medici has the biggest heart for transforming lives from the inside out, and so many of us are truly blessed by you,‚Äù she said. Their mission demonstrates how modern healthcare can combine innovation with empathy, creating a model that inspires patients to be proactive about their health.The post drew an immediate response from her mother, Tavia Hunt, who commented, ‚ÄúAn incredibly impressive and thorough healthcare experience!!üôåüèºüíØ‚Äù This interaction highlights the role family support plays in encouraging personal wellness. Health journeys become more meaningful when shared and celebrated, reinforcing positive behaviors across generations.Gracie Hunt‚Äôs reflections offer a powerful lesson: wellness is a continuous, proactive journey. Her eye-opening experience at Medici Health reminds readers that holistic assessments, compassionate care, and forward-thinking healthcare innovation can make a profound difference. It‚Äôs a call to view health not as something to monitor only when problems arise but as a dynamic, ongoing practice that benefits both body, and mind. And in Gracie's words and actions, it's clear that prioritizing wellness isn't just a lifestyle choice-it's a lifelong commitment to truly living well. Her journey stands as a gentle reminder that investing in our health today is the most meaningful gift we can give our future selves. Because sometimes, the most powerful transformations begin not on the outside- but within. And it shows that even small steps toward self-care can spark life-changing realizations.Also read: Fans can't get enough of Peter, Kirk Herbstreit‚Äôs adorable golden retriever, who stole smiles and hearts at Rams vs. 49ers","Gracie Hunt, the Kansas City Chiefs heiress, recently shared an experience that made her rethink how she approaches her health and self-care.

At just 30 years old, Lucy Guo has joined the ranks of billionaire college dropouts like Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, amassing a $1.25 billion net worth, according to Forbes. Guo‚Äôs meteoric rise came after her first company, Scale AI, was acquired by Meta in a deal valuing the AI data labeling firm at $29 billion, CNBC reported. Guo, now the founder of Passes, a content creator monetization platform launched in 2022, shared with 'CNBC Make It' that she veered from the traditional path of higher education. After studying computer science and human-computer interaction at Carnegie Mellon University, Guo left the program just two years in, with only one year and eight classes left to graduate. The decision stunned her Chinese immigrant parents.‚ÄúThey sacrificed everything to immigrate from China to America to give their kids a better future,‚Äù Guo told CNBC Make It. ‚ÄúFor their kids to suddenly let go of their education when they were almost done was like a slap in the face.‚Äù ‚ÄúI think they [parents] viewed that as a sign that I didn‚Äôt love them, and they weren‚Äôt very happy with it, when it was just me making a bet on myself and choosing to optimize for what I thought would be a better future for myself,‚Äù she said.Instead of finishing her degree, Guo pursued the Thiel Fellowship, a program by PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel that awards $200,000 to young entrepreneurs to build innovative companies. ‚ÄúI think [my parents] viewed that as a sign that I didn‚Äôt love them,‚Äù Guo said. ‚ÄúIt was just me making a bet on myself and choosing to optimize for what I thought would be a better future.‚Äù Despite her unconventional path, Guo sees value in college for its networking opportunities.‚ÄúOne to two years in college is actually just incredibly great because you‚Äôre going to make the best friends in college, and you‚Äôre going to meet the smartest people,‚Äù she told CNBC Make It. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no other scenario where there‚Äôs such a high concentration of smart people who are also looking to make friends.‚ÄùGuo noted that unlike workplaces or social events, where people may already have established circles, college offers a unique environment for building lifelong connections. Her story underscores a growing trend of entrepreneurs prioritizing real-world experience over traditional education, while still recognizing the social benefits of a campus environment.","Lucy Guo is the founder of Passes, a content creator monetization platform.

Apple CEO Tim Cook paid a heartfelt tribute to Steve Jobs on his death anniversary. Sharing a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), Cook wrote: ‚ÄúSteve saw the future as a bright and boundless place, lit the path forward, and inspired us to follow. We miss you, my friend.‚Äù For those unaware, Jobs died on October 5, 2011 after 8 eight years of battling pancreatic cancer. Tim Cook‚Äôs post caught the attention of Tesla CEO Elon Musk who reposted it on his timeline.Steve Jobs co-founded Apple in 1976 alongside Steve Wozniak. During his leadership, Apple launched groundbreaking products like the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, reshaping entire industries and redefining the way people communicate, work, and consume entertainment.Renowned for his focus on design and user experience, Jobs was instrumental in making technology simpler and more accessible. His vision not only revived Apple from the brink of collapse but also propelled it into becoming one of the most valuable and influential companies in the world.When Steve Jobs was battling severe health issues in the late 2000s, Apple‚Äôs then‚ÄìChief Operating Officer Tim Cook made a deeply personal gesture.Cook offered to donate a part of his liver to Jobs, since both shared the same rare blood type.According to accounts later revealed in Tim Cook‚Äôs biography and media reports, the Apple executive underwent extensive medical testing and found that he was indeed a suitable donor. However, Jobs firmly declined the offer.Cook recalled that Jobs became emotional but quickly dismissed the idea, telling him: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never let you do that. I‚Äôll never do that.‚Äù Jobs, who was known for his uncompromising principles and independent spirit, made it clear he would not accept such a sacrifice from a colleague and friend.This episode highlighted both Cook‚Äôs deep loyalty to Jobs and the unique bond the two shared during Apple‚Äôs most transformative years. While Jobs continued to struggle with his health, he refused to let anyone else bear the risks of a major procedure on his behalf.Jobs eventually underwent a liver transplant in 2009, performed by a medical team in Tennessee, but not with Cook as a donor. He returned to lead Apple after the surgery, but his health continued to decline until his passing in October 2011.","Apple CEO Tim Cook paid a heartfelt tribute to Steve Jobs on his death anniversary.

Full text of Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu‚Äôs post

Arattai is on the surface a simple product but it has a lot of depth inside.

Let me list the engineering frameworks (all homegrown) that power Arattai.

First is what we call our messaging/AV framework. This has been the ""real time"" workhorse of Zoho for a while and this is what offers you those crisp calls and meetings that connect quickly. It has been perfected for 15 years.

Then we have a distributed framework that allows us to distribute the workload among many servers and databases, and provides fault tolerance, performance monitoring, security and so on. This is the backbone of Zoho and powers a lot of what you see on the surface and also keeps our systems secure. We have been perfecting this for over 20 years now!

We have teams actively working on these frameworks and they provide strong support to the Arattai team.

Our staying power comes from the depth of all the R&D we do. Recently I have moved full time to R&D and you will see many more innovations from us.

‚Äúthe more connected and accessible you are, the less productive you are.‚Äù





Telegram CEO Pavel Durov begins his day without checking his phone. This is because he views the device as a distraction that can prevent people from forming their own ideas. On a recent episode of the Lex Fridman podcast, Durov said he tries to limit his phone usage, explaining that he doesn't want other people telling him what to think. Durov's discipline regarding his phone is part of a broader routine aimed at maximising mental clarity. He revealed that he allocates 11 to 12 hours for sleep, often spending part of that time with his mind racing, as he finds that brilliant ideas come to him during these extended rest periods. Fridman, the podcast host, also noted that he spent two weeks with Durov and never saw him use his phone for social media as most people do.In the podcast, Durov said:However, Durov acknowledged the need to stay connected while maintaining balance, as his career has been built on apps that promote smartphone use. He noted:Durov has also been vocal about his views on technology and data privacy.In August, he said he‚Äôd ‚Äúrather die‚Äù than give third parties access to Telegram messages.He has become a central figure in the ongoing tension between social media platforms and governments.

As 2025 draws to a close, residents of the UAE have an extraordinary celestial lineup to look forward to. From the giant Harvest Moon dramatically lighting up October skies alongside Saturn and Jupiter, to three consecutive supermoons and multiple dazzling meteor showers illuminating the night, the coming months promise a stunning and memorable display of natural cosmic events clearly visible without special telescopes.On October 7, the first of three year-end supermoons, the Harvest Moon‚Äîwill dazzle skywatchers across the UAE and worldwide. This full moon will coincide with the moon‚Äôs closest approach to Earth, making it appear up to 14% larger and 30% brighter than usual. The moon‚Äôs size seems especially impressive near the horizon, thanks to the ‚Äúmoon illusion,‚Äù where our eyes perceive it as bigger against familiar foreground objects like trees or buildings.The Harvest Moon, historically named for its role in aiding farmers to gather crops before winter, will rise just after sunset and remain visible in full form until October 9. Leading up to this, starting October 1, the waxing gibbous moon will draw closer to Saturn, creating a striking pairing in the southeastern evening sky. By October 5, observers will see the moon and Saturn rising side by side on the eastern horizon, just below the Summer Triangle formed by the stars Vega, Altair, and Deneb.Though Saturn‚Äôs actual diameter is 35 times larger than the moon‚Äôs, its immense distance‚Äîover a billion kilometers‚Äîmakes it appear only as a small golden point near the bright lunar disc. Jupiter will also be visible nearby, adding to one of the year‚Äôs most remarkable and easily observable astronomical displays, best seen away from city lights under clear, dark skies.The Harvest Moon on October 7 marks the start of a unique sequence for the UAE: three consecutive supermoons occurring over three months. These include:Each supermoon will be visible across the UAE wherever there is a clear horizon, offering residents a unique and accessible opportunity to witness these lunar phenomena.The cosmic calendar doesn‚Äôt end with supermoons.

The Zayed Charity Run arrives in Rio de Janeiro on October 5, 2025, marking the event‚Äôs first stop in South America and bringing thousands of runners together to race, celebrate and raise funds for local social causes.The Zayed Charity Run Rio 2025 is set to take place on Saturday, October 5, marking a major milestone as the first-ever edition in South America. Hosted along Rio de Janeiro‚Äôs iconic coastline, the event will blend fitness, culture, and philanthropy in one of the world‚Äôs most picturesque race settings. This year‚Äôs Rio chapter is the second global stop of the 2025‚Äì2026 Zayed Charity Run season, following the opening leg in Beijing earlier this year. It sets the stage for a global calendar that will move through several cities including Abu Dhabi, Cairo, Miami, and Budapest before concluding mid-2026.Organizers expect a mass turnout of participants, with thousands of runners from Brazil and abroad signing up for the event. Among them will be approximately 200 participants from the UAE, including community runners, students, and representatives from various humanitarian and cultural organisations.The Rio race will also welcome over 250 international delegations, making it a powerful symbol of global unity under the banner of sport and giving. Officials from both the UAE and Brazil have noted that the event not only celebrates fitness but also strengthens bilateral ties through community engagement and goodwill.The run will feature two main routes a 5km family-friendly course and a 10km competitive race. Both are designed to be inclusive and accessible, encouraging participation from all age groups and fitness levels.

Entertainment stations, cultural performances, and local volunteer groups are expected to add to the energy of the day.The Zayed Charity Run is one of the UAE‚Äôs most successful humanitarian sports initiatives, launched to honor the legacy of the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the Founding Father of the UAE. It reflects his vision of humanity, compassion, and community service through action not just words.The event began in Abu Dhabi in 2001 as a local race aimed at promoting health and social responsibility. Over the years, it evolved into an international movement that combines fitness, philanthropy, and diplomacy. Each edition raises funds for hospitals, medical research, and welfare programs in its host city all under the spirit of ‚Äúgiving without borders.‚Äù Unlike commercial races, the Zayed Charity Run‚Äôs core niche is humanitarian impact. Every stop donates its proceeds directly to local causes, from cancer treatment in Egypt to children‚Äôs hospitals in New York and now family welfare in Rio. The initiative has previously supported organisations such as the Sheikh Khalifa Medical City, Children‚Äôs Cancer Hospital in Cairo, and Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi.The goal is simple yet powerful: ""Use running as a bridge between nations and people, promoting health and kindness through collective action""Beyond the race itself, the Rio event is explicitly charitable: proceeds will support local organizations that help vulnerable children, women and families including partnerships with community groups such as Rio Solidario. The National and other coverage note that funds raised at the Rio stop will be channelled into programmes on education, social support and child welfare in the host city. That local focus is central to the Zayed Charity Run‚Äôs mission combining sport, culture and humanitarian aid.Participation in the Zayed Charity Run Rio 2025 is open to the public, with organizers encouraging people of all backgrounds to join from professional runners to families and first-time participants.

Sharjah Police have launched a hard-hitting awareness video warning drivers that even a few seconds of phone use behind the wheel can lead to tragic accidents, highlighting 267 crashes this year linked to distracted driving and urging everyone to ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Be The Next Number. ‚ÄùSharjah Police released a new awareness video on October 4, 2025, showing how a few seconds spent replying, scrolling or taking a photo behind the wheel can lead to irreversible tragedy.

In a recent advisory, Dubai Police have alerted the public about a significant increase in fraudulent advertisements circulating on social media platforms and various websites. These deceptive ads promise lucrative part-time job opportunities, preying on job seekers' aspirations.Authorities have issued a series of advisories across their official channels (including their X account and eCrime platform).

Error-free UPI transactions: NPCI bans nicknames in UPI payments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/banking/error-free-upi-transactions-npci-bans-nicknames-in-upi-payments-heres-how-it-will-benefit-users/articleshow/120721570.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a significant move to enhance user safety and transparency in digital transactions, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‚Äòultimate beneficiary name‚Äô, as recorded in the Core Banking System (CBS), during peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-merchant (P2PM) transactions.In a circular dated April 24, 2025, the NPCI issued an addendum to its earlier guidelines, mandating UPI apps to ensure that only the bank-registered name of the recipient is shown on the transaction confirmation screen and in the transaction history.The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.According to NPCI, the ""ultimate beneficiary"" is the person or entity receiving funds for services or goods provided. Going forward, names fetched directly from the Validate Address API ‚Äì the same used to retrieve official bank names, will be the only ones shown to payers. Names derived from QR codes, contact lists, or user-defined labels will no longer be permitted.‚ÄúThis change is being introduced to help customers verify they are sending money to the correct beneficiary and to reduce risks of misdirected payments,‚Äù NPCI stated in its communication to UPI ecosystem members.Many UPI apps currently allow users to modify payee display names or generate aliases, making it easier for fraudsters to impersonate trusted brands or individuals. Going forward, this loophole will be shut.NPCI has clearly instructed that apps must disable any feature that allows users to edit or customise beneficiary names within their interfaces.The circular comes amid growing concerns over rising UPI-based frauds, often caused by misleading display names that do not match official records. ‚ÄúThis step can drastically reduce accidental transfers and fraudulent transactions. Displaying only the bank-verified name adds a key layer of authentication,‚Äù said Rahul Jain, CFO at NTT DATA Payment Services India according to an ET report.The change will particularly impact small merchants who fall under the P2PM category, such as kirana store owners or street vendors, who often receive payments via QR codes embedded with non-official names. Once enforced, customers will be shown only the CBS-registered name, not the store‚Äôs brand name or any custom label.‚ÄúThis will bring much-needed clarity for users and reduce errors. It enhances trust and makes the payment ecosystem more secure,‚Äù said Atul Gupta, head of risk & compliance at Cashfree Payments.Despite some anticipated transition challenges for users accustomed to aliases or nicknames, experts believe the change is a step in the right direction. As Mukesh Chand, senior counsel at Economic Laws Practice, explained, ‚ÄúIt helps reduce anonymity and gives users more confidence before authorising a transaction.‚ÄùBy standardising the way beneficiary names are displayed, NPCI aims to make UPI payments safer, more transparent, and less prone to manipulation.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‚Äòultimate beneficiary name‚Äô The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here‚Äôs a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here‚Äôs what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Pensioners play a vital role in the social fabric of our society, and their financial security is paramount. To ensure continued access to pension benefits, annual life certificate submissions are mandatory for all pensioners. This process, which verifies the pensioner's living status, has been streamlined through various online and offline methods. With the recent initiatives to promote digital submissions, pensioners can conveniently fulfil this requirement and maintain their financial support.The requirement for pensioners to submit their jeevan pramaan patra is a critical process in ensuring the integrity and sustainability of pension funds. By providing multiple submission methods‚Äîboth online and offline‚Äîthe government is making it easier for pensioners to comply with this requirement. The ongoing digital campaigns further illustrate the government‚Äôs commitment to enhancing the efficiency and accessibility of pension services, ensuring that pensioners receive their benefits without unnecessary delays.The submission window for life certificates opened on November 1 for pensioners under the age of 80. This is part of an annual cycle during which pensioners must reaffirm their eligibility for pension disbursement. The deadline for submitting the life certificate is November 30. If the certificate is not submitted by this deadline, pension payments will be suspended starting in December. This requirement also applies to super senior citizens (aged 80 and above), who were allowed to submit their certificates starting on October 1, with the same November 30 deadline.Pensioners can submit their life certificates through several methods, accommodating various preferences and technological capabilities. Here are the options available:For those choosing to submit their life certificates online through the Jeevan Pramaan Portal, the following steps are involved:For pensioners opting for offline submission, the process is straightforward:If pensioners fail to submit their life certificates by the stipulated deadline, their pension payments will be halted starting the following month. However, payments will resume once the life certificate is submitted, thereby ensuring that pensioners do not permanently lose access to their funds, provided they complete the required process.In an effort to facilitate the submission process, the Department of Pension and Pensioners' Welfare (DoPPW) has initiated its third nationwide digital life certificate (DLC) campaign. This campaign runs from November 1 to November 30, covering 800 cities and districts. The campaign aims to promote the use of digital platforms for certificate submission, ensuring greater accessibility for pensioners.On the first day of this campaign, over 1.8 lakh pensioners successfully generated their digital life certificates, highlighting the growing adoption of technology among pensioners. This indicates a positive trend towards digitalization and the effective use of biometric authentication methods.A life certificate is an official document that verifies a pensioner's living status, required annually to continue receiving pension benefits.All pensioners, including family pensioners, must submit a life certificate to maintain their pension payments.Pensioners under 80 must submit their life certificate between November 1 and November 30 each year. Super senior citizens (80 and above) can submit theirs starting from October 1, with the same deadline.If the life certificate is not submitted by the deadline, pension payments will be suspended starting the following month.Pensioners can submit their life certificates online via the Jeevan Pramaan portal, through doorstep banking agents, using biometric devices at post offices, or in person at bank branches.Pensioners can submit their life certificates online by using the Jeevan Pramaan portal and completing biometric verification through designated apps.Yes, pensioners can submit their life certificates in person at their respective banks or post offices.Generally, you will need your Aadhaar number for biometric verification, along with any other identification or pension-related documents as required by your pension disbursing authority.Pensioners can check the status of their life certificate submission through the Jeevan Pramaan portal or by contacting their bank or pension disbursing authority.Yes, if your submission fails, you can reapply and submit your life certificate again using the same methods available to you.",Submission window for 'Jeevan Pramaan Patra' opens for pensioners under 80 with a deadline of November 30.

With mass shootings a constant fear for parents and school administrators almost across the US, several States have spent the last decade investing in surveillance systems to monitor students' online activity. A recent incident in Florida showed this technology. A school monitoring system flagged a student after he asked ChatGPT for advice on how to kill his friend.The event unfolded when a school-issued computer flagged a concerning query made to OpenAI's ChatGPT. According to local police, the unnamed student asked the AI tool ""how to kill my friend in the middle of class."" The question immediately triggered an alert through the school's online surveillance system, which is operated by a company called Gaggle.According to a report in local NBC-affiliate WFLA, Volusia County Sheriff‚Äôs deputies responded to the school and interviewed the student. The teen reportedly told officers he was ""just trolling"" a friend who had annoyed him. However, law enforcement officials were not amused by the explanation. ""Another ‚Äòjoke‚Äô that created an emergency on campus,"" the Volusia County Sheriff‚Äôs Office stated, urging parents to talk to their children about the consequences of such actions.The student was subsequently arrested and booked at a county jail, although the specific charges have not been publicly disclosed.This incident is said to be the latest example of a school district's increasing reliance on surveillance technology to monitor students' digital activity in the wake of rising mass shootings. Gaggle, which provides safety services to school districts nationwide, describes its system as a tool for flagging ""concerning behavior tied to self-harm, violence, bullying, and more."" The company‚Äôs website indicates that its monitoring software filters for keywords and gains ""visibility into browser use, including conversations with AI tools such as Google Gemini, ChatGPT, and other platforms. ""This event comes as chatbots and other AI tools are increasingly appearing in criminal cases, often in relation to mental health. The rise of ""AI psychosis,"" where individuals with mental health issues have their delusions exacerbated by interactions with chatbots, has become a growing concern, with some recent suicides also being linked to the technology.","A Florida student was arrested after he asked an AI tool for advice on how to kill his friend.

I grow little of the food I eat, and of the little I do grow I did not breed or perfect the seeds.

I do not make any of my own clothing. I speak a language I did not invent or refine. I did not discover the mathematics I use. I am protected by freedoms and laws I did not conceive of or legislate, and do not enforce or adjudicate.

I am moved by music I did not create myself. When I needed medical attention, I was helpless to help myself survive. I did not invent the transistor, the microprocessor, object oriented programming, or most of the technology I work with.I love and admire my species, living and dead, and am totally dependent on them for my life and well being.

Microsoft discovers critical security flaw in software that prevents creation of deadly toxins or pathogens,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-discovers-critical-security-flaw-in-software-that-prevents-creation-of-deadly-toxins-or-pathogens/articleshow/124341632.cms,"Representative Image

Science,

Microsoft warns how this flaw can be misused



The patch is incomplete, and the state of the art is changing.

But this isn‚Äôt a one-and-done thing. It‚Äôs the start of even more testing. We‚Äôre in something of an arms race.‚Äù





A team of Microsoft researchers have used artificial intelligence (AI) to discover a ""zero-day"" vulnerability in the biosecurity screening software. This software is designed to prevent the misuse of DNA to create deadly toxins or pathogens. The discovery, which was led by Microsoft‚Äôs chief scientist, Eric Horvitz, shows how AI can bypass existing protections in a way previously unknown to biosecurity defenders. The findings, published in the journalstated that the researchers focused on generative AI algorithms, the same types of programs that fuel drug discovery at major startups. This software has ""dual-use"" potential to generate both beneficial and harmful molecules. Microsoft initiated a ""red-teaming"" test in 2023 to assess whether ""adversarial AI protein design"" could aid bioterrorists in manufacturing hazardous proteins.To execute the attack, Microsoft used several generative protein models, including its own EvoDiff, to subtly redesign known toxins. This manipulation was predicted to preserve the deadly function while allowing the DNA sequence to bypass the biosecurity screening software used by commercial vendors.Microsoft confirmed that the exercise was entirely digital and that no toxic proteins were ever produced. Before publishing the results, the company alerted the US government and software makers, who have since patched their systems.However, the fix is not complete. Adam Clore, director of technology R&D at Integrated DNA Technologies and a coauthor on the report, warned that some AI-designed molecules can still escape detection, stating,In a statement, Adam Clore, director of technology R&D at Integrated DNA Technologies, a large manufacturer of DNA, who is also a coauthor on the Microsoft report, said: ‚ÄúTo prevent misuse of the research, Microsoft did not disclose some of its code or reveal which toxic proteins (such as ricin or infectious prions) the AI was tasked with redesigning. However, some experts doubt that focusing solely on commercial DNA synthesis is the best defence.","Microsoft researchers have used artificial intelligence (AI) to discover a ""zero-day"" vulnerability in the biosecurity screening software.

Growing concerns over privacy and mission creep





US Immigration and Customs Enforcement is moving forward with plans to establish a round-the-clock social media surveillance operation, hiring nearly 30 private contractors to monitor platforms including Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, X, YouTube, and Reddit for deportation leads, according to federal contracting documents reviewed by Wired.The surveillance program would operate from two ICE targeting centers‚Äîthe National Criminal Analysis and Targeting Center in Williston, Vermont, and the Pacific Enforcement Response Center in Santa Ana, California. Vermont would employ 12 contractors while California would host 16 staff members working in shifts to ensure 24/7 coverage.Contractors would face strict deadlines for processing cases, Wired reported. Urgent matters involving national security threats or individuals on ICE's Most Wanted list must be researched within 30 minutes, while high-priority cases require completion within one hour. The agency expects contractors to meet these deadlines in at least 75 percent of cases.The program would also incorporate artificial intelligence and provide analysts with commercial databases like LexisNexis Accurint and Thomson Reuters CLEAR, which compile property records, phone bills, and vehicle registrations into searchable profiles.ICE has allocated over $1 million annually for surveillance software subscriptions.Privacy advocates warn the surveillance could extend beyond immigration enforcement. The Electronic Privacy Information Center has sued ICE over its use of data brokers, calling it a ""significant threat to privacy and liberty."" The American Civil Liberties Union argues such bulk data purchases help ICE circumvent warrant requirements.This initiative follows other controversial ICE surveillance contracts, including a $2 million deal with Israeli spyware company Paragon and agreements with facial recognition firm Clearview AI. The agency's main database, built by Palantir Technologies, already uses algorithmic analysis to generate enforcement leads.ICE defends the program by stating that ""previous approaches which have not incorporated open web sources and social media information have had limited success."" The agency did not respond to Wired's request for comment.

Tim Cook won‚Äôt be the only one to retire, some other executives too may leave





Apple CEO Tim Cook may step down from his leadership role in the near future, with hardware engineering chief John Ternus positioned as the leading candidate to replace him, according to Mark Gurman's Power On newsletter for Bloomberg.Cook, who turns 65 next month, no longer has a clear second-in-command following Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams' departure earlier this year. Williams, once viewed as Cook's heir apparent, relinquished his operations duties in July and is preparing to exit the company.Ternus, 50, has emerged as the frontrunner for CEO‚Äîthe same age Cook was when he assumed the role in 2011.
