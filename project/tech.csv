"'Nebraska Walz’s for Trump' shirts spark apostrophe debate on X, social media explodes over grammar fail",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nebraska-walzs-for-trump-shirts-spark-apostrophe-debate-on-x-social-media-explodes-over-grammar-fail/articleshow/113080143.cms,"In a viral moment that has X in stitches, a family photo featuring pro-Trump shirts worn by distant family members of Kamala's running mate Tim Walz , has sparked a wave of confusion and laughter, all thanks to one tiny punctuation mark — the apostrophe . The shirts, emblazoned with ' Nebraska Walz ’s for Trump ,' quickly grabbed attention online, not only for their political message but also for their puzzling use of grammar .The image, showing eight smiling members of the Walz family standing in front of a 'Trump 2024: Take America Back' banner, was posted on social media by prominent conservatives, including Donald Trump Jr and former President Trump himself. But what really set the internet ablaze wasn’t the familial endorsement—it was the oddly placed apostrophe in 'Walz’s,' which turned what should have been a simple plural into a possessive head-scratcher.Critics and grammar enthusiasts wasted no time weighing in. Keith Olbermann led the charge, posting, ""So these are the morons who can't use apostrophes correctly? No wonder they support Trump,"" sparking a flurry of similar comments.Twitter users were quick to join the grammar police, with one tweet reading, ""Politics aside, they don’t know how to use apostrophes. Exhibit A, the Walz’s. [Makes me shudder just to type it.]"" Another chimed in: ""How fitting that they don’t understand correct apostrophe usage. No wonder they’re voting for Trump.""Some couldn't resist poking fun at the broader implications, with one user sarcastically writing, “Too bad they are so uneducated they don't know the proper use of an apostrophe. Guess spelling isn't a priority in MAGA land.” Others kept it simple: “Morons don’t even know how to use an apostrophe. How embarrassing.”Even grammar buffs jumped into the conversation, explaining the rules for pluralizing names ending in “z” or “s.” “They obviously don't know you don't make a plural by using an apostrophe and an 's.'” One user quipped, “They're teachers. And they don't know the proper use of apostrophes. NEVER use an apostrophe to form a plural.”The misplaced apostrophe quickly became a viral sensation, transforming a political moment into a grammatical cautionary tale. As one Twitter user put it: “I’m crying. You know they’re stupid from the way they misused the apostrophe.”Whether you’re Team Trump or not, one thing is clear: the internet loves a good apostrophe scandal.","The apostrophe in 'Walz's' turned what should have been a simple plural into a possessive head-scratcher.

Apple Event is round the corner. Almost time for new iPhones. Apple is set to announce the iPhone 16 series at its ""Glowtime"" event on September 9 . The word “Glowtime” here is said to refer to the glow effect that appears around the edges of the screen when Siri is activated in the latest developer betas of iOS 18. According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, “Glow” is also the internal name for Apple's OS for its laptops and PCs -- macOS Sequoia.Both iOS 18 and macOS Sequoia will likely release after the event with new iPhones.As before all Apple events, the social media is full of alleged Apple leaks -- including alleged renders, mock-up photos, likely price, colour options and more. These photos are from some of the most-popular and well-known tipsters on the internet.Apple will hold iPhone 16 event live and in person at Steve Jobs' Theatre in Apple Park, Cupertino, California, on September 9th.

New Camera Layout with a Pill-Shaped Camera Bump

Larger Sizes for the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max

Two New Buttons

New Colors

Apple's iPhone 16 launch is likely right around the corner. Apple has sent out invites for “Glowtime” event on Monday September 9. While speculations suggest that Apple fans may have to wait longer for that 'Slim iPhone', there are likely to be some physical design changes in iPhone 16 series . This includes larger screens on the iPhone 16 Pro devices, thinner bezels and new camera design.Other than these there will be lots inside including new chip, brighter display, camera technology and more. Here we talk about the likely design changes.One of the most noticeable design changes in the iPhone 16 series is reported to be the significantly reduced bezel size, especially on the Pro and Pro Max models. This reduction in bezels will maximize the display area, providing users with more screen real estate and a more modern, sleek look.The iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus may feature a vertical camera orientation, similar to the iPhone 12 and 12 mini. This change is likely to accommodate spatial video recording, which can be viewed on the Vision Pro. Apple shifted from a vertical arrangement to a diagonal one starting with the iPhone 13 models. The company then said that doing so made it possible to fit a larger module in the device. So, while the exact reasons for the change is unclear, it's possible that the new orientation allows for a larger camera sensor.The iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max are expected to have larger screens compared to iPhone 15 series models. While iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max models have 6.1 and 6.7 inch screens, the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max might be 6.2 or 6.3 inch and 6.8 or 6.9 inch, respectively.The iPhone 16 series will introduce two new buttons: A replacement for the Mute Switch and a completely new button. Also, the Action Button in iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max models is likely to be expanded to the standard iPhone 16 models. This button can perform various functions like activating the Flashlight, turning on the Camera, launching Shortcuts, and more.While there have been conflicting rumors about the color options for the iPhone 16 series, it seems that the final choices colours may include black, green, pink, blue, and white. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes the iPhone 16 may not have the purple and yellow colour options.","Apple has sent out invites for “Glowtime” event on Monday September 9.

Never tell me the odds: Blasters, speeders, and sabacc

Does it run like a well-oiled droid?

She's got it where it counts, kid

Our rating: 3.5/5

In a galaxy teeming with Jedi and Sith, Star Wars Outlaws dares to ask: what about the rest of us? This ambitious open-world adventure thrusts players into the scuffed boots of Kay Vess , a quick-witted scoundrel carving out her own path through the criminal underworld. With a trusty blaster and an adorable alien sidekick, you'll pull off daring heists, navigate treacherous alliances, and maybe even find a family among the stars.But can Outlaws truly capture the roguish spirit that made characters like Han Solo and Lando Calrissian so beloved?Like any good smuggler's cargo, Outlaws comes loaded with both tantalising possibilities and potential complications. So, I delve into the game's sprawling planets, cinematic gunfights, and colourful cast to determine if it's got the chops to join the upper echelon of Star Wars games. So strap in and disengage those docking clamps - it's time to see if Star Wars Outlaws has enough scruffy-looking charm to win over even the most cynical space pirate.In a galaxy far, far away, between the events of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi , a new hero emerges from the shadows of the criminal underworld. Outlaws introduces us to Kay Vess, a scrappy young scoundrel with dreams bigger than her pockets. Orphaned and alone, Kay's been surviving on her wits and a quick trigger finger. Her only constant companion is Nix, an adorable alien critter that's part ferret, part axolotl, and all heart. Their bond forms the emotional core of Outlaws, giving weight to Kay's journey from selfish survivor to reluctant hero.The story kicks off with a classic setup – a heist gone wrong. Kay finds herself with a death mark courtesy of Sliro, the mysterious leader of the Zerek Besh syndicate. To clear her name and score the payday of a lifetime, she'll need to assemble a crew and pull off an even bigger job. It's familiar territory for fans of Ocean's Eleven or Guardians of the Galaxy, but the Star Wars twist keeps things fresh.As Kay hops between planets, she gathers a colourful cast of misfits and ne'er-do-wells. Standouts include ND-5, a reprogrammed battle droid with a dry wit, and Jaylen Barron, a smooth-talking fixer who brings Kay into the big score. We also get cameos from familiar faces like Jabba the Hutt and Crimson Dawn's Qi'ra, tying Outlaws neatly into the broader Star Wars timeline.The plot moves at a brisk pace, filled with double-crosses, narrow escapes, and high-stakes gambles. While it doesn't reach the epic scale of the movies, Outlaws spins an entertaining yarn that captures the spirit of Star Wars' criminal element. The real heart of the story, however, lies in Kay's growth. Watching her learn to trust and rely on others, forming a makeshift family along the way, gives the narrative genuine emotional punch.That's not to say the story is flawless. Some character motivations feel underdeveloped, and a few plot threads are left dangling by the end. The main storyline also stays fairly linear despite the open-world structure, which can feel at odds with the freedom promised elsewhere in the game. But even with these rough edges, Outlaws delivers an engaging tale that'll keep you invested through to the end.Ubisoft has given players a plethora of tools to live out their own Star Wars power fantasy. The core gameplay loop revolves around gunfights, stealth, and puzzle-solving as Kay infiltrates enemy bases and completes jobs for various factions.Combat is satisfying, with a responsive cover system and weighty gunplay. Kay's customizable blaster can switch between different fire modes on the fly, letting you adapt to different scenarios. Activating Kay's ""Focus"" ability slows down time for some truly cinematic shootouts – you'll feel like you're in the Mos Eisley Cantina in no time. Enemies put up a decent fight on higher difficulties, though the AI can be exploited at times.For players who prefer a quieter approach, Outlaws offers fairly robust stealth gameplay. Kay can sneak through tall grass, use distractions, and perform silent takedowns to avoid detection. Nix plays a big role here, able to scout ahead and mark enemies or disable security systems. Commanding your fuzzy companion adds a fun tactical layer to sneaking around. The stealth AI isn't the most sophisticated, but it works well enough to make ghosting through areas feel satisfying.As you progress, Kay gains access to new gear and abilities to expand her skillset. Rather than a traditional skill tree, you unlock new talents by completing challenges for ""Expert"" characters across the galaxy. It's an interesting system that ties progression to exploration and specific gameplay goals. The progression feels a bit slow at first, but by the late game you have a robust set of tools at your disposal.Outlaws features both planetside and space exploration. On the ground, you zip between objectives on Kay's speeder bike, which handles well and can be upgraded for better performance. Space flight is more of a mixed bag. Kay's ship, the Trailblazer, feels a bit clunky in dogfights. But soaring through asteroid fields and between capital ships still delivers some thrills. Space exploration is fairly limited, mostly confined to small orbital zones around each planet.The game's open world spans multiple planets, each with their own distinct biomes and settlements to explore. From the familiar dunes of Tatooine to the neon-lit streets of Kijimi, the environments feel authentically Star Wars while offering visual variety. Each world is packed with side activities and hidden collectibles to discover. You can take on bounties, play Sabacc in cantinas, bet on alien races, and more. It can feel a bit like checking boxes on a map at times, but the variety of diversions helps bring the Star Wars universe to life.The faction reputation system adds some consequence to your actions in the open world. Completing jobs for one syndicate may anger others, locking you out of certain areas or causing hit squads to come after you. It's not the deepest system, but it adds replay value and encourages you to think about your choices.While the gameplay is generally solid, there are some rough spots. Forced stealth sections in story missions can be frustrating if you're not specced for that playstyle. The open world activities, while plentiful, can start to feel repetitive after a while. And the space combat, while visually impressive, never quite reaches the heights of dedicated Star Wars flight sims.Visually, Outlaws is a treat for Star Wars fans. The environments are packed with the kind of lived-in detail that defines the franchise's aesthetic. Character models are expressive during cutscenes, though facial animations can look a bit stiff during gameplay conversations. Special effects like blaster bolts and explosions pop with colour and energy. Lighting is a particular strong point, with moody cantinas and neon-drenched streets creating atmosphere.On PC, performance can vary widely depending on your hardware. With a high-end system (RTX 3080, i7-10700K, 32GB RAM), we were able to maintain a mostly steady 60 FPS at 1440p with settings maxed out. However, busy areas like crowded city streets or intense combat scenarios could cause noticeable dips. Lower-end systems may struggle to maintain consistent framerates without significant visual compromises.Load times are generally quick, with seamless transitions when entering buildings. However, initial load times when booting up the game or fast travelling between planets can be lengthy. Some technical issues do crop up. Texture pop-in is fairly common, especially when first loading into an area. There were a handful of hard crashes, although frequent saves saved the effort.The sound design nails the Star Wars ambiance, from the distinctive pew-pew of blasters to the familiar hum of speeders and starships. John Williams' iconic themes are remixed and reimagined in ways that feel fresh while still unmistakably Star Wars. Voice acting is strong across the board, with the main cast delivering engaging performances. Alien languages and droid beeps add authenticity to the soundscape.Star Wars Outlaws doesn't reinvent open-world formula, but it brings that familiar formula to a galaxy far, far away in mostly successful ways. The main storyline delivers an engaging heist caper populated by charismatic characters, while the gameplay blends action, stealth, and exploration to capture the essence of being a charming rogue in galaxy full of opportunities and dangers.Where Outlaws stumbles is in fully realising its open-world structure. Many of the side activities feel disconnected from the main plot, and the faction system doesn't have as much impact as it could. The game seems caught between delivering a tightly-woven cinematic experience and offering true sandbox freedom. Then, there are technical hiccups and some half-baked systems that hold back Outlaws from being a masterpiece.Is Outlaws perfect? Not quite. But like Han Solo said, ""She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid."" The game has charm and moxie to spare, offering a unique perspective on the Star Wars universe that's worth experiencing despite its rough edges.For fans who have longed to carve out their own scoundrel's path through the galaxy, Outlaws scratches an itch that few other Star Wars games have attempted. It may not be the ultimate Star Wars experience, but it lays a promising foundation for future adventures in this seedier side of that galaxy far, far away.","Star Wars Outlaws is an ambitious open-world adventure.

"Melania Trump teases upcoming memoir in new video, promises to reveal 'the truth'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/melania-trump-teases-upcoming-memoir-in-new-video-promises-to-reveal-the-truth/articleshow/113110035.cms,"Former first lady Melania Trump on Thursday released an official teaser for her upcoming memoir , titled ""Melania”, in a black-and-white video shared on X and said that after years of ""public scrutiny and misrepresentation,"" it’s time for her to set “the truth” free.Describing the writing process as ""a deeply personal and reflective journey,"" Melania said, “I believe it is important to share my perspective: the truth.”“Writing this memoir has been a deeply personal and reflective journey for me,” the wife of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on X and shared her experience of penning her memoir.“As a private person, who has often been the subject of personal scrutiny and misrepresentation, I feel a responsibility to clarify the facts,” she added.According to the Daily Beast, the upcoming release of her autobiographical book is slated for September 24, a mere two months before the crucial November presidential election , despite her usual stance of being a “private person”, the former First Lady is determined to seize control of her own story and present her perspective to the public.The Slovenian-American former fashion model’s memoir offers a more budget-friendly option, with a signed “Collector’s Edition” priced at $150, and this edition is “printed on premium art paper with a custom white binding,” and features “black foil accents, embossing, and a ribbon marker.”There is limited information available on the site as to what the memoir will cover, though a brief description on the site hints that: “Melania is the powerful and inspiring story of a woman who has defined personal excellence, overcome adversity, and carved her own path. The former First Lady offers readers an intimate look into her world, revealing the extraordinary life she has lived.”According to the publisher, the book will feature ""stories and images never before shared with the public,"" the New York Post reported.Despite resenting previous claims that she is “shy,” as noted by Washington Post journalist Mary Jordan’s The Art of Her Deal, Melania has remained elusive to the public throughout her husband's political career.Melania has chosen to maintain a lower public profile compared to previous First Ladies, making fewer appearances than is customary. This approach has persisted even as her husband, Donald Trump, engages in a presidential race against Vice President Kamala Harris Despite reported pleas from several people within Trumpworld, Melania declined to deliver a speech at the Republican National Convention in July, instead, she opted to join her husband in their VIP box.Former White House communications director, Anthony Scaramucci, who has become a vocal critic of Trump, recently reasserted his earlier statements that Melania ""hates"" her husband and wants him to lose in November, Daily Beast reported.Journalist Victoria Brownworth in late August 2024 said on X, “Imagine that the lady who was furious she didn't get a Vogue cover as First Lady has a memoir with no photo of her on the cover like in every other memoir in history. It's a low-budget right-wing publisher, but still--couldn't Trump have sprung for a photo cover for his 3rd wife?”The release of ""Melania"" coincides with a period when her husband is under scrutiny for promoting an eclectic range of merchandise, including footwear, fragrances, and collectible cards, seemingly for his own financial benefit.","Melania Trump released an official teaser for her upcoming memoir, titled ""Melania,"" in a black-and-white video shared on X.

He was born on December 16, 1900, in the Okavango Delta, Botswana , a Unesco World Heritage Site .In the early 1900s, Henry was believed to have preyed on children from a local Botswana tribe. Frustrated with his deadly behavior, the tribe sought the help of renowned hunter Sir Henry Neumann in 1903. Instead of killing Henry, Neumann opted to capture him, sentencing the crocodile to a lifetime in captivity.Henry has spent the last thirty years at the Crocworld Conservation Centre in Scottburgh, South Africa. He is admired from a safe distance at the conservation centre, far removed from his violent past.Nile crocodiles, found across 26 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, are known for their aggressive nature. These apex predators inhabit various aquatic environments, including lakes, rivers, swamps, and marshes. Known for their brutality, Nile crocodiles often prey on animals such as zebras and porcupines. Tragically, hundreds of people fall victim to these formidable predators each year.Although Henry holds the title of the oldest crocodile, Cassius, a 16-foot saltwater crocodile from Australia, is known as the largest. Captured in 1984, Cassius is a prominent feature at the Marineland Melanesia Crocodile Habitat on Green Island, off the coast of Queensland. In 2011, he was officially recognized by Guinness World Records as the world’s largest living saltwater crocodile.","Henry was born on December 16, 1900, in the Okavango Delta, Botswana.

Cosplay: Fantasy meets reality: Why Chinese women are hiring female cosplayers to play dream men,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/fantasy-meets-reality-why-chinese-women-are-hiring-female-cosplayers-to-play-dream-men/articleshow/113095221.cms,"Bringing dream man to reality



Day out in the city



A new kind of relationship



Raising the bar



Emotional satisfaction in a new era



In the final years of high school, Xu Yunting, a Chinese teenager, stumbled upon an unusual side gig—transforming herself into male video game characters and taking their female fans on dates. What started as a way to make pocket money became part of a burgeoning trend in China, known as "" cos commissioning "".This unique job has taken off in China, with many young women using their purchasing power to transform digital fantasies into real-world experiences.The trend has sparked massive interest online, where social media platforms are buzzing with posts about cos commissioning.The concept? Fans of romance games hire female cosplayers to become their favorite male characters and accompany them on dates, creating a fusion of virtual fantasy and reality.Xu Yunting has perfected the art of embodying male characters from popular romance games. One of her most-requested roles is ""Jesse,"" a sensitive musician from ' Light and Night ,' a mobile game produced by tech giant Tencent that allows players to fall in love with various fictional men.Feng Xinyu, a lively 19-year-old, is one of Xu’s regular clients. For Feng, real-life men—whom she refers to as ""3D men""—don’t hold the same appeal as the perfect, fictional characters she encounters in games.“I’m just not interested in dating real guys,” Feng explains. “Game characters are more idealised and fulfilling to me.”'Light and Night' has become a favorite for young women like Feng. It promises a deeply immersive love experience, allowing players to develop emotional connections with their virtual suitors. Players like Feng, who identify as ""dream girls,"" often form intense emotional attachments to the game’s characters. Cos commissioning takes this to another level, bringing these 2D beaus into the real world.Feng has hired Xu three times now to play Jesse, each time paying roughly $70. However, Feng recently splurged on a much more expensive trip with another Jesse cosplayer, spending $2,800 for a multi-day experience. In the end, though, she decided that Xu captured the essence of Jesse better and returned to her for another date.“She’s just like the character,” Feng said to the AFP team. ""It feels like we were meant to be together.""Feng greeted Xu with delight when they met at the metro station. The two held hands and chatted happily as they embarked on their date, which Feng had meticulously planned and paid for.Starting with a relaxing tea break to an indulging hotpot dinner. Their date also included a doll-painting workshop and a cake-decorating class—activities where they were just one of many cos commission pairs.Businesses have taken notice of the trend. Employees at the cake-decorating class shared that they now regularly see cos commission couples. What began as a niche phenomenon is rapidly becoming mainstream.Experts suggest that cos commissioning isn’t just about fantasy—it’s about control and empowerment. The women paying for these experiences get to design their ideal relationship, free from the uncertainties and frustrations of dating real men. They also feel safer and more understood in these interactions, especially since many of the cosplayers, like Xu, are women themselves.“In these interactions, it doesn’t matter what gender the cosplayer is,” says Tian Qian, a professor at Fudan University. “What matters is that the cosplayer becomes a vessel for the client’s emotions, bringing their fantasy to life.”For many young women, the appeal of these interactions lies in their ability to construct an idealized, heteronormative relationship. Conservative social norms around gender roles still dominate Chinese society, often reinforced by state media and popular culture.Zhou Zixing, another academic, has observed that cos commissioning gives women an opportunity to experience relationships on their own terms, where their desires are prioritized.Xu, who enjoys bringing fictional characters to life, believes the experience of dating game characters can positively influence her clients’ expectations of real-life partners.""The men in these games are high-quality,"" Xu explained. ""By experiencing this kind of relationship, I think women can raise their standards in real life and avoid settling for less.""Xu’s mother, Fang Xiuqing, initially struggled to understand her daughter’s work. ""At first, I couldn’t believe this was something my daughter would do,"" Fang admitted. But over time, she has come to see cos commissioning as a harmless and enjoyable activity that brings joy to others.“It’s a hobby more than a job,” Fang said. “She’s happy doing it, and she makes other people happy too.”As the cos commissioning trend grows, it offers more than just a paid service—it provides emotional satisfaction for those who engage in it. Fudan University’s Tian Qian describes it as “emotional sustenance,” saying that even though the interaction is transactional, it still gives clients a sense of being cared for and seen.In a society where traditional dating norms can feel limiting, cos commissioning offers a creative and controlled way for women to engage in romance. For many, it’s not just about meeting their dream game character—it’s about constructing a relationship that caters to their needs, desires, and fantasies in ways real-world relationships often can’t.As this phenomenon continues to expand, it challenges conventional ideas of love and companionship, offering a glimpse into the evolving ways in which people form connections in the digital age.","'Cos commissioning' is a growing trend in China.

Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

"Apple, Google agreed to ‘defend’ search deal from regulators",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/apple-google-agreed-to-defend-search-deal-from-regulators/articleshow/103974460.cms,"Apple Inc.’s lucrative agreement to use Alphabet Inc.’s Google as the default search engine for the iPhone includes a provision that the two tech giants will “support and defend” the deal against government scrutiny, a top Apple executive said at an antitrust trial.Their longtime contract was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Services Eddy Cue disclosed Tuesday in a Washington federal court, where the US government is pressing its claim that Google operates a monopoly in the search business.Cue, the architect of the most recent version of the agreement, said the provision for a joint defense was added at Google’s request. He said it was handled by company lawyers so he couldn’t speak directly to why it was included. Around that time, the European Union was investigating Google’s dominance in online search.During his testimony, the executive defended Apple’s arrangement with its tech rival, saying it was the best choice for customers to have Google as the default search engine.“There certainly wasn’t a valid alternative we would have gone to at the time,” Cue said. “I don’t know what we would have done” if the deal had collapsed, he said.Google first became the default option in the Safari browser in 2002. That deal has been revised several times. Cue said the contract was extended in 2021, after the Justice Department filed its initial case against Google’s search dominance the year before.Google pays Apple billions of dollars for this prominent position on products like the iPhone, making the agreement of particular interest to the government. The question before the judge in the antitrust trial is whether the search giant pushed its way onto Apple devices at the expense of competitors.In his testimony, Cue stressed that Apple sees no need to develop its own search tool because Google clearly is the best option. That differs from the company’s approach in other areas: It competes with Google in mapping software and voice assistants, as well as operating systems for phones and computers.The Justice Department displayed an email from 2016 in which Cue told Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook that Google CEO Sundar Pichai was not agreeing to Apple’s proposed revenue share. When the Justice Department’s attorney asked Cue whether Apple would have walked away from the negotiation, Cue said he didn’t seriously consider it, but Apple might have created its own search engine.Part of Cue’s testimony Tuesday was closed to the public because it involved internal company information that Apple and Google want to keep secret.Cue was expected to testify behind closed doors about Apple’s search arrangements with other companies, which provide the non-default options built into the Safari internet browser, according to a person familiar with the planned testimony. That includes Microsoft Corp.’s Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo and Ecosia. Similar to its agreement with Google, Apple gets a slice of the advertising revenue generated when users select those search engines as their main option in Safari.Last week, Apple machine learning chief John Giannandrea testified as well. The executive, who led search at Google before joining Apple in 2018, pointed to a new feature in iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 — the latest software that runs iPhones and iPads — that lets users assign a different default search engine for private browsing.That means Apple users can switch between Google and another option more easily, according to Cue. “We like our products to come out of the box and work where it feels like magic,” he said. However, Apple doesn’t track how many customers actually make the change to a non-Google search engine, because of privacy concerns, Cue said.The case is US v. Google, 20-cv-3010, US District Court, District of Columbia.",Apple’s longtime contract with Google was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision.

Pavel Durov, CEO of Telegram , has recently become the subject of widespread speculation after older photos of him resurfaced online. These images have led many to wonder whether the billionaire entrepreneur underwent plastic surgery to enhance his appearance. Adding to the intrigue, Durov was recently arrested in France, raising further questions about the man behind the popular messaging app.Pavel Durov, a 39-year-old entrepreneur originally from Russia, is best known as the founder and CEO of Telegram, a messaging app launched in 2013.Telegram quickly gained popularity for its strong emphasis on user privacy, offering end-to-end encryption and other security features that set it apart from competitors. As of now, Forbes estimates Durov's net worth to be around $15.5 billion. Despite his success in the tech industry, Durov has managed to maintain a relatively low profile—until now.Durov's recent arrest in Paris has added a new layer of complexity to his public image. He was detained in France on charges of suspected complicity in running an online platform involved in illicit activities, including child exploitation, drug trafficking, and fraud. While these allegations are serious, it is the sudden focus on Durov's physical transformation that has captured the internet's attention.Pavel Durov has been active on social media platforms like Instagram since 2011, regularly sharing photos from his travels around the world. In his recent posts, Durov appears with a full head of hair and a toned physique, often posing shirtless in various locations. However, these recent images stand in stark contrast to older photos where Durov was seen with a noticeably receding hairline.The drastic change in his appearance has fueled rumours that Durov may have undergone plastic surgery, including a possible hair transplant. A popular post on X (formerly Twitter) by a well-known account shared a side-by-side comparison of Durov's old and new photos, sparking a flurry of online discussions. The post reads, ""Pavel Durov (Telegram CEO) before his hair transplant and plastic surgery,"" and has since gone viral.The speculation around Durov's transformation has been met with a variety of opinions online. On Reddit, users have debated whether the changes in Durov's appearance are the result of surgical procedures or simply better grooming and styling.One Reddit user commented, ""This isn't a hair transplant. His hair is too thick and full to have this kind of drastic change from a HT. Most likely he's wearing a hair system (wig).""Another user added, ""There's speculation that it's not a transplant, but rather a hair system because his hair loss was much more advanced in the first picture, so when the operation happens, the resulting hairdo never looks as full as his.""Some users believe the changes are the result of plastic surgery, with one theorising, ""This is well-done surgery.""However, not everyone is convinced that surgery is involved. One Reddit user opined, ""Honestly, I think a lot of the facial 'changes' are simply due to the much better angle and lighting in the second photo.""As the speculation continues, it's clear that Durov's transformation—whether natural or assisted—has caught the public's eye. The intense scrutiny of his appearance highlights the challenges that come with being in the spotlight, especially for someone as private as Durov. Whether or not he has undergone any procedures, the discussions around his looks reflect a broader societal fascination with image and success.","Pavel Durov, 39, is the founder and CEO of Telegram, a messaging app launched in 2013.
