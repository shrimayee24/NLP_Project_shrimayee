For over 20 years, Tom Brady and Bill Belichick built one of the NFL’s most iconic partnerships, leading the New England Patriots to six Super Bowl titles. While their success was undeniable, their dynamic was fueled by fierce competition even in practice. And though their journey ended with some friction, their playful rivalry and mutual respect continue to captivate fans, offering a glimpse into what made their dynasty so legendary.For two decades, Tom Brady and Bill Belichick built a dynasty with the New England Patriots, winning six Super Bowls together. But as Belichick revealed on ManningCast, their partnership also featured some playful competition on the practice field.Belichick admitted to offering equipment staff $100 to swat down Brady’s passes during 7-on-7 drills, aiming to toughen up the QB under pressure. However, Brady had his own plan. “Now the problem was Brady would pay them more. He’d pay them 200 bucks if he went through the whole practice and didn’t knock one down.” Belichick quipped, adding with humor, “Brady was making more than I was” (via: EssentiallySports)This lighthearted rivalry symbolized their competitive spirits, but cracks emerged toward the end of Brady’s Patriots career. In The Dynasty documentary, Brady admitted he wasn’t willing to stay in New England, saying, “Me and coach Belichick, we did what we loved and competed for 20 years together. But I wasn’t going to sign another contract [in New England] even if I wanted to play until [I was] 50. Based on how things had gone, I wasn’t going to sign up for more of it.”Despite reported friction in their later years, the mutual respect remains strong. Stories like this highlight the unique bond that drove their shared success and kept things interesting on and off the field.Also Read: Terry Bradshaw forced to apologize on Live TV, leaving daughter stunned by striking similarities to her father The Roast of Tom Brady on Netflix had NFL fans buzzing, especially when Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski hilariously roasted Bill Belichick’s newfound romance with 24-year-old Jordon Hudson .Belichick kicked things off, poking fun at Brady’s struggles managing Birmingham City FC. But Gronk stole the spotlight, joking about Belichick scouting his girlfriend at Foxborough High. Brady followed with a zinger: “Everybody asks me which ring is my favorite, I used to say ‘the next one. But now that I am retired, my favorite Ring is the camera that caught Coach Belichick slinking out of that poor girl’s house a few months ago. Hey, you still got it. Respect baby.”Six months later, Hudson cheekily responded on Instagram, celebrating their “Roast-iversary” while showing they’re still “applying bacitracin daily.” A playful reminder that even legends can take a hit and laugh it off.","Belichick admitted to offering equipment staff $100 to swat down Brady’s passes during 7-on-7 drills. “Now the problem was Brady would pay them more.

NEW DELHI: A recent Instagram video posted by Kolkata-based model Sannati Mitra has gone viral, sparking widespread outrage online. In the video, Mitra is seen dancing in a white towel at the iconic India Gate in Delhi, recreating a famous sequence from the Bollywood classicThe footage, uploaded in celebration of International Men's Day , quickly garnered over 2 lakh views within hours, but not without drawing sharp criticism from the public.In her caption, she wrote, ""Happy International Men’s Day. May you all continue to inspire and motivate others with your courage, kindness, and empathy.""Viewers expressed their displeasure at the seemingly inappropriate setting for such a performance, particularly in a public space revered for its historical significance.The footage shows Mitra twirling in the towel, with a visibly shocked crowd—including children—looking on. At one point, she partially removes the towel, further fueling the backlash.Social media users were quick to condemn the act, with many calling it a blatant attempt to gain fame through ""cheap tactics"" and ""obscenity.""While the video has caught the attention of many, it’s not the first time Mitra has faced controversy. Earlier, she had stirred a similar debate after sharing a photo taken at a Durga Puja pandal in Kolkata.In that instance, Mitra posed with two other women, wearing outfits that many considered unsuitable for a religious setting—Mitra herself donned a thigh-high slit black gown, while her friends wore similarly revealing attire.The incident sparked a wave of criticism on social media, with many condemning the women for disrespecting the occasion and the religious significance of the pandal.In response to the latest video, some social media users expressed outrage at what they perceived as a lack of respect for the martyrs commemorated at India Gate.One Instagram user demanded that Mitra be arrested for her actions, stating that she had ""crossed all limits"" by performing in such a manner at a site sacred to the nation. Another user voiced their frustration, calling for authorities to take action against the ""vulgarity"" displayed in a public place, especially in light of the historical importance of the location.Despite the backlash, Mitra defended her actions, stating that the video was intended as a tribute to the courage, kindness, and empathy of men.However, the public's response has been overwhelmingly negative, with many calling for stricter measures against such acts in the future.","Sannati Mitra, a Kolkata-based model, is facing backlash for a video posted on Instagram.

"US regulators seek to break up Google, forcing Chrome sale as monopoly penalty",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-regulators-seek-to-break-up-google-forcing-chrome-sale-as-monopoly-penalty/articleshow/115543434.cms,"The US justice department and a group of states asked a federal court late Wednesday to force Google to sell Chrome, its web browser, a move that could fundamentally alter the $2 trillion company's business and reshape competition on the internet.The request follows a landmark ruling in Aug by Judge Amit P Mehta of the US district court for the district of Columbia that found Google had illegally maintained a monopoly in online search. Judge Mehta asked the justice department and the states that brought the antitrust case to submit solutions by the end of Wednesday to correct the search monopoly.Beyond the sale of Chrome, the govt asked Judge Mehta to give Google a choice: either sell Android, its smartphone operating system, or bar Google from making its services mandatory on phones that use Android to operate. If Google broke those terms, or the remedies failed to improve competition, the govt could force the company to sell Android at a later date.The govt also asked the judge to stop Google from entering into paid agreements with Apple and others to be the automatically selected search engine on phones and in browsers. Google should also be required to allow rival search engines to display the company's results and access its data for a decade, the govt said. The proposals are the most significant remedies requested in a tech antitrust case since the justice department asked to break up Microsoft in 2000. If Judge Mehta adopts the proposals, they will set the tone for a string of other antitrust cases that challenge the dominance of tech behemoths, including Apple, Amazon and Meta.Being forced to sell Chrome and Android would be among the worst possible outcomes for Google. Chrome, which was introduced in 2008 and is free to use, is the most popular web browser in the world, with an estimated 67% of the global browser market, according to Statcounter, which compiles tech market data. Android is the world's most popular mobile software, with an estimated 71% of the market, according to Statcounter. The system is open-source, meaning that Samsung and other phone manufacturers do not have to pay Google for its use. But most Android devices come with Google's apps already installed.Google is set to file its own suggestions for fixing the search monopoly by Dec 20. Both sides can modify their requests before Judge Mehta is expected to hear arguments on the remedies this spring. Kent Walker, Google's president of global affairs, called the govt's proposal ""extreme."" ""DOJ's wildly overbroad proposal goes miles beyond the court's decision,"" he said. ""It would break a range of Google products - even beyond Search - people love and find helpful in their everyday lives.""","The US justice department and a group of states asked a federal court late Wednesday to force Google to sell Chrome, its web browser.

In a humorous new promo for the upcoming Invictus Games, Prince Harry shared a lighthearted moment with country singer Jelly Roll , where he joked about getting a tattoo on his lower back or 'a**.' The video, shared on Instagram, shows the Duke of Sussex sitting in a tattoo chair at East Side Ink tattoo shop in New York City, awaiting his “artist.”“Is he going to be here any time soon?” Harry asked, to which a staff member assured him the tattoo artist would arrive shortly.The suspense was quickly broken when Jelly Roll, whose real name is Jason Bradley DeFord, walked in wearing black gloves and greeted the prince with enthusiasm. “Hey, hey! Tattoos. Speaking of, what’s up, man?” the country star said, adding that he was “such a fan” of Harry.Jelly Roll expressed his surprise upon learning that Prince Harry wanted him to give him his first tattoo, but Harry clarified that he wasn’t there for a tattoo. Instead, he wanted Jelly to help promote the Invictus Games, which are set to take place in Vancouver in February 2025.Harry humorously added, “There’s no tattoo in this. I can’t get a tattoo.” However, Jelly Roll insisted that if Harry allowed him to give him a tattoo, they could play a game for the Invictus Games. With that, Harry gave in, saying, “Aight, screw it. Let’s go.”When Jelly suggested getting the tattoo on Harry’s neck, the prince joked, “I was thinking like, my lower back or my a**,” adding, “That’s the place where no one’s going to see it.” The singer then went on to jokingly tattoo “I am Jelly Roll” on Harry’s neck, which caused both men to laugh before Jelly quickly exited the room.The video ended with a message announcing Jelly Roll’s performance at the Invictus Games closing ceremony on February 16, 2025.Prince Harry, who founded the Invictus Games in 2014, has worked to create an international multi-sport event for wounded, injured, and sick servicemen and women.

North Korea's latest weapon? Bombarding South with noise,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/north-koreas-latest-weapon-bombarding-south-with-noise/articleshow/115482808.cms,"An Hyo-cheol does chores at his home on Ganghwa Island in South Korea, Oct. 31, 2024. Relations between the two countries have sunk to the lowest level in years, and now North Korea is using loudspeakers to blare eerie sounds across the border that South Korean villagers say is making their lives hell.

Gunshots, screams, eerie laughter: South Korea's border island Ganghwa is being bombarded nightly with blood-curdling sounds, part of a new campaign by the nuclear-armed North that is driving residents to despair.Before it started, 56-year-old Kim Yun-suk fell asleep to the hum of insects and woke to the chirping of birds. Now, she is kept awake every night by what sounds like the soundtrack of a low-budget horror movie at top volume.""The peaceful sounds of nature... have now been drowned out,"" Kim told AFP.""All we hear is this noise.""The campaign is the latest manifestation of steadily-declining ties between the two Koreas this year, which have also seen Pyongyang test ever more powerful missiles and bombard the South with trash-carrying balloons.Since July, North Korea has been broadcasting the noises for huge chunks of almost every day from loudspeakers along the border.The northern point of Ganghwa -- an island in the Han river estuary on the Yellow Sea -- is only about two kilometres (a mile) from the North.When AFP visited, the nighttime broadcast included what sounded like the screams of people dying on the battlefield, the crack of gunfire, bombs exploding, along with chilling music that started at 11:00 pm.In the almost pitch-black fields, sinister noises echoed as the stars in the clear night sky shone beautifully alongside the coastal road lights, creating a stark and unsettling contrast.North Korea has done propaganda broadcasts before, said 66-year-old villager Ahn Hyo-cheol, but they used to focus on criticising the South's leaders, or idealising the North.Now ""there were sounds like a wolf howling, and ghostly sounds"", he said.""It feels unpleasant and gives me chills. It really feels bizarre.""Ganghwa county councillor Park Heung-yeol said that the new broadcasts were ""not just regime propaganda -- it's genuinely intended to torment people"".TortureExperts said the new broadcasts almost meet the criteria for a torture campaign.""Almost every regime has used noise torture and sleep deprivation,"" Rory Cox, a historian at University of St Andrews, told AFP.""It is very common and leaves no physical scarring, therefore making it deniable.""Exposure to noise levels above 60 decibels at night increases the risk of sleep disorders, experts said, but AFP tracked levels of up to 80 decibels late at night on Ganghwa during a recent trip.""I find myself taking headache medicine almost all the time,"" An Mi-hee, 37, told AFP, adding that prolonged sleep deprivation due to the noise has also led to anxiety, eye pain, facial tremors and drowsiness.""Our kids can't sleep either, so they've developed mouth sores and are dozing off at school.""Distraught and desperate, An travelled to Seoul and got on her knees to beg lawmakers at the National Assembly to find a solution, breaking down in tears as she described the island's suffering.""It would actually be better if there were a flood, a fire, or even an earthquake, because those events have a clear recovery timeline,"" An said.""We have no idea if this will go on until the person in North Korea who gives the orders dies, or if it could be cut off at any moment. We just don't know.""'70s horror flick'The noise tormenting Ganghwa island residents appeared to be a rudimentary mix of clips from a sound library, typically common at any TV or radio broadcasters, audio experts told AFP.The sound effects are ""like something found in a South Korean horror film in the 70s and 80s,"" said sound engineer Hwang Kwon-ik.The two Koreas remain technically at war since the 1950 to 1953 conflict ended in an armistice not a peace treaty.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un this year declared Seoul his ""principal enemy"" and has ramped up weapons testing and built closer military ties with Russia.The isolated and impoverished North is known to be extremely sensitive about its citizens gaining access to South Korean pop culture.Some experts have suggested the latest broadcasts could be aimed at preventing North Korean soldiers from hearing the South's own propaganda broadcasts, which typically feature K-pop songs and international news.In August, just weeks after South Korea resumed K-pop broadcasts in response to Pyongyang floating trash-carrying balloons south, a North Korean soldier defected by crossing the heavily fortified border on foot.But Lee Su-yong, an audio production professor at the Dong-Ah Institute of Media and Arts, said ""if there is sound coming towards the North that you want to mask, then the sound (you use to cover it) must also be directed toward the North.""""It seems less about masking noise and more about inflicting pain on people in the South,"" he told AFP.Choi Hyoung-chan, a 60-year-old resident, said the South Korean government had failed to protect vulnerable civilians on the frontier.""They should come here and try to live with these sounds for just ten days,"" he told AFP, referring to officials in Seoul.""I doubt they could even endure a single day.""","North Korea is using loudspeakers to blare eerie sounds across the border.

The BBC vs. Logan Paul: what really happened?



Social media influencer, professional wrestler, YouTuber, entrepreneur, and actor, Logan Paul is one of the most sensation internet celebrities. The former WWE United States Champion often finds himself amid controversies. Recently, BBC has reported an alleged crypto scam involving Paul. BBC reporter Matt Shea planned to interview Paul about the crypto allegations but instead encountered a Paul lookalike who joined in chants accusing Shea. Paul later explained his reasons for the deception while launching several accusations against the BBC.Logan Paul has slammed the BBC, accusing the network of ""platforming predators for 50 years"" after a chaotic incident during a recent interview. BBC journalist Matt Shea walked out when, instead of Paul, a lookalike showed up for a segment intended for a documentary.The stunt came as Paul faced criticism for promoting cryptocurrencies without revealing his financial ties, leaving followers feeling misled. Paul defended his actions and fired back at the BBC with sharp allegations of his own.The BBC alleged that Paul promoted cryptocurrency investments to his followers without revealing his financial stake, which could have inflated their value. Of course, it was huge considering his wide fanbase. Paul has denied any wrongdoing. The broadcaster also claims that after he endorsed a crypto coin in 2021, a mysterious wallet linked to his public account made trades and eventually turned a $120,000 profit. Crypto wallets store digital keys for transactions and allow users to manage their funds, raising questions about the connection.In the BBC documentary Logan Paul: Bad Influence, reporter Matt Shea attempted to confront Paul about the allegations but instead encountered a lookalike. Paul later criticized the BBC in a video shared online.

René Magritte’s 'Empire of Light' smashed auction records on Tuesday, selling for over $121 million at Christie’s in New York. The 1954 masterpiece, initially valued at $95 million, surpassed the surrealist artist’s previous record of $79 million set in 2022.The painting, featuring a bright house under a blue daytime sky contrasted with a dark night, captivated collectors. Part of a series on light and shadow, it is one of Magritte's most iconic works.The piece belonged to the late Mica Ertegun, a Romanian-born interior designer and arts patron. Ertegun, who passed away in 2023, was a significant figure in the American cultural scene and the wife of Ahmet Ertegun, founder of Atlantic Records. The sale marked a highlight in the autumn auction season, with the buyer’s identity remaining undisclosed.This achievement places Magritte among an elite group of artists whose works have surpassed the $100 million mark at auction, alongside figures such as Picasso and Warhol. Marc Porter, chairman of Christie’s Americas, described the event as “a historic moment in our saleroom.”Surrealism, is a 20th-century art movement, aimed to unlock the unconscious mind by blending dreamlike imagery with reality. Originating in the 1920s, the movement was heavily influenced by Sigmund Freud’s psychoanalytic theories. It encouraged the use of unexpected juxtapositions and illogical scenes to challenge conventional perspectives.Artists like René Magritte, Salvador Dalí, and Max Ernst became synonymous with surrealism, crafting works that often provoked deep introspection or unease. Magritte, in particular, was celebrated for his ability to present ordinary objects in extraordinary contexts, forcing viewers to question their perceptions of reality.Elsewhere, a conceptual artwork by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan, sold for $6.2 million at Sotheby’s in New York. The piece, a single banana duct-taped to a wall, drew widespread attention during its 2019 debut at Art Basel Miami Beach, where debates raged over its artistic value.The latest sale, made to cryptocurrency entrepreneur Justin Sun, represents a staggering increase from its original price of $150,000. Sun purchased a certificate of authenticity permitting him to recreate the piece, which he announced he plans to “consume as part of the art experience.”","René Magritte's 'Empire of Light' sold for over $121 million at Christie's in New York.

Key Reasons the Video is Fake



The Trial Has Not Begun

No Life Sentence Has Been Issued

No Live-Streamed Hearings

Major News Outlets Have Not Reported It

Why the Video Gained Traction

What We Know So Far

He is under investigation for serious allegations, including sex trafficking and harassment.

The trial has not yet started, and no verdict or sentence has been issued.

Combs is currently in federal custody as investigations continue.

A video claiming to show hip-hop mogul Sean ""Diddy"" Combs collapsing during a court hearing after allegedly being sentenced to life in prison has taken social media by storm. However, the video is entirely fabricated. Here’s an in-depth look at why the claims in the video are false.Sean Combs is currently under investigation for serious allegations, including sex trafficking and harassment. The case has drawn significant public attention due to the severity of the charges and Combs' status as a prominent figure in Hollywood and the music industry.Despite the widespread interest, it’s important to clarify that the legal proceedings are still in their early stages. Investigations are ongoing, and the trial has not yet commenced. This means no verdict or sentence has been issued, making the claims in the video impossible.The most glaring issue with the video is that Sean Combs’ trial has not started. Legal proceedings take time, especially in cases of this magnitude. Currently, the case is still under investigation, and no hearings related to sentencing have occurred. Therefore, the claim that Combs received a life sentence is completely false.A life sentence is one of the most significant outcomes a court can issue, and such a development would be widely reported by credible news outlets. As of now, there is no record of Sean Combs receiving any form of sentencing, let alone a life sentence. The lack of such a monumental update in major news outlets is a clear indication that the video’s claims are baseless.Another important factor to consider is the absence of live-streamed court sessions. High-profile cases, especially those involving serious allegations, often have strict restrictions to maintain the integrity of the proceedings. None of the hearings in Sean Combs’ case have been live-streamed, which eliminates the possibility of such footage being authentic.A closer look at the video reveals inconsistencies that point to it being fabricated. The courtroom setting does not match known locations associated with the case, and there are signs of digital manipulation in the video’s quality and audio. These discrepancies further discredit the footage as authentic evidence.A development as significant as a life sentence for Sean Combs would dominate headlines across major news platforms. The silence from credible media organisations on such a dramatic claim is a strong indicator that the video is not genuine.Sean Combs’ case has captivated the public due to his high-profile connections and the severity of the allegations against him. This attention has made the case a magnet for rumours and speculation, including fabricated content like the viral video. The dramatic nature of the claims in the video likely contributed to its rapid spread online, despite its lack of authenticity.To summarise, here is what is currently known about Sean Combs’ legal situation:","A video claiming to show hip-hop mogul Sean ""Diddy"" Combs collapsing during a court hearing has taken social media by storm.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Security issues are spread deep inside

Security researchers have uncovered a concerning trend on Spotify: Playlists and podcasts promoting malware and pirated software. According to a report in 404 Media, people are using Spotify playlist and podcast descriptions to distribute spam, malware, pirated software and cheat codes for video games .One example, highlighted by security researcher Karol Paciorek, involved a playlist titled ""Sony Vegas Pro13 Crack Free Download 2024 mysoftwarefree.com."" This playlist blatantly advertised a website (mysoftwarefree.com) known to host malicious software.While Spotify reportedly removed the specific playlist in question, Paciorek warns that the problem is widespread. He claimed that users can easily find links to ""Vbucks generators"" (used to cheat in Fortnite) and ""license key cracks"" (used to activate pirated software) hidden within playlists and podcast descriptions. ""The playlist title in question has been removed,"" a spokesperson for Spotify told 404 Media in a statement. ""Spotify's Platform Rules prohibit posting, sharing, or providing instructions on implementing malware or related malicious practices that seek to harm or gain unauthorized access to computers, networks, systems, or other technologies.""The report claims that these listings often exploit Spotify's search engine optimization. Even if Spotify blocks certain keywords within the platform, searching for those keywords on Google still surfaces the malicious links hosted on Spotify.Spammers further manipulate the system by using irrelevant audio content and misleading titles related to popular topics, like TikTok or adult entertainment, to increase search visibility. One example is a podcast named ""forlinks"" with numerous short episodes that only contain descriptions linking to Turkish gambling sites. Podcast episode titles for such spam accounts often contain popular keywords about TikTok personalities or porn, boosting their search engine reach.","Security researchers have uncovered a concerning trend on Spotify.

Explained: 5 'demands' that are part of the US government's call to break-up Google,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/explained-5-demands-that-are-part-of-the-us-governments-call-to-break-up-google/articleshow/115535739.cms,"What Google said on the DoJ order

Here are some of the demands that the U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) lawyers have made in the case:

Sell Chrome Browser

Sell Android as Last Resort

Five-Year Ban on Browser Ownership

End Exclusive Deals with Apple and Publishers

Mandate Data Sharing and Search Result Licensing

US prosecutors have filed a sweeping antitrust lawsuit against Google, seeking to dismantle the tech giant's dominance in online search. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has proposed a series of drastic measures, including the forced sale of Google's Chrome browser and Android operating system. The DOJ argues that Google has abused its market power to stifle competition and harm consumers. The proposed remedies aim to level the playing field and promote fair competition in the online search market. The outcome of this lawsuit could have far-reaching implications for the tech industry and the broader economy.Responding to DoJ's ruling, Kent Walker, President of Global Affairs, Google & Alphabet, wrote in a blog post, ""DOJ had a chance to propose remedies related to the issue in this case: search distribution agreements with Apple, Mozilla, smartphone OEMs, and wireless carriers. Instead, DOJ chose to push a radical interventionist agenda that would harm Americans and America’s global technology leadership. DOJ’s wildly overbroad proposal goes miles beyond the Court’s decision. It would break a range of Google products — even beyond Search — that people love and find helpful in their everyday lives.""US prosecutors have proposed that Google divest its Chrome browser to an approved buyer. The DOJ argues that Google's dominance in both Chrome and Android creates significant barriers for competitors, as they are the primary channels for distributing search engines to users.The DOJ has also suggested that Google could divest its Android operating system if other remedies prove ineffective. This drastic measure underscores the severity of the government's concerns about Google's market power.To further level the playing field, the DOJ proposes a five-year ban on Google owning or investing in a browser, search engine, or related technologies. This would prevent Google from re-establishing its dominance through future acquisitions or investments.The DOJ seeks to end Google's practice of paying billions of dollars annually to Apple to be the default search engine on iPhones and iPads. Additionally, Google would be prohibited from entering into exclusive contracts with publishers that limit competitors' access to valuable content.The most far-reaching proposal requires Google to license its search results to competitors at a nominal cost and share user data with them, subject to privacy constraints. This would allow rivals to better compete with Google's powerful search engine.","US prosecutors have filed a sweeping antitrust lawsuit against Google, seeking to dismantle the tech giant's dominance in online search.

Here’s Zomato’s full response on ‘fraud restaurant’ listing

We have noticed social media conversations around

single-dish restaurants

listed on Zomato.

We have identified all such restaurants that were potentially fraudulent and have delisted them from our platform. To solve this more comprehensively, we have also investigated all other restaurants which have a very limited menu on Zomato and might have listed prohibited items or worked around a way to list prohibited items.

As per our policy, all restaurants listed on Zomato need to have a FSSAI license and we also actively block items such as alcohol, cigarettes/cigars/vapes from being listed on our platform. However, the restaurants highlighted were able to game our checks by using generic food names such as, ‘Naughty strawberry’, ‘Merry Berry’.

We have further strengthened our fraud checks to proactively identify such cases to avoid similar incidents in the future.

How Zomato found about suspicious “one-dish” restaurants

Zomato has taken action against suspicious “one-dish” restaurants listed on its platform. Following a social media uproar, the food delivery platform said that it has identified and delisted all potentially fraudulent restaurants.Earlier this week, several social media users raised concerns about some restaurant listings that have been offering single items with unusual names and prices.A Reddit post highlighted restaurants in Chandigarh offering single dishes with peculiar names like “Citrus Punch,” “Naughty Strawberry,” and “Blue Adventure” at exorbitant prices. Social media users speculated that these listings could be a cover for drug dealing or other illicit activities.Zomato also acknowledged that the suspicious restaurants had bypassed its checks by using generic food names to disguise prohibited items.",Zomato has taken action against suspicious “one-dish” restaurants listed on its platform.
