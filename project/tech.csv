"Prathyusha Challa, IIM graduate says family suffered five-year ordeal over sister-in-law's extortion bid",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/10-days-of-marriage-iim-graduate-says-family-suffered-five-year-ordeal-over-sister-in-laws-extortion-bid/articleshow/117072780.cms,"NEW DELHI: Prathyusha Challa , an IIM Ahmedabad graduate, has shed light on her family’s harrowing experience of alleged extortion by her former sister-in-law in a video that has gone viral, garnering over 2.8 million views on X. The revelation comes amid widespread outrage following the suicide of Bengaluru techie Atul Subhash, which has reignited discussions around domestic violence against men.In the video, Challa recounted how her brother, an assistant professor at a Hyderabad engineering college, married a woman from Rajahmundry in 2019. However, the marriage lasted just 10 days.“She misbehaved with my parents, spoke foul language, and did not let my brother into his own bedroom. She often threatened suicide. This was clearly an extortion plan by my sister-in-law, her sister, her brother, and her boyfriend. Her sister had also executed a similar extortion plan with her in-laws. Ten days after she left our home, she filed a 498 case ( Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) that deals with cruelty against a married woman by her husband or his relatives) against us. The FIR was filed without our knowledge or any investigation,” Challa alleged in the video.Even after five years, Challa revealed, the trial has yet to commence, leaving her family in a state of prolonged distress. “It has been 5 years since this incident, and the trial for this case has not yet begun. This has been traumatising. My parents’ health has declined,” she shared.Challa also spoke about how the case has impacted her career. Despite her stellar academic background—an alumna of IIM Ahmedabad and IIT Gandhinagar—and previous role as a Vice President at Goldman Sachs, she admitted to struggling professionally. “Despite my flawless academic records, I have been unable to find a job,” she said, pointing to the pending criminal case as a major obstacle.The video sparked an outpouring of reactions on social media, with many netizens criticising flaws in the arranged marriage system and sharing similar experiences.“Arranged marriage is injurious to mental health,” one user commented. Another wrote, “A friend of mine, day 1 of marriage, she didn't let him even touch her, no talks, nothing, living in separate rooms. Weeks passed, he found she is always on the phone with someone. One fine day he got home from work only to see them having fun on his bed.”","Prathyusha Challa, an IIM Ahmedabad graduate, has shed light on her family’s harrowing experience of alleged extortion by her former sister-in-law in a video that has gone viral.

Palisades fire press conference: Los Angeles officials, Gavin Newsom say 'this is not a drill'

California Governor Gavin Newsom and LA Fire Chief Kristin Crowley stood before the roaring Pacific Ocean , delivering an emotional plea about the dire water crisis fueling the Palisades Fire . The blaze, now tearing through the scenic Pacific Palisades, has overwhelmed firefighting efforts, with officials lamenting a critical shortage of water.""If we only had an enormous body of water next to us!"" Governor Newsom exclaimed, gesturing toward the horizon where the ocean stretched endlessly, reported the Genesius Times.Despite the irony of standing near one of the world’s largest water sources, officials appeared to skirt its potential use. Chief Crowley, visibly distressed, described the situation grimly. “We’re out of water to fight this fire. We’ve exhausted all resources,” she said, her focus firmly on the billowing smoke rather than the ocean.The absurdity didn’t escape the gathered press. A reporter eventually broke the tension with the obvious question: “We’re standing next to the Pacific Ocean. Isn’t that an option?”Crowley’s response was both baffling and inflammatory. “I don’t know what you’re talking about. Are you a racist bigot?” she retorted, leaving reporters and onlookers stunned, reported the Genesius Times.Social media erupted in disbelief. Hashtags like #OceanBlindness and #WaterRightThere began trending, with users blending humor and frustration. “Maybe they should just,” quipped one user, sharing a photo of the sprawling ocean alongside the wildfire's smoke.While the officials’ apparent oversight provided ample fodder for memes, environmental experts stepped in to provide clarity. They highlighted the challenges of using seawater for firefighting, including its corrosive nature and the ecological concerns of large-scale extraction. “It’s not as simple as dumping ocean water on the fire,” one activist explained, though critics argued this was a moment for pragmatic, not philosophical, solutions.The state is now scrambling to revise its emergency response strategy , with potential plans including mobile desalination units and equipment to use ocean water effectively. Governor Newsom sought to refocus on the urgency of the situation, saying, “We’re doing everything in our power to combat this fire. We’re in uncharted waters here—no pun intended.”","California Governor Gavin Newsom and LA Fire Chief Kristin Crowley stood before the roaring Pacific Ocean.

She titled the tribute ""advocating for pet adoption with a compilation of photographs and videos.""In 2015, I adopted a beagle from a dog rescue in Canada. He had been at a kill shelter in Kentucky and given a few days to live. I swooped him up….and fell in love. They referred to him as ‘the little guy’ because he was so small and frail, so I named him ‘Guy’. And he was the best guy any girl could have asked for,"" the mother-of-two said in her post.Meghan continued, ""He endured a terrible accident shortly before I moved to the UK which had him undergoing surgeries for several months and unable to leave the clinic. Doctors said he would never walk again, but Dr Noel Fitzpatrick said he could do it. He and I would drive late at night, after hours, to see Guy as he recovered in Surrey for months on end.""This marks her third Instagram post since launching her Netflix series on her new account,""If you followed me on Instagram back in the day, you saw a lot of him - and on The Tig too. He was with me at Suits, when I got engaged, (and then married), when I became a mom….he was with me for everything: the quiet, the chaos, the calm, the comfort,"" she said.""Thank you for loving him so much,"" she wrote, conveying her appreciation to Dr Noel and the team at Queen West Animal Hospital .""As many of you will see Guy in this new series, I hope you’ll understand why his loss has devastated me. I think you might fall a little in love with him too,"" she further emphasised.""I have cried too many tears to count - the type of tears that make you get in the shower with the absurd hope that the running water on your face will somehow make you not feel them, or pretend they’re not there. But they are. And that’s okay too. Thank you for so many years of unconditional love, my sweet Guy. You filled my life in ways you’ll never know,"" the Suits star added., the anticipated programme, launching on January 15, will showcase the Duchess sharing her expertise in cooking and gardening, the Daily Mail reported.Additionally, viewers might also have noticed a black Labrador in the brief promotional footage for Meghan's Netflix programme - Pula, who joined the family before Archie's arrival in 2019.","The Duchess of Sussex announced the passing of her beloved dog, Guy, in a heartfelt Instagram tribute.

What is the THAAD System?

Key features of THAAD include:

Range and coverage: Capable of engaging targets up to 200 kilometres away, THAAD covers a larger area than the Patriot missile system and complements other defence platforms like the Aegis and Ground-based Midcourse systems.

Capable of engaging targets up to 200 kilometres away, THAAD covers a larger area than the Patriot missile system and complements other defence platforms like the Aegis and Ground-based Midcourse systems.

A THAAD battery includes six truck-mounted launchers, 48 interceptors, an advanced AN/TPY-2 radar system, and a fire control unit. Deployment: Operated by a crew of 95 soldiers, the system is rapidly deployable and designed to protect against evolving missile threats both within and outside the atmosphere.

The United States' Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system was deployed in Israel to intercept a Houthi ballistic missile launched from Yemen, Times of Israel reported. This marks the first operational use of the advanced missile defence system since its deployment to Israel in October. Footage shared on social media captured the dramatic launch of a THAAD interceptor, with an American soldier exclaiming, ""Eighteen years I’ve been waiting for this.""The missile, reportedly targeting Israel, was neutralised by air defence systems. However, the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) have not specified whether the interception was achieved by the American THAAD or an Israeli system. According to sources cited by Reuters, an analysis is underway to determine the success of the THAAD system.The Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system is a cornerstone of the US ballistic missile defence network. Designed to intercept short- to intermediate-range ballistic missiles during their terminal phase, THAAD employs “hit-to-kill” technology, where interceptors physically collide with incoming missiles to destroy them. This approach minimises collateral damage and maximises precision.Originally developed by Lockheed Martin in the 1990s, THAAD has undergone significant testing and enhancements. The US Army currently operates seven THAAD batteries, with deployments in strategic locations such as Guam and South Korea, and most recently, Israel.","The Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system is a cornerstone of the US ballistic missile defence network.

Sandringham's history and royal tensions

Happier times at Sandringham

The Royal Family gathers at King Charles' Sandringham estate in Norfolk each Christmas, continuing a tradition dating back to Queen Victoria. The 20,000-acre estate, purchased in 1862, holds significant historical value for the family. George V, former king of the UK, famously cherished Sandringham, saying, ""Dear old Sandringham, the place I love better than anywhere else in the world."" More than 160 years after it was first acquired by the royal family, the estate remains a cherished setting for the royal Christmas celebrations.The preparations for the holiday include selecting a large Christmas tree from the estate grounds, a tradition started by King Charles' great-great-great-grandfather, Prince Albert. King Charles selects a 20-foot Norfolk spruce tree from the grounds each year. The tree is typically decorated with red, gold, and purple ornaments, along with twinkling Christmas lights. The Grand Staircase is often adorned with festive decorations, and the Waterloo Chamber is transformed into a winter wonderland.The King also approves menus for Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and Boxing Day. The chef traditionally carves the turkey in front of the guests. However, one change King Charles may make concerns the temperature in the home. Prince Harry previously described Sandringham’s temperature as “balmy,” saying, “The corgis always betrayed us. The cool air would make them whimper, and Granny would say: 'Is there a draft?' And then a footman would promptly shut the window.”Guests arrive on Christmas eve based on seniority. As Sandringham is the smallest of the royal residences, some guests may have to sleep in rooms typically reserved for staff. One quirky tradition involves guests weighing themselves upon arrival. A tradition from Edward VII involved weighing guests upon arrival and departure to ensure they were well-fed.The family enjoys afternoon tea at 4 pm, with favorites such as square sandwiches, ham and English mustard, Sage Derby cheese, and Coronation Chicken. Desserts include ginger cake, honey and cream sponge, scones, and a pot of Earl Grey tea.At 6 pm, the family exchanges small, humorous gifts, a nod to the German tradition of ""Heiligabend Bescherung,"" introduced by Prince Albert. Princess Diana once gave Sarah Ferguson a leopard print bath mat, while Kate, Princess of Wales, gifted a ""grow your own girlfriend"" kit to a bachelor Prince Harry.Later in the evening, after the children go to bed, a formal dinner is served for the adults, with men in black tie and women in ballgowns and jewels. The meal is followed by martinis and a lavish four-course feast.Christmas day starts with breakfast and an 11 am church service at St Mary Magdalene Church. The royals greet the crowds as they leave the church. The family returns to Sandringham for pre-lunch drinks, including Veuve Clicquot champagne, and a traditional Christmas dinner at 1 pm. The meal includes turkey, potatoes, vegetables, sprouts, carrots, and parsnips, with Christmas pudding served with brandy butter and brandy sauce, followed by a cheese course with port. The table is decorated with white linen, candelabras, and a sprig of the Holy Thorn, a tradition that dates back before the Reformation.The King's speech is watched on television afterward. The family spends the rest of the afternoon at leisure.In the evening, guests enjoy a buffet of traditional English cuisine, including boar's head, ox tongue, and seafood, along with a table of chocolates and mints.Boxing Day features a hunt for the men, followed by lunch and dinner with traditional dishes. The meal typically consists of hearty fare, such as beef bourguignon with mashed potatoes and red cabbage. For dessert, there is apple pie and Christmas pudding slices fried in unsalted butter. Dinner that evening might feature venison with dauphinoise potatoes and carrots, followed by a chocolate pie made of cream, meringue, and cinnamon.Sandringham has witnessed its share of controversy over the years. Princess Diana, who was often unhappy spending Christmas at the estate, would frequently chat with the staff to avoid family members. Royal chef Darren McGrady recalled how Diana would walk around the kitchen after dinner, seeking refuge from the tight quarters of the estate, which he described as “so compact.”In Andrew Morton's biography, Diana was quoted describing a dramatic row with Prince Charles in 1982 when she was pregnant with Prince William. ""I threw myself down the stairs,"" she reportedly said. ""Charles said I was crying wolf, and I said I felt so desperate, and I was crying my eyes out, and he said: 'I'm not going to listen. You're always doing this to me. I'm going riding now.'""Sandringham also hosted a tense summit in January 2020 between King Charles and his sons, Prince William and Prince Harry, after Harry announced he would step back from royal duties. The meeting led to a public statement from the Queen, wishing Harry and Meghan a “peaceful and happy new life.” Meghan Markle , who enjoyed her first Christmas at Sandringham in 2017, shared a fond memory with her mother. “It’s just like a big family like I always wanted,” she said during a phone call. ""There was just this constant movement and energy and fun."" Prince Harry also spoke of happier times, saying, ""Christmas was fantastic.""","The Royal Family gathers at King Charles' Sandringham estate in Norfolk each Christmas.

'Diana hated Sandringham'

‘No boisterous behavior’

Disappointment over gag gifts

Familiar yet unwelcome traditions

Royal experts weigh in

Princess Diana reportedly 'hated' spending Christmas with the royal family at Sandringham Estate in UK. Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine, revealed that Diana found the royal holiday traditions “claustrophobic.”Speaking to Fox News Digital, Seward explained that Diana felt constrained by the royal customs, saying she did not want to follow so many rules to enjoy herself. “Diana hated Sandringham,” Seward said. “Even when her romance with Charles was going well, she still didn’t like it… I think she found it claustrophobic because Diana was such a free spirit. She didn’t want to have to enjoy herself with so many rules. [But] they’re not rules. They’re just traditions of royalty.” Seward noted that the order of precedence and other royal traditions made Diana uncomfortable.In his 1992 book Diana: Her True Story, author Andrew Morton recounted Diana’s experience during her first Christmas at Sandringham in 1981. She had given expensive gifts, while the royal family exchanged gag gifts.“It was highly fraught,” Diana told Morton. “I know I gave, but I can’t remember being a receiver. Isn’t that awful? I do all the presents, and Charles signs the cards. [It was] terrifying and so disappointing. No boisterous behavior, lots of tension, silly behavior, silly jokes that outsiders would find odd, but insiders understood.” Diana added, “I sure was [an outsider].”Seward corroborated this story, sharing that a friend who worked at Sandringham witnessed Diana’s disappointment. Diana reportedly gave cashmere sweaters and other expensive items but received a simple, less thoughtful gift in return. “She just couldn’t understand [it],” Seward said. “To her, Christmas was all about spending a bit more than you could probably afford and getting really nice presents.”Despite her dislike for the traditions, Diana was familiar with Sandringham as her father had a house on the estate. However, her hairdresser, Richard Dalton, told author Kitty Kelley that Diana “hated going to Sandringham for Christmas,” mentioning the cold and the requirement to watch the Queen’s Christmas message on television. Dalton referred to it as a “command performance.” An unnamed friend also told author Tina Brown that Diana dreaded going to Sandringham.Royal experts shared their views on Diana’s experience at Sandringham. Hilary Fordwich explained that Diana’s gift-giving experience was “embarrassing and painful,” as she wasn’t aware of the family’s gag gift tradition. Nick Bullen, co-founder of True Royalty TV, commented that the royals exchange “silly joke presents,” with author Christopher Andersen noting that Queen Elizabeth II preferred gag gifts. Andersen also claimed that Prince Charles’ favorite gift was a toilet seat from Princess Anne.King Charles and Diana had separated in 1992 and divorced in 1996.","Princess Diana reportedly 'hated' spending Christmas with the royal family at Sandringham Estate in UK.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Moraes suspended X in Brazil

A Brazilian Supreme Court judge has issued a stern warning to tech companies, saying that they must adhere to Brazilian laws to continue operating in the country. Justice Alexandre de Moraes , who temporarily suspended Elon Musk-owned X (formerly Twitter) in Brazil, stressed that the court will not tolerate the exploitation of hate speech for profit.“In Brazil, (the companies) will only continue to operate if they respect Brazilian legislation, regardless of the rant of Big Tech managers,” Moraes said, as per news agency Reuters.While Moraes did not name any specific company, his remarks came shortly after Meta announced plans to discontinue its US fact-checking program and loosen restrictions on discussions surrounding controversial topics.Moraes, speaking at an event commemorating the second anniversary of the January 8 riots in Brazil, underscored the importance of respecting Brazilian legislation, regardless of the opinions of Big Tech executives.Meanwhile, Brazilian prosecutors have requested clarification from Meta regarding whether the changes to its fact-checking program in the US will also apply to Brazil. Meta has been given 30 days to respond as part of an ongoing investigation into online misinformation and violence.On August 30, 2024, Moraes ordered the suspension of X (formerly Twitter) in Brazil, accusing the platform of failing to comply with local laws requiring the appointment of a legal representative in the country.This decision resulted in a complete shutdown of X's operations in Brazil. Major tech companies like Apple and Google, along with Brazilian internet service providers (ISPs), blocked access to the platform for their users, effectively cutting off millions of Brazilians from the social media service.The suspension, initially ordered by Moraes and later unanimously upheld by a Supreme Court panel, led to a clash between Moraes and X owner Elon Musk, who criticised the judge's actions as censorship.",Justice Alexandre de Moraes has issued a stern warning to tech companies.

iPhone SE 4 may have a new name

Apple may introduce the new iPhone SE and iPad 11 by April 2025, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. A report previously suggested that these devices would launch alongside iOS 18 .3 and iPadOS 18.3, but Gurman clarified that while the products are being developed on the same software ""train,"" their release may not coincide with the updates. Instead, Gurman stated that Apple is targeting a release “before iOS 18.4,” offering a more specific timeframe for the highly anticipated devices.Taking to microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), Gurma wrote “Yes, the new iPads and iPhone SE replacement are being developed on the iOS 18.3 train - but that doesn’t mean they launch together this month”. Adding further, he said “It means they’ll launch before iOS 18.4, by April if all goes to plan.”According to multiple sources familiar with the matter, iPhone SE 4 may be rebranded as the iPhone 16E . The naming speculation originated from Chinese social media platform Weibo user Fixed Focus Digital and was later corroborated by leaker Majin Bu on X (formerly Twitter). While neither source has an established track record with Apple rumors, the potential rebranding would align the budget model more closely with Apple's flagship iPhone 16 lineup. The potential name change would mark a significant shift from Apple's previous ""SE"" branding for its budget iPhone line.The device is rumored to receive a major redesign, adopting the modern aesthetics of the iPhone 14 and moving away from the dated iPhone 8-style design of the current SE model. Key upgrades include a 6.1-inch OLED display, Face ID authentication, and a USB-C port, replacing the Touch ID button and Lightning connector found on the current model.Sources indicate the device will feature a single 48-megapixel rear camera, 8GB of RAM, and Apple's latest A-series chip to support new AI features. The company is also expected to implement its first in-house designed 5G modem in the device.","Apple may introduce the new iPhone SE and iPad 11 by April 2025, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.
