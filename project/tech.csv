Booker prize winner Banu Mushtaq on giving voice to India’s silent sufferings,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/from-village-courts-to-world-stage-how-banu-mushtaqs-stories-of-women-and-margins-won-the-booker/articleshow/121328606.cms,"Banu Mushtaq, author of 'Heart Lamp' holds the trophy after winning the International Booker Prize

Banu Mushtaq, a longtime women’s rights advocate and Kannada writer, won the 2025 International Booker Prize for Heartlamp, a collection of short stories drawn from decades of listening to the silences and struggles of Indian women.

In this conversation with Jaya Bhattacharji Rose, she shares why she writes, how pain becomes protest, and what her win means for voices from the margins

Q: Maybe I'll address Banu first. Why did you choose to write fiction?

Q: But it requires more than just listening. It requires something else to make you write and write with the precision that you have.

Q: The ordinariness of the scenarios that you depict in your stories and the violence which is depicted is not necessarily always physical violence.

Q: There is a sense of universality about the kind of violence depicted because Deepa (Bhasthi) has chosen different phases of motherhood or that of a woman's life or a child’s life, isn't it?

Q: Deepa, what was your principle of curation?

Q: The compilation of stories have different phases of a girl or a woman's life. Was that a conscious decision?

Q (to Banu Mushtaq): Writers do tend to put in a bit of their own DNA. They tend to put in a bit of their own experiences. Would it be fair or would it be too far-fetched to say that there are glimpses of semi-autobiographical elements in these stories?

Q (to Deepa Bhasthi): Banu speaks Dakhni, a fascinating mix of Persian, Dehlvi, Marathi, Kannada and Telugu. But your mother tongue is Havyaka, a dialect that harks back to old Kannada and is spoken by a small community of Brahmins from the Arabian coast. But the rhythm of the English flows beautifully. How did this process come about?

A: What else can I do? I cannot provide any relief to the aggrieved women who approach me with a lot of worries, sorrows and while I take up their cause, earlier as an activist and further as an activist-cum-advocate, I do struggle to get them relief, but, at the same time, I want to document it and show the entire world that patriarchy cannot continue to commit violence against women in this way and it has to be stopped.A: I cannot simply forget their issues. It haunts me like anything and it never allows me to be at peace. I want to be a voice to their worries and I want to voice all their issues and say to the entire world that these women should be compensated, they should be liberated and they should be given their due place and you should not perpetrate this type of all violence against them continuously.Stop it. Somebody has to say no. That's what I'm saying.A: Even along with the women's issue, there is the issue of marginalised people. I wanted to show even marginalised people, and those from the minority community, are human beings. They have their own issues, their own problems. I want to share their experiences with the entire world and to bridge the gap and to open a window.A: Yes, I have addressed patriarchy. Patriarchy is prevalent among all sections of society, all communities and it is universal in nature. And I have addressed this patriarchy and I have challenged the power structure which is subjugating women and compelling them to stay within four walls and which is compelling them to adhere to their orders without questions.A: I see translation as a very instinctive process. I'm not sure I am quite able to intellectualise the politics of choice at the moment, at least maybe it's something that I need to think about for a long time. But that said, I'm very interested in the idea of choice when it comes to the practice of translation, because translation is about choosing one this word over that or one phrase over the other. A lot went into the selection of these stories, first and foremost stories that I personally liked as well, because it is important for me to enjoy the stories I'm working with. And then I wanted it to be a career-spanning selection. I wanted to bring a variety of themes that were being explored in these stories. And what was also interesting for me was even though there are different stories, the underlying theme is always the treatment of women under patriarchal systems.A: These were part of the many factors that I was looking into when I was making these choices. So one of the factors was to look into how women were treated in different situations and circumstances. And, the life cycle of a woman from childhood to girlhood to a new wife and and so on. There are interesting things about the multiple roles that are foisted upon a girl child or the periods of discomfort that she can feel.A: In my stories, there are no very serious autobiographical elements, but day-to-day experiences that women shared with me, that has been the raw material for my stories. As an activist and as an advocate, I meet many women every day. They come and talk to me and sometimes I counsel them, sometimes I get them legal relief.They think me as a counsellor and they start telling so many things which are not necessary for a legal drafting.A: Multilinguality is not as rare as we like to think it is, especially in the South Indian context. We engage with a lot of different languages, at least three, and likely more. So, words or phrases from another language creep into our everyday conversations. And I was very clear from the beginning that I wanted to maintain this multilinguality in the translation and not flatten it out into just English, and I was very aware of the musicality of the Kannada language, which i hopefully managed to preserve by retaining some words. And the decision to italicise or not, I think is super important. It is anothering of the language itself when you do it, and when you don't, it sort of blends into the English that the reader is experiencing in the book as well. And I think somewhere along the way, we all seem to have decided that English is this very precious object which must not be touched and played around with. And I wanted to completely reject that premise because we don't speak like the British, we don't speak like the Americans. And I think that is where the musicality is retained. And when you bring in these everyday experiences of multilinguality into a translation by retaining the Dakini or Arabic or Urdu or Kannada or whatever other languages, I think that is where the retaining of the cadence, the musicality, the rhythm, those things remain in the translation.Q (to Banu Mushtaq): You do not capitulate to any form of othering, but you choose to depict life as it is within the community. You bring in the syncretic culture that we live in, a cross-pollination of experiences of our diversity.A: Our culture teaches us, whether it be Hindu or Muslim or Christian or whether it may be Kannadiga or Tamil or Malayali, the culture of human beings, the culture of neighbourhood. So we are Muslims, and if there was a feast the female elders of the family would bring a plate of sweets, coconut, prawn, flowers, everything to share with our neighbours, who were vegetarian. Though they won't take non-veg food, we used to go to their home and we used to offer them sweets and all these types of things. And they would invite us for their feasts. And this culture of coexistence is there even today. The fabric seems to be tarnished, but it remains there. So, there is no question of othering. There is a question of only inclusiveness.","Banu Mushtaq, a longtime women’s rights advocate and Kannada writer, won the 2025 International Booker Prize for Heartlamp.

Microsoft announced last week that it is laying off approximately 6,000 employees, nearly 3% of its global workforce—in what marks the company's second-largest job reduction in its history.

""I chose to stay a little longer—showing up for meetings, saying goodbye, wrapping up what I could. That felt right to me,"" she explained in her social media posts.The irony of laying off an AI director while the company invests heavily in AI technology wasn't lost on industry observers. One Microsoft vice president recently told his team to use AI chatbots to generate half their computer code, up from the current 20-30%, before more than a dozen engineers on his team were subsequently laid off.""But if you know me, you know I always look at the bright side. I'm an optimist at heart. That hasn't changed. My smile, my gratitude, my belief that each day is a gift—that's all still here,"" Gabriela de Queiroz wrote, maintaining her positive outlook despite the circumstances.The cuts affect all levels, teams, and geographies as Microsoft streamlines operations and reduces management layers. ""What's next? I don't know yet. It's too soon to say. But I trust that something good will come out of this,"" Gabriela de Queiroz concluded, addressing fellow impacted employees: ""To those also affected—you're not alone. We are at least 6,000.""In another news, a Microsoft employee disrupted the company’s annual developer conference, Build 2025, in Seattle on May 19. The employee protested against the company’s Cloud and AI work with the Israeli government.Microsoft recently announced it will lay off 3% of its global workforce, affecting thousands of employees across all levels, teams, and geographies, amounting to over 6,000 employees. The cuts at the Redmond giant, which employed 228,000 people as of last June, aim to reduce management layers and streamline operations.In a related news, Microsoft's Build 2025 event faced disruption as an employee, Joe Lopez, protested against the company's contracts with the Israeli government, shouting slogans like 'Free Palestine'. This follows similar protests at Microsoft's 50th-anniversary celebrations. Lopez, a Microsoft Azure veteran, claims the company's technology aids in harming Palestinian civilians, a claim Microsoft denies.","Microsoft recently announced it will lay off 3% of its global workforce, affecting thousands of employees across all levels, teams, and geographies.

Amid privacy push, Telegram’s viral contest takes aim at WhatsApp

Pavel Durov’s recent statements on political pressures

Implications for users and content creators



Contest evaluation and future prospects



In the highly competitive landscape of instant messaging platforms, Telegram, a popular messaging app founded by Pavel Durov , has initiated a bold new contest aimed at content creators. The competition offers a prize pool of $50,000 for a viral video that underscores Telegram’s claim of being the original innovator in messaging technology — years ahead of its competitor WhatsApp, which Telegram labels a “cheap copycat.”This initiative marks Telegram’s first contest designed specifically for content creators, signaling the company’s increased focus on leveraging user-generated content to raise awareness about its platform’s unique features and capabilities. The contest was announced on May 19, 2025, by Pavel Durov himself, and aims to counteract alleged smear campaigns against Telegram by WhatsApp. With a submission deadline set for May 26, 2025, the campaign encourages participation from global audiences, aiming to clarify Telegram’s contributions to the messaging industry.Telegram and WhatsApp are two of the largest messaging platforms worldwide, both competing for dominance in the instant communication space. WhatsApp, owned by Meta Platforms Inc., boasts over two billion users globally, while Telegram, known for its focus on privacy and advanced features, has seen rapid growth, particularly in regions emphasizing secure messaging. The rivalry has intensified over the years, with Telegram frequently highlighting its pioneering features that WhatsApp later incorporated, and vice versa.Pavel Durov, Telegram’s CEO and founder, has publicly accused WhatsApp of conducting smear campaigns against Telegram, aiming to undermine its reputation. In response, Telegram’s new contest serves as a public relations strategy to emphasize Telegram’s innovative edge and solidify its position among messaging app users.The contest invites participants to create a viral video no longer than three minutes (180 seconds) that celebrates Telegram’s technological advancements and innovation history relative to WhatsApp. Key aspects of the contest include:Telegram provides participants with a curated list of 30 key features that the app introduced before WhatsApp adopted similar functionalities. However, Pavel Durov notes that the list is not exhaustive and that many. Telegram features still have no counterparts on WhatsApp.Telegram has long promoted its role as an innovator in the messaging app industry. The platform introduced a variety of features now commonplace in WhatsApp and other competitors, including:This innovation-driven branding underpins Telegram’s appeal to privacy-conscious users, tech enthusiasts, and developers worldwide.The contest arrives at a time when Telegram is increasingly positioning itself as a privacy-focused alternative to mainstream messaging apps. This strategy is part of a broader trend among users concerned about data privacy, censorship, and control over digital communication platforms.Simultaneously, Telegram’s open nature and support for bots and APIs have made it popular among developers and businesses seeking customizable communication tools. The contest, therefore, not only serves marketing objectives but also reinforces Telegram’s identity as a technology leader.In conjunction with the contest announcement, Pavel Durov addressed additional political pressures Telegram faces globally. On his Telegram channel, he claimed that a Western European government (implied to be France) had requested Telegram to silence conservative political voices in Romania ahead of the country’s presidential elections held on May 18, 2025. Durov stated that Telegram refused the request, emphasizing the platform’s commitment to protecting political freedom and user rights without blocking political channels.This statement underscores Telegram’s stance on political neutrality and freedom of expression, positioning the platform as resistant to government censorship demands.The contest opens opportunities for a wide range of content creators, including video producers, social media influencers, and digital marketers. By incentivizing creative promotion of Telegram’s features, the company aims to increase its user base and engagement on emerging social media platforms, where short-form videos dominate.Participants are encouraged to leverage contemporary digital marketing techniques, meme culture, and AI tools to maximize video reach and impact. The contest guidelines emphasize the importance of clear messaging, visual appeal, and potential for viral spread.The submitted videos will be reviewed and scored based on predefined metrics by Telegram’s evaluation panel, with winners announced in June 2025. This approach highlights Telegram’s commitment to community-driven content creation as part of its marketing and brand positioning strategy.If successful, the contest could set a precedent for future content initiatives designed to engage users creatively, leveraging social media trends to amplify Telegram’s messaging about innovation and privacy.",Telegram CEO Pavel Durov launches $50K viral video contest to expose WhatsApp’s ‘cheap copycat’ moves.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Google’s Sundar Pichai calls R1 ‘impressive’

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has praised the Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) startup DeepSeek’s flagship model, R1, saying that it is the first large language model (LLM) that he’s seen to rival OpenAI’s performance – essentially keeping it on a higher pedestal than Google’s Gemini and the one that powers Grok, the AI chatbot by Elon Musk’s AI company, xAI.“OpenAI has been so far ahead that no one's really come close,” Satya Nadella told Bloomberg Businessweek.“DeepSeek, and R1 in particular, was the first model I’ve seen post some points,” added Nadella.Microsoft began offering R1 through its Azure AI Foundry in January, alongside models from OpenAI, Meta and Mistral. Microsoft VP Asha Sharma said R1 underwent “rigorous red teaming and safety evaluations” before being made available, and emphasized that data processed through Azure would not be routed to DeepSeek’s servers in China.DeepSeek made waves earlier this year when it launched R1, impressing both the tech industry and investors. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman acknowledged the competition, calling R1 “an impressive model” and noting its strong performance at a lower cost. He added that DeepSeek’s emergence prompted OpenAI to accelerate some product releases.Even Google CEO Sundar Pichai acknowledged the ‘impressive work’ of DeepSeek's team Alphabet’s Q4 2024 earnings call earlier this year.“I think [DeepSeek has] a tremendous team. I think they've done very, very good work,” Pichai said.R1’s popularity surged in January when its free chatbot app topped Apple’s US App Store, sparking concerns among investors about potential impacts on demand for AI hardware like Nvidia chips. DeepSeek’s ability to deliver high-quality models at a lower price triggered a sell-off in AI-related stocks.However, Ben Buchanan, an AI advisor in the former US President Joe Biden administration, suggested that the hype may be exxagerated and overstated.“DeepSeek’s engineers are extremely talented,” he said on The Ezra Klein Show, adding that their breakthroughs are largely in line with algorithmic efficiency work seen across the industry.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says DeepSeek's R1 is the first large language model (LLM) that he's seen to rival OpenAI's performance.

Aaron Rodgers ’ signing delay sparks Steelers QB concerns



Is Aaron Rodgers avoiding Pittsburgh Steelers’ offseason program? | Pro Football Talk | NFL on NBC

Kirk Cousins could be Pittsburgh’s unexpected solution



Pittsburgh Steelers fans have been waiting patiently, maybe too patiently, for some clarity at quarterback this offseason. With the team still without a signed starter, and training camp quickly approaching, frustration is bubbling beneath the surface. Aaron Rodgers , the name everyone hoped would bring stability and experience, remains in limbo. His silence and hesitation have left many wondering if he’s really committed to the Steelers or just keeping them on the hook. Meanwhile, another familiar name, Kirk Cousins , has quietly entered the conversation as a potential backup option.It’s no secret that Rodgers hasn’t officially signed with Pittsburgh, and that’s causing some serious doubt. Sources say Rodgers has told the Steelers he plans to play but only once some “personal issues” are settled, possibly by the end of May. The vague timing and lack of a firm commitment have made fans and analysts alike question whether Rodgers is truly ready to jump back in or if he’s dragging his feet.Former NFL wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson summed it up bluntly: if Rodgers misses the offseason workouts, it signals a lack of seriousness about both football and his teammates. And in a city like Pittsburgh, where football is almost a religion, that’s a tough pill to swallow.While Aaron Rodgers remains uncertain about his future with the Steelers, Kirk Cousins is quietly making a case for himself. Currently the backup quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons, Cousins is reportedly looking for a fresh start after Michael Penix Jr. was named the Falcons’ starter. For Pittsburgh, Cousins could bring much-needed veteran leadership and help steady their unsettled quarterback situation.There is one major downside: signing Cousins would come with a significant financial commitment over $20 million in guaranteed money. But if Rodgers keeps delaying his decision, the Steelers may have no choice but to take that risk.Also Read: Tony Romo calls Taylor Swift a “Positive Influence” on Travis Kelce After a tough season, Cousins is eager to prove he still has what it takes to compete in the NFL. With Pittsburgh’s passionate fans and proud football tradition, it could be the perfect place for him to make a comeback.","Pittsburgh Steelers fans have been waiting patiently, maybe too patiently, for some clarity at quarterback.

"Google unveils AI chatbot, signalling a new era for search",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/google-unveils-ai-chatbot-signalling-a-new-era-for-search/articleshow/121326870.cms,"Sundar Pichai, Google CE





MOUNTAIN VIEW: Google became the gateway to the internet by perfecting its search engine. For two decades, it surfaced 10 blue links that gave people access to the information they were looking for.But after a quarter century, the tech giant is betting that the future of search will be artificial intelligence. On Tuesday, Google said it was introducing a new feature in its search engine called AI Mode. The tool will function like a chatbot, allowing people to start a query, ask follow-up questions and use the company's AI system to deliver comprehensive answers.""It's a total reimagining of search,"" said Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, in a press briefing before the company's annual conference for software developers. In tests of the feature, he said people dramatically ""changed the nature of how they are interacting with search.""The new feature headlined a list of new AI abilities, including more personalised and automated email replies and a shopping tool to automatically purchase clothing after it's put on sale.With the introduction of AI Mode, Google is essentially trying to disrupt its traditional search business before upstart AI competitors can disrupt it. The search giant has been nervous about that possibility since declaring a ""code red"" two years ago after the arrival of ChatGPT, a chatbot from OpenAI that ignited a race to add generative AI into tech products.But Google has been hesitant to fully embrace AI because it has so much to lose. The company's search business generated nearly $200 billion last year, more than half of its total sales. And the bedrock of that business has been how it has reliably provided people with the best answers to questions.Though they are a technical leap, AI systems have one big shortcoming: They are prone to giving incorrect answers, like recommending people eat rocks, which one of Google's AI systems did last year.AI might have already begun to cut into Google's popularity as the default for finding digital information. During testimony in a justice department antitrust case against Google this May, one of Apple's top executives, Eddy Cue, said Google search traffic declined for the first time in 22 years because more people are using AI. Google said afterward that it continued to ""see overall query growth"" in search.""They hesitated on this for a long time because they didn't think the quality was good or know how to monetise it,"" said Pete Meyers, the principal innovation architect at Moz, a software company focused on search engine optimization that tracks changes to Google Search. ""Now they're doing what they think they have to do to compete, and it's uncomfortable."" AI Mode, which launched in the US on Tuesday, won't serve ads initially. Google is holding an event for marketers and advertisers on Wednesday where it could unveil more.","Google is introducing a new feature in its search engine called AI Mode.

But his lack of selfcontrol cost him his annual bonus/ NYT (Screengrab)





With a keen sense of smell and legs that seem too short for his body, Fu Zai has won a huge social media audience that has followed him doing official duties since he started as a sniffer dog last fall. He was a puppy when a trainer spotted him at a park and recruited him to Weifang Public Security Bureau in Shandong.A love of earning treats as rewards has earned Fu Zai strong performance reviews. But it’s also proved a challenge, as his trainer has found that keeping him in line is not easy.Fu Zai was caught on camera recently grabbing a bite of a sausage in a child’s hand during patrol. Officers have since tried to train him to better resist food, but many on social media offered support — and free sausages — for Fu Zai the next time he patrolled the streets. In another video, some of the corgi’s toys and snacks — part of a Lunar New Year “bonus”— were confiscated for sleeping on the job and using his bowl as a urinal. Experts said such behaviour is normal for corgis. “That’s why they’re challenging, too, because they get distracted pretty easily,” said Leonardo Palacio, owner of a training school in Connecticut.Fu Zai is an unusual choice for police work. Traditionally, corgis were bred to work on farms, herding cattle by biting their ankles.In recent times, they have become popular choices for pets, most famously associated with Queen Elizabeth II. But some have retained the propensity to nip. That trait might dissuade trainers when assessing the suitability of a dog for disciplined forces, said a trainer at Hong Kong Canine.Fu Zai’s trainer said he had initially ruled out a corgi as a police dog because of the breed’s reputation. Meeting Fu Zai changed his mind. He later invited Fu Zai to train at the police base. Over the next few months, the corgi excelled in detecting explosives. Moreover, he could fit under tight spaces some other dogs couldn’t reach.Fu Zai became a full-fledged member of Weifang police in Oct. He has since been beamed around the internet as a friendly face for the force, making frequent appearances on its official account on Douyin, China’s version of TikTok. A separate account, named “Fu Zai and his comrades,” has more than 400,000 followers. But the drive for food that helped him land the job also gotten him into some of his troubles. Whether as temptation he can’t resist or a treat used in training, there will probably be more sausage in Fu Zai’s future.","Fu Zai was a puppy when a trainer spotted him at a park and recruited him to Weifang Public Security Bureau in Shandong.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

EPF withdrawal: What happens to interest?



EPF withdrawal claim : When it comes to claiming withdrawals from the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), many members are finding the process slower than expected, states an ET report. Members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts. Some are concerned because they haven't received any updates since filing their claims, the report claimed.Some EPF members used social media to ask questions and complain to get the EPFO 's attention. In response to most questions about claim updates, the EPFO's official account stated, “Dear member, normally it takes 20 days to settle a claim or release the PF amount.”If your EPF claim isn't settled within 20 days, you should file a complaint with the EPFO. The EPFO explained in response to a tweet from an EPF subscriber, “Dear member, kindly register your grievance on http://epfigms.gov.in and you can track your grievance status at http://epfigms.gov.in”To avoid delays, make sure to:1.Choose the appropriate form for your type of claim. The paperwork for EPF account transfer is different from that for EPF withdrawal.2.Ensure you meet the requirements for EPF withdrawal. Different rules apply for different types of claims, such as PF advances, final settlements, and other reasons.3.Fill out the form carefully and ensure all information is correct. Attach any required documents, like a cancelled cheque, ID proof, address proof, or other relevant documents.4.Make sure your Know Your Customer (KYC) data, such as Aadhaar, PAN, and bank account details, are up-to-date and linked to your EPF account.5.Confirm that your nomination information is current and your member profile is updated.Before you file an EPF claim, ensure that you've checked and resolved the following:- Correct mismatch in name- Correct mismatch in date of birth- Use the correct application form- Complete KYC- Avoid joint bank accounts- Correct bank account errors- Verify the date of joining and leaving- Link UAN with AadhaarYou can withdraw from your EPF account either entirely or in parts. After you retire or if you're unemployed for over two months, you can take out all of your EPF savings. However, you can also make partial withdrawals under specific conditions. According to the EPFO, you won't lose any interest because it's calculated according to the policy.This means that EPF members will not lose any interest due to the withdrawal process. The interest is calculated from when it's due until the day you withdraw your money. If you withdraw before the interest is officially credited, it will still be added to your account.","EPF members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

xAI’s Grok 3 AI models now available on Microsoft Azure

Technical insights into Grok 3.5

Significance of the Microsoft-xAI collaboration

Free access to Grok AI on Azure available this June

Future outlook and industry impact

Also read | Elon Musk under fire: Senators demand investigation into Starlink trade deals

In a notable event at the Microsoft Build 2025 developer conference, Elon Musk , CEO of xAI and Tesla, joined Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella to announce the integration of xAI’s flagship Grok 3 AI models on Microsoft Azure. This announcement marks a significant step in the evolving artificial intelligence landscape, bringing together two major technology powerhouses. The Grok models will be accessible for free throughout June on the Azure AI Foundry platform, which also features AI offerings from industry leaders such as OpenAI, Meta, and Hugging Face.This collaboration highlights not only technological innovation but also the historical ties between Musk and Microsoft, recalling Musk’s early programming days as a Microsoft intern. This detailed report covers all aspects of the announcement, the technology behind Grok, the significance of this partnership, and the future prospects of AI development on Azure.During the Build conference, Satya Nadella took a moment to reflect on Elon Musk’s early career. Nadella reminded the audience of Musk’s internship at Microsoft, stating,Musk responded warmly, sharing memories of his beginnings before Windows with MS-DOS on the earliest IBM PCs. He highlighted the technological limitations of that era, recalling how memory upgrades from 128k to 256k were significant milestones. Musk also described programming video games in DOS and later working with Windows 3.1, emphasizing his foundational experience in software development which shaped his future ventures.The core of the announcement focused on the launch of Grok 3, xAI’s advanced family of AI models, now integrated with Microsoft Azure’s cloud infrastructure. Nadella introduced Grok as “a family of models that are both responsive and capable of reasoning,” expressing enthusiasm about its deployment on Azure AI Foundry, Microsoft’s AI platform that offers scalable, managed AI services to developers and enterprises worldwide.The availability of Grok 3 and Grok 3 Mini on Azure aims to broaden access to cutting-edge AI capabilities. Microsoft will provide these models with service-level agreements consistent with their other AI offerings, and billing will be streamlined through Microsoft’s standard Azure framework. This ensures ease of integration for enterprises already operating within the Azure ecosystem.Elon Musk elaborated on the forthcoming Grok 3.5 model during the conversation. He described it as an AI designed to “reason from first principles,” a philosophical approach emphasizing fundamental truths and axioms as the basis for knowledge and problem-solving. Musk explained that the model’s architecture is grounded in fundamental physics, allowing it to apply these principles across different reasoning domains with an aim to minimize error and approach accurate understanding.This emphasis on physics-based reasoning sets Grok apart from many AI models that rely primarily on pattern recognition and statistical inference. By integrating first-principles reasoning, Grok 3.5 aspires to provide more reliable, consistent outputs, potentially enhancing applications across diverse fields such as autonomous vehicles, space exploration, and customer service.The integration of Grok into Azure represents a strategic alliance that leverages Microsoft’s extensive cloud infrastructure and xAI’s innovative AI research. This collaboration extends the reach of Musk’s xAI beyond standalone systems, embedding it within one of the largest and most trusted cloud platforms globally.Azure AI Foundry already hosts models from major AI developers like OpenAI, Meta, and Hugging Face, making it a hub for AI innovation and adoption. Grok’s addition to this ecosystem reflects Microsoft’s commitment to providing diverse AI options to developers and enterprises.The partnership also comes amid industry discussions regarding the influence of large tech firms on AI development. Musk’s previous criticisms of Microsoft’s role in OpenAI’s operations add a layer of complexity to this collaboration, underscoring the nuanced relationships shaping the AI industry.Microsoft announced that Grok models will be available free of charge throughout June, allowing developers, researchers, and businesses to explore and experiment with xAI’s technology. This limited free access serves to increase adoption and foster community feedback, critical for refining AI capabilities and expanding real-world applications.Post-June, Grok’s services will continue under Microsoft’s commercial terms, integrated fully within the Azure billing and support system. This seamless integration facilitates enterprise-grade deployment, enabling customers to incorporate Grok-powered AI into their existing workflows with minimal friction.The collaboration between Microsoft and xAI marks a pivotal moment in AI development, demonstrating the growing importance of cloud platforms as hubs for AI innovation and distribution. By combining xAI’s first-principles reasoning models with Microsoft’s global cloud reach, this partnership is poised to accelerate the deployment of advanced AI solutions across industries.As AI technologies continue to evolve rapidly, partnerships like this provide essential infrastructure and support for scalable AI applications in sectors such as automotive, aerospace, healthcare, and customer experience. The free access period in June offers the broader tech community an opportunity to assess Grok’s capabilities and potential impact.","Elon Musk, CEO of xAI and Tesla, joined Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella to announce the integration of x AI’s flagship Grok 3 AI models on Microsoft Azure.

According to NBA analyst Kevin O’Connor, White’s skill set aligns perfectly with the Warriors’ system, making him an ideal addition to their core.Derrick White’s versatility on both ends of the court has made him one of the league’s most underrated players. His ability to contribute as a shooter, playmaker, and elite defender makes him a seamless fit for Steve Kerr’s motion-heavy offense.Kevin O’Connor highlighted White’s value during The Kevin O’Connor Show : ""White would be a perfect fit for the Steve Kerr offense. His shooting ability, the high-IQ decision-making, the defense … Derrick White would be just glorious for the Golden State Warriors."" (H/t: Sporting News - Elite Perimeter Defense: One of the best guard defenders in the NBA.- Improved Three-Point Shooting: Evolved into a reliable outside threat.- High Basketball IQ: Makes smart decisions in transition and half-court sets.- Playoff Experience: Key contributor to the Celtics’ deep postseason runs.Despite the Warriors ’ potential interest, the Celtics have little incentive to move White. He’s widely regarded as the team’s second-most untouchable player behind Jayson Tatum.- Contract Stability: White is entering the first year of a four-year, $118 million extension.- Age & Growth: At 31, he’s still improving each season.- Team Success: A vital piece of Boston’s championship-contending roster.As O’Connor noted: ""Why would the Celtics trade Derrick White, who's only going to be 31, and still feels like he's getting better every year?""If Golden State pushes for a deal, they’ll need to offer significant draft capital to even get Boston’s attention.However, given White’s importance to the Celtics, any trade would likely require additional players or picks to make it feasible.While the Warriors see White as a ""glorious"" fit, prying him away from Boston remains a long shot. The Celtics value his two-way impact too highly, and unless Golden State overpays, White will likely stay put.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers could bag $29,936,173 Indiana Pacers rookie to bolster squad around LeBron James and Luka Doncic As the offseason unfolds, this potential storyline will be one to watch closely.",The Golden State Warriors are reportedly considering a bold move this offseason.

Minnesota Timberwolves guard Anthony Edwards

On May 22, 2025, the NBA officially announced thathas been fined $50,000 for using profane language during a postgame media interview. The incident took place after the Timberwolves suffered a crushing 114-88 defeat at the hands of the Oklahoma City Thunder in Game 1 of the Western Conference Finals. The league’s statement, released by NBA Communications and signed off by Byron Spruell, President of League Operations, did not specify the exact words used, but online reactions quickly filled in the blanks.According to one fan, Anthony Edwards ’ offense was uttering the word “f**king” during the postgame availability—a moment that clearly didn’t sit well with league officials but resonated with many fans frustrated with the team’s performance and the league’s disciplinary priorities.The backlash on social media was swift and laced with sarcasm. Verified user @BonesGotBizzy rhetorically asked, “how much is this fine for someone who works a 9-5?”, putting into perspective just how massive the $50,000 fine is for the average person. This comment highlights a recurring sentiment among fans: the financial penalties handed down to NBA stars often seem disconnected from the economic realities of the general public.Another fan, @Stitch379464652, didn’t hold back either, calling the league “so sorry it’s pathetic,” expressing disillusionment over what they see as excessive control over players’ expression. Meanwhile, others mocked the NBA’s sensitivity, with comments like “Soft ass fines,” pointing to what they perceive as the league’s overreaction to a moment of postgame emotion.The incident also reignites the ongoing debate over freedom of expression in professional sports. While the NBA has historically encouraged players to speak out on social and political issues, moments of raw emotion—especially following a blowout playoff loss—continue to be policed with financial consequences.Anthony Edwards, one of the league’s most electric young stars, has consistently worn his heart on his sleeve. While the fine may not impact his wallet significantly, it has clearly struck a nerve with fans who view the punishment as another example of the league being out of touch.Also read: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander’s New Deal With OKC Thunder Could Bank Him $1 Million…PER GAME With Game 2 looming, all eyes will be on Anthony Edwards—not just for his performance, but to see if this controversy fuels his fire on the court.","Minnesota Timberwolves guard Anthony Edwards has been fined $50,000 for using profane language during a postgame media interview.
