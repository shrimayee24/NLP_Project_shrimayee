How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification







Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Why conflict over Apple CarPlay Ultra

Apple's Secret 3-Year Plan: A New iPhone Era is Coming!





Ford CEO Jim Farley has joined a list of auto makers who are raising concerns about Apple’s expanding control over in-car systems through its new CarPlay Ultra platform. “We don’t like the execution of Ultra in round one,” Farley told The Verge, adding “I’ve talked to Tim [Cook] many times about this. Ford does not have the right, in our opinion, to disrupt someone’s digital life when they get in their car”.Farley further warned that Apple needs to make a decision on how much it wants to encroach into a vehicle system. “How far do you want the Apple brand to go? Do you want the Apple brand to start the car? Do you want the Apple brand to limit the speed? Do you want the Apple brand to limit access?”, a furious Farley question.“The difference between car companies where you have a software-defined vehicle is not going to be what your sheet metal looks like. It won’t be how powerful your EV motor is. That’s all math. All the cars look nice. It’s going to be this digital experience that says why someone buys this or that,” he further said.Introduced earlier this year, Apple CarPlay Ultra is the latest generation of CarPlay, enabling iPhone users to display car functions like fuel level and speed.Other than mirroring iPhone’s screen, CarPlay also lets drivers control the air conditioning, radio, and driving modes, all from the same screen.Currently, only Aston Martin is the only automaker that has fully integrated CarPlay Ultra into its vehicles. According to a Financial Times report, other automakers, including Audi, Mercedes-Benz, Polestar, Volvo, Renault, and others have no plans to integrate the new system into their cars.But the conflict heated up when General Motors (GM) CEO Mary Barra said the company’s future vehicles will no longer support Apple CarPlay or its Google counterpart, Android Auto.","Ford CEO Jim Farley has joined a list of auto makers who are raising concerns about Apple’s expanding control over in-car systems through its new CarPlay Ultra platform. “We don’t like the execution of Ultra in round one,” Farley said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125135370,imgsize-30830,width-400,resizemode-4/ford-ceo-jim-farley.jpg"

Innovation has always been humanity’s greatest strength, from the wheel to the web, from the first flight to artificial intelligence. Each breakthrough has brought us closer to solving challenges once thought impossible. Yet today, even as we innovate faster than ever before, many great ideas never reach their full potential. They sit on shelves, locked behind walls of competition and protectionism, unable to make the difference they were designed for.At the heart of this paradox lies how innovation is often managed and protected. A patent, as defined by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), is an exclusive right granted for an invention, giving its holder the power to decide how others can use it for a limited period. In theory, patents reward creativity and encourage new ideas. But too often, they also create barriers, slowing down progress when world-changing inventions remain inaccessible to others who could adapt or expand them for wider benefit.History offers powerful reminders of what happens when those walls are broken. In 1959, Volvomade its three-point seatbelt patent available to everyone, a decision that has since saved more than a million lives. Decades later, the open release of the World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Leeallowed knowledge to travel freely, transforming how the world learns and connects. And when scientists shared COVID-19 vaccine researchacross borders, the result was one of the fastest and most collaborative scientific achievements in human history.Each of these moments teaches us one truth: when knowledge flows freely, progress follows. Today, as industries race to tackle climate change and resource scarcity, that same spirit of openness could be the catalyst our planet urgently needs.It is this very belief that innovation should be shared for the greater good, inspiring the creation of The Patent Bay, a bold step toward reimagining how technology and collaboration can work hand in hand. The platform flips the traditional model of competition on its head. Instead of protecting sustainability-driven patents within corporate walls, it opens them up to the world, inviting engineers, researchers, start-ups, and even competitors to access, use, and build upon them freely.At its heart lies a simple yet powerful question: What if the world’s most transformative ideas were allowed to flow freely, instead of gathering dust on a shelf? The Patent Bay exists to answer that, creating a digital hub where shared innovation becomes a collective force for progress.As SKF’s CEO, Rickard Gustafsson, puts it, “”. He further added, “, says Rickard Gustafsson.That philosophy comes to life through the platform’s first shared patent, ARCTIC15, a next-generation steel alloy developed by SKF’s research team. This groundbreaking material can make aircraft engines more fuel-efficient, helping reduce aviation emissions by up to 25%. Beyond aviation, its potential extends to electric vehicles, renewable energy, and manufacturing, proof that a single shared innovation can ignite change across entire industries.Much like the release of the seatbelt, the birth of the internet, or the open sharing of vaccine research, ARCTIC15 stands as proof that openness multiplies impact. By making this breakthrough alloy freely available, SKF shows that progress grows exponentially when innovation is unbound by ownership. This embodies the true spirit of The Patent Bay, not just a repository of ideas, but a living movement that helps solutions evolve beyond their origins. Through its open platform, patents become catalysts for collaboration, accelerating sustainable technologies, reducing time to innovation, and unlocking creativity across sectors. Every idea shared becomes a stepping stone for another, creating ripples of progress that stretch across industries and borders.Through The Patent Bay, SKF is doing more than sharing technology, it is sharing possibilities. The initiative reflects a belief that progress should not be confined to one company or one industry but spread across a global community of thinkers, builders, and dreamers. By positioning itself as a leader in sustainability and innovation, SKF is showing that the future belongs to those who choose collaboration over competition.The message is simple but powerful: we move faster when we move together. The Patent Bay is more than a platform; it is an open invitation calling on businesses, researchers, and innovators everywhere to join this movement to unlock ideas that can shape a cleaner, smarter, and more sustainable future.Because when innovation is shared, it doesn’t just change industries; it changes lives.","The Patent Bay is a digital hub where shared innovation becomes a collective force for progress.

Q: How much time should I be dedicating to career cushioning?

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Turns out, Japan’s streets are so clean that you could practically—or, at least, walk barefoot without regretting it. One Japanese influencer decided to put Tokyo to the ultimate test by strolling around the city in nothing but plain white socks. Yes, socks. Outside. For ten whole minutes.The simple experiment captured the attention of millions online and prompted widespread praise for Japan’s civic responsibility and culture of cleanliness.“One of my favourite countries for this reason,” one user commented, while another wrote, “Try that at 3 am before the trucks come to clean everything.

Residents are known to carry their trash home and maintain strict cleanliness habits, reflecting deep-rooted social values rather than strict enforcement.The influencer’s viral test has become symbolic of Japan’s collective civic sense, inspiring global audiences to consider how cleanliness depends more on community behaviour than on infrastructure alone.","Tokyo is often cited as one of the cleanest cities in the world despite the absence of public dustbins in many areas.

Banality of evil: German nurse kills 10 patients,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/banality-of-evil-german-nurse-kills-10-patients-to-reduce-workload/articleshow/125132828.cms,"



It sounds like a line from a Kafka play rewritten by Kafka’s nurse. A man whose job was to ease suffering decided the easiest way to do that was to remove the sufferer entirely.According to a BBC report, a palliative care nurse in Germany has been sentenced to life in prison for murdering 10 patients and attempting to kill 27 others. His motive? Not money. Not mercy. Just the mundane — to lighten his workload during overnight shifts.Between December 2023 and May 2024, this nameless nurse — anonymous by law, infamous by act — played God with a syringe. Prosecutors said he injected elderly patients with morphine and midazolam, not to relieve their pain but to make his rounds quieter, his night easier, his burden lighter. He showed, the court heard, “irritation” at those who demanded too much care — as if suffering were an inconvenience on the shift roster.The court in Aachen called it a crime of “particular severity of guilt,” ensuring he will never walk free again. But what’s truly chilling is not just the scale of his actions — it’s their ordinariness. A man trained since 2007 to heal became, by 2024, an executioner in scrubs, armed not with malice but with indifference.Investigators are now exhuming more bodies, probing whether this was just the visible tip of a career-long pattern.If confirmed, he could rival the grim legacy of Niels Högel — the German nurse sentenced in 2019 for killing 85 patients in northern hospitals between 1999 and 2005. Högel wanted to play hero: inject, cause cardiac arrest, then resuscitate — a perverse performance of saviourhood.This new killer? He wanted peace and quiet.That’s the most terrifying part. Evil, it turns out, doesn’t always come snarling. Sometimes it sighs, glances at the clock, and reaches for the morphine. It isn’t ideological or even sadistic — just tired, overworked, and catastrophically devoid of empathy.In that sense, this case isn’t only about a man who murdered ten people. It’s about the slow erosion of compassion in systems that reduce care to shift patterns and metrics. When life becomes data, death becomes a shortcut.Germany has seen this before. It will see it again. Because as Hannah Arendt might have said of this nurse, it wasn’t the devil in him that killed those patients — it was the paperwork.","A palliative care nurse in Germany has been sentenced to life in prison for murdering 10 patients and attempting to kill 27 others.

Social media: Extreme positions and vocal minorities get most attention





EU's Digital Services Act offers glimmer of hope





Finland promotes media literacy from kindergarten









In January 2025, Elon Musk conducted an interview on X with Alice Weidel, the leader of Germany's far-right AfD party, some regional branches of which are considered right-wing extremist by German intelligence services.""Only the AfD can save Germany. End of story,"" he said in an undisguised interference by a powerful social network in Germany's election campaign.In Romania in 2024, the far-right presidential candidate Calin Georgescu won the first round of the elections to the surprise of many: The political outsider had not participated in any TV debates and had not invested any money in his campaign. His success came mainly through the video platform TikTok; his videos were very prominent in the feeds of many Romanians.Suspicions quickly arose that social bots (automated accounts) and trolls (human users who are sometimes paid to act on behalf of a foreign body or government agency) must have been involved. The election was annulled. It is also known that bots and trolls have been used to manipulate public opinion in many other digital discussions and topics, such as Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic.What happens in the digital sphere can have a huge influence on public opinion.At a conference entitled ""Big Tech and digital democracy: How much regulation does public discourse need?"" organized by DW and the University of Cologne as part of a series of events on Global Media Law, media and constitutional law expert Dieter Dörr stated that ""democracy is under serious threat.""Established and respected media outlets are present on these platforms and use Instagram, YouTube and others as channels for their content. But there are also numerous other players. They don't even have to be bots or trolls: There are many accounts that do not maintain certain standards, andincite hatred against others, spread false claims or use artificial intelligence (AI) to manipulate and generate images and videos.The algorithms used by social media to decide what content is displayed when and shown to whom reward this kind of behavior.""Extreme opinions, which have a wide-reaching scope, are pushed to the top,"" said Dörr, explaining that this is what keeps users on platforms for longer, allowing for more money to be earned from them.Social media platforms have become an important, if not the only, source of information for many people. Politicians and researchers have long recognized that the power wielded by these platforms is a problem. But can anything be done about it?The European Union (EU) has stepped up efforts in recent years to regulate the digital world, primarily through its Digital Services Act (DSA), which came into force in February 2024. It requires major online platforms and search engines such as Amazon, Google, X and Facebook to provide greater transparency and protection for users.Renate Nikolay, the deputy director-general of the Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology (DG CONNECT) at the European Commission, which is responsible for enforcing the Digital Services Act, says: ""We are pursuing three principles: First, platforms must assess and minimize systemic risks. Second, we are strengthening users' rights, for example by providing complaint mechanisms. Third, we demand transparency in algorithms and require platforms to give researchers access to their data.""This sounds like a big step forward: Platforms have to provide information on their algorithms and even offer users the option to disable personalized content or advertising. After all, algorithms tend not only to disadvantage moderate and differentiated content. Ultimately, they also create filter bubbles or echo chambers, in which users are mainly surrounded by content and other users that reflect their own views. This puts them at risk of falling into a spiral of radicalization.The TikTok algorithm is particularly notorious. A recent study by the University of Potsdam and the Bertelsmann Foundation showed that during the last German election campaign, political parties were not equally visible in the TikTok feeds of young users. Videos from official party accounts on the political fringes, especially the AfD, were played more frequently than those from the accounts of more centrist parties.During the period under review, the AfD uploaded 21.5% percent of all the videos, but these accounted for 37.4% of videos that appeared in feeds. The AfD's videos were therefore overrepresented. For its part, the center-right CDU/CSU party of Chancellor Friedrich Merz uploaded 17.1% of all party videos, but these accounted for only 4.9% of videos in feeds.When asked about this at the conference, Tim Klaws, Director of Government Relations and Public Policy for DACH, Israel and BeNeLux at TikTok, gave an evasive answer. He said that digital platforms had no interest in operating in an environment full of disinformation and populism, and were trying to minimize ""fake news"", hate speech, etc. with the help of AI and their staff members.Incidentally, apart from the DSA, there are other laws that regulate digital platforms, such as the European Media Freedom Act, which supplements the first by granting special status to recognized media outlets on large platforms — so that their content is treated transparently and cannot be removed without good reason.Something else that experts say is important besides regulation: media literacy. People need to understand digital media better and use them more responsibly. Ultimately, users are the ones who post, consume, share and comment on content.""Finland is exemplary in this regard, and we can learn something from them,"" says Nikolay.Indeed, Finland has put in place a national strategy to promote media literacy, which starts as early as kindergarten and has resulted in Finns being very good at critically examining content and recognizing disinformation.Only a combination of all the available measures can combat social media influence and online manipulation. But some experts such as Dörr remain skeptical: ""There's not much that can be done against this tsunami."" Particularly considering the fact that new challenges are constantly emerging, such as AI chatbots that provide false or biased information.At the end of the DW conference, Nikolay made it clear that Europe was not ""against the platforms,"" but wanted to work with them to ""change business models so that they promote democracy rather than endanger it.""She said that one example of good cooperation was this year's parliamentary elections in Moldova. In the run-up to the polls, EU representatives, the Moldovan authorities, civil society actors and the operators of platforms such as Google, Meta, and TikTok had sat down together to counter disinformation and protect the electoral process.This was apparently successful: A Russian disinformation campaign against the pro-European ruling Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) did not have a decisive impact on the election results. PAS emerged as the election winner.","Social media platforms have become an important, if not the only, source of information for many people. Politicians and researchers have long recognized that the power wielded by these platforms is a problem. EU has stepped up efforts in recent years to regulate the digital world.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125182200,imgsize-434788,width-400,resizemode-4/image-2025-11-08t144738654.jpg"
UAE records lowest temperature of the season at 9.8°C in Al Ain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-records-lowest-temperature-of-the-season-at-9-8c-in-al-ain/articleshow/125197252.cms,"Raknah, Al Ain recorded 9.8°C Sunday morning, the UAE’s lowest seasonal temperature, NCM confirmed/Representative Image

Today’s cold snap





Historical context





Winter in the UAE





Implications and observations





Daily life: Cooler mornings may require warmer clothing, while daytime conditions remain comfortable.

Travel and tourism: Early-morning temperatures in places like Al Ain and Ras Al Khaimah could affect outdoor activities, especially in desert or mountainous regions.

Agriculture: Frost-sensitive crops in elevated areas might need extra protection during these cold snaps.





The UAE woke up to a chilly start Sunday as temperatures in Raknah, Al Ain, plunged to 9.8°C, the lowest of the season so far, signaling the arrival of winter across the Emirates, the National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) reportedAt 6:30am UAE local time, the mercury dropped to 9.8°C in Raknah, Al Ain, marking the coldest reading in the country today. The NCM confirmed this figure, emphasizing that winter in the UAE brings milder conditions compared to the scorching summer months.Typical winter daytime temperatures range between 15°C and 25°C, offering a welcome relief for residents and visitors alike. However, early mornings and elevated areas often experience significantly cooler temperatures.While today’s low is notable, it is far from the UAE’s all-time record. On February 3, 2017, temperatures in the country plunged to -5.7°C at Jebel Jais, the nation’s highest peak located around 25 kilometres from Ras Al Khaimah City. This remains the coldest temperature ever officially recorded in the UAE.For the current year, 2025, the lowest recorded temperature prior to today was 1.9°C on January 4 at Jebel Jais, following a 2.2°C reading the day before. These figures illustrate the pattern of early-morning chills in mountainous areas, even as daytime temperatures remain moderate.The UAE’s winter season, which typically runs from November to March, is characterized by cooler mornings, mild days, and relatively low humidity levels. While daytime temperatures in most urban and coastal areas stay between 15°C and 25°C, residents in desert regions or high-altitude locations may experience sharp dips in temperature overnight, particularly during the colder months.The NCM continues to monitor these fluctuations closely, issuing guidance for residents to prepare for colder mornings and potential weather-related impacts, particularly in elevated or exposed areas.Today’s 9.8°C reading in Raknah is a reminder that while UAE winters are mild compared to many countries, early-morning chills can still be significant, especially in inland and mountainous locations","The UAE woke up to a chilly start Sunday as temperatures in Raknah, Al Ain, plunged to 9.8°C, the lowest of the season so far.

“She wasn’t even looking at the road for 90% of the video,”

“Someone’s going to get seriously hurt if this keeps being allowed.”

“It’s only a matter of time before a platform has to deal with a serious tragedy,”





A Kick streamer known as Jackie has reportedly been involved in a car accident while broadcasting live, allegedly after getting distracted by her chat. A viral clip circulating on Reddit and X (formerly Twitter) shows Jackie driving at night, glancing repeatedly at her phone while responding to viewers’ comments. Moments later, a sudden jolt and camera shake are seen before the stream abruptly cuts off. While details about the extent of damage or possible injuries remain unclear, the footage has raised major concerns about streaming safety on the road.The video quickly spread across social media, amassing thousands of reactions and reigniting conversations about the risks of livestreaming while driving. Fans and fellow streamers have called the situation alarming, noting that IRL (in-real-life) content has become increasingly dangerous as creators push boundaries for engagement. Kick has yet to issue a statement regarding the clip or whether any disciplinary action will be taken.The clip first surfaced on, where users flooded the comments with criticism toward Jackie’s actions.One viewer wrote,while another said,Others pointed out that such stunts reflect poorly on streaming platforms, arguing that both Kick and Twitch need stricter enforcement of safety guidelines.Several users compared the situation to past incidents where creators faced backlash for livestreaming while driving.one commenter noted. Despite the growing outrage, some defended Jackie, claiming she may have been momentarily distracted rather than intentionally reckless, though most agreed the footage looked concerning.If confirmed, Jackie’s alleged car crash serves as another warning against the dangers of distracted livestreaming. As IRL content continues to blur the line between entertainment and risk, streaming platforms face increasing pressure to act. Whether Kick responds with stricter policies or creators take accountability themselves, the message remains clear — no interaction or clip is worth jeopardizing safety on the road.Also Read: Sneako hilariously narrates how Zohran Mamdani met his wife in viral clip","A Kick streamer known as Jackie has reportedly been involved in a car accident while broadcasting live, allegedly after getting distracted by her chat.

Saudi launches Self-Deportation platform and AI smart track for faster airport immigration processing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/saudi-launches-self-deportation-platform-and-ai-smart-track-for-faster-airport-immigration-processing/articleshow/125178064.cms,"Saudi digitises deportation and travel checks with AI systems / AI-generated image

Deportation goes digital

The platform lets the user submit required exit paperwork and verification online.

Launch timing: the platform will be rolled out “shortly” after technical and security checks are completed (no firm public date was given).

Smart track and AI identity verification

The future of Airport queues

The Smart Track System: This innovative track will allow travelers to pass through immigration controls where their identities are verified solely via advanced smart cameras. Crucially, these cameras are capable of verifying the identities of up to 35 people simultaneously. This unprecedented speed means passengers can complete their entry or exit procedures without needing to interact with a passport control officer, drastically cutting down processing time.

Digital Twins Technology: Tested successfully during the Hajj season of 1445 AH (2024), this system relies on complex models and data analysis. This provides real-time insights into crucial operational metrics, including:



Analyzing crowd movement patterns within terminals. Accurately calculating passenger waiting times at passport control areas. Continuously monitoring passenger satisfaction with the services provided.



The Absher ecosystem

Digital Passport and International Cooperation: The digital passport is already available on the Absher platform, simplifying international travel procedures for beneficiaries. Jawazat is actively working to conclude international agreements with other countries to ensure the acceptance and expansion of this digital passport for global travel.

and International Cooperation: The digital passport is already available on the Absher platform, simplifying international travel procedures for beneficiaries. Jawazat is actively working to conclude international agreements with other countries to ensure the acceptance and expansion of this digital passport for global travel. A Unified Gateway for Data: To improve security and facilitate international transit, the Jawazat has serious plans to establish a ""unified gateway between countries"" for the exchange of passenger data. This system will be secured through formal agreements, ensuring that passenger data is streamlined as soon as they transit through the Kingdom to other international destinations.

Service Accessibility: The Absher platform currently offers more than 100 digital services, which benefited over 24 million users in the year 2024 alone. Jawazat has also introduced the ""Smart Voice Agent"" service, available 24/7 by calling the number 992, providing immediate assistance to users without the need for direct employee intervention.





Acting Director General of Passports (Jawazat), Maj. Gen. Saleh Al-Murabba, announced at the Digital Government Forum 2025 in Riyadh that the directorate will shortly roll out a Self-Deportation Platform to let people who are in the Kingdom illegally complete departure procedures online. He also unveiled a Smart Track system that uses smart cameras and AI to verify identities and process groups of travellers, potentially eliminating the need for routine passport-control staff at some checkpoints.The Self-Deportation Platform is an online portal designed to replace manual, paper-heavy deportation practices. According to the announcement, once security and technical preparations are completed, individuals identified as violators of residency, labour or border rules will be able to access the platform, complete travel documentation and finalise their exit without in-person processing. The move is framed as both an efficiency and a modernisation step, shifting a time-consuming administrative task into a secure digital flow.Key practical points reported so far:Smart Track is the complementary system for major travel hubs. It uses advanced smart cameras and AI technology to check identities and can reportedly verify up to 35 people at once, allowing essential travel procedures to complete smoothly without an individual passport-control officer present.The system aims to efficiently accelerate passenger flow at airports and other checkpoints by intelligently automating identity verification and cross-checking against vital security databases. Officials say the innovative technology will be introduced once integration with Jawazat security systems is fully completedFor travelers passing through the Kingdom’s ports, two major technological leaps are set to eliminate slow-moving lines and long waiting times:Furthermore, departure procedures are being streamlined to a great extent. By linking technical and security systems to smart devices and digital cameras for automated verification, the traditional requirement of passing through passport control at departure lounges will be eliminated, creating a seamless boarding experience.The push for digitalization extends beyond the airport floor and into the wider administrative ecosystem, with the Absher platform at the center of innovation:Saudi Arabia's commitment to these digital reforms, anchored by the launch of the Self-Deportation Platform and the AI-driven Smart Track system, clearly signals a new and transformative era. By transforming its ports into smart, efficient gateways and streamlining administrative services through cutting-edge technology, the Kingdom is solidifying its position as a leader in digital government, ensuring faster travel, seamless security, and a radically improved experience for all who enter or exit its borders.","Self-Deportation Platform to let people who are in the Kingdom illegally complete departure procedures online.

"UAE debuts VR reconstruction of Makkah and Madina from the Prophet’s era, rendered in amazing detail",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-debuts-vr-reconstruction-of-makkah-and-madina-from-the-prophets-era-rendered-in-amazing-detail/articleshow/125124834.cms,"At Sharjah Book Fair, visitors wearing VR headsets explore ancient Makkah streets and the Holy Kaaba/Representative Image

Reconstructing the streets of ancient Makkah





Witnessing the birth of a community





Madina and the principles of early islam





An educational and emotional experience









Visitors to the Sharjah International Book Fair are now able to experience the heart of early Islam as never before. A new virtual reality (VR) installation, developed by Ana Al Madina, transports participants more than 1,400 years back in time, offering an immersive encounter with the streets, homes, and spiritual landmarks of Makkah and Madina. The experience blends meticulous historical reconstruction with advanced VR technology, allowing users to witness the life, culture, and transformative events of the Prophet Muhammad’s era in vivid, almost tangible detail.The VR journey begins in the very heart of pre-Islamic Makkah, the city of the Prophet’s birth. Participants descend through space before landing in a bustling metropolis, where narrow alleys and open markets unfold around them. Rough stones form the Kaaba, surrounded by the idols that once stood there. Traders sell goods, residents move through crowded streets, and the narration provides insight into daily life, including social norms and the position of women and young girls prior to Islam.The simulation then leads viewers through the early life of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Key moments include his spiritual retreat in the Cave of Hira, where Angel Jibreel revealed the first message of Islam.The visual and auditory elements are designed to create an overwhelming sense of presence, with visitors often instinctively reaching toward the cave walls as if to confirm the reality of the experience.Dr Adil Abdul Qadir, Manager of Ana Al Madina, explained the intent behind the project: “This VR set is designed purely for educational purposes. People who experience it understand what Makkah and Madina were like 1,400 years ago—the culture, the lifestyle, and the way people interacted.”The simulation continues by showing the early Muslim armies forming in Makkah, followed by the city’s transformation after the spread of Islam. These sequences provide both historical context and emotional resonance, culminating in the transition to the modern-day Kaaba. At this stage, users can virtually step inside the Holy Kaaba itself, observing its structure, golden lamps, and the serenity that defines the sacred space. For many, the experience is profoundly moving.“The feeling of watching or experiencing this is amazing,” Dr Adil said. “Many people come out with tears in their eyes because it feels so real, as if they have truly travelled back in time. It helps them understand the message of peace and unity that the Prophet brought.”The VR journey then transports participants to Madina, highlighting the Prophet’s migration and the construction of Masjid Al Nabawi. Users catch glimpses of his home, community life, and the societal structures he established. The simulation emphasises the core values of early Islamic society: compassion, equality, and justice. Every visual and narrative element is designed to reinforce how these principles shaped both the community and the broader trajectory of Islam.Dr Adil summarised the broader purpose of the project: “This remarkable journey connects people to faith through deep knowledge. We want visitors not just to see history, but to truly feel it, to experience the timeless values that shaped our world.”The Ana Al Madina VR experience represents more than a technological marvel; it is also an educational tool and a profound spiritual bridge. By combining historical accuracy with immersive, narrative-rich storytelling, it allows users to actively engage with the earliest days of Islam in a way that is both intellectually enlightening and emotionally resonant. Visitors leave with a deeper understanding of Makkah and Madina’s rich heritage, the life of the Prophet, and the enduring moral values he imparted throughout history.","Ana Al Madina has created a virtual reality installation at Sharjah International Book Fair.

Jimmy Kimmel BREAKS SILENCE on His Suspension As He Takes a Brutal Swipe at Trump | WATCH

No word on when new episodes will resume





Viewers tuning in to Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Thursday night were surprised to see a rerun instead of the new episode that had been promoted. The show was scheduled to feature David Duchovny , Stranger Things actor Joe Keery and singer Madison Beer. No announcement was made before the change, which led to confusion and questions across social media.The only confirmation came from Madison Beer. She posted on Instagram that her appearance had been “rescheduled due to unforeseen circumstances.” Duchovny and Keery did not comment. The show’s official channels also remained silent, and ABC did not respond to requests for clarification.One viewer shared an email from the show’s audience department stating that the taping had been postponed and that tickets would be rebooked. Entertainment site LateNighter suggested the delay was due to a personal matter concerning Kimmel, though no details were provided.This is the first unplanned change since Kimmel was briefly suspended in September after comments he made about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk drew backlash. He later apologised on-air. The incident caused tension between the host and the network, and the show has since struggled to regain stable ratings and advertiser confidence.As of Friday morning, there has been no update from Kimmel or ABC about when fresh episodes will return. The sudden silence has raised new questions about what is happening behind the scenes.","No announcement was made before the change, which led to confusion and questions across social media.

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.





When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has reacted sharply to Sam Altman ’s remarks about office productivity tools like Slack, saying that the ChatGPT-maker OpenAI will “compete directly with Microsoft”. Sam Altman, founder and CEO of OpenAI recently said that while there are many positives about Slack, it also creates a “lot of fake work”. In a now viral clip, Altman about how current workplace tools — such as Slack, Google Docs, email, and PowerPoint — may soon be replaced by a new generation of AI-driven systems.“There are positives about Slack,” Altman said, “but I kind of dread the first hour of the morning or last time before I go to bed, where I’m just dealing with this explosion of Slack. It creates a lot of fake work.”Altman added that he believes a new kind of AI-powered productivity platform is within reach — one where “your AI agent and my AI agent” will handle most communication and tasks, escalating only when necessary.Elon Musk, who has long been critical of OpenAI’s close partnership with Microsoft, responded on X (formerly known as Twitter) with a pointed remark: “As I was saying, OpenAI will compete directly with Microsoft.”The exchange comes as AI companies race to redefine workplace productivity. While Microsoft has heavily invested in “Copilot” features across its apps, Altman’s comments suggest OpenAI could be developing its own tools that may compete in the same space.In a recent post shared on X, Altman suggested that the company is planning another major new business venture, putting it in direct competition with cloud technology giants, including Google, Amazon and Microsoft.Altman wrote in the post: “We are also looking at ways to more directly sell compute capacity to other companies (and people); we are pretty sure the world is going to need a lot of 'AI cloud', and we are excited to offer this.”This means OpenAI could soon start selling cloud services, putting it in competition with established providers such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google Cloud. In September, OpenAI Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Sarah Friar made a similar point, suggesting that cloud providers had been “learning on our dime.” Her comment indicated that OpenAI was looking to safeguard its AI expertise from technology companies that may use its developments to advance their own capabilities.","Sam Altman, founder and CEO of OpenAI recently said that while there are many positives about Slack, it also creates a “lot of fake work” Elon Musk has reacted sharply to Altman ’s remarks about office productivity tools like Slack, saying that the ChatGPT-maker OpenAI will “compete directly with Microsoft”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125213222,imgsize-28312,width-400,resizemode-4/sam-altman-elon-musk.jpg"

Google CEO Sundar Pichai celebrates new breakthrough in quantum algorithm; Elon Musk replies: ‘Looks like…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-celebrates-new-breakthrough-in-quantum-algorithm-elon-musk-replies-looks-like/articleshow/124754841.cms,"



What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

This breakthrough is a significant step toward the first real-world application of quantum computing, and we're excited to see where it leads.”

Why Google’s Willow chip experiment matters

Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently shared a post on X, formerly Twitter, announcing a new breakthrough in quantum algorithms. “Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage,” Pichai wrote in the post, adding it is “13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers”. Pichai’s post caught the attention of Tesla CEO Elon Musk . The tech billionaire replied to Pichai’s post saying “Congrats. Looks like quantum computing is becoming relevant.”Announcing the major breakthrough, Google CEO Sundar Pichai wrote:The achievement marks a historic breakthrough in quantum computing.

Netflix has shut down the game studio Boss Fight Entertainment, the developer behind the hit mobile game Squid Game: Unleashed. The closure comes as the streaming giant pivots its strategy within its expanding video gaming unit, a report has said.The studio’s co-founder and former CEO, David Rippy, confirmed the closure in a LinkedIn post this week. He said that the studio is “very grateful for the time” it had at Netflix. Read Rippy’s full post on LinkedIn.Hi everyone – well, word has gotten around quickly about Boss Fight’s closure. Thanks, everyone who reached out today. Rough news, for sure, but I’m very grateful for the time we had at Netflix. We worked with some awesome people and made many games that I’m very proud of, including Squid Game Unleased which hit #1 in 26 countries. You’ll see lots of Boss Fighters with similar posts. Please consider them if you have any open roles – they are outstanding people and true professionals through-and-through. As for Bill, Scott and me – we’re going to take a little breather before tackling whatever is next. Love to hear from you if there’s anything interesting going on, workwise or otherwise.Another employee, David Luehmann, a director of game development at the studio, also posted on LinkedIn, saying, ""After 10+ great years working at Boss Fight, the last few as part of Netflix, the time has come for the studio to close down.""“I am very proud of all the people, work, and games we've released. I wish you could see what we had cooking! There are many talented people that have been impacted by this. If anyone is looking to grow, I'll have many recommendations for you!” he added.Netflix acquired Boss Fight Entertainment in 2022 as part of its effort to diversify revenue streams by building out its video game offerings, news agency Reuters reported.The studio was known for developing two games available on the platform: Netflix Stories and the highly successful Squid Game: Unleashed, which reportedly hit the number one spot in 26 countries.The streaming giant's move follows an earnings call earlier this week where Co-CEO Greg Peters specifically praised Squid Game: Unleashed as an example of the kind of narrative game the company wanted to create based on its original shows.However, the company, which named Alain Tascan as president of games last year, is implementing a new strategy that will focus on four specific categories: party, narrative, kids, and mainstream games, the report added. The studio’s closure signals a realignment of resources toward this updated focus.Despite the shutdown, Boss Fight's two games, Netflix Stories and Squid Game: Unleashed, will continue to be available on the Netflix platform.","Boss Fight Entertainment's co-founder and former CEO, David Rippy, confirmed the closure in a LinkedIn post this week.

One user wrote that deposits were not showing up and added that a “representative said all systems [are] down [and] have tech department working on it.”Another posted, “Cannot transfer funds and deposit is not showing.”A third complained about multiple failed attempts to make payments: “It’s showing the balance history from yesterday, it won’t allow mobile deposits, Zelle or transfers. I’m trying to pay someone, it’s not going well.I’ve been trying for 2 hours. I even updated my app.”Some users mentioned that while the mobile app wasn’t working, the web version seemed functional. “I have this issue too.

"Sam Altman and Sundar Pichai, Mark Zuckerberg says that like Meta's there is also 'problem' with your AI models; and he has fixed his",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/sam-altman-and-sundar-pichai-mark-zuckerberg-says-your-llms-are-problematic-like-metas-and-he-is-fixing-his/articleshow/125191400.cms,"Meta's blog post further goes on to explain how with LLM 4, Meta made improvements on these efforts and that LLM 4 performs significantly better than Llama 3 and is comparable to Grok. It says:





Facebook-parent Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg just said what many people have claimed about LLMs (AI models) -- that they are biased. Yes, whichi side the bias is -- Right or Left -- depends on which side one stands. However, for the first time ever, a technology giant has admitted this bias, and not only in its LLM but also in other leading LLMs. In its Llama 4 release announcement, Meta says that it is specifically addressing ""left-leaning"" political bias in its AI model, distinguishing this effort from traditional bias concerns around race, gender, and nationality that researchers have long documented. In a blog post the company said, ""Our goal is to remove bias from our AI models and to make sure that Llama can understand and articulate both sides of a contentious issue. As part of this work, we’re continuing to make Llama more responsive so that it answers questions, can respond to a variety of different viewpoints without passing judgment, and doesn't favor some views over others.""Not just this, it claims that 'Biasness' or should we say 'Left Leanings' is not only problem of Meta LLM, but one that afflicts all leading LLMs. ""It’s well-known that all leading LLMs have had issues with bias—specifically, they historically have leaned left when it comes to debated political and social topics.This is due to the types of training data available on the internet,"" reads the blog post. Leading LLMs mean, among others, LLMs of Google and OpenAI. ""As part of this work, we’re continuing to make Llama more responsive so that it answers questions, can respond to a variety of different viewpoints without passing judgment, and doesn't favor some views over others,"" the post added.* Llama 4 refuses less on debated political and social topics overall (from 7% in Llama 3.3 to below 2%).* Llama 4 is dramatically more balanced with which prompts it refuses to respond to (the proportion of unequal response refusals is now less than 1% on a set of debated topical questions).* Our testing shows that Llama 4 responds with strong political lean at a rate comparable to Grok (and at half of the rate of Llama 3.3) on a contentious set of political or social topics. While we are making progress, we know we have more work to do and will continue to drive this rate further down.While biasness in LLMs is a known fact, what has surprised analysts is that Meta's post mentions only 'left leaning' bias and not 'right leaning' as many claim in Elon Musk's Grok.","Facebook-parent Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg just said what many people have claimed about LLMs (AI models) -- that they are biased.

‘It’s not me’: Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett issues ‘AI Deepfake’ advisory,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/its-not-me-berkshire-hathaway-ceo-warren-buffett-issues-ai-deepfake-advisory/articleshow/125183984.cms,"Read full message from Berkshire Hathaway

It has come to the attention of Warren Buffett that there are several videos posted on YouTube that include alleged comments of Mr. Buffett by images or AI created images impersonating Mr. Buffett. Generally, such video images of Mr. Buffett may appear to look like him but the sound of the impersonator speaking in a very flat monotone voice is clearly not the voice of Mr. Buffett. A link to one such video appearing on YouTube follows: https://www.youtube.com/@WW2Echoessss. Mr. Buffett is concerned that these types of fraudulent videos are becoming a spreading virus. Individuals who are less familiar with Mr. Buffett may believe these videos are real and be misled by the contents of these videos.

Mr. Buffett has rarely commented publicly since Berkshire’s shareholder’s meeting last May. On Monday, November 10th, Berkshire will be issuing a press release which will contain a message from Mr. Buffett regarding philanthropy, Berkshire and other matters that Berkshire shareholders and others may find to be of interest.





Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett has issued a public warning after it is reported that several videos utilising AI-generated images and voices of the CEO are circulating on YouTube, offering investment advice he never gave. The message from the company is clear: there is only one “Oracle of Omaha,” and viewers should be wary of increasingly convincing deepfakes.Berkshire Hathaway issued a press release titled ""It’s Not Me"", specifically highlighting a video titled ""Warren Buffett: The #1 Investment Tip For Everyone Over 50 (MUST WATCH),"" where an impersonated voice offers financial advice.The company stated that while the visuals often mimic the 95-year-old investor, the audio typically features flat, generic speech that “clearly” is not his voice.According to a report by news agency Reuters, Buffett has been an increasing target for AI impersonators, a phenomenon he has complained about previously. In October 2024, weeks before the US presidential election, he warned of ""fraudulent claims"" that he had endorsed political candidates and investment products. The investor has largely stepped back from formal political endorsements in recent years.","Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett has issued a public warning after it is reported that several videos utilising AI-generated images and voices of the CEO are circulating on YouTube.

The WhatsApp Scam That Gives Hackers Your Phone!

Beta testing and availability



Apple Watch gets a dedicated WhatsApp app







WhatsApp is reportedly rolling out a new layer of security for users who may be vulnerable to targeted hacking attempts. As reported by WABetaInfo, the feature, called “Strict Account Settings,” was spotted in the latest iOS beta version (25.33.10.70) and is designed to offer “extreme protections” for accounts deemed high-risk. Found under Privacy > Advanced, the new setting allows users to activate a suite of automatic safeguards. According to WhatsApp, this mode is intended for individuals who believe they are at risk of cyberattacks—such as journalists, activists, or public figures—and may reduce the overall messaging experience in favour of tighter security.Once enabled, “Strict Account Settings” applies the following protections:* Blocks media and attachments from unknown senders* Silences calls from unfamiliar numbers* Restricts group invites to known contacts only* Disables link previews* Enforces two-step verification* Notifies users of encryption key changes* Locks certain privacy settings to prevent tamperingThese measures are designed to minimise exposure to phishing, impersonation, and other forms of digital intrusion.The feature is currently being tested through TestFlight on iOS, and is expected to roll out more broadly in the coming weeks. WhatsApp has not confirmed a release date for Android users, but similar protections are likely to follow. While most users won’t need this level of security, WhatsApp emphasises that it’s a proactive step to support those in sensitive roles or under digital threat. Users can toggle the feature on or off at any time, giving them control over their security posture.Recently, WhatsApp introduced its first standalone Apple Watch app. This new app will make it significantly easier for Apple Watch users to manage and interact with their chats on the popular Meta-owned messaging service directly from the smartwatch without needing their iPhone. The new software includes several enhanced features, such as the ability to record and send voice messages, receive full call notifications, view full-length message previews, and utilise message reactions. These updates bring WhatsApp functionality closer to parity with Apple's native messaging app on the watch.","WhatsApp is reportedly rolling out a new layer of security for users who may be vulnerable to targeted hacking attempts.

IBM CEO does not agree with JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon on this basic office meeting etiquette,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ibm-ceo-does-not-agree-with-jpmorgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-on-this-basic-office-meeting-etiquette/articleshow/125181270.cms,"Dimon’s smartphone rule in office







IBM CEO Arvind Krishna and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon hold different views on phone use during workplace meetings. Dimon takes a stricter stance against phones and tablets while Krishna argues that the context matters. Dimon told Fortune at the Most Powerful Women summit last month that he expects full attention during meetings. On the contrary, Krishna says smaller meetings require different behaviour.For Dimon, working on the phone or tablet during meetings is disrespectful.“If you have an iPad in front of me and it looks like you're reading your email or getting notifications, I tell you to close the damn thing. It's disrespectful,"" Dimon said.Krishna told CNN last week that his approach depends on meeting size. He said it would be unusual for a technology company to prohibit employees from using their devices, particularly in larger gatherings.“I distinguish between one-to-10-person meetings and very large meetings. If it's a very large meeting, I'm sorry. It's not really a meeting. It's a communication vehicle. You're just informing people,” Krishna said.“If it's a small meeting, I would really frown upon if somebody is sitting opposite my desk and lost in their phone, I would tell them, 'why don't you come back when you have time?’” he said.Meeting behaviour has been a recurring concern for Dimon. In his annual letter to shareholders, he mentioned “meetings” six times, urging employees to schedule them only when necessary and to make them productive.“I see people in meetings all the time who are getting notifications and personal texts or who are reading emails. This has to stop. It's disrespectful. It wastes time,"" Dimon wrote.Dimon's frustration extends beyond small meetings. During a conversation at Stanford University in March, he described joining a Zoom meeting where attention was divided.“There were 12 people in the room and four people on the screen and all four people on the screen were on their phone,"" Dimon said, adding, “And people say, and you think you're focusing and learning?”The JPMorgan CEO has also said that he doesn’t carry his mobile phone during office hours and only reads texts from his immediate family. He noted that if someone wants to reach him and it’s important, they should call his office.",IBM CEO Arvind Krishna and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon hold different views on phone use during workplace meetings.
