Bluebird Lift-Off Shows ISRO Commercial Power As Nambi Narayanan Calls LVM-3 Game Changer Move

The Indian Space Research Organisation ( Isro ) on Wednesday released rare onboard camera footage from its heaviest rocket, LVM3-M6, offering a rocket-eye view of the BlueBird Block-2 mission from liftoff to satellite separation.The footage shared by Isro on X features visuals captured by cameras onboard and documents each major phase of the ascent. The footage shows the rocket lifting off from the second launch pad at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh, followed by the separation of the twin S200 solid strap-on boosters. It then captures the separation of the L110 liquid core stage and the jettisoning of the payload fairing, before concluding with the successful separation of the BlueBird Block-2 satellite into Low Earth Orbit.The stunning visuals were recorded during Isro’s successful commercial launch of the next-generation US communication satellite for AST SpaceMobile earlier in the day. The 6,100 kg satellite was placed into its intended orbit at an altitude of about 520 km, approximately 15 minutes after launch.The 43.5-metre-tall LVM3 lifted off at 8.55 am after the completion of a 24-hour countdown. Powered by two S200 solid boosters, a liquid core stage and a cryogenic upper stage, the rocket performed all mission events as planned.The space agency said the mission, designated LVM3-M6, marked the sixth operational flight of the LVM3 launch vehicle, nicknamed ‘Bahubali’ for its heavy-lift capability. Isro chief, Dr V Narayanan, described mission’s success as a ""season’s gift"" to the country.BlueBird Block-2 is part of a Low Earth Orbit constellation being developed by US-based AST SpaceMobile. The satellite is designed to enable direct-to-mobile connectivity, providing 4G and 5G voice and video calls, text messaging, streaming and data services directly to standard mobile smartphones.Developed by Isro, the three-stage LVM3 has a lift-off mass of 640 tonnes and a payload capability of 4,200 kg to Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit. In earlier missions, it has successfully launched Chandrayaan-2, Chandrayaan-3 and two OneWeb missions carrying 72 satellites.","Isro released rare onboard camera footage from its heaviest rocket, LVM3-M6, offering a rocket-eye view of the BlueBird Block-2 mission.

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu was recently asked by an X (formerly Twitter) user why there is no talk about Arattai now?

Alexandr Wang is reportedly clashing with Meta’s old guard

Meta’s Secret AI Army: Top Talent Hired from OpenAI, Google & More

Alexandr Wang memo on Meta's massive AI restructure





In June this year, Facebook-parent Meta Platforms agreed to take a 49% stake in artificial intelligence (AI) startup Scale AI for $14.8 billion. As part of the deal, Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang took top position inside Meta, leading the company's new “superintelligence” lab, , Meta Superintelligence Labs, or MSL. The 28-year-old founder of Scale AI, Wang has been installed as the public face of Zuckerberg’s AI reboot. Mark Zuckerberg reportedly paid billions to bring billionaire AI prodigy Alexandr Wang on board. However, it reportedly seems that all is not well between the AI wunderkind and his Boss, Mark Zuckerberg. The 41-year-old Zuckerberg is said to have backed his new hires with nine-figure compensation packages to lure top researchers from rivals, igniting a Silicon Valley poaching war.According to a report in Financial Times, Wang privately believes that CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s micromanagement of the company’s AI push is ""suffocating"". Wang is said to have complained to associates that Zuckerberg’s tight grip on the effort is stifling progress, the report said, citing multiple people familiar with the situation. Report adds that cracks have begun to emerge at an executive level and that tensions have been bubbling between Wang and Zuckerberg for sometime now.As per the report, internally, some staff question whether Wang is out of his depth, given his lack of experience managing teams in a large corporation but also his expertise in AI data services rather than as an AI researcher pushing technical breakthroughs.Incidentally, Alexander Wang’s arrival at Meta has created friction over the company's fundamental approach to AI development, with his superintelligence team pushing to make the company’s next model “closed” — keeping its technology secret. This is said to mark a major departure from Meta’s longtime philosophy of open-sourcing its models for other developers to build upon, causing some old guard members to chafe at the change, the Times reported.The new leadership has chosen to abandon Meta’s previous frontier model called Behemoth, which saw its release delayed last spring after disappointing performance tests. Meta’s AI division faces a dramatic four-way split as Meta reorganizes into groups focused on research, superintelligence development, products, and infrastructure, according to the report.As the new vision and leadership have crystallised, some top names have left. Among them, in recent weeks, Meta’s longtime chief legal officer Jennifer Newstead was poached by arch-rival Apple, while chief revenue officer John Hegeman announced he too was leaving to launch a start-up.Similarly, chief AI scientist and Turing Award winner Yann LeCun is departing Meta to launch a new AI initiative. He had reportedly taken exception at having to report to Wang. Another reason cited for his resignation is that his longer-term research was reportedly hit hard by the recent cuts announced at Meta.Meta reorganized its AI teams in June this year. The memo said that most team leaders will report directly to 28-year-old Wang. This included investor and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, who heads MSL's product team and was announced as an MSL leader alongside Wang in June. In the email sent to employees, Wang wrote that ""superintelligence is coming,"" and to ""take it seriously,"" Meta needs to make major changes. This includes establishing four distinct teams that focus on research, training, products, and infrastructure.The reorganisation is the latest in a series of AI reorgs for Meta. Incidentally, Meta had already dissolved two major AI teams in the past six months.","Mark Zuckerberg reportedly paid billions to bring billionaire AI prodigy Alexandr Wang on board.

Apple's Secret 3-Year Plan: A New iPhone Era is Coming!

iPhone Fold expected design and features



iPhone Fold expected price







Apple is expected to launch its first foldable smartphone next year. Now, the long-rumoured foldable iPhone from Apple has appeared in newly leaked renders offering a clear look at the design of first foldable iPhone. As per the YouTube channel Front Page Tech and popular tipper Ice Universe, the design of Apple’s first foldable iPhone may resemble to Google’s Pixel Fold. As per the images leaked online, the yet-to-launch foldable iPhone is said to feature a book-style foldable design.As per the leaks, the upcoming foldable iPhone is said to feature a large internal display and a smaller cover screen. The renders also highlight a minimal crease along with fold area where rival devices like Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold have often drawn criticism. The design appears to prioritize durability and a seamless viewing experience, aligning with Apple’s reputation for premium hardware aesthetics.“The comparison of the design of the Samsung Galaxy Wide Fold and the Apple iPhone Fold is almost identical, with the only difference being the R-angle. Samsung is more square, while Apple is more rounded. Do you prefer the square one or the rounder one?,” wrote Ice Universe.Early leaks suggest that the first foldable iPhone may look and function differently from the current iPhone lineup. It is expected that the foldable iPhone may ditch the Face ID in order to accommodate the thinner foldable design. It is also said that the company may include a 24MP under-display selfie camera which will offer a cleaner and uninterrupted look to the display. The is also tipped that the foldable iPhone may feature another 24MP camera on the cover display making it easier for the users to take selfies or answer video calls.On the back, the foldable iPhone may feature a dual-lens setup with two 48MP sensors — one standard and one ultrawide — but no telephoto lens. This simplified camera system seems to be a design trade-off to maintain the slim build that a foldable phone requires. While the camera specs may sound modest compared to Apple’s Pro models, the focus for this device appears to be on delivering a sleek design, new display technology, and the flexibility of a foldable form factor.Multiple online rumours suggest that the upcoming Foldable iPhone may be priced around $2,399.","The long-rumoured foldable iPhone from Apple has appeared in newly leaked renders.

New York governor Kathy Hochul has sent a warning to social media platforms. She announced that social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and others are required to display prominent mental health warning labels on their feeds under a new law. The mandate specifically targets features designed to encourage excessive use, such as infinite scrolling, auto-play videos, among others.According to a report by news agency Reuters, the law applies to conduct occurring partly or wholly in New York but not when the platform is accessed by users physically outside the state. This move is the latest escalation in an effort to curb the ‘addictive’ nature of these social media websites, particularly for younger users.“Keeping New Yorkers safe has been my top priority since taking office, and that includes protecting our kids from the potential harms of social media features that encourage excessive use,” Hochul said in a statement.The governor framed the new requirement as a basic public safety measure, comparing the digital warnings to those found on physical products that pose health or safety risks. The legislation is tailored to the mechanics of modern social media:Content that continues to load as the user moves down the page.Videos that start automatically, often leading to longer-than-intended viewing sessions.Content curated by AI to maximise user engagement.New York is not alone in its pursuit of stricter digital safeguards, and joins California and Minnesota in passing social media regulations. Australia, earlier this month, banned social media entirely for children under the age of 16.The legislation aligns with a 2023 advisory from the US Surgeon General, who warned of the risks social media poses to youth mental health and specifically called for the type of warning labels New York has now codified into law.","New York governor compares social media with 'Tobacco' addiction.

Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

UAE official weather alert

Daytime: Fair to partly cloudy skies most days.

Nighttime: Cooler with occasional fog or mist in inland and coastal areas.

Overall winds will stay light to moderate, occasionally becoming more active.

Rain forecast across UAE

Primary Zones: The islands and Northern Emirates are at the highest risk for rainfall.

Intensity: While most areas will see light drizzles, some northern regions may experience heavy downpours at times.

Duration: The cloud cover will persist until Sunday, December 29, meaning outdoor plans should include a backup indoor option.

Safety warning

Winter hits hard





The UAE is trading its sunny blue skies for a more atmospheric winter vibe this week.According to the National Centre of Meteorology (NCM), a weak extension of a low-pressure system is sweeping across the country from December 25 to December 29.This shift means residents can look forward to generally pleasant and moderate daytime temperatures, while the nights will take on a noticeably crisper, cooler edge.The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) forecasts generally pleasant and moderate weather across the UAE from Thursday, Dec 25 through Monday, Dec 29. Temperatures will remain mild during the day and dip slightly at night, typical for the start of winter, as a weak low-pressure extension moves over the region.Expect scattered precipitation throughout the weekend. The NCM predicts that rainfall will be intermittent and vary in intensity, mostly appearing as light to moderate showers.Authorities are urging extra caution for commuters and mariners due to two major environmental hazards. High humidity levels will peak during the late night and early morning hours. This will likely result in thick mist and fog over inland and western areas.Drivers are advised to reduce speeds and closely follow police instructions on major highways.Sea conditions in the Arabian Gulf and the Sea of Oman will remain manageable until Saturday. However, by Sunday, fresh northwesterly winds will cause the sea to become rough. Mariners and beachgoers should avoid deep-sea activities as the wind speeds increase.The UAE is currently experiencing its coldest week of the season. A weather station at Jebel Jais in Ras Al Khaimah recorded a bone-chilling 3.5°C at midnight recently, the lowest temperature of the year.As the rain clouds move in, daytime temperatures across the country will remain moderate, but nighttime temperatures will continue to dip significantly, especially in the desert and mountainous regions. If you are planning a desert camping trip this Christmas weekend, ensure you have heavy winter gear, as the humidity and wind will make it feel even colder than the recorded mercury.",A weak extension of a low-pressure system is sweeping across the country.

So Ziegler and a growing group of her peers are forging ahead, cobbling together lesson plans from nonprofit groups and updating older coursework to address new technologies, such as AI that powers video apps like Sora.Their methods are hands-on, including classroom exercises that fact-check posts about history on TikTok and explore how badges that appear to signal verification on social media can often be bought rather than earned.Ziegler's efforts showcase the difficulties of keeping pace with new platforms, apps and advances in AI. ""We're sending these kids out into the world, and we're supposed to have provided them skills,"" said the former California teacher of the year. ""The tricky part is that we adults are learning this skill at the same time the kids are.""Social media literacy is a tough subject for schools to try to teach, especially now. Federal funding for education is precarious, and the Trump administration has politicised and penalised the study of disinformation and misinformation.The News Literacy Project, a media education nonprofit, surveyed 1,110 teenagers in May last year and found that 4 in 10 said they had any media literacy instruction in class that year. Eight in 10 said they had come across a conspiracy theory on social media, and many said they were inclined to believe at least one of the narratives.Ziegler teaches the self-described ""screenagers"" that their social media feeds are populated using highly responsive algorithms, and that large followings do not make accounts trustworthy. In one case, students learned to distinguish between a reputable historians group on Instagram and a historical satire account with a similar name. Now, they default to double-checking information that interests them online. ""That's the starting point,"" said Xavier Malizia, 17. Elisha Tuerk-Levy, 18, said it was ""jarring"" to watch a realistic AI video of someone falling off Mt Everest, but added that the visuals in such videos were often too smooth - a useful ""tell"" that helps identify them as fake.Policymakers are paying more attention to the issue. Dr Vivek Murthy, the surgeon general under former President Joe Biden, urged schools in 2023 to set up digital literacy instruction. At least 25 states have approved related legislation, according to an upcoming report from Media Literacy Now, a nonprofit group. Many of the new rules, however, are voluntary, toothless or slow to take effect or do not acknowledge the growing presence of AI.""I absolutely wish we could make things happen faster,"" said California Assembly member Marc Berman, a Democrat who wrote two media literacy bills passed in 2023 and 2024.""It's about really strengthening those foundational skills so that no matter what tech pops up between now and then, young people have the ability to handle it,"" Berman said.","Valerie Ziegler is part of a vanguard of California educators racing to prepare students in a rapidly changing online world.

Dubai new e-scooter safety rules: What riders must know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/dubai-new-e-scooter-safety-rules-what-riders-must-know/articleshow/126184645.cms,"Dubai tightens e-scooter safety rules across public roads / Image: File

RTA ’s key e-scooter safety rules

Riders must follow posted speed limits and stay in designated scooter or shared lanes.

Wearing helmets and bright or reflective clothing is strongly advised to stay visible.

Scooters should maintain a safe distance from pedestrians, bicycles, and other riders.

Clear new guidelines

E-scooters must be clean, dry, and folded before boarding public transport vehicles.

They can only be stored in designated areas and must be securely immobilized during travel.

A maximum of two scooters per journey is allowed to avoid crowding and obstruction.

Certain modes, like intercity buses, prohibit e-scooters altogether.



Penalties





Dubai is moving faster toward a greener future, and e-scooters have become the star of the show. Whether you’re zipping through Dubai Marina or using a scooter to bridge the gap between your home and the office, these nimble vehicles are everywhere. However, as their popularity has surged, so has the need for clear, common-sense rules.The aim of the new rules is simple: protect riders, pedestrians, and commuters while keeping Dubai’s transport network running smoothly. Officials say the changes reflect the city’s commitment to safe, orderly mobility, whether you’re riding a scooter, hopping on a metro, or walking down a busy street.The RTA has been actively reminding residents and visitors about essential safety guidelines as e-scooter use grows. These rules help reduce accidents and ensure everyone shares the roads and paths responsibly:The RTA has stressed that safe riding is a shared responsibility between riders and all road users. Taking personal precautions, obeying traffic rules, and being aware of surroundings help prevent incidents as e-scooter trips become part of daily life.One of the most practical changes affects how scooters interact with Dubai’s mass transit system. The RTA has outlined eight safety requirements for carrying e-scooters on public transport such as buses, designed to protect passengers and streamline boarding:These rules reinforce that while scooters are a flexible transport mode, they must be carried responsibly when combined with buses or other services to ensure safety for everyone on board.Dubai isn’t just reminding riders of rules; authorities are backing them with clear penalties to reinforce compliance. According to official summaries of RTA and Dubai Police enforcement, Riding without a permit or outside designated zones can lead to fines of about Dhs200–Dhs300.Not wearing a helmet, riding on jog or pedestrian paths, or ignoring speed limits carries fines. Riding dangerously, like against traffic, or parking scooters in unsafe spots can be penalized as well.These fines are part of a broader effort to keep micro-mobility safe without limiting access. Authorities note that proper permits, gear, and adherence to rules help riders enjoy scooters while minimising risks to others.E-scooters have become a visible symbol of micro-mobility in Dubai, popular for short journeys, last-mile connectivity, and easy travel between public transport stops. Yet, as their numbers rise, so do safety conversations.Recent community actions, such as e-scooter bans in some park areas and restrictions in crowded urban plazas, reflect the city’s careful balancing act between freedom of movement and public safety.As the RTA continues refining regulations and promoting awareness campaigns, officials emphasise that courtesy, caution, and compliance will make Dubai’s shared roads safer for riders, pedestrians, and commuters alike.","The aim of the new rules is simple: protect riders, pedestrians, and commuters while keeping Dubai’s transport network running smoothly.

Kuwait: Energy drinks banned at offices and schools — what the new rules mean,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/kuwait-energy-drinks-banned-at-offices-and-schools-what-the-new-rules-mean/articleshow/126170694.cms,"Kuwait bans energy drinks at offices and schools / AI Generated Image

Kuwait’s new energy drink rules

Age Restriction: You must be 18 or older to purchase an energy drink.

Daily Limit: Sales are capped at a maximum of two cans per person per day.

Caffeine Ceiling: Each can (250ml) is now legally restricted to a maximum of 80mg of caffeine, a move to prevent ""ultra-potent"" versions from hitting the market.

Warning Labels: Producers and importers must now feature clear, prominent health warnings on every single can.

Where you can and cannot buy?

All public and private schools, universities, and institutes.

All government offices and agencies.

Restaurants, cafes, grocery stores, food trucks, and even sports clubs.

Delivery platforms and online ordering apps are now barred from bringing these drinks to your doorstep.



Final take





As the world gears up for New Year celebrations, Kuwait is making a resolute resolution of its own: prioritizing the heart health of its citizens. In a sweeping move that has sent ripples through the local food and beverage industry, Minister of Health Dr. Ahmad Al-Awadhi has issued a ministerial decree that fundamentally changes how energy drinks are sold, advertised, and consumed across the nation.This isn’t just a minor adjustment; it is a comprehensive regulatory overhaul designed to curb the health risks, like heart palpitations and sleep disorders, that have been increasingly linked to high-caffeine lifestyles among the youth.Kuwait’s Minister of Health, Dr. Ahmad Al-Awadhi, signed a ministerial decree with key rules on energy drinks:These rules are designed to discourage excessive consumption, particularly among adolescents and young adults who are seen as more vulnerable to the stimulant effects of caffeine-heavy drinks.The most striking part of the decree is the list of ""No-Go Zones."" Effective immediately, the sale and distribution of energy drinks are strictly prohibited in:By removing these drinks from everyday social spots, the government aims to decouple the ""fun"" of dining out or hanging with friends from the consumption of high-stimulant beverages.If you’re looking to stock up, your options are now limited to Cooperative Societies (Co-ops) and parallel markets.However, don't expect to find them next to the bread and milk. The decree mandates that these outlets must create ""designated areas"" for energy drinks, where sales will be under strict supervision to ensure age and quantity limits are followed to the letter.Kuwait’s energy drink rules are not a ban on the drinks themselves, but they are among the most comprehensive controls seen in the Gulf. By restricting sales to adults, limiting consumption, banning ads, and removing availability in common public places, the government is clearly prioritizing health, particularly that of younger residents.For consumers and businesses alike, this means adapting to new buying habits and greater awareness around what and how much they drink. Whether you’re a regular energy drink fan or a health-conscious reader curious about world policies, Kuwait’s decision offers a clear example of how governments can use regulation to shape everyday lifestyles for public benefit.","Kuwait’s Minister of Health, Dr. Ahmad Al-Awadhi, signed a ministerial decree with key rules on energy drinks.

Democracy

: The Failure Of Politics And The Parting Of Friends

Anne Applebaum





More often than not, we tend to associate autocratic regimes with a cult of personalities. Think Hitler, Stalin, Idi Amin. However, no autocrat rules alone. They are all supported by an elite that actually props up the regimes.byexplores how this class of elite is created, what motivates them to support autocrats, and why perfectly intelligent people junk their liberal instincts.Law and Justice Party in Poland and Viktor Orban’s Fidesz in Hungary both successfully bludgeoned the established elite to rise to power. In Poland’s case, the device of choice was the Smolensk conspiracy, around the 2010 plane crash killing then president Lech Kaczynski. The conspiracy not only served as a vehicle to polarise Polish society, but also gave Law and Justice Party the ammunition to demonise the opposition, and accuse them variously of being communists, working with Russia or simply being anti-Poland.In the process, Law and Justice was able to increase its hold on political power, neutralise the media, and take over businesses through those close to the party. Similarly, over in Hungary, Orban used the bogey of immigration (Hungary practically has no immigrants), the manufactured lie of George Soros undermining Hungary and Christian values, and the tyranny of EU bureaucrats in Brussels, to advance his hold over power, says Applebaum.But why did people go along with these deceptions? Moreover, why did people of significant intellect – also close friends of the author – switch out their liberal, European values, and join the ideology and tactics they had earlier fought against during the Cold War?There are multiple explanations. First, some of these intellectuals felt liberalisation did not benefit them as much as their peers. This was a heavy chip on their shoulders. So, when the opportunity arose to shaft their elite peers, they gleefully took it without any concern for rule of law and democratic values.Others were simply cynical, like Boris Johnson. Starting off as a British correspondent in Brussels, he would hand in sensationalist reports about EU with little grain of truth. He was even blasé about it. But those reports played a part in influencing Euro-sceptic Conservative members of British Parliament and driving the Brexit movement later.Why would Johnson do such a thing? Per Applebaum, perhaps because of his own background, which was very much rooted in the British elite and aristocratic clubs such as the Bullingdon at Oxford. Johnson clearly felt the pomp and show was ridiculous. Therefore, he didn’t mind chucking stones at his own elite peers.Then, there is nostalgia. Reformative nostalgia seeks to physically recreate an imagined great past – like resurrecting the prowess of the old British Empire. But who do you blame for the decline? Outsiders, of course – immigrants, EU and the liberal elite.Finally, Applebaum theorises that great changes of the 21st century won’t come like they did in the past, precisely because media has been democratised. There are many who instinctively struggle with diversity and want simplicity. Established traditional media ensured debates were confined to a narrow comfortable spectrum. New media breaks that mould with a cacophony of opinions. This in turn has the opposite effect of pushing people into their comfortable information silos, making them more susceptible to manipulation, and empowering autocrats.","Law and Justice Party in Poland and Viktor Orban’s Fidesz in Hungary both successfully bludgeoned the established elite to rise to power.

Is SmartPocket trustworthy?





For many students in the UAE, the gap between a monthly allowance and the cost of living can feel like a mountain to climb. Recognizing this, two young visionaries, Najib Mikati, a senior at the American School of Dubai, and Naji Faqihinejad, a freshman at George Washington University, spent 18 months developing SmartPocket.This mobile platform is more than just a discount tool; it is a financial companion designed specifically for the 12-to-25 demographic, helping them stretch their dirhams while learning the ""why"" behind their spending.Nineteen-year-old Emirati student Naji Faqihi Al Awadhi came up with the idea for SmartPocket while he was in his final year at the American School of Dubai. Like many students, his monthly allowance stayed the same, but costs for essentials such as food, fashion and fitness kept climbing due to inflation.“While our monthly allowances from our parents stayed the same, our spending needs naturally evolved,” Al Awadhi told Khaleej Times, explaining the spark behind the idea. What began as a personal challenge became the seed of a platform designed to make student life more affordable.Two years later, SmartPocket launched publicly in October 2025, giving students a dedicated place to access discounts from more than 20 brands across multiple categories.SmartPocket isn’t open to everyone, users must first verify their student status before accessing deals. Verification happens through official channels like university email addresses or documents such as Emirates IDs, ensuring that only real students can benefit from the discounts.Once verified, students can browse and redeem offers from partner brands in categories such as:Al Awadhi estimates that, on average, users end up reducing their monthly spending by around 20%, though the platform is still new and collecting data to confirm long-term saving trends.This concept is similar in spirit to global student discount networks, like UNiDAYS, which offers exclusive student deals on hundreds of brands worldwide, but SmartPocket is tailored specifically to the UAE market with its own verification and brand partnerships.At the heart of SmartPocket is 19-year-old Emirati student Naji Faqihi Al Awadhi, while studying at the American School of Dubai, Al Awadhi noticed a familiar problem: his monthly allowance didn’t stretch as far as he wanted, especially as prices for food, fashion and leisure kept rising. Rather than simply accept it, he began thinking about a way to help students keep more of their money without cutting out the things they enjoy.The idea for SmartPocket grew from that simple challenge. After two years of refining the concept and building the platform, SmartPocket officially launched in October 2025, offering students a verified way to access deals and discounts from a growing list of local brands.Al Awadhi’s entrepreneurial journey began even earlier. At just 15 years old, he started helping his brother resell sneakers and streetwear, an early lesson in understanding markets and customer demand. That experience gave him a foundation in business that he applied to SmartPocket’s developmentOne common question about new discount platforms is whether they are legitimate and safe to use. With SmartPocket, there are a few signs that help answer this clearly.First, SmartPocket requires real student verification before anyone can access discounts. Students must verify their status using university email addresses or official documents like Emirates ID, which helps ensure the platform isn’t being misused by non-students. This verification step is a basic trust and security measure, similar to how other student discount services operate globally.Second, the app is listed on major app distribution sites like the Apple App Store, where it is presented as a genuine UAE-focused student discount app with clear offer details and secure sign-in features. This listing shows that the platform is intended for legitimate use and meets basic app store standards for security and functionality.","Naji Faqihi Al Awadhi, 19, came up with the idea for SmartPocket in his final year at the American School of Dubai.

The desert heat has officially taken a backseat to the twinkling lights and ""snowy"" lanes of the UAE’s festive season. If you are looking to soak up the holiday spirit, 2025 has brought some of the most elaborate Christmas markets the region has ever seen. From giant trees to AI-powered elves, the magic is spread across Dubai and Abu Dhabi.Whether you are a resident or just visiting for the holidays, these five spots are the absolute ""must-sees"" for a cup of mulled grape and a photo with the big man in red.If you only visit one market this year, let it be this one. Nestled among the waterways of Souk Madinat Jumeirah, this 1,750-square-meter wonderland is the gold standard for festive vibes. The centerpiece is a massive 36-foot Christmas tree, and the view of the Burj Al Arab behind it is simply unbeatable.Expo City has transformed Al Wasl Plaza into a futuristic North Pole toy factory. This year’s theme, ""The Candy Cane Comet,"" features a guiding light that only shines with the help of visiting children. It is immersive, grand, and arguably the most high-tech Christmas experience in the country.Located on Sheikh Zayed Road, the Winter Garden at Habtoor Palace is where the ""cool"" crowd gathers. It’s less about the rides and more about the atmosphere, think cozy food trucks, live musicians, and a pet-friendly policy that means your furry friends don't have to miss out on the fun.For those who want their Christmas with a side of international culture, Global Village is celebrating its landmark 30th season in style. Their festive village is packed with 3,500 shopping outlets across 30 pavilions, making it the ultimate destination for unique holiday gifts.Abu Dhabi’s capital isn't trailing behind. The Galleria has turned its North Atrium into a Winter Wonderland that blends tradition with technology. It’s perfect for families who want a polished, indoor festive experience without the sand.Whether you are hunting for the perfect handmade gift, craving a cup of spice-infused hot chocolate, or simply want to feel a bit of “snow” on your face in the middle of the desert, the UAE’s 2025 festive season has something for everyone. From the high-tech lights of Expo City to the traditional charm of Madinat Jumeirah, these markets are about more than just shopping, they are about making memories in a city that truly knows how to celebrate.Live music, street performances and festive food stalls add to the atmosphere, turning each visit into a full evening experience rather than a quick stop. Many venues also offer family-friendly activities, making them ideal for visitors of all ages.Top Tip for 2025: Most of these venues get extremely busy on weekend evenings. If you can, try visiting on a weekday right when they open (around 4:00 PM) to catch the sunset views and beat the largest crowds. Don't forget to keep your camera charged, you’re going to need it.","The UAE has some of the most elaborate Christmas markets the region has ever seen.

Transport alerts in the UAE





When the skies open up and heavy rains sweep across the UAE, the aftermath often leaves motorists facing soggy carpets, stalled engines, or worse. Historically, getting an official police report for these ""natural disasters"" meant towing your vehicle to a police station and waiting for a manual inspection. That has officially changed. Dubai Police have launched a fully automated digital service specifically for vehicle damage caused by weather conditions.Dubai Police have introduced a new online service that allows motorists to obtain a ‘To Whom It May Concern’ certificate for vehicle damage caused by weather conditions, without needing to visit a police station in person. This certificate is often required when motorists file insurance claims for damage inflicted during heavy rain, floods or other natural events.Previously, drivers had to apply online and then take their vehicle to a police station for inspection before receiving the certificate. With this update, vehicle owners can skip the station visit entirely. They simply visit the Dubai Police website, upload photos of the damaged vehicle, apply for the natural disasters certificate, and receive the document electronically within one to two business days for a fee of AED 95.Brigadier Mansour Al Qargaoui, Director of the General Department for Administrative Affairs at Dubai Police, explained that the automated process reflects the authority’s commitment to smarter, faster public services in response to increasing extreme weather events in the UAE.The UAE has recently experienced heavy rainfall, strong winds, thunderstorms and occasional hail, affecting roads and vehicles across several emirates. Dubai Police and other authorities have been issuing weather safety advisories, urging motorists to stay alert, reduce speed, and avoid flood-prone areas as visibility decreases during adverse weather.As part of this context, many drivers have reported rain-related damage to their vehicles, from water leakage and engine issues to electronics malfunctions. With weather impacting travel and property, the automated certificate service comes at a much-needed time to help motorists secure proper documentation for insurance processes without the traditional hassle.The process has been designed to be quick and straightforward for users:Dubai Police also provide support via their hotline at 901 for those who have questions about the service or need assistance during the application process.This digital process reduces time, eliminates the need for police station visits, and allows motorists to move forward with their insurance claims efficiently and safely after extreme weather impacts.Alongside this certification service, Dubai Police have been active in issuing weather safety reminders and advisories as unstable weather continues across the region. Motorists are urged to exercise caution when driving, avoid non-essential travel during storms, and follow instructions from emergency services to ensure personal safety and reduce accident risks on slippery roads.Authorities have also cautioned against visiting beaches or flood-prone valleys during weather disturbances and regularly update residents about expected conditions via alerts to mobile phones and official social media channels.","Dubai Police have introduced a new online service that allows motorists to obtain a ‘To Whom It May Concern’ certificate for vehicle damage caused by weather conditions.

The joint US-Canada military organisation that 'tracks' Santa during Christmas,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/the-joint-us-canada-military-organisation-that-tracks-santa-during-christmas/articleshow/126173020.cms,"A screen shows the progress of Santa Claus as volunteers answer calls from people wondering where he is on his journey around the globe at a call center Wednesday, Dec. 24, 2025, in NORAD Peterson Space Force Base in Colorado Springs, Colo.

What is NORAD?

Trump Survives Aerial Attack? U.S. & Canada Deploy Fighters After Plane Breaches Mar-A-Lago Airspace

How does NORAD track Santa?

How can you follow Santa’s journey?





On Christmas Eve, while the world obsesses over last-minute gifts and delayed flights, one of the planet’s most serious military commands performs its most unserious duty. Deep inside command centres built to detect nuclear threats and hostile aircraft, NORAD turns its radars north and begins tracking a sleigh pulled by reindeer. It sounds like a punchline. It is not. For nearly seven decades, the North American Aerospace Defense Command has treated Santa Claus as a seasonal constant, monitored with the same institutional solemnity it reserves for far graver things.There is something quietly comforting about that. In a world saturated with cynicism, this is the rare tradition that does not apologise for believing.NORAD is a joint US–Canada military organisation tasked with defending North American airspace and monitoring maritime approaches. Its job is to provide early warning of aerospace threats, track aircraft and missiles, and coordinate responses if something suspicious enters the skies.It was created during the Cold War, an era when radar blips carried existential weight. Every screen, every alert, every false positive mattered. That legacy remains. NORAD’s systems today include ground-based radars, satellites capable of detecting heat signatures, fighter jets on alert, and command centres that never sleep.Which is precisely why its Christmas Eve ritual works. If an institution this serious can pause to track Santa, the story carries an odd authority. This is not marketing fluff. This is lore backed by radar rooms.The tradition dates back to 1955, when a department store advertisement mistakenly printed a military hotline as Santa’s phone number. Instead of redirecting callers, the officer who answered played along, telling children that Santa’s sleigh had been detected on radar. The response was so popular that NORAD adopted the idea permanently.Over the years, the explanation has evolved alongside technology. NORAD says its northern warning radars first detect Santa as he lifts off from the North Pole. Once airborne, infrared satellites pick up the heat from Rudolph’s glowing red nose, a neat narrative overlap with systems designed to detect missile launches. As Santa approaches populated areas, NORAD fighter jets from the US and Canada occasionally escort the sleigh, confirming its position and, in official imagery, offering a friendly wave.It is all delivered deadpan. No quotation marks around “tracking.” No excessive irony. The charm lies in the confidence.Every December 24, NORAD opens its Santa-tracking operation to the public. The centrepiece is the NORAD Santa Tracker website, which displays a live map of Santa’s route across countries and cities as the night progresses. Each stop comes with trivia, animations, and updates on how many presents have been delivered so far.There is also a mobile app and regular social media updates, but the most old-school element remains the call centre. Thousands of volunteers, many of them military personnel, answer phones from around the world, patiently explaining Santa’s speed, altitude, and snack preferences to eager callers.The point is not realism. It is ritual. NORAD never oversells the tech or breaks the spell. It simply offers a straight-faced narrative and lets the audience decide how much to believe.In an age where surveillance usually signals anxiety and control, NORAD’s Santa tracker flips the script. For one night, radars are not watching for threats but for generosity. Missiles are replaced by milk and cookies. And somewhere between the Arctic and your rooftop, a military command reminds the world that even the most hardened systems can make room for wonder.","NORAD is a joint US–Canada military organisation tasked with defending North American airspace and monitoring maritime approaches.

Ask Dhirendra: 'How do I decide how much to save and invest when my income is just about enough?',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/mutual-funds/ask-dhirendra-how-do-i-decide-how-much-to-save-and-invest-when-my-income-is-just-about-enough/articleshow/126072787.cms,"The problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save. (AI image)

“How do I decide how much to save and invest when my income is just about enough?”

What can you save today without breaking your life? How can you make that number grow every year?

Where does a typical salary go?

Some expenses are non-negotiable (rent, basic food, fees).

Some are negotiable but important (a modest phone, occasional eating out).

Some are pure leakage (unused subscriptions, impulsive orders, “I don’t even remember what this was”).

From spare change to serious money

Step up your SIP before you step up your lifestyle

First, add up your genuine essentials: rent/EMI, groceries, utilities, fees, basic transport.

Next, be realistic and add a modest amount for discretionary spending that you know you’ll do anyway – because you are human, not a robot.

See what is left. From that leftover, commit to a percentage – even 10% of your take-home income – as a non-negotiable saving and investing amount. Set up automatic transfers and SIPs for that right after your salary date.

(Dhirendra Kumar is Founder and CEO of Value Research)

This is one of those questions that sounds technical, but is actually very emotional.On paper, it’s simple: income comes in, expenses go out, and whatever is left is “savings. In real life, income comes in, rent, EMIs, school fees, petrol, Swiggy, Zomato, sale on Myntra, birthday gifts, one sudden expense… and at the end of the month, you look at your balance and say, “I’ll start investing from next month. Pakka.”Next month looks surprisingly similar.So let’s start with an honest admission: for most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.At Value Research, whenever we look at this, we don’t begin with a number like “you must save 30%”. We start with a different idea: savings are not what is left after spending. Savings are what you decide first; spending adjusts after that if you flip this order, the maths – and your behaviour – changes completely.A good rule of thumb for many middle-class households is to allocate 20–30% of their take-home income to savings and investments. However, I also know that for many people today, 30% sounds like a bad joke. So instead of fighting over the “ideal” number, let’s work with two simpler questions:To answer the first question, you need to know where your money is actually going, not where you think it is going.For one or two months, track your expenses honestly – not for Instagram, for yourself. You don’t need an app; even a simple notebook or spreadsheet works.Once you see your own pie chart, three things usually stand out:Your first “investment” might simply be plugging two or three leaks. Even if that frees up only ₹2,000–₹3,000 a month, that is your starting SIP.Now let’s look at how “small” that really is.When we run these numbers at Value Research in our retirement and goal calculators, the results are always the same: the gap between zero and small is far bigger than the gap between small and perfect.But what if your income truly is at the survival stage? There are people for whom even ₹2,000 is a luxury some months. If that’s your reality, you have two parallel jobs. One is to create a tiny habit – even ₹500 or ₹1,000 a month into a recurring deposit or a conservative fund. The absolute amount is less important than the mental switch from “I’ll save if anything is left” to “I will save something, and then I will live on the rest. ”The second job is to make sure that as your income grows, your lifestyle doesn’t expand at the same speed. This is where a lot of middle-class Indians quietly sabotage themselves. Every salary increase automatically becomes a better phone, nicer meals out, upgraded gadgets, and bigger car loans. The percentage saved stays the same, or sometimes even falls.A very powerful habit – one we often build into plans at Value Research – is the “step-up”. Each year, when your salary goes up, you increase your SIPs and savings before you upgrade anything else.In many examples we’ve run, the step-up strategy leads to a dramatically higher corpus at the end, without you ever feeling an acute “sacrifice” in any single year. You just avoid letting every pay hike leak out into lifestyle.Now, how do you decide your own number?Here’s a simple approach:If that number feels tight, start a little lower and promise yourself one thing: every time your income goes up, your savings rate will go up faster than your spending.At Value Research, when we build long-term plans, we don’t assume people will suddenly start saving 40% from next month. We assume they will start somewhere realistic, and then we design step-ups. The rigour is in the process, not in some magical starting number.One last point. Many people postpone investing because they are embarrassed by how small their starting amount looks. Please don’t underestimate the psychological power of seeing a small, growing pile that you started and maintained. It changes how you think about yourself: from “I can’t save” to “I am someone who always saves something.” That identity is worth more than one extra dinner out.So how much should you save and invest when your income feels just about enough? The honest answer is: start with whatever you can without lying to yourself, protect that amount like you protect your rent, and then make sure it rises every time your income increases. The “right” number is not what a formula says; it’s the number you will actually stick to for the next 20 years.The perfect percentage can wait. The first rupee cannot.","Dhirendra Kumar: For most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Microsoft Edge Gets a Major AI Upgrade with New Copilot Mode





Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Suleyman was asked if he thinks Gemini 3 – the latest version of Google’s AI chatbot – is better than Microsoft’s Copilot. The Microsoft AI CEO replied, saying: “It can do things that Copilot can’t do”, adding “but Copilot also has features that it doesn’t have.” Mustafa Suleyman further said that Copilot is “amazing for vision. It can see everything that you are seeing and talk to you in real time. You can share your screen with Copilot on mobile or desktop, talk about it and get feedback.”“We’re really trying to imagine the day-to-day experience of having this really intelligent assistant at your side, that can help unblock you whenever you get stuck,” he added.To recall, Google launched its latest and most-advanced AI model — Gemini 3 last month. Announcing the new model, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that the model is “the best model in the world for multimodal understanding.” Google claims that Gemini 3 is the most-advanced model and it is better at coding. The new AI model is claimed to be more creative and versatile as compared to the previous iterations.In the same interview, Mustafa Suleyman outlined Microsoft’s approach to “humanist superintelligence”—AI systems strictly designed to serve human interests rather than operate autonomously.“We won’t continue to develop a system that has the potential to run away from us,” he stated, emphasizing that containment and alignment are “necessary prerequisites” and “red lines” before releasing superintelligent tools.Suleyman also warned that the Redmond giant will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” staking out what he calls a “novel position” in an industry racing toward superintelligence. The announcement comes as Microsoft gains newfound independence to develop AI following a revised agreement with OpenAI.","Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Google’s Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’ In the same interview, he outlined his approach to ‘humanist superintelligence’ Microsoft will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” he stated.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126036637,imgsize-27400,width-400,resizemode-4/microsoft-ai-ceo-mustafa-suleyman.jpg"

“self-driving technology could be useful in ways the world has yet to imagine, creating many new types of products, jobs, and services.”

""new jobs""

What Americans said about earning from this Waymo ‘gig work’

“$22 to $24”

“$60 to $80”

“We have temporarily suspended our ride-hailing services given the broad power outage in San Francisco. We are focused on keeping our riders safe and ensuring emergency personnel have the clear access they need to do their work,”

""We've always focused on developing the Waymo Driver for the world as it is, including when infrastructure fails.

We are analysing the event and are already integrating the lessons from this weekend's PG&E outage.”

""immediate steps""





A new type of gig work has emerged in the US self-driving car industry. The Google-owned Waymo robotaxi service is paying Americans roughly $22 just to close the doors of autonomous vehicles. While Waymo was initially launched to eliminate the need for human drivers, the technology has created unexpected manual labour tasks for local workers. According to a report by The Washington Post, tow truck operators are now using an app called Honk to pick up small maintenance jobs for the autonomous fleet.These new roles fulfil a prediction made nearly a decade ago. In a 2016 press release, Waymo’s ex-CEO John Krafcik wrote thatNine years later, thoseinclude simple physical tasks that the robot cars cannot perform themselves, such as securing a door that a passenger left open or moving a vehicle that has stalled.Despite the convenience of app-based work, some business owners describe it as difficult. Tow company owner Evangelica Cuevas explained that her drivers are offeredto close Waymo doors and betweento tow the vehicles when they run out of power or experience technical issues.This specialised work often arises when a vehicle gets stuck while looking for a charging station, leaving workers to handle the physical problems the software cannot solve. These situations also occur when the robotaxis become inoperable due to technical faults or natural calamities.Earlier this week, a massive power outage affected nearly 30% of San Francisco, plunging the city into darkness for hours, paralysing its infrastructure and leaving hundreds of Google-owned Waymo self-driving vehicles stranded in the middle of busy roads. Social media users posted videos and photos of Waymo vehicles stuck in the middle of roads and disrupting traffic flows.According to a report by SFGate, Waymo was forced to suspend operations for several hours after the vehicles became unable to safely navigate intersections without functioning traffic signals.a Waymo spokesperson said at that time.Later, the company announced that it would implement a fleet-wide update to help its cars make safer, quicker decisions during power outages like the one in San Francisco. This came after many Waymo cars were spotted stranded on the road, while Elon Musk claimed that rival Tesla cars kept rolling during that outage.In the blog post, the company wrote,Waymo also outlined the threeit was taking to avoid such situations in the coming days. This includes integrating more information about outages, updating emergency preparedness and response, and expanding first responder engagement.More recently, Waymo paused its robotaxi service in San Francisco once again. This time, the company reportedly sent a notification to customers through its app stating, “Service temporarily paused due to National Weather Service flash flood warning.” The National Weather Service had extended a flood watch for the entire San Francisco Bay Area through Friday, December 26, at 10 pm local time.","Google-owned Waymo robotaxi service is paying Americans roughly $22 just to close the doors of autonomous vehicles. Tow truck operators are using an app called Honk to pick up small maintenance jobs for the autonomous fleet. This specialised work often arises when a vehicle gets stuck while looking for a charging station, leaving workers to handle the physical problems the software cannot solve.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126192039,imgsize-58570,width-400,resizemode-4/how-some-americans-are-earning-by-helping-googles-waymo-robotaxis.jpg"
Amazon’s Alexa chief predicts 'death' of app experience on your smartphones,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/amazons-alexa-chief-predicts-death-of-app-experience-on-your-smartphones/articleshow/126191117.cms,"Panos Panay, senior vice president of devices and services at Amazon

Panos Panay: Shift to ‘ ambient intelligence ’ coming soon







Panos Panay, Amazon ’s head of devices and services, has predicted a big change in consumer technology. According to the executive, the current tech like smartphones and apps is approaching a tipping point due to social media and the rise of generative AI. He said that young generation will consume technology ‘without screens’ and defined by “ambient intelligence”.Speaking at the Fortune Brainstorm AI conference, Panay said Panay says we are looking at “ambient” future where technology fades into the background of daily life as the next generation of users is growing tired of “doom scrolling”.“There’s a whole younger generation coming up that I think at some point they get tired of doom scrolling,” he said, adding, “They’re going to just think differently. You’ve got to make sure you have products in their pockets, on their bodies, in their homes that they don’t expect… [but] expect to connect seamlessly.”According to Panay, the future of AI isn't about building a better app but about making the app experience disappear entirely.“It’s such a joy because there’s no opening a phone, opening the app, clicking, finding… none of it. You just ask the question and you get it back,” Panay observed.Panay said that Amazon is working towards that future by incorporating a better Alexa into its products while suggesting that the ultimate form factor for an AI assistant has not yet been created for public.“I don’t think we’ve seen the next form factor yet on where AI devices are going to go,” he said, adding that Amazon has a “lab full of ideas.”When questioned about potential competitors, like the rumored AI hardware by OpenAI and legendary designer Jony Ive, Panay pointed to Amazon’s existing portfolio of wearables, including the Echo Frames and earbuds.“I think you’re going to want your assistant with you everywhere you go,” he added.While talking on security, Panay said that this is an aspect that is non-negotiable.“I feel like it’s a contract with our customers, period. We break that contract, we lose our customers,” he emphasised.","Panos Panay, Amazon’s head of devices and services, has predicted a big change in consumer technology.

American billionaire Mark Cuban to new grads: You need to join small companies and teach them how to use AI agents as big companies don’t ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/american-billionaire-mark-cuban-to-new-grads-you-need-to-join-small-companies-and-teach-them-how-to-use-ai-agents-as-big-companies-dont-/articleshow/126190364.cms,"Why AI agents matter

A Jellyfish study found adoption of agentic AI among 400 companies jumped from 50% in December 2024 to 82% in May 2025.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang declared earlier this year that “the age of agentic AI is here.”

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman likened AI agents to “junior employees.”

Morgan Stanley projects AI shopping agents could add $115 billion to U.S. e-commerce by 2030.

Mark Cuban advice young engineers to not go behind big companies





American billionaire and Shark Tank investor Mark Cuban has now shared a new message for the fresh graduates: skip the big corporations and head to small and medium sized businesses. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Cuban argued that small companies are the place where fresh graduates can add most value mainly by them in adopting AI agents. “New grads can teach SMBs how to use agents to optimize processes they couldn’t take the time or afford to do manually,” Cuban wrote. “Big companies don’t need new grads for this. Entrepreneurial companies will love the value you add.”AI agents are autonomous digital assistants capable of completing tasks end-to-end without constant user prompts. They’re increasingly seen as transformative for business operations:Cuban believes this is precisely where new graduates can step in, teaching smaller firms how to integrate AI agents into workflows they previously lacked the resources to optimize.Recently, Cuban urged the young engineers entering the job market to prioritise small and medium-sized companies over multinational corporations (MNCs) when seeking opportunities in artificial intelligence (AI).Cuban feels that smaller companies offer better platform for new graduates to make an immediate impact, while large corporations often dilute individual contributions.Speaking in an interview with CNBC and on his podcast The Dumbest Guy in the Room, Cuban explained that smaller companies are mainly entrepreneur-driven and they lack the deep IT departments or larger corporations. This gap creates opportunities for fresh graduates which directly contribute to the AI projects. “Small- to medium-size companies don’t have that depth. They are typically entrepreneurially driven and don’t have the flexibility to have people research things. Bringing a new graduate on to work on agentic AI projects is inexpensive for them and can get them immediate results,” Cuban said.Cuban also used the example of his own company, Cost Plus Drugs, noting how AI can automate processes to boost productivity, competitiveness, and profitability.","Mark Cuban urges young engineers to not go behind big companies for AI opportunities.
