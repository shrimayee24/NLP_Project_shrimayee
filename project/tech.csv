AI lends a new tech touch to campaigns this assembly poll,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ai-lends-a-new-tech-touch-to-campaigns-this-assembly-poll/articleshow/115124559.cms,"In a first-of-its-kind campaign, social media lit up with cinematic AI-powered election ads from Maharashtra's deputy CM Ajit Pawar that racked up thousands of views and plenty of chatter.In one video, a young girl in a village takes a break from household chores under a tree when a newspaper lands on her lap with a headline promising free education for girls from modest backgrounds, with Pawar's face beside the headline. In a flash, she is in a crisp school uniform, pedalling off to class. Another ad depicts an anxious mother as her cooking gas flickers out with hungry kids waiting until a billboard outside catches her eye, promising three free gas cylinders each year. Both videos close with Pawar's reassuring voice: ""Your brother always keeps his word,"" followed by a call to vote for NCP 's clock symbol.The response to these AI-generated scenes and characters has been split - some praised it as ""bold and historic,"" while others joked it felt ""like a cartoon"". Either way, tech is clearly front and centre this election season, with political parties pulling out all kinds of tech tricks - AI-powered characters, hyper-personalised messages, tap cards, QR codes, and podcasts-to shape their campaign playbook.NCP insiders say that the use of AI marks a shift towards a ""data-driven"" approach that resonates particularly well with younger voters and grabs eyeballs. ""AI has helped simplify complex processes and saved us a lot of time,"" a party source says, adding that promotional audiovisual material that once required multiple tools-voiceover artistes, animation, camera work, and graphics-are now tackled at one go.BJP, on the other hand, is keeping AI at arm's length, using faces and voices of ""real benefactors that we've interviewed over the last two years"", says Sujay Patki , spokesperson for BJP Maharashtra, about opting out of the AI frenzy. ""Yes, it cuts costs, but AI-generated content can be unconvincing for the public and tends to create disbelief-no real people, no actual beneficiaries,"" says Patki , recalling the backlash BJP faced in Madhya Pradesh when AI imagery was used in their 'Ladki Bahin' campaign duringLok Sabha elections. ""People asked why AI was needed if the schemes genuinely benefited real girls and women. At times, we hesitate to use actual photos over concern about misrepresentation. But creating disbelief is worse,"" he says.NCP, however, insists that AI has stepped up its personal touch, and besides the videos, they are also harnessing it to create hyper-personalised messages that greet voters by name. ""We're collecting details like names and ages from households during door-to-door campaigns. Once this data is fed into the system, AI generates tailor-made messages that reach voters directly via WhatsApp or automated calls with Ajit-dada addressing people while delivering a message for a personal touch,"" explains a party insider.The risk, Patki says, is that AI's ""picture-perfect"" visuals often feel staged, out of sync with reality. ""The colours, the voices-all create a false impression that regular people can't connect with,"" he argues. However, NCP insists AI is less about showing off tech and more about connecting with people in a whole new way. ""One of our AI-created videos featuring Dada at Ganpati Visarjan got over a million views in no time. It's new, it's different, and it's getting people talking.""To stand out in a media landscape saturated with flashy visuals and speeches, BJP has decided to turn to podcasts and 'tap cards' as fresh tools. Launched on Monday, its new podcast series 'Nakki Kay Challay?' (what exactly is happening?) hosted by senior leader Vinay Sahasrabuddhe , is adding heft to its poll campaign. Each 30-minute episode-which breaks down key issues like rural development, agriculture, and women's empowerment with party leaders and subject experts-has been trimmed to bite-sized shareable clips for quick scrolls on social media.The lineup includes legal heavyweight Ujjwal Nikam, who in his segment recalls former CM and current deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis' role in securing David Headley's deposition before the Indian court. The podcasts will also feature Marathi writer Sadananda More, Dalit Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry founder Milind Kamble, rural development expert Popat Pawar, Pasha Patel, a farmer leader and MLA who's been vocal about agricultural issues, and party faces like Smriti Irani and Fadnavis. Shiv Sena (UBT), too, is banking on the power of podcasts, a tactic that has served it well, and is in talks with Aaditya Thackeray to plan upcoming episodes. ""Podcasts worked really well for us for last Lok Sabha campaign,"" says a party insider. ""They let us dive deeper into issues and reach audiences in a way that feels more engaging and conversational.""Meanwhile, BJP has rolled out NFC-enabled tap cards as part of its door-to-door strategy, for an interactive twist. A quick smartphone tap on the card leads to a webpage where citzens can submit ideas for the party's manifesto. ""Available in English and Marathi, this lets voters feel heard and also helps the party track trends in the state to shape its policies,"" explains Vinay Punamiya, who heads IT and social media for BJP's youth wing in the state. The card isn't a one-off either. After the manifesto phase, it will be reprogrammed with fresh updates so that the voter connection doesn't end after polling day.Taking personalisation further, Shiv Sena (UBT) candidates are now using AI tools to create customised video messages that allow candidates to speak to people directly, says Sainath Durge , the party's secretary, adding that their newly launched 'pocket manifesto'-a mini, QR-coded handout-is another tech tool in their arsenal that candidates and party workers are carrying.Not to be left out, NCP too has added QR codes to its manifesto, allowing voters to scan and instantly access Pawar's manifesto, social media channels, and other updates. ""Even our vans are QR-coded-one scan and voters are in.""","NCP is using AI to create hyper-personalised messages that greet voters by name.

Notre Dame's bells ring for first time after 5 years of silence since catastrophic fire,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/notre-dames-bells-ring-for-first-time-after-5-years-of-silence-since-catastrophic-fire/articleshow/115103381.cms,"Notre Dame bells

For the first time since the devastating fire of 2019, the eight bells of Notre Dame Cathedral rang in unison on Friday. The bells, housed in the northern belfry, were silenced after the fire ravaged the iconic landmark.Five years of extensive efforts have brought the cathedral closer to its former glory. The fire's damage to the northern belfry necessitated comprehensive restoration, including removal, cleaning and reinstallation of the bells.The bells chimed individually before harmonising for roughly five minutes, marking as milestone moment ahead of the cathedral's reopening, scheduled for next month. Philippe Jost, who oversees the restoration project, said, ""This is a beautiful, important and symbolic step.""The bells rang individually before joining in harmony for approximately five minutes. This test run precedes the official reopening ceremonies planned for December 7 and 8.Alexandre Gougeon, responsible for the bells' reinstallation, acknowledged: ""It's not perfect yet, but we will make it perfect."" He confirmed to AFP that the initial test was successful.Guillaume Normand, the cathedral's vice rector, expressed profound emotion upon hearing the bells' chorus, noting: ""It's November 8 and Notre Dame is telling us: 'I'm here, waiting for you'.""The bells vary significantly in weight, from ""Gabriel"" at over four tonnes to ""Jean-Marie"" at 800 kilogrammes.The cathedral's reopening celebrations are scheduled for December 7 and 8. Whilst specific programme details remain unpublished, Jost informed RTL that performances would feature ""great artists of international standing.""Reports suggest Paul McCartney, who has Paris concerts scheduled for December 4 and 5, might participate in the reopening festivities.Post-reopening, Notre Dame anticipates 14 to 15 million annual visitors, an increase from 12 million in 2017.The catastrophic fire in April 2019, shocked both Parisians and global onlookers as the UNESCO heritage site was engulfed in flames, resulting in the collapse of its iconic spire.President Emmanuel Macron had established a five-year timeline for reconstruction, aiming to restore the cathedral to surpass its former glory.","The eight bells of Notre Dame Cathedral rang in unison for the first time since the devastating fire of 2019.

Factors affecting your CIBIL score

CIBIL credit score : Understanding your creditworthiness is pivotal in today's financial landscape, especially when seeking loans or credit cards. The Credit Information Bureau (India) Limited, commonly known as CIBIL, plays an important role in this regard by providing credit scores to borrowers.According to ET, credit score helps banks make informed decisions about extending credit cards and loans.Your credit history influences your CIBIL score , which is calculated using a special method.Your CIBIL score is a three-digit number that reflects your creditworthiness and repayment capacity. Ranging from 300 to 900, a higher score indicates a stronger likelihood of loan approval. Banks and financial institutions use this score to assess the risk associated with lending money.1. Go to the official CIBIL website and click on 'Personal CIBIL score,' then 'Get Your Free CIBIL score.' Follow the link provided and fill in all the required details.2. If you don’t have a PAN Card, you can use an alternative identification such as Passport, Voter ID, Driver’s License, or Ration Card. Enter the number of the chosen ID.3. Provide your date of birth, PIN code, and select your state. Finally, enter your mobile number and click on ‘Accept and Continue’.4. Authenticate your identity by entering the OTP (One-Time Password) delivered to your mobile device on the next screen. Click 'Continue' to proceed.5. Choose whether you want to link the device with your account. Select 'Yes' or 'No' based on your preference.6. Upon successful registration, you will see a page confirming that 'You have successfully registered!'7. Click on ‘Go to Dashboard’ to access and view your CIBIL score.The factors influencing the new CIBIL score, as stated on the CIBIL website, include:1. Depth of credit: This refers to the duration of your existing credit history, calculated from the opening date of your oldest credit account.2. Long-term trend of outstanding balances: The overall trend of outstanding balances over time affects your score.3. Transaction history on credit cards: How you manage transactions on your credit cards impacts your score.4. Ratio of actual repayment amount to total amount due: This ratio indicates your repayment behavior and influences your score accordingly.5. Number of new accounts opened and number of accounts closed: Opening or closing accounts can affect your score, so managing these actions wisely is important.","Your CIBIL score is a three-digit number that reflects your creditworthiness and repayment capacity.

Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109067339,imgsize-51000,width-400,resizemode-4/109067339.jpg"

Starting April 1, all users logging into the Central Record-keeping Agency (CRA) system with passwords must use this feature, as per the PFRDA circular dated March 15, 2024.According to ET, using two-factor authentication greatly lowers the risk of unauthorised access to the CRA system . This added layer ensures the safety of NPS transactions and protects the interests of subscribers and stakeholders.The login process for NPS CRAs is changing.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

On the other hand, Royal Enfield has also enhanced experience at its outlets, which are now positioned more as ""lifestyle destinations"" with a separate line of accessories and merchandise, which include high-quality biking gear and clothing.Toyota has also opened separate 'guest experience centres' (GECs) for retailing its luxury brand Lexus.

Now married for 47 years, the couple has become one of India’s most respected duos, with Sudha Murty achieving acclaim as an author, Rajya Sabha member, and philanthropist.When Kapil Sharma humorously questioned whether their habits have grown similar over the years, Sudha Murty responded with her characteristic humor and honesty. “I became a workaholic like him and a stickler for time,” she shared, adding, “I cook so badly, but he never complains.

Google’s experimental AI assistant, codenamed ""Jarvis,"" has been reportedly leaked to the public through the Chrome Web Store. According to a report by The Information, the Chrome Web Store page for Jarvis describes it as a ""helpful companion that surfs the web for you."" The prototype was briefly available on the Chrome Web Store before being taken down by the company. While the leaked version was not fully functional, its description hinted at advanced capabilities like web browsing and task automation.Google is planning to reveal Jarvis in December. The AI assistant is expected to compete with rivals like Anthropic's Claude, which can perform complex tasks such as typing text and controlling a computer's cursor. While Google has not officially announced Jarvis, its accidental appearance on the Chrome Web Store offers a glimpse into the company's ongoing AI development efforts. It remains to be seen when or if Jarvis will be officially released to the public.This AI prototype goes beyond basic tasks like setting reminders or checking the weather, offering more advanced capabilities like browsing the web and completing tasks such as buying groceries, booking flights, and conducting research. This suggests a more sophisticated level of AI assistance than what is currently available in mainstream virtual assistants.Jarvis is designed to streamline web-based tasks by integrating with the Chrome browser. It can analyse web pages, interpret user instructions, and perform actions like clicking buttons and typing text, though its speed is currently being optimised.Jarvis joins a growing field of AI-powered automation tools being developed by tech giants like Microsoft (Copilot Vision), Apple (Apple Intelligence), Anthropic (Claude), and OpenAI (ChatGPT). These tools aim to simplify digital tasks and enhance productivity through natural language interaction and automated actions.While Jarvis shows promise in its ability to automate web-based tasks, its final form and public availability remain uncertain.

What Bengaluru police said about this app



“We want to integrate the Public Eye and other services into a single app. Even the traffic police will start using the app with added features to report road incidents. They (the agency) will make a digital map of the city that we can use to simulate projects such as road closures or changing one-ways without inconveniencing people. If the simulation shows better results, we want to implement those changes.”

“All work orders will be finalised by the end of this month and works will be completed by January,”

Bengaluru commuters may soon have a ""one-stop"" solution for all traffic updates. The Bengaluru Traffic Police is reportedly planning to launch the ASTraM (Actionable Intelligence for Sustainable Traffic Management) super-app within the next two months. This app will provide real-time traffic congestion updates and will even allow users to report accidents.The app aims to eliminate the need for relying on multiple navigation apps or social media for traffic information. According to a report by Deccan Herald, users will be able to report violations and accidents on this app by submitting images without revealing their personal information.However, this new app will be different from the existing ASTraM app, which is exclusively for traffic police to monitor and analyse traffic patterns. The upcoming public version is expected to cover the entire city, expanding from the current simulation model that covers 21 major traffic corridors.In a statement to Deccan Herald, the Joint Commissioner of Police (Traffic) M N Anucheth said the new ""one-stop"" super-app will offer several useful features for commuters, including real-time traffic congestion alerts within a 5-kilometre radius, the ability to report accidents and a convenient way to view and pay traffic fines.JCP Anucheth said:The traffic police will also hire eligible agencies to create microsimulation models of the city within the next three months. This will enable them to model individual vehicle movement to assess the traffic, down to a street level, to manage it better.The Bengaluru Traffic Police's super-app is part of a broader initiative to improve traffic management in the city. This initiative includes various projects, such as procuring new signboards, solar blinkers, body-worn cameras, and cat's eyes to enhance road safety. Tenders for these projects were released in October, and work is currently underway, JCP Anucheth noted.he added.",Bengaluru Traffic Police is reportedly planning to launch the ASTraM super-app within the next two months.

WWE seems to have some big plans for the Wyatt Sicks

For months now, The Wyatt Sicks have been one of the most menacing factions in WWE . Consisting of Uncle Howdy, Erick Rowan, Dexter Lumis, Joe Gacy and Nikki Cross have been on an absolute tear lately. Now, months after their in-ring debut and reveal, Bo Dallas has finally shared the inspiration behind the Wyatt Sicks. Let’s take a look at what Bo had to say during his conversation with Chris McPherson from Collider:“Growing up, me and Windham were obsessed with horror movie…One of our biggest influences was the ’90s version of ‘The Stand’ by Stephen King. We both loved that, and it’s funny because when we were coming up with ideas for characters, we both independently decided to draw inspiration from Randall Flagg without even realizing the other was doing it.”Both Bo and Bray had some innovative ideas after watching Stephen King’s The Stand. In fact, the two were so intrigued by it that they each decided to split different parts of Flagg’s mentality and use it to their advantage in their wrestling career. Now that we know the inspiration behind them, let’s take a look at what plans WWE have in mind for the Wyatt Sicks.Also Read: WWE superstar CM Punk welcomes new WWE ID signings On the latest episode of WWE Raw, the fans were completely shocked when they saw that the Wyatt Sicks kidnapped the former WWE Champion, The Miz.

It’ll be interesting to see whether someone will rise to the occasion and attempt to rescue The Miz, for all we know it could be his estranged friend R-Truth.On the other hand, the Wyatt Sicks could beat The Miz to a pulp before releasing him. So, The Wyatt Sicks will likely have their hands full as we head into this week’s episode of Friday Night SmackDown.

WWE Hall of Famer, Bubba Ray Dudley, has claimed credit for helping WWE NXT defeat AEW Dynamite’s viewership numbers on 11/6. The November 6 episode of NXT saw Bully Ray team up with NXT Champion Trick Williams to take on Ridge Holland and Ethan Page. While Bully Ray and Williams ended up losing the match, they still managed to put up quite an entertaining performance.Thanks to their efforts in the ring, NXT drew in a total of 619,000 viewers with a 0.17 rating in the 18-49 demographic. On the other hand, WWE’s competitors, AEW Dynamite could only manage to draw in a total of 523,000 viewers with a 0.16 rating in the 18-49 demographic. As of right now, NXT is making it look like child’s work when it comes to defeating AEW in viewership.After the 11/6 episode, Bully Ray was quick to take to X where he shared a photo of himself, Trick Williams and D-Von Dudley who also made a shocking appearance. At the top of the image Bully Ray simply wrote “Demo Gods” thus implying that his, Trick and D-Von’s efforts helped NXT defeat AEW Dynamite.Also Read: WWE superstar CM Punk welcomes new WWE ID signings This also seems to be a dig at Chris Jericho, who would constantly call himself the “Demo God” every time AEW Dynamite managed to beat NXT in viewership. As the months grow by, AEW’s viewership only continues to decline and is currently showing no signs of recovering. Things are so bad that even their live events are being held in almost empty arenas.If Tony Khan doesn’t soon figure out a way to put an end to Dynamite’s viewership wars, we might get to see the brand or AEW as a whole disappear into nothingness. NXT has been bang on with their programming and will likely continue to get better numbers than AEW Dynamite.

Edelman’s Legacy: A Player Who Never Backed Down

In a recent episode of, his popular podcast, former NFL star Julian Edelman shed light on a less glamorous part of the league: its relentless fine system. Known for his grit and willingness to tackle any challenge on the field, Edelman opened up about the toll that fines, suspensions, and the NFL's disciplinary process took on him during his 11-year career with the New England Patriots.Also read - ""Machine Gun Kelly’s Munich Halftime Show: Here’s Why U.S. Fans Won’t See It Live and Where U.S. Fans Can Catch MGK’s Munich Halftime Show Highlights"" Edelman, who had a reputation as a hard-hitting, all-in player, shared insights into how the league’s fine process works. He described the “friendly fire” nature of the hearings, in which former players-turned-NFL officials play a significant role. ""When you get fined… the NFL sets you up with some guy—a former player. So, it’s like a friendly fire type sh-t,” Edelman said. Despite his attempts to appeal, he revealed that it rarely made a difference, joking that no amount of “buttering up” these former players seemed to reduce his penalties.Michael Bennett, an NFL legend and guest on the podcast, echoed Edelman's frustrations. “Those fine people, they get paid pretty good money, man,” he added, shedding light on the seemingly self-sustaining nature of the system.Edelman described the fine process as feeling almost prison-like, where he felt judged by “the prisoner judging if you’re going to get in or not.” And the costs? Not small change. Over his NFL career, Edelman accumulated more than $1 million in fines, including a $63,504 hit for rough play in a single 2018 game against the Buffalo Bills. The biggest blow, however, came that same year when he was suspended for violating the league’s PED policy, a punishment that slashed $1 million from his salary and bonuses.“It was brutal,” Edelman shared. “When you start seeing the numbers add up, it stings. You go out to play, to push yourself, and sometimes it comes back at you.” While he’s able to laugh about it now, Edelman’s stories highlight the immense financial pressure players can face under the league’s fine system.Edelman’s career was built on pushing limits, and fines weren’t the only sacrifices he made. Known for a willingness to put his body on the line, Edelman frequently played through injuries, defying what most players would consider acceptable risks. In 2019, he famously played with torn rib cartilage, refusing to sit out despite the pain.Tom Brady, Edelman’s longtime teammate, has often praised Edelman’s relentless style. “He plays much bigger than his frame, and that provides a huge benefit for our team,” Brady once said, capturing what set Edelman apart from other wideouts. Not the tallest or the fastest on the field, Edelman’s advantage came from his sheer resilience—a quality that often led him into situations where the risk of fines or injury was high.Edelman’s standout moments on the field include more than a few plays where he chose power over caution. One such defining play came during a playoff game against the Chargers, where, instead of sidestepping a linebacker, he plowed into him, fighting for every yard.For Edelman, that level of grit was worth any fine. It was about proving his toughness, his dedication, and his value to his team. Reflecting on the cost, Edelman acknowledged that fines were just part of the game for him, a price he was willing to pay to give his all.Despite the fines, suspensions, and grueling injuries, Edelman remains a celebrated figure in NFL history, respected for his tenacity and work ethic. The league’s fine system may have cost him financially, but in his own words, “It’s all part of the game. After all, where’s the fun in playing it safe?”With Edelman’s story now out in the open, his fans and followers gain a rare glimpse into what NFL players face off the field. As the league continues to refine its policies, stories like his highlight the balancing act between enforcing rules and supporting the very players who make the sport so captivating.Also read - Hailee Steinfeld’s Bold New Project Amid Josh Allen’s Stellar Season: Ex-Girlfriend Shares a Touching Confession","Julian Edelman opened up about the toll that fines, suspensions and the NFL's disciplinary process took on him during his 11-year career with the New England Patriots.

This performance marks the NFL’s final international game of the 2024 season, and MGK is expected to perform his latest hit, ""Lonely Road,"" which pays homage to John Denver’s iconic song “Take Me Home, Country Roads.” This choice isn’t accidental—Denver’s song is a fan favorite in Germany, making it a fitting anthem for the event.Also read - Hailee Steinfeld’s Bold New Project Amid Josh Allen’s Stellar Season: Ex-Girlfriend Shares a Touching Confession For fans in Germany, the halftime show will air live on RTL and will be available on the NFL’s World Feed.

However, NFL Network will feature highlights post-game, and the NFL’s social media channels will also release clips for U.S.-based fans.The decision to restrict live broadcasting to German fans keeps the halftime show focused on entertaining the stadium crowd. Despite this, U.S. fans will still get a taste through highlights and online updates, allowing the NFL to share the excitement while keeping the experience special for those in attendance.Not all fans are thrilled with the NFL’s entertainment choice. Some have voiced frustration on social media, questioning MGK’s fit for an international event and pointing to other artists they feel would better resonate with fans abroad. Some fans also believe that the NFL should bring in more high-energy games and carefully chosen entertainers to engage an international audience as the league continues its global expansion.With plans to expand to eight international games in 2025, the NFL’s choices for entertainment and game matchups are crucial in building overseas interest. The mixed reactions to MGK’s performance underscore the delicate balance the league must strike as it juggles fan expectations across cultures, entertainment styles, and sporting traditions.Also read - ""He was the only one"": Chiefs RB shares how Kelce helped him overcome PTSD","Machine Gun Kelly is set to headline the halftime show for the New York Giants vs. Carolina Panthers game at Munich’s Allianz Arena on November 10.

DeVonta Smith vs. CeeDee Lamb: Which receiver to start?



As the fantasy football season heats up, every decision counts more than ever. With standout receivers like DeVonta Smith and CeeDee Lamb vying for top spots in a highly competitive division, fantasy managers are feeling the pressure to make the right call. Add in other big names like Malik Nabers, A.J. Brown, and Terry McLaurin, and it’s clear that Week 10 is crucial for those hoping to clinch a playoff spot. For managers stuck between Smith and Lamb, the choice can be daunting—but fear not, we’ve got the breakdown you need.Also Read: ""He was the only one"": Chiefs RB shares how Kelce helped him overcome PTSD DeVonta Smith and CeeDee Lamb stand out as two of the top receivers in a surprisingly stacked division. With names like Malik Nabers, A.J. Brown, and Terry McLaurin also in the mix, fantasy managers had no shortage of standout options to choose from earlier in the season.But as the fantasy football regular season enters its final stretch, the pressure to make the right lineup choices is higher than ever. For managers torn between Smith and Lamb, the decision can feel overwhelming.With these two elite wide receivers set to face off in Week 10, fantasy owners will soon know whether they made the right call. Here’s a closer look at both players and some advice for making the best Week 10 decision.A.J. Brown's health has been a lingering concern all season, creating a prime opportunity for Smith to step up against the Cowboys this week. According to Sportskeeda's Start/Sit Optimizer, Smith is primed for a strong, borderline WR1 performance, making him a top contender for your lineup.Even with A.J. Brown potentially back on the field, there's no guarantee he'll overshadow Smith's role. Smith has consistently risen to the challenge this season, so his opportunity remains solid regardless of Brown's status.CeeDee Lamb, the Dallas Cowboys' top wide receiver, finds himself in a similar situation to A.J. Brown. Although Lamb is set to play this week, there are concerns after he appeared to limp last week, leaving uncertainty about whether he'll be at 100%. According to Sportskeeda's Start/Sit Optimizer, Lamb is projected to earn 16.5 points. Despite the limp, when the ball is snapped, Lamb is expected to power through. Additionally, Cooper Rush stepping in for Dak Prescott shouldn't significantly affect Lamb's production.Both receivers have their advantages and drawbacks this week, but according to Sportskeeda's Start/Sit Optimizer, CeeDee Lamb gets the slight edge. Lamb is projected to score 16.5 points, compared to Smith's 15.8. A.J. Brown’s presence is expected to slightly hinder Smith, keeping him behind Lamb in projections. While Lamb may not be fully healthy and could be working with a backup quarterback, this doesn't impact his outlook significantly more than Smith's situation.Also Read: Christian McCaffrey says he's ""Ready to Go"" for Week 10 clash against the Buccaneers","DeVonta Smith and CeeDee Lamb are two of the top receivers in a stacked division.

DeAndre Hopkins' impact on the Kansas City Chiefs' offense



The Kansas City Chiefs' acquisition of DeAndre Hopkins from the Tennessee Titans was a strategic move to bolster their offensive arsenal. With a string of injuries depleting their receiving corps, the arrival of Hopkins provided a much-needed boost. Hopkins seamlessly integrated into Andy Reid's offensive system, making an immediate impact. In his debut, he recorded two receptions for 29 yards, followed by a stellar performance against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, where he hauled in eight passes for 86 yards and two touchdowns.Also Read: Eagles’ Nick Sirianni accidentally reveals Jalen Hurts’ ankle concern, raising questions before week 10 For Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, integrating Hopkins into the offense was always going to be a straightforward task. ""You just continue to get him more and more comfortable within the offense,"" Mahomes explained. ""He had a big game this last game [vs. Bucs] but we continue to give him more and more opportunities to make plays and we move him around and let him do what he's special at. It's just going to help the entire offense not only for him but helping other guys get open as well and with the big game that he had this last game, I'm sure there'll be more eyes on him this week which will in turn help other guys get open.""As Hopkins finds his rhythm in the Chiefs' high-powered offense, other players like Travis Kelce , JuJu Smith-Schuster (when he returns from injury), and Skyy Moore are expected to benefit from more favorable matchups. The attention Hopkins attracts will undoubtedly open up more opportunities for his teammates to shine.Hopkins' skills fit perfectly within Reid's offensive system, and his ability to dominate a game after just a couple of weeks is a promising sign for the Chiefs' future. With Kansas City sitting at 8-0, opposing defenses, like Denver's Vance Joseph, will have a tough task in slowing down Mahomes and his arsenal of weapons—an arsenal that still includes running back Kareem Hunt.In essence, Hopkins' presence on the field does more than just generate big plays. He opens up the offense, creating a dynamic and dangerous passing attack that could be difficult to contain for any team. Mahomes now has a true No. 1 receiver, and that’s a nightmare for the rest of the NFL.Also Read: Christian McCaffrey excited for 49ers season debut against Buccaneers, leaving ‘Tough’ time behind","The Kansas City Chiefs' acquisition of DeAndre Hopkins from the Tennessee Titans was a strategic move to bolster their offensive arsenal.
