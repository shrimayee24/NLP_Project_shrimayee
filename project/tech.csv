Antonio Brown claims Jay-Z controls the halftime stage



Bad Bunny frames the performance as a cultural victory

The balance of power and purpose at the NFL’s biggest stage

The NFL ’s announcement that Bad Bunny will headline the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show has sparked excitement across music and sports. But while fans celebrate the Puerto Rican superstar’s historic booking, former NFL wide receiver Antonio Brown is questioning how these selections are actually made—and pointing directly at Jay-Z.Antonio Brown took to X (formerly Twitter) to allege that Jay-Z, through his company Roc Nation, plays the decisive role in choosing halftime acts. He wrote: ""Barack Obama's best friend Jay-Z runs the Super Bowl selection process through his company Roc Nation which has an exclusive contract with the NFL. This is who chooses the halftime show, the most watched musical performance in America.""His claim adds weight to ongoing discussions about how much power Roc Nation holds in shaping one of the biggest entertainment moments in the world. Since 2019, Jay-Z has officially partnered with the NFL as its “live music entertainment strategist,” and Roc Nation has served as co-producer of halftime productions. Industry insiders, including producer Jesse Collins, have even said: “It’s a decision that Jay makes. Since we’ve been onboard with that show, he’s made it every year, and it’s been amazing. He’s always picked right.”Still, some analysts argue the process involves multiple layers of input, including the NFL, host cities, and broadcast partners.While Jay-Z may not have absolute control, his influence is undeniable.Amid the speculation, Bad Bunny himself is focused less on politics and more on representation. In his statement, he explained: “What I'm feeling goes beyond myself. It's for those who came before me and ran countless yards so I could come in and score a touchdown. This is for my people, my culture and our history. Ve y dile a tu abuela, que seremos el HALFTIME SHOW DEL SUPER BOWL.”For him, the halftime stage is not just a career milestone but a chance to highlight Latin culture on one of the most-watched platforms in the world.From Brown’s sharp claims about behind-the-scenes control to Bad Bunny’s emotional emphasis on cultural pride, the halftime show conversation reflects more than just music. It is about power, representation, and identity.Also Read: Is Bad Bunny bringing Latin flair to Apple Music 2026 Super Bowl Halftime Show?

What OpenAI says





Elon Musk-owned AI software company, xAI has filed a lawsuit against Sam Altman-led OpenAI , accusing it of stealing its trade secrets. The lawsuit, filed in a federal court in California, says that OpenAI was engaged in a “deeply troubling pattern” of hiring away former xAI employees to gain access to trade secrets. It further accuses OpenAI of pursuing unfair advantage in the AI race. In the lawsuit, xAI names four former engineers – Xuechen Li who is involved in a separate trade secrets lawsuit, Jimmy Fraiture and a senior finance executive.“OpenAI is targeting those individuals with knowledge of xAI’s key technologies and business plans, including xAI’s source code and its operational advantages in launching data centers, then inducing those employees to breach their confidentiality and other obligations to xAI through unlawful means,” the lawsuit states.“By hook or by crook, OpenAI clearly will do anything when threatened by a better innovator, including plundering and misappropriating the technical advancements, source code, and business plans of xAI,” the lawsuit claims.“OpenAI is not merely soliciting or hiring a competitor’s employees. OpenAI is waging a coordinated, unfair, and unlawful campaign: OpenAI is targeting those individuals with knowledge of xAI’s key technologies and business plans—including xAI’s source code and its operational advantages in launching data centers—then inducing those employees to breach their confidentiality and other obligations to xAI through unlawful means,” it states.OpenAI has rejected the allegations, dismissing the lawsuit as “the latest chapter in Mr. Musk’s ongoing harassment.”Notably, Elon Musk has had a complex relationship with OpenAI — from co-founding the company with Sam Altman and Greg Brockman, to becoming one of its strongest critics and now a business rival.In August, Musk filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and Apple, accusing Apple of giving ChatGPT preferential treatment in App Store rankings.Musk has also taken OpenAI to court, alleging it put profits ahead of its original mission of developing AI for humanity’s benefit. OpenAI, in turn, has countersued Musk, accusing him of harassment."," xAI has filed a lawsuit against Sam Altman-led OpenAI, accusing it of stealing its trade secrets.

The cycle of day and night governs life on Earth, but in some regions, a remarkable phenomenon occurs where the sun never sets for weeks or even months at a time. Known as the midnight sun, this happens in latitudes above the Arctic Circle (66.56°N) and below the Antarctic Circle (66.56°S) during their respective summer seasons. During this extraordinary period, the sun remains visible even at midnight, creating endless daylight and a dreamlike atmosphere. While constant sunlight can disrupt sleep patterns, circadian rhythms, and overall biological balance, it also encourages outdoor activities, cultural festivals, social gatherings, and unique adventures. Residents and travellers alike experience a surreal, brightly sunlit environment that transforms daily life, boosts tourism, and expands recreational opportunities in fascinating ways.Norway, renowned for its dramatic fjords and Viking heritage, is a top destination to witness the midnight sun. At the North Cape, the sun remains visible for almost two months in summer. The long daylight hours allow travellers to engage in outdoor adventures like midnight golfing, hiking, and photography. Norwegian culture combines modern social systems with historic pride, and locals make the most of these endless days for festivals, barbecues, and communal activities.The midnight sun offers both an immersive natural experience and an insight into Norway’s rich cultural landscape.Alaska, often called America’s Last Frontier, covers over 663,000 square miles and is famous for its Aurora Borealis and rugged wilderness. In summer, regions such as Anchorage and northern Alaska experience prolonged daylight, allowing activities typically reserved for the day to continue late into the night. Residents often adjust sleep schedules to accommodate the extra sunlight, while visitors enjoy hiking, kayaking, and wildlife watching at unconventional hours. The midnight sun marks a transition from harsh winters to vibrant summer life, highlighting Alaska’s awe-inspiring natural beauty.Located above the Arctic Circle, Norilsk is the northernmost city of significant population, with around 180,000 residents. This mining town, rich in nickel and coal deposits, experiences the midnight sun for months. Though access is restricted for non-Russian citizens, the city offers a glimpse into human resilience in extreme conditions. Brutalist architecture dominates the landscape, prioritising functionality over aesthetics. Despite the harsh environment, the region benefits from prolonged daylight, aiding productivity and mental well-being during the sunlit summer months.Finland, a land of lakes, forests, and rich culture, enjoys months of continuous daylight in the far north. The midnight sun encourages outdoor activities, creativity, and social gatherings. Finnish culture, including its famous sauna traditions, thrives under the summer sun, while the abundance of light has influenced cuisine and lifestyle. Historically, Finland has been settled for over 13,000 years, and its northerly residents are adept at making the most of the long days, blending productivity with cultural and recreational pursuits.Northern Sweden, part of the Land of the Midnight Sun, experiences nearly continuous daylight in summer. This country is celebrated for its Renaissance architecture, expansive lakes, and peaceful way of life. Locals use the extra light to engage in outdoor sports, festivals, and cultural events. The extended sunlight has social and psychological benefits, encouraging a sense of community and active living. With only 13% of the population living in the frozen north, visitors can explore serene landscapes under the extraordinary summer sunlight.Iceland, situated just south of the Arctic Circle, experiences the midnight sun predominantly in June. Known for volcanoes, geysers, waterfalls, and glaciers, Iceland’s natural beauty is amplified by continuous daylight. Seljalandsfoss waterfall, photographed at 1 am, is a prime example of how the sun transforms familiar landscapes into magical scenes. Icelanders celebrate this phenomenon with outdoor festivals, midnight swims, and cultural events, embracing the unique energy and vibrancy it brings to daily life.Greenland, an island mostly covered by ice, enjoys continuous summer sunlight along its coastal regions. Nuuk, the capital, and surrounding towns celebrate the midnight sun with outdoor activities, fishing, and skiing. Despite extreme environmental conditions, locals adapt their routines to make the most of extended daylight. Historically, settlers named it “Greenland” to encourage immigration, yet today, the sunlit summer months offer relaxation, recreation, and a rare opportunity to witness one of Earth’s most extreme natural phenomena.In Canada’s Nunavut, Yukon, and Northwest Territories, the summer sun barely sets. Indigenous Inuit communities have lived with these extreme day-night cycles for centuries, developing lifestyles and traditions attuned to prolonged daylight. Visitors experience almost 24 hours of sunlight, perfect for hiking, wildlife watching, and cultural exploration. The midnight sun not only illuminates Canada’s rugged Arctic landscapes but also provides insight into indigenous adaptations and sustainable living in extreme northern conditions.Although mostly uninhabited, Antarctica experiences the midnight sun during its summer months (November to January). Research stations, seals, penguins, and other wildlife endure continuous daylight. Scientists take advantage of prolonged sun exposure to conduct fieldwork, while the landscape showcases towering ice shelves, glaciers, and pristine expanses. Unlike the northern hemisphere, the southern polar day occurs during the northern winter, offering a fascinating contrast in Earth’s seasonal cycles.","In some regions, the sun never sets for weeks or even months at a time.

New Visa Rules for Umrah 2025: Saudi Arabia makes hotel and transport pre-booking mandatory for visa approval,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/new-visa-rules-for-umrah-2025-saudi-arabia-makes-hotel-and-transport-pre-booking-mandatory-forvisaapproval/articleshow/124195721.cms,"Saudi tightens Umrah visa rules, Pilgrims must pre-book hotels and transport

Saudi Arabia’s new Umrah visa rules 2025 explained



Step-by-step process to apply for an Umrah visa in 2025



Book accommodation with licensed hotels or through a registered operator. Use the Nusuk Umrah/Nusuk Masar portal or an accredited travel agency to make a verified reservation; casual or unverified bookings risk visa delays or rejection.

Arrange in-country transport (if required) and obtain confirmation. Many operators now include airport transfers and local transport in Umrah packages; keep receipts and booking references ready for the visa application.

Apply for the Umrah visa via the Nusuk portal or authorized channels. The Nusuk platform consolidates visa application, accommodation verification and permit scheduling; applicants should follow its instructions to avoid third-party bottlenecks.

Work with a vetted and trusted operator if you prefer comprehensive package support. UAE-based tour operators are strongly advising pilgrims to book full packages (hotel + transport + expert guidance) to streamline approvals and ensure reliable on-ground services.

Essential travel tips for pilgrims visiting Makkah and Madinah

What to watch next





Saudi authorities now require Umrah pilgrims to have confirmed hotel bookings and arranged transport when applying for visas, a rule intended to better manage pilgrim movement and prevent fraudulent accommodation offers. Umrah operators in the UAE are already urging travelers to complete these bookings preferably through Saudi’s official Nusuk platform or licensed agents before submitting visa applications.From this year, the Saudi Ministry of Hajj and Umrah and related authorities have tightened entry rules so that visa approval depends on proof of approved accommodation, typically hotel contracts verified through the Nusuk Masar / Nusuk Umrah platform and evidence of local transport arrangements. The move is part of a wider push to digitize and centralize Umrah services, requiring pilgrims to upload or link verified bookings before a visa is issued. Authorities say the change protects pilgrims from scams and improves crowd and accommodation management during busy periods.Expect slightly higher upfront planning costs because verified hotel and transport bookings must be made before visa issuance. Prices vary by season and hotel class; booking early often secures better rates and availability.If you’re flexible, choose off-peak slots and confirm cancellations/refund policies only verified, licensed contracts processed through Nusuk or accredited agents will reliably support visa approval. Operators also recommend allowing extra processing time during peak Islamic calendar dates.The rule tightens quality control and reduces fraud, but it also shifts pre-travel planning responsibility onto pilgrims and travel agents. For Saudi regulators, the change supports Vision 2030 goals to professionalize religious tourism and improve pilgrims’ safety and experience. For travelers, the key takeaway is simple: don’t apply for an Umrah visa without verified hotel and transport bookings, do it early and use Nusuk or licensed operators to avoid hiccups.",Saudi authorities now require Umrah pilgrims to have confirmed hotel bookings and arranged transport when applying for visas.

"3 Supermoons and Meteor showers to light up UAE skies: When, where and how to watch",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/3-supermoons-and-meteor-showers-to-light-up-uae-skies-when-where-and-how-to-watch/articleshow/124194168.cms,"From October to December 2025, UAE skies will host three rare supermoons and multiple meteor showers, a celestial show you won’t want to miss.

When to watch: Supermoon and meteor-shower dates for the UAE



Hunter’s Supermoon — October 7, 2025. A bright full moon that will dominate the night sky.

Orionids meteor shower — peaks October 21–22, 2025. Best seen after midnight; this shower produces fast, bright meteors from Halley’s Comet debris.

— peaks October 21–22, 2025. Best seen after midnight; this shower produces fast, bright meteors from Halley’s Comet debris. Beaver / Southern Taurids period & Supermoon — early November (Southern Taurids peak Nov 4–5) and Beaver Supermoon — November 5, 2025. Taurids are slower and produce occasional bright fireballs; the supermoon on Nov 5 will make faint meteors harder to see.

Leonids meteor shower — peaks November 17–18, 2025. Known for quick, bright streaks; best pre-dawn viewing.

Cold Supermoon — December 4, 2025. The last of the three consecutive supermoons.

Geminids meteor shower — peaks December 13–14, 2025. One of the year’s strongest showers (under perfect dark-sky conditions it can produce very high hourly rates and vivid colored trails).

Where to watch: Best UAE stargazing spots and local viewing tips





How to watch and photograph: simple viewing and camera tips that work



Why it matters: a chance for science, community and striking photos

Quick wrap — what to pack and final checklist





The last three months of 2025 promise a rich sky show over the UAE: a run of three supermoons in October, November and December will be joined by major meteor showers - the Orionids, Leonids and Geminids giving skywatchers many clear nights to look up. Below is a compact, practical guide: exact dates, the best UAE spots to watch from, and simple photography and viewing tips so you don’t miss the action.At-a-glance calendar (local dates):(Notes: the term “supermoon” describes a full moon near its closest orbital approach; meteor-shower peaks are typically given as the nights when the highest activity is expected.For clear, memorable views head away from city lights. Popular UAE choices include the Al Qudra Desert, the Liwa dunes, the Hajar foothills and high vantage points such as Jebel Jais locations that give darker horizons and broader sky views than the city. Plan to arrive before dusk, scout a flat, safe spot, and bring warm layers for desert or mountain nights. Local guides and astronomy clubs often organize group viewings around major events, which is a good option if you prefer structured outings.Practical tip: supermoons are bright; they wash out faint meteors, so schedule meteor-watching for nights near new moons when possible (for example, the Orionids’ peak in late October benefits from darker skies).When a supermoon and a meteor peak coincide, expect fewer visible meteors.You don’t need equipment to enjoy the show, lie back, let your eyes dark-adapt for about 20–30 minutes, and scan the whole sky (meteors can appear anywhere). If you want to photograph meteors, use a tripod, shoot in manual mode with a wide-angle lens, open aperture (ideally f/2.8 or the widest your lens allows), a shutter of 10–30 seconds (use the 500/600 rule to avoid star trails) and an ISO in the 1600–3200 range; shoot many consecutive exposures rather than relying on a single long frame. These settings are a good starting point tweak for your camera and conditions. Bring a red torch to preserve night vision and shoot RAW for easier post-processing.If the moon is exceptionally bright (supermoon nights), plan your photography carefully around the moonset or move your focus entirely to detailed lunar photography. The large, glowing moon disk itself makes excellent, dramatic landscape portraits when framed with sweeping dunes or rugged mountain silhouettes.These back-to-back events are not just pretty nights; they are chances to connect with amateur astronomers, gather simple citizen-science observations (report fireballs to regional networks), and capture rare photos. The Geminids in mid-December are a highlight for photographers and families alike; the Orionids and Leonids offer quick, bright streaks that reward patience. In the UAE, where organized skywatching is growing, these events help build a community of observers and bring public attention to light-pollution and dark-sky conservationBring water, blankets or reclining chairs, a warm jacket, a red flashlight, a camera on a tripod (if shooting), and patience. Check local weather and moonrise/moonset times the day before, and follow astronomy-club updates for guided viewings. Clear sky nights in October–December 2025 will reward anyone who makes the short trip out of town.","The last three months of 2025 promise a rich sky show over the UAE.

UAE rolls out AI Platforms to boost Emirati employment and skills; What you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-rolls-out-ai-platforms-to-boost-emirati-employment-and-skills-what-youneedtoknow/articleshow/124180514.cms,"UAE’s new AI Platforms aim to transform Emirati job market and close skills gaps

Massar Al Ghurair explained - AI job-matching, skills mapping and the partners behind it



Emirati Smart Human Resource Platform: A government pilot to streamline hiring and transparency

How the AI works and what that means for jobseekers

Policy, privacy and real-world outcomes

Faster matches, clearer training paths, and a test of governance





The UAE has recently introduced AI-driven platforms aimed at accelerating Emiratization and connecting Emirati jobseekers with training and work opportunities. Two headline moves are the Massar Al Ghurair platform (an AI job-matching and upskilling service launched by the Abdulla Al Ghurair Foundation) and the Emirati Smart Human Resource Platform (a pilot rolled out by the Emirati Human Resources Development Council). Together they use labour-market intelligence, personalized skill-profiles and employer dashboards to make hiring, training and candidate discovery faster and more targeted.Massar Al Ghurair is an AI-powered skills and career platform built to help young nationals discover career paths, identify skills gaps and receive tailored upskilling recommendations plus direct job matches with participating employers. It was publicly launched earlier in 2025 with a live demo at Expo City Dubai. The platform was developed with SkyHive (now part of Cornerstone) and lists partners that include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Strategy& Middle East and Inception (a G42 company). These partnerships supply the cloud, analytics and AI tooling behind the personalized recommendations.Public reporting on the program states it aims to support tens of thousands of learners and connect them with dozens of employers and training providers; figures cited during coverage include targets such as 45,000 learners, 50 employers and 20 training partners in the initial rollouts.Launched as a pilot in late September 2025, the Emirati Smart Human Resource Platform is designed to be an integrated recruitment and skills ecosystem for Emiratis: automated job recommendations, virtual interviews, interactive employer dashboards and real-time reporting on recruitment performance. The platform emphasizes transparency and governance in hiring and is intended to increase Emirati participation across strategic sectors. Unlike a single NGO or private platform, this government-backed tool aims to give regulators and employers a live view of candidate pipelines, responsiveness and sectoral gaps making it easier to coordinate training, quotas and incentives that support national workforce goals (including alignment with long-term strategies such as the UAE Centennial and national economic agendas).Both platforms share the same practical idea: turn raw CVs and course certificates into structured skill-profiles, then use labour-market data and AI to map those profiles to jobs and to recommended training. Practically this means a jobseeker can sign up, get a dynamic “skill passport,” see exactly which short courses or micro-credentials close a gap, and be surfaced to employers whose hiring criteria match their updated profile. Employers get dashboards showing candidate fit, time-to-hire and recruitment responsiveness useful for meeting Emiratisation targets.Quicker job discovery, personalized learning roadmaps, on-the-spot virtual interviews at job fairs, and clearer visibility on which skills local employers actually want. For employers, AI trims the search time and reduces mismatch by flagging candidates with the closest skill fit. Events such as Ru’ya Careers 2025 have already used advanced recruitment tools and on-site tech to connect Emiratis with thousands of roles, illustrating how these platforms will plug into existing hiring channels.If the platforms scale as planned they could materially speed up Emiratization by making training investments more targeted, reducing job-skills mismatch and helping small and large employers find suitable national candidates quickly. The combined NGO, private-sector and government approach also helps create a shared data backbone for workforce planning. AI recommendations are only as good as the data and assumptions behind them. Policymakers and platform teams will need to guard against biased matching, protect candidate data privacy, and ensure that automated shortlists don’t entrench new forms of exclusion. Coverage of related federal HR AI work shows the UAE is already moving fast on AI-driven HR tools but governance and transparency will determine public trust.The UAE’s new AI platforms are a pragmatic response to a well-known challenge: a fast-changing job market with new skills demanded each year. Massar Al Ghurair and the Emirati Smart Human Resource Platform together offer personalized guidance, employer connections and a data-driven way to scale Emiratization but their success will depend on how well they protect candidate data, avoid algorithmic bias, and convert AI leads into actual jobs and long-term career growth.","UAE has introduced AI-driven platforms aimed at accelerating Emiratization and connecting Emirati jobseekers with training and work opportunities.

UAE: Abu Dhabi builds world’s first net-zero energy mosque using solar and mud,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-abu-dhabi-builds-worlds-first-net-zero-energy-mosque-using-solar-and-mud/articleshow/124180079.cms,"The mosque in Abu Dhabi’s Masdar City will generate 100% of its energy onsite using solar panels and passive cooling/ Image: Arup

Design solutions around faith based constraints





“Often we would want to optimize orientation to minimize the impact of the solar system and heat gain.”

“The entire western facade which is the one that experiences the highest number of solar gains is actually double fortified.”

Local materials and low-carbon innovations





A broader shift in Mosque architecture





A new milestone in sustainable architecture is underway in the UAE, where Masdar City, a sustainable urban development around 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) from downtown Abu Dhabi, is constructing the world’s first mosque designed to operate on net-zero energy. Set for completion in October, the project integrates advanced sustainability technologies with heritage-inspired design, redefining how sacred spaces are built.Masdar City, globally known for its sustainable urban planning, has commenced construction on what will become the world’s first net-zero energy mosque—a religious structure that will produce as much energy as it consumes annually. This project marks the second mosque to be built in the city, following the Estidama Mosque, which was completed in 2023 and earned LEED Platinum certification for its use of solar panels, greywater recycling, and a sunken courtyard for passive temperature regulation.The new mosque spans a circular footprint of 1,595 square meters and is designed to accommodate more than 1,300 worshippers. The structure’s compact geometry helps reduce both thermal load and internal water usage. Smart sensors embedded in the building will monitor occupancy, temperature, and humidity, allowing fans and air conditioning systems to be activated only when necessary, significantly cutting energy and water consumption.A key goal of the project is to meet LEED Zero Carbon certification standards. Developed by Aldar and designed by Arup, the mosque will be powered entirely by on-site solar panels and include an array of passive design strategies that together are expected to reduce energy use by 35% and water consumption by 55% compared to conventional benchmarks.A unique challenge in designing the mosque was ensuring that the qibla wall—which must face Mecca as required by Islamic law—did not compromise the building’s energy efficiency. Unlike other structures that can be oriented for optimal solar performance, the mosque’s fixed directional alignment required innovative solutions.Paul Simmonite, Associate Director at Arup, explained:To address this limitation, the design team implemented strategies including angled windows, canopies, and high-performance wall insulation. One major intervention was the reinforcement of the western façade, which receives the most solar exposure. As Amna Al Zaabi, Senior Analyst on Masdar City’s design management team, noted:Passive cooling systems are central to the design. The interior spaces—including prayer halls, ablution areas, and circulation zones—have been carefully shaped to capture and direct soft breezes, reducing reliance on mechanical systems. A tiered rooftop window system aids natural ventilation while enhancing daylight access, further decreasing energy demands.In homage to the region’s architectural history, the mosque’s design draws direct inspiration from the Al Bidyah Mosque, the UAE’s oldest standing mosque built in the 15th century. This influence is reflected in the use of rammed earth walls, a rare technique in modern public buildings but historically significant in the UAE.The qibla wall, spanning 60 meters, is constructed using soil sourced from a nearby quarry. The choice of materials offers both symbolic and functional benefits: it allows the mosque to blend naturally with the desert environment while leveraging thermal mass to regulate indoor temperatures.Beyond the walls, Arup’s material strategy includes the use of low-emission concrete, sustainable prayer carpets, and energy-efficient lighting, targeting reductions in both embodied and operational emissions.The mosque also sets a regional first in material innovation through its use of hydrogen-based steel rebar, supplied in partnership with EMSTEEL. This makes it the first development in the MENA region to incorporate this low-carbon steel alternative. Initial assessments suggest this could cut structural emissions by up to 95%.The mosque reflects a broader shift in how sacred spaces are being designed in the UAE. There's a clear move toward modern, minimalist architecture that prioritizes sustainability without losing religious meaning.Despite its contemporary features, the mosque keeps core Islamic elements like the mihrab and minarets at the heart of its design.This change is also made possible by more flexible and adaptive building regulations, giving architects greater room to merge tradition with bold innovation. The result is a worship space that’s modern, highly efficient, and still deeply connected to its spiritual purpose.","The mosque in Abu Dhabi’s Masdar City will generate 100% of its energy onsite using solar panels and passive cooling.

UAE market: pricing, trims and availability





Why it matters - buyer takeaways and the competition angle

Who should buy the 2025 Sportage?







The 2025 Kia Sportage arrives as a tech-forward compact SUV with a refined 2.5-litre petrol engine, a plug-in hybrid option, roomy interior comforts and a full slate of driver tech and it’s already available in the UAE with competitive pricing across trims. If you’re shopping the segment (CR-V, Tucson, RAV4), the Sportage now balances everyday usability with a proper PHEV option and strong in-car gadgetry.Kia’s petrol Sportage uses a 2.5-litre four-cylinder that produces 187 hp and 178 lb-ft of torque, paired to an 8-speed automatic and offered in FWD or AWD setups, a reliable, predictable package for daily driving and highway cruising. For buyers seeking efficiency and short electric runs, Kia offers a plug-in hybrid (PHEV) variant that combines a 1.6-litre turbo engine with a 13 kWh battery for a combined output around 261 hp and an EPA-estimated all-electric range near 34 miles on the PHEV model. That PHEV powertrain gives the Sportage sharper acceleration and a meaningful zero-emissions commute for shorter trips.The Sportage is widely available across UAE dealers and online listings, with pricing that varies by engine, drivetrain and trim. Local market guides and dealers show a broad band for the 2025 Sportage roughly AED 103,000 to AED 149,000 depending on trim and drivetrain, while average online listings put the market price near AED 114,000 for commonly offered configurations.Dealers in Dubai and other emirates already list new and used 2025 Sportage units, so test drives and immediate delivery options are common for popular trims. If you prefer the PHEV, expect a premium over the petrol model but get the benefit of short all-electric trips and stronger combined performance.The Sportage’s strengths are clear: a well-measured petrol engine for everyday use, a competitive PHEV that answers buyers’ efficiency needs, roomy second-row comfort, and a tech stack that lifts its perceived value. Against rivals — Honda CR-V, Hyundai Tucson and Toyota RAV4 the Sportage competes strongly on features and offers a more compelling electrified option for urban commuters. Production and supply moves (Kia is expanding hybrid production capacity globally) suggest continued availability of hybrid variants in coming years, which matters for buyers planning ownership and resale.If you want a compact SUV with modern cabin tech, generous rear passenger space and the option to cut short-trip emissions with a PHEV, the 2025 Sportage should be on your shortlist. Choose the petrol 2.5L for a straightforward, economical daily driver; pick the PHEV if you value electric-only city range and stronger combined performance. As always, take a test drive to compare ride feel across trims and confirm dealer specifications and warranty packages in the UAE.","The 2025 Kia Sportage arrives as a tech-forward compact SUV with a refined 2.5-litre petrol engine, a plug-in hybrid option, roomy interior comforts and a full slate of driver tech.

About Dubai police Anti-Fraud Department







The Anti-Fraud Department at the General Department of Criminal Investigation in Dubai Police have issued an urgent warning about a new and growing online scam spreading through search engines and social media. Fraudsters are creating fake websites that impersonate official “Consumer Protection” platforms. By tricking victims into visiting these sites, scammers gain access to mobile data via malicious “remote access” applications, enabling them to carry out unauthorized financial transactions.Dubai Police explained that when a victim searches for a consumer protection platform to file a complaint, they may be misled into entering their personal details – such as name, email, phone number, and complaint description – on one of these fraudulent websites. The scammer then contacts the victim directly, posing as an official employee, and repeats the details of the complaint to appear credible.Once trust is established, the fraudster instructs the victim to download remote control software and simultaneously log in to their bank account. This allows the scammer to view the victim’s phone screen in real time, steal sensitive banking information, and carry out illegal transfers or purchases.Dubai Police stressed that these malicious applications are specifically designed to mirror the content of the victim’s device, granting full control to the fraudster. This exposes confidential data and enables its unlawful use.The force urged the public to only use official consumer protection channels, avoid downloading suspicious applications, and never share banking information with unauthorised parties.Dubai Police further urged immediate reporting of such attempts through the eCrime platform or by calling 901, to safeguard personal data and finances.The Anti-Fraud Department of Dubai Police was formally established as part of the General Department of Criminal Investigation to specifically combat financial crimes and scams. Over the past decade, it has grown into a sophisticated unit employing advanced forensic and digital technologies to track, investigate, and dismantle complex fraud networks, including cyber-enabled financial fraud, identity theft, and money laundering. This department uses biometric tools, data recovery, and international cooperation to tackle crimes, often involving high-value thefts such as gold and credit card scams.It also addresses emerging threats like AI-assisted fraud and fake online businesses, ensuring Dubai’s financial system remains secure by rapidly uncovering fraud schemes and arresting perpetrators. The department actively raises public awareness of fraud risks and encourages reporting to protect citizens and businesses alike.","Fraudsters create fake ‘Consumer Protection’ websites, luring users into downloading malicious apps that mirror their screens and steal banking data.

No such programme has ever aired on the network.In the AI-generated segment, Lara Trump declared: “Breaking. Now, President Donald J. Trump has announced a historic new health care system. The launch of America's first med bed hospitals, and a national Med bed card for every citizen.”The video then showed Trump’s likeness promising: “Every American will soon receive their own med bed card. With it, you'll have guaranteed access to our new hospitals, led by the top doctors in the nation. Equipped with the most advanced technology in the world, these facilities are safe, modern and designed to restore every citizen to full health and strength. This is the beginning of a new era in American healthcare. ”The segment also featured Lara Trump claiming that only a limited number of “med bed cards” would be available in the first phase, with details to follow.The “medbed” conspiracy theory claims that governments and militaries are secretly hiding advanced healing technology capable of curing diseases, reversing ageing, and even regenerating limbs. The idea grew from QAnon-related groups, with some followers insisting such devices have kept John F. Kennedy Jr. alive.Believers say medbeds use futuristic tools such as ions, terahertz light waves, AI and quantum technology, while some go as far as to suggest alien origins. Proponents also argue Big Pharma and wealthy elites already possess the devices but deliberately withhold them.The New York Times and Rolling Stone have reported that companies are cashing in on the hype, selling expensive devices and “medbed cards” online that promise access to healing technology. Tesla BioHealing, a US-based company, markets devices it says provide “life force energy” but admits its products are not FDA-approved to treat illnesses. The FDA has already issued warnings over alleged regulatory violations.Experts, including disinformation analysts, have dismissed the concept as pseudoscience. As one told the BBC: “It’s really hard to define something that doesn’t exist.”","The clip was designed to look like a Fox News broadcast hosted by his daughter- in-law, Lara Trump.

Error-free UPI transactions: NPCI bans nicknames in UPI payments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/banking/error-free-upi-transactions-npci-bans-nicknames-in-upi-payments-heres-how-it-will-benefit-users/articleshow/120721570.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a significant move to enhance user safety and transparency in digital transactions, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’, as recorded in the Core Banking System (CBS), during peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-merchant (P2PM) transactions.In a circular dated April 24, 2025, the NPCI issued an addendum to its earlier guidelines, mandating UPI apps to ensure that only the bank-registered name of the recipient is shown on the transaction confirmation screen and in the transaction history.The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.According to NPCI, the ""ultimate beneficiary"" is the person or entity receiving funds for services or goods provided. Going forward, names fetched directly from the Validate Address API – the same used to retrieve official bank names, will be the only ones shown to payers. Names derived from QR codes, contact lists, or user-defined labels will no longer be permitted.“This change is being introduced to help customers verify they are sending money to the correct beneficiary and to reduce risks of misdirected payments,” NPCI stated in its communication to UPI ecosystem members.Many UPI apps currently allow users to modify payee display names or generate aliases, making it easier for fraudsters to impersonate trusted brands or individuals. Going forward, this loophole will be shut.NPCI has clearly instructed that apps must disable any feature that allows users to edit or customise beneficiary names within their interfaces.The circular comes amid growing concerns over rising UPI-based frauds, often caused by misleading display names that do not match official records. “This step can drastically reduce accidental transfers and fraudulent transactions. Displaying only the bank-verified name adds a key layer of authentication,” said Rahul Jain, CFO at NTT DATA Payment Services India according to an ET report.The change will particularly impact small merchants who fall under the P2PM category, such as kirana store owners or street vendors, who often receive payments via QR codes embedded with non-official names. Once enforced, customers will be shown only the CBS-registered name, not the store’s brand name or any custom label.“This will bring much-needed clarity for users and reduce errors. It enhances trust and makes the payment ecosystem more secure,” said Atul Gupta, head of risk & compliance at Cashfree Payments.Despite some anticipated transition challenges for users accustomed to aliases or nicknames, experts believe the change is a step in the right direction. As Mukesh Chand, senior counsel at Economic Laws Practice, explained, “It helps reduce anonymity and gives users more confidence before authorising a transaction.”By standardising the way beneficiary names are displayed, NPCI aims to make UPI payments safer, more transparent, and less prone to manipulation.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’ The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Medium-rare shift





On a weeknight in a compact Mumbai kitchen, 29-year-old Justin whisks together a quick salad while his air fryer hums with sweet potato wedges. For him, cooking is less a chore and more a ritual, a way to unwind after work, entertain friends, and explore diverse flavours.Justin represents a growing tribe. Across urban India, men are stepping into kitchens with greater frequency, armed with sleek gadgets, high-performance cookware, and a desire to take charge of what’s on their plates.The shift isn’t just cultural, it’s commercial. Sales numbers tell the story. “About 30% of our online buyers today are men, and nearly 45% of our online traffic comes from male consumers. Five to six years ago, this was just a fraction,” says Stahl Kitchens CEO Dhruv Agarwal. He notes that households now make cookware decisions jointly, with both partners more willing to invest in premium products that promise durability and convenience. At Wonderchef, the trend is equally visible.“Men represent a much larger share of our buyers compared with five or six years ago. While women still make up the majority, the gap is narrowing as men increasingly purchase appliances and cookware for themselves,” says founder and CEO Ravi Saxena.What’s driving the change? Health consciousness, flexible work patterns, and easy recipes on social media. “With hectic lifestyles and high-intensity workouts, many men want greater control over what they eat: from reducing oil and avoiding processed foods to ensuring meals are cooked in safe cookware,” Saxena says.The shopping patterns reflect two broad groups. “Young, independent cooks, often living alone, buy one or two versatile, non-toxic cookware pieces to cook from scratch,” says Ember Cookware co-founder and CEO Siddharth Gadodia. “Then there are the passionate cooks, usually busy professionals who don’t cook daily but invest in premium sets to recreate family recipes or achieve restaurant-style results.” He notes that “about 70% of men who buy cookware use it themselves at least once a week. They also tend to opt for higher-value or complete sets, and their average order value is 12% higher than others”.Industry players say what appeals most male buyers are multi-functional devices and durable tools: kitchen robots that knead, chop, stir, steam, and cook; and tri-ply stainless steel woks.","Across urban India, men are stepping into kitchens with greater frequency.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

What is Office Agent in Copilot chat





Microsoft has launched new features in its 365 Copilot, introducing Agent Mode in Office apps and Office Agent in Copilot chat. Announcing the new features, the company said the update is designed to bring “agentic productivity” to Office tools, allowing users to work with AI more interactively. With Agent Mode, available in Excel and Word, users can generate spreadsheets and documents directly within the apps by starting with a simple prompt and then refining results through iterative guidance. Support for PowerPoint will follow soon.The new Office Agent in Copilot chat, on the other hand, can create polished PowerPoint presentations and ready-to-use Word documents from a single prompt. Microsoft said Excel support will be added in the coming months. The company described the additions as the next step in human–AI collaboration, aimed at helping users complete multi-step tasks and produce higher-quality Office documents, spreadsheets and presentations more efficiently.Microsoft said Excel’s new Agent Mode is designed to make the app’s advanced features more accessible beyond expert users. While Excel already powers everything from household budgets to Fortune 500 profit and loss statements, many of its most powerful functions are difficult for non-specialists to use.Agent Mode brings AI that can “speak Excel” natively, combining the app’s data modeling tools with OpenAI’s latest reasoning models. According to Microsoft, the feature can generate outputs, check results, fix issues, and repeat the process until the outcome is verified — similar to working with an Excel expert, but with users still able to steer and guide.The company said the aim is to democratize access to expert-level Excel capabilities, making advanced data modeling approachable for a much wider audience.Microsoft also shared Agent Mode in Excel prompts to try:Agent Mode in Word is aimed to turn document writing into a more interactive and conversational process. The feature allows users to prompt Copilot with simple instructions — for example, “summarize recent customer feedback and highlight key trends.” Copilot then drafts content, suggests refinements, and asks clarifying questions, making the process feel more like a dialogue than a task.Microsoft said the tool uses Word’s native styles and formatting to produce polished documents while helping users focus on intent rather than execution. The company added that this deeper interaction enables faster iteration, improved ideas, and a more engaging writing experience.Here are some Agent Mode in Word prompts to try:Office Agent in Copilot lets users create PowerPoint presentations and Word documents directly from chat. Powered by Anthropic’s models, the tool is designed for a chat-first workflow, reflecting how much of today’s work begins in messaging interfaces.The company said Office Agent addresses a common shortcoming of AI tools over the past two years — the inability to produce effective presentation slides. With the new feature, users can generate well-structured PowerPoint decks and research-backed Word documents from a single prompt, aiming to make content creation faster and more reliable.","Microsoft has launched new features in its 365 Copilot, introducing Agent Mode in Office apps and Office Agent in Copilot chat.

How Google DeepMind’s new AI models can improve vision and reasoning in robots,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-google-deepminds-new-ai-models-can-improve-vision-and-reasoning-in-robots/articleshow/124215324.cms,"How these two new AI models will work for robots



Mark Zuckerberg unveils three new Meta AI smart glasses





Google DeepMind has recently introduced two new artificial intelligence (AI) models, Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 and Gemini Robotics 1.5. These new models are designed to enhance the capabilities of general-purpose robots significantly. The models are designed to operate in tandem, improving a robot's reasoning, vision, and ability to execute actions in real-world settings.According to a blog shared by the company, this new two-model system will split the planning and execution tasks. Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 will serve as the planner or orchestrator, determining the steps needed, while Gemini Robotics 1.5 is responsible for executing the physical functions based on natural language instructions.This separation is intended to overcome the limitations of earlier single-model systems, which often led to errors and delays when attempting to plan and perform actions simultaneously.The ER 1.5 model serves as a vision-language model (VLM) capable of advanced reasoning and integrating external tools. It can generate multi-step plans for tasks and shows strong performance on spatial understanding benchmarks. The model can also access resources, such as Google Search, to gather information and inform decision-making in physical environments.After a plan is created, Gemini Robotics 1.5, a vision-language-action (VLA) model, comes in. This model converts instructions and visual data into motor commands, allowing the robot to execute tasks. It determines the most efficient way to complete actions and can provide natural language explanations of its decisions.The system enables robots to handle complex, multi-step commands smoothly. For instance, a robot could sort items into compost, recycling, and trash bins by checking local recycling guidelines online, analysing objects, planning the sorting, and then executing the process.DeepMind notes that the AI models are adaptable to robots of various shapes and sizes due to their spatial awareness and flexible design. Currently, the ER 1.5 planner is available to developers via the Gemini API in Google AI Studio, while the VLA model is limited to select partners.This represents a step toward integrating generative AI into robotics, using natural language for control and separating planning from execution to reduce errors.","Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 will serve as the planner or orchestrator, while Gemini Robotics 1. 5 is responsible for executing the physical functions based on natural language instructions.

Kevin O’Leary warns $100K H‑1B fee threatens US and not India and other countries







Canadian millionaire and Stark Tank investor Kevin O’Leary has dismissed the idea that AI will destroy jobs. O’Leary disagrees with the idea that AI will wipe out jobs, instead he believes that artificial intelligence is a tool for productivity and higher-value opportunities. His comments come growing concerns that AI adoption is shrinking entry-level hiring across industries.O’Leary posted a video on social media platform X (previously known as Twitter) wrote, “AI isn’t destroying jobs, it’s creating better ones.” He stressed on the fact that how more than 50 of his companies are already using AI to cut costs and boost efficiency.“Even my watch insurance business issues policies in nine seconds thanks to AI. This is just the beginning,” he said.O’Leary also emphasised that AI eliminates repetitive, low-skill tasks and allow workers to learn and pursue higher-paying opportunities. If AI can flip burgers, that’s a good thing. It leaves people free to explore and educate themselves into higher levels of job creation,” he added.Drawing parallels with past technological shifts, he said: “When television came, they said radio would be dead.That never happened. It’s the same with AI.”Recently, investor and Shark Tank star Kevin O’Leary has sharply criticised US President Donald Trump’s increased H-1B visa fee hike. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Kevin argued that the iconic tech giants Apple , Google and Oracle famously began in garages might have never taken off under today’s restrictive immigration rules. “I think what this does is hurt innovation long‑term,” O’Leary wrote, adding that the U.S. should not spend resources training top foreign students at institutions like MIT and Harvard only to “kick them out.” He suggested such graduates should automatically be allowed to stay, marry, and build companies in America.","O’Leary posted a video on social media platform X (previously known as Twitter) wrote, “AI isn’t destroying jobs, it’s creating better ones” He stressed on the fact that how more than 50 of his companies are already using AI to cut costs.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124215210,imgsize-46140,width-400,resizemode-4/39shark-tank39-star-kevin-o39leary-says-financial-middlemen-will-be-left-shining-shoes-when-defi-technology-takes-their-jobs.jpg"

Sir Jony Ive couldn't find a decent lantern for his sailboat, so naturally, he designed one himself. The result is the Sailing Lantern—a 1.5kg chunk of machined stainless steel and precision-ground glass that costs $4,800 and looks like maritime jewelry.It's the first collaboration between Ive's LoveFrom collective and Tokyo-based Balmuda, limited to just 1,000 pieces. According to the Financial Times, Ive describes it as addressing extreme functional challenges: ""Most stainless steels will corrode. Only a few are marine grade.""The design draws from vintage ship lanterns, though Ive told Wallpaper* he avoided mere nostalgia. ""The reason this feels familiar isn't because we took elements that previously existed. The reason it is familiar is humanity and ingenuity,"" he explained. He's been sailing since childhood, and when you're on the water, your connection to nature demands tools that can actually survive out there.Balmuda founder Gen Terao called the engineering process formidable—a couple of very hard years getting everything to Ive's exacting standards. The lantern uses LEDs that mimic natural light, starting with a reddish glow at low settings and shifting to white-blue at full brightness, like actual flames.When you turn it off, the light slowly extinguishes rather than clicking dead.The textured polyester strap resists salt and sun. The flower-shaped dial clicks satisfyingly. The whole thing weighs enough to feel substantial, and Ive casually tossed it around during interviews to prove it's genuinely rugged, not precious.""As I've got older, who I work with has become far more important than what I work on,"" Ive told Wallpaper*. Most of these lanterns will probably never see a boat—like diving watches that spend their lives at dinner parties—but that's sort of the point.","Sir Jony Ive's LoveFrom collective and Tokyo-based Balmuda collaborated on the Sailing Lantern.

Today’s theme: [e.g., food, travel, emotions].""Daily vocabulary exercises enhance memory retention and provide contextual understanding. Using themes makes learning relevant and engaging, while pronunciation tips and example sentences help learners use words naturally in conversation.Prompt:""Act as a Native Speaker of [target language] and simulate a basic conversation with me about [situation, e.g., ordering at a café, meeting someone new]. Ask and respond as if we were talking in real life.""Simulating conversations with a native speaker helps learners build confidence in real-world situations. ChatGPT can adjust responses based on your answers, allowing learners to practice speaking and listening without fear of judgment.Prompt:""Act as a Grammar Expert and explain [specific grammar rule] in [target language] using simple examples and comparisons to English. Include a short practice exercise.""Grammar is often one of the hardest parts of learning a new language. With ChatGPT, learners receive clear explanations, examples, and exercises, making complicated rules easier to understand and apply.Prompt:""Act as a Dialogue Creator and write a natural, real-life dialogue in [target language] about [scenario, e.g., airport check-in, grocery shopping]. Add translations and highlight key phrases to remember.""By practicing real-life dialogues, learners internalize commonly used phrases. Highlighting key phrases helps them remember the vocabulary needed for day-to-day interactions, improving both comprehension and fluency.Prompt:""Act as a Listening Coach and suggest a short audio or video in [target language] suited for a beginner. Then quiz me on the content with 3–5 comprehension questions and provide the correct answers afterward.""Listening skills are essential for understanding native speakers. This prompt helps learners actively engage with audio content, reinforcing their understanding of pronunciation, sentence structure, and context.Prompt:""Act as a Language Corrector and analyse my sentence: '[Insert your sentence in target language].'

"Zomato founder Deepinder Goyal: For years, there’s been something about Zomato that made me uneasy",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/zomato-founder-deepinder-goyal-for-years-theres-been-something-about-zomato-that-made-me-uneasy/articleshow/124212377.cms,"What is Zomato’s Healthy mode

Zomato’s Healthy mode availability

For years, there’s been something about Zomato that made me uneasy.

We made eating out and ordering in easier than ever, but we never really helped people truly eat better. Yes, you could find a salad or a smoothie bowl, but the truth is, if you wanted to eat genuinely nourishing food, Zomato didn’t make it easy.

That weighed on me, because when we say our mission is “better food for more people”, the “better” has to mean something deeper.

Today, we’ve taken one of the biggest steps in fixing that blind spot. We’re launching Healthy Mode on Zomato.

Every dish in this mode now comes with a Healthy Score—from Low to Super—based on what really counts for your health: protein, complex carbs, fibre, and micronutrients, and not just calories. Behind the scenes it’s AI and restaurant data doing the heavy lifting, but what you’ll see is simple: a clear explanation of what makes a dish healthy, and why.

This is not your run of the mill “healthy mode” for beginners. We have kept the bar very high, that professional athletes can rely on healthy mode to find food that works for them.

This is personal for me. I’ve carried the guilt that Zomato made it easy to eat whatever you craved, but not easy to eat what your body needed. Healthy Mode is our first real step in putting that right.

It’s live in Gurgaon, and we’ll expand fast. Try it, tear it apart, tell us where it fails. Because this is just the beginning—and for the first time, I feel we’re moving meaningfully closer to truly living up to our mission: better food for more people.





Deepinder Goyal recently shared one thing that had bothered him for years — Zomato made eating out and ordering in easier, but did not help people “truly eat better.” Sharing his thoughts in a post on X (formerly Twitter), Zomato founder Deepinder Goyal wrote: “For years, there’s been something about Zomato that made me uneasy.

The score is based on nutrients such as protein, complex carbohydrates, fibre and micronutrients, rather than just calories.Goyal said the scores are powered by AI and restaurant data, but explained in a simple way for users to understand why a dish qualifies as healthy. He added that the company has set a high bar for this feature, aiming to make it reliable even for professional athletes seeking balanced meals.Calling the move “personal,” Goyal admitted he felt Zomato had long made it easy to satisfy cravings but not easy to find food the body truly needed. “Healthy Mode is our first real step in putting that right,” he said.Deepinder Goyal revealed that Zomato’s Healthy mode is currently live in Gurgaon with the company planning to expand it in more cities in the coming future.Here’s the full post as shared by Zomato founder Deepinder Goyal","Zomato has launched a new feature called the Healthy mode.

Check upgrade eligibility easily. Users can verify Windows 11 compatibility by navigating to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update , or by using Microsoft's PC Health Check app. Extended Security Updates (ESU) offer a bridge. Microsoft is providing one-year ESU coverage from October 15, 2025, to October 13, 2026, giving users time to plan their transition. Commercial pricing starts at $61 per device. Organisations can subscribe to ESU for $61 per device annually, renewable for up to three years with increasing costs each year. Enrollment is available now through Microsoft Volume Licensing . Cloud users get free ESU coverage. Windows 10 devices accessing Windows 11 through Windows 365 Cloud PCs or Virtual Machines automatically receive ESU at no additional cost. Microsoft promises significant improvements with Windows 11. The newer operating system offers 62% fewer security incidents, up to 2.3x faster performance, and 50% faster workflows compared to Windows 10.

Microsoft will officially end support for Windows 10 on October 14, 2025, marking the conclusion of a nearly decade-long run for the operating system that launched in July 2015. After this date, the 1.4 billion Windows devices worldwide will no longer receive security updates, feature improvements, or technical support—leaving users vulnerable to cybersecurity threats unless they take action.The transition affects both individual users and organizations running Windows 10. While devices will continue to function after the deadline, the absence of regular security patches exposes them to malware, viruses, and other cyber threats. Companies may also struggle to maintain regulatory compliance with unsupported software, and some applications could experience decreased functionality.","Microsoft will officially end support for Windows 10 on October 14, 2025.
