What the Kardashians said about Lauren Sanchez’s Blue Origin space flight



“This is a really unique experience and we’re just so honored to be here to support them and watch this amazing part of history, and I’m so proud of her,”

How Sanchez solved NASA's 'uniform problem' before her Blue Origin flight



Amazon founder Jeff Bezos ' fiancée, Lauren Sánchez, received a space-themed gift from Kris Jenner, Kim Kardashian, and Khloé Kardashian after her recent Blue Origin Space flight. The Kardashians gave Sanchez a Judith Leiber handbag shaped like an UFO, valued at $6,995. The UFO Orbiter bag features star-shaped and geometric crystals, aligning with the theme of the Blue Orgin's Space flight. Sánchez shared the gift on her Instagram story (seen by Page Six), describing it as “Out of this world!” and tagged the three Kardashian sisters. The gift came shortly after this week’s all-women space flight, which Sánchez helped organise alongside Bezos through his Blue Origin initiative.Kris Jenner and Khloé Kardashian traveled to Van Horn, Texas, earlier this week to support Lauren Sánchez as she took part in an all-female Blue Origin space flight.Jenner said about Sánchez.Khloé Kardashian also shared her thoughts, saying the family is proud of “all of the female astronauts,” referring to the rest of the crew, which included: Katy Perry, Gayle King, Aisha Bowe, Amanda Nguyen and Kerianne Flynn.Ahead of her Blue Origin flight, Sánchez emphasized the importance of designing better-fitting spacesuits for women. Collaborating with designers Fernando Garcia and Laura Kim, Sánchez helped develop a suit specifically designed for women, addressing a long-standing issue where space suits were originally made for men and later adapted.Her efforts align with Blue Origin’s focus on inclusive design and follow a 2019 incident where NASA cancelled an all-female spacewalk due to a lack of properly fitting suits.","Kris Jenner, Kim Kardashian, and Khloé Kardashian gave Lauren Sánchez a $6,995 handbag shaped like an UFO.

TOI Correspondent from London:

Over the years, patrons of Britain’s oldest Indian restaurant, ‘Veeraswamy’, have included Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Charlie Chaplin, Winston Churchill, Marlon Brando, Sharon Stone and David Cameron.A haunt of Indian maharajas and European royalty too, the King of Denmark even shipped out a cask of Carlsberg for staff to store for whenever he dined there.Now the Michelin-starred restaurant , which opened in 1926 on Regent Street, London, and today serves pineapple curry and chicken makhana au vin, is at threat of closure as the Crown Estate (property portfolio owned by King Charles), which owns Victory House, the building in which the restaurant is based, is refusing to renew its lease, which expires in June.The Crown Estate claims it needs to take the restaurant space back to extend the ground floor reception for offices on the building’s upper floors. Knocking through into Veeraswamy would give it an extra 11 sq mts.Veeraswamy’s founder, Edward Palmer, was the great-grandson of General William Palmer, and his wife, Begum Faiz Baksh, a Mughal princess. Gen Palmer was private secretary to Warren Hastings, first governor-general of the Presidency of Fort William. It was acquired by Ranjit Mathrani and Namita Panjabi in 1996.“Had they wanted to, they could’ve easily put the office reception on the first floor. I think they’ve come to the view that it’s too tiresome having a restaurant there, they want it to be all offices,” Mathrani (81), told the Times of London.If the Crown Estate refuses to allow the restaurant to stay put until he finds and fit out an alternative space, with its iconic décor inspired by the art nouveau of the 1920s and maharaja’s palaces, the restaurant will have to close, leading to possible redundancies and loss of business until a new site is found.Mathrani is taking the Crown Estate to court.A spokesperson for The Crown Estate told TOI: “The Crown Estate has a duty to generate value for the nation, while acting as responsible stewards for this historic part of London. We need to carry out a comprehensive refurbishment of Victory House. This includes a major upgrade to the offices and improving the entrance to make it more accessible. Due to the limited options available in this listed building we need to remove the entrance to the restaurant, which means we will not be able to offer Veeraswamy an extension when their lease expires.”","Michelin-starred restaurant Veeraswamy opened in 1926 on Regent Street, London.

Poll Should archaeological sites be preserved for historical and religious significance? Only if funds are available Absolutely, they are vital

Archaeologists working at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem have uncovered evidence of an ancient garden, aligning with biblical accounts . The excavation has revealed seeds and pollen from olive trees and grapevines, potentially dating back around 2,000 years.The discovery supports a passage in the New Testament, John 19:41, which states, ""Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid.""Francesca Stasolla , an archaeology professor at the Sapienza University of Rome, confirmed the findings and emphasized their significance in an interview with Fox News Digital. She explained that the organic material was discovered in layers from a time when the site transitioned from a quarry to a funerary location.""The quarry had to be gradually abandoned and as the stone extraction ended it was used for agricultural areas and tombs,"" Stasolla said. ""This must have been what it looked like in the 1st century AD""Excavations at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre mark the first major restoration project at the revered Christian site in nearly two centuries. The work is taking place in areas shared by different religious communities .The site itself has a long and complex history. Originally built in 326 AD, the church was destroyed in 1009 AD under the orders of Islamic ruler al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah. It was later reconstructed by Christian Crusaders in the 12th century.""The current church is that of the Crusader reconstruction, but the whole church is a composition of historical phases from the fourth century to the modern age,"" Stasolla explained.The area’s religious and historical importance is evident in the many artifacts found during the excavation. Objects dating as far back as the Iron Age, including ceramics, metal, and glass, offer evidence of the site's long history as a place of worship.""Ceramics, metals, glass… [all] document both the occupation of the area and the presence of believers and pilgrims,"" Stasolla noted, adding that the goal of the excavation is to deepen understanding of the region’s religious significance.When asked whether the recent findings reinforce the biblical reference to a garden at the site of Christ’s crucifixion, Stasolla acknowledged the connection while clarifying the role of archaeology.""Archaeology provides us with data that must then be historicized and interpreted,"" she said. ""In this case, it documents an agricultural use of the quarry… [the Bible quote] is certainly suggestive [of this].""The excavation remains ongoing, and according to Stasolla, more discoveries are expected. ""It is certainly a strategic excavation for the knowledge of the development of the city and its process of sacralization in a Christian key,"" she said.","Archaeologists working at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem have uncovered evidence of an ancient garden.

Europeans Need Permit To Enter Uk, Trumps Reciprocal Tariffs Begin April 2

UK has introduced a new online entry requirements for European visitors from Wednesday, implementing a digital Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) permit as part of enhanced security measures.European travellers must obtain an ETA permit, initially priced at £10 (12 euros), with costs increasing to £16 from April 9. The system has already been operational for visitors from America, Canada and other visa-exempt nations since Britain's EU departure in 2020.UK border force chief Phil Douglas confirmed this implementation as part of a broader global rollout, emphasising its primary function as a security measure.The system aims to expedite entry procedures whilst enabling background checks on immigration history and criminal records. Douglas highlighted that approved travellers would benefit from faster border crossing through eGates.""The quid pro quo for the individual, though, is that we are building a contactless border, so if they're cleared for entry, they'll be able to use our new eGates and they'll be able to go through the border much more quickly,"" he added.During the initial buffer period, expected to continue until ""September or October,"" travellers can still proceed with their journeys. The ETA remains valid for two years, permitting stays up to six months.Applications opened to Europeans in March, covering approximately 30 countries, excluding Ireland. Applicants must submit passport photos and facial images through a smartphone app or government website, typically taking 10 minutes to complete.Whilst most applications receive swift responses, authorities advise allowing three working days. The requirement extends to all ages, though transit passengers not crossing UK borders are exempt following Heathrow Airport's concerns about European connection traffic.Heathrow, which handled 84 million passengers in 2024 with one-third from the EU, initially launched the scheme for Qatar in 2023 before expanding to Gulf nations. By January, it included about 50 additional countries including Argentina, South Korea and New Zealand.","European travellers must obtain an ETA permit, initially priced at £10 (12 euros), with costs increasing to £16 from April 9.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

ChatGPT randomly address users by names

OpenAI’s silence and user reactions



Some ChatGPT users have noticed an unsettling change—the AI chatbot is referring to them by name unprompted, even when they haven’t shared their names. As reported by TechCrunch, the unexpected personalisation has sparked mixed reactions, with some calling it “creepy and unnecessary.”Several users on X (formerly Twitter) have reported that ChatGPT randomly addresses them by name, despite never inputting personal details. Software developer Simon Willison described the behaviour as “weird and invasive,” while another user, Nick Dobos, said he “hated it.”The change appears to coincide with OpenAI’s upgraded memory feature, which allows ChatGPT to retain details from past conversations. However, some users claim the chatbot mentions their names even when memory settings are disabled, raising concerns about data privacy and AI transparency.OpenAI has not yet responded to inquiries about the issue, leaving users speculating whether the name usage is intentional or a glitch. The controversy highlights the fine line between personalisation and discomfort, with some users comparing the experience to a teacher repeatedly calling their name in class.Experts suggest that AI-driven name recognition can feel forced and unnatural, making interactions less authentic rather than more engaging.","ChatGPT randomly addresses users by name, despite never inputting personal details.

"Netflix called 'Woke Trash', Elon Musk replies",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/netflix-called-woke-trash-elon-musk-replies/articleshow/120409964.cms,"Elon Musk against wokeness

Supporters use “woke” to describe people who are socially conscious and trying to make the world fairer.

Critics often use “wokeism” negatively, saying it means being too politically correct, overly sensitive, or pushing social ideas too far.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently replied to an X post calling out Netflix for its woke content. An X user recently named Gunther Eagleman @GuntherEagleman wrote on X: “Netflix is woke trash.” The post caught Musk’s attention who responded to it in agreement, saying “True”. Elon Musk’s reply to Gunther Eagleman’s post reflects his critique of Netflix. Earlier this month, the tech CEO slammed the streaming platform for its latest web series Adolescence, alleging an “anti-white propaganda”.As mentioned above, this is notably not the first time when the tech billionaire has criticised Netflix for its content. In the year 2022, Musk said that “The woke mind virus is making Netflix unwatchable."" He was responding to a post by Slashdot, referring to a subscriber loss of the streaming platform then.Musk, in reply to a user then, also said that he hopes the streaming giant would make more science fiction movies. “Can they please just make sci-fi/fantasy at least *mostly* about sci-fi/fantasy?” he tweeted.Musk has been a critique of wokeness calling it “divisive, exclusionary and hateful” in the past. He told The Babylon Bee that “woke mind virus” is “a world without humor”, stating that wokeness is the greatest threat to modern civilisation. “At its heart, wokeness is divisive, exclusionary and hateful. It basically gives mean people a shield to be cruel, armored in false virtue,"" Musk said.In an interview last year, Musk said that the woke mind virus killed his son, referring to his son Xavier, now known as Vivian Jenna Wilson. He then shared his concern about using puberty blockers in children and said he felt he was “tricked” into agreeing to his son’s sex change.For those wondering, Wokeism refers to a set of beliefs or attitudes that emphasize being socially aware, especially about issues like racism, gender identity, inequality, and injustice. The term comes from the word “woke,” which originally meant being alert to social problems, especially those affecting marginalized groups.

How Nico Mueller secured the top spot

Andretti driver Nico Mueller and his race engineer Bertrand Mermine have surged to the top of the ABB Engineered to Outrun leaderboard following a dramatic Miami Grand Prix, where post-race penalties reshuffled the final standings in Mueller’s favour. Though he originally crossed the line in 10th, Mueller was promoted to 4th, thanks to a well-timed strategy and a dash of late-race chaos. His calculated decision to split Attack Mode usage proved decisive, paying off when several drivers were hit with time penalties after the chequered flag.The Engineered to Outrun leaderboard celebrates the most dynamic driver-engineer duos in Formula E—tracking those who gain the most positions during a race, with emphasis on overtaking prowess, energy management, and overall race pace. The season concludes with an award for the top-ranked pairing.After Round 5 in Miami, the leaderboard has Maserati MSG Racing’s Stoffel Vandoorne and his race engineer Thibault Arnal on number 2. Mahindra Racing’s Nyck De Vries and race engineer Tom Bayles are in third position in the ABB Engineered to Outrun leaderboard.The FIA Formula E Instagram account also shared the update, posting:“@nico.mueller51 overtaking his way up the rankings! With a mega drive from P18 to P4, the @andrettife driver tops the @abbgroup Engineered to Outrun leaderboard after Round 5. #MiamiEPrix #FormulaE #Motorsport #Racing.”Nico Mueller’s rise was the result of strategy combined with fortunate timing. While many drivers delayed activating Attack Mode until later in the race, Mueller opted for a more aggressive strategy—using two four-minute activations, starting with the first on Lap 11 to position himself within points range.By Lap 20, Mueller was running in 10th when a red flag was brought out following a three-car collision. After the restart, as the majority of the grid scrambled to use their remaining Attack Mode activations, Mueller’s earlier strategy gave him an edge.Despite finishing 10th on the road, he was ultimately classified 4th after multiple post-race penalties were issued.

Travis Kelce downplays Ken doll idea while fans imagine Barbie dream life with Taylor Swift

Donovan Mitchell on Cavs #1 Seed, Career “MJ Moment,” Attending LeBron’s ""Decision"" & More | EP 135

Travis Kelce found himself at the center of an unexpected pop culture moment after joking about becoming a Ken doll on the “New Heights” podcast. While he laughed off the idea, fans quickly embraced it—especially imagining Taylor Swift as his perfect Barbie counterpart. The conversation may have started as a joke, but it’s sparking real buzz across social media.In a recent episode of the New Heights podcast , Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce found himself at the center of an unexpected pop culture moment—not on the football field, but in the toy aisle. After Mattel announced a Ken doll modeled after NBA superstar LeBron James, Kelce and his brother Jason couldn’t help but joke about who might be next. Naturally, the conversation drifted to Travis himself.Jason Kelce teased, “Next up, the Travis Kelce Ken Barbie,” sparking laughter from his brother. Travis quickly brushed off the idea, saying, “I don’t think people desire that.” But Jason wasn’t having it. “You’re out of your mind if you think people don’t desire that,” he fired back, echoing what many fans were already thinking.As social media lit up with playful mock-ups and fan reactions, the thought of a Travis Ken doll—complete with a two-piece suit, shades, and a mini Super Bowl ring—began to sound more like marketing gold than a podcast gag. Kelce even joked about the potential outfit, saying, “Nice little two-piece... I just love a good two-piece.”But this goes beyond just another toy. It’s a symbol of Kelce’s growing influence outside the NFL. Thanks to his high-profile romance with global icon Taylor Swift, Travis Kelce is no longer just a football star—he's become a pop culture powerhouse. A potential doll pairing of Travis and Taylor as Ken and Barbie taps into a cultural moment where fandoms collide and identities blur across sports, music, and entertainment.Mattel’s recent decision to create a LeBron James Ken marked a shift in how male athletes are perceived in the Barbie universe. Traditionally relegated to background roles, Ken dolls modeled after sports legends like LeBron—and potentially Travis—are redefining masculinity in the mainstream.And let’s not ignore the timing. With Travis at the peak of his career and his personal life making constant headlines, a Ken doll version of him would almost certainly fly off shelves. Add Taylor Swift’s massive global fanbase into the mix, and the demand is already built in.Also Read: Travis Kelce’s retirement rumors grow louder as Chiefs reportedly eye explosive college star to replace him in 2025 NFL Draft What began as a playful podcast moment may have just sparked a million-dollar idea—and fans are more than ready for their favorite power couple to hit the toy scene in style.","Travis Kelce downplays Ken doll idea while fans imagine Barbie dream life with Taylor Swift.

Shaq calls out Tom Brady’s sensitivity after Netflix roast rules

“Slap The S*** Out Of Tom Brady” Karlous Miller CALLS OUT Stephen A & Tom Brady And Has Shaq Dying

Despite his love for comedy, Shaquille O’Neal admits it scares him

Shaquille O’Neal is known as much for his playful personality as he is for his dominance on the basketball court. Whether it’s roasting Charles Barkley on Inside the NBA or supporting up-and-coming comedians, Shaq has always embraced humor. But even as one of the most beloved public figures in sports and entertainment, he has some surprisingly humble views on comedy—and even some criticism for NFL icon Tom Brady .On a recent episode of The Big Podcast with Shaq, comedian Karlous Miller sparked an honest exchange when he brought up Tom Brady’s reaction to jokes during his Netflix roast. “Ain’t nobody scared of Tom Brady though. I’d slap the sh*t out of Tom Brady,” Miller quipped. Shaq didn’t flinch and agreed, simply saying, “That is true.”Brady, known for his competitive fire, seemed less enthusiastic about being the butt of certain jokes during the Netflix special The Roast of Tom Brady . While he allowed most of the jabs to fly, he made it clear that jokes involving his children or Robert Kraft’s massage scandal were off-limits. When Jeff Ross crossed that line, Brady reportedly told him, “Don’t say that sh*t again.”For Shaq, who famously allowed comedians to go all in during the Shaquille O’Neal All-Star Comedy Jam, this kind of sensitivity doesn’t sit well. Shaq has always maintained that “everything is on the table” when it comes to humor, and his own career has proven he lives by that standard.Though Shaq has helped launch the careers of comedians like Kevin Hart , who rose to fame after headlining Shaq’s 2009 comedy jam, he surprisingly harbors a fear of stand-up himself. During a podcast with comedian Tom Segura, the NBA Hall of Famer confessed, “Comedy scares me, it really does.”Segura was stunned. “You’re such a showman,” he said, encouraging Shaq to trust his natural sense of humor. While many see him as effortlessly funny, Shaq still views comedy as a vulnerable, high-pressure craft.Also Read: Tom Brady hints at betrayal and ‘willful blindness’ as Gisele Bündchen gets closer to her new baby daddy While fans are used to seeing Shaq laughing on the sidelines, one can’t help but wonder—would he ever brave his own roast?

For now, though, he remains the big man who loves to laugh—but draws the line at picking up a mic himself.","Shaquille O’Neal has always embraced comedy, but admits it scares him.

Travis Kelce is the golden retriever boyfriend fans adore



Other celebrity men who fit the golden retriever mold

In the ever-evolving world of internet dating trends, one charming archetype is capturing the hearts of social media users everywhere: the golden retriever boyfriend . And at the forefront of this lovable category is none other than NFL star Travis Kelce , whose relationship with Taylor Swift has turned into a viral blueprint for modern romance.Defined by celebrity matchmaker Alessandra Conti, a golden retriever boyfriend is “a man who has boundless enthusiasm, is emotionally available, loyal, playful, super-affectionate, warm, and is a devoted, healthy, and delightful long-term partner, especially after a woman has experienced a less-than-fabulous relationship.” Travis Kelce, who proudly hypes up Swift during her music video shoots and openly supports her career, has become the internet's favorite example of this trend.As Conti puts it, “He is not afraid to hype up his partner and does not hide his affection for her either.” This vulnerability and admiration have earned Kelce a rare kind of affection from fans—and set a new standard for what many women now seek in a partner.What makes this pairing even more compelling is the viral contrast between Kelce’s golden retriever energy and Swift’s so-called black cat girlfriend persona—a term used to describe women who are independent, mysterious, and emotionally reserved. Together, they represent a new kind of compatibility: the warm, extroverted man who balances and supports a fiercely private and strong partner.Kelce isn’t the only one to carry the golden retriever title. Fans have also labeled John Krasinski, Tom Holland, Glen Powell, and Ryan Reynolds as prime examples of this affectionate, loyal personality type. “John Krasinski is a classic example of golden retriever boyfriend energy. He has graduated from boyfriend to husband and has been the trusty and supportive companion to wife Emily Blunt since 2010,” says Conti.Tom Holland, known for his thoughtful support of Zendaya, is another fan favorite. His decision to avoid physical contact with other women in public settings speaks volumes about his loyalty.This lighthearted social trend has a deeper significance—it reflects shifting dynamics in modern relationships . The rise of emotionally intelligent, supportive men being celebrated online marks a cultural pivot away from the emotionally distant archetypes of the past.As one fan put it, “Travis Kelce is why I want a golden retriever boyfriend.” In an era where emotional safety is just as sexy as physical chemistry, it’s clear the golden retriever boyfriend isn’t just a trend—it’s a new relationship ideal.Also Read: Taylor Swift snubbed by close celeb friend at Super Bowl as tensions and true motives spark speculation","Travis Kelce's relationship with Taylor Swift has turned into a viral blueprint for modern romance.

Lil Wayne slammed the NFL for not choosing him to perform at the Super Bowl’s half time show, but gets brutally trolled



Kendrick Lamar’s performance at Super Bowl LIX sparked major backlash



The Super Bowl LIX was a dramatic affair, and now Lil Wayne has added on to the drama, two months after it all went down.

It was perfect.""Lil Wayne continued, ""I blame myself for not being mentally prepare for a letdown and for just automatically mentally putting myself in that position. I thought there was nothing better than that spot, that stage, that platform, in my city.”He added, ""So it hurt, it hurt a whole lot.""While Lil Wayne seems really heartbroken about the whole situation, fans are not really happy with his reaction.

You sound cloud rappers is something else dawg.”Another fan wrote, “Growing up is realizing Wayne performing for more than 3 minutes at a halftime show would be disastrous.”A third fan posted, “Lil Wayne was not entitled to a Super Bowl performance. I feel like people around him or social media made him think he was robbed, but he wasn't. This victim mentality from Wayne makes me lose respect for him.”Another user wrote, “The tears and entitlement, my goodness”, while a fifth fan noted, “Bro acting like the Super Bowl organisers are going to ever call him either now or in the future. Let it go Wayne.”Another fan commented, “Lil Wayne saying he is no longer interested in doing the Super Bowl Halftime Show is funny considering he wasn’t even thinking about it until people put the bug in his ear that it should be him instead of Kendrick Lamar.”Kendrick Lamar took the stage at the Super Bowl halftime and performed his infamous hit track, “Not Like Us”. The track has been linked to Drake and is considered a diss track against him.Drake’s rumoured ex girlfriend and famous former tennis player, Serena Williams also joined Kendrick Lamar, triggering mixed reactions from fans.

When hockey goals and relationship goals come together



Instagram official in Greece, engaged in Spain—this couple gets romance right



Leon Draisaitl is accustomed to turning heads with his NHL wizardry, but it's not only his on-ice domination that the fans are rooting for. The Edmonton Oilers sensation has been winning off the ice as well—with a romance from the movies, courtesy of his fiancée, Canadian actress and model Celeste Desjardins From Sudbury, Ontario, Celeste Desjardins made a name for herself in the world of entertainment—showing up in TV hits such as Lost & Found and Taken and collaborating with big fashion brands.With a magnetic online presence, Celeste Desjardins has opened doors for her fans into her world—red carpet sightings to puppy playdates.

Whether they're cheering from the stands, globe-trotting to exotic locales, or sharing low-key moments with their dog, Bowie, Leon Draisaitl and Celeste Desjardins are one of hockey's most beloved power couples.The romance started in 2018, when Celeste Desjardins shared a dreamy holiday photo with Leon Draisaitl in Kos, Greece.
