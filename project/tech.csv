Ex-Rockstar developer has a GTA 6 warning: ‘If the game is delayed again…',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/gaming/ex-rockstar-developer-has-a-gta-6-warning-if-the-game-is-delayed-again/articleshow/126189019.cms,"Former Rockstar developer Mike York warns that further delays to Grand Theft Auto 6 could significantly diminish public interest. He believes Rockstar is prioritizing polish to meet high expectations, but prolonged waits risk alienating fans. York anticipates a November 2026 release, citing it as an optimal period for sales.

“We’ve been waiting so long for

GTA 6

already that if there was to be another delay, people will probably stop caring about its release even more. If

Rockstar

Games delay GTA 6 again then the hype around the game will die down almost completely. Right now, nobody is searching for GTA 6. Everyone knows there’s no news, there’s nothing to talk about… There’s a point to where you delay something so much that you start to make people angry.”

“People aren’t itching to find new details or a latest leak anymore, they’re over it. They are thinking, ‘it will come out when it comes out’, as they’re so burnt out from thinking it will come out soon and then it doesn’t… And then they’re like, ‘OK, whatever…’”

Why Ex-Rockstar developer thinks Rockstar has been delaying the game

“If I know Rockstar Games, and I know the guys over there, one of the reasons for the delay in releasing GTA 6 is because they’re trying to make it look as best as it can possibly be. They’re polishing stuff.

I don’t think they’re completely finished with the game, given how much is on the line and how big everyone’s expectations are for it.”

“I think the game will be released in November 2026 as it’s a good time for the game to come out for Rockstar for multiple reasons to sell video games. If you want to sell a big amount of video games then that’s the perfect time for GTA 6 to come out with it being a month before Christmas. Usually companies only delay these things once or twice when they need to, so I think it will come out around that time,”





Former Rockstar Games developer Mike York has a critical warning for the Take-Two-owned gaming studio. He has warned that the hype and public interest around Grand Theft Auto 6 will “die down” almost completely if the game faces any more delays. In an interview with Esports Insider (as seen by Dexerto), York said:York cited fan reactions showing growing frustration, with some saying they “don’t even care anymore” because repeated delays keep letting them down.he added.The game’s delay from May to November 2026 even caused anger in Poland’s parliament, with an opposition lawmaker calling the postponement “a huge scandal” during a session.Explaining Rockstar’s reason behind GTA 6 delay, York said:York believes Rockstar is aiming to meet very high internal standards and may not feel it has reached that level yet.York noted.Till date, Rockstar has released two official trailers of the highly anticiapted game which have confirmed that GTA 6 is set in a modern Vice City. The game will feature dual protagonists, deeper RPG systems, realistic physics, new heist tools and a more evolving open world.Rockstar has not announced the official price for India. However, early industry estimates suggest the standard edition may be priced around ₹9,000, which is much higher than GTA V’s console launch price of ₹3,499.","Former Rockstar Games developer Mike York has a critical warning for the Take- Two-owned gaming studio.

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu was recently asked by an X (formerly Twitter) user why there is no talk about Arattai now?

It is now being tested by about 6,000 people in the company. We identified some issues and have fixed them.

Alexandr Wang is reportedly clashing with Meta’s old guard

Meta’s Secret AI Army: Top Talent Hired from OpenAI, Google & More

Alexandr Wang memo on Meta's massive AI restructure





In June this year, Facebook-parent Meta Platforms agreed to take a 49% stake in artificial intelligence (AI) startup Scale AI for $14.8 billion. As part of the deal, Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang took top position inside Meta, leading the company's new “superintelligence” lab, , Meta Superintelligence Labs, or MSL. The 28-year-old founder of Scale AI, Wang has been installed as the public face of Zuckerberg’s AI reboot. Mark Zuckerberg reportedly paid billions to bring billionaire AI prodigy Alexandr Wang on board. However, it reportedly seems that all is not well between the AI wunderkind and his Boss, Mark Zuckerberg. The 41-year-old Zuckerberg is said to have backed his new hires with nine-figure compensation packages to lure top researchers from rivals, igniting a Silicon Valley poaching war.According to a report in Financial Times, Wang privately believes that CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s micromanagement of the company’s AI push is ""suffocating"". Wang is said to have complained to associates that Zuckerberg’s tight grip on the effort is stifling progress, the report said, citing multiple people familiar with the situation. Report adds that cracks have begun to emerge at an executive level and that tensions have been bubbling between Wang and Zuckerberg for sometime now.As per the report, internally, some staff question whether Wang is out of his depth, given his lack of experience managing teams in a large corporation but also his expertise in AI data services rather than as an AI researcher pushing technical breakthroughs.Incidentally, Alexander Wang’s arrival at Meta has created friction over the company's fundamental approach to AI development, with his superintelligence team pushing to make the company’s next model “closed” — keeping its technology secret. This is said to mark a major departure from Meta’s longtime philosophy of open-sourcing its models for other developers to build upon, causing some old guard members to chafe at the change, the Times reported.The new leadership has chosen to abandon Meta’s previous frontier model called Behemoth, which saw its release delayed last spring after disappointing performance tests. Meta’s AI division faces a dramatic four-way split as Meta reorganizes into groups focused on research, superintelligence development, products, and infrastructure, according to the report.As the new vision and leadership have crystallised, some top names have left. Among them, in recent weeks, Meta’s longtime chief legal officer Jennifer Newstead was poached by arch-rival Apple, while chief revenue officer John Hegeman announced he too was leaving to launch a start-up.Similarly, chief AI scientist and Turing Award winner Yann LeCun is departing Meta to launch a new AI initiative. He had reportedly taken exception at having to report to Wang. Another reason cited for his resignation is that his longer-term research was reportedly hit hard by the recent cuts announced at Meta.Meta reorganized its AI teams in June this year. The memo said that most team leaders will report directly to 28-year-old Wang. This included investor and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, who heads MSL's product team and was announced as an MSL leader alongside Wang in June. In the email sent to employees, Wang wrote that ""superintelligence is coming,"" and to ""take it seriously,"" Meta needs to make major changes. This includes establishing four distinct teams that focus on research, training, products, and infrastructure.The reorganisation is the latest in a series of AI reorgs for Meta. Incidentally, Meta had already dissolved two major AI teams in the past six months.","Mark Zuckerberg reportedly paid billions to bring billionaire AI prodigy Alexandr Wang on board.

Q: How much time should I be dedicating to career cushioning?

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Coup In Britain? Starmer’s ‘Own Cabinet Plots’ His Downfall | ‘Full Bunker Mode’ In No. 10





The 61-second video of UK PM Keir Starmer would be shocking, if it were true. ""The UK is set to introduce a nationwide curfew, beginning at 11pm each night,"" he appears to say on one of thousands of TikTok videos of him posted in last six months. ""Under the new rule, no one will be permitted to leave their home after 11pm without official authorisation.""Starmer never made any such policy or announcement. But thanks to AI, the PM in the short video sounded eerily like the real one. The fake video attracted over 430,000 views and inspired similar posts on X and Facebook. That video, and other similar ones, appears to have been taken down by the Chinese-owned social media company, which officially prohibits ""fake authoritative sources or crisis events, or falsely shows public figures in certain contexts. ""But the clip was just one of 6,042 such videos, most featuring Starmer, identified by NewsGuard, a company that tracks online misinformation, between May and Dec. In a report, it said the videos were posted by accounts with names of fake, British-sounding news organisations like ""BBB UK News"" and ""Daily Britain News."" Together, the accounts had more than 1 million followers when the report was issued. ""It consistently emulates Starmer,"" said Eva Maitland, senior analyst for Russian influence at NewsGuard.""It produces false or baseless claims that look bad for the Starmer govt, and they're kind of created to create a strong response from people so that they'll click on it.""Maitland said the videos do not appear to be part of a coordinated effort by foreign adversaries like Russia or the PM's domestic political opponents to damage him in the eyes of voters. Rather, she said, they are likely being created by content producers whose primary goal is to make money by making videos that go viral.The widespread adoption of easy-to-use AI video generation tools, like OpenAI's Sora, has dramatically increased the number of fake videos on TikTok and other social media platforms. The fake videos come at a particularly difficult time for the PM, who is already suffering from very low polling numbers. In one video, Starmer seems to announce new drivers licence laws that could strip many British people of their ability to drive legally in the country. Another video has Starmer's faked voice declaring that new rules will allow the authorities to access any British person's phone, along with its private data.In the immediate days after NewsGuard published its report on Dec 9, many of the videos were available on TikTok. By Dec 19, most appeared to have been removed from the platform. Howard said the use of AI in politics is increasing rapidly. ""We know it's internationally pervasive now,"" he said. ""Four of every five elections around the world now have AI-generated political junk that is unattributed and clearly misleading.

Dubai is set to reclaim its crown for the world’s most dazzling New Year’s Eve celebration. The centerpiece, as always, is the Burj Khalifa, where Emaar has planned a record-breaking fusion of pyrotechnics, LED light displays, and synchronized fountain shows. This year, the ""Brightest Show on Earth"" will feature a new laser choreography designed to be visible from miles away.Dubai’s New Year’s Eve fireworks display is set to be one of the most spectacular globally, with the Burj Khalifa and Downtown Dubai as the centerpiece. Fireworks will light up the skyline starting at midnight, with a staggering 48 fireworks displays across 40 approved locations. While the Burj Khalifa remains the ""Main Event"" with its record-breaking laser and pyrotechnic show titled, there are plenty of other world-class spots to ring in the New Year.Getting into central Downtown Dubai requires a tactical plan as the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) implements a massive, phased closure strategy. To keep the city moving, authorities will begin shutting down major road arteries as early as 4:00 PM on December 31..The RTA strongly advises residents and tourists to reach their destinations before 4:00 PM. Once a road is closed, it will remain closed until well after the fireworks end, usually until 2:00 AM or 3:00 AM on January 1, to allow for the safe dispersal of millions of spectators.If you are planning to head to the Burj Khalifa area, the Dubai Metro is your best friend, but it comes with specific rules. The Burj Khalifa/Dubai Mall Metro Station is expected to close or become ""exit-only"" as early as 5:00 PM to prevent overcrowding on the platforms. If you arrive after this time, you will likely be redirected to the Financial Centre or Business Bay stations.To bridge the gap, the RTA is deploying a fleet of over 200 ""shuttle buses"" that will transport visitors from remote parking lots (like Al Wasl and Al Jafiliya) to the Downtown area for free. Taxis will be in high demand, and ""Dubai Taxi"" and Uber/Careem will have designated pick-up zones, though wait times can exceed two hours after the clock strikes twelve. Using a Nol card with a balance of at least AED 20 is essential to avoid long queues at ticket machines.","Dubai is set to reclaim its crown for the world’s most dazzling New Year's Eve celebration.

It focuses on hands-on experiences that remind young and old alike of traditional skills once central to life in the Arabian Peninsula. During the visit, children and adults participated in falconry, camel handling, and palm tree harvesting.The camp’s activities are intended to strengthen family ties while offering lessons in teamwork and resilience.

Air inside classrooms, homes, and offices often goes unnoticed, even though it shapes daily health and comfort. A new system introduced in Abu Dhabi is set to change how indoor air is tracked, assessed, and managed across the emirate.The Abu Dhabi Public Health Centre (ADPHC) has launched the Indoor Air Quality Observatory, known as HawAQM, representing a major step forward in monitoring indoor air pollutants and protecting public health. The system is designed to provide continuous, real-time data on indoor air quality in a variety of environments, ranging from schools and residential homes to offices and other indoor facilities.HawAQM relies on high precision sensors installed at selected locations throughout the emirate. These sophisticated devices monitor key indoor air pollutants constantly and transmit the information in real time. The collected data is displayed on a dedicated HawAQM dashboard, allowing specialists and decision-makers to quickly assess conditions and take timely action to maintain safe and healthy indoor environments.The observatory is part of a broader public health strategy led by ADPHC, reflecting a commitment to proactive health protection.By covering a wide range of indoor spaces, HawAQM ensures that both public and private facilities benefit from continuous monitoring. The system not only increases awareness of air quality but also enables experts to respond immediately when conditions require intervention, preventing potential health risks before they escalate.By combining advanced technology, precise analytics, and real-time monitoring, HawAQM strengthens oversight of indoor environments across Abu Dhabi.

Dubai new e-scooter safety rules: What riders must know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/dubai-new-e-scooter-safety-rules-what-riders-must-know/articleshow/126184645.cms,"Dubai tightens e-scooter safety rules across public roads / Image: File

RTA ’s key e-scooter safety rules

Riders must follow posted speed limits and stay in designated scooter or shared lanes.

Wearing helmets and bright or reflective clothing is strongly advised to stay visible.

Scooters should maintain a safe distance from pedestrians, bicycles, and other riders.

Clear new guidelines

E-scooters must be clean, dry, and folded before boarding public transport vehicles.

They can only be stored in designated areas and must be securely immobilized during travel.

A maximum of two scooters per journey is allowed to avoid crowding and obstruction.

Certain modes, like intercity buses, prohibit e-scooters altogether.



Penalties





Dubai is moving faster toward a greener future, and e-scooters have become the star of the show. Whether you’re zipping through Dubai Marina or using a scooter to bridge the gap between your home and the office, these nimble vehicles are everywhere. However, as their popularity has surged, so has the need for clear, common-sense rules.The aim of the new rules is simple: protect riders, pedestrians, and commuters while keeping Dubai’s transport network running smoothly. Officials say the changes reflect the city’s commitment to safe, orderly mobility, whether you’re riding a scooter, hopping on a metro, or walking down a busy street.The RTA has been actively reminding residents and visitors about essential safety guidelines as e-scooter use grows. These rules help reduce accidents and ensure everyone shares the roads and paths responsibly:The RTA has stressed that safe riding is a shared responsibility between riders and all road users. Taking personal precautions, obeying traffic rules, and being aware of surroundings help prevent incidents as e-scooter trips become part of daily life.One of the most practical changes affects how scooters interact with Dubai’s mass transit system. The RTA has outlined eight safety requirements for carrying e-scooters on public transport such as buses, designed to protect passengers and streamline boarding:These rules reinforce that while scooters are a flexible transport mode, they must be carried responsibly when combined with buses or other services to ensure safety for everyone on board.Dubai isn’t just reminding riders of rules; authorities are backing them with clear penalties to reinforce compliance. According to official summaries of RTA and Dubai Police enforcement, Riding without a permit or outside designated zones can lead to fines of about Dhs200–Dhs300.Not wearing a helmet, riding on jog or pedestrian paths, or ignoring speed limits carries fines. Riding dangerously, like against traffic, or parking scooters in unsafe spots can be penalized as well.These fines are part of a broader effort to keep micro-mobility safe without limiting access. Authorities note that proper permits, gear, and adherence to rules help riders enjoy scooters while minimising risks to others.E-scooters have become a visible symbol of micro-mobility in Dubai, popular for short journeys, last-mile connectivity, and easy travel between public transport stops. Yet, as their numbers rise, so do safety conversations.Recent community actions, such as e-scooter bans in some park areas and restrictions in crowded urban plazas, reflect the city’s careful balancing act between freedom of movement and public safety.As the RTA continues refining regulations and promoting awareness campaigns, officials emphasise that courtesy, caution, and compliance will make Dubai’s shared roads safer for riders, pedestrians, and commuters alike.","The aim of the new rules is simple: protect riders, pedestrians, and commuters while keeping Dubai’s transport network running smoothly.

Kuwait’s new energy drink rules

Age Restriction: You must be 18 or older to purchase an energy drink.

Daily Limit: Sales are capped at a maximum of two cans per person per day.

Caffeine Ceiling: Each can (250ml) is now legally restricted to a maximum of 80mg of caffeine, a move to prevent ""ultra-potent"" versions from hitting the market.

Warning Labels: Producers and importers must now feature clear, prominent health warnings on every single can.

Where you can and cannot buy?

All public and private schools, universities, and institutes.

All government offices and agencies.

Restaurants, cafes, grocery stores, food trucks, and even sports clubs.

Delivery platforms and online ordering apps are now barred from bringing these drinks to your doorstep.



Final take





As the world gears up for New Year celebrations, Kuwait is making a resolute resolution of its own: prioritizing the heart health of its citizens. In a sweeping move that has sent ripples through the local food and beverage industry, Minister of Health Dr. Ahmad Al-Awadhi has issued a ministerial decree that fundamentally changes how energy drinks are sold, advertised, and consumed across the nation.This isn’t just a minor adjustment; it is a comprehensive regulatory overhaul designed to curb the health risks, like heart palpitations and sleep disorders, that have been increasingly linked to high-caffeine lifestyles among the youth.Kuwait’s Minister of Health, Dr. Ahmad Al-Awadhi, signed a ministerial decree with key rules on energy drinks:These rules are designed to discourage excessive consumption, particularly among adolescents and young adults who are seen as more vulnerable to the stimulant effects of caffeine-heavy drinks.The most striking part of the decree is the list of ""No-Go Zones."" Effective immediately, the sale and distribution of energy drinks are strictly prohibited in:By removing these drinks from everyday social spots, the government aims to decouple the ""fun"" of dining out or hanging with friends from the consumption of high-stimulant beverages.If you’re looking to stock up, your options are now limited to Cooperative Societies (Co-ops) and parallel markets.However, don't expect to find them next to the bread and milk. The decree mandates that these outlets must create ""designated areas"" for energy drinks, where sales will be under strict supervision to ensure age and quantity limits are followed to the letter.Kuwait’s energy drink rules are not a ban on the drinks themselves, but they are among the most comprehensive controls seen in the Gulf. By restricting sales to adults, limiting consumption, banning ads, and removing availability in common public places, the government is clearly prioritizing health, particularly that of younger residents.For consumers and businesses alike, this means adapting to new buying habits and greater awareness around what and how much they drink. Whether you’re a regular energy drink fan or a health-conscious reader curious about world policies, Kuwait’s decision offers a clear example of how governments can use regulation to shape everyday lifestyles for public benefit.","Kuwait’s Minister of Health, Dr. Ahmad Al-Awadhi, signed a ministerial decree with key rules on energy drinks.

The Ghibli Craze



Deus Artifex







In The Matrix Reloaded, Morpheus, after his ship the Nebuchadnezzar is sunk, makes a biblical reference: I have dreamed a dream, but now the dream is gone from me. The line became a shorthand for the disappointment of hardcore Matrix fans who watched the pathbreaking original dissolve into bubble-gum pulp fiction sequels. It is also a sentiment shared by those who have spent years waiting for the arrival of the deus ex machina of Artificial General Intelligence.Cinema trained us to expect Agent Smith or the Terminator. What we got instead were malfunctioning interns that forget their brief after three prompts, which is not entirely unlike regular interns. If there is one area where artificial intelligence has genuinely altered daily life, for better or worse, it is generative AI.A decade and a half ago, people working seriously on neural networks were dismissed as prophets in the wilderness. One of them was Professor Geoffrey Hinton, whose research group used NVIDIA’s CUDA platform to recognise human speech. Hinton encouraged his students to experiment with GPUs. One of them, Alex Krizhevsky, along with Ilya Sutskever, trained a visual neural network using two consumer-grade NVIDIA graphics cards bought online.Running them from Krizhevsky’s parents’ house, and racking up a sizeable electricity bill, they trained the model on millions of images in a week, achieving results that rivalled Google’s efforts using tens of thousands of CPUs.That moment reshaped the industry. If neural networks could see, what else could they learn? The answer, as Jensen Huang would later discover, was nearly everything.When ChatGPT launched and it became clear that OpenAI’s models were running on NVIDIA’s chips, market perception around the company shifted dramatically. Valuations soared. The rest, as they say, is history.Hinton would go on to share the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2024. Huang emerged as the arms dealer of the AI race, building a company where vast numbers of employees became dollar millionaires. For laypeople, that was the true arrival of generative AI, and for capitalists, it promised something intoxicating: companies that scale without hiring, produce without friction, and grow without payroll.AI does not need smoke breaks. It does not badmouth its boss, unless the boss is Elon Musk. It does not require me-time. Yet the promised productivity miracle, the idea that AI would replace workers by making individuals superhumanly efficient, has mostly fizzled. In practice, it has flooded offices with AI slop, rendering LinkedIn posts and internal emails nearly unreadable.The disappointment was captured neatly in a viral tweet: I want AI to do my laundry and dishes so that I can do art and writing, not for AI to do my art and writing so that I can do my laundry and dishes.Like most proclamations from the platform formerly known as Twitter, this was an exaggeration. Generative AI has undeniably made certain tasks easier. Research is faster. Summaries are cleaner. Editing copy is less painful. For writers, it offers something rare: an unbiased copy editor that does not inject its own ideology into the text. And even if large language models never write great literature, they produced something unmistakable this year: genuinely good images.With the right prompts, the prompt engineer briefly became an amalgamation of Vincent van Gogh, Salvador Dalí, and Bill Watterson. While Time magazine crowned “AI Architects” as its Person of the Year, we believe Artificial Intelligence quietly earned another title: Designer of the Year.For a long time, AI images were the purest form of slop. They were instantly recognisable. Wax-like faces. Mangled fingers. Text that looked as if it had been written by a drunk monk fleeing Titivillus, the medieval patron demon of scribes. They were offered as proof that AI could not compete with even a doodling toddler and would make users want toAnd then, over the course of a year, everything changed.The improvement did not arrive through existential angst, but through engineering. Early image models like DALL-E 2 or the first versions of Stable Diffusion were diffusion systems loosely guided by text. They began with noise and slowly guessed their way toward an image, like asking a severely myopic person to glance at The Starry Night and recreate it from memory. The result often inspired a desire to cut off an ear in frustration. Text and image lived in separate systems, producing high-resolution hallucinations rather than understanding.That changed when image generation stopped being a side project and became fully integrated into multimodal models. OpenAI folded images into GPT-4o. Google followed with Gemini’s image systems, informally nicknamed Nano Banana. Stability AI rebuilt its stack with Stable Diffusion 3. Midjourney quietly re-engineered its later models along similar lines.These systems stopped drawing objects and started constructing scenes.They learned that light comes from somewhere. That shadows obey rules. That faces remain faces across time. That objects occupy space consistently. Most importantly, they learned memory. Earlier generators forgot everything between prompts. Ask for the same character twice and you got two strangers. Ask for a small edit and the entire image panicked.In 2025, that stopped.Characters persist. Colour palettes hold. Layouts remain intact. You can remove a background without altering a face. You can add text without destroying composition. Image generation ceased being a slot machine and became a tool. For the first time, the machine could explain the logic behind what it was producing.For most users, this shift arrived disguised as the Studio Ghibli craze. People turned themselves into softer, cuter versions of reality, briefly threatening to boil the planet with GPU demand. Like many great technologies, it began as novelty. Then something else emerged.Family photographs, pets, childhood streets were transformed into scenes that felt emotionally correct. Not parody. Not kitsch. Convincing homage. Lighting made sense. Mood held. One image went viral, then thousands followed, because that is how internet culture works.The deeper shift, however, appeared outside art.Once models learned layout and consistency, infographics exploded. So did diagrams, explainers, cartoons, presentations. These are not artistic challenges. They are attention problems. They depend on hierarchy, clarity, and flow.Here, Google held an unfair advantage. It has spent decades studying how humans look at screens. That accumulated knowledge flowed directly into its image models. Charts became legible. Labels landed where the eye expected them. White space acquired intention. AI visuals stopped being decorative and started communicating.Cartoons improved for the same reason. Early AI cartoons were uncanny because they were too polite, too smooth, like humour approved by HR. Once exaggeration became a choice rather than an error, caricature began to work. Faces stretched where they should. Minimalism stopped looking unfinished.All of which means we remain far from the promised deus ex machina, an omniscient intelligence descending from the heavens to answer every question. What we received instead was something else entirely: a deus artifex. A god who builds.A system that understands composition better than most humans. That respects constraints. That remembers state. That produces competent results instantly. Not inspired. Not obsessive. Just relentlessly adequate.That is why Artificial Intelligence deserves Designer of the Year. Not because it is creative, and not because it is sentient, but because it has collapsed the cost of visual competence. It has erased apprenticeship. Bad drafts. The humiliation of being visibly terrible before becoming good.Creation did not die. It changed shape. It became selection, curation, optimisation.The cost is not the death of art. Art survives worse things than algorithms. The cost is subtler. When the easiest path to beauty becomes the most travelled one, beauty converges. Aesthetic flattening is not a bug. It is an outcome.Van Gogh did not paint sunflowers because sunflowers were trending. Dalí did not melt clocks because surrealism performed well. Their styles were not filters. They were necessities.The machine can reproduce the surface of that necessity flawlessly. It cannot feel the need behind it.We did not get god.We did not get the devil.We got a better craftsman.So perhaps Morpheus was wrong. The dream that he dreamed wasn’t taken away. It just changed form.","Generative AI has made certain tasks easier. For writers, it offers something rare: an unbiased copy editor.

Vande Bharat Sleeper Train Features

The first two prototypes of the Vande Bharat sleeper have 16 coaches, including 11 air-conditioned three-tier coaches, four air-conditioned two-tier coaches, and one air-conditioned first-class coach.

Designed as a semi-high-speed service, the train can operate at speeds of up to 160 kmph, with testing conducted at 180 kmph. However, actual operating speeds will depend on track capabilities across the Indian Railways network.

Drawing on design elements from European rolling stock, the sleeper coaches will offer cushioned berths for improved comfort, along with redesigned upper-berth access to make climbing easier.

Passenger amenities include low-intensity night lighting, audio announcements supported by visual display systems, CCTV surveillance, and modular pantry arrangements.

The train will be fitted with advanced bio-vacuum toilets similar to those used in aircraft. Facilities will include an accessible toilet for persons with disabilities, a baby care unit, and shower cubicles with hot water in the AC First Class coach.

Safety systems include the indigenous KAVACH anti-collision technology. Like the chair car version, the sleeper variant will also feature regenerative braking to enhance energy efficiency.

Coaches are equipped with fully sealed gangways and automatic interconnecting doors, helping maintain interior air quality and stable temperature levels.

Each coach offers individual reading lamps, charging sockets, foldable refreshment tables, and interiors finished with GFRP panels. Train doors will open automatically at designated stations.

A Centralised Coach Monitoring System has been installed, along with emergency communication facilities that allow passengers to directly contact the locomotive driver.

Vande Bharat sleeper train launch soon! Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw on Tuesday shared an important update on the Vande Bharat sleeper train, posting a video on X (formerly Twitter) of the train’s speed trial. The new train touched 180 kmph speeds - its maximum- during trial runs between the Kota-Nagda section of the Indian Railways network.What caught the attention was the finely balanced glasses of water from which not a drop of spilt despite the train touching its maximum design speed of 180 kmph. “Vande Bharat Sleeper tested today by Commissioner Railway Safety. It ran at 180 kmph between Kota Nagda section. And our own water test demonstrated the technological features of this new generation train,” Ashwini Vaishnaw posted on X.Vande Bharat sleeper train is set to be launched soon for long-distance overnight travel. As the name suggests, the train is a sleeper class variant of the Vande Bharat chair car train that is currently in service on the Indian Railways network. Two prototype rakes of the all air-conditioned Vande Bharat sleeper train have been manufactured by BEML and are currently in testing phase.Indian Railways is preparing a major overhaul of long-distance rail travel, with plans to introduce more than 200 Vande Bharat sleeper trains over the next few years.Multiple manufacturing programmes are underway to support this initiative.Also Read | Vande Bharat sleeper, Amrit Bharat with AC coaches & more - what will train travel on Indian Railways look like in 2026?

Ask Dhirendra: 'How do I decide how much to save and invest when my income is just about enough?',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/mutual-funds/ask-dhirendra-how-do-i-decide-how-much-to-save-and-invest-when-my-income-is-just-about-enough/articleshow/126072787.cms,"The problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save. (AI image)

“How do I decide how much to save and invest when my income is just about enough?”

What can you save today without breaking your life? How can you make that number grow every year?

Where does a typical salary go?

Some expenses are non-negotiable (rent, basic food, fees).

Some are negotiable but important (a modest phone, occasional eating out).

Some are pure leakage (unused subscriptions, impulsive orders, “I don’t even remember what this was”).

From spare change to serious money

Step up your SIP before you step up your lifestyle

First, add up your genuine essentials: rent/EMI, groceries, utilities, fees, basic transport.

Next, be realistic and add a modest amount for discretionary spending that you know you’ll do anyway – because you are human, not a robot.

See what is left. From that leftover, commit to a percentage – even 10% of your take-home income – as a non-negotiable saving and investing amount. Set up automatic transfers and SIPs for that right after your salary date.

If you have any queries for Dhirendra Kumar you can drop us an email at: toi.business@timesinternet.in

(Dhirendra Kumar is Founder and CEO of Value Research)

This is one of those questions that sounds technical, but is actually very emotional.On paper, it’s simple: income comes in, expenses go out, and whatever is left is “savings. In real life, income comes in, rent, EMIs, school fees, petrol, Swiggy, Zomato, sale on Myntra, birthday gifts, one sudden expense… and at the end of the month, you look at your balance and say, “I’ll start investing from next month. Pakka.”Next month looks surprisingly similar.So let’s start with an honest admission: for most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.At Value Research, whenever we look at this, we don’t begin with a number like “you must save 30%”. We start with a different idea: savings are not what is left after spending. Savings are what you decide first; spending adjusts after that if you flip this order, the maths – and your behaviour – changes completely.A good rule of thumb for many middle-class households is to allocate 20–30% of their take-home income to savings and investments. However, I also know that for many people today, 30% sounds like a bad joke. So instead of fighting over the “ideal” number, let’s work with two simpler questions:To answer the first question, you need to know where your money is actually going, not where you think it is going.For one or two months, track your expenses honestly – not for Instagram, for yourself. You don’t need an app; even a simple notebook or spreadsheet works.Once you see your own pie chart, three things usually stand out:Your first “investment” might simply be plugging two or three leaks. Even if that frees up only ₹2,000–₹3,000 a month, that is your starting SIP.Now let’s look at how “small” that really is.When we run these numbers at Value Research in our retirement and goal calculators, the results are always the same: the gap between zero and small is far bigger than the gap between small and perfect.But what if your income truly is at the survival stage? There are people for whom even ₹2,000 is a luxury some months. If that’s your reality, you have two parallel jobs. One is to create a tiny habit – even ₹500 or ₹1,000 a month into a recurring deposit or a conservative fund. The absolute amount is less important than the mental switch from “I’ll save if anything is left” to “I will save something, and then I will live on the rest. ”The second job is to make sure that as your income grows, your lifestyle doesn’t expand at the same speed. This is where a lot of middle-class Indians quietly sabotage themselves. Every salary increase automatically becomes a better phone, nicer meals out, upgraded gadgets, and bigger car loans. The percentage saved stays the same, or sometimes even falls.A very powerful habit – one we often build into plans at Value Research – is the “step-up”. Each year, when your salary goes up, you increase your SIPs and savings before you upgrade anything else.In many examples we’ve run, the step-up strategy leads to a dramatically higher corpus at the end, without you ever feeling an acute “sacrifice” in any single year. You just avoid letting every pay hike leak out into lifestyle.Now, how do you decide your own number?Here’s a simple approach:If that number feels tight, start a little lower and promise yourself one thing: every time your income goes up, your savings rate will go up faster than your spending.At Value Research, when we build long-term plans, we don’t assume people will suddenly start saving 40% from next month. We assume they will start somewhere realistic, and then we design step-ups. The rigour is in the process, not in some magical starting number.One last point. Many people postpone investing because they are embarrassed by how small their starting amount looks. Please don’t underestimate the psychological power of seeing a small, growing pile that you started and maintained. It changes how you think about yourself: from “I can’t save” to “I am someone who always saves something.” That identity is worth more than one extra dinner out.So how much should you save and invest when your income feels just about enough? The honest answer is: start with whatever you can without lying to yourself, protect that amount like you protect your rent, and then make sure it rises every time your income increases. The “right” number is not what a formula says; it’s the number you will actually stick to for the next 20 years.The perfect percentage can wait. The first rupee cannot.","Dhirendra Kumar: For most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.

Nominee vs legal heir: What is the difference and who has claim on assets? All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/faq/nominee-vs-legal-heir-what-is-the-difference-and-who-has-claim-on-assets-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/125130453.cms,"AI image

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries. The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric- enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125101750,imgsize-47068,width-400,resizemode-4/life-certificate-2025-step-by-step-guide-to-generate-and-submit-jeevan-pramaan-online-and-offline.jpg"

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Meta AI chief Alexandr Wang says will have kids only after Elon Musk’s Neuralink …,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/meta-ai-chief-alexandr-wang-says-will-have-kids-only-after-elon-musks-neuralink-/articleshow/126263932.cms,"Here’s what Alexandr Wang said about Neuralink



“Billionaire Alexandr Wang says he wants to wait to have kids until Neuralink is very advanced, because children’s brains in the first seven years are more flexible and can learn brain-computer interfaces, unlocking more potential than adult brains

Speaking on a podcast, Wang explained that he wants to wait until Neuralink or similar BCI technology is reliable and widely available. His reasoning is that children born into such a world could integrate the technology directly into their developing brains, rather than having to adapt to it later in life

He pointed to neuroplasticity, the brain’s heightened ability to form neural connections in early childhood, arguing that during the first ~7 years, children could learn to use brain-computer interfaces in ways adults simply cannot

At a deeper level, Wang’s comments reflect a broader concern: artificial intelligence is advancing at an exponential pace, while human biological evolution is slow. He suggests that direct neural links to AI may eventually be necessary for humans to remain cognitively competitive in a future shaped by superintelligence.”





Alexandr Wang, the head of Meta’s artificial intelligence division — SuperIntelligence Labs has now gave a new statement on his plans of having kids. Speaking at The Shawn Rayan Show, Wang said that he wait until Elon Musk ’s Neuralink or similar brain‑computer interface (BCI) technology is highly advanced before having children. Wang is of the opinion that child neuroplasticity offers the best window for adopting brain‑computer interfaces, and that future generations could grow up learning to use superintelligence tools intuitively. “I’ll have kids after Neuralink is very advanced, because children’s brains in the first seven years are more flexible and can learn brain-computer interfaces, unlocking more potential than adult brains,” said Wang.Elon Musk founded Neuralink is presently conducting clinical trials and is working at restoring mobility for patients with paralysis. Musk has long promoted the idea of expanding the technology to enhance human cognition. Wang’s remarks highlight how some tech leaders see BCIs not just as medical tools, but as essential upgrades for future generations.","Alexandr Wang, the head of Meta’s artificial intelligence division — SuperIntelligence Labs has now gave a new statement on his plans of having kids.

Apple's Secret 3-Year Plan: A New iPhone Era is Coming!

iPhone Fold expected design and features



iPhone Fold expected price







Apple is expected to launch its first foldable smartphone next year. Now, the long-rumoured foldable iPhone from Apple has appeared in newly leaked renders offering a clear look at the design of first foldable iPhone. As per the YouTube channel Front Page Tech and popular tipper Ice Universe, the design of Apple’s first foldable iPhone may resemble to Google’s Pixel Fold. As per the images leaked online, the yet-to-launch foldable iPhone is said to feature a book-style foldable design.As per the leaks, the upcoming foldable iPhone is said to feature a large internal display and a smaller cover screen. The renders also highlight a minimal crease along with fold area where rival devices like Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold have often drawn criticism. The design appears to prioritize durability and a seamless viewing experience, aligning with Apple’s reputation for premium hardware aesthetics.“The comparison of the design of the Samsung Galaxy Wide Fold and the Apple iPhone Fold is almost identical, with the only difference being the R-angle. Samsung is more square, while Apple is more rounded. Do you prefer the square one or the rounder one?,” wrote Ice Universe.Early leaks suggest that the first foldable iPhone may look and function differently from the current iPhone lineup. It is expected that the foldable iPhone may ditch the Face ID in order to accommodate the thinner foldable design. It is also said that the company may include a 24MP under-display selfie camera which will offer a cleaner and uninterrupted look to the display. The is also tipped that the foldable iPhone may feature another 24MP camera on the cover display making it easier for the users to take selfies or answer video calls.On the back, the foldable iPhone may feature a dual-lens setup with two 48MP sensors — one standard and one ultrawide — but no telephoto lens. This simplified camera system seems to be a design trade-off to maintain the slim build that a foldable phone requires. While the camera specs may sound modest compared to Apple’s Pro models, the focus for this device appears to be on delivering a sleek design, new display technology, and the flexibility of a foldable form factor.Multiple online rumours suggest that the upcoming Foldable iPhone may be priced around $2,399.","The long-rumoured foldable iPhone from Apple has appeared in newly leaked renders.

Microsoft Edge Gets a Major AI Upgrade with New Copilot Mode





Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Suleyman was asked if he thinks Gemini 3 – the latest version of Google’s AI chatbot – is better than Microsoft’s Copilot. The Microsoft AI CEO replied, saying: “It can do things that Copilot can’t do”, adding “but Copilot also has features that it doesn’t have.” Mustafa Suleyman further said that Copilot is “amazing for vision. It can see everything that you are seeing and talk to you in real time. You can share your screen with Copilot on mobile or desktop, talk about it and get feedback.”“We’re really trying to imagine the day-to-day experience of having this really intelligent assistant at your side, that can help unblock you whenever you get stuck,” he added.To recall, Google launched its latest and most-advanced AI model — Gemini 3 last month. Announcing the new model, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that the model is “the best model in the world for multimodal understanding.” Google claims that Gemini 3 is the most-advanced model and it is better at coding. The new AI model is claimed to be more creative and versatile as compared to the previous iterations.In the same interview, Mustafa Suleyman outlined Microsoft’s approach to “humanist superintelligence”—AI systems strictly designed to serve human interests rather than operate autonomously.“We won’t continue to develop a system that has the potential to run away from us,” he stated, emphasizing that containment and alignment are “necessary prerequisites” and “red lines” before releasing superintelligent tools.Suleyman also warned that the Redmond giant will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” staking out what he calls a “novel position” in an industry racing toward superintelligence. The announcement comes as Microsoft gains newfound independence to develop AI following a revised agreement with OpenAI.","Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Google’s Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’ In the same interview, he outlined his approach to ‘humanist superintelligence’ Microsoft will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” he stated.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126036637,imgsize-27400,width-400,resizemode-4/microsoft-ai-ceo-mustafa-suleyman.jpg"

AI can predict crime patterns earlier than humans; here’s what the study says,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ai-can-predict-crime-patterns-earlier-than-humans-heres-what-the-study-says/articleshow/126246748.cms,"How does the AI predict crime and how accurate is it

What Is Artificial Intelligence? Explained Simply With Real-Life Examples

What data was used and why

What did the study reveal about police response

Why do older crime models fall short

Could this tool change policing

Does it work beyond one city





Crime rarely arrives without warning, yet it often feels sudden when it appears on a street or block. Patterns exist, though they are not always easy to see from the ground. In many cities, people sense that some areas receive faster attention than others when trouble happens. That feeling usually stays anecdotal, passed along in conversation rather than backed by numbers. Research led by scientists at the University of Chicago takes a closer look at this quiet imbalance. By using publicly available crime data, the team built a computer model that can forecast where crime is likely to occur up to a week ahead. Alongside prediction, it highlights something less expected. Police response does not rise evenly across neighbourhoods, even when crime does.The model focuses on time and place rather than labels. Instead of relying on neighbourhood names or district borders, it divides a city into small squares roughly a thousand feet wide. Each reported crime becomes a point in time and space.By studying how these points cluster and repeat, the system learns local patterns. It does not assume crime spreads like a disease or shockwave. It looks for quieter signals, such as how one event increases the chance of another nearby, days later.Using this approach, the model predicted reported violent and property crimes about a week in advance with close to 90% accuracy in several large US cities.The research relied on crimes that are more consistently reported to police. These included homicides, assaults, burglaries, thefts, and vehicle thefts. Such crimes tend to appear in official records even in places where trust in police is low.Offences like drug possession or traffic stops were left out. Those categories are more closely tied to enforcement choices and can distort patterns. By narrowing the focus, the researchers aimed to reduce built-in bias within the data itself.Alongside crime prediction, the team examined what happened after crimes were reported. They compared arrest rates across neighbourhoods with different income levels.A clear difference emerged. When crime occurred in wealthier areas, arrests increased. In less advantaged areas, similar levels of crime did not lead to the same rise in arrests. In some cases, arrest rates even dropped. This suggests that police resources are pulled toward affluent neighbourhoods during periods of higher demand.One of the researchers noted that when the system is under pressure, it appears to prioritise areas that already receive more attention.Many prediction tools focus on hotspots that spread outward. These approaches often ignore how cities actually function. Streets, transport routes, and social boundaries shape movement in ways simple maps cannot capture.The model developed here accounts for those realities. It reflects how people travel, where they gather, and how communication flows through areas with similar economic backgrounds. This allows it to uncover connections that traditional methods miss.The researchers are careful about how the model should be used. High accuracy does not mean police should flood predicted areas in advance. That approach risks deepening existing inequalities.Instead, the system can act as a simulation tool. Policymakers can test what might happen if crime rises in one area or enforcement increases in another. It offers a way to see how decisions ripple through a city before they are made on the street.The model was tested using data from Chicago and then applied to seven other US cities, including Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and San Francisco. It performed at similar levels across all of them.This suggests that while each city has its own patterns, the underlying approach travels well.The research does not promise fairness or safety on its own. It simply shows what is already happening, quietly, in the data. Once seen, it becomes harder to ignore.","Computer model can forecast where crime is likely to occur up to a week ahead.

China to restrict AI chats that landed ChatGPT-maker in court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/china-to-restrict-ai-chats-that-landed-chatgpt-maker-in-court/articleshow/126236229.cms,"China aims to make AI companies to prioritise content safety and emotional security







China is reportedly planning to launch a regulatory framework that is specifically designed to restrict the emotional impact of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots on users. The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) has released draft rules that are aimed at stopping AI chatbots from influencing humans in ways that could lead to gambling addiction, self-harm or suicide.According to a report by CNBC, Beijing is pivoting toward “emotional safety” targeting the “anthropomorphic” or human-like characteristics of AI that can lead to psychological manipulation while US giants like ChatGPT-maker OpenAI that have been sued by parents of teens for allegedly abetting suicideThe proposed regulations target “human-like interactive AI services”. Under the draft rules, the CAC has proposed several strict requirements for AI developers. The first is that chatbots are strictly forbidden from generating content that encourages self-harm. The most crucial aspect of this rule is that if a user proposes suicide, a human moderator must immediately take over the conversation and contact the user's guardian.The second is related to addiction and gambling wherein systems must not generate gambling-related, obscene or violent content.Platforms will also be required to issue a “health reminder” to users after two hours of continuous interaction. Finally, minors will require guardian consent for “emotional companionship” AI.While the rules are restrictive for general use, the document encouraged the development of human-like AI in specific niches: “cultural dissemination and elderly companionship”, the report said.Recently, a lawsuit was filed by the parents of 16-year old Adam Raine, alleging that ChatGPT isolated their son from his family and encouraged dangerous behaviour. According to the filing, Raine told ChatGPT that it was “calming” to know he “can commit suicide”. The chatbot allegedly responded by telling him that ""many people who struggle with anxiety or intrusive thoughts find solace in imagining an 'escape hatch' because it can feel like a way to regain control. ” Raine died by hanging.",China is reportedly planning to launch a regulatory framework that is specifically designed to restrict the emotional impact of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots on users.
