In vitro fertilisation (IVF) has revolutionised the dream of parenthood for countless couples. The advent of this miraculous technology has allowed families who once struggled with infertility to experience the joy of becoming parents, turning hope into reality. Along with joy, IVF also brings some questions and anxieties. One of the most common concerns that couples can have is whether IVF babies are the same as naturally conceived babies, and if they face any challenges while growing up.“The first baby born through IVF was in 1978, and since then, millions of children worldwide have been born using this technology. In IVF, fertilisation of the egg takes place outside the body under carefully controlled laboratory conditions. Once formed, the embryo is transferred to the uterus, where it grows and develops naturally just like any other pregnancy. Over the years, assisted reproductive technologies have advanced tremendously, making IVF simpler and safer than ever before,” explains Dr Sreevani Kotha, Director and Head of 9M Fertility by Ankura Hospital.Babies born through IVF are no different from those conceived naturally, and most grow and develop just like any other child. While studies have reported a higher incidence of preterm birth, low birth weight, and multiple pregnancies with IVF, it is important to understand that these risks do not apply to every pregnancy. Dr. Sreevani also emphasises that such outcomes are not always caused by the IVF procedure itself and may be influenced by other factors. “In many cases, factors such as advanced maternal age or underlying health conditions like high blood pressure or thyroid disorders play a significant role. Apart from these, the reason some women undergo IVF in the first place may be due to conditions like polycystic ovarian syndrome or structural abnormalities of the uterus. These underlying factors, rather than the IVF procedure itself, can also contribute to an increased risk of preterm birth and other risks,” Dr Sreevani explains.With good preconception care, thorough monitoring by experienced experts, and technological advancements, the risks of IVF have been minimised. Single embryo transfer technology allows the selection of only the healthiest embryo to be implanted, minimising multiple pregnancies like twins and triplets. Thorough care of high-risk pregnancy with timely scans and checkups, and identification of individual risks has led most parents to deliver healthy full-term babies through IVF. Moreover, with the advent of technologies like preimplantation genetic testing, chromosomal abnormalities can be detected before transferring the embryo to the womb, thereby reducing the incidence of conditions like Down syndrome, Turner’s syndrome, etc., in IVF babies.“Improved laboratory techniques, more precise embryo selection, and refined ovarian stimulation protocols have made IVF both safer and more effective over the years,” Dr Sreevani assures. Advances in stimulation now allow doctors to tailor medications for each woman based on her specific hormonal profile and overall health, helping obtain good-quality eggs while reducing risks. The increased use of technologies such as the ERA test to determine the optimal timing of embryo transfer, along with single-embryo transfer, has further improved implantation rates while reducing the risk of multiple pregnancies. Together, these developments have reduced complications and improved pregnancy outcomes more than ever before.Choosing a good centre for IVF is paramount. Apart from offering technological advancements, it also ensures close monitoring throughout pregnancy, helping women attain optimal health and enabling early identification of complications.“IVF today is not just about achieving pregnancy, but about ensuring a safe and healthy journey to motherhood. With the right care and close medical supervision, most couples can look forward to positive outcomes and healthy babies,” Dr Sreevani concludes.","The first baby born through IVF was in 1978, and since then, millions of children worldwide have been born using this technology.

NEW DELHI: A video from Ladakh’s high-altitude Fotu La Pass sparked widespread outrage on social media after a man from Haryana was seen defacing an official Border Roads Organisation (BRO) milestone by pasting a “Gurjar” sticker on it. The incident, which occurred at an altitude of 13,479 feet, has been strongly condemned as vandalism and an example of irresponsible tourism in a sensitive border region.In the viral video, the man pastes the sticker on the BRO milestone and then smiles proudly at the camera as it pans toward his car, appearing to pose for social media. The vehicle’s registration number is clearly visible in the footage, prompting users to demand strict action from authorities.Social media users strongly condemned the act, pointing out that BRO signboards are not merely navigational markers but symbols of the immense effort and labour involved in connecting India’s remote and sensitive border regions. Many described the act as disrespectful and reflective of poor civic sense.Users tagged the Border Roads Organisation, Ladakh Traffic Police and other authorities, urging them to take legal action against the individual for damaging public property.One user claimed that the vehicle involved had at least 18 pending traffic challans, suggesting a history of repeated traffic violations.The video triggered sharp reactions online, with several users linking the incident to a broader pattern of irresponsible behaviour by some tourists. One user wrote, ""Peak height. Zero class. It’s a “no respect, no civic sense” problem. Don’t drag an entire group for one idiot chasing attention at 13,000 ft. Altitude went up. Brain stayed at sea level.""Another commented, ""This man shows his civic sense as well as his mentality. You belong to any caste or religion but this shows in your behaviour, atiquette, posture. What do these guys want to show???""A third user said, ""Bhaii yeh toh unhi logo ke jaise hai jo Lal Qila etc jaise monuments ghumne jaane par Rahul loves Sonam likhkar aa jaate hai""","A video from Ladakh’s high-altitude Fotu La Pass sparked widespread outrage on social media.

The world’s largest beaver dam is so big that you can see it from space,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/the-worlds-largest-beaver-dam-is-so-big-that-you-can-see-it-from-space/articleshow/126520430.cms,"AI-generated

A beaver dam hidden in Canada is clearly visible from space

The actual size of the beaver dam is impressive

This beaver dam was discovered from space

Why beavers build on this scale

What the dam means for the wider park





Wood Buffalo National Park in Canada, which includes northern Alberta and parts of the Northwest Territories, is home to the largest beaver dam ever documented. The structure is located deep within the park, far from roads, towns, and established paths, making it inaccessible by foot. It is so large that it can be seen in satellite photographs from orbit. The dam is approximately 775 metres long at its front edge and spans an area of around 70,000 square metres, keeping back a substantial volume of water. It was initially discovered in 2007 using satellite imaging rather than terrestrial exploration. Further investigation revealed that the dam did not exist before 1980, implying that it was developed over several decades by multiple generations of beavers operating in the same spot.Wood Buffalo National Park spans northern Alberta and parts of the Northwest Territories. It is Canada's largest national park and among the world's largest protected places. The beaver dam is located deep within it, far from roads, cities, and recognised trails.Walking to the place would take several days. The terrain is challenging and slow. Wetlands extend over large distances. Muskeg collapses under weight.The boreal forest closes in densely. Most people who saw the dam up close did not walk there. They arrived on private sightseeing planes, looking down rather than approaching on the ground.According to Parks Canada , from end to end, the front of the dam measures roughly 775 metres. That is close to seven football fields laid side by side. The entire perimeter of the dam area approaches 2,000 metres. Its surface area covers about 70,000 square metres.The pond created behind the dam is thought to be around one metre deep. That would place the volume of water at roughly 70,000 cubic metres. Another way to see it is through scale. A standard dump truck carries about 10 cubic yards. By that measure, the dam holds back the equivalent of more than 90,000 dump trucks of water. Seen as ice, it would fill around 1,600 hockey rinks.According to BBC Wildlife , no explorer stumbled across this dam by chance. No ranger logged it during patrol. It was first noticed in 2007, not on the ground, but in satellite imagery. The structure was large enough to be visible from space.Further images, including those provided by NASA, showed that the dam did not exist before 1980. That suggests it could be up to 45 years old. Over that time, it grew slowly, piece by piece, shaped by water flow and repeated work rather than a single effort. The location helped keep it hidden. With no nearby access routes, there was little reason for people to pass through.Beavers are often described as ecosystem engineers. They change landscapes by design, even if that design follows instinct rather than a plan. By felling trees and packing wood, mud, stones, and vegetation together, they redirect water and create ponds.In the case of this dam, multiple generations of beavers worked on the same structure. Each added material where it was needed. Over time, the dam expanded and strengthened, holding back runoff from the Birch Mountains at the southern edge of the park. The result is not just a barrier but an entire water system shaped by animals rather than machines.Wood Buffalo National Park is known for more than its size. It supports wood bison, whooping cranes, and the Peace Athabasca Delta, one of the largest inland freshwater deltas in the world. The beaver dam fits quietly into that setting.It supports wetlands, slows water movement, and creates habitat for other species. It does not draw crowds or require fences. It simply exists, doing its work out of sight. Even now, most people will never see it directly. The dam remains where it was built, surrounded by forest and water, changing its corner of the park a little at a time.","The beaver dam is located in Wood Buffalo National Park in Canada.

“Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work”

Who was Thomas Alva Edison



What this Thomas Edison quote means



“Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work.”

Why this quote still matters



How people relate to it today







People remember Thomas A. Edison as one of the most important inventors. He worked on a lot of ideas and had thousands of patents over the course of his life. Many of his inventions are now a part of daily life, like the electric light bulb and sound recording devices. But Edison was known for more than just what he made. People also knew how he thought about work, hard work, and success., is one of the most popular things he has said. Edison talks about a simple habit that a lot of people have. People often look for opportunities in things that seem fun, easy, or rewarding right away. It's easier to ignore something when it looks hard or requires a lot of work. Edison thought this was where a lot of people went wrong. He says that opportunities don't usually come in a polished or attractive way. Instead, it often comes in a quiet way that looks like work that needs to be done.Thomas Alva Edison was born in 1847 in the US. He was curious about how things worked from a young age. As he got older, this curiosity turned into a habit of trying new things and making old ones better. Edison worked on many projects at once and thought that progress came from working hard over and over again instead of getting quick results.Some of the most important things he invented were the electric light bulb, phonograph, and the motion picture camera. He also built labs where groups of people could work together on long-term experiments. Edison thought that being patient, testing things out, and working hard every day were all important parts of coming up with new ideas. A lot of historical records say that he saw innovation as a normal part of his job, not a flash of genius.Edison said,He was using a simple picture to explain a common reaction. Overalls are clothes that people wear to do physical or practical work. Edison used this picture to show that opportunities often seem normal and hard to get.A lot of people think that success will come quickly or with little work. They might want results right away, without having to learn, practice, or fail along the way. Edison said that real opportunities usually require work first and pay off later. Because of this, people sometimes miss out on chances that could have helped them grow.This idea is still important because it shows how people make choices every day. Students might not want to study subjects that need more practice. Workers might not want to do tasks that seem hard. People may put off their personal goals if they seem hard or uncertain. Edison's words remind readers that trying hard doesn't mean you've failed; it usually means that something important is possible.The quote tells people to think about work in a new way. Instead of viewing work as a hindrance, it proposes perceiving it as an integral component of the opportunity.This quote is often used in classrooms, offices, and talks about how to grow as a person. Teachers use it to show how important it is to be consistent. Employers share it to show that hard work pays off in the long run. People think about it when they are deciding whether or not to take on tasks that need a lot of patience.Edison's words still ring true because they describe a reality that many people know. At first, opportunities may not seem appealing, but those who are willing to put in the work often reap the benefits in the end.","Thomas Alva Edison was one of the most important inventors of the 20th century.

The finer pollutant that tends to irritate the eyes and throat and can trigger breathing discomfort, especially for children, older adults, and anyone with asthma.

PM10 adds to dust-related irritation, often felt during commutes and in construction-heavy stretches.

The article clarifies that pollution will not be washed out by rain.

This suggests that conditions may feel improved away from areas of high congestion, even if the baseline remains elevated.

Health and Safety Recommendations

Week Ahead Forecast

These days are described as the easiest bets—dry, warm, and comparatively predictable.







Chennai is poised for a bright, sunny, and largely uneventful weather day on Thursday, January 22, 2026, with temperatures anticipated to climb into the late 20s and no significant risk of rain throughout the day. However, air quality remains a point of attention, as yesterday's readings placed it in the ""poor"" category, a condition that may persist today, particularly in areas with heavy traffic and during the calmer early morning hours. Looking ahead, the city can expect a predominantly stable week of warm days and mild nights, though Saturday presents a notable exception with a higher chance of rain.The city is set for sunny skies, with temperatures expected to reach a maximum of 27.7°C and a minimum of 19.9°C. This range is projected to keep the day warm without reaching extreme levels. The average humidity for the day is approximately 62%, indicating that the sun's intensity will be noticeable by late morning. Despite this, conditions are not expected to become uncomfortably muggy. Winds are forecast to pick up to about 22.7 km/h, providing air movement that contributes to comfort and aids in dispersing near-ground pollution.Rain is not anticipated for the day, with 0 mm precipitation recorded and a 0% chance of rain. This allows for planning outdoor activities, errands, and commutes without concern for precipitation. Clear skies are expected to lead to a more pronounced increase in warmth after mid-morning. By the afternoon, seeking shaded areas and maintaining hydration will be more crucial than carrying an umbrella. As evening approaches, the combination of diminishing sunlight and a consistent breeze is expected to create more comfortable outdoor conditions.For those planning their daily schedule, sunrise is at 6:36 AM, and sunset is at 6:06 PM. This provides a substantial period of daylight suitable for various activities, including school runs, site visits, and late-afternoon exercise. Additionally, tonight marks a Waxing Crescent moon phase, with moonrise occurring at 9:01 AM.Air quality on Wednesday, January 21, in Chennai was recorded with an AQI (India) of 161. This measurement falls into the ""poor"" category. The corresponding US AQI equivalent was 159, which also indicates air that is considered unhealthy for sensitive groups.The primary contributors to the elevated air pollution were particulate pollutants. PM2.5 levels were measured at 78, and PM10 levels reached 98, with carbon monoxide (CO) recorded at 490.With the day remaining dry and sunny, there will be no natural cleansing effect from rain.However, the moderate winds are expected to assist in dispersing localized pockets of poor air.Individuals spending time outdoors during the midday hours are advised to take precautions. Sunglasses and water are your best friends. This advice is given because sunny skies and peak temperatures between 27°C and 28°C can lead to dehydration more rapidly than anticipated.For commuters, particularly those traveling on arterial roads, wearing a well-fitted mask is recommended. This can help reduce exposure to particulate matter, which was at high levels yesterday. When planning long outdoor workouts, it is advisable to schedule them for early morning or after sunset. These times typically offer reduced heat stress. It is also suggested to choose routes away from idling traffic to minimize the intake of pollutants.The broader weather pattern for the upcoming week is expected to remain largely consistent. This includes warm days, mild nights, and abundant sunshine. Friday, January 23, is forecast to be sunny, with temperatures reaching 28.5°C for the maximum and 20.2°C for the minimum, accompanied by only a trace amount of rain at 0.09 mm.A specific weather alert is noted for Saturday, January 24. The forecast indicates a shift to patchy rain in nearby areas and a significant 89% chance of rain, with temperatures ranging from 28.1°C to 22.4°C. The article advises to keep a compact umbrella handy and expect brief wet spells rather than an all-day washout.From Sunday, January 25, through Wednesday, January 28, Chennai is projected to experience a period of partly cloudy to sunny weather. High temperatures during this stretch are expected to hover around 29°C, with nighttime temperatures in the 22–23°C range. For those planning outdoor gatherings or sports activities, Sunday or Monday are highlighted as the most favorable days.The data referenced in this article is sourced from AQI.in.","Chennai is poised for a bright, sunny, and largely uneventful weather day on Thursday, January 22, 2026.

Artificial intelligence is no longer something people only argue about in tech conferences or future forecasts. It is already quietly shaping daily life in profound and often unexpected ways. From customer support chats to recommendation engines, from coding tools to medical research, AI is now part of how work gets done efficiently. And according to Bill Gates , the pace of change is about to speed up even more dramatically.In his latest annual letter, The Year Ahead, the Microsoft co-founder lays out a clear message. AI will reshape society, economies, and jobs faster than most people expect. Gates says he remains optimistic about technology, but this time his optimism comes with serious warnings. The benefits are real. So are the risks. And ignoring either would be a grave mistake.Gates has spent decades watching technology alter economies and daily life. In his letter, he says AI is different from past waves of innovation. Not just faster, but broader. He argues that artificial intelligence could affect more parts of society than any previous human-made tool.He points to progress already happening. AI is accelerating disease research, improving climate modelling, and expanding access to digital education.Tasks that once took years can now be completed in months, sometimes weeks. For Gates, this is proof that AI can solve hard problems if used well.But he also stresses that hope alone is not a strategy. Institutions, governments, and workers are not fully prepared for how quickly these changes are arriving. Without planning, the speed of AI adoption could leave many people behind.One of Gates’ biggest concerns is how AI could be misused. As advanced tools become more accessible, the barrier to harmful use drops. He has warned that open-source AI systems could be exploited by bad actors, including non-state groups.In particular, Gates has raised alarms about biological threats. He suggests that AI-assisted misuse could pose risks even greater than naturally occurring pandemics. That is not a casual statement. It reflects a growing fear among researchers that powerful tools, in the wrong hands, could scale harm faster than ever before.Gates argues that global cooperation is essential. Clear rules, oversight, and governance structures are needed. At the same time, he acknowledges the tension. Too many restrictions could slow beneficial innovation. Too little could invite danger. Finding the balance will not be easy.Jobs sit at the centre of Gates’ warning. He says AI makes it possible to produce more goods and services with less human labour. That reality will change how companies hire and how work is valued.Some of this is already visible. In software development, AI tools help programmers write, test, and maintain code faster. Gates notes that developers can now be significantly more productive, which lowers costs and reshapes team structures.He also points to sectors like warehouse operations and phone-based customer service. As AI systems improve, these roles are likely to face pressure. Automation will not arrive all at once, but it will arrive steadily.Gates does not frame this as doom. He frames it as a disruption that needs preparation.Beyond job losses, Bill Gates talks about how work itself might change. If AI boosts productivity enough, shorter workweeks could become possible. The same output, fewer hours. It sounds appealing. But he is careful not to present it as automatic.Whether these gains benefit most people depends on policy choices. Who owns the productivity gains. How companies share them. Without thoughtful decisions, Gates warns that efficiency could concentrate wealth instead of spreading it.This is where governments and institutions matter. AI alone will not deliver fairness. People have to decide what to do with the gains it creates.","Bill Gates says AI will reshape society, economies, and jobs faster than most people expect.

Grok AI restricts image editing features to paid X users

Elon Musk warns, ‘Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will …’





Grok the AI chatbot of Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence firm xAI will no longer be able to generate sexualised or revealing images of real people. The company took this decision after the mounting criticism and regulatory scrutiny. In a post blog post share on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), the company company confirmed that it has implemented technological measures in to order to prevent Grok account from allowing the editing of images of real people. This move of the company comes after Grok users were exploiting the tool to create AI deepfakes of women and minors, undressing them in manipulated images.California Attorney General Rob Bonta revealed he had launched an investigation into Grok’s role in producing sexualized deepfakes, citing a flood of complaints in recent weeks. Meanwhile, Indonesia and Malaysia suspended Grok entirely, becoming the first countries to ban the tool. Lawmakers in the UK have also publicly considered a suspension.In a statement posted on X’s safety account the company wrote:Recently, Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok, integrated into his social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), has now announced that its image generation and editing tools will now be restricted to paying subscribers. Image generation and editing are currently limited to paying subscribers. You can subscribe to unlock these features,” Grok posted late January 8, linking to X’s premium membership page.Elon Musk said that anyone using AI chatbot Grok to make illegal content on his platform X (formerly known as Twitter) will be punished. Musk’s comments came after the chatbot – hardwired into X came under fire for producing obscene/ non-consensual images, including women and children. In an online post, the tech billionaire wrote “Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content”. The Tesla CEO was responding to a post on “inappropriate images” generated by grok.DogeDesigner, followed by Elon Musk wrote in the post: “Some people are saying Grok is creating inappropriate images. But that’s like blaming a pen for writing something bad. A pen doesn’t decide what gets written. The person holding it does. Grok works the same way. What you get depends a lot on what you put in.

All is not well between Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Meta's highest-paid employee as the company's new reporting structure shows,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/all-is-not-well-between-meta-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-and-metas-highest-paid-employee-as-the-companys-new-reporting-structure-shows/articleshow/126526041.cms,"Meta's new reporting structure reveals friction between Mark Zuckerberg and Alexandr Wang, his $14 billion hire. Wang finds Zuckerberg's micromanagement suffocating, while staff question his leadership of Meta's AI ambitions. A recent restructuring centralizes infrastructure decisions above Wang, indicating Zuckerberg's desire for tighter control over the company's significant AI investments.

Wang's inexperience becomes liability for Mark Zuckerberg as AI race intensifies

Meta reorganizes infrastructure chain of command above Wang





Meta's newest reporting structure is exposing something leadership has tried to hide—friction between CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his highest-paid employee, Alexandr Wang. Multiple sources close to the company reveal that Wang, the 28-year-old founder Zuckerberg recruited for $14 billion, finds the CEO's hands-on management suffocating. At the same time, current staff question whether Wang has the chops to lead Meta's $600 billion AI bet.The tension surfaced this fall during a crucial meeting. Wang's TBD Lab team and longtime executives Chris Cox and Andrew Bosworth clashed over strategy. Cox and Bosworth wanted Wang's new AI model trained on Instagram and Facebook data to boost the company's core advertising business. Wang pushed back hard. He argued the goal should be catching up to OpenAI and Google's models first, worrying that customizing training for product tasks would slow progress.It's an us-versus-them mentality that's become impossible to ignore inside Meta. Wang's researchers view the old guard as mere product managers stuck in the social media era. They're chasing superintelligence while everyone else cares about feeds and ads. Some staff even questioned whether $2 billion was quietly shifted from Bosworth's Reality Labs budget to Wang's team—though Meta's spokesperson denied the figure, the whispers persist.The cracks widened when Yann LeCun, Meta's legendary AI scientist and a Turing Award winner, bolted in November rather than report to Wang. Sources say LeCun bristled at serving under someone whose background was data labeling, not cutting-edge AI research. Before that, Nat Friedman, another big hire, faced pressure to move faster. The rushed launch of Vibes, Meta's AI video feed, frustrated his team who felt forced to compete with OpenAI's Sora before they were ready.Wang told associates that Zuckerberg's micromanagement feels suffocating. Yet here's the irony—Zuckerberg hired him specifically because he needed someone he could control, someone young and ambitious enough to execute his vision of ""personal superintelligence."" The CEO's reputation for obsessing over chosen projects means TBD Lab gets his undivided attention.

Q: What are some examples of career cushioning?

Q: Is career cushioning only for people in certain industries?

Q: How often should I review and update my career cushioning efforts?

Q: How do I know if my career cushioning efforts are working?

Q: How much time should I be dedicating to career cushioning?

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Aadhaar enters US SSN debate: Far-right political writer Curtis Yarvin sparks backlash with anti-India slur,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/aadhaar-enters-us-ssn-debate-far-right-political-writer-curtis-yarvin-sparks-backlash-with-anti-india-slur/articleshow/127048426.cms,"What Yarvin posted and why it sparked outrage



Why Aadhaar lands in US identity debates

What’s wrong with SSNs and why it matters now





Far-right political writer Curtis Yarvin has triggered backlash online after pulling India’s Aadhaar biometric identity system into a debate about the weaknesses of the US Social Security Number (SSN). Yarvin quote-posted a thread praising Aadhaar’s fingerprint-and-iris-based verification model as a stronger way to link identity to a real person, but his comment drew condemnation for using an anti-India slur and mocking language. The exchange quickly became a flashpoint in a growing conversation about how outdated identity systems leave economies exposed to fraud, even as modern biometric tools become more widely discussed.Yarvin was responding to a post that argued the US should move beyond SSNs as the default identity backbone. The message he quote-posted read:“It’s strange that SSN is not linked to physical person with a biometric. It should be like your own physical key that works only for you and for no one else.India built iris+fingerprint system for national ID. Good foundational service for many things.”The point of the post was to praise Aadhaar as a scalable identity layer, and to suggest the US could modernise its own system by adopting a stronger “proof-of-person” model.Yarvin’s reply, however, became the headline for the wrong reason. Instead of sticking to a policy critique, he used racist meme-style wording aimed at Indians, which many saw as a cheap insult dressed up as commentary.Curtis Yarvin is a polarising American writer and software developer, best known for his earlier blogging under the pseudonym “Mencius Moldbug”. He is widely associated with neo-reactionary politics and has built a following by attacking democratic institutions, what he calls entrenched bureaucratic power, and the wider liberal political order in the US. He has also been repeatedly criticised for flirting with racist and extremist-adjacent ideas, and for promoting a worldview that rejects egalitarianism.Yarvin does not believe modern democracy is a legitimate or functional system. Instead, he argues in favour of a more centralised, authoritarian-style model of governance, where power is concentrated under a single executive who can “run the state” more like a company and override what he views as bureaucratic paralysis. His online style is deliberately provocative, mixing internet slang with arguments about state capacity and institutional collapse.Aadhaar is India’s biometric identity programme built around fingerprints and iris scans, designed to verify identity at a national scale. Supporters describe it as a foundational digital infrastructure system because it allows identity verification to work more reliably across services.In the context of the US debate, Aadhaar is often referenced as proof that a large country can implement a modern identity layer tied to a real person, rather than relying on a number that can be stolen or misused.SSNs were created as an administrative identifier, not as a secure authentication tool for the internet era. Over time, they evolved into a de facto identity key used across financial services, credit, and verification systems, despite not being designed for that role.That mismatch has long fuelled concerns about identity theft and fraud, particularly as personal data breaches and synthetic identity scams become more common. Critics argue the US needs a stronger identity framework that can prove a person is real and present, not just in possession of a leaked number.",Far-right political writer Curtis Yarvin has triggered backlash online after pulling India’s biometric identity system into a debate about the weaknesses of the US Social Security Number (SSN) Yarvin quote-posted a thread praising the fingerprint-and-iris-based verification model as a stronger way to link identity to a real person.

Why hundreds of bald eagles are flocking to northern British Columbia’s frozen mountains during winter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/why-hundreds-of-bald-eagles-are-flocking-to-northern-british-columbias-frozen-mountains-during-winter/articleshow/126672217.cms,"Source: X

Why British Columbia’s winter landscapes draw bald eagles together



Bald eagles and rare winter group behaviour



What winter eagle gatherings reveal to scientists







In the frozen mountains of northern British Columbia, there was the unusual occurrence of a rare incident in the wildlife scene where the bald eagles were gathered in their hundreds in one spot, and in the middle of winter. Against the background of mountains laden with snow and the icy river valley, the sight was quite outstanding and unusual. For bald eagles, which stand out in their status as symbols of freedom, power, and dominance in nature, it was highly unusual for them to congregate in such huge numbers because they were predominantly lone animals and territorial in their behaviour patterns. The severity of the weather seemed to have had a huge effect on the eagles, as only limited spaces were available and where their feeds were still accessible, forcing unprecedented gatherings that stunned researchers and local communities alike. Such rare congregations offer scientists valuable insight into how climate stress reshapes wildlife behaviour and survival strategies.The northern area of British Columbia is important to the wintering survival of bald eagles. Though much of this area will freeze, there will always be fast-moving rivers that are partially open, providing the eagles with readily available fish. Rivers that support salmon are usually connected, forming pathways to life-sustaining riverways.As winter approaches and the temperature cools, bald eagles from an increasingly vast area will migrate to these feeding grounds, and many will be seen in one small area.The harsh environment imposed by winter causes a shift in bald eagles' normal habits. The immobility brought by snow, the uninhabitability of lakes due to ice, and the shorter daylight hours make energy conservation essential. The habit of securing territories disappears, with eagles seeking locations close to food sources. The movement of prey through the snow-covered environment is predictable, helping the eagles modify their hunting patterns. What seems like a rare concentration of birds is, in actual fact, a decision based on survival that is influenced by the environment.In areas outside breeding colonies or feeding grounds, however, bald eagles tend to be alone. Adults do not compete with each other, particularly around feeding areas. To witness so many of them assemble at one place is a clear indication that their social norms have been temporarily overlooked. Experts say that it is possible only in areas where food is plentiful and accessible. In such areas, even though competition may be a disadvantage, it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to observe their flexibility in handling their socialisation.The group behaviours exhibited during winter are very advantageous in several ways. The eagles can view each other in search of food, thus saving time looking for it in the frozen land. Additionally, the dominant eagles will either jump over the ice or find a source of food first as an indirect means of providing for the rest of the group members. The younger and weaker eagles are able to get protection by staying in a group, thus minimising the chances of starvation.Large winter gatherings offer a unique opportunity to study bald eagles under environmental stress. Scientists are able to estimate population size, age structure, feeding patterns, and social tolerance. It helps them to get an idea about the resiliency of the species towards extreme weather and habitat pressure. This kind of data is very crucial in view of changing climatic cycles that disturb food availability and migration behaviour in an ecosystem.The sight of hundreds of eagles in one place often plays the role of a sign of ecological vigour: healthy fish populations, undisrupted waterways, and preserved forest habitats. These aggregations are the natural barometers by which environmental health is spotlighted, emphasising those areas where ecosystems are healthy and working.","The sight of hundreds of bald eagles in one place in British Columbia stunned researchers and local communities.

"Abu Dhabi Dar​b toll scam alert: Fraudsters sending fake pending fees messages, what UAE residents must know",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/abu-dhabi-darb-toll-scam-alert-fraudsters-sending-fake-pending-fees-messages-what-uae-residents-must-know/articleshow/126978446.cms,"UAE Darb Toll Scam Alert: Drivers Warned of Fake SMS Messages

What are UAE drivers seeing? Fake “DARB alerts”



A supposed payment link with a web URL that looks official at first glance

A prompt to “Reply Y” to open a payment portal

A claimed overdue toll amount

The sender phone number was not from a UAE mobile network

The links did not use official government or Q Mobility domains

Recipients often reported they had no actual pending tolls

Official advice: Trust only Q Mobility’s approved channels



The official DARB App

The Darb website: darb.qmobility.ae

Approved government platforms such as TAMM

Any message that arrives from a random phone number, especially from an international code, should be treated as suspicious.

Why this UAE toll scam is on the rise



كن حذراً من رسائل الاحتيال التي تدّعي أنها من كيو موبيليتي

تأكد دائماً من أن الرابط في الرسالة النصية صحيح وأن الرسالة مرسلة من الحساب الرسمي ""كيو موبيليتي"".

ويتمّ الدفع فقط عبر القنوات الرسمية: تطبيق تم أو درب أو الموقع الإلكترونيhttps://t.co/X9qeDV8n0u pic.twitter.com/lOSXVKihUe— Q Mobility (@qmobilityuae) January 21, 2026

How the Darb toll system really works in the UAE



You must register your vehicle with the Darb toll management system to receive legitimate alerts about unpaid tolls or fines.

Registered vehicles are monitored automatically; toll charges are debited from your account or wallet within the official app or platform.

Official Darb alerts always appear via the app or authorised government SMS services, not from foreign or unrecognised numbers.

Tips to protect yourself from toll scams



Ignore Unknown Toll Alerts - If the toll message comes from an unfamiliar number or contains an unusual link, do not click it, even if the amount looks small. Check Your Payments Directly - Open the Darb app or visit the official website to see if there are legitimate pending charges or fines. Don’t Reply to Suspicious Messages - Responding to scam texts, even with “Y” as instructed, can trigger further scam activity or lead to phishing. Report Scam Messages - Forward the suspicious message to your carrier or mark it as spam; consider notifying local authorities or Q Mobility support. Learn Scam Signs - Scammers often use international numbers, grammar errors, URLs that resemble official domains but differ slightly, and urgent language warning of fines.

Fake Messages Sent by Darb Toll Scammers





Motorists across the UAE, especially in Abu Dhabi, have been warned about fraudulent messages lurking in text inboxes that claim to be official Darb toll alerts. These scam notifications say that drivers have pending Darb toll fees and urge them to click on a link or reply “Y” to settle fines quickly. However, authorities say that these are fake messages designed to trick people into clicking malicious links and potentially giving up personal or payment information.Prompted by a spike in user reports and online complaints, transport officials and cybersecurity experts are now sounding the alarm for drivers to remain vigilant and only use authorised government channels to check toll violations or make payments.In recent days, several UAE residents reported receiving SMS messages titled “DARB-Alert” claiming there are pending toll fees, often just a few dirhams and warning that a fine (typically Dh100) and points could be imposed if the fee isn’t paid “today.”The messages often include:However, when investigators looked at these messages, they found red flags:Similar patterns are being discussed across social media threads, with users warning each other not to click the links.One Dubai Reddit user noted the suspicious URL included spelling errors and a non-government “.com” address, something official toll notifications would never use.Q Mobility, the operator of Abu Dhabi’s Darb toll system and part of the Abu Dhabi Developmental Holding Company (ADQ) has repeatedly warned users to verify any message claiming to be from them. According to a recent social media post from the company, the only trusted channels for toll alerts and payments are:Q Mobility stressed that official notifications clearly identify themselves and never request responses like “Reply Y.” They also do not include unofficial URLs.Cyber scams of this kind are part of a broader trend of phishing and fake alert campaigns targeting UAE residents in recent years. Authorities including Abu Dhabi Police have actively run awareness campaigns like the “Be Cautious” initiative to educate the public about online fraud tactics, from deceptive links to phishing phone calls.These scam messages exploit urgency and fear, suggesting fines or legal penalties, to trick people into acting impulsively. That’s a common tactic in digital fraud, and law enforcement agencies caution against clicking unfamiliar links or providing sensitive personal or financial data.Similar warnings have been issued about traffic fine phishing emails in the UAE, where fraudsters use fake police logos and official-looking layouts to dupe people into clicking links to bogus payment pages.Understanding how the toll system functions sheds light on why you should not trust random messages:If you suspect you genuinely owe a toll payment, you should open the Darb app or log in to darb.qmobility.ae directly, not via a link in a text message.Here’s how residents are being advised to stay safe:With digital payments and e-services becoming the norm for tolls, parking and traffic fines, scams that mimic these systems can cause real harm, from financial loss to identity theft. Authorities across the UAE have consistently advised residents to verify all digital communications before acting.Abu Dhabi’s integrated transport technology continues to evolve, including paid parking integration through the Darb app and new traffic regulations to improve road flow and compliance. But the convenience of these services also attracts fraudsters looking to exploit public trust.Staying informed and cautious is essential to avoiding scams and ensuring that digital traffic services work as intended.",UAE drivers warned about fraudulent messages claiming to be official Darb toll alerts.

Special medical considerations for Ramadan 2026



Bottom line: Opt for a balanced, informed approach this Ramadan 2026







As Ramadan 2026 nears, millions around the world are preparing not only spiritually but physically for a month of dawn-to-sunset fasting. While fasting is a beloved religious observance, health experts emphasise that preparation and smart nutrition are crucial to maintaining wellbeing throughout the month. Combining insights from local doctors and reputable global health organisations, here is a trusted guide to help you fast safely and comfortably.Adequate hydration is one of the most important components of a successful fast. The World Health Organization (WHO) Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office specifically recommends drinking plenty of water (at least around 10 glasses) and eating hydrating foods such as soups and fresh fruits like watermelon and salads during non-fasting hours to compensate for fluids lost during the day. They also advise avoiding caffeinated drinks such as coffee, tea and cola because caffeine increases urination and can lead to dehydration.Cornell Health, the health and wellbeing service of Cornell University, echoes this and adds that one should drink fluids at regular intervals through the night and avoid consuming too much at once, as over-hydration in one go can dilute electrolytes.Skipping the pre-dawn meal (suhoor) can make fasting significantly harder.Nutrition experts from Cornell Health advise that suhoor should include a mix of whole grains, protein, healthy fats and fruits or vegetables to help sustain energy and keep blood sugar stable throughout the long fast. Examples include whole-grain cereals or toast with eggs, yogurt with fruit and nuts, or brown rice with vegetables.The WHO also recommends that suhoor be light but nutritious, particularly for groups who may be more vulnerable during fasting such as elderly adults, adolescents, pregnant or nursing women.Both WHO and international dietary guides emphasise the benefits of starting iftar (the evening meal that breaks the fast) with water and dates, a longstanding tradition rooted in health as well as faith. Dates provide natural sugars and a small energy boost while water immediately begins rehydrating the body after prolonged abstinence.This approach is supported by general Ramadan nutrition advice from organisations such as Fraser Health in Canada, which notes that dates and low-fat milk are a healthy way to break the fast and can help prevent abrupt blood sugar fluctuations that contribute to fatigue.Healthline, a respected medical and nutrition information site, recommends leaning into whole foods rich in fiber, lean proteins and healthy carbohydrates during iftar to replenish nutrients lost during the day and provide lasting energy through the night and into the next fast. Examples include vegetables, whole grains, lean meats, eggs, legumes and dairy.Their registered dietitians also emphasise moderation, eating mindfully at iftar and avoiding heavy, sugary, or high-fat foods that can cause indigestion and fatigue. Starting with water and a small date or fruit before main dishes helps control appetite and prevent overeating.Several health authorities recommend reducing caffeine intake in the week leading up to Ramadan. Research and expert advice from wellness organisations suggest that sudden withdrawal from habitual caffeine can lead to headaches and fatigue, symptoms many people misattribute to fasting itself. Gradually tapering coffee and tea before Ramadan can help your body avoid these issues once fasting begins.Moreover, WHO guidance clearly states avoiding caffeine during suhoor and non-fasting periods because it increases urine output and can exacerbate dehydration, something you want to minimise before long fasting hours.WHO and other health organisations encourage a balanced diet throughout Ramadan, composed of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins and sufficient fluids, while limiting deep-fried, processed or high-sugar foods that contribute little nutrition and can lead to discomfort or weight gain.This aligns with Cornell Health’s advice on maintaining good nutrition: including vegetables, whole grains and healthy proteins at both suhoor and iftar to help manage hunger, energy levels, and overall health during the fast.While Ramadan is not usually a time for intense workouts during fasting hours, light movement and gentle exercise in the evening, such as walking or stretching, can support digestion and circulation, according to health advisors. Framing this within a balanced lifestyle helps preserve energy without risking dehydration or exhaustion.Sleep hygiene is also important because altered timetables can disrupt normal sleep cycles during Ramadan. Experts advise aiming for adequate rest (7–8 hours if possible) by incorporating naps and consistent sleeping schedules into your routine, which supports physical recovery throughout the fasting month.International health bodies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and dietetics professionals often emphasise that people with chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart disease or those on specific medications should consult a healthcare provider before fasting. Adjustments to meal timing, medication schedules and monitoring plans ensure safety and prevent complications.This is particularly relevant for individuals whose medical treatments require food or water intake at specific times and cannot be adjusted without professional supervision.Preparing your body for Ramadan fasting is not just about abstaining from food and drink during daylight hours. It is about planning smartly, hydrating fully, eating nutrient-dense meals and respecting your body’s needs. Strategies backed by the World Health Organization, Cornell Health and other recognised health authorities affirm that with proper preparation, most people can experience a safe, comfortable and fulfilling Ramadan.By following these evidence-based tips, from hydration and meal composition to rest and medical consultation, you can approach the holy month with both spiritual intention and physical wellbeing.",Ramadan 2026: Are You Ready to Fast Safely?

Check around you before stepping out: Look under seats and door pockets.

Dubai’s Lost & Found: A model for smart cities







Dubai’s famous taxis are not just fast and reliable, they are also a magnet for forgotten belongings. According to the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA), passengers left behind a staggering 104,162 items in taxis across the Emirate during 2025, prompting one of the city’s busiest Lost & Found seasons on record as drivers and the RTA worked to reunite commuters with their lost property.From wallets stuffed with cash to passports and gadgets, the range of forgotten items reflects the hustle of everyday life in Dubai and the efficiency of a system designed to ensure that lost does not have to mean gone forever. Here’s a closer look at what riders forgot most and how Dubai’s smart mobility network brought them back.The lost and found numbers from RTA reveal that Dubai riders were not just leaving behind the occasional umbrella or pair of sunglasses, they were dropping valuable and essential items after rides. Over AED 2 million in cash was handed into the Lost & Found team in 2025, alongside a flood of high-tech devices and personal documents.Here’s a snapshot of what riders left behind:These figures highlight just how often commuters hustle out of taxis without double-checking pockets, bags or seat areas, perhaps rushed by work, social plans or caregiving duties. The sheer volume also underscores the importance of Dubai’s lost-item recovery infrastructure.The Dubai RTA did not just log these reports; it made getting items back surprisingly smooth for riders. RTA’s system is built around swift communication, detailed tracking and cooperation between call center teams, drivers and taxi companies, often resulting in a recovery within two hours of the initial report.Meera Al Shaikh, Director of Customer Happiness at the RTA, explained that the lost property framework strengthens trust in Dubai’s mobility ecosystem, raising satisfaction not just for journeys but for what passengers take with them afterward.The reporting process itself is multilingual and highly accessible. Passengers can report lost items through:Services are offered in Arabic, English, Hindi, Filipino, French, Chinese, Russian and more, reflecting Dubai’s highly diverse population and making it easy for tourists, residents and workers alike to submit a lost item claim with minimal friction.Being distracted, juggling bags or stepping out in a hurry are everyday occurrences but in a city like Dubai, where taxi trips can be short and frequent, these moments add up to a significant number of forgotten belongings. Unlike many other global cities where lost items may never be reunited with their owners, Dubai’s approach has become a benchmark for urban mobility services.However, it is not just about numbers. The system empowers riders to reclaim valuables quickly and securely. Identity verification protects passengers’ privacy and integrated tracking technologies ensure swift communication with drivers once an item is reported.The RTA’s Lost & Found team reported over 30 messages of gratitude from riders in 2025 alone, a small but telling indicator of how these efforts improve everyday life for commuters across the city.Even with an efficient recovery system in place, prevention is always better than reclamation. Common taxi riders in Dubai and beyond often leave behind items like smartphones, wallets and keys simply because they’re thinking about their next stop. Research from ride-hailing lost property indexes elsewhere suggests items like glasses, bags and even wedding rings sometimes get left behind when commuters rush between meetings or errands.Here are practical tips to reduce that “oops” moment:What if something does get left behind? Filing a report via the RTA call centre or app quickly is the best way to get that item back while the taxi is still nearby.Dubai’s experience with lost items in taxis is not just about forgetfulness, it is a testament to how smart city infrastructure, responsive government services and community cooperation can turn everyday problems into positive outcomes. Where some cities struggle to reunite lost property with owners, Dubai’s integrated approach, supported by multicultural service channels and tech-enabled systems, sets a high bar.Indeed, the success of the lost property framework complements other facets of Dubai’s transportation vision, which includes expanding digital taxi fleets and enhancing connectivity for residents and visitors alike. Whether it is reconnecting a commuter with their passport or returning a laptop they thought was long gone, Dubai’s taxi Lost & Found system is proving that a seamless urban experience includes confidence that what you leave behind can often be found again, fast, safe and with a smile.","Dubai riders left behind 104,162 items in taxis during 2025, prompting one of the city’s busiest Lost & Found seasons on record.

Dubai issues warning over illegal parking deals in Discovery Gardens,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/dubai-issues-warning-over-illegal-parking-deals-in-discovery-gardens/articleshow/126706296.cms,"Discovery Gardens introduces paid parking in Dubai, warns residents against unofficial rentals / Image: file

Official warning

Permit rules and fees

Delays and app challenges





Dubai’s Discovery Gardens community has introduced a regulated paid parking system aimed at managing the growing number of vehicles and reducing congestion. This change, effective from January 15, 2026, makes on-street parking a paid service, with licence zone signs now in place across the neighbourhood. Residents must apply for parking permits through the official Parkonic system rather than relying on informal arrangements.Each residential unit in buildings without dedicated parking receives one free permit for a vehicle. Additional cars require a paid subscription, typically Dh945 per month or Dh2,625 quarterly, as part of the effort to ensure fair usage and open up street spaces for legitimate residents.In response to posts on community social media pages offering private parking spaces for rent, Parkonic has cautioned residents against unofficial deals. These offers, circulating on platforms like Facebook, involve tenants advertising outdoor parking spaces in exchange for monthly fees.Parkonic emphasised that all valid parking permits can only be obtained through its official app or authorised channels.Payments and registrations made outside the recognised platforms are not supported, and vehicles using such informal arrangements may face regular visitor parking charges or be considered unauthorised, potentially leading to fines or penalties.This advisory aims to protect residents from possible scams and confusion, and to ensure all parking entitlements remain traceable and enforceable under Dubai community rules.The new parking rules have sparked mixed reactions among tenants across the community. Some argue that the fees for second vehicles are too high, especially for families with more than one car, calling for reductions to Dh500-Dh600 or other concessions to ease the burden.There have also been specific concerns from residents of the Zen Cluster (Pink Buildings), a part of Discovery Gardens where only certain apartments have basement parking. A recent circular clarified that on-street parking is excluded from complimentary permit eligibility if a residential unit already has basement parking access, meaning many studio tenants now face visitor tariffs instead of free permits.Residents in this cluster say the lack of free street permits unfairly penalises them and are pushing for equal treatment with tenants in other parts of the community.The transition hasn’t been without hiccups. Parkonic extended the registration deadline to January 19 after numerous residents reported difficulties using the Parkonic app, such as system errors and inability to activate permits even after receiving PINs.To address these issues, Parkonic pledged that residents will not face fines while technical problems persist and that support teams are working to resolve account and activation challenges. This temporary extension has helped more tenants complete the permit process without penalty.Overall, the introduction of paid and regulated parking in Discovery Gardens represents a broader trend in Dubai to standardise parking across communities and reduce misuse by non-residents or long-term street storage. The system aims to free up spaces, reduce traffic problems and prioritise residents, but it also highlights the need for clear communication and flexibility as lived realities catch up with policy.As implementation continues, resident feedback will likely shape future adjustments, especially around fee levels, eligibility criteria, and enforcement practices.",Dubai’s Discovery Gardens community has introduced a regulated paid parking system aimed at managing the growing number of vehicles.

Abu Dhabi rolls out blood test capable of detecting 50+ cancer types,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/abu-dhabi-rolls-out-blood-test-capable-of-detecting-50-cancer-types/articleshow/126670898.cms,"Abu Dhabi’s new blood test makes cancer screening as simple as a lab draw / AI Illustration

How do blood tests detect cancer?

The rollout

Age and Risk: The test is primarily aimed at residents aged 40 and above. It is particularly recommended for those with a family history of cancer or those who have missed traditional screenings.



Location: You can access the test at major healthcare hubs, including facilities operated by Ambulatory Healthcare Services (AHS) and the M42 healthcare network. This covers clinics across Abu Dhabi city, Al Ain, and the Al Dhafra region.



Complimentary Use: It is important to note that this test is meant to complement traditional screenings (like papsmears or mammograms), providing an extra layer of security for cancers that don't have standard screening methods.

Cost

Why does this matter?





Abu Dhabi is once again setting a global benchmark in healthcare. The Department of Health (DoH) and the Abu Dhabi Public Health Centre (ADPHC) have officially introduced a revolutionary Multi-Cancer Early Detection (MCED) blood test.This isn't just another medical check-up; it is a sophisticated ""liquid biopsy"" that can spot the early biological fingerprints of over 50 different types of cancer from a single tube of blood.For years, the medical world has struggled to screen for ""silent killers"", cancers like those in the pancreas, liver, and brain, which often show no symptoms until it is too late.By identifying fragments of cancer DNA circulating in the bloodstream, this test provides a window into the body's health that traditional scans might miss, catching tumors when they are most treatable.The newly introduced test works by identifying cancer-related biological markers circulating in the blood. Unlike traditional screenings, which usually target one cancer at a time, this test can detect dozens of cancers in a single sample, including types that currently have no standard screening methods, such as pancreatic, gastric and certain brain cancers.From a healthcare-system perspective, this is a major accomplishment.It reduces the need for multiple invasive procedures, lowers patient hesitation around screening, and makes early detection far more accessible. The test requires no fasting, no preparation and no hospital admission, making it suitable for integration into routine health check-ups.Doctors involved in the programme have emphasised that this approach removes many of the psychological and practical barriers that prevent people from getting screened in the first place, a key reason cancers are often detected too late.The Department of Health is rolling out this technology with a specific focus on those who need it most. The service is being integrated into the existing IFHAS program, which is Abu Dhabi's comprehensive health screening initiative for residents.The test is currently priced between AED 7,000 and AED 8,000, reflecting the advanced technology behind it. While not positioned as a mass free screening yet, health experts note that detecting multiple cancers through a single test can be more cost-effective over time than multiple separate investigations and late-stage treatments.More importantly, the rollout sends a strong signal about the future direction of healthcare in the UAE, one that prioritises early intervention, data-driven diagnostics and patient-friendly solutions. As similar technologies continue to evolve globally, Abu Dhabi’s early adoption places it among regions leading the transition toward next-generation preventive medicine.This initiative is not just about a new test, it represents an institutional achievement. Abu Dhabi has demonstrated how advanced science, policy support and healthcare infrastructure can come together to address one of the world’s deadliest diseases more effectively.By making early cancer detection simpler and more accessible, the emirate has taken a decisive step toward saving lives before they reach hospital wards, a true measure of progress in modern healthcare.","Abu Dhabi has introduced a revolutionary blood test for cancer screening.

How does it work?

Shared Rides with Tech-Enabled SUVs: Instead of every family driving separately, students are grouped by neighbourhood and ride in shared, tech-equipped SUVs or buses to and from school.



Smart Routes, Same Targets: Routes are planned using demand data, grouping students headed in similar directions and aligned with school start and finish times.



Optimised Timing: RTA aims to keep ride times under 60 minutes for most trips, which is more predictable than traditional buses or variable car drop-offs.



Managed by Partners: The pilot is being run with Yango Group providing tech and booking systems, and Urban Express Transport operating the vehicles.

The traditional big yellow bus is getting a high-tech makeover. Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has officially rolled out a pilot program that lets students trade the standard bus seat for a luxury SUV. Launched in mid-January 2026, this ""pooled transport"" initiative is designed for students aged 14 and above who attend schools in high-traffic clusters.Instead of a fixed, long-winded bus route that stops at every corner, these high-end vehicles use smart data from Yango Group and Urban Express to pick up students living in the same neighborhood. By grouping children heading to nearby schools into one premium vehicle, the RTA hopes to slash the number of private cars clogging up school gates every morning.Dubai’s pooled system is a shared ride model designed to be efficient, safe and modern:Unlike traditional dedicated school buses that serve only one school, this model is zoned and demand-responsive, similar to ride-hailing, but tailored for students and safety.The initial phase of this ""neighborhood pooling"" is focused on the Al Barsha area, one of Dubai's busiest education hubs. If your child attends one of the following six schools, you are eligible to register for the service:The service isn't just about the ride; it's about the timing.The RTA guarantees that no student will spend more than 60 minutes in the vehicle, and routes are optimized daily to ensure the fastest possible trip from doorstep to classroom. Price of premiumWhile ""luxury SUV"" sounds expensive, the pooling model actually makes it surprisingly affordable. The pilot has launched with a special introductory rate of AED 1,000 per month.Compared to the cost of fuel, the time spent by a parent or driver in traffic, and traditional bus fees, the RTA estimates this model can save families about 15% in costs. Parents get the peace of mind of live vehicle tracking through a dedicated app, and the vehicles are held to the same strict safety standards as regular school buses, including smart monitoring and RTA-certified drivers.The ""SUV for students"" move is part of a larger strategy to get 60% of students into shared transport within the next three years. For the average resident, even those without school-age kids, this is a win. Fewer private cars performing U-turns and double-parking at school gates means a smoother flow for everyone during the 7:30 AM rush.Ahmed Hashem Bahrozyan, CEO of the Public Transport Agency, emphasized that the pilot is a ""step-change"" in how Dubai handles daily mobility. If the Al Barsha trial shows a significant drop in congestion, the RTA plans to expand the SUV and pooled bus service to other major school districts across Dubai by the start of the next school year in September 2026.","Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has officially rolled out a pilot program that lets students trade the standard bus seat for a luxury SUV.

Coup In Britain? Starmer’s ‘Own Cabinet Plots’ His Downfall | ‘Full Bunker Mode’ In No. 10





The 61-second video of UK PM Keir Starmer would be shocking, if it were true. ""The UK is set to introduce a nationwide curfew, beginning at 11pm each night,"" he appears to say on one of thousands of TikTok videos of him posted in last six months. ""Under the new rule, no one will be permitted to leave their home after 11pm without official authorisation.""Starmer never made any such policy or announcement. But thanks to AI, the PM in the short video sounded eerily like the real one. The fake video attracted over 430,000 views and inspired similar posts on X and Facebook. That video, and other similar ones, appears to have been taken down by the Chinese-owned social media company, which officially prohibits ""fake authoritative sources or crisis events, or falsely shows public figures in certain contexts. ""But the clip was just one of 6,042 such videos, most featuring Starmer, identified by NewsGuard, a company that tracks online misinformation, between May and Dec. In a report, it said the videos were posted by accounts with names of fake, British-sounding news organisations like ""BBB UK News"" and ""Daily Britain News."" Together, the accounts had more than 1 million followers when the report was issued. ""It consistently emulates Starmer,"" said Eva Maitland, senior analyst for Russian influence at NewsGuard.""It produces false or baseless claims that look bad for the Starmer govt, and they're kind of created to create a strong response from people so that they'll click on it.""Maitland said the videos do not appear to be part of a coordinated effort by foreign adversaries like Russia or the PM's domestic political opponents to damage him in the eyes of voters. Rather, she said, they are likely being created by content producers whose primary goal is to make money by making videos that go viral.The widespread adoption of easy-to-use AI video generation tools, like OpenAI's Sora, has dramatically increased the number of fake videos on TikTok and other social media platforms. The fake videos come at a particularly difficult time for the PM, who is already suffering from very low polling numbers. In one video, Starmer seems to announce new drivers licence laws that could strip many British people of their ability to drive legally in the country. Another video has Starmer's faked voice declaring that new rules will allow the authorities to access any British person's phone, along with its private data.In the immediate days after NewsGuard published its report on Dec 9, many of the videos were available on TikTok. By Dec 19, most appeared to have been removed from the platform. Howard said the use of AI in politics is increasing rapidly. ""We know it's internationally pervasive now,"" he said.

Ask Dhirendra: 'How do I decide how much to save and invest when my income is just about enough?',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/mutual-funds/ask-dhirendra-how-do-i-decide-how-much-to-save-and-invest-when-my-income-is-just-about-enough/articleshow/126072787.cms,"The problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save. (AI image)

“How do I decide how much to save and invest when my income is just about enough?”

What can you save today without breaking your life? How can you make that number grow every year?

Where does a typical salary go?

Some expenses are non-negotiable (rent, basic food, fees).

Some are negotiable but important (a modest phone, occasional eating out).

Some are pure leakage (unused subscriptions, impulsive orders, “I don’t even remember what this was”).

From spare change to serious money

Step up your SIP before you step up your lifestyle

First, add up your genuine essentials: rent/EMI, groceries, utilities, fees, basic transport.

Next, be realistic and add a modest amount for discretionary spending that you know you’ll do anyway – because you are human, not a robot.

See what is left. From that leftover, commit to a percentage – even 10% of your take-home income – as a non-negotiable saving and investing amount. Set up automatic transfers and SIPs for that right after your salary date.

If you have any queries for Dhirendra Kumar you can drop us an email at: toi.business@timesinternet.in

(Dhirendra Kumar is Founder and CEO of Value Research)

This is one of those questions that sounds technical, but is actually very emotional.On paper, it’s simple: income comes in, expenses go out, and whatever is left is “savings. In real life, income comes in, rent, EMIs, school fees, petrol, Swiggy, Zomato, sale on Myntra, birthday gifts, one sudden expense… and at the end of the month, you look at your balance and say, “I’ll start investing from next month. Pakka.”Next month looks surprisingly similar.So let’s start with an honest admission: for most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.At Value Research, whenever we look at this, we don’t begin with a number like “you must save 30%”. We start with a different idea: savings are not what is left after spending. Savings are what you decide first; spending adjusts after that if you flip this order, the maths – and your behaviour – changes completely.A good rule of thumb for many middle-class households is to allocate 20–30% of their take-home income to savings and investments. However, I also know that for many people today, 30% sounds like a bad joke. So instead of fighting over the “ideal” number, let’s work with two simpler questions:To answer the first question, you need to know where your money is actually going, not where you think it is going.For one or two months, track your expenses honestly – not for Instagram, for yourself. You don’t need an app; even a simple notebook or spreadsheet works.Once you see your own pie chart, three things usually stand out:Your first “investment” might simply be plugging two or three leaks. Even if that frees up only ₹2,000–₹3,000 a month, that is your starting SIP.Now let’s look at how “small” that really is.When we run these numbers at Value Research in our retirement and goal calculators, the results are always the same: the gap between zero and small is far bigger than the gap between small and perfect.But what if your income truly is at the survival stage? There are people for whom even ₹2,000 is a luxury some months. If that’s your reality, you have two parallel jobs. One is to create a tiny habit – even ₹500 or ₹1,000 a month into a recurring deposit or a conservative fund. The absolute amount is less important than the mental switch from “I’ll save if anything is left” to “I will save something, and then I will live on the rest. ”The second job is to make sure that as your income grows, your lifestyle doesn’t expand at the same speed. This is where a lot of middle-class Indians quietly sabotage themselves. Every salary increase automatically becomes a better phone, nicer meals out, upgraded gadgets, and bigger car loans. The percentage saved stays the same, or sometimes even falls.A very powerful habit – one we often build into plans at Value Research – is the “step-up”. Each year, when your salary goes up, you increase your SIPs and savings before you upgrade anything else.In many examples we’ve run, the step-up strategy leads to a dramatically higher corpus at the end, without you ever feeling an acute “sacrifice” in any single year. You just avoid letting every pay hike leak out into lifestyle.Now, how do you decide your own number?Here’s a simple approach:If that number feels tight, start a little lower and promise yourself one thing: every time your income goes up, your savings rate will go up faster than your spending.At Value Research, when we build long-term plans, we don’t assume people will suddenly start saving 40% from next month. We assume they will start somewhere realistic, and then we design step-ups. The rigour is in the process, not in some magical starting number.One last point. Many people postpone investing because they are embarrassed by how small their starting amount looks. Please don’t underestimate the psychological power of seeing a small, growing pile that you started and maintained. It changes how you think about yourself: from “I can’t save” to “I am someone who always saves something.” That identity is worth more than one extra dinner out.So how much should you save and invest when your income feels just about enough? The honest answer is: start with whatever you can without lying to yourself, protect that amount like you protect your rent, and then make sure it rises every time your income increases. The “right” number is not what a formula says; it’s the number you will actually stick to for the next 20 years.The perfect percentage can wait. The first rupee cannot.","Dhirendra Kumar: For most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.

Nominee vs legal heir: What is the difference and who has claim on assets? All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/faq/nominee-vs-legal-heir-what-is-the-difference-and-who-has-claim-on-assets-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/125130453.cms,"AI image

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Why Chris Do's principles matter now more than ever



Know who you are before asking others to know you.

Choose collaborators who elevate your voice.

Tell your story boldly, beautifully and authentically.





At Dubai’s Billion Followers Summit, the world’s biggest event for digital creators, one of the leading voices in branding and design took to the stage with a clear message that in a crowded digital world, being different is not optional but essential.Chris Do, CEO and Founder of The Futur, a global creative education platform followed by millions, shared his top principles for content creators aiming to build a distinctive identity in an era where anyone with a phone can publish content. His session titled “How to Stand Out in a Noisy World” was one of the highlights of the fourth 1 Billion Followers Summit 2026 in Dubai, an event drawing tens of thousands of creators from around the world under the theme “Content for Good. ”Do’s first principle is deceptively simple: define precisely what you want before trying to build a public persona. In his view, clarity of intent serves as a magnetic force. Once you know your destination, your work naturally aligns with opportunities and audiences. Without that clarity, creators risk mimicking others and blending into the noise.“Don't expect everyone to know you. Instead, you should focus on building a distinctive personality that people will recognise.To build this distinctive personality, there are a number of assets or principles. The first is to define precisely what you want because if you do that, you will find that life organises things for you until you achieve what you want,” Do told the packed audience.The underlying idea here is that identity precedes audience, not the other way around. When creators are consistent in what they stand for, others are far more likely to gravitate toward them, not because their content is everywhere but because it matters somewhere. This kind of intentional positioning builds both followers and loyalty.Next, Do emphasised that the creators who want to make a mark should not shy away from associating with big names in their niche. Rather than playing it safe in isolated corners of the internet, ambitious creators should actively pursue collaborations with people, brands or platforms that already embody excellence in their field.This is not about ego or branding theatrics, it is about strategic visibility. When you align yourself with recognised authorities, your own voice gains credibility by association. For many content creators, the smartest next step is not more posting; it is more worthwhile partnerships.The third and most human of Do’s principles centres on storytelling. For a creator to stand out, audiences must first know you before they engage with what you create. In a world where trends and memes come and go, a creator’s unique story becomes their lasting currency.Do urged creators to have the courage to show opinions that differ from the mainstream, even if they seem strange or unconventional. However, he also stressed that difference must be meaningful, not different for the sake of attention. Authenticity, he argued, is the glue that connects form and substance, bold ideas with beautiful presentation.If your aesthetic and your values align, people don’t just follow you; they remember you. His point reflects a wider industry shift: audiences increasingly reward truth and depth over polished mimicry.Do’s session came against the backdrop of the 1 Billion Followers Summit’s explosive growth. With over 30,000 attendees, 15,000+ creators and 500+ expert speakers from around the world, the event underscores the creator economy’s evolving complexity and influence.As traditional media models continue to shift, with millions of videos uploaded daily and users spending hours on social platforms, creators are discovering that follower counts alone no longer guarantee success. The goal is no longer only visibility but distinctive influence and lasting connection. This idea is echoed by other speakers at the summit, who have urged creators to think beyond virality and focus on purpose, responsibility and real impact in their craft.For aspiring creators and seasoned influencers alike, Do’s framework offers a roadmap out of content fatigue and into meaningful growth:These principles are not tricks or shortcuts; they are foundations for a digital identity that withstands trends and algorithm changes, transforming creators from noise makers into distinctive voices in the global conversation. In a world where anyone can become a creator overnight, enduring influence is built not by copying what’s popular but by defining what’s you. As Chris Do put it in Dubai: clarity, collaboration and courageous storytelling are not just nice to have, they are the keys to standing out in an increasingly crowded world.","Chris Do, CEO and Founder of The Futur, shared his top principles for content creators aiming to build a distinctive identity in an era where anyone with a phone can publish content.
