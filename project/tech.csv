Tesla fire claims lives of four Indians in Canada after electronic door malfunctions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/tesla-fire-claims-lives-of-four-indians-in-canada-after-electronic-door-malfunctions/articleshow/115226891.cms,"Four friends of Indian descent in Canada lost their lives in a burning Tesla after a crash that reportedly rendered the car's electronic door handles inoperable, according to the Daily Mail. The sole survivor, a woman in her 20s, was rescued from the crash on October 24 when Canada Post employee Rick Harper broke the window of the burning Tesla Model Y with a metal pole.The victims were identified as 25-year-old Neelraj Gohil, his sister Ketaba Gohil, 29, along with Jay Sisodiya and Digvijay Patel.Tesla vehicles lack traditional handles; instead, they use electronic buttons to open the doors. However, after a crash, power failures can cause these doors to jam. ""I would assume the young lady would have tried to open the door from the inside, because she was pretty desperate to get out,"" Harper was quoted as saying.'I don't know if that was the battery or what. But she couldn't get out.'Harper recounted that the woman escaped the car head-first after he broke the window. The smoke was so dense that he couldn’t see there were others still trapped inside, leaving him uncertain whether they, too, had been desperately trying to get out.Police said that the car was traveling at high speed when it struck a guardrail along Toronto's Lake Shore Boulevard East. The exact cause of the crash remains unkown yet.While Tesla promotes a ""safety-first design,"" experts point out that its manual door-release system is not widely known. This feature requires occupants to pull away a panel and tug a cable beneath it, but accident victims may be too panicked or disoriented to locate this in an emergency.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is conducting nine investigations into Tesla Model Y vehicles—the model involved in this incident—over issues such as ""unexpected brake activation"" and ""sudden unintended acceleration.""","The victims were identified as Neelraj Gohil, his sister Ketaba, 29, Jay Sisodiya and Digvijay Patel.

Knee Surgery Meme: Explaining the evolution of 'That feeling when knee surgery is tomorrow' meme,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/explaining-the-evolution-of-that-feeling-when-knee-surgery-is-tomorrow-meme/articleshow/115139251.cms,"What does the meme mean

What makes the joke intriguing

When did it originate

The ""That feeling when knee surgery is tomorrow"" meme, also known as the Blue Grinch meme , expresses a specific emotional state associated with a pending knee surgery.The meme which gained widespread popularity, traces its origins to an earlier version featuring a squirrel image.The meme finds humor in a highly specific and relatable situation, creating an instant connection for those who have experienced the anxiety of an upcoming medical procedure, specifically knee surgery.The inclusion of the ""Blue Grinch"" character amplifies the sense of nervousness and lack of energy surrounding the experience.The humor lies in its highly specific focus, serving as both a commentary on traditional meme conventions and a departure from them, the Daily Dot reported.The meme focuses on such specific and nuanced situations that its precision itself becomes the punchline, providing a clever commentary on meme culture that is both humorous and insightful.While most memes strive for widespread appeal by tapping into universal emotions, the ""knee surgery"" meme maintains a deliberately narrow scope, which sets it apart.According to Know Your Meme, the first version of this meme was created in 2021 by an anonymous user on MemeCreator.org. It featured an animated squirrel standing upright with its front paws raised, capturing widespread attention when it appeared on the Instagram account stupid.fricken.meme later that year.At present, the ""Blue Grinch knee surgery"" memes remain notably non-political in nature. While it's common for memes that start as neutral to take on political or unexpected directions, this particular format mainly serves as a self-referential commentary on meme culture.(This is a top story on Google Trends)","The meme expresses a specific emotional state associated with a pending knee surgery.

Why Fans Are So Invested in Klay’s Love Life

When it comes to Klay Thompson , fans are just as intrigued by his life off the court as they are by his skills on it. The four-time NBA champion and former Golden State Warriors star is a free agent in 2024, drawing interest from teams across the league. But while his basketball future is up in the air, fans are curious about another aspect of his life: his relationship status.Let’s break down what we know about Klay’s love life this year and take a look back at his dating history.Also read - All you need to know about Jamal Murray's girlfriend, Harper Hempel: Her career, controversy and more As of now, Klay Thompson is single.The 34-year-old guard has always been private about his personal life, leaving much of his romantic history to speculation. The last time his dating life made headlines was in 2022 when rumors swirled about a connection with an Instagram model. However, nothing was ever confirmed.It’s possible Klay is keeping a relationship under wraps—or he might just be focused on himself and his career right now. Either way, there’s no public girlfriend in the picture for 2024.Klay’s dating history has been a mix of high-profile romances and rumored flings, many of which became public through social media or tabloid speculation.Klay’s first notable relationship was with comedian and influencer Hannah Stocking. The pair seemed solid until things ended in drama when Stocking accused Klay of cheating. She even called him out on social media, making their split very public.Shortly after his breakup with Stocking, Klay reportedly started dating stylist Carleen Henry. While their relationship wasn’t heavily publicized, it ended on a rocky note when private messages between the two were leaked, prompting their split.One of Klay’s most high-profile relationships was with actress Laura Harrier. They were frequently spotted together at events, and their romance often made its way to Instagram. The two eventually split in 2020, with rumors suggesting it might have involved another actress, Eiza González. Neither Klay nor Laura confirmed these claims.Over the years, Klay has been linked to several women, including Tiffany Suarez (2015), Cherise Sandra (2016), Abigail Ratchford (2017), and Kristen Evangeline (2022). However, most of these rumors were never substantiated.Klay’s blend of talent, charisma, and a relatively low profile off the court makes him an intriguing figure for fans. Whether he’s posting pictures of his dog Rocco or keeping fans guessing about his personal life, Klay has mastered the art of balancing fame and privacy.For now, it looks like basketball—and possibly signing with a new team—remains his main focus.Also read - NBA Star Dwight Howard on Dancing With the Stars: “Best Decision I Made,” Says It’s Helped His Game",Klay Thompson is a four-time NBA champion and former Golden State Warriors star.

They reported feeling severely distressed by the experience to CBS News.Reddy expressed her intense anxiety, saying she felt an urge to throw all of her devices out of the window, experiencing unprecedented panic.She further explained that whilst experts in generative artificial intelligence suggest such occurrences are common, she had never encountered such targeted hostility towards a user, noting her brother's fortune in having support present.Google maintains that Gemini incorporates safety measures preventing inappropriate, violent, or harmful interactions. Responding to CBS News, Google acknowledged the violation of their policies, describing it as a ""nonsensical"" response and implementing measures to prevent similar incidents.The siblings considered the response more concerning than merely nonsensical, highlighting potential risks for vulnerable individuals experiencing mental health difficulties.Previous incidents involving Google's chatbots include July's health-related misinformation, where AI provided dangerous advice including suggesting rock consumption for nutritional benefits.Google subsequently restricted humour sites in health information and removed viral problematic search results.Other AI platforms have faced similar issues.

CNN reports this trend, citing data from digital intelligence platform Similarweb.On the day after the election, over 115,000 US users deactivated their X accounts on the website. This figure excludes users who deactivated via the mobile app. CNN linked this departure to X owner Elon Musk's support for President-elect Donald Trump during the election.This news follows CNN reports stating that Musk used X to support Trump for months. Additionally, researchers observed a rise in problematic language on the platform since Musk took over.One beneficiary of this shift is Bluesky, an alternative social media platform.

Three prominent journalists – Charlie Warzel, Mara Gay of the New York Times, and former CNN anchor Don Lemon – joined Bluesky this week, leaving X amidst controversy surrounding the platform’s new direction.Musk's decisions to cut moderators, restore previously banned accounts, and change the verification system have drawn criticism.

Go to the official CIBIL website and click on 'Personal CIBIL score,' then 'Get Your Free CIBIL score.' Follow the link provided and fill in all the required details.2. If you don’t have a PAN Card, you can use an alternative identification such as Passport, Voter ID, Driver’s License, or Ration Card. Enter the number of the chosen ID.3.

Depth of credit: This refers to the duration of your existing credit history, calculated from the opening date of your oldest credit account.2. Long-term trend of outstanding balances: The overall trend of outstanding balances over time affects your score.3. Transaction history on credit cards: How you manage transactions on your credit cards impacts your score.4. Ratio of actual repayment amount to total amount due: This ratio indicates your repayment behavior and influences your score accordingly.5.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc).

Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Starting April 1, all users logging into the Central Record-keeping Agency (CRA) system with passwords must use this feature, as per the PFRDA circular dated March 15, 2024.According to ET, using two-factor authentication greatly lowers the risk of unauthorised access to the CRA system . This added layer ensures the safety of NPS transactions and protects the interests of subscribers and stakeholders.The login process for NPS CRAs is changing.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

What Apple said on its support page



“Apple has determined that a small percentage of AirPods Pro may experience sound issues. Affected units were manufactured before October 2020.

An affected AirPods Pro may exhibit one or more of the following behaviours:

Crackling or static sounds that increase in loud environments, with exercise or while talking on the phone

Active Noise Cancellation not working as expected, such as a loss of bass sound, or an increase in background sounds, such as street or airplane noise

Apple or an Apple Authorized Service Provider will service the affected AirPods Pro (left, right or both), free of charge.”

What the lawsuit alleges against



“The AirPods Pro Gen 1 were thus not worth the premium price that consumers paid for them—as they contained an Audio Defect and did not live up to Apple’s advertising, which promised quality audio and noise cancelling capabilities,”

A proposed class action lawsuit in the US reportedly claims that Apple falsely advertised the audio quality of its first-generation AirPods Pro . According to a report by ClassAction.org, the lawsuit alleges that the headphones suffer from known defects that cause crackling or static sounds, loss of bass, and increased background noise, contradicting Apple's claims of superior sound quality.The 51-page class action lawsuit against Apple claims the company misrepresented the audio quality of its first-generation AirPods Pro. Despite promoting the headphones' noise-cancelling capabilities and superior sound, Apple acknowledges audio defects on its website with a dedicated page for troubleshooting issues in devices manufactured before October 2020. The lawsuit argues that Apple's advertising claims and demonstrates a pattern of misleading consumers.Apple in one of its US support pages wrote:The lawsuit against Apple alleges that the company continued to sell first-generation AirPods Pro despite being aware of widespread audio defects. The lawsuit claims that these defects, including crackling, static, and loss of bass, affect all AirPods Pro Gen 1 models, regardless of their manufacturing date.Although consumers reported these problems soon after the product's release in 2019, and Apple acknowledged the issues, the company continued to sell the headphones at a premium price until September 2022.The lawsuit argues that consumers would not have purchased the AirPods Pro, or would have paid less for them, had they known about these defects.

The Phone app will now incorporate a real-time scam detection system, designed to identify and alert users to potential fraudulent calls .This feature leverages Google's advanced AI and machine learning technologies to analyse incoming calls in real-time. By scrutinising various factors such as caller ID, phone number patterns, and call behaviour, the system can accurately detect and flag suspicious calls.Once a call is identified as potentially fraudulent, users will receive a warning notification directly on their phone screen. This timely alert empowers users to make informed decisions and avoid falling victim to scams.“We’ve built Scam Detection to protect your privacy and ensure you’re always in control of your data. Scam Detection is off by default, and you can decide whether you want to activate it for future calls,’ said Google.“At any time, you can turn it off for all calls in the Phone app Settings, or during a particular call.

How to protect your data online

Use a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

Avoid using personal information like birthdays or names.

Create unique passwords for each account.

Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) whenever possible.

Use a password manager to securely store your passwords.

Despite the increasing threat of cyberattacks, many users globally and India continue to rely on weak, easily guessable passwords. Common practices like using sequential numbers or simple word combinations leave accounts vulnerable to hackers. An annual report by NordPass highlighted the most commonly used passwords in India, revealing that several of them can be cracked in mere seconds.NordPass says that it reviewed and analysed a 2.5TB database extracted from various publicly available sources, including those on the dark web. The data has been organised into different categories for analysis by country of origin. The analysed data includes passwords stolen by malware or exposed in data leaks.“123456” has once again claimed the title of the ‘world’s worst password’. The password has topped the charts as the most common password 5 out of 6 times. “Password” held this title just once.To protect data online, it's crucial to adopt strong password practices. Here are some tips to create strong, secure passwords:With tech giants now promoting password-less future with Passkeys, users can create Passkeys wherever applicable.","“123456” has once again claimed the title of the ‘world’s worst password’ The password has topped the charts as the most common password 5 out of 6 times.

In a move to redefine online educational tools, Google has introduced an experimental AI-based learning companion called “Learn About.” Designed with Google’s advanced LearnLM AI model, this tool is aimed at creating an adaptive and interactive learning environment for students, educators, and knowledge-seekers worldwide. In contrast to conventional AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini, “Learn About” presents information in an engaging and accessible format, featuring interactive elements like quizzes, topic-related lists, and contextual information. The platform is currently available in select regions for testing, with a broader release anticipated following the initial trial phase.Google’s “Learn About” is designed to provide a dynamic learning experience, integrating interactive quizzes and additional information boxes to clarify complex topics. These features, which include suggestions for related articles and videos, help users gain a more comprehensive understanding of each subject. Rather than simply delivering answers, the AI organises data visually, encouraging users to explore concepts in greater depth.For example, a student researching space-related topics might receive links to articles and videos explaining astronomical theories, as well as quizzes that reinforce core concepts. This interactive layout is particularly suited to students and researchers who benefit from visual aids and hands-on learning methods. In contrast to Google’s other AI offerings, such as Gemini, which relies on platforms like Wikipedia for information, “Learn About” sources content from specialised educational platforms. For instance, when questioned about the universe's size, it cited Physics Forums, an established academic resource known for its reliable scientific information.“Learn About” tool by Google is distinguished by its commitment to reliable sources, focusing specifically on content that has academic merit and credibility. Google has prioritised sourcing from authoritative educational platforms, aiming to support users in building a robust knowledge base. This aligns with its core objective: promoting quality learning by relying on trustworthy sources rather than generalised databases.This sourcing method not only makes “Learn About” a valuable resource for academic research but also provides teachers and students with a tool they can trust for credible information. The educational model thus stands apart from other general-purpose AI tools by giving users access to thoroughly vetted academic material, reinforcing Google’s vision of responsible AI use in educational settings.Currently, the “Learn About” feature is only available as an experimental offering in limited regions. The tool is accessible through a web platform, allowing users within the designated testing zones to interact with it directly online. Although the feature is not yet available in India, Google plans to expand access following the trial phase, aiming to introduce the platform globally. As the testing phase progresses, Google will likely refine the tool based on user feedback, ensuring a smooth, effective, and enriching learning experience for a wider audience.In related news, Google is also developing document analysis capabilities for its Gemini Live platform. Recent reports indicate that upcoming updates to the Google app’s beta version will introduce new document-uploading features that will enhance the user experience on Gemini Live. Once launched, this tool will enable users to upload documents and engage with AI in a contextual, interactive manner. By allowing users to access their files and have meaningful, context-based conversations around them, Gemini AI aims to foster a more personalised, document-centred approach to digital interaction.As Gemini AI advances, the new document interaction feature will recognize and interpret the content of uploaded files, allowing for more meaningful and targeted responses. Google’s integration of these capabilities signifies its commitment to expanding AI’s role in personalized learning, especially as it becomes increasingly essential in academic and professional contexts.","Google has introduced an experimental AI-based learning companion called ‘Learn About’ Designed with Google’s advanced LearnLM AI model, this tool is aimed at creating an adaptive and interactive learning environment for students, educators, and knowledge-seekers worldwide.

How to save your location history

Google is bringing a significant change to Google Maps location history feature. The tech giant is rolling out an update that will automatically delete location data older than three months from your account.This change aims to shift location history storage to on-device storage instead of the cloud. While this promotes user privacy by reducing data stored on Google's servers, it also means you'll need to take action if you want to preserve your past location data.If you frequently use Google Maps' Timeline feature to revisit your past travels, explore old haunts, or track your commutes, you'll want to act before the deadline. Google has set a deadline of December 8 for users to download and save their location history data older than three months. After that date, any data not downloaded will be automatically deleted.“If you'd like to keep your saved visits and routes, turn on Timeline and choose settings for your data on a smartphone by December 8, 2024. (You may first need to update the Google Maps app.) Turning on this setting will let each of your signed-in devices start saving new visits and routes on its own Timeline. You can also download a copy of your data before it's deleted. If you take no action, your data will be deleted after December 8, 2024,” said Google in an email sent to its users.Here's how to download your location history data before it disappears:1. Go to your Google Account's Activity controls page (https://myactivity.google.com/).2. Select ""Location History"" from the list of options.3. Click on ""Manage Location History.""4. Choose the option to ""Create archive"" and select the data range you want to save.5. Google will create an archive file containing your location data. Once complete, you can download the archive to your device.While this update may require users to adjust their habits slightly, it aligns with Google's broader focus on user privacy. Remember, Google Maps will continue to collect your location data if Timeline is enabled, but it will now be stored on your device for the past three months, with anything older being automatically deleted.",Google is rolling out an update that will automatically delete location data older than three months from your account.

Xiaomi HyperOS 2.0 HyperConnect feature: What we know so far



Take a look at the video here



“Our goal is to be the best compatible with the Apple ecosystem. The future of tech should be connected and collaborative,”

Xiaomi announced its latest HyperOS 2.0 in China last month. The upcoming update from the Chinese smartphone maker will include a feature that improves file sharing between Xiaomi smartphones and Apple devices like iPhones, iPads and Macs. This enhancement, which aims to provide seamless cross-ecosystem compatibility , was recently previewed by the company’s CEO, Lei Jun. Apart from this, HyperOS 2.0 will also introduce a wide range of features including personalised home screen and lock screen options, visual updates, performance boosts, and AI capabilities. The upcoming version is further expected to expand the functionality of the new operating system.In a video shared on social media platform X (earlier Twitter), Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun demonstrated the enhanced cross-platform compatibility of the upcoming HyperOS 2.0.Jun wrote while sharing the video on X.In the video, Jun can be seen showcasing the HyperConnect feature, which allows for quick and easy file transfers between Xiaomi smartphones and Apple devices.The demonstration showed a single-click file transfer from a Xiaomi 15 Pro to an iPhone, iPad, andMac . The feature automatically detects nearby Apple devices and enables seamless file sharing within seconds. This highlights HyperOS 2.0's focus on improved interconnectivity across different ecosystems.Apart from this, Jun also noted HyperOS 2’s feature that will offer extensive compatibility will go beyond simple file sharing. Users will be able to access Apple's proprietary file formats, such as Keynote presentations, directly on their Xiaomi devices without conversion, he added. however, this capability may be limited to Xiaomi 15 and Xiaomi 15 Pro smartphones. Moreover, screen mirroring between Xiaomi smartphones and MacBooks will also be supported, Jun confirmed.This focus on cross-ecosystem compatibility stems from Xiaomi's goal to create an ""interconnected and collaborative"" technology experience. Jun cited the Xiaomi SU7 electric vehicle (EV) project as inspiration, highlighting its development as an EV optimised for Apple product integration.Currently, HyperOS 2.0 is only available in China with no confirmed global release date.

I think the way CM Punk does his business, the way he talks, I’d have so much fun with that. I can just feel it. Even the small interactions that we’ve had — I threw a little bit of trash talk at him before he got here just in case he ever did and now that he’s here, I feel like me and Punk would have a lot of fun.”He further opined, “Sometimes that’s where the biggest heat lies is when you’re too similar. I think me and Punk definitely have our similarities. He’s a guy I’d definitely like to stand across from, especially on the mic, he’s almost untouched the way he carries himself and how confident he is. He doesn’t care.Whether he’s good or bad, he doesn’t care what people think, he’s gonna say what he thinks and I love that energy. I love that he has that energy but I wanna give that back to him. I want to see how he feels when someone does what he does to people to him. That’s how I felt with Shawn (Michaels) a little bit. It’s like, ‘Shawn, remember what you used to be like? How’s it feel, now you’re feeling what it’s like to have you coming at you.’ I feel that with Punk. Punk’s ruling it right now but I want to be CM Punk from 15 years ago coming at him and see how he reacts and feels about that.”ALSO READ: John Cena gives major update regarding Royal Rumble 2025 Punk’s return to WWE has already been marked by a series of high-stakes encounters, including a brutal Hell in a Cell match against Drew McIntyre.
