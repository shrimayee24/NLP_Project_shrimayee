Patrick Mahomes' third child’s name might follow a unique family tradition as Netflix analysts weigh in on the possible choice,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/patrick-mahomes-third-childs-name-might-follow-a-unique-family-tradition-as-netflix-analysts-weigh-in-on-the-possible-choice/articleshow/116801349.cms,"Image via Brittany Mahomes/Instagram

Netflix Analysts Have A New Name For Patrick Mahomes’ Third Child With Wife Brittany Mahomes

Patrick Mahomes Is Not Stressing Out His Wife Brittany Mahomes

Patrick Mahomes is having one of the best years of his life. His team, the Kansas City Chiefs , has entered into the playoffs and he is all set to welcome his third child, a daughter, with his wife, Brittany Mahomes . Recently, the NFL star revealed that his wife is “due any time now” and as per reports, he is gearing up for the birth of his third child. But fans are busy speculating the name of his third child and it looks like Netflix analysts have come up with a probable new name for his third child.As the Kansas City Chiefs won against the Pittsburgh Steelers on Christmas Day, Netflix analysts Nate Burleson, J.J. Watt and Ian Eagle started speculating what can be the name of Patrick’s third child and second daughter. The Netflix analysts were live on air when they came up with the name “Platinum Mahomes”. While this name might sound very unique, there are chances that the NFL star, Patrick and his wife Brittany actually decide to name their child “Platinum Mahomes”.The reason for this is, that fans have noticed a pattern behind the names of Patrick and Brittany’s children. It looks like the couple is obsessed with naming their children as well as their two pets around metals. Their older daughter is named Sterling Skye, their toddler son is named Patrick Bronze Lavon and their pets are named Silver and Steele.This was a humorous take on the naming pattern of Patrick and Brittany’s children and fans could not get enough of it. Fortunately, the fans do not have to wait for too long for the popular couple to reveal the name of their third child.Last week the NFL star and quarterback of the Kansas City Chiefs revealed in an interview that his wife, Brittany Mahomes, had told him that he has been stressing her out too much this season. So now Patrick has decided to not keep his wife worried about anything and to manage everything on his own. In the same interview, he also revealed that their third child is “due any time” now and they are currently gearing up for her birth.Patrick’s wife Brittany has been a huge support to him. When Patrick won the MVP in the 2022 NFL season, he had credited his wife and children for the success he has achieved. This has not changed a bit even two years later. Brittany has always been spotted supporting and cheering Travis on. But it looks like her third pregnancy had kept her away from attending the Chiefs vs Steelers game on Christmas day. This also makes sense since Brittany might be very close to her due date and is trying to take care of her health at this time.Also Read: Taylor Swift's $36,000 De Beers earrings shine bright during an unforgettable date night with Travis Kelce in New York City","Netflix Analysts Have A New Name For Patrick Mahomes’ Third Child With Wife Brittany Mahomes.

Why Don Lemon cackled maniacally and trashed MAGA fans as ‘Dumb f***ing idiots’ over H-1B visa feud with Musk; Social media reacts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-don-lemon-cackled-maniacally-and-trashed-maga-fans-as-dumb-fing-idiots-over-h-1b-visa-feud-with-musk-social-media-reacts/articleshow/116812682.cms,"Independent media personality Don Lemon haughtily cackled during an expletive-laden screed over the MAGA world flare-up over H1-B visas for specialty workers.

Social media reacts to Lemon’s rant

'Too delicious to ignore'

The Post

Don Lemon didn’t just comment on the latest MAGA drama — he gleefully tore into it. In a scathing, profanity-laced tirade that has since gone viral, the independent media personality mocked Trump supporters for their shocking inability to see through Elon Musk ’s support of H-1B visas, sparking a meltdown in the MAGA world.Lemon’s notorious maniacal cackle took center stage during his YouTube rant, where he mocked Trump fans as “dumb f***king idiots” for being blindsided by Musk’s position on the H-1B visa program. “You dumb f***king idiots! Now you’re just figuring this sh** out,” Lemon sneered, clearly relishing the spectacle of MAGA's internal strife.The chaos erupted after Musk and tech mogul Vivek Ramaswamy — both major figures in Trump’s orbit — threw their support behind the H-1B visa system, which allows US companies to hire skilled foreign workers when they can't find enough Americans to fill the roles. The backlash was swift from staunch MAGA supporters, with figures like Laura Loomer slamming the move, accusing Musk of betraying the populist, anti-immigration cause.But Lemon wasn’t done. As the MAGA infighting escalated, he went on to tear apart the very core of Trump’s movement. “You have stupid MAGA brain,” he ranted, accusing Trump supporters of being too blinded by their allegiance to the former president to see what was really happening. “You’re in a f***king cult and you don’t even realize it,” Lemon added, mocking their lack of self-awareness.The comment seemed to be a direct jab at the MAGA base’s unwavering loyalty to Trump — even when he’s surrounded by figures like Musk, who have increasingly aligned with policies that conflict with the populist movement's anti-immigrant stance.The internet was quick to react to Lemon’s fiery outburst, with many users taking to social media to voice their opinions.One user commented, “Holy shit Don Lemon has officially lost his damn mind.” Another added, “He does sound hormonal af.”Another user took a shot at Lemon’s career, saying, “Since being fired from CNN, Don Lemon's career has crashed faster than Biden from sundowning. While Lemon pretended he left for his fake Liberal virtue, he really left because his ego couldn’t handle the mocking he received after his contract fell through. As you can see from this video, Lemon's situation is not improving. He should join Mark Hamil and Rob Reiner in the mental health facility. Don Lemon's video is not the flex on MAGA he thinks it is. Enjoy the meltdown.”Others took a more critical stance: “He’s hit rock bottom. I’m trying to find the interview where he asks random people whether they think Elon is actually the president. He cites MSM and gets laughed at.”One user remarked, “Don Lemon appears to be losing his mind. What stage of grief is this? ‘You’ve been co-opted into a cult and you don’t even realize it because you have stupid MAGA brain and you don’t get it. How stupid and dumb are you?’ Projection 101.”A more thought-provoking response came from another user who wrote, “The right hates Don Lemon because he’s black, intelligent, articulate, and factually points out what MAGA doesn’t want to acknowledge about themselves and their cult-like movement & leader. MAGA hates intelligent people of color.”Lemon’s rant also alluded to Trump’s controversial remark earlier this year about immigrants taking away “black jobs.” “Who’s to say that one of those jobs might be a ‘white job’?” Lemon chuckled, further driving the point home that MAGA’s rhetoric is often contradictory, especially as the conversation shifts on issues like immigration.Even as Musk and Ramaswamy defended the H-1B program, claiming it needed reform, the growing tension within MAGA ranks was undeniable. Trump himself later weighed in, telling, “I’ve always liked the visas. I have always been in favor of the visas. That’s why we have them.”For Lemon, it was all too delicious to ignore. Once a CNN anchor who found himself at the center of controversy over remarks about Nikki Haley, Lemon has embraced his role as an outspoken critic. With his latest rant, he’s shown that he’s not afraid to go for the jugular — especially when MAGA’s contradictions create the perfect storm for drama.","Independent media personality Don Lemon's expletive-laced tirade over the MAGA world flare-up has gone viral.

The plant incorporates active and passive safety features, including a double-shell containment structure and a reactor-filtered venting system.With a lifespan of 60 years, C-5 is the third nuclear power plant in Pakistan to feature this advanced design. The Karachi Nuclear Power Plants—units 2 and 3—of similar specifications are already operational and contributing to the national grid.The construction of C-5 has been approved by the executive committee of the National Economic Council and is projected to cost $3.7 billion. Once operational, the plant will bolster Pakistan’s nuclear energy capacity, which currently stands at approximately 3,530 MW, accounting for about 27 percent of the country's total electricity generation.","The Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Authority has granted the licence for the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Unit 5 (C-5) C-5 will have a capacity of 1,200 megawatts electric (MWe), making it the largest nuclear electricity generation plant in the country.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116791813,imgsize-709001,width-400,resizemode-4/116791813.jpg"

Sandringham's history and royal tensions

Happier times at Sandringham

The Royal Family gathers at King Charles' Sandringham estate in Norfolk each Christmas, continuing a tradition dating back to Queen Victoria. The 20,000-acre estate, purchased in 1862, holds significant historical value for the family. George V, former king of the UK, famously cherished Sandringham, saying, ""Dear old Sandringham, the place I love better than anywhere else in the world."" More than 160 years after it was first acquired by the royal family, the estate remains a cherished setting for the royal Christmas celebrations.The preparations for the holiday include selecting a large Christmas tree from the estate grounds, a tradition started by King Charles' great-great-great-grandfather, Prince Albert. King Charles selects a 20-foot Norfolk spruce tree from the grounds each year. The tree is typically decorated with red, gold, and purple ornaments, along with twinkling Christmas lights. The Grand Staircase is often adorned with festive decorations, and the Waterloo Chamber is transformed into a winter wonderland.The King also approves menus for Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and Boxing Day. The chef traditionally carves the turkey in front of the guests. However, one change King Charles may make concerns the temperature in the home. Prince Harry previously described Sandringham’s temperature as “balmy,” saying, “The corgis always betrayed us. The cool air would make them whimper, and Granny would say: 'Is there a draft?' And then a footman would promptly shut the window.”Guests arrive on Christmas eve based on seniority. As Sandringham is the smallest of the royal residences, some guests may have to sleep in rooms typically reserved for staff. One quirky tradition involves guests weighing themselves upon arrival. A tradition from Edward VII involved weighing guests upon arrival and departure to ensure they were well-fed.The family enjoys afternoon tea at 4 pm, with favorites such as square sandwiches, ham and English mustard, Sage Derby cheese, and Coronation Chicken. Desserts include ginger cake, honey and cream sponge, scones, and a pot of Earl Grey tea.At 6 pm, the family exchanges small, humorous gifts, a nod to the German tradition of ""Heiligabend Bescherung,"" introduced by Prince Albert. Princess Diana once gave Sarah Ferguson a leopard print bath mat, while Kate, Princess of Wales, gifted a ""grow your own girlfriend"" kit to a bachelor Prince Harry.Later in the evening, after the children go to bed, a formal dinner is served for the adults, with men in black tie and women in ballgowns and jewels. The meal is followed by martinis and a lavish four-course feast.Christmas day starts with breakfast and an 11 am church service at St Mary Magdalene Church. The royals greet the crowds as they leave the church. The family returns to Sandringham for pre-lunch drinks, including Veuve Clicquot champagne, and a traditional Christmas dinner at 1 pm. The meal includes turkey, potatoes, vegetables, sprouts, carrots, and parsnips, with Christmas pudding served with brandy butter and brandy sauce, followed by a cheese course with port. The table is decorated with white linen, candelabras, and a sprig of the Holy Thorn, a tradition that dates back before the Reformation.The King's speech is watched on television afterward. The family spends the rest of the afternoon at leisure.In the evening, guests enjoy a buffet of traditional English cuisine, including boar's head, ox tongue, and seafood, along with a table of chocolates and mints.Boxing Day features a hunt for the men, followed by lunch and dinner with traditional dishes. The meal typically consists of hearty fare, such as beef bourguignon with mashed potatoes and red cabbage. For dessert, there is apple pie and Christmas pudding slices fried in unsalted butter. Dinner that evening might feature venison with dauphinoise potatoes and carrots, followed by a chocolate pie made of cream, meringue, and cinnamon.Sandringham has witnessed its share of controversy over the years. Princess Diana, who was often unhappy spending Christmas at the estate, would frequently chat with the staff to avoid family members. Royal chef Darren McGrady recalled how Diana would walk around the kitchen after dinner, seeking refuge from the tight quarters of the estate, which he described as “so compact.”In Andrew Morton's biography, Diana was quoted describing a dramatic row with Prince Charles in 1982 when she was pregnant with Prince William. ""I threw myself down the stairs,"" she reportedly said. ""Charles said I was crying wolf, and I said I felt so desperate, and I was crying my eyes out, and he said: 'I'm not going to listen. You're always doing this to me. I'm going riding now.'""Sandringham also hosted a tense summit in January 2020 between King Charles and his sons, Prince William and Prince Harry, after Harry announced he would step back from royal duties. The meeting led to a public statement from the Queen, wishing Harry and Meghan a “peaceful and happy new life.” Meghan Markle , who enjoyed her first Christmas at Sandringham in 2017, shared a fond memory with her mother. “It’s just like a big family like I always wanted,” she said during a phone call. ""There was just this constant movement and energy and fun."" Prince Harry also spoke of happier times, saying, ""Christmas was fantastic.""","The Royal Family gathers at King Charles' Sandringham estate in Norfolk each Christmas.

Why Princess Diana 'hated' spending Christmas with royal family?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/why-princess-diana-hated-spending-christmas-with-royal-family/articleshow/116650976.cms,"Princess Diana (Picture credit: AP)

'Diana hated Sandringham'

‘No boisterous behavior’

Disappointment over gag gifts

Familiar yet unwelcome traditions

Royal experts weigh in

Princess Diana reportedly 'hated' spending Christmas with the royal family at Sandringham Estate in UK. Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine, revealed that Diana found the royal holiday traditions “claustrophobic.”Speaking to Fox News Digital, Seward explained that Diana felt constrained by the royal customs, saying she did not want to follow so many rules to enjoy herself. “Diana hated Sandringham,” Seward said. “Even when her romance with Charles was going well, she still didn’t like it… I think she found it claustrophobic because Diana was such a free spirit. She didn’t want to have to enjoy herself with so many rules. [But] they’re not rules. They’re just traditions of royalty.” Seward noted that the order of precedence and other royal traditions made Diana uncomfortable.In his 1992 book Diana: Her True Story, author Andrew Morton recounted Diana’s experience during her first Christmas at Sandringham in 1981. She had given expensive gifts, while the royal family exchanged gag gifts.“It was highly fraught,” Diana told Morton. “I know I gave, but I can’t remember being a receiver. Isn’t that awful? I do all the presents, and Charles signs the cards. [It was] terrifying and so disappointing. No boisterous behavior, lots of tension, silly behavior, silly jokes that outsiders would find odd, but insiders understood.” Diana added, “I sure was [an outsider].”Seward corroborated this story, sharing that a friend who worked at Sandringham witnessed Diana’s disappointment. Diana reportedly gave cashmere sweaters and other expensive items but received a simple, less thoughtful gift in return. “She just couldn’t understand [it],” Seward said. “To her, Christmas was all about spending a bit more than you could probably afford and getting really nice presents.”Despite her dislike for the traditions, Diana was familiar with Sandringham as her father had a house on the estate. However, her hairdresser, Richard Dalton, told author Kitty Kelley that Diana “hated going to Sandringham for Christmas,” mentioning the cold and the requirement to watch the Queen’s Christmas message on television. Dalton referred to it as a “command performance.” An unnamed friend also told author Tina Brown that Diana dreaded going to Sandringham.Royal experts shared their views on Diana’s experience at Sandringham. Hilary Fordwich explained that Diana’s gift-giving experience was “embarrassing and painful,” as she wasn’t aware of the family’s gag gift tradition. Nick Bullen, co-founder of True Royalty TV, commented that the royals exchange “silly joke presents,” with author Christopher Andersen noting that Queen Elizabeth II preferred gag gifts. Andersen also claimed that Prince Charles’ favorite gift was a toilet seat from Princess Anne.King Charles and Diana had separated in 1992 and divorced in 1996.","Princess Diana reportedly 'hated' spending Christmas with the royal family at Sandringham Estate in UK.

Capable of engaging targets up to 200 kilometres away, THAAD covers a larger area than the Patriot missile system and complements other defence platforms like the Aegis and Ground-based Midcourse systems.

A THAAD battery includes six truck-mounted launchers, 48 interceptors, an advanced AN/TPY-2 radar system, and a fire control unit. Deployment: Operated by a crew of 95 soldiers, the system is rapidly deployable and designed to protect against evolving missile threats both within and outside the atmosphere.

The United States' Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system was deployed in Israel to intercept a Houthi ballistic missile launched from Yemen, Times of Israel reported. This marks the first operational use of the advanced missile defence system since its deployment to Israel in October. Footage shared on social media captured the dramatic launch of a THAAD interceptor, with an American soldier exclaiming, ""Eighteen years I’ve been waiting for this.""The missile, reportedly targeting Israel, was neutralised by air defence systems. However, the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) have not specified whether the interception was achieved by the American THAAD or an Israeli system. According to sources cited by Reuters, an analysis is underway to determine the success of the THAAD system.The Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system is a cornerstone of the US ballistic missile defence network. Designed to intercept short- to intermediate-range ballistic missiles during their terminal phase, THAAD employs “hit-to-kill” technology, where interceptors physically collide with incoming missiles to destroy them. This approach minimises collateral damage and maximises precision.Originally developed by Lockheed Martin in the 1990s, THAAD has undergone significant testing and enhancements. The US Army currently operates seven THAAD batteries, with deployments in strategic locations such as Guam and South Korea, and most recently, Israel.","The Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system is a cornerstone of the US ballistic missile defence network.

The fallout is apparently so bad that her upcoming cookery show—still without a premiere date—is being labeled as her “make or break” moment. “It’s so much work with her, and, bluntly, the ‘deliverable’ does not seem to be worth it,” one insider said.Adding fuel to the fire, there’s been zero buzz around the polo series. No press tours, no promotional events, no hype. Even Nacho Figueras, Harry’s polo pal and a star of the series, has barely mentioned it on social media. Hollywood veteran Sean McNulty told The Daily Beast: “The lack of a proper press campaign for a Harry and Meghan project is eyebrow-raising, to say the least.”According to reports, Meghan’s cookery show is now the Sussexes’ last hope at staying in Netflix’s good graces. One entertainment exec was quotes by the Daily Mail as saying, “Her show will have to be an enormous hit to turn around their deal and their reputations in this town.”The show is expected to drop in early 2024, coinciding with Harry’s appearance at the Winter Invictus Games in Canada and the launch of Meghan’s homeware brand, American Riviera Orchard . Talk about multitasking under pressure.Critics are having a field day with Harry and Meghan’s current reputation—or lack thereof. Marketing expert Tony Case didn’t mince words, was quoted by the Daily Beast as saying, “Harry and Meghan are box office poison. Everyone is running away from this colossal bomb.”He added, “They set out to conquer America, but no one here found them—or what they’re selling—to be particularly compelling.”Even their highly-publicized project Meet Me at the Lake, based on a best-selling novel, remains in limbo. With no production in sight, it’s unlikely to materialize before their Netflix deal is up for renewal next year.Friends who once hyped their projects are unusually quiet, fueling speculation that Hollywood may be losing patience with the couple. A source quoted in Closer Magazine tried to defend the Sussexes, blaming Netflix for pushing a “reality TV angle” that was out of their control.","The Sussexes’ partnership with Netflix has hit a rough patch, with insiders whispering about mounting frustration and dwindling faith in their ability to deliver hits. “It’s so much work with her, and, bluntly, the ‘deliverable’ does not seem to be worth it,” one insider said.

‘Sleep Divorce’ on vacation

As 2024 draws to a close, the year’s quirkiest travel trends have left a lasting impression on globetrotters and social media feeds alike. From passengers sneaking into boarding lines to minimalist packing styles, these viral travel phenomena are both entertaining and eye-opening.Ever found someone cutting the line at the airport, eager to board early? Meet the “gate lice” trend. This term humorously refers to passengers who hover around boarding gates, attempting to sneak ahead of their group. The issue has grown so pervasive that American Airlines has rolled out tech solutions at over 100 airports. Their system audibly alerts gate agents and automatically denies tickets for early boarders. “It’s about creating a smoother experience for everyone,” an American Airlines spokesperson explained.For those tired of baggage fees and bin space battles, “flying naked” offers a solution: travel with nothing but the essentials. Think phone, wallet, and charger—no luggage, no stress. Fans praise the trend’s simplicity, with one user calling it “liberating.” However, not everyone is sold. “What about souvenirs?” asked a skeptical commenter.While some travel to relax, others travel strategically. The trend of “mattress runs” has travelers booking hotel stays they never intend to complete, all to rack up loyalty points or free nights. Avid participants see it as a clever hack, while critics label it wasteful. “It’s the ultimate game of points,” joked one frequent flyer on TikTok.Airline etiquette took a hit this year as “seat squatters” became increasingly bold. These travelers snag seats they haven’t paid for, hoping to score an upgrade without the cost. While some get away with it, others face public confrontations. One viral TikTok showed a traveler telling off a squatter: “I paid for this seat. Get out.”Even love takes a backseat when it comes to good sleep. The “sleep divorce” trend sees couples opting for separate beds during vacations, prioritizing rest over romance. Hilton’s 2025 Trends report revealed that 63% of travelers prefer sleeping alone for better quality sleep, and 37% opt for separate beds when traveling as a couple.These trends, whether practical, amusing, or downright baffling, highlight the creativity—and occasional chaos—of modern travel. As we step into 2025, who knows what new quirks will define our journeys? Whatever they may be, one thing is certain: travel is as much about the stories as it is about the destinations.","The year's quirkiest travel trends have left a lasting impression on globetrotters and social media feeds alike.

The countdown to December 31

What started as a niche joke has snowballed into a viral TikTok event, with millions of users eagerly awaiting December 31, 2024, for the “Vexbolts Mass Unfollowing.” The campaign encourages users to unfollow TikToker Vexbolts en masse on New Year’s Eve, turning what might have been a quiet end to the year into an internet spectacle .The campaign kicked off in late December when TikTok comments began flooding videos with the cryptic phrase: “Vexbolts mass unfollowing Dec 31st, spread the word.” Ironically, the movement has skyrocketed Vexbolts’ follower count as users join in just to participate in the anticipated event.“It’s not even about his content anymore,” one commenter quipped. “We’re all just here for the chaos.”The trend took off after TikToker unemployedcrashout posted a video on December 25, which racked up over 530,000 views in just 24 hours. From there, videos promoting the event, often set to one of Vexbolts’ original sounds—like his song about the Low Taper Fade meme—spread like wildfire.Vexbolts initially seemed unfazed, posting a celebratory video on December 25 when his follower count surpassed 2 million. “I love you all!” he said in the clip, but comments quickly poked fun at the situation. “You realize we’re only here to leave on the 31st, right?” one user joked.By December 29, with his follower count exceeding 5 million, Vexbolts leaned into the joke. He posted a video of himself looking distressed, captioned: “Kai Cenat, please save me from the mass unfollowing.” The clip, which included a dramatized shot of his live follower count dropping, has already amassed 8.5 million views.The “mass unfollowing” has become a phenomenon across TikTok, with streamers joining in. IShowSpeed urged his followers to participate, saying, “This is the funniest thing on the app right now.” Others, like StableRonaldo and JasonTheWeen, have called for calm, encouraging fans to resist the movement.“It’s ridiculous,” JasonTheWeen said in a livestream. “Let the guy live!”With just hours to go until the clock strikes midnight, the internet is buzzing with anticipation. Will millions of users actually unfollow Vexbolts, or will the joke backfire? For now, the TikToker seems to be enjoying the spotlight, albeit with a hint of unease.“Whatever happens, happens,” Vexbolts said in his latest video. “If you’re here on January 1, you’re a real one.”Whether it’s a fleeting joke or a glimpse into the unpredictable power of internet trends, the “Vexbolts Mass Unfollowing” has cemented its place as one of TikTok’s most bizarre yet entertaining moments of the year.",The “Vexbolts Mass Unfollowing” has become a phenomenon across TikTok.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Other extensions, such as ParrotTalks, Uvoice, and VPNCity, were also impacted starting in mid-December, according to Jaime Blasco from Nudge Security, as reported by Reuters.The breach was first detected on December 25, and researchers quickly removed the harmful version of the extension within an hour.“On December 24, a phishing attack compromised a Cyberhaven employee's credentials to the Google Chrome Web Store. The attacker used these credentials to publish a malicious version of our Chrome extension (version 24.10.4). Our security team detected this compromise at 11:54 PM UTC on December 25 and removed the malicious package within 60 minutes,” Cyberhaven said in a blog post.According to Cyberhaven, the incident was brief and limited in scope. Only version 24.10.4 of the Cyberhaven Chrome extension was affected, and the malicious code was active from 1:32 AM UTC on December 25 to 2:50 AM UTC on December 26. Chrome browsers that auto-updated the extension during this time were impacted.The company clarified, ""Our investigation found that no other Cyberhaven systems were compromised."" For affected browsers, the malicious code may have stolen cookies and login sessions from certain websites. Initial findings suggest the attacker specifically targeted logins to social media advertising and AI platforms.","Hackers have injected harmful code into several Google Chrome extensions, targeting users of Facebook Ads.

"Spotify’s search results are exposing users to adult content, what the company has to say",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/spotifys-search-results-are-exposing-users-to-adult-content-what-the-company-has-to-say/articleshow/116803090.cms,"What Spotify has to say

Spotify is once again facing scrutiny over adult content slipping through its moderation filters and appearing in search results on the app. As per a report, a search for rapper M.I.A. yielded a pornographic video among the suggested results.A Reddit user exposed the issue by sharing a screenshot of the search results, The Verge reported, adding that it is unable to replicate the original finding but uncovered other sexually explicit videos hidden within the “Video” tab of Spotify's search results.These videos, often uploaded by accounts with generic or nonsensical names on the popular music streaming service, appear to exploit a loophole in Spotify's podcast moderation system.Spotify spokesperson Laura Batey told The Verge that the reported videos have been removed for violating the platform's policies, which explicitly prohibit sexually explicit material. However, an explanation for how these videos bypassed their moderation process has purportedly not been addressed.This latest incident highlights an ongoing problem for Spotify. Users have previously reported encountering explicit content in search results, algorithmic playlists, and even disguised as erotic audio tracks. In 2022, Vice also documented the prevalence of sexually explicit audio and graphic images on the platform.Recently, a report revealed that the platform is being exploited to spread malware, pirated software, and spam through playlists and podcasts. Security researchers discovered that malicious actors have been using playlist and podcast descriptions to distribute links to harmful websites and illicit content.These malicious actors are exploiting Spotify's search engine optimisation (SEO) to reach a wider audience. Even if Spotify blocks certain keywords on its platform, searching for those keywords on Google can still lead users to malicious links hosted within Spotify playlists and podcasts.Furthermore, spammers are using misleading tactics to attract unsuspecting users. They often employ irrelevant audio content and titles related to trending topics, like TikTok or adult content, to increase visibility in search results.","A search for rapper M.I.A. yielded a pornographic video among the suggested results.

What is behind Apple’s ‘allergy’ to the world’s biggest and most successful AI chip company Nvidia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/what-is-behind-apples-allergy-to-the-worlds-biggest-and-most-successful-ai-chip-company-nvidia/articleshow/116800458.cms,"What is Apple's 'allergy' with Nvidia

Apple looking to partner with Broadcom to design AI chip

While Apple has joined the ranks of tech giants integrating AI features into its devices, the company is quietly pursuing a strategy to reduce its reliance on Nvidia, the dominant provider of GPUs crucial for AI development, a report has said. Despite currently depending on the chipmaker's technology, like many others in the industry, Apple is taking steps to lessen its dependence on Nvidia because of an 'allergy'.According to a report by The Information, unlike other tech giants who are buying up Nvidia's GPUs in bulk, Apple is primarily renting access to them through cloud providers.“Instead of buying boatloads of Nvidia chips as its tech peers do, the iPhone maker mostly rents access to them from cloud providers like Amazon and Microsoft. In some cases-for example, to train its biggest models-Apple has rented Al chips designed in-house by Google rather than Nvidia,” the report said.Apple’s move to break free from Nvidia appears to be rooted in both financial considerations and Apple's desire for technological autonomy in its products, the report said.“Apple's Nvidia allergy appears to stem partly from its frugality and a desire to own and control the key technological ingredients for its products to avoid giving others leverage over its operations,” it added.“But leaders within Apple have also quietly nursed grudges against Nvidia for nearly two decades, stemming from business disputes that originated during the era when Steve Jobs was Apple's CEO,” the report noted, citing 10 former Apple and Nvidia employees with direct knowledge of the relationship.The report says that the most significant development in Apple's quest for independence is a partnership with Broadcom to develop its own AI server chip .“And in its boldest move yet to avoid relying on Nvidia, Apple is working with Broadcom to design an Al server chip expected to be ready for mass production by 2026,” it added.The chip's networking technology is said to be crucial for Al processing. If Apple succeeds with the Al chip, internally code-named Baltra, it would mark a significant milestone for the company's silicon team, the publication said.","Apple looking to partner with Broadcom to design AI chip, report says.
