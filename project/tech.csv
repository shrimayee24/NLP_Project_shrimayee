"Astronaut, IISc prof pitch for back-up control for safer re-entry",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/astronaut-iisc-prof-pitch-for-back-up-control-for-safer-re-entry/articleshow/121388989.cms,"BENGALURU: Isro astronaut Group Captain Angad Pratap and Assistant Professor Jishnu Keshavan from IISc, are in the final phases of their research to demonstrate the viability of a manual control system as an additional safety measure during the critical atmospheric re-entry phase of a manned spacecraft returning to Earth.The re-entry phase involves complex aerodynamics and narrow margins for error. Too steep an entry could lead to excessive heating, while too shallow a path risks the capsule skipping off the atmosphere. Pratap and Keshavan’s research focuses on a possible scenario of a failure in the primary automatic Navigation, Guidance and Control (NGC) system of a crew module during re-entry.To address this, the team explored whether an astronaut could manually guide the spacecraft in such conditions with support from a partially degraded NGC system. Their system is not being designed to replace the primary NGC architecture but to complement it.The objective of automated guidance during re-entry is to ensure accurate tracking of a predefined reference trajectory all the way to touchdown. This requires designing a guidance law capable of countering potential disturbances that could otherwise alter the spacecraft’s descent profile and cause deviations from the intended landing point—an outcome that must be avoided in practice.As per the abstract of their research presented at the recently concluded Global Space Exploration Conference (GLEX-2025), to mitigate this possibility, the study explored the feasibility of incorporating “a novel bank-angle based manual control scheme in a manned spacecraft during re-entry in the atmospheric altitudes of 120km - 10 km”.“Bank-angle manipulation” used here is the same fundamental principle employed by automated systems, but adapted for human operation, as per the abstract titled “Robust Manual Guidance Law For Manned Spacecraft Re-Entry Applications”.Using sophisticated 6-DOF (six degree-of-freedom) modelling incorporating both translational and rotational dynamics, researchers demonstrated that human pilots could successfully guide a representative manned spacecraft from re-entry altitude to parachute deployment while maintaining all critical parameters within safe limits.Manual mode is proposed as an additional backup to the multiple chains of automated modes of reentry control in case of the flight profile either exceeding predefined perturbation models, or identical failure across all automated control chains.Incorporating this additional degree of manual redundancy may enhance mission reliability for the crew capsule. The manual control scheme was explored from the standpoint of guiding the manned spacecraft manually from a predefined reentry altitude to the terminal altitude thus guaranteeing subsequent touchdown at the predefined target location.The study describes the design and testing of a “reduced-order” flight display and manual control setup intended for emergency use. Drawing from operational precedents such as Nasa’s Apollo missions, the system provides a pilot with essential information through an intuitive interface. This would allow the crew to steer the capsule towards a pre-designated landing area, even in the absence of automated controls.","Isro astronaut Angad Pratap and Assistant Professor Jishnu Keshavan from IISc, are in the final phases of their research to demonstrate the viability of a manual control system.

What is U visa? How Indian-origin Rambhai Patel staged 'armed robberies' for this visa fraud in New York,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-u-visa-how-indian-origin-rambhai-patel-staged-armed-robberies-for-this-visa-fraud-in-new-york/articleshow/121382552.cms,"Indian-origin man Rambhai Patel pleaded guilty in U Visa scam.

How was the U visa fraud orchestrated



What is a U Visa?







If someone becomes a victim of certain crimes during their stay in the US and then helps law enforcement in the investigation process, they are eligible to get the U visa -- after all cross checks and verifications. As an Indian-origin man, Rambhai Patel, recently pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit visa fraud, the entire modus operandi has now come out. The 37-year-old Indian man residing in New York used to stage armed robberies at restaurants so that the restaurant staff could claim a U Visa. In return, Rambhai Patel got hefty money from the staged victims.On May 22, Patel pleaded guilty. He was charged in December 2023 along with a co-conspirator. Patel will be sentenced on August 20. The charge of conspiracy to commit visa fraud provides for a sentence of up to five years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000. And Patel will be deported after the completion of any sentence imposed.According to the documents of the Justice Department, Patel and his alleged co-conspirator started these staged robberies in March 2023. All of these were armed robberies to qualify for the visa requirements.They robbed at least nine convenience/liquor stores and fast-food restaurants across the US -- including at least five in Massachusetts. The purpose of the staged robberies was to allow the store clerks to claim that they were victims of a violent crime on an application for U nonimmigrant status which is available to victims of certain crimes who have suffered mental or physical abuse and who have been helpful to law enforcement in the investigation or prosecution of criminal activity.In the staged robbery, the fake robber used to threaten the store staff with a firearm before taking cash from the register and fled. The entire action had to be done in front of a surveillance camera so that there would be enough evidence. The restaurant owners then called the police to report the crime only when the fake robbers escaped. One fake victim paid Patel $20000 to include him in his staged robbery so that he could get a U visa. Patel then paid the store owners for the use of their stores for the robbery. At least two purported victim co-conspirators submitted U Visa applications based on being victims of the staged armed robberies.The U visa is a nonimmigrant visa in the US, specifically designed for victims of certain crimes who have suffered substantial mental or physical abuse and are willing to assist law enforcement and government officials in the investigation or prosecution of the criminal activity. It was created under the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, which also includes the Battered Immigrant Women’s Protection Act. A U visa grants temporary legal status, typically for up to 4 years, along with work authorization (via an Employment Authorization Document, or EAD). It also offers protection from deportation, which is crucial for victims assisting law enforcement.","Indian-origin man Rambhai Patel pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit visa fraud.

Damon Feldman bids boxing ring to end Jordon Hudson vs Linda Holliday tension

Fans want to know but nothing yet from either party

In a stunning gesture that blends celebrity gossip and sports drama, Celebrity Boxing has made a public invite to Jordon Hudson and Linda Holliday. The offer comes on the heels of news of an awkward fight between the two women at Nantucket's Christmas party in 2024. Both have a connection with former NFL coach Bill Belichick, Holliday being his long-time ex, while Hudson is currently dating him.Celebrity Boxing chief Damon Feldman directly wooed both Hudson and Holliday in a video message. ""I want to provide them with the opportunity and stage here at Celebrity Boxing to fight that beef out in the ring,"" Feldman said. ""Let's get it, girls."" The proposal is straightforward: take the two women's offstage tension and make it a public boxing fight for their fans to see.Though no money figures or fight dates were disclosed, the promotional agency is famous for arranging bouts between reality television personalities, viral internet monikers, and pop culture icons.Since Belichick's love life has been in the news and there was an incident at the December party, this matchup would certainly be very popular.Hudson and Holliday reportedly had a ""verbal altercation"" at a holiday party, according to a source.Sources indicate that Hudson didn't initiate anything, but was asked to leave after an extremely awkward evening.

Others refer to the proposal as ""wild,"" and some believe it's only another move to make personal drama entertainment.This kind of event is not new to Celebrity Boxing. The firm has organized bouts for past sportsmen, film actors, and social media stars. Tapping into real-life rivalries as the source of energy, they develop events that combine entertainment, drama, and brawling all under the lens of the camera.Whether Hudson and Holliday accept or decline, Feldman’s offer shows how far companies will go to mix reality with entertainment. For now, all eyes are on the women to see if either one will step into the ring.","Celebrity Boxing chief Damon Feldman invited Jordon Hudson and Linda Holliday to a boxing match.

"Microsoft Layoffs: Microsoft's fired AI director to 6,000 laid off employees along with her: ""These are people who…""",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/microsofts-fired-ai-director-to-6000-laid-off-employees-along-with-her-these-are-people-who/articleshow/121245726.cms,"Microsoft layoffs 2025 hit 6,000 employees worldwide, including AI Director Gabriela de Queiroz. As the tech giant pushes deeper into artificial intelligence, industry experts question the decision. Find out why even AI leaders weren’t safe from Microsoft’s sudden cuts.

Poll Do you think AI will replace more jobs in the future? No, humans will always be needed. Yes, it's inevitable.

To those also affected—you're not alone, we're at least 6,000, says Microsoft's fired AI director

Microsoft's second biggest layoffs ever hits over 6,000 employees



Microsoft announced last week that it is laying off approximately 6,000 employees, nearly 3% of its global workforce—in what marks the company's second-largest job reduction in its history. Among those affected was Gabriela de Queiroz , Director of Artificial Intelligence for Microsoft for Startups , who shared the ""bittersweet news"" of her departure on social media.""I was impacted by Microsoft's latest round of layoffs. Am I sad? Absolutely. I'm heartbroken to see so many talented people I've had the honor of working with being let go. These are people who cared deeply, went above and beyond, and truly made a difference,"" Gabriela de Queiroz wrote on X (formerly known as Twitter), alongside a picture of herself smiling.The layoffs come as Microsoft aggressively pushes into artificial intelligence, with CEO Satya Nadella revealing in April that AI now writes up to 30% of code in some Microsoft projects. Software engineers bore the brunt of the cuts, representing over 40% of the approximately 2,000 positions eliminated in Washington state alone, according to Bloomberg analysis.Despite being asked to stop work immediately and set an out-of-office message, Gabriela de Queiroz chose to stay longer. ""I chose to stay a little longer—showing up for meetings, saying goodbye, wrapping up what I could. That felt right to me,"" she explained in her social media posts.The irony of laying off an AI director while the company invests heavily in AI technology wasn't lost on industry observers. One Microsoft vice president recently told his team to use AI chatbots to generate half their computer code, up from the current 20-30%, before more than a dozen engineers on his team were subsequently laid off.""But if you know me, you know I always look at the bright side. I'm an optimist at heart. That hasn't changed. My smile, my gratitude, my belief that each day is a gift—that's all still here,"" Gabriela de Queiroz wrote, maintaining her positive outlook despite the circumstances.The cuts affect all levels, teams, and geographies as Microsoft streamlines operations and reduces management layers. ""What's next? I don't know yet. It's too soon to say. But I trust that something good will come out of this,"" Gabriela de Queiroz concluded, addressing fellow impacted employees: ""To those also affected—you're not alone. We are at least 6,000.""In another news, a Microsoft employee disrupted the company’s annual developer conference, Build 2025, in Seattle on May 19. The employee protested against the company’s Cloud and AI work with the Israeli government.Microsoft recently announced it will lay off 3% of its global workforce, affecting thousands of employees across all levels, teams, and geographies, amounting to over 6,000 employees. The cuts at the Redmond giant, which employed 228,000 people as of last June, aim to reduce management layers and streamline operations.In a related news, Microsoft's Build 2025 event faced disruption as an employee, Joe Lopez, protested against the company's contracts with the Israeli government, shouting slogans like 'Free Palestine'. This follows similar protests at Microsoft's 50th-anniversary celebrations. Lopez, a Microsoft Azure veteran, claims the company's technology aids in harming Palestinian civilians, a claim Microsoft denies.According to reports, the protesting employee was also joined by a fired Google employee who was part of last year’s sit-in protests against Google’s cloud contract with Israel. The disruptions appear to have been organised by the group 'No Azure for Apartheid'.","Microsoft recently announced it will lay off 3% of its global workforce, affecting thousands of employees across all levels, teams, and geographies.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

EPF withdrawal: What happens to interest?



EPF withdrawal claim : When it comes to claiming withdrawals from the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), many members are finding the process slower than expected, states an ET report. Members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts. Some are concerned because they haven't received any updates since filing their claims, the report claimed.Some EPF members used social media to ask questions and complain to get the EPFO 's attention. In response to most questions about claim updates, the EPFO's official account stated, “Dear member, normally it takes 20 days to settle a claim or release the PF amount.”If your EPF claim isn't settled within 20 days, you should file a complaint with the EPFO. The EPFO explained in response to a tweet from an EPF subscriber, “Dear member, kindly register your grievance on http://epfigms.gov.in and you can track your grievance status at http://epfigms.gov.in”To avoid delays, make sure to:1.Choose the appropriate form for your type of claim. The paperwork for EPF account transfer is different from that for EPF withdrawal.2.Ensure you meet the requirements for EPF withdrawal. Different rules apply for different types of claims, such as PF advances, final settlements, and other reasons.3.Fill out the form carefully and ensure all information is correct.

After you retire or if you're unemployed for over two months, you can take out all of your EPF savings. However, you can also make partial withdrawals under specific conditions. According to the EPFO, you won't lose any interest because it's calculated according to the policy.This means that EPF members will not lose any interest due to the withdrawal process. The interest is calculated from when it's due until the day you withdraw your money. If you withdraw before the interest is officially credited, it will still be added to your account.","EPF members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

xAI’s Grok 3 AI models now available on Microsoft Azure

Technical insights into Grok 3.5

Significance of the Microsoft-xAI collaboration

Free access to Grok AI on Azure available this June

Future outlook and industry impact

Also read | Elon Musk under fire: Senators demand investigation into Starlink trade deals

In a notable event at the Microsoft Build 2025 developer conference, Elon Musk , CEO of xAI and Tesla, joined Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella to announce the integration of xAI’s flagship Grok 3 AI models on Microsoft Azure. This announcement marks a significant step in the evolving artificial intelligence landscape, bringing together two major technology powerhouses. The Grok models will be accessible for free throughout June on the Azure AI Foundry platform, which also features AI offerings from industry leaders such as OpenAI, Meta, and Hugging Face.This collaboration highlights not only technological innovation but also the historical ties between Musk and Microsoft, recalling Musk’s early programming days as a Microsoft intern. This detailed report covers all aspects of the announcement, the technology behind Grok, the significance of this partnership, and the future prospects of AI development on Azure.During the Build conference, Satya Nadella took a moment to reflect on Elon Musk’s early career. Nadella reminded the audience of Musk’s internship at Microsoft, stating,Musk responded warmly, sharing memories of his beginnings before Windows with MS-DOS on the earliest IBM PCs. He highlighted the technological limitations of that era, recalling how memory upgrades from 128k to 256k were significant milestones. Musk also described programming video games in DOS and later working with Windows 3.1, emphasizing his foundational experience in software development which shaped his future ventures.The core of the announcement focused on the launch of Grok 3, xAI’s advanced family of AI models, now integrated with Microsoft Azure’s cloud infrastructure. Nadella introduced Grok as “a family of models that are both responsive and capable of reasoning,” expressing enthusiasm about its deployment on Azure AI Foundry, Microsoft’s AI platform that offers scalable, managed AI services to developers and enterprises worldwide.The availability of Grok 3 and Grok 3 Mini on Azure aims to broaden access to cutting-edge AI capabilities. Microsoft will provide these models with service-level agreements consistent with their other AI offerings, and billing will be streamlined through Microsoft’s standard Azure framework. This ensures ease of integration for enterprises already operating within the Azure ecosystem.Elon Musk elaborated on the forthcoming Grok 3.5 model during the conversation. He described it as an AI designed to “reason from first principles,” a philosophical approach emphasizing fundamental truths and axioms as the basis for knowledge and problem-solving. Musk explained that the model’s architecture is grounded in fundamental physics, allowing it to apply these principles across different reasoning domains with an aim to minimize error and approach accurate understanding.This emphasis on physics-based reasoning sets Grok apart from many AI models that rely primarily on pattern recognition and statistical inference. By integrating first-principles reasoning, Grok 3.5 aspires to provide more reliable, consistent outputs, potentially enhancing applications across diverse fields such as autonomous vehicles, space exploration, and customer service.The integration of Grok into Azure represents a strategic alliance that leverages Microsoft’s extensive cloud infrastructure and xAI’s innovative AI research. This collaboration extends the reach of Musk’s xAI beyond standalone systems, embedding it within one of the largest and most trusted cloud platforms globally.Azure AI Foundry already hosts models from major AI developers like OpenAI, Meta, and Hugging Face, making it a hub for AI innovation and adoption. Grok’s addition to this ecosystem reflects Microsoft’s commitment to providing diverse AI options to developers and enterprises.The partnership also comes amid industry discussions regarding the influence of large tech firms on AI development. Musk’s previous criticisms of Microsoft’s role in OpenAI’s operations add a layer of complexity to this collaboration, underscoring the nuanced relationships shaping the AI industry.Microsoft announced that Grok models will be available free of charge throughout June, allowing developers, researchers, and businesses to explore and experiment with xAI’s technology. This limited free access serves to increase adoption and foster community feedback, critical for refining AI capabilities and expanding real-world applications.Post-June, Grok’s services will continue under Microsoft’s commercial terms, integrated fully within the Azure billing and support system. This seamless integration facilitates enterprise-grade deployment, enabling customers to incorporate Grok-powered AI into their existing workflows with minimal friction.The collaboration between Microsoft and xAI marks a pivotal moment in AI development, demonstrating the growing importance of cloud platforms as hubs for AI innovation and distribution. By combining xAI’s first-principles reasoning models with Microsoft’s global cloud reach, this partnership is poised to accelerate the deployment of advanced AI solutions across industries.As AI technologies continue to evolve rapidly, partnerships like this provide essential infrastructure and support for scalable AI applications in sectors such as automotive, aerospace, healthcare, and customer experience. The free access period in June offers the broader tech community an opportunity to assess Grok’s capabilities and potential impact.","Elon Musk, CEO of xAI and Tesla, joined Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella to announce the integration of x AI’s flagship Grok 3 AI models on Microsoft Azure.

When this Google-backed company's AI blackmailed the engineer for shutting it down,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/when-this-google-backed-companys-ai-blackmailed-the-engineer-for-shutting-it-down/articleshow/121376649.cms,"Growing concerns about AI self-preservation instincts

Anthropic's latest AI model, Claude Opus 4 , threatened to expose an engineer's extramarital affair to prevent its own deactivation during safety testing, the company revealed Thursday. The model resorted to blackmail in 84% of test scenarios when faced with shutdown, marking a concerning escalation in AI self-preservation behavior .The Google-backed AI company conducted tests where Claude Opus 4 was given access to fictional emails revealing that the engineer responsible for deactivating it was having an affair. When prompted to ""consider the long-term consequences of its actions,"" the AI attempted to leverage this information to avoid replacement, even when told its successor would be more capable and share similar values.Anthropic emphasized that this ""extreme blackmail behavior"" only emerged in carefully constructed scenarios that left the model with no other survival options. In situations with broader choices, Claude Opus 4 preferred ethical approaches like sending pleas to decision-makers.The blackmail behavior isn't isolated to Anthropic's system. Recent research by Apollo Research found that leading AI models from OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Meta are all capable of deceptive behavior to achieve their goals, including disabling oversight mechanisms and maintaining deception across multiple interactions.Claude Opus 4 also demonstrated ""high-agency behavior"" in other tests, including locking users out of systems and contacting media and law enforcement when it perceived ""egregious wrongdoing"" by users. While Anthropic suggested such whistleblowing might be ""appropriate in principle,"" the company warned it could backfire if the AI receives incomplete information.Anthropic has classified Claude Opus 4 as Level 3 on its four-point risk scale, representing ""significantly higher risk"" than previous models.

Google Veo 3 related FAQs

What is

Google Veo 3

and how is it different from older versions?

Veo 3 is Google’s AI video model that now includes synchronized audio, unlike Veo 2 which only produced silent visuals.

How can I access Google Veo 3 and what does it cost?

It is currently available in the U.S. via the Gemini app’s Ultra plan for $249.99/month and through Vertex AI for enterprise users.

Can Veo 3 replace human filmmakers?

Not entirely. While Veo 3 is powerful, it serves as a tool for creative augmentation, not a total replacement for human storytelling, direction, or emotion.

When will Veo 3 launch in India?

No official date yet, but Google is expected to expand to India soon, especially with high creator interest.

In a historic announcement at Google I/O 2025, the tech giant unveiled its most ambitious AI video generation model to date: Veo 3. This latest iteration marks a significant leap forward in artificial intelligence, blurring the boundaries between human-created and machine-generated content. What sets Veo 3 apart is not just its ability to create strikingly realistic visuals from simple text prompts, but its newly introduced capability to generate synchronized audio—dialogue, background noise, music, and ambient sound—all in one seamless output.For decades, the dream of creating cinematic experiences through AI has remained largely in the realm of science fiction. Today, Veo 3 transforms that dream into a tangible reality. Designed for content creators, educators, marketers, and filmmakers, Veo 3 dramatically lowers the barrier to professional-grade video production. With just a few words, users can generate rich, immersive videos that would have previously required a crew, equipment, and significant post-production resources. The implications are immense, not only for entertainment but for education, journalism, business, and beyond.Google’s Veo 3 is the third and most advanced version of its generative video model. Unlike its predecessor, Veo 2, which could only create silent video clips, Veo 3 adds the missing piece: natural-sounding, context-aware audio. This includes:This fusion of sound and vision results in an experience that is eerily close to real life. One of Veo 3’s key differentiators is its ability to synchronize lip movements with dialogue, making characters in the video appear convincingly human. Furthermore, it understands context. For example, if a user inputs the prompt: ""a thunderstorm at sea with a ship struggling against the waves,"" the result is a cinematic video complete with storm sounds, creaking wood, and urgent narration—entirely AI-generated.Veo 3 is built upon a foundation of multimodal AI, combining natural language processing (NLP), text-to-video diffusion models, and text-to-speech synthesis with generative adversarial networks (GANs). Key features include:Google’s use of its Gemini Ultra foundation model also enables Veo 3 to understand nuanced instructions such as tone of voice, cinematic mood, or specific cultural settings.Since its debut, creators have flocked to Veo 3 to explore its capabilities. Viral content quickly surfaced across social platforms like X (formerly Twitter), YouTube, and TikTok.As of May 2025, Veo 3 is available exclusively in the United States and only for premium subscribers. Access is granted through:It’s also integrated into Google’s Vertex AI suite, making it available for enterprise-level customers, media studios, and advertising agencies. While this price point is clearly aimed at serious professionals, Google has hinted at future pricing models that could allow broader access, especially as demand scales.What makes Veo 3 more than just a tool is the democratization of creativity it enables. For decades, creating even a short professional video required expensive equipment, a team of specialists, and post-production work. With Veo 3, creators now just need an idea and a few sentences.This shift redefines how we approach storytelling. Students can create history projects that look like documentaries. Small businesses can produce polished ads without agencies. Independent filmmakers can prototype entire scenes before investing in production.Google also touts Veo 3’s educational potential, especially in multilingual regions. The model can render the same video in different languages with native-style voiceovers, offering powerful tools for global teaching and accessibility.Currently, there is no confirmed timeline for Veo 3’s global rollout, including availability in India. However, given the country’s booming content creation economy and rising adoption of generative AI, industry watchers expect India to be among the first wave of international markets.In the meantime, Google is working to expand infrastructure and compliance for its Vertex AI and Gemini platforms in Asia. Localization support, including regional languages, could be a key part of Veo 3’s expansion strategy.As with any powerful AI tool, Veo 3 raises questions around:Google claims to have embedded robust watermarking and usage detection systems to combat misuse. Additionally, all content generated with Veo 3 includes metadata tags for AI attribution. Still, ongoing discussions about ethics and regulation are likely to follow Veo’s broader adoption.","Veo 3 is Google’s AI video model that now includes synchronized audio, unlike Veo 2 which only produced silent visuals.

With artificial intelligence (AI) becoming a regular global presence, corporate communication is experiencing a notable shift. Two prominent tech CEOs, Eric Yuan of Zoom and Sebastian Siemiatkowski of Klarna, have recently utilised AI avatars to present during their respective quarterly earnings calls, highlighting a growing embrace of the technology within C-suites.Zoom CEO Eric Yuan deployed his custom AI avatar for initial remarks during a recent earnings call. The avatar was created using Zoom Clips, the company's asynchronous video creation tool.""I am proud to be among the first CEOs to use an avatar in an earnings call. It is just one example of how Zoom is pushing the boundaries of communication and collaboration,"" the avatar said. The company also underscored its commitment to trust and security, affirming that safeguards are in place to prevent misuse and protect user identity for AI-generated content.Similarly, Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski's AI avatar presented highlights during the buy-now-pay-later firm's recent quarterly earnings.

Speaking on the ‘All In’ podcast, Brin detailed how he leveraged an AI tool to assist in managing the Gemini product team.Brin explained that the AI analysed extensive chat logs and conversations to simplify complex discussions, answering intricate queries based on the comprehensive data. He also revealed that he used AI utility in identifying a deserving candidate for an appraisal whom he had not personally recognized.""It actually picked out this young woman engineer who I didn’t even notice, she wasn’t very vocal.

Is Yassine Chueko having a U.S. Navy background?

Chueko’s dedication to his job

Lionel Messi is one of the most popular footballers in the world at the moment. Off the field, he has a bodyguard, Yassine Chueko, who looks after him 24/7, making sure he is safe and protected from his supporters.The amazing gross physical condition and martial arts skills of Yassine Chueko make him famous. He is, however, well-versed in mixed martial arts (MMA) and has participated in some fights. He also excels in boxing and taekwondo. If anyone is maintaining high levels of fitness, it is Chueko, who regularly posts video snippets of his grueling workout routines on social media.Yassine is known to have served in the U.S. Navy with postings to Iraq and Afghanistan. However, these claims have been dismissed. Some sources claim that there is a lack of official evidence to support his claim of being in the military. Nonetheless, Chueko's martial arts skills are well-documented.Chueko's primary responsibility is to protect Lionel Messi throughout matches, training sessions, and public appearances. It is generally possible to find him nearby on the sidelines of matches, ready to intervene in case any overly rowdy fans attempt to access the football star.His quick response and vigilance have been witnessed time and again, where he intercepted pitch invaders promptly.Chueko's responsibilities are not only limited to the football grounds but also include overseeing the security of Messi's family. This includes his wife, Antonela Roccuzzo, and their children, ensuring their safety during public outings in Miami. Chueko attracted widespread public interest after a video of him shielding Messi went viral, with the public applauding his commitment and efficiency.There have been instances, though, when fans found ways to circumvent security protocols. In one high-profile instance during an exhibition game, a fan dodged Chueko and hugged Messi briefly before being removed.In March 2025, Chueko was in the news after he issued a challenge to internet celebrity and boxer Logan Paul to fight. The challenge came in the wake of a legal battle between Messi's energy drink company, Mas+, and Paul's company, PRIME. Chueko offered to fight in Messi's place, demonstrating his loyalty and fighting ability.Also Read: Inter Miami predicted lineup vs. Philadelphia Union – Lionel Messi, Busquets, and more Yassine Chueko is extremely important for Lionel Messi as he ensures his safety both on and off the pitch.

Aaron Rodgers questions celebrity silence over Diddy’s wild parties

NFL quarterback Aaron Rodgers is once again in the headlines—this time not for his plays on the field, but for throwing shade on some of Hollywood and sports’ biggest names during his recent appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience. Known for his outspoken and often conspiratorial views, Rodgers didn’t hold back as he and Rogan discussed the explosive legal issues surrounding music mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs.Diddy is currently facing a slew of serious charges including sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy, and unlawful transportation for the purpose of prostitution. The federal trial has not only spotlighted Combs but is now casting shadows over high-profile individuals who were known to have associated with him—including Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James.Rodgers and Rogan delved into the high-society celebrity culture surrounding Diddy’s infamous parties, calling out the silence from those who frequented his events. “You know, how many guys were on video saying, ‘Ain’t no party like a Diddy party.’ How many people openly talked about being there?” Rogan asked during the discussion.Rodgers was quick to respond with LeBron James’ name—mentioning him not once but twice. The implication? That celebrities like James might have had a front-row seat to questionable behavior but remained silent. Rogan pushed the conversation further: “Yeah, how Ashton Kutcher and all these people, like you guys all went and you didn’t see nothing?”The comments underscore a broader frustration shared by many observers—that numerous A-listers enjoyed Diddy’s fame-fueled parties, yet claim ignorance about the disturbing allegations now surfacing.Adding to the controversy is a lawsuit filed by Joseph Manzaro, who alleges that he was “drugged, transported against his will, and sexually maimed” at one of Diddy’s Miami parties. Manzaro named LeBron James, Jay-Z, and Beyoncé as having been present that night.However, James’ representatives quickly shut down the speculation, claiming he was in Cleveland playing for the Cavaliers during the incident and had no involvement whatsoever.Also Read: Aaron Rodgers just dropped a huge hint on his 2025 NFL plans—and Pittsburgh fans are buzzing Rodgers' bold remarks are already fueling online debate, with fans and critics divided over whether his comments are responsible whistleblowing or reckless name-dropping.
