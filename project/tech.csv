With projects that earn him between $3-5 million each, his Hollywood portfolio now forms a major chunk of his net worth.His ability to balance action roles with comedic and family-friendly projects has made him one of the most versatile stars to come out of WWE.Beyond wrestling and acting, Cena’s portfolio includes endorsement deals with brands like Hefty, Experian, Honda, and Crocs. These campaigns reportedly bring in $15 million annually, thanks to his clean-cut image and mass appeal.He’s also made savvy investments in fitness tech, digital platforms, and real estate in Florida and California. Combined, these assets add significant long-term value to his overall wealth.Importantly, Cena's philanthropic work - particularly with the Make-A-Wish Foundation, has enhanced his reputation globally.

Kylie Kelce reveals the one hilarious condition Jason must meet before she lets him move out



Kylie Kelce is keeping things real—and hilariously relatable—when it comes to navigating life at home with four young daughters and a retired NFL husband. During her candid appearance on the Not Skinny But Not Fat podcast with Amanda Hirsch, the 33-year-old podcaster and mother-of-four didn’t hold back in sharing how wild things could get at home, especially as her girls grow older.In a lighthearted moment that had both fans and the host cracking up, Kylie revealed that she has given Jason Kelce , her husband of seven years, permission to move out—on one specific condition. “I told Jason he’s allowed to move out as long as he visits me,” she quipped during the chat, which aired on Tuesday, April 22, on podcast platforms and drops Wednesday on YouTube.Kylie elaborated on the tongue-in-cheek statement by adding, “As soon as we’re all synced up, I’m like, ‘You can move out, but you have to visit me.’” Her comment references the well-known occurrence where women living together may find their menstrual cycles aligning—a phenomenon that, while debated scientifically, is widely recognized in pop culture.With four daughters at home—Wyatt, 5, Elliotte, 4, Bennett, 2, and newborn Finnley—the Kelce household is understandably bustling with energy and unpredictability. Kylie jokingly expressed her sympathy for Jason, knowing how intense things could get. “I just feel bad. I know what our house was like when both my sister and I were like synced up and like yeah, God,” she admitted to Hirsch.While her remarks were clearly made in jest, Kylie’s openness offered a funny but telling glimpse into the dynamic of a home where a strong woman leads with love, wit, and a good sense of humor. Though Jason Kelce recently retired from the NFL, he’s clearly still on active duty when it comes to parenting—something Kylie appreciates, even if she occasionally suggests he might need a breather.Beyond the jokes, the podcast also touched on their daughters’ growing preferences. Kylie revealed some of the kids already favor their dad over her in certain situations, adding another layer to the playful family dynamic.Ultimately, Kylie Kelce’s remarks may have been rooted in humor, but they showcase a relatable reality: parenting can be chaos, and finding laughter in the madness might just be the key to keeping the household running smoothly. And if Jason ever does take up that offer to “move out,” it’s safe to say he won’t be gone for long.Also Read: A perfect balance of mystery and warmth, why Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are the ideal 'Black Cat' and 'Golden Retriever' duo",Kylie Kelce jokingly sets one condition for Jason Kelce’s freedom.

GTA 6 Crypto Rumor: Could you get paid in Bitcoin in GTA 6? Here’s the real story behind the crypto rumor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/esports/gta/could-you-get-paid-in-bitcoin-in-gta-6-heres-the-real-story-behind-the-crypto-rumor/articleshow/120391964.cms,"Source: Rockstar Games

Crypto payments in GTA 6? The rumor started with fan hype and streamers



Adin Ross Is Making GTA 6 Crypto Coin

Mods and RP servers might still make it happen even if Rockstar doesn’t

Just when we thought the GTA 6 rumor machine couldn’t go any harder, here comes the internet with another banger: cryptocurrency in Grand Theft Auto. That’s right, players are now convinced they might get rewarded in Bitcoin-style crypto while causing mayhem in Vice City. And honestly, it sounds so wild it almost fits the GTA vibe. But is it real? Is Rockstar actually building a crypto-based payout system into its most hyped game ever? Or is this just another fan fantasy spiraling out of control? Let’s break it down.The idea that you might earn cryptocurrency while playing GTA 6 has been gaining serious traction. Over the past few months, fans have speculated about Rockstar potentially adding a crypto-based currency system, or even letting players earn rewards in digital tokens.One of the more viral sparks came from Adin Ross, the controversial streamer known for his GTA RP content, who claimed he’s working on a crypto-integrated GTA 6 roleplay server . That got people thinking: if GTA RP can do it, maybe Rockstar's next big game will too?The rumor really exploded when a few fan tweets and Discord screenshots mentioned a fictional in-game currency called $RSTAR, supposedly being tested in development. That was all it took for the community to lose it.Even though $RSTAR isn’t real at least not yet it’s become a fan-favorite idea. According to speculation, it would be an in-game cryptocurrency you could earn by completing heists or trading within GTA 6’s open world. Think of it like a modern parody of Bitcoin, built right into the satirical fabric of the game.As of now, Rockstar Games has made zero official comments about crypto being part of GTA 6. In fact, their track record suggests the opposite. Back in 2022, Rockstar actually banned crypto and NFTs from all GTA Online servers, citing their policies against monetization through blockchain-based assets.Here’s where things get interesting. Even if GTA 6 doesn’t launch with any kind of official crypto system, modders and RP creators like Adin Ross could absolutely build it themselves. Custom RP servers have already added NFT characters, gambling systems, and fake crypto trading into their GTA Online worlds.So yeah, maybe you won’t be cashing out actual Bitcoin from GTA 6 but fan-run servers might still give you that experience. Just don’t expect it in the vanilla version of the game.Also read - GTA VI might melt your PC: Here’s what you’ll actually need to run Rockstar’s next-gen beast","The idea that you might earn cryptocurrency while playing GTA 6 has been gaining serious traction.

Sandberg and Zuckerberg's discussions about acquiring Instagram for $1 billion were also highlighted. Zuckerberg admitted TikTok surpasses Facebook and Instagram's user base, acknowledging it as a major competitive threat despite Meta's efforts with Reels.

Former Meta Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg took the stand in federal court Wednesday, revealing that Meta had considered blocking advertisements from potential competitors on its Facebook platform. This testimony bolsters the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) argument that the social media giant employed such strategies to stifle emerging rivals.During questioning by FTC lawyer Susan Musser, Sandberg addressed internal discussions between herself and CEO Mark Zuckerberg regarding this advertising strategy. This marked Sandberg's first appearance in court since the trial began.The trial also shed light on private communications between Sandberg and Zuckerberg during their deliberations over acquiring Instagram for $1 billion. In a text exchange from the spring of 2012, Zuckerberg questioned Sandberg about the hefty price tag, asking, ""Do you think it's way too much?"" Sandberg responded, ""Yes of course it's way too much."" When later asked by a Meta lawyer if she still held that view, Sandberg admitted, ""I think I was wrong. I think I was very wrong.""Earlier in the day, Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg made his third court appearance in as many days. His testimony focused on Meta's intense efforts over the past four years to compete with the Chinese-owned video-sharing app TikTok. Zuckerberg described TikTok as one of the most significant ""competitive threats for Instagram and Facebook.""Under questioning from a Meta attorney, Zuckerberg emphasized that Meta actively competes with TikTok and, in many respects, trails behind in the current social media landscape. This line of questioning aimed to weaken the FTC's claim that Meta holds a monopoly in the social media market.Zuckerberg acknowledged that Reels, Meta's short-form video feature designed to rival TikTok, was ""pretty good."" However, he quickly pointed out that TikTok's user base surpasses the combined user bases of both Facebook and Instagram. ""And I don't like it when our competitors do better than us,"" Zuckerberg stated.",Sheryl Sandberg took the stand in federal court Wednesday.

TOI Correspondent from London:

Over the years, patrons of Britain’s oldest Indian restaurant, ‘Veeraswamy’, have included Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Charlie Chaplin, Winston Churchill, Marlon Brando, Sharon Stone and David Cameron.A haunt of Indian maharajas and European royalty too, the King of Denmark even shipped out a cask of Carlsberg for staff to store for whenever he dined there.Now the Michelin-starred restaurant , which opened in 1926 on Regent Street, London, and today serves pineapple curry and chicken makhana au vin, is at threat of closure as the Crown Estate (property portfolio owned by King Charles), which owns Victory House, the building in which the restaurant is based, is refusing to renew its lease, which expires in June.The Crown Estate claims it needs to take the restaurant space back to extend the ground floor reception for offices on the building’s upper floors. Knocking through into Veeraswamy would give it an extra 11 sq mts.Veeraswamy’s founder, Edward Palmer, was the great-grandson of General William Palmer, and his wife, Begum Faiz Baksh, a Mughal princess. Gen Palmer was private secretary to Warren Hastings, first governor-general of the Presidency of Fort William. It was acquired by Ranjit Mathrani and Namita Panjabi in 1996.“Had they wanted to, they could’ve easily put the office reception on the first floor. I think they’ve come to the view that it’s too tiresome having a restaurant there, they want it to be all offices,” Mathrani (81), told the Times of London.If the Crown Estate refuses to allow the restaurant to stay put until he finds and fit out an alternative space, with its iconic décor inspired by the art nouveau of the 1920s and maharaja’s palaces, the restaurant will have to close, leading to possible redundancies and loss of business until a new site is found.Mathrani is taking the Crown Estate to court.A spokesperson for The Crown Estate told TOI: “The Crown Estate has a duty to generate value for the nation, while acting as responsible stewards for this historic part of London. We need to carry out a comprehensive refurbishment of Victory House. This includes a major upgrade to the offices and improving the entrance to make it more accessible. Due to the limited options available in this listed building we need to remove the entrance to the restaurant, which means we will not be able to offer Veeraswamy an extension when their lease expires.”","Michelin-starred restaurant Veeraswamy opened in 1926 on Regent Street, London.

As the Catholic Church begins the solemn and complex transition following the death of Pope Francis, centuries-old rituals and roles come into focus.The process, steeped in history and tradition, involves a series of defined steps and offices.Here's a guide to the key terms and roles shaping the transition.The camerlengo, or chamberlain, is the cardinal responsible for formally confirming the pope’s death, sealing his residence, and administering the Vatican’s temporal goods until a new pontiff is elected.Irish-born American Cardinal Kevin Farrell currently holds this role.The College of Cardinals, currently composed of 252 members, takes charge during this interregnum. Of them, 135 are under the age of 80 and eligible to vote in the conclave. As per AP, 108 of these cardinal electors were appointed by Pope Francis.The conclave, which must begin within 20 days of a pope’s death or resignation, is a secretive meeting of the cardinal electors held inside the Sistine Chapel. Its name, Latin for “with a key”, reflects the tradition of sequestering the cardinals until a decision is reached. Only one of their own may be chosen and a two-thirds majority is required.Italian Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, the current dean of the College of Cardinals, presides over the conclave, administers oaths, and announces the pope’s death to the Church. Upon election, he asks the chosen pope whether he accepts and what name he will take.The cardinals stay at Domus Santa Marta, a Vatican guesthouse. Unusually, Pope Francis chose to live there throughout his papacy instead of the Apostolic Palace.Once the Sistine Chapel doors close, the words “Extra omnes” (Latin for “all out”) are spoken by Archbishop Diego Ravelli, asking everyone but the electors to leave so voting can begin.Each pope receives the Fisherman’s Ring, symbolising his role as successor to St Peter, the “fisher of men.” Once a pope dies, the ring is not destroyed as before, but marked to prevent misuse.The General Congregations are meetings of all cardinals before the conclave to discuss Church matters in secrecy. Meanwhile, the terms scrutineers, infirmarii, and revisers refer to cardinals chosen by lot to count votes, assist sick electors, and verify ballots, respectively.When a new pope is elected, the protodeacon, currently French Cardinal Dominique Mamberti, announces “Habemus Papam” (“We have a pope”) from the balcony of St Peter’s Basilica.Pope Francis' own motto, “Miserando atque eligendo” (Latin for “having had mercy and choosing him”), was derived from the homilies of St Bede and reflects his pastoral philosophy.The rogito is a written summary of the deceased pope’s life, placed in his coffin. His burial will not be at St Peter’s, but at St Mary Major—a departure from tradition. In his will, Francis requested a plain tomb near the icon of Salus Populi Romani, which he held dear.The sede vacante, or “vacant seat,” marks the period between pontificates. During this time, the Church is governed by the rules in the Universi Dominici Gregis, a document issued by St John Paul II and later amended by Pope Benedict XVI to preserve the two-thirds majority rule throughout voting.Finally, the world learns of the outcome through either black or white smoke rising from the Sistine Chapel chimney. Black smoke signals no decision, while white smoke, and the tolling of bells, announces that a new pope has been chosen.","The College of Cardinals, currently composed of 252 members, takes charge during this interregnum.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

A research team has uncovered a key reason behind Google’s dominance in web searches: Most users haven’t seriously tried alternatives, according to a study cited by Bloomberg. The researchers found that Google’s popularity stems partly from a belief in its superiority, akin to preferring a favorite soda, even if untested options might compare favorably.The study, conducted by academics from Stanford University, the University of Pennsylvania, and MIT, showed that Google’s grip on search habits can be loosened with incentives, such as paying users to try alternatives like Microsoft Bing. This finding is influencing a trial that began Monday to address Google’s illegal search monopoly, as ruled last year, Bloomberg reports. Google plans to appeal the decision.In the experiment, nearly 2,500 participants were monitored for months, with some paid $10 to use Bing instead of Google for two weeks. After payments stopped, 78% reverted to Google, but 22% stuck with Bing, surprising researchers. “I realized Bing was not as bad as I thought it was,” one participant said, per Bloomberg. Assistant professor Leon Musolff from the University of Pennsylvania told Bloomberg the results suggest users’ belief in Google’s unmatched quality persists because few explore alternatives.The study, which didn’t test other search engines, informed legal strategies in the Google case. Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, leading states that sued Google alongside the Justice Department, cited the research in proposing a court-ordered consumer campaign to promote search alternatives, including “short-term incentive payments,” the report notes.The government also seeks broader remedies, like forcing Google to sell Chrome.Google argues its search engine’s dominance reflects superior innovation and user choice, not coercion. It highlighted the study’s finding that defaulting users to Bing would reduce “consumer surplus,” implying dissatisfaction, per Bloomberg. However, the researchers proposed a two-step solution: nudge users to try alternatives temporarily, then let them choose. They estimated Google would still capture 75% of searches, down from 90% in 2020 data.Google has lost all three major U.S. monopoly lawsuits—covering search, ad tech, and its Android app store—and plans to appeal, Bloomberg reports. The researchers’ findings suggest that breaking Google’s hold may require unconventional measures, like incentives, to reshape a market shaped by monopolistic practices.","Researchers found that Google’s popularity stems partly from a belief in its superiority.

What the Kardashians said about Lauren Sanchez’s Blue Origin space flight



“This is a really unique experience and we’re just so honored to be here to support them and watch this amazing part of history, and I’m so proud of her,”

How Sanchez solved NASA's 'uniform problem' before her Blue Origin flight



Amazon founder Jeff Bezos ' fiancée, Lauren Sánchez, received a space-themed gift from Kris Jenner, Kim Kardashian, and Khloé Kardashian after her recent Blue Origin Space flight. The Kardashians gave Sanchez a Judith Leiber handbag shaped like an UFO, valued at $6,995 (approx. Rs 5.9 lakh). The UFO Orbiter bag features star-shaped and geometric crystals, aligning with the theme of the Blue Orgin's Space flight. Sánchez shared the gift on her Instagram story (seen by Page Six), describing it as “Out of this world!” and tagged the three Kardashian sisters. The gift came shortly after this week’s all-women Blue Origin space flight, which Sánchez helped organise alongside Bezos through his Blue Origin initiative.Kris Jenner and Khloé Kardashian visited Van Horn, Texas, earlier this week to support Lauren Sánchez during her all-female Blue Origin spaceflight.Jenner said about Sánchez.Khloé Kardashian also shared her thoughts, saying the family is proud of “all of the female astronauts,” referring to the rest of the crew that included: Katy Perry, Gayle King, Aisha Bowe, Amanda Nguyen and Kerianne Flynn.Ahead of her Blue Origin flight, Sánchez emphasized the importance of designing better-fitting spacesuits for women.

AI moves closer to becoming a true partner in scientific exploration



Hassabis highlights key issues that AI may pose



Growing role of AI in medicine and healthcare

Sir Demis Hassabis, co-founder of Google DeepMind and a knighted British AI pioneer, isn't breaking ground in AI or cracking the codes of protein structures, he's playing intellectual games like chess and poker. Even after cracking the code of life's most profound secrets, Hassabis continues to be fueled by an unquenchable thirst for humanity's deepest secrets. His relentless drive has not only reshaped the fields of artificial intelligence and biology, but it could also signal the dawn of the end of human disease.According to the ET reports, in a CBS 60 minute interview on artificialintelligencenews.in (Instagram) with Scott Pelley, Hassabis shared an insight that it sounds more like science fiction than science fact. He also boldly forecasted that AI can eradicate all illnesses in the coming decade. ""It takes, on average, ten years and billions of dollars to develop just one drug,"" Hassabis told us. ""We could maybe reduce that down to months, or even weeks."" His remarks are a manifestation of his sheer confidence in AI's ability to transform medicine.The credibility of Hassabis in coming up with such broad statements lies in his career in cracking the code of protein structures—the very fabric of life. In an incredible feat, DeepMind's artificial intelligence model unraveled the secrets of over 200 million protein structures in a span of just one year. Previous to this AI breakthrough, only a paltry 1% of these structures had been unraveled, each taking years of laborious effort. This innovation has opened the door to equivalent developments in the field of drug discovery, which could accelerate the identification of life-saving drugs by decades.While current AI systems remain constrained by limitations in curiosity and intuition, Hassabis envisions a future where AI doesn’t just solve scientific problems—it identifies them. “In the next five to ten years,” he predicts, “we’ll have systems that are capable of coming up with new hypotheses in science on their own.” This kind of innovation marks a turning point in scientific discovery, shifting the role of AI from a tool to a co-discoverer.Hassabis' research in the realm of AI has already led him and his research partner, John Jumper, to win the esteemed 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry as a recognition for their work on AI-based protein structure prediction. Their research has unveiled new realms in both medicine and biology and paved the way for AI to achieve historic progress in every area of science. Hassabis is convinced that AI will rapidly develop to the stage where it can provide novel, creative ideas—bringing humanity closer to an era of ""radical abundance"" and a disease-free world.Yet Hassabis is not oblivious to the risks that AI may pose. He recognizes two key issues: the abuse of AI by harmful actors and the difficulty of keeping AI aligned with human values. ""Can we ensure they remain on the guardrails? "" he asks, using the terms of safety systems necessary to handle autonomous AI systems.In his dual capacity as the UK Government's AI Advisor and a DeepMind and Isomorphic Labs leader, Hassabis is not just defining the future of AI research but also shaping policy to ensure that AI's power is exercised safely and for the good of humanity.Sir Demis Hassabis occupies a special position of intersection between scientific insight and technological innovation. His precocity as a child genius has transformed into cutting-edge work that is remapping the boundaries of AI and medicine. His forecasts are informed by established advancements, not science fiction. At a time when the world is grappling with novel challenges such as pandemics, healthcare inequalities, and increasing medical expenses, Hassabis' future vision of disease eradication with the help of AI is an exhilarating and revolutionary potentiality.The potential of AI in Medicine AI is already changing healthcare in the present day. Artificial intelligence-powered tools are improving diagnostics, speeding up drug discovery, and tailoring patient treatment. AI technologies now aid clinicians in reading medical images, detecting diseases like cancer and sepsis, and making real-time therapy choices. In the COVID-19 crisis, AI-enabled systems played a critical role in tracking patients and performing screening procedures.","Sir Demis Hassabis is the co-founder of Google DeepMind and a knighted British AI pioneer.

How antitrust case against Google may hurt company’s AI products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-antitrust-case-against-google-may-hurt-companys-ai-products/articleshow/120517731.cms,"Google says AI products fall outside the current case purview

Google’s bet on artificial intelligence (AI) may be under threat as the US Department of Justice (DOJ) has argued that Google’s alleged dominance in online search poses a significant threat to fair competition in the flourishing AI market. A DOJ attorney asserted that without stringent measures, the tech giant could leverage its AI products to further establish its search monopoly.According to news agency Reuters, DOJ attorney David Dahlquist is pushing for remedies designed to foster competition in the evolving search environment, particularly as it increasingly intersects with generative AI products such as ChatGPT.“This court's remedy should be forward-looking and not ignore what is on the horizon,” Dahlquist said, adding that Google's established search monopoly provides an unfair advantage in the development and improvement of its AI products.Conversely, these AI products can also serve as a strategic avenue to funnel users back to its dominant search engine, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of market control, he added.Countering the DOJ's arguments, Google's lawyer, John Schmidtlein, dismissed the proposed remedies as “a wishlist for competitors looking to get the benefits of Google's extraordinary innovations.” He argued that AI competitors are “competing just fine” and are seeking “handouts.”AI competitors “would like handouts as well even though they are competing just fine,” he said.Google contends that its AI products fall outside the purview of the current antitrust case, which primarily focuses on traditional search engines.In a blog post published on Sunday, Google executive Lee-Anne Mulholland asserted that adopting the proposed remedies “would hold back American innovation at a critical juncture.”Antitrust enforcers have put forward a series of potentially transformative measures aimed at rapidly opening up the search market and providing a competitive edge to newcomers. These proposals include terminating Google's exclusive default search agreements with major tablet and smartphone manufacturers like Apple.","US Department of Justice argues that Google's dominance in online search poses a significant threat to fair competition in the flourishing AI market.

Perplexity CEO says don’t breakup Google, but Android needs to open up to choices

Perplexity AI CEO Aravind Srinivas has been asked to testify in the ongoing Department of Justice antitrust case against Google, where he will advocate for consumer choice on Android while opposing the breakup of Google 's Chrome browser business.""Perplexity has been asked to testify in the Google DOJ case,"" Srinivas posted on X. ""Our core points: Google should not be broken up. Chrome should remain within and continue to be run by Google.""The testimony comes as Google faces a critical three-week hearing beginning Monday to determine penalties for operating what a federal judge ruled last year was an illegal search monopoly. The US Department of Justice is pushing for radical changes including forcing Google to sell its Chrome browser and banning exclusive search deals with companies like Apple.Srinivas believes breaking up Chrome would be counterproductive, stating, ""We don't believe anyone else can run a browser at that scale without a hit on quality, nor the business model to be able to serve that many users profitably by keeping the browser free.""Instead, Perplexity's testimony will focus on increasing consumer choice on Android devices. ""Android should become more open to consumer choice,"" Srinivas argued. ""Consumers should have the choice to pick who they want as a default search and default voice assistant, and OEMs should be able to offer consumers this choice.""In a blog post titled ""Choice is the Remedy,"" Perplexity criticized Google's restrictive contracts with phone manufacturers, stating that ""mobile companies are forced to give their customers a subpar experience that Google demands to preserve its monopoly.""Srinivas finds particularly frustrating ""how hard it is to change anything on Android.

How Nico Mueller secured the top spot

Andretti driver Nico Mueller and his race engineer Bertrand Mermine have surged to the top of the ABB Engineered to Outrun leaderboard following a dramatic Miami Grand Prix, where post-race penalties reshuffled the final standings in Mueller’s favour. Though he originally crossed the line in 10th, Mueller was promoted to 4th, thanks to a well-timed strategy and a dash of late-race chaos. His calculated decision to split Attack Mode usage proved decisive, paying off when several drivers were hit with time penalties after the chequered flag.The Engineered to Outrun leaderboard celebrates the most dynamic driver-engineer duos in Formula E—tracking those who gain the most positions during a race, with emphasis on overtaking prowess, energy management, and overall race pace. The season concludes with an award for the top-ranked pairing.After Round 5 in Miami, the leaderboard has Maserati MSG Racing’s Stoffel Vandoorne and his race engineer Thibault Arnal on number 2. Mahindra Racing’s Nyck De Vries and race engineer Tom Bayles are in third position in the ABB Engineered to Outrun leaderboard.The FIA Formula E Instagram account also shared the update, posting:“@nico.mueller51 overtaking his way up the rankings! With a mega drive from P18 to P4, the @andrettife driver tops the @abbgroup Engineered to Outrun leaderboard after Round 5. #MiamiEPrix #FormulaE #Motorsport #Racing.”Nico Mueller’s rise was the result of strategy combined with fortunate timing. While many drivers delayed activating Attack Mode until later in the race, Mueller opted for a more aggressive strategy—using two four-minute activations, starting with the first on Lap 11 to position himself within points range.By Lap 20, Mueller was running in 10th when a red flag was brought out following a three-car collision. After the restart, as the majority of the grid scrambled to use their remaining Attack Mode activations, Mueller’s earlier strategy gave him an edge.Despite finishing 10th on the road, he was ultimately classified 4th after multiple post-race penalties were issued. Drivers including Norman Nato, Robin Frijns, Oliver Rowland, Sam Bird, and Taylor Barnard were penalized 10 seconds each for misuse of Attack Mode, while Nick Cassidy received a five-second penalty for exceeding track limits.Also Read: Formula E Miami E-Prix 2025: Jake Hughes crashes at chicane, here’s how the multi-car collision changed the outcome.

Shannon Sharpe allegedly offered $10 million to settle rape claims before shocking lawsuit was filed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/shannon-sharpe-allegedly-offered-10-million-to-settle-rape-claims-before-shocking-lawsuit-was-filed/articleshow/120535271.cms,"Rape accuser’s lawyer says Shannon Sharpe wanted quiet $10 million settlement before legal blowup (Credit: Getty Images)

Lawyer reveals Shannon Sharpe nearly paid $10 million to resolve rape accusation quietly



Shannon Sharpe , the NFL Hall of Famer-turned-media personality, is at the center of a fierce legal storm after being accused of sexual assault by a woman referred to as “Jane Doe.” The lawsuit, filed in Nevada, alleges a series of disturbing incidents that occurred during what’s described as a “rocky consensual relationship.” However, the case has taken a complicated turn—both legally and publicly—as revelations of a multimillion-dollar settlement offer and claims of blackmail surface.Shannon Sharpe, through his lawyer Lanny J. Davis, has strongly denied all allegations. In a virtual press conference, Davis described the suit as a calculated move meant to exploit Sharpe's rising financial status. “It was a big surprise to us a few days ago when this case was filed,” Davis said. He emphasized that during mediation, an offer of “at least $10 million” had been made to settle the dispute quietly—an offer that was ultimately rejected.This rejection, followed by a sudden lawsuit, has fueled Sharpe’s claim that the accusation is nothing short of a “shakedown.” “Her knowledge that Mr. Sharpe’s about to receive a very lucrative contract… she knew that, took advantage of it… This is a classic definition of blackmail,” Davis asserted. Sharpe is reportedly on the brink of signing a deal exceeding $100 million for his “Club Shay Shay” podcast after his exit from Colin Cowherd’s The Volume network.In support of their narrative, Sharpe's legal team released alleged text exchanges between him and Jane Doe , aiming to paint a picture of a consensual and adult relationship that featured sexual role-playing and financial negotiations. Davis further pointed out that the accuser, who has not been publicly named by the courts but was identified by Sharpe on social media, is an active content creator on OnlyFans—a fact he cited to support the consensual nature of their interactions.In stark contrast, Jane Doe’s attorney Tony Buzbee has remained defiant. “On the one hand Mr. Sharpe and his lawyers claim that the case filed by Jane Doe is meritless, yet on the other hand they now have disclosed that Mr. Sharpe offered Jane Doe $10 million in writing not to file her lawsuit,” Buzbee wrote in a fiery Instagram statement. According to him, the plaintiff declined the offer to pursue what she believes is justice.The lawsuit alleges graphic instances of abuse, including one where the plaintiff tried to share her location with friends during a confrontation, only for Sharpe to allegedly choke her and threaten her life. “If you ever do that again, I will (expletive) kill you,” she claims he said. Another incident involved Sharpe showing up to her residence under the guise of delivering gifts but allegedly sexually assaulting her instead.These harrowing details have cast a shadow over Sharpe’s public persona, even as he continues his appearances on ESPN’s First Take. While the network has yet to comment officially, Stephen A. Smith has acknowledged the severity of the situation, noting that ESPN President Jimmy Pitaro is ""taking this matter very seriously.""What’s further complicating the narrative is Sharpe’s recent counteroffensive—announcing intentions to sue both the accuser and Buzbee for defamation. He also accused Buzbee of “targeting Black men,” referencing his involvement in lawsuits against figures like Sean “Diddy” Combs and Jay-Z.Sharpe's camp insists this is all an effort to extort money amid the backdrop of his soaring career, while Buzbee paints it as a typical defense tactic aimed at silencing survivors through character attacks. As both sides gear up for a courtroom battle, the public is left sifting through a deeply polarizing case that blends allegations of violence, fame, money, and media manipulation.While the legal process unfolds, the central question remains: is this a matter of justice, or a high-stakes financial power play? Only time—and perhaps a jury—will decide.Also Read: Erin Andrews breaks silence with three-word Easter message as FOX future remains unclear",Lawyer reveals Shannon Sharpe nearly paid $10 million to resolve rape accusation quietly.
