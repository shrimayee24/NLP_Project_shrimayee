Indian family’s behavior on Finland train sparks clash over cultural norms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/etimes/trending/indian-familys-behavior-on-finland-train-sparks-clash-over-cultural-norms/articleshow/116637434.cms,"Indians' lack of civic sense abroad is a recurring concern, highlighted recently by an Indian tourist in Finland who shared his frustration over a loud family disrupting the peace on a quiet train. His story sparked widespread agreement online, with many recounting similar incidents and emphasising the need for greater awareness.

I'm on a train from Lapland to Helsinki and there's one family in the otherwise ULTRA QUIET carriage that's being very loud, talking to someone over a video call. In Hindi. With their cabin doors open.



We REALLY don't get civic sense, do we? — Gokul ⚡️ (@gokulns) December 23, 2024

Traveling to foreign countries often reveals stark cultural differences; behaviors considered normal in one place can appear unconventional or even inappropriate in another. This was the case on a Finland train when an NRI got annoyed by a ‘loud’ Indian family on an otherwise quiet train.A user, Gokul Sridhar(@gokul), shared a tweet about his experience in a train compartment which he shared with people including an Indian family. Gokul described the carriage as ""extremely quiet"" until the family began speaking loudly in Hindi and leaving their cabin doors open. He expressed his frustration, remarking that Indians often lack "" civic sense .""He posted, “I'm on a train from Lapland to Helsinki and there's one family in the otherwise ULTRA QUIET carriage that's being very loud, talking to someone over a video call. In Hindi. With their cabin doors open. We REALLY don't get civic sense, do we?” He further added that ironically this incident happened right when he was watching a video that explained that talking loudly in trains is frowned upon in Japan as it is considered bad manners.If Sridhar thought that he had to bear the family only for the duration of the train, he was wrong. He updated in the comment section of his post that he somehow ended up in the same restaurant as the family who were again talking to someone loudly and that too without headphones. An X user advised Sridhar, “Easier to stop by and request them to close the door and lower their voice?” To which he retorts, “Yup I'm gonna do that but there shouldn't even be a need for this, is my point.”The post has since received more than 12k views and the comment section has divided reaction to this. A user sharing his own experience said, “Same in Manc. I'm on a train to London on the quiet coach trying to get some sleep. Guess who's talking on their phone loudly in the QUIET COACH”However, some sympathetic users asked Sridhar to tell them instead of complaining about them on social media. One user said, “And you chose to post on X rather than educating them to be quiet. Might be their first time on foreign land and out of excitement.. as a concerned Indian you must have told them the etiquettes politely.. posting on X will not improve the situation.”The incident reignited discussions about public behavior and cultural differences , as it highlighted the challenges of navigating diverse social norms in shared spaces. Some argue that cultural awareness and sensitivity are essential to avoid misunderstandings and conflicts, especially in multicultural environments. The clash on the Finland train serves as a reminder of the importance of respecting local customs and behaviors, while also fostering an atmosphere of mutual respect and tolerance. This incident underscores the need for travelers to be mindful of their actions and consider how they may be perceived by others in different cultural contexts, promoting harmony and understanding.This is not for the firs time, even in past there have been instances, where social media posts have raised eyebrows on such instances, where people forget civic sense. What do you think of such incidents? Share your thoughts with us in the comments section.Culture plays a vital role in shaping individuals, communities, and societies. It reflects the values, beliefs, traditions, and practices that define a group of people, fostering a sense of identity and belonging. Culture preserves history and heritage, passing knowledge, art, and customs from one generation to the next, ensuring continuity and connection to the past. It promotes social harmony by encouraging shared values, mutual respect, and inclusivity, enabling diverse groups to coexist peacefully.","An Indian tourist in Finland shared his frustration over a loud family disrupting the peace on a quiet train.

The NFL was criticized for allowing Beyonce to make finger guns

Beyoncé performed at the Ravens vs Texans game during the NFL's live Christmas Gameday coverage on Netflix, dubbed the Beyoncé Bowl, which ended with a bang. The 43-year-old singer's finger guns during her performance are considered a ""violent gesture"" by the NFL in its pursuit of a more ""family friendly"" look, netting players significant fines and penalties. This has led to speculations of whether the league will fine the singer for her illegal use of a hand signal.Beyonce may be fined by the NFL for using a gun hand gesture during her Christmas Day half-time performance at the Houston Texans game against the Baltimore Ravens. The 43-year-old, clad in a white bodysuit and cowboy hat, performed some of her greatest hits, joined by Post Malone and Shaboozey.Beyoncé, in a white rhinestone bodysuit, chaps, and her cowboy hat, performed songs from her album Cowboy Carter featuring special guests Shaboozey, Post Malone, and her 12-year-old daughter Blue Ivy. She simulated shooting guns with her fingers during some of her songs. As she sang Texas Hold 'Em, she waved her left hand around, and at the right moment, a banner reading BANG! fell from a suspended platform.The NFL was criticized for allowing Beyonce to make finger guns at halftime, while imposing 15 yard penalties and fines on players for similar ""violent gestures."" This year over $150,000 was imposed on players making gun-related gestures on the field. For his firearm-themed celebration in 2023, Deshaun Watson and David Njoku were fined in excess of $13,000. Thirteen Steelers players were penalized for their machine-gun mimic during a 2022 celebration.Fans were really upset as they took to social media to complain. One user wrote via X.com, formerly Twitter, ""Is the @NFL going to fine @Beyonce for finger guns?!"" Whilst a second added, ""I was thinking the same thing!! How many players were fined for that?"" And a third commented, ""Where is the flag on Beyoncé for the finger guns?!?!”“Still not sold on Beyoncé as a country artist. Still seems like a pop star that just threw a cowboy hat on. It’s also hilarious that the league has been fining players left and right for finger guns and she’s throwing them around like it’s her job,” added a fourth.Also Read: Beyoncé Halftime Show: How much was the 32 time Grammys winner paid by Netflix for her performance?

He has not been charged and denies the allegations, referring to them as ""heinous,"" while calling the lawsuit a ""blackmail attempt."" His attorney called such growing inconsistencies since the lawsuit was filed ""inexcusable.""Jay-Z was not in the crowd to experience his wife's nearly 13-minute Christmas Day concert, but their eldest, Blue Ivy, 12, stole the show when she came out and danced alongside her mother.","Beyonce performed at the Ravens vs Texans game during the NFL's live Christmas Gameday coverage on Netflix.

The Heartbreak Kid was known for his degenerate personality, obscene antics and ability to deliver some of the greatest wrestling matches of all time.

This has led to multiple marriages for The Showstopper as well. While only a few of them are documented, Michaels attracted some of the gorgeous women towards him. Tammy Sytch, popularly known as Sunny, was one of the most popular female WWE superstars during the heights of the Attitude Era. The woman, called the ‘First Diva of WWE’, was a gorgeous one who attracted the attention of Shawn Michaels, who was in his prime back then. The duo were romantically linked at the time due to their onscreen chemistry and intimacy. For a long time, there was no confirmation regarding their relationship. However, Sunny finally confirmed in her autobiography that their relationship lasted for around nine months.Shawn Michaels’ first marriage was to a woman named Theresa Wood. While there is not much known about their relationship, Michaels and Theresa went their separate ways after six years of being together. This was made official as both of them filed for divorce after the end of the relationship.After the end of his relationship with Sunny, Shawn Michaels was involved with former WCW Nitro Girl Rebecca Curci. She worked under the ring name Whisper in Michaels's rival company, but that did not stop him from pursuing Rebecca.

The 20,000-acre estate, purchased in 1862, holds significant historical value for the family. George V, former king of the UK, famously cherished Sandringham, saying, ""Dear old Sandringham, the place I love better than anywhere else in the world."" More than 160 years after it was first acquired by the royal family, the estate remains a cherished setting for the royal Christmas celebrations.The preparations for the holiday include selecting a large Christmas tree from the estate grounds, a tradition started by King Charles' great-great-great-grandfather, Prince Albert. King Charles selects a 20-foot Norfolk spruce tree from the grounds each year. The tree is typically decorated with red, gold, and purple ornaments, along with twinkling Christmas lights. The Grand Staircase is often adorned with festive decorations, and the Waterloo Chamber is transformed into a winter wonderland.The King also approves menus for Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and Boxing Day. The chef traditionally carves the turkey in front of the guests. However, one change King Charles may make concerns the temperature in the home. Prince Harry previously described Sandringham’s temperature as “balmy,” saying, “The corgis always betrayed us. The cool air would make them whimper, and Granny would say: 'Is there a draft?' And then a footman would promptly shut the window.”Guests arrive on Christmas eve based on seniority. As Sandringham is the smallest of the royal residences, some guests may have to sleep in rooms typically reserved for staff. One quirky tradition involves guests weighing themselves upon arrival. A tradition from Edward VII involved weighing guests upon arrival and departure to ensure they were well-fed.The family enjoys afternoon tea at 4 pm, with favorites such as square sandwiches, ham and English mustard, Sage Derby cheese, and Coronation Chicken. Desserts include ginger cake, honey and cream sponge, scones, and a pot of Earl Grey tea.At 6 pm, the family exchanges small, humorous gifts, a nod to the German tradition of ""Heiligabend Bescherung,"" introduced by Prince Albert. Princess Diana once gave Sarah Ferguson a leopard print bath mat, while Kate, Princess of Wales, gifted a ""grow your own girlfriend"" kit to a bachelor Prince Harry.Later in the evening, after the children go to bed, a formal dinner is served for the adults, with men in black tie and women in ballgowns and jewels. The meal is followed by martinis and a lavish four-course feast.Christmas day starts with breakfast and an 11 am church service at St Mary Magdalene Church. The royals greet the crowds as they leave the church. The family returns to Sandringham for pre-lunch drinks, including Veuve Clicquot champagne, and a traditional Christmas dinner at 1 pm. The meal includes turkey, potatoes, vegetables, sprouts, carrots, and parsnips, with Christmas pudding served with brandy butter and brandy sauce, followed by a cheese course with port. The table is decorated with white linen, candelabras, and a sprig of the Holy Thorn, a tradition that dates back before the Reformation.The King's speech is watched on television afterward. The family spends the rest of the afternoon at leisure.In the evening, guests enjoy a buffet of traditional English cuisine, including boar's head, ox tongue, and seafood, along with a table of chocolates and mints.Boxing Day features a hunt for the men, followed by lunch and dinner with traditional dishes. The meal typically consists of hearty fare, such as beef bourguignon with mashed potatoes and red cabbage. For dessert, there is apple pie and Christmas pudding slices fried in unsalted butter. Dinner that evening might feature venison with dauphinoise potatoes and carrots, followed by a chocolate pie made of cream, meringue, and cinnamon.Sandringham has witnessed its share of controversy over the years. Princess Diana, who was often unhappy spending Christmas at the estate, would frequently chat with the staff to avoid family members. Royal chef Darren McGrady recalled how Diana would walk around the kitchen after dinner, seeking refuge from the tight quarters of the estate, which he described as “so compact.”In Andrew Morton's biography, Diana was quoted describing a dramatic row with Prince Charles in 1982 when she was pregnant with Prince William. ""I threw myself down the stairs,"" she reportedly said. ""Charles said I was crying wolf, and I said I felt so desperate, and I was crying my eyes out, and he said: 'I'm not going to listen. You're always doing this to me. I'm going riding now.'""Sandringham also hosted a tense summit in January 2020 between King Charles and his sons, Prince William and Prince Harry, after Harry announced he would step back from royal duties. The meeting led to a public statement from the Queen, wishing Harry and Meghan a “peaceful and happy new life.” Meghan Markle , who enjoyed her first Christmas at Sandringham in 2017, shared a fond memory with her mother. “It’s just like a big family like I always wanted,” she said during a phone call. ""There was just this constant movement and energy and fun."" Prince Harry also spoke of happier times, saying, ""Christmas was fantastic.""","The Royal Family gathers at King Charles' Sandringham estate in Norfolk each Christmas.

'Diana hated Sandringham'

‘No boisterous behavior’

Disappointment over gag gifts

Familiar yet unwelcome traditions

Royal experts weigh in

Princess Diana reportedly 'hated' spending Christmas with the royal family at Sandringham Estate in UK. Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine, revealed that Diana found the royal holiday traditions “claustrophobic.”Speaking to Fox News Digital, Seward explained that Diana felt constrained by the royal customs, saying she did not want to follow so many rules to enjoy herself. “Diana hated Sandringham,” Seward said. “Even when her romance with Charles was going well, she still didn’t like it… I think she found it claustrophobic because Diana was such a free spirit. She didn’t want to have to enjoy herself with so many rules. [But] they’re not rules. They’re just traditions of royalty.” Seward noted that the order of precedence and other royal traditions made Diana uncomfortable.In his 1992 book Diana: Her True Story, author Andrew Morton recounted Diana’s experience during her first Christmas at Sandringham in 1981. She had given expensive gifts, while the royal family exchanged gag gifts.“It was highly fraught,” Diana told Morton. “I know I gave, but I can’t remember being a receiver. Isn’t that awful? I do all the presents, and Charles signs the cards. [It was] terrifying and so disappointing. No boisterous behavior, lots of tension, silly behavior, silly jokes that outsiders would find odd, but insiders understood.” Diana added, “I sure was [an outsider].”Seward corroborated this story, sharing that a friend who worked at Sandringham witnessed Diana’s disappointment. Diana reportedly gave cashmere sweaters and other expensive items but received a simple, less thoughtful gift in return. “She just couldn’t understand [it],” Seward said. “To her, Christmas was all about spending a bit more than you could probably afford and getting really nice presents.”Despite her dislike for the traditions, Diana was familiar with Sandringham as her father had a house on the estate. However, her hairdresser, Richard Dalton, told author Kitty Kelley that Diana “hated going to Sandringham for Christmas,” mentioning the cold and the requirement to watch the Queen’s Christmas message on television. Dalton referred to it as a “command performance.” An unnamed friend also told author Tina Brown that Diana dreaded going to Sandringham.Royal experts shared their views on Diana’s experience at Sandringham. Hilary Fordwich explained that Diana’s gift-giving experience was “embarrassing and painful,” as she wasn’t aware of the family’s gag gift tradition. Nick Bullen, co-founder of True Royalty TV, commented that the royals exchange “silly joke presents,” with author Christopher Andersen noting that Queen Elizabeth II preferred gag gifts. Andersen also claimed that Prince Charles’ favorite gift was a toilet seat from Princess Anne.King Charles and Diana had separated in 1992 and divorced in 1996.","Princess Diana reportedly 'hated' spending Christmas with the royal family at Sandringham Estate in UK.

What is the THAAD System?

Key features of THAAD include:

Range and coverage: Capable of engaging targets up to 200 kilometres away, THAAD covers a larger area than the Patriot missile system and complements other defence platforms like the Aegis and Ground-based Midcourse systems.

Capable of engaging targets up to 200 kilometres away, THAAD covers a larger area than the Patriot missile system and complements other defence platforms like the Aegis and Ground-based Midcourse systems.

A THAAD battery includes six truck-mounted launchers, 48 interceptors, an advanced AN/TPY-2 radar system, and a fire control unit. Deployment: Operated by a crew of 95 soldiers, the system is rapidly deployable and designed to protect against evolving missile threats both within and outside the atmosphere.

The United States' Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system was deployed in Israel to intercept a Houthi ballistic missile launched from Yemen, Times of Israel reported. This marks the first operational use of the advanced missile defence system since its deployment to Israel in October. Footage shared on social media captured the dramatic launch of a THAAD interceptor, with an American soldier exclaiming, ""Eighteen years I’ve been waiting for this.""The missile, reportedly targeting Israel, was neutralised by air defence systems. However, the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) have not specified whether the interception was achieved by the American THAAD or an Israeli system. According to sources cited by Reuters, an analysis is underway to determine the success of the THAAD system.The Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system is a cornerstone of the US ballistic missile defence network. Designed to intercept short- to intermediate-range ballistic missiles during their terminal phase, THAAD employs “hit-to-kill” technology, where interceptors physically collide with incoming missiles to destroy them. This approach minimises collateral damage and maximises precision.Originally developed by Lockheed Martin in the 1990s, THAAD has undergone significant testing and enhancements. The US Army currently operates seven THAAD batteries, with deployments in strategic locations such as Guam and South Korea, and most recently, Israel.","The Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system is a cornerstone of the US ballistic missile defence network.

Polo flops and “box office poison” drama

Cookery show under pressure

The Sussex struggle: From Hollywood darlings to “colossal bombs”

Crisis control or end of the road?

It seems like the honeymoon phase between Prince Harry, Meghan Markle, and Netflix is officially over. Once hailed as the streaming platform’s dream duo, the Sussexes’ partnership with Netflix has hit a rough patch, with insiders whispering about mounting frustration and dwindling faith in their ability to deliver hits.The latest debacle? Their five-part documentary about polo, which critics have torched as a “tedious inside look” and a “dull indulgence.” One reviewer even joked it felt like a spoof designed to play in the background of Succession.As per the sources quoted by the Daily Mail, Netflix executives are “exhausted” from working with Markle. The fallout is apparently so bad that her upcoming cookery show—still without a premiere date—is being labeled as her “make or break” moment. “It’s so much work with her, and, bluntly, the ‘deliverable’ does not seem to be worth it,” one insider said.Adding fuel to the fire, there’s been zero buzz around the polo series. No press tours, no promotional events, no hype. Even Nacho Figueras, Harry’s polo pal and a star of the series, has barely mentioned it on social media. Hollywood veteran Sean McNulty told The Daily Beast: “The lack of a proper press campaign for a Harry and Meghan project is eyebrow-raising, to say the least.”According to reports, Meghan’s cookery show is now the Sussexes’ last hope at staying in Netflix’s good graces. One entertainment exec was quotes by the Daily Mail as saying, “Her show will have to be an enormous hit to turn around their deal and their reputations in this town.”The show is expected to drop in early 2024, coinciding with Harry’s appearance at the Winter Invictus Games in Canada and the launch of Meghan’s homeware brand, American Riviera Orchard . Talk about multitasking under pressure.Critics are having a field day with Harry and Meghan’s current reputation—or lack thereof. Marketing expert Tony Case didn’t mince words, was quoted by the Daily Beast as saying, “Harry and Meghan are box office poison. Everyone is running away from this colossal bomb.”He added, “They set out to conquer America, but no one here found them—or what they’re selling—to be particularly compelling.”Even their highly-publicized project Meet Me at the Lake, based on a best-selling novel, remains in limbo. With no production in sight, it’s unlikely to materialize before their Netflix deal is up for renewal next year.Friends who once hyped their projects are unusually quiet, fueling speculation that Hollywood may be losing patience with the couple. A source quoted in Closer Magazine tried to defend the Sussexes, blaming Netflix for pushing a “reality TV angle” that was out of their control.","The Sussexes’ partnership with Netflix has hit a rough patch, with insiders whispering about mounting frustration and dwindling faith in their ability to deliver hits. “It’s so much work with her, and, bluntly, the ‘deliverable’ does not seem to be worth it,” one insider said.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Change in UPI Rule: RBI allows UPI access for prepaid payment instruments via third-party apps,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/change-in-upi-rule-rbi-allows-upi-access-for-prepaid-payment-instruments-via-third-party-apps/articleshow/116750577.cms,"What is the UPI rule change

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has significantly expanded the functionality of Prepaid Payment Instruments (PPIs) by allowing users to make and receive UPI payments through any third-party UPI-enabled app. This change, announced by RBI, marks a major step towards interoperability in the digital payments ecosystem.Prepaid Payment Instrument or PPIs is a financial tool that allows users to store funds on a card or digital wallet for future transactions. PPIs store monetary value and can be used for purchasing goods and services, conducting financial services, and facilitating remittances. This new regulation effectively integrates PPIs more deeply into the UPI ecosystem, further solidifying UPI's position as the dominant digital payment platform in India.Previously, UPI transactions involving PPIs, such as digital wallets, gift cards, and metro cards, were confined to the mobile app provided by the specific PPI issuer. This restriction limited user convenience and the broader adoption of PPIs for UPI transactions. Now, holders of full-KYC (Know Your Customer) compliant PPIs can link their instruments to popular UPI apps like Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm, and BHIM, similar to how they link bank accounts.According to the RBI's circular, ""A PPI issuer shall enable holders of only its full-KYC PPIs to make UPI payments by linking its customer PPIs to its UPI handle. UPI transactions from PPI on the issuer’s application shall be authenticated using the customer’s existing PPI credentials. Such a transaction will, thus, be pre-approved before it reaches the UPI system. A PPI issuer, in its capacity as a PSP, shall not on-board customers of any bank or any other PPI issuer."" This means that only PPIs with complete customer verification (KYC) will be eligible for this feature. The authentication of these UPI transactions originating from PPIs will occur using the user's existing PPI credentials before the transaction reaches the UPI network, adding an extra layer of security. This pre-authorization process ensures that the PPI issuer validates the transaction before it is processed by the UPI system.The RBI also emphasized that PPI issuers, in their role as payment system providers, are prohibited from onboarding customers of other banks or PPI issuers. This stipulation aims to maintain a clear separation and prevent potential conflicts of interest.This move aligns with the RBI's broader objective of promoting digital payments and enhancing financial inclusion. By enabling greater interoperability between PPIs and the UPI network, the RBI aims to make digital transactions more seamless and accessible for a wider range of users. This decision also brings PPIs on par with bank accounts in terms of UPI accessibility, as bank account holders can already use any UPI app for transactions.UPI, developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), has revolutionized digital payments in India , facilitating instant real-time inter-bank transactions through mobile phones.","The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has significantly expanded the functionality of Prepaid Payment Instruments (PPIs) by allowing users to make and receive UPI payments through any third-party UPI-enabled app. This change, announced by RBI, marks a major step towards interoperability in the digital payments ecosystem.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116750575,imgsize-25458,width-400,resizemode-4/116750575.jpg"

NYT Strands December 29, 2024 – Hints, answers, Spangram

Spangram for today



Today's Strands’ answers:

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

Here’s what the union minister wrote on X

Zero tolerance for consumer exploitation!!

This Prima Facie looks like Unfair Trade Practice where the cab-aggregators are alleged to be using Differential Pricing based on the factors mentioned in the article below. If so, this is blatant dis-regard to Consumer’s right to know. I have directed @jagograhakjago through CCPA to conduct a detailed inquiry into this and submit a report at the earliest. Have asked the department to look into other sectors as well like, food delivery apps, online ticket booking apps etc.

Union Minister of Consumer Affairs, Pralhad Joshi said that the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) will investigate ride-hailing apps like Ola Uber and Rapido for allegedly charging different fares for identical rides on Android and Apple devices. Joshi expressed concern over what he described as a ""prima facie unfair trade practice"" and a ""blatant disregard"" for consumers' right to transparency. In a post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Joshi said that he has directed the consumer protection watchdog to carry out a thorough inquiry and submit a report as soon as possible.“Zero tolerance for consumer exploitation !” Joshi emphasized, responding to media reports that revealed price discrepancies between mobile platforms – Android and iOS mainly, for the same journey. The investigation will also expand to other sectors, including food delivery and ticket booking apps, he said.",The Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) will investigate ride-hailing apps like Ola Uber and Rapido for allegedly charging different fares for identical rides on Android and Apple devices.

Google Drive now allows users to stream videos immediately after they are uploaded. This update marks the latest in a series of enhancements to the platform's video playback capabilities. This new feature eliminates the wait time previously required for processing before viewing. This improvement follows a major overhaul of Drive's video player in October, which introduced a refreshed user interface and new playback controls.These video-focused upgrades are part of a broader effort by Google to enhance Drive's functionality. Last week, the company introduced an improved document scanner to the cloud storage platform. In 2024, Google added multiple new features to its cloud storage service, making it more than just a basic storage solution. Google Drive now boasts a range of functionalities, including automated backup tools and advanced sharing options.The importance of Google Drive's new instant video playback feature lies in how it addresses the platform's video processing. While Drive preserves the original uploaded video file for download, it also creates a stream-optimised version for its built-in player, similar to YouTube's transcoding process.However, this transcoding can take considerable time. Now, users can start watching their videos immediately after uploading, even though sharing through the Drive player still requires processing to complete. This is a notable improvement for users who frequently work with video files, as it allows for quicker identification and access to content within uploaded clips.","Google Drive now allows users to stream videos immediately after they are uploaded.
