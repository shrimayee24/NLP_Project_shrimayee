"Billionaire Mark Cuban has a ‘success tip’ for students: AI will help students think bigger, but it doesn't …",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/billionaire-mark-cuban-has-a-success-tip-for-students-ai-will-help-students-think-bigger-but-it-doesnt-/articleshow/126352714.cms,"AI-Powered Future: Next Gen Careers You Should Watch

Mark Cuban on biggest barrier for students





American billionaire and Shark Tank investor Mark Cuban said that students these days use artificial intelligence (AI) excessively to ask the “right questions”. However, he said that students should not rely much on AI. Instead, they must use AI to enhance their own critical-thinking skills, rather than replace them. “They use strong inputs and apply critical thinking to evaluate results,” he said adding “AI helps students think bigger, but it doesn’t make decisions”.In an interview with CNBC’s Make It last year, Cuban said that tomorrow’s leaders might be today’s AI-obsessed kids. “Students who use AI will produce better, more creative work and gain a collaborative relationship with technology that’s needed in the future workplace,” he said adding: “Students who use AI will be best equipped to lead.”During the interview, Mark Cuban said that “Access is the biggest barrier” to students being taught how to best use AI tools effectively and ethically at school. According to Samsung’s new Solve for Tomorrow 2025 AI Readiness Study, 80% of US teachers believe that learning AI skills is important for students’ success in the future. However, research shows that educators have expressed concern over misuse of AI tools to cheat, or that the information obtained from AI models will include errors that spread misinformation.But Cuban has asserted that students need to learn to use AI tools properly and productively. He has previously likened the current AI boom to past technological revolutions, particularly the rise of computers and the internet. “Spend as much time as possible familiarizing yourself with the latest AI tools and models, so you can impress future employers with your up-to-date prompt engineering and model customization skills,” an advice that he often gives to students, per a CNBC report.Speaking on an episode of the “TBPN” podcast in 2025, Mark Cuban said”“Every single company needs that. There is nothing intuitive for a company to integrate AI, and that’s what people don’t understand. That is going to be jobs left and right.”","Mark Cuban said that students these days use artificial intelligence (AI) excessively to ask the “right questions” He said that they must use AI to enhance their own critical-thinking skills, rather than replace them. “AI helps students think bigger, but it doesn’t make decisions”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126352688,imgsize-29300,width-400,resizemode-4/billionaire-mark-cuban-has-a-success-tip-for-students-ai-will-help-students-think-bigger-but-it-doesn39t-.jpg"

EXPOSED: Mark Zuckerberg Embarrassed on Hot Mic Admitting Total Confusion During Trump Dinner





Ever since Mark Zuckerberg announced the creation of Meta Superintelligence Labs in first half of 2025, Meta CEO has been on an AI hiring blitz. A Twitter user who goes by the moniker @HinataMotivates, said to be a tech-motivation account, shared a podcast clip (going back to 2022) where Zuckerberg talks about Meta hiring rule and his advice for college students. Mark Zuckerberg has a hiring rule that he says is cardinal for him while hiring anyone and the one that he says is also an important tip for any college student. In an episode of the “Lex Fridman Podcast,” hosted by MIT computer scientist Lex Fridman, Zuckerberg said that most people know Facebook ’s dorm-room origin story and that many have learned the wrong lesson from it. He said that his initial ability to launch Facebook wasn’t because he dropped out of college. According to Zuckerberg, it was due to the personal connections he made while he was still in school.Who you spend time with in college, Zuckerberg said, is “the most important decision” any student can make in college. He advised college students that choosing their social circle is the most pivotal decision, as people tend to emulate those around them. “You become the people you surround yourself with,” he said in the podcast.“I think probably people are too, in general, objective focused, and maybe not focused enough on the connections and the people who they’re basically building relationships [with]. ” Meta CEO Zuckerberg is said to have met his Facebook co-founders ⁠— Eduardo Saverin, Dustin Moskovitz, Chris Hughes and Andrew McCollum ⁠— while the five were students at Harvard University.While the group split up in a not-so-happy manner, Zuckerberg said on the podcast that he tries to prioritize relationships over objectives. This applies especially to hiring. Zuckerberg said that he extends the idea to his Meta hiring philosophy: He only employs candidates he did hypothetically work for, underscoring reciprocity and alignment in professional networks. When evaluating a job candidate, he imagines what it would be like to work for that person. “I will only hire someone to work for me if I can see myself working for them,” he said.Mark Zuckerberg said that the strategy creates a work environment that’s both more cohesive and more productive: If you work with people who share your values on a human level, you’ll be more likely to smoothly achieve your work goals together. It’s all about finding personal compatibility, he said, not unlike “choosing friends or a partner.”","Mark Zuckerberg has a hiring rule that he says is cardinal for him while hiring anyone.

Nvidia’s Alpamayo to debut with Mercedes CLA





At the ongoing Consumer Electronics Show (CES), Nvidia launched Alpamayo – an open source AI model for autonomous vehicles. Announcing the new AI model, CEO Jensen Huang said that it is the world’s first thinking, reasoning autonomous vehicle AI. He further revealed that the Alpamayo is launching on US roads later this year, starting with the Mercedes CLA. “Alpamayo brings reasoning to autonomous vehicles, allowing them to think through rare scenarios, drive safely in complex environments, and explain their driving decisions,” he further added. Responding to one such posts about the autonomous vehicle AI, Tesla CEO Elon Musk wrote:“Well that’s just exactly what Tesla is doing 😂 What they will find is that it’s easy to get to 99% and then super hard to solve the long tail of the distribution.”Alpamayo introduces Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models designed for self-driving systems. The models will allow autonomous vehicles to understand visual inputs, assess driving situations and decide on driving actions. The platform also includes large reasoning models, simulation tools to test rare or unusual driving situations, and open datasets that can be used for training and validation.Talking about Alpamayo, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement that “The ChatGPT moment for physical AI is here – when machines begin to understand, reason, and act in the real world”.“It's trained end-to-end. Literally from camera in to actuation out; It reasons what action it is about to take, the reason by which it came about that action, and the trajectory”, he added.""With a 10-billion-parameter architecture, Alpamayo 1 uses video input to generate trajectories alongside reasoning traces, showing the logic behind each decision. Developers can adapt Alpamayo 1 into smaller runtime models for vehicle development, or use it as a foundation for AV development tools such as reasoning-based evaluators and auto-labeling systems. Alpamayo 1 provides open model weights and open-source inferencing scripts. Future models in the family will feature larger parameter counts, more detailed reasoning capabilities, more input and output flexibility, and options for commercial usage,"" he continued.As mentioned above, Nvidia has partnered with Mercedes to bring its autonomous vehicle AI. Announcing the partnership, the chip maker said “NVIDIA is enabling a new era of AI-defined driving, bringing its NVIDIA DRIVE AV software with enhanced level 2 point-to-point driver assistance capabilities to U.S. roads, expected by end of this year — starting with Mercedes-Benz, a long-standing partner in advancing safe, intelligent mobility. ”“The all-new Mercedes-Benz CLA — the brand’s first vehicle featuring the MB.OS platform — introduces advanced driver-assistance features powered by NVIDIA’s full-stack DRIVE AV software, AI infrastructure and accelerated compute.This design may enable over-the-air updates of future upgrades and new features, including planned enhancements to MB.DRIVE ASSIST PRO, which may be available ex-factory and through the Mercedes-Benz store.”","Nvidia’s Alpamayo to debut with Mercedes CLA later this year.

Microsoft CEO 'Thrilled' About India's Growing Data Centre Capacity, Details Meet With PM Modi





OpenAI cofounder disagrees with CEO Sam Altman on AGI timeline





Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently shared what he sees as a key test for the next stage of artificial intelligence (AI). As companies race to build AI agents that can act independently, Suleyman said he is watching for a milestone he calls Artificial Capable Intelligence (ACI) on the path toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). He said that the test is simple in context but difficult in execution – whether an AI agent can legally take $1,00,000 and turn it into $1 million. He described the test as “modern turing test”, suggesting it will show how AI systems can plan, reason, make decisions and operate within real-word rules.“The next big milestone I'm watching for on our way to AGI: Artificial Capable Intelligence (ACI). Can an agent take $100k and legally turn it into $1M? To me that's the modern Turing Test,” Mustafa Suleyman wrote in a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter).Suleyman’s comments come as several technology leaders including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff bet heavily on AI agents as the next major shift in enterprise software. Companies such as OpenAI, Salesforce, Microsoft and others are promoting agents that can carry out tasks with limited human input, from writing code to managing business workflows.Last year, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff called the rise of AI in the workforce a “digital labor revolution,” estimating that the software company has reached about 93% accuracy with the technology.In an interview with Bloomberg then, he revealed that AI is doing up to 50% of the work at Salesforce.In 2025, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman predicted that AI could soon automate up to 40% of the tasks humans currently perform. He also claimed that AGI could arrive before 2030.Recently, OpenAI cofounder and AI researcher Andrej Karpathy pushed back against the “agentic AI” hype, characterizing the current generation of autonomous AI systems as “slop.” Karpathy has directly challenged the notion that autonomous AI agents are on the cusp of delivering as promised, positioning himself in contrast to the optimistic timelines often suggested by figures like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.“I feel like the industry is making too big of a jump and is trying to pretend like this is amazing, and it’s not. It’s slop,"" Karpathy said on The Dwarkesh Podcast.“They’re not coming to terms with it, and maybe they’re trying to fundraise or something like that. We’re at this intermediate stage,” he added.","Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman proposes a new test for advanced AI: can an agent legally grow $100,000 into $1 million?

Backlash grows after Daily Wire quietly relaunches Candace Owens’ former podcast





The fallout between Candace Owens and The Daily Wire has taken a sharp new turn, and this time the backlash is not coming from Owens alone. A decision tied to her former podcast has ignited criticism across the media space, raising uncomfortable questions about ownership, control, and motive in digital broadcasting.The controversy gained traction after claims surfaced that the network plans to revive Owens’ former show using archived material. While the brand still owns the rights, the move struck many as aggressive rather than strategic. Among the loudest voices pushing back is podcaster Melissa Witte, who did not hold back in her reaction.In a January 6 post on X, Witte accused the Daily Wire of clinging to Owens’ influence instead of building something new. She wrote, ""So the Daily Wire is going to relaunch Candace’s podcast- the one they still own the rights to- but in place of Candace they’re going to have a pickme intern who will simply recap Candace’s latest show and make fun of it.""Her criticism escalated from there. ""Do you understand how sad and pathetic you have to be as a media company to lose your most popular host and instead of simply reflecting on that and working to produce better content, you take the sad, psycho, ex-boyfriend route and just draft off her wake instead? Like… what’s next? You losers gonna key her DW anniversary into the driver’s side door of her car? WTAF? Who does crazy sh*t like this???""Owens echoed that sentiment on her current podcast, describing the experience as unsettling rather than professional.She explained, ""About an hour before we went live, a bunch of people were messaging me saying that the daily wire had brought back my old YouTube channel they had seemingly deleted.""She later compared the situation to a breakup that never truly ended. ""I genuinely feel like when you break up with someone and you have a crazy ex, that was how it felt like being fired from Daily Wire.""Owens also alleged ongoing pressure behind the scenes. ""In a normal world, your employer, if they fire you, that should be the last you hear of them.""The Daily Wire has not publicly responded to the criticism. What remains clear is that the relaunch has reopened old wounds and shifted the narrative away from content and toward intent.Also Read: “Crazy ex-stalker”: Candace Owens accuses The Daily Wire of “toxic” behavior nearly two years after her dismissal",Daily Wire quietly relaunches Candace Owens' former podcast using archived material.

The 61-second video of UK PM Keir Starmer would be shocking, if it were true.

""Under the new rule, no one will be permitted to leave their home after 11pm without official authorisation.""Starmer never made any such policy or announcement. But thanks to AI, the PM in the short video sounded eerily like the real one. The fake video attracted over 430,000 views and inspired similar posts on X and Facebook. That video, and other similar ones, appears to have been taken down by the Chinese-owned social media company, which officially prohibits ""fake authoritative sources or crisis events, or falsely shows public figures in certain contexts. ""But the clip was just one of 6,042 such videos, most featuring Starmer, identified by NewsGuard, a company that tracks online misinformation, between May and Dec.

Together, the accounts had more than 1 million followers when the report was issued.

Rather, she said, they are likely being created by content producers whose primary goal is to make money by making videos that go viral.The widespread adoption of easy-to-use AI video generation tools, like OpenAI's Sora, has dramatically increased the number of fake videos on TikTok and other social media platforms. The fake videos come at a particularly difficult time for the PM, who is already suffering from very low polling numbers. In one video, Starmer seems to announce new drivers licence laws that could strip many British people of their ability to drive legally in the country. Another video has Starmer's faked voice declaring that new rules will allow the authorities to access any British person's phone, along with its private data.In the immediate days after NewsGuard published its report on Dec 9, many of the videos were available on TikTok.

UAE's new exit permit rule 2026

‘Friday trap’ warnings

The 1-Day Warning: A written notice is issued after just one unexcused absence.

The 6-Day Referral: By the sixth day of absence, the case is escalated to the Child Protection Unit.

The 15-Day Limit: If a student accumulates 15 unexcused days in a single academic year, the consequences are severe. The file is referred to external child protection agencies, and the student may even be required to repeat the entire academic year.

What parents must know?

Certified medical illness or travel for treatment.

Bereavement (death of a close relative).

Participation in official national or international events.

Emergency situations like natural disasters or ""force majeure.""





The UAE has rolled out a new rule that no student will be allowed to leave school grounds without an official exit permit from the school. This change comes as part of broader efforts by education authorities to strengthen student safety, discipline and supervision during school dismissal times.Officials emphasise that this is not just a bureaucratic step, it’s aimed at preventing unauthorised departures and ensuring schools can reliably account for every child at the end of the school day.The most significant change for families this year is the introduction of the mandatory ""Exit Permit."" Gone are the days of informal pick-ups; now, every student requires an official document to pass through the school gates at the end of the day.To secure this permit, parents are required to play an active role in the paperwork.You will need to provide a recent passport-sized photograph of your child and a copy of your Emirates ID. However, it isn't just a digital transaction. School administrations now require parents to attend in person to sign a written undertaking.This document clearly defines how the student will travel home, whether by bus, private car, or walking, and officially assigns responsibility to the person collecting themWhile there is a nominal fee for issuing these permits, school officials stress that this system is a non-negotiable prerequisite for student safety.It isn’t just the exit gates that are getting stricter; the Ministry of Education has also overhauled attendance tracking with a rigorous escalation system.If a student misses school without a valid excuse, the ""warning clock"" starts immediately.Parents should also be aware of what many are calling the ""Friday Trap."" Under the new rules, an unexcused absence on a Friday, or on days immediately before or after a public holiday, counts as two days against the student’s limit.This measure is specifically designed to discourage families from extending weekends or holidays without prior approval.To help families stay on top of these rules, the Ministry is rolling out an instant messaging system. Parents will now receive real-time notifications the moment their child is marked absent or late. However, the government recognizes that life happens. According to the latest guidelines, there are eight officially recognized excuses that will not result in penalties.These include:Documentation for these absences must be submitted within five working days. Schools are also required to create ""Individual Support Plans"" for students who struggle with attendance, offering counseling and motivational programs rather than just discipline.These new rules are part of a broader ""Student Protection Policy"" championed by authorities like ADEK (Abu Dhabi Department of Education and Knowledge) and the Ministry of Education. The goal is to create a ""locked-down"" environment where student safety is guaranteed from the moment they step onto the bus until they are safely back in their parents' care.By requiring ""mandated reporting"" from all school staff and using smart gate technology, the UAE is aligning its education system with global safety standards.

Farmers: Take immediate precautions to protect frost-sensitive crops in northern and western desert regions.

Emergency Contact: For any weather-related emergencies, residents are urged to contact the hotline at 112.





Meteorology departments across the Gulf have issued a weather alert for strong winds and significantly reduced visibility, particularly in Kuwait , with impacts likely felt in coastal and inland areas today. Officials warn that northwesterly winds exceeding 60 km/h will sweep through parts of the region, bringing dust, blowing sand, and horizontal visibility dropping below 1,000 meters in exposed spots.Kuwait is bracing for a day of turbulent weather as the Meteorological Department issues a stern warning for Monday, January 5, 2026. A powerful northwesterly wind system is set to dominate the skyline, with speeds expected to roar past 60 km/h. This isn’t just a breeze; the sheer force of the wind is predicted to kick up significant dust and sand across the country, turning the blue skies into a hazy brown.For those heading out, the impact will be immediate. Horizontal visibility is expected to plummet to less than 1,000 meters in several regions. In open desert areas and along highways, experts warn that visibility could occasionally hit zero due to sand drifting.If you are commuting between cities, expect a ""whiteout"" effect, only this time, it’s made of desert sand.Alongside strong winds, Kuwait’s Meteorological Department has also issued a cold weather warning, cautioning that minimum temperatures are expected to drop below 3°C, raising the risk of frost formation in agricultural and desert areas. The frost alert is in effect from 1:30am to 8:30am on Monday, January 5, with authorities urging farmers and residents in open areas to take precautionary measures to protect crops, livestock and outdoor equipment. The warning was issued shortly after 1:00am, highlighting a sharp overnight temperature drop.The chaos isn't limited to the land. Mariners and beachgoers are being told to stay clear of the water as the ""freshening"" northwesterly winds wreak havoc on sea conditions. The Meteorological Department has confirmed that waves in the Arabian Gulf could surge to heights of 6 to 7 feet.This ""rough to very rough"" sea state poses a significant risk to small boats and fishing vessels. Authorities have officially advised against all marine activities until the wind activity subsides. The warning is currently slated to remain in peak effect from 10:00 AM until 4:00 PM, though choppy conditions may persist well into the evening.As the dust begins to settle, a different kind of weather threat is creeping in: a biting cold snap. Following the wind shift, temperatures are expected to take a dramatic dive. Forecasters have issued a rare frost warning for agricultural and desert areas, with minimum temperatures potentially dipping below 3°C.This sudden drop in mercury follows a period of relatively mild weather, making the change feel even more severe. The Ministry of Health has urged residents, especially those with respiratory conditions like asthma or allergies, to stay indoors to avoid the dual threat of fine dust particles and the freezing air. For those who must go out, wearing N95 masks is highly recommended to filter out the PM2.5 pollutants carried by the wind.The Ministry of Interior (MoI) and the Meteorological Department have activated emergency protocols to manage the fallout from the shifting pressure systems. Acting Director of the Meteorology Department, Dhirar Al-Ali, stated that the country is currently under the influence of a ""deep surface low-pressure system,"" which is driving the atmospheric instability.To stay safe, authorities recommend the following:Similar conditions have appeared in recent months across the Gulf. Strong winds and blowing dust have prompted earlier warnings of reduced visibility and hazardous seas in Kuwait and neighbouring Gulf states, as noted by meteorology departments in routine forecasts.This kind of northwesterly wind pattern is common during transitional weather periods and can stir up dust storms, further robbing the air of clarity and increasing the risk of travel delays.","Strong winds, dust storms, and a sharp temperature drop are sweeping across Kuwait.

Burj Khalifa as a vision of height and how it grew taller



Burj Khalifa’s breakthrough: Buttressed core system



Burj Khalifa’s engineering against the elements: Wind, heat, sand



Burj Khalifa’s safety, sustainability and built in innovation



Burj Khalifa: A legacy that is larger than its height







When the Burj Khalifa opened on January 4, 2010, it did not just take the title of the world’s tallest building, it announced Dubai to the world as a hub of ambition, innovation and architectural daring. More than a decade later, architects and engineers still marvel at how it was done and how the structure continues to stand as a benchmark of engineering excellence. At the centre of that success is Bill Baker, the structural engineer whose pioneering designs made the 828-metre landmark possible.Read on as we explore the groundbreaking systems and safety features that not only helped build Burj Khalifa but keep it safe, stable and relevant in 2026, by design as much as by physics.Did you know that the original concept for the Burj Khalifa was not always as tall as it is today? The building began life planned for about 518 metres but as engineers tested and refined the design, they realised it was possible to go much higher while keeping stability and cost efficiency in check. Through iterative wind-tunnel experiments and modelling, the team increased the design by another 310 metres, roughly the height of the Eiffel Tower, without compromising safety or performance.This refinement was not just ambition, it was engineering evolution. From the outset, the project’s core team, led by Emaar Properties and coordinated with global experts, approached the build with flexibility and scientific rigour. The result is not just a taller building but a smarter one.At the heart of Burj Khalifa’s structural resilience is an innovative design known as the “buttressed core”, a concept developed by Baker and his colleagues at Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM). This system uses a central reinforced core shaped like an irregular hexagon, with three wings extending outward in a Y-shaped plan.For its torsional stability, the hexagonal core acts much like an axle, resisting twists and turns that wind forces cause at great heights. For wind resistance, each wing buttresses the others, distributing load evenly and making the structure incredibly stable even in strong gusts. Burj Khalifa's aerodynamic efficiency is credited to the unusual shape that helps “confuse the wind”, so vortices don’t form consistently around the surface, dramatically reducing oscillation forces.This structural system made it possible for Burj Khalifa to break previous height records by a huge margin, not incrementally but dramatically. It is a standard-setter that has since influenced other super-tall buildings around the world.Dubai’s environmental conditions presented unique challenges. With summer temperatures often exceeding 50 °C and desert winds exerting unpredictable force, the design team needed solutions on multiple fronts. For the wind tunnel testing, the team conducted over 40 wind tunnel analyses to model how the building would respond to every possible force, adjusting setbacks and facade angles accordingly.For concrete and cladding, special cladding panels (about 26,000 of them) were hand-cut to fit perfectly and minimise thermal and light stress. Ultra-reflective materials protect the structure from heat gain. For its foundations, instead of sitting directly on loose sand, Burj Khalifa rises from a reinforced concrete mat supported by deep bored piles, anchoring the entire 828-metre tower on solid ground.Beyond these classical engineering feats, modern protective technologies like cathodic corrosion protection help guard steel reinforcement in the foundation from salt-rich groundwater, ensuring a long lifespan for the structure at its base.The Burj Khalifa was designed long before “sustainability” became a global buzzword, yet some of its features anticipated today’s priorities. Its efficient skin design is such that because of its Y-plan, only one-sixth of the building’s surface is exposed to direct sunlight at any time, which reduces solar heat gain and improves cooling efficiency.For fresh water harvesting, instead of letting condensate from air-conditioning systems drain away, the building’s design captures the equivalent of 20 Olympic-size pools of water each year, which is a hidden but smart reuse strategy. For climate-responsive comforts, higher floors benefit from cooler temperatures and clearer air, making upper-level conditions surprisingly pleasant despite the desert environment.From energy efficiency to water management, Burj Khalifa’s design anticipated elements of today’s sustainability standards long before they were industry norms.Fifteen years after opening, the Burj Khalifa stands not just as an architectural icon but as a symbol of what coordinated vision and structural innovation can achieve. Bill Baker himself described the tower as a statement of optimism and ambition, which was part engineering marvel and part cultural milestone that inspires millions of visitors every year.The “Burj Effect” goes beyond tourism as properties with views of the skyscraper command premium prices and the building’s presence reshaped Dubai’s skyline and global image. For Baker and the original design team, the real reward is not just in the height record or technical achievements, it is in seeing how the building continues to stand tall, safe and relevant more than a decade after its completion.Looking ahead, experts say that Burj Khalifa’s core concepts will continue to influence future tall-building design, even as materials and technologies evolve. Baker has hinted that even taller structures, potentially breaching the kilometre mark, are possible, though they would likely require new structural systems and solutions for challenges like vertical transportation and pressure changes at extreme heights.In the meantime, Burj Khalifa remains a testament to the blend of human ambition, scientific rigour and architectural artistry. It is a building that did not just redefine Dubai but reshaped what the world believes is possible in vertical architecture.","The Burj Khalifa opened on January 4, 2010.

How to avoid penalties and stay compliant



Avoid excessive revving or loud acceleration in residential areas. Police specifically target such behaviour as disruptive.

Do not fit unauthorised modifications to engines or exhaust systems without proper approval and documentation.

Be mindful of noise levels at family campsites and sandy outskirts, where enforcement has been active.

Report genuinely disruptive vehicles through official channels to help authorities maintain peace in your neighbourhood.

Broader trend: UAE tightens traffic enforcement







Abu Dhabi is doubling down on road safety and community peace with an intensified campaign against noisy driving and disruptive vehicles, issuing stern warnings and sharp penalties that are now top of mind for motorists across the emirate. As authorities push for safer, quieter streets, drivers are being reminded that excessively loud vehicles that are often the result of unauthorised modifications or reckless behaviour, can carry a hefty Dh2,000 fine and 12 black traffic points, along with other legal consequences under UAE law.The Abu Dhabi Police have publicly stressed that loud, roaring engines and other forms of disruptive driving are not just annoyances, they are public safety concerns. Noise from vehicles can disrupt residents, particularly in family neighbourhoods and sandy outskirts, causing distress to children, the elderly and individuals with medical sensitivities.This enforcement effort comes as part of a broader push to curb reckless driving, curb noise pollution and promote courteous behaviour on the roads. Officers have specifically targeted drivers, often younger motorists, operating vehicles with modified exhausts, unleashed engines or ritually revving machines in residential districts, family campsites and sandy zones near homes.Under Article 20 of the Traffic and Circulation Law, motorists who operate vehicles that cause excessive noise face a Dh2,000 fine and a deduction of 12 black points from their driving licence if found violating the law. These penalties can significantly impact a driver’s record and insurance eligibility over time.In addition to fines for noise, police are also cracking down on unauthorised modifications to engines or chassis, another major contributor to sound pollution. Drivers who make such modifications without approval may face a Dh1,000 fine, 12 traffic points and possible impoundment of their vehicle for up to 30 days under Law No. 5 of 2020. Vehicles impounded for illegal modifications can only be released after paying a Dh10,000 release fee, and if left unclaimed for three months, they may be auctioned off.Authorities have backed up these warnings with action. In a coordinated enforcement operation in Al Ain in early 2025, police seized 106 vehicles found to have excessive modifications that caused loud noise disturbances, highlighting that enforcement isn’t limited to warnings alone but includes real consequences for violators.Officials frame this crackdown as about more than just reducing noise. It is part of enhancing road safety, community wellbeing and traffic order. Loud vehicles and reckless driving habits can distract other road users, potentially increasing the risk of accidents. Noise pollution is also broadly seen as an “uncivilised behaviour” that tarnishes the image of neighbourhoods and disrupts day-to-day life.Abu Dhabi Police have actively encouraged members of the public to report noisy or disruptive vehicles by calling the emergency number (999). This community-assisted approach emphasizes that residents have a role to play in shaping safer, quieter streets.Loud cars and vehicle modifications have become increasingly popular among certain driving enthusiast groups in the UAE, especially those who enjoy customised engines and aftermarket upgrades. However, police have repeatedly reminded motorists that unauthorised enhancements that amplify noise or alter performance are against the law and subject to penalties.Online discussions from local drivers reflect mixed feelings about the enforcement. Some argue that normal engine sounds from stock vehicles should not count as violations, while others emphasize responsible driving behaviour, particularly in residential zones where noise can cause anxiety and stress.RedditIf you drive in Abu Dhabi or plan to visit from another emirate, here’s how to ensure you avoid a hefty fine and black points on your licence:Ultimately, the new enforcement marks a shift towards prioritising everyone’s right to a safe, peaceful environment. Whether you live in a bustling neighbourhood or pass through Abu Dhabi’s streets on the way to work or leisure, these rules remind drivers that personal enjoyment should never come at the expense of public safety and community harmony.As 2026 unfolds, road users in Abu Dhabi, from enthusiastic petrolheads to daily commuters, will be keen to adapt to these measures, ensuring that the emirate’s streets are not just free-flowing but also free from unnecessary noise and disruption.Abu Dhabi’s increasingly stringent approach is part of a wider UAE trend of enhancing road rules and penalties for a variety of traffic violations, from dangerous manoeuvres to excessive vehicle noise. Across the country, authorities actively use technology and patrols to enforce regulations and educate drivers on safety best practices","Abu Dhabi is doubling down on road safety and community peace with an intensified campaign against noisy driving and disruptive vehicles. Motorists who operate vehicles that cause excessive noise face a Dh2,000 fine and a deduction of 12 black points from their driving licence. Police are also cracking down on unauthorised modifications to engines or chassis, another major contributor to sound pollution.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126336365,imgsize-47910,width-400,resizemode-4/from-family-areas-to-desert-camps-where-abu-dhabi-is-enforcing-its-noisy-vehicle-rules.jpg"

Dubai bans beloved BBQ tradition at Jebel Hafeet: Is this overreach?



Barbecue Tradition Meets a Hard Stop at Jebel Hafeet in Dubai: Here’s What’s Changed





Dubai-area officials have introduced a new rule that is catching weekend warriors and outdoor lovers by surprise. Barbecues are now banned in several parking areas at Jebel Hafeet in Al Ain, one of the UAE’s most beloved mountain getaways. Visitors caught lighting up grills in prohibited spots can face fines that escalate with repeated violations, up to Dh4,000 on the third offence, as authorities clamp down on littering and misuse of the scenic site.Jebel Hafeet, with its dramatic mountain road, sprawling views and family-friendly Green Mubazzarah Park, attracts hundreds of thousands of residents and tourists each year, especially during the cooler months. However, growing concern over environmental impact and mounting waste left behind by visitors has led the Department of Municipalities and Transport and Al Ain City Municipality to take action. Multiple warning signs placed across several parking lots and popular picnic spots now clearly spell out that “barbecue/BBQ is strictly prohibited in this area. ”The penalty framework comes from Law No. 2 of 2012 concerning the Preservation of Public Appearance, Health and Tranquility in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, which imposes a Dh1,000 fine for first-time non-compliance, Dh2,000 for repeated violations and Dh4,000 for subsequent offences, giving authorities a stronger tool to protect the area’s natural beauty and visitor experience.For generations, gatherings around BBQs at scenic venues like Jebel Hafeet have been a weekend staple for UAE families and friends, with visitors often packing food and grills to enjoy the cool mountain air. However, the new restrictions echo past efforts in the region to preserve sensitive outdoor sites as similar rules have been enforced at deserts and parks where litter and irresponsible fire use posed environmental and safety risks.Local social media discussions reflect mixed reactions. Some people lament the loss of a beloved tradition, while others point to the environmental cost of charcoal waste and litter left behind after picnics, noting that stricter enforcement may be necessary to safeguard delicate mountain ecosystems and keep the area inviting for future visitors.While barbecuing on Jebel Hafeet’s parking lots and roadside spots is now off-limits, authorities consistently remind residents and tourists that designated areas in public parks across Abu Dhabi, including Al Sulaimi and Al Mebrazah parks, still permit BBQ gatherings in a responsible and regulated way.In short, if you are planning a scenic winter outing to Jebel Hafeet this season, portable or personal grills need to be left at home or limited to official BBQ zones. The ban aims to balance enjoyment of the mountain’s natural charm with preserving the environment and ensuring that everyone can continue to enjoy the stunning landscape for many years to come.","Dubai-area officials have introduced a new rule that is catching weekend warriors and outdoor lovers by surprise.

Wider implications for families









From January 9, schools across the UAE will shorten Fridays, allowing students from kindergarten to grade 12 to leave earlier.

For Cycle 1 students, covering grades 1 to 4, schools will use staggered schedules to manage classroom and transport logistics:These changes are designed to allow parents enough time to pick up their children and attend Friday prayers without rushing, while still completing the required curriculum hours.For students in Cycles 2 and 3, which include grades 6 to 12, the Ministry has announced separate timings for boys and girls:In addition, schools may offer online learning for students in Grade 6 and above on Fridays. Such arrangements require consultation with parents and approval from the Knowledge and Human Development Authority (KHDA).

KHDA emphasized that schools have the flexibility to implement staggered or phased dismissal arrangements to meet operational and academic needs while minimizing disruption to teaching and learning.While the change is mainly aligned with religious timings, parents note that it also affects daily routines beyond the classroom. Earlier dismissal impacts traffic flow, workplace arrangements, and childcare schedules. Families particularly feel the pressure in the short window between school pick-up and Friday prayers, highlighting the practical ripple effects of the new timing.KHDA officially described the move as a careful balance between student's overall well-being and curriculum requirements, ensuring that learning continues effectively while also giving families the opportunity to participate in Friday prayers.","From January 9, schools across the UAE will shorten Fridays, allowing students from kindergarten to grade 12 to leave earlier.

Today's UAE weather alert

Kyiv On Edge After Putin’s Kherson Revenge Warning; Ukraine Army 'Sounds Alert'

Today’s weather will be fair to partly cloudy, with humid nights and mornings increasing fog potential.

Winds are expected to be light to moderate, becoming fresh to strong over the sea, potentially lifting dust.

Sea conditions will vary from moderate to rough in the Arabian Gulf and slight in the Oman Sea.

Sunday, January 4 is expected to be dusty and partly cloudy with stronger northwesterly winds (up to ~50 km/h) and reduced visibility due to blowing sand and dust.

Monday and Tuesday may again see fog and mist formation at night and early morning in western internal areas.

Impact on travel

Expect horizontal visibility to drop sharply, sometimes close to zero.

Drive slower, maintain safe distances, and be prepared for sudden low-visibility pockets.

Watch for changing winds that can introduce blowing dust, especially near highways and open deserts.





If you are planning an early start this Saturday, January 3, 2026, you might want to double-check your windows first. This atmospheric ""whiteout"" isn't just a scenic morning view; it is a serious safety concern.The NCM warns that the combination of high humidity and specific pressure systems is creating the perfect recipe for dense mist. Whether you are in the heart of Dubai or commuting through the Abu Dhabi desert, the message from authorities is clear: stay alert and expect the unexpected.The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) has issued a weather advisory for dense fog and significantly reduced visibility in parts of Dubai and some internal and coastal areas of the UAE between midnight and 10 am on January 3, 2026. Drivers and residents should brace for potentially near-zero visibility, especially during early morning travel.=Humidity levels are forecast to rise overnight, creating ideal conditions for fog and mist formation across several regions. The NCM’s alert stresses that these conditions may make driving difficult and hazardous, particularly on highways and open roads at first light.According to the NCM forecast:Looking ahead:These conditions follow past patterns where fog, mist, and dust events frequently recur in the UAE, leading to both safety alerts and traffic adjustments.Authorities are advising motorists to exercise extreme caution:Similar fog alerts have frequently prompted red and yellow warnings in previous fog events, with local police reminding drivers to follow posted speed limits and avoid distractions while navigating foggy roads.While the fog is expected to burn off by mid-morning on Saturday, the weather ""drama"" isn't over. The NCM’s five-day bulletin indicates that the UAE is entering a transition period. As the fog clears, a shift in air pressure will bring stronger northwesterly winds, reaching speeds of up to 50 km/h by Sunday.This means the ""white"" fog will likely be replaced by ""yellow"" dust clouds, further affecting visibility throughout the remainder of the weekend.

The Great Indian Kapil Show,





Indian comedy superstar Kapil Sharma is not just making audiences laugh on screen, he’s now serving up comfort food and café vibes in the Middle East. On December 31, 2025, the comedian and television personality opened Kap’s Cafe in Dubai, marking the hospitality brand’s first foray into the Middle East after earlier launching its first international location in Surrey, Canada.Kap’s Cafe Dubai is not your typical coffee spot. The interior design leans into pastel-heavy hues, muted greens and soft pinks with plush seating and statement lighting, creating a space that is both Instagram-friendly and comfortably familiar. The décor is inspired by the visual language ofthe Netflix hit hosted by Sharma that has become one of India’s most watched comedy series globally, giving fans a sense of walking into the show’s world itself.In social media clips shared by the comedian, Sharma appears smiling, greeting visitors and even serving coffee, much like a host welcoming guests into his home, fitting the café’s relaxed and “comfort first” ethos.While the full Dubai menu has not been officially launched yet, early previews suggest a selection rooted in comfort-driven café classics. Fans can likely expect a mix of Indian and Western favourites, similar to the offerings at the Canada location, including:The inclusion of jaggery-infused lime juice, in particular, gives the café a signature drink that speaks to Sharma’s roots and personal taste, making the experience feel less like a corporate chain and more like a beloved local hangout with celebrity charm.The Dubai café opened its doors from 4 pm to midnight on New Year’s Eve, positioning itself as a cosy alternative to the city’s louder nightlife and a welcoming space for Delhi-to-Dubai travellers, fans of the Netflix series and coffee lovers alike. Located in the Al Kifaf area, Kap’s Cafe joins a growing list of celebrity-linked hospitality ventures in the UAE, a market known for its diverse food scene and appetite for global flavours.Kap’s Cafe’s expansion comes amid a backdrop of challenges for the brand. Last year, the Canada location in Surrey made headlines after facing multiple shooting incidents, including three attacks over several months in 2025. Despite these setbacks, the Dubai launch demonstrates Sharma’s resilience and confidence in growing his hospitality venture internationally.The Dubai opening does not just reflect a culinary expansion, it illustrates how celebrities are blending entertainment, personal branding and lifestyle experiences. By drawing inspiration froma Netflix series that has gained traction and viewership across borders, Kap’s Cafe lets fans step into the world of their favourite comedian, turning casual dining into a form of pop-culture engagement.In a city famed for megaprojects and world-class dining, Kap’s Cafe stands out by offering a comfortable, personality-driven space that promises laughter, nostalgia and heartwarming food, all wrapped in the vibe of one of India’s most iconic comedy voices.","Kapil Sharma opened Kap's Cafe in Dubai on December 31, 2025.

Ask Dhirendra: 'How do I decide how much to save and invest when my income is just about enough?',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/mutual-funds/ask-dhirendra-how-do-i-decide-how-much-to-save-and-invest-when-my-income-is-just-about-enough/articleshow/126072787.cms,"The problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save. (AI image)

“How do I decide how much to save and invest when my income is just about enough?”

What can you save today without breaking your life? How can you make that number grow every year?

Where does a typical salary go?

Some expenses are non-negotiable (rent, basic food, fees).

Some are negotiable but important (a modest phone, occasional eating out).

Some are pure leakage (unused subscriptions, impulsive orders, “I don’t even remember what this was”).

From spare change to serious money

Step up your SIP before you step up your lifestyle

First, add up your genuine essentials: rent/EMI, groceries, utilities, fees, basic transport.

Next, be realistic and add a modest amount for discretionary spending that you know you’ll do anyway – because you are human, not a robot.

See what is left. From that leftover, commit to a percentage – even 10% of your take-home income – as a non-negotiable saving and investing amount. Set up automatic transfers and SIPs for that right after your salary date.

If you have any queries for Dhirendra Kumar you can drop us an email at: toi.business@timesinternet.in

(Dhirendra Kumar is Founder and CEO of Value Research)

This is one of those questions that sounds technical, but is actually very emotional.On paper, it’s simple: income comes in, expenses go out, and whatever is left is “savings. In real life, income comes in, rent, EMIs, school fees, petrol, Swiggy, Zomato, sale on Myntra, birthday gifts, one sudden expense… and at the end of the month, you look at your balance and say, “I’ll start investing from next month. Pakka.”Next month looks surprisingly similar.So let’s start with an honest admission: for most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.At Value Research, whenever we look at this, we don’t begin with a number like “you must save 30%”. We start with a different idea: savings are not what is left after spending. Savings are what you decide first; spending adjusts after that if you flip this order, the maths – and your behaviour – changes completely.A good rule of thumb for many middle-class households is to allocate 20–30% of their take-home income to savings and investments. However, I also know that for many people today, 30% sounds like a bad joke. So instead of fighting over the “ideal” number, let’s work with two simpler questions:To answer the first question, you need to know where your money is actually going, not where you think it is going.For one or two months, track your expenses honestly – not for Instagram, for yourself. You don’t need an app; even a simple notebook or spreadsheet works.Once you see your own pie chart, three things usually stand out:Your first “investment” might simply be plugging two or three leaks. Even if that frees up only ₹2,000–₹3,000 a month, that is your starting SIP.Now let’s look at how “small” that really is.When we run these numbers at Value Research in our retirement and goal calculators, the results are always the same: the gap between zero and small is far bigger than the gap between small and perfect.But what if your income truly is at the survival stage? There are people for whom even ₹2,000 is a luxury some months. If that’s your reality, you have two parallel jobs. One is to create a tiny habit – even ₹500 or ₹1,000 a month into a recurring deposit or a conservative fund. The absolute amount is less important than the mental switch from “I’ll save if anything is left” to “I will save something, and then I will live on the rest. ”The second job is to make sure that as your income grows, your lifestyle doesn’t expand at the same speed. This is where a lot of middle-class Indians quietly sabotage themselves. Every salary increase automatically becomes a better phone, nicer meals out, upgraded gadgets, and bigger car loans. The percentage saved stays the same, or sometimes even falls.A very powerful habit – one we often build into plans at Value Research – is the “step-up”. Each year, when your salary goes up, you increase your SIPs and savings before you upgrade anything else.In many examples we’ve run, the step-up strategy leads to a dramatically higher corpus at the end, without you ever feeling an acute “sacrifice” in any single year. You just avoid letting every pay hike leak out into lifestyle.Now, how do you decide your own number?Here’s a simple approach:If that number feels tight, start a little lower and promise yourself one thing: every time your income goes up, your savings rate will go up faster than your spending.At Value Research, when we build long-term plans, we don’t assume people will suddenly start saving 40% from next month. We assume they will start somewhere realistic, and then we design step-ups. The rigour is in the process, not in some magical starting number.One last point. Many people postpone investing because they are embarrassed by how small their starting amount looks. Please don’t underestimate the psychological power of seeing a small, growing pile that you started and maintained. It changes how you think about yourself: from “I can’t save” to “I am someone who always saves something.” That identity is worth more than one extra dinner out.So how much should you save and invest when your income feels just about enough? The honest answer is: start with whatever you can without lying to yourself, protect that amount like you protect your rent, and then make sure it rises every time your income increases. The “right” number is not what a formula says; it’s the number you will actually stick to for the next 20 years.The perfect percentage can wait. The first rupee cannot.","Dhirendra Kumar: For most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough. A good rule of thumb for many middle-class households is to allocate 20–30% of their take-home income.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126072870,imgsize-47970,width-400,resizemode-4/saving-and-investing.jpg"

Nominee vs legal heir: What is the difference and who has claim on assets? All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/faq/nominee-vs-legal-heir-what-is-the-difference-and-who-has-claim-on-assets-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/125130453.cms,"AI image

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

What is Dubai's Smart Rental Index?



Why are rent hikes in Dubai regulated in the first place?

Dubai Rent Increases Decoded: What Landlords Don’t Always Tell Tenants

How rent increase limits are calculated in Dubai



0% increase: If your current rent is up to 10% below the market average

5% increase: If it’s 11% to 20% below average

10% increase: If it’s 21% to 30% below average

15% increase: If it’s 31% to 40% below average

20% increase: If it’s more than 40% below average

Step-by-step: How to check if your rent increase is legal in Dubai



Visit the official DLD Rent Index page on the Dubai Land Department website. Enter your Title Deed number or manually key in your property details (area, number of rooms, contract expiry date and current annual rent). The tool calculates the average rent for similar properties nearby. It then shows the maximum legal rent increase allowed under the index bands.

What to do if your Dubai landlord demands too much



Present the official index result to the landlord in writing or via email.

Negotiate based on the legal maximum rather than the landlord’s figure.

File a complaint with the Rental Dispute Centre (RDC) at the Dubai Land Department, where the index can be used as statutory evidence to challenge unfair increases.

Bottom line: Rent transparency in Dubai







As Dubai’s rental market continues to evolve amid strong demand and population growth, tenants often grapple with rising rents and the question: Is this rent increase even legal ? Fortunately, the Dubai Land Department’s Smart Rental Index, an AI-powered official tool, now gives residents a clear way to check whether a rent hike proposed by a landlord is justified under UAE law.Whether you are renewing your lease, debating negotiations or simply planning your budget, understanding how rent hikes are regulated in Dubai is essential. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how the system works and how tenants can protect themselves from arbitrary increases.At the core of Dubai’s rent regulation framework is the Smart Rental Index, a sophisticated tool developed by the Dubai Land Department (DLD) to determine fair rental values across the emirate. Unlike the older system, which was updated annually by broad district averages, the Smart Index uses AI and detailed building-level data, including construction quality, services, maintenance standards and location, to produce real-time average rent figures for specific buildings and neighbourhoods.The index covers all residential areas of Dubai, including freehold communities and leasehold zones and helps both tenants and landlords benchmark rental rates against current market conditions.Under Dubai’s tenancy laws (including Decree No. 43 of 2013 and subsequent DLD regulations), landlords cannot arbitrarily raise rent each year. Instead, rent increases are permitted only during lease renewal and only if the Smart Rental Index supports the hike.Importantly, landlords must also provide tenants with a written notice at least 90 days before the expiry of the tenancy contract if they wish to raise rent or change any contract terms. Failing to provide this notice makes the increase invalid under the law, even if the index allows it.These rules are designed to promote market transparency and protect tenants from sudden, excessive rent hikes that could destabilise household finances.Dubai’s rent increase system sets strict limits on how much landlords can legally increase rent, based on how the tenant’s current rent compares with the average market rent shown in the Smart Rental Index -These bands help ensure that rent adjustments are fair and reflect genuine market trends rather than landlord discretion. They are automatically applied by the Smart Rental Index tool when you perform a legal rent check.Tenants in Dubai can easily verify whether a proposed rent increase complies with the official rules by using the online rent calculator provided by the Dubai Land Department:You can access this service via the Dubai REST app, the DLD website under e-services or the DubaiNow app, all of which provide the same official data. Once you have the result, you can print or screenshot the official calculation to use in negotiations with your landlord or, if needed, as evidence in a dispute.If your landlord proposes a rent increase that exceeds the legal limit shown by the Smart Rental Index or fails to give the mandatory 90-day notice, you have options:Tenants have successfully used this process to keep their rent at current levels when the index shows no increase is allowed, demonstrating the tool’s effectiveness.Even if the Smart Rental Index shows your rent qualifies for an increase, the landlord must still serve at least 90 days’ written notice before your tenancy expires. If they don’t, the increase is invalid by law and your rent must remain unchanged for the next contract period.This dual requirement, both index eligibility and timely notice, protects tenants from both unjustified and procedural rent hikes.The Smart Rental Index is not just a protective tool for tenants, it also helps landlords justify their pricing based on clear market data.

Spotify Adds ‘Listening Activity’ and ‘Request to Jam’ features: Here’s how they work,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/spotify-adds-listening-activity-and-request-to-jam-features-heres-how-they-work/articleshow/126399955.cms,"Listening activity on Spotify



Here’s how it works



Users can turn on listening activity via Privacy and social settings, accessible through the side drawer next to the “View profile” button.



Once enabled, activity appears in the chat row of the side drawer and at the top of Messages chats.



If a user taps on their friend or family member’s listening activity, they’ll be able to add tracks to their library, start playback, open the track’s context menu, or react with one of six standard emojis.

Request to jam



Here’s how it works



From a Messages chat, Premium users can tap Jam in the top right corner to send a request for a remote Jam.



Your friend will receive the request and can either accept or decline.



If accepted, the recipient becomes the host of the Jam session. From there, both participants in the Jam can add tracks to a shared queue and listen together.





Spotify has rolled out a new Listening Activity feature which enable users to share what they are streaming in realtime with friends and family via Spotify Messages. Along with this, the music streaming service has also rolled out a Request to Jam feature, a way for Premium users to invite friends into shared listening sessions directly from Messages. “Today, we’re building on that experience with two new Messages features: Listening activity and Request to Jam. Listening activity gives users a real-time look at what music their friends and family are listening to, while Request to Jam makes it easy to quickly turn those moments into shared listening sessions,” the company said in an official blog post.If a user isn’t actively listening, their most recently played track will appear instead. Friends can tap on the activity to add songs to their library, start playback, open the track menu, or react with emojis. Importantly, the feature is opt‑in, giving users full control over whether their listening activity is visible.Listening activity is only shared with people you’ve already messaged on Spotify, and you’re always in control—only the contacts you choose can see your activity, and you can turn it off at any time.“To complement listening activity, we’re making it easier to turn musical moments into shared experiences with Request to Jam, a new way for users to invite friends or family they’re connected with in Messages into a live listening session,” added Spotify.Once accepted, the recipient becomes host of the Jam, and both participants can add tracks to a joint playlist, listen together, and chat in sync. Free users can join a Jam when invited by a Premium subscriber, making the feature accessible to a wider audience. Spotify noted that daily active users of Jam have more than doubled year‑over‑year, highlighting strong demand for collaborative listening.","Spotify has rolled out a new Listening Activity feature which enable users to share what they are streaming in realtime with friends and family via Spotify Messages.
