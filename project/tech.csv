“Driving the Future of Transport and Global Connectivity,”





Etihad Rail’s ambitious passenger train project took center stage at the Global Rail 2025 exhibition in Abu Dhabi, where visitors got their first close look at the soon-to-be operational service set to redefine intercity travel across the UAE. The event, held at ADNEC Centre, gathered international leaders and experts to spotlight innovation and cooperation in transport and connectivity.The Global Rail 2025 exhibition and conference opened today at ADNEC Centre Abu Dhabi and will continue through October 2. Held under the themethe event has drawn significant international attention, welcoming over 20 ministerial delegations and industry leaders from both the public and private sectors. With participants from more than 100 nationalities, the three-day gathering is expected to receive over 20,000 international visitors.Spanning four exhibition halls, the event features more than 200 companies and brands from 14 key sectors, including infrastructure, rolling stock, digital innovation, finance, and smart mobility. Over 70 companies are debuting at this year’s exhibition, and more than 11 national rail operators are in attendance.A major highlight of the exhibition has been Etihad Rail’s unveiling of its upcoming passenger train cabins—marking the first public look into what the future of rail travel in the UAE will look like. The sleek, silver train model displayed prominently at the venue features the distinctive black and red Etihad Rail branding and gives visitors a tangible preview of what’s to come when passenger operations begin in 2026.The passenger trains will include three distinct travel classes: economy, family, and first class. The economy cabin features dark grey, back-to-back seating; the family cabin offers face-to-face seats with a long central table for group convenience; and the first-class cabin provides wider, adjustable seats designed for comfort. All cabins come equipped with tray tables, overhead luggage compartments, and additional dedicated spaces for larger baggage.Passengers will enter stations through automated ticket barriers. While it is encouraged to book tickets online in advance, ticket vending machines will also be available at stations. A sample of the machine on display shows it as black and grey in color, with support for payments via bank notes, cards, and Apple Pay. These machines allow users to choose their travel class, input journey start and end points, and specify any special requirements.Train journeys are designed to be swift and efficient. Once operational, the Abu Dhabi to Dubai route will take 57 minutes. Travel time to Fujairah will be around 100 minutes, and to Ruwais, approximately 70 minutes. The trains are expected to run at speeds of up to 200 km/h.Two types of trains will operate on the network. Chinese-manufactured CRC cabins will offer 365 seats, while Spanish CAF cabins will provide 369 seats. Though both models support the same class structure, slight design variations will differentiate the two interiors.The railway service is also making efforts to create a seamless and branded customer experience. Train drivers will wear grey and black uniforms, while station and train hosts will don cream and red uniforms.As excitement builds for Etihad Rail’s full-scale passenger operations, one detail still remains under wraps: ticket pricing. Additionally, specifics regarding last-mile connectivity options for passengers have yet to be disclosed.Nevertheless, the unveiling marks a significant step forward in the UAE’s long-term infrastructure and mobility plans, offering residents and visitors an efficient and comfortable alternative to road transport.","Etihad Rail's passenger trains, launching in 2026, will connect Abu Dhabi to Dubai in 57 minutes.

What OpenAI says





Elon Musk-owned AI software company, xAI has filed a lawsuit against Sam Altman-led OpenAI , accusing it of stealing its trade secrets. The lawsuit, filed in a federal court in California, says that OpenAI was engaged in a “deeply troubling pattern” of hiring away former xAI employees to gain access to trade secrets. It further accuses OpenAI of pursuing unfair advantage in the AI race. In the lawsuit, xAI names four former engineers – Xuechen Li who is involved in a separate trade secrets lawsuit, Jimmy Fraiture and a senior finance executive.“OpenAI is targeting those individuals with knowledge of xAI’s key technologies and business plans, including xAI’s source code and its operational advantages in launching data centers, then inducing those employees to breach their confidentiality and other obligations to xAI through unlawful means,” the lawsuit states.“By hook or by crook, OpenAI clearly will do anything when threatened by a better innovator, including plundering and misappropriating the technical advancements, source code, and business plans of xAI,” the lawsuit claims.“OpenAI is not merely soliciting or hiring a competitor’s employees. OpenAI is waging a coordinated, unfair, and unlawful campaign: OpenAI is targeting those individuals with knowledge of xAI’s key technologies and business plans—including xAI’s source code and its operational advantages in launching data centers—then inducing those employees to breach their confidentiality and other obligations to xAI through unlawful means,” it states.OpenAI has rejected the allegations, dismissing the lawsuit as “the latest chapter in Mr. Musk’s ongoing harassment.”Notably, Elon Musk has had a complex relationship with OpenAI — from co-founding the company with Sam Altman and Greg Brockman, to becoming one of its strongest critics and now a business rival.In August, Musk filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and Apple, accusing Apple of giving ChatGPT preferential treatment in App Store rankings.Musk has also taken OpenAI to court, alleging it put profits ahead of its original mission of developing AI for humanity’s benefit. OpenAI, in turn, has countersued Musk, accusing him of harassment."," xAI has filed a lawsuit against Sam Altman-led OpenAI, accusing it of stealing its trade secrets.

UAE: Getting married in Abu Dhabi? Here’s everything you need to know about Civil Marriage Law,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-getting-married-in-abu-dhabi-heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-civil-marriage-law/articleshow/124227630.cms,"Skip the stress, keep the romance: Civil Marriage Abu Dhabi

Who can marry in Abu Dhabi? Eligibility and legal framework



How to apply and what documents you need



The ceremony, legal effect and practical aftercare

Why expatriates are choosing Abu Dhabi for civil marriage

Legal benefits and global recognition of Abu Dhabi civil marriage





Abu Dhabi’s civil marriage service lets couples solemnize a legally recognized, secular marriage at the Abu Dhabi Civil Family Court under Law No. 14 of 2021. The service is open to most residents and visitors (with a key exception for Muslim UAE nationals) and is designed to be fast, internationally recognised and simple to navigate. If you’re planning to marry in Abu Dhabi, here’s a clear, practical guide to who can apply, what to prepare, how the ceremony works, the fees and why the reform matters for expatriates.Abu Dhabi’s civil-marriage scheme is governed by Abu Dhabi Law No. 14 of 2021 and applies to people regardless of religion or nationality, except for UAE nationals who are Muslims they remain subject to Sharia-based family law. Applicants must be at least 18 years old, give mutual consent, must not be married to someone else, and must not be related within the first or second degree. Tourists and non-residents can apply online and must travel to Abu Dhabi for the ceremony once approved. The move to allow civil marriage grew from wider UAE reforms introduced since 2021 to provide non-religious personal-status options and align with international norms.Couples can submit applications through the Abu Dhabi Judicial Department’s online portal or at authorised typing centres. The core documents are passports (and Emirates ID if resident), a completed application form, and proof that any prior marriage has been legally dissolved (divorce decree or death certificate).A prenuptial agreement is optional. There are two service tracks: the standard service (about AED 300, processed within roughly 10 working days) and an express option (around AED 2,500) that can be processed in one working day and lets couples choose the ceremony date. After approval, the court schedules the ceremony at its Civil Family Court.On the ceremony day both parties attend the Abu Dhabi Civil Family Court with IDs; no external witnesses are required because the civil marriage officer serves as the legal witness. Vows are played via a pre-recorded audio available in multiple languages, though couples can exchange rings, recite their own vows and bring guests or a photographer. After signing, the marriage certificate is legally binding; many couples choose to have the certificate attested by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for overseas use and embassy recognition. The process is intentionally straightforward to ensure the marriage is widely accepted by foreign authorities.Abu Dhabi has emerged as a preferred destination for non-Muslim expatriates and mixed-nationality couples seeking to formalize their unions legally. For many, coming from countries with strict marriage laws, religious restrictions, or cumbersome bureaucratic processes, Abu Dhabi offers a simpler, faster, and transparent system. Unlike traditional procedures that may require approval from multiple authorities or religious institutions, the civil marriage framework in Abu Dhabi allows couples to complete the process efficiently through a single legal channel.The system is particularly appealing for couples who previously faced hurdles due to differences in religion or nationality. Expats report that the process is streamlined, well-documented, and predictable, reducing both time and administrative stress. By providing a legally recognized, state-backed platform, Abu Dhabi has become a go-to destination for couples who want their marriage to be valid, hassle-free, and compliant with international legal standards.One of the biggest draws of Abu Dhabi’s civil marriage system is its legal robustness and international recognition. Marriage certificates issued here are accepted in most countries worldwide, making them highly valuable for practical purposes such as visa applications, bank accounts, inheritance rights, and other family law matters.This global validity ensures that couples do not face disputes or complications when moving, working, or studying abroad. The civil certificate also acts as a formal proof of marital status, recognized by governments and institutions alike, which can simplify processes like sponsorship for spouses, property ownership, and social benefits. For expatriates, having a legally enforceable marriage document from Abu Dhabi provides peace of mind, ensuring that their rights and obligations are protected both locally and internationally.","Abu Dhabi’s civil marriage service lets couples solemnize a legally recognized, secular marriage at the Abu Dhabi Civil Family Court.

As schools reopen in Abu Dhabi for the 2025–26 academic year, a major update in student transport policy by the Department of Education and Knowledge (ADEK) is taking effect, and every parent needs to be prepared. From who can pick up your child, to whether they can ride a scooter to school, these new rules are detailed, safety-focused, and carry clear responsibilities for families. Here's a breakdown of everything you must know as the school run begins.One of the most significant updates affects older students. Starting this academic year, students in Cycle 3 (Grades 9–12, ages 14–18) are allowed to commute independently to and from school without using school transport. This includes the use of bicycles, scooters, or other personal transport — as long as certain conditions are met.However, parents must sign a detailed consent form that confirms:If a school does allow the use of personal vehicles like bikes or scooters on its premises, it must provide dedicated infrastructure, including tracks and parking spaces. Schools also retain the right to regulate how and where these are used within the campus.Important: The school is not liable for any incidents that occur while the student is commuting independently — this responsibility falls to the parents.For students under 15, independent travel is not allowed. These students must be picked up and dropped off by an adult, either a parent or a parent-appointed guardian. If no adult is present at the drop-off point, the child will be taken back to school after all other students are dropped off.However, there's some flexibility if you have older children:This system ensures that younger children are never left unsupervised during transit, while giving families a practical option when an adult isn’t available for pick-up.School buses are strictly reserved for student transportation. However, for field trips, tourist buses may be used, as long as they meet technical and safety standards like:The maximum allowable time for a school bus journey is 60 minutes — from the first pick-up point to the last drop-off. Students can only be picked up and dropped off at pre-designated locations.For students under 11, a bus supervisor must ensure that a parent or appointed guardian is present at the drop-off point. If no one is available, the student will be returned to school.Each bus carrying students under age 11 must have a registered supervisor, in addition to a driver. Both the driver and supervisor must hold ITC permits.Bus transport fees are regulated and must align with the ITC School Bus Fee Framework. Operators propose the fee, which must be approved by ADEK. Any exceptional increases require prior coordination with ITC.To help parents stay informed and reassured, schools will use Salama — a school transport monitoring application developed by the Integrated Transport Centre (ITC) of Abu Dhabi. This app is designed to enhance school bus safety by offering parents full visibility into their child’s daily commute.Through Salama, parents can:The bus supervisor must maintain regular communication with both parents and the school, and is responsible for:Every school must appoint a School Transport Coordinator, whose contact information must be shared with parents and bus operators. This person is the main contact for any issue that goes beyond the bus supervisor’s duties, including:Schools are required to implement traffic control plans for safe pick-up and drop-off:The updated school transport policy by ADEK is not just a set of rules, it’s a framework to ensure every child’s journey to and from school is safe, structured, and well-supervised.Whether your child is taking the school bus, riding a scooter, or getting picked up by an older sibling, there are clear expectations and shared responsibilities between schools, parents, and students.To stay compliant, and ensure your child’s safety, make sure to:","Abu Dhabi schools reopen for the 2025–26 academic year.

Reminder for travelers: No power banks allowed on Emirates flights from October 1,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/reminder-for-travelers-no-power-banks-allowed-on-emirates-flights-from-october-1/articleshow/124229500.cms,"Emirates bans in-flight use of power banks from October 1, citing safety risks and industry incidents/Image: Emirates

What the new Emirates policy says





Here are the full details of the policy

Emirates customers may carry one power bank that is under 100 Watt Hours.

Power banks may not be used to charge any personal devices onboard.

Charging a power bank using the aircraft’s power supply is not permitted.

All power banks accepted for transport must have capacity rating information available.

Power banks may not be placed in the overhead stowage bin onboard the aircraft and must now be placed in the seat pocket or in a bag under the seat in front of you.

Power banks are not permitted in checked luggage (existing rule).

Why Emirates is introducing this ban

Emirates responds to industry trends and battery related incidents

What passengers need to know before flying

Pre-charge all devices before arriving at the airport.

Use the aircraft’s in-seat charging points (where available) instead of personal power banks.

Verify the watt-hour rating on your power bank; it must be under 100 Wh and clearly marked.

Store the power bank in the seat pocket or under-seat bag, not in the overhead compartment.

Never place power banks in checked baggage.

Comply with all crew instructions regarding battery handling and safety.

FAQs:

Q. Can I still bring a power bank on my Emirates flight?

Q. Where should I store my power bank during the flight?

Q. Can I pack my power bank in my checked luggage?

Q. Will Emirates

provide alternatives to charge my devices in-flight?





Starting October 1, 2025, Emirates will strictly ban the use of power banks on all its flights. Passengers can still carry one power bank under 100Wh in their carry-on but are prohibited from using or charging it during the flight. Travelers are advised to follow the new rules closely to avoid inconvenience.Under the revised guidelines, passengers on Emirates flights will be allowed to carry only one power bank in their hand luggage, subject to specific safety requirements. However, using power banks onboard will no longer be permitted in any form.Passengers are advised to keep the power bank within reach, allowing cabin crew to respond quickly in the event of overheating or malfunction.The ban stems from safety assessments and growing global concern over lithium-ion battery hazards, particularly those associated with portable power banks. Lithium-ion and lithium-polymer batteries, the core components of most power banks, are known to carry thermal runaway risks, a phenomenon where a battery’s temperature increases uncontrollably, potentially leading to fire, explosion, or toxic gas release.The underlying mechanism involves lithium ions moving through an electrolyte between two electrodes. If the battery is overcharged, physically damaged, or manufactured without proper safeguards, the electrolyte may overheat. In such cases, the battery may undergo thermal runaway, where heat production outpaces heat dissipation, triggering combustion or explosion.Emirates has stated that the risk is particularly high with low-cost or unregulated power banks, which may lack essential safety controls like temperature regulation or automatic shut-off mechanisms.Emirates is not alone in tightening its policy on portable batteries. Other major carriers, such as Singapore Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Korean Air, EVA Air, China Airlines, and AirAsia, have already implemented restrictions on using power banks in-flight.The move follows high-profile safety incidents, including a January 2023 fire on an Air Busan Airbus A321, believed to be caused by a power bank. The incident left 27 passengers injured and led to renewed aviation-sector calls for stricter battery safety protocols.To ensure compliance and avoid last-minute issues at boarding, Emirates recommends that passengers take the following precautions:Passengers who fail to meet the guidelines risk having their power bank confiscated at the gate or denied boarding in extreme cases, as safety takes precedence.Yes, you can bring one power bank under 100Wh in your carry-on, but it must not be used or charged during the flight.Store it in your seat pocket or under the seat, placing it in overhead bins is not permitted.No, placing power banks in checked baggage is strictly prohibited for safety reasons.Yes, you may use the in-seat charging ports available on many Emirates aircraft, but not your own power bank.","Emirates bans in-flight use of power banks from October 1, citing safety risks and industry incidents.

New Visa Rules for Umrah 2025: Saudi Arabia makes hotel and transport pre-booking mandatory for visa approval,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/new-visa-rules-for-umrah-2025-saudi-arabia-makes-hotel-and-transport-pre-booking-mandatory-forvisaapproval/articleshow/124195721.cms,"Saudi tightens Umrah visa rules, Pilgrims must pre-book hotels and transport

Saudi Arabia’s new Umrah visa rules 2025 explained



Step-by-step process to apply for an Umrah visa in 2025



Book your accommodation only with licensed hotels or through a registered and verified operator. Use the official Nusuk Umrah/Nusuk Masar portal or an accredited local travel agency to make a secure and verified reservation; casual or unverified bookings may risk visa delays or outright rejection.

Arrange in-country transport (if required) and obtain confirmation. Many operators now include airport transfers and local transport in Umrah packages; keep receipts and booking references ready for the visa application.

Apply for the Umrah visa via the Nusuk portal or authorized channels. The Nusuk platform consolidates visa application, accommodation verification and permit scheduling; applicants should follow its instructions to avoid third-party bottlenecks.

Work with a vetted and trusted operator if you prefer comprehensive package support. UAE-based tour operators are strongly advising pilgrims to book full packages (hotel + transport + expert guidance) to streamline approvals and ensure reliable on-ground services.

Essential travel tips for pilgrims visiting Makkah and Madinah

What to watch next





Saudi authorities now require Umrah pilgrims to have confirmed hotel bookings and arranged transport when applying for visas, a rule intended to better manage pilgrim movement and prevent fraudulent accommodation offers. Umrah operators in the UAE are already urging travelers to complete these bookings preferably through Saudi’s official Nusuk platform or licensed agents before submitting visa applications.From this year, the Saudi Ministry of Hajj and Umrah and related authorities have tightened entry rules so that visa approval depends on proof of approved accommodation, typically hotel contracts verified through the Nusuk Masar / Nusuk Umrah platform and evidence of local transport arrangements. The move is part of a wider push to digitize and centralize Umrah services, requiring pilgrims to upload or link verified bookings before a visa is issued. Authorities say the change protects pilgrims from scams and improves crowd and accommodation management during busy periods.Expect slightly higher upfront planning costs because verified hotel and transport bookings must be made before visa issuance. Prices vary by season and hotel class; booking early often secures better rates and availability.If you’re flexible, choose off-peak slots and confirm cancellations/refund policies only verified, licensed contracts processed through Nusuk or accredited agents will reliably support visa approval. Operators also recommend allowing extra processing time during peak Islamic calendar dates.The rule tightens quality control and reduces fraud, but it also shifts pre-travel planning responsibility onto pilgrims and travel agents. For Saudi regulators, the change supports Vision 2030 goals to professionalize religious tourism and improve pilgrims’ safety and experience. For travelers, the key takeaway is simple: don’t apply for an Umrah visa without verified hotel and transport bookings, do it early and use Nusuk or licensed operators to avoid hiccups.",Saudi authorities now require Umrah pilgrims to have confirmed hotel bookings and arranged transport when applying for visas.

When to watch: Supermoon and meteor-shower dates for the UAE



Hunter’s Supermoon — October 7, 2025. A bright full moon that will dominate the night sky.

Orionids meteor shower — peaks October 21–22, 2025. Best seen after midnight; this shower produces fast, bright meteors from Halley’s Comet debris.

— peaks October 21–22, 2025. Best seen after midnight; this shower produces fast, bright meteors from Halley’s Comet debris. Beaver / Southern Taurids period & Supermoon — early November (Southern Taurids peak Nov 4–5) and Beaver Supermoon — November 5, 2025. Taurids are slower and produce occasional bright fireballs; the supermoon on Nov 5 will make faint meteors harder to see.

Leonids meteor shower — peaks November 17–18, 2025. Known for quick, bright streaks; best pre-dawn viewing.

Cold Supermoon — December 4, 2025. The last of the three consecutive supermoons.

Geminids meteor shower — peaks December 13–14, 2025. One of the year’s strongest showers (under perfect dark-sky conditions it can produce very high hourly rates and vivid colored trails).

Where to watch: Best UAE stargazing spots and local viewing tips





How to watch and photograph: simple viewing and camera tips that work



Why it matters: a chance for science, community and striking photos

Quick wrap — what to pack and final checklist





The last three months of 2025 promise a rich sky show over the UAE: a run of three supermoons in October, November and December will be joined by major meteor showers - the Orionids, Leonids and Geminids giving skywatchers many clear nights to look up. Below is a compact, practical guide: exact dates, the best UAE spots to watch from, and simple photography and viewing tips so you don’t miss the action.At-a-glance calendar (local dates):(Notes: the term “supermoon” describes a full moon near its closest orbital approach; meteor-shower peaks are typically given as the nights when the highest activity is expected.For clear, memorable views head away from city lights. Popular UAE choices include the Al Qudra Desert, the Liwa dunes, the Hajar foothills and high vantage points such as Jebel Jais locations that give darker horizons and broader sky views than the city. Plan to arrive before dusk, scout a flat, safe spot, and bring warm layers for desert or mountain nights. Local guides and astronomy clubs often organize group viewings around major events, which is a good option if you prefer structured outings.Practical tip: supermoons are bright; they wash out faint meteors, so schedule meteor-watching for nights near new moons when possible (for example, the Orionids’ peak in late October benefits from darker skies).When a supermoon and a meteor peak coincide, expect fewer visible meteors.You don’t need equipment to enjoy the show, lie back, let your eyes dark-adapt for about 20–30 minutes, and scan the whole sky (meteors can appear anywhere). If you want to photograph meteors, use a tripod, shoot in manual mode with a wide-angle lens, open aperture (ideally f/2.8 or the widest your lens allows), a shutter of 10–30 seconds (use the 500/600 rule to avoid star trails) and an ISO in the 1600–3200 range; shoot many consecutive exposures rather than relying on a single long frame. These settings are a good starting point tweak for your camera and conditions. Bring a red torch to preserve night vision and shoot RAW for easier post-processing.If the moon is exceptionally bright (supermoon nights), plan your photography carefully around the moonset or move your focus entirely to detailed lunar photography. The large, glowing moon disk itself makes excellent, dramatic landscape portraits when framed with sweeping dunes or rugged mountain silhouettes.These back-to-back events are not just pretty nights; they are chances to connect with amateur astronomers, gather simple citizen-science observations (report fireballs to regional networks), and capture rare photos. The Geminids in mid-December are a highlight for photographers and families alike; the Orionids and Leonids offer quick, bright streaks that reward patience. In the UAE, where organized skywatching is growing, these events help build a community of observers and bring public attention to light-pollution and dark-sky conservationBring water, blankets or reclining chairs, a warm jacket, a red flashlight, a camera on a tripod (if shooting), and patience. Check local weather and moonrise/moonset times the day before, and follow astronomy-club updates for guided viewings. Clear sky nights in October–December 2025 will reward anyone who makes the short trip out of town.","The last three months of 2025 promise a rich sky show over the UAE.

UAE rolls out AI Platforms to boost Emirati employment and skills; What you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-rolls-out-ai-platforms-to-boost-emirati-employment-and-skills-what-youneedtoknow/articleshow/124180514.cms,"UAE’s new AI Platforms aim to transform Emirati job market and close skills gaps

Massar Al Ghurair explained - AI job-matching, skills mapping and the partners behind it



Emirati Smart Human Resource Platform: A government pilot to streamline hiring and transparency

How the AI works and what that means for jobseekers

Policy, privacy and real-world outcomes

Faster matches, clearer training paths, and a test of governance





The UAE has recently introduced AI-driven platforms aimed at accelerating Emiratization and connecting Emirati jobseekers with training and work opportunities. Two headline moves are the Massar Al Ghurair platform (an AI job-matching and upskilling service launched by the Abdulla Al Ghurair Foundation) and the Emirati Smart Human Resource Platform (a pilot rolled out by the Emirati Human Resources Development Council). Together they use labour-market intelligence, personalized skill-profiles and employer dashboards to make hiring, training and candidate discovery faster and more targeted.Massar Al Ghurair is an AI-powered skills and career platform built to help young nationals discover career paths, identify skills gaps and receive tailored upskilling recommendations plus direct job matches with participating employers. It was publicly launched earlier in 2025 with a live demo at Expo City Dubai. The platform was developed with SkyHive (now part of Cornerstone) and lists partners that include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Strategy& Middle East and Inception (a G42 company). These partnerships supply the cloud, analytics and AI tooling behind the personalized recommendations.Public reporting on the program states it aims to support tens of thousands of learners and connect them with dozens of employers and training providers; figures cited during coverage include targets such as 45,000 learners, 50 employers and 20 training partners in the initial rollouts.Launched as a pilot in late September 2025, the Emirati Smart Human Resource Platform is designed to be an integrated recruitment and skills ecosystem for Emiratis: automated job recommendations, virtual interviews, interactive employer dashboards and real-time reporting on recruitment performance. The platform emphasizes transparency and governance in hiring and is intended to increase Emirati participation across strategic sectors. Unlike a single NGO or private platform, this government-backed tool aims to give regulators and employers a live view of candidate pipelines, responsiveness and sectoral gaps making it easier to coordinate training, quotas and incentives that support national workforce goals (including alignment with long-term strategies such as the UAE Centennial and national economic agendas).Both platforms share the same practical idea: turn raw CVs and course certificates into structured skill-profiles, then use labour-market data and AI to map those profiles to jobs and to recommended training. Practically this means a jobseeker can sign up, get a dynamic “skill passport,” see exactly which short courses or micro-credentials close a gap, and be surfaced to employers whose hiring criteria match their updated profile. Employers get dashboards showing candidate fit, time-to-hire and recruitment responsiveness useful for meeting Emiratisation targets.Quicker job discovery, personalized learning roadmaps, on-the-spot virtual interviews at job fairs, and clearer visibility on which skills local employers actually want. For employers, AI trims the search time and reduces mismatch by flagging candidates with the closest skill fit. Events such as Ru’ya Careers 2025 have already used advanced recruitment tools and on-site tech to connect Emiratis with thousands of roles, illustrating how these platforms will plug into existing hiring channels.If the platforms scale as planned they could materially speed up Emiratization by making training investments more targeted, reducing job-skills mismatch and helping small and large employers find suitable national candidates quickly. The combined NGO, private-sector and government approach also helps create a shared data backbone for workforce planning. AI recommendations are only as good as the data and assumptions behind them. Policymakers and platform teams will need to guard against biased matching, protect candidate data privacy, and ensure that automated shortlists don’t entrench new forms of exclusion. Coverage of related federal HR AI work shows the UAE is already moving fast on AI-driven HR tools but governance and transparency will determine public trust.The UAE’s new AI platforms are a pragmatic response to a well-known challenge: a fast-changing job market with new skills demanded each year. Massar Al Ghurair and the Emirati Smart Human Resource Platform together offer personalized guidance, employer connections and a data-driven way to scale Emiratization but their success will depend on how well they protect candidate data, avoid algorithmic bias, and convert AI leads into actual jobs and long-term career growth.","UAE has introduced AI-driven platforms aimed at accelerating Emiratization and connecting Emirati jobseekers with training and work opportunities.

Error-free UPI transactions: NPCI bans nicknames in UPI payments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/banking/error-free-upi-transactions-npci-bans-nicknames-in-upi-payments-heres-how-it-will-benefit-users/articleshow/120721570.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a significant move to enhance user safety and transparency in digital transactions, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’, as recorded in the Core Banking System (CBS), during peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-merchant (P2PM) transactions.In a circular dated April 24, 2025, the NPCI issued an addendum to its earlier guidelines, mandating UPI apps to ensure that only the bank-registered name of the recipient is shown on the transaction confirmation screen and in the transaction history.The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.According to NPCI, the ""ultimate beneficiary"" is the person or entity receiving funds for services or goods provided. Going forward, names fetched directly from the Validate Address API – the same used to retrieve official bank names, will be the only ones shown to payers. Names derived from QR codes, contact lists, or user-defined labels will no longer be permitted.“This change is being introduced to help customers verify they are sending money to the correct beneficiary and to reduce risks of misdirected payments,” NPCI stated in its communication to UPI ecosystem members.Many UPI apps currently allow users to modify payee display names or generate aliases, making it easier for fraudsters to impersonate trusted brands or individuals. Going forward, this loophole will be shut.NPCI has clearly instructed that apps must disable any feature that allows users to edit or customise beneficiary names within their interfaces.The circular comes amid growing concerns over rising UPI-based frauds, often caused by misleading display names that do not match official records. “This step can drastically reduce accidental transfers and fraudulent transactions. Displaying only the bank-verified name adds a key layer of authentication,” said Rahul Jain, CFO at NTT DATA Payment Services India according to an ET report.The change will particularly impact small merchants who fall under the P2PM category, such as kirana store owners or street vendors, who often receive payments via QR codes embedded with non-official names. Once enforced, customers will be shown only the CBS-registered name, not the store’s brand name or any custom label.“This will bring much-needed clarity for users and reduce errors. It enhances trust and makes the payment ecosystem more secure,” said Atul Gupta, head of risk & compliance at Cashfree Payments.Despite some anticipated transition challenges for users accustomed to aliases or nicknames, experts believe the change is a step in the right direction. As Mukesh Chand, senior counsel at Economic Laws Practice, explained, “It helps reduce anonymity and gives users more confidence before authorising a transaction.”By standardising the way beneficiary names are displayed, NPCI aims to make UPI payments safer, more transparent, and less prone to manipulation.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’ The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.

Google’s New AI Is BANANAS: How To Use Gemini Nano Banana

How Google determined the winners of Nano Banana hackathon







Google DeepMind has announced the 50 winners of its recent Nano Banana Hackathon. The company is awarding the contest winners non-monetary prizes totalling $400,000. The 48-hour competition, which ran from September 6 to September 8, received 832 project submissions. Each of the 50 winning projects received a prize package that included $5,000 in Gemini API credits, $1,000 in Fal credits, and 11 million Eleven Labs credits valued at approximately $2,000. Google also provided a special technology prize for submissions that demonstrated outstanding technical achievement using Eleven Labs or Fal technologies.In a thread of posts shared on the social media platform X (earlier Twitter), Google announced the names and the projects of each winner and wrote:As the name implies, participants were challenged to create a product, application, or demo using Google’s Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model, popularly known as Nano Banana. This new image generation and editing tool, developed by Google, enhances the Gemini app’s editing experience by allowing users to create multiple variations from a single photo or combine ideas from different images.The hackathon went beyond basic text-to-image generation, asking participants to develop innovative concepts, leverage the model’s strengths, and build apps that could power dynamic storytelling, boost e-commerce, automate creative workflows, and enable the next wave of natural language photo editors, according to Google DeepMind.To support this, Google introduced a special Gemini API tier with a limit of 20 images per minute and 500 requests per project daily. Submissions had to be hosted publicly on Kaggle and include a demo video of up to two minutes to showcase the project’s “wow” factor.Entries were judged with 10% weight given to the quality of the demo video, 40% to innovation and the “wow” element, and the remaining points split across technical execution, functionality, and potential impact.Google highlighted several winners in a social media post.

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

Nike ties run deep







Apple CEO Tim Cook has once again made headlines for his footwear. Cook recently wore a pair of customised Nike sneakers at the reopening of Apple’s flagship store in Tokyo. As reported by Business Insider, Cook was seen sporting a custom pair of Nike Vomero Plus sneakers at the company’s store opening in Japan. Some visitors at the store clicked photos and also made videos of the sneakers.As reported by Business Insider, Tim Cook’s Nike sneakers have red, white and blue colours. The sneakers are designed by Sashiko Gals, an artisan collective under the Japanese brand Kuon. The group consists of around 15 women aged between 40 and 80 and it specialises in sashiko, a traditional Japanese stitching technique.The sneakers are made using reworked denim and are a blend of modern sportswear with traditional craftsmanship. According to the designers, the pair was created exclusively for Cook.Presently, it is not clear that whether Nike is directly involved in the customisation process of the sneakers. However, Cook’s connection to the sportswear giant is longstanding—he has served on Nike’s board of directors since 2005. Over the years, Apple and Nike have collaborated on several projects, including fitness features and Apple Watch editions.This is not the first time that Cook has grabbed attention due to his sneakers. Last year, Cook wore another pair of one-of-a-kind Nike shoes at the time of the launch of new iPad lineup at an Apple event. The sightings suggest that Cook has access to a personal collection of rare, custom-designed sneakers, a perk few CEOs can claim.","Apple CEO Tim Cook has once again made headlines for his footwear.

Reebok is stepping back into the '90s with PlayStation for a limited-edition sneaker collaboration that's all about gaming nostalgia. The collection marks 30 years since Sony 's iconic console first hit the market, and it's doing so with three distinct silhouettes rolling out across Japan, the US, and UK this October.Each sneaker nods to the original PlayStation's launch timeline in its respective region. Japan gets the Instapump Fury 94—matching the console's 1994 debut there—complete with a ""Press Play"" pump ball and a tongue designed like a memory card. The US receives the Pump Omni Zone II, featuring a custom pump ball in classic PlayStation colours and hidden 1995 launch details. Meanwhile, the UK's Workout Plus incorporates the console's iconic circle, triangle, and square symbols as lace charms.The entire collection leans into that unmistakable PlayStation gray, pulling directly from the original console's colour scheme. Reebok's thrown in plenty of subtle touches too—metal lace tips, removable cable attachments, and anniversary sockliners that'll appeal to sneakerheads and gamers alike.""This collection is a time machine,"" said Mubi Ali, Reebok's global senior product marketing manager, describing it as a throwback to after-school gaming sessions, dial-up internet, and grunge playlists.The shoes drop in limited quantities through select retailers starting mid-October. The Workout Plus launches exclusively at END on October 15, followed by the Pump Omni Zone II at CNCPTS on October 17, and the Instapump Fury 94 at Beams on October 24. There's also a special stacking box set that bundles all three silhouettes for collectors.This marks another pop culture play for Reebok, following recent collaborations tied to ""Clueless"" and ""Gabby's Dollhouse.""

iOS26 now available: Things to know

Technical details could benefit competitors and repair shops







The Federal Communications Commission has accidentally published confidential iPhone 16e schematics online, despite Apple 's explicit request to keep the 163-page document sealed indefinitely. The leak, discovered Monday on the FCC's equipment authorisation database and mirrored by third-party site FCCID.io, exposes detailed electrical diagrams, chip configurations, antenna locations, and internal components that Apple warned could give competitors an ""unfair advantage. ""A cover letter dated September 16, 2024, shows Apple specifically asked the FCC to withhold the schematics from public view, stating they contain ""confidential and proprietary trade secrets."" The documents—clearly marked ""Apple Proprietary and Confidential"" on nearly every page—include block diagrams, electrical schematic diagrams, technical specifications, and tune-up procedures that Apple considers commercially sensitive even after product release.The leak likely resulted from an incorrect database setting during the certification filing process, according to reports from AppleInsider and 9to5Mac.Metadata indicates that both short-term and permanent confidentiality settings were marked as ""no,"" contradicting Apple's written request and triggering automatic publication by FCCID.io.While the schematics hold little value for average consumers, they could significantly benefit hardware researchers, independent repair shops, and competing smartphone manufacturers. The documents reveal board-level component routing, signal pathways between major chips, hidden traces within the logic board's ""sandwich"" construction, and test pad layouts—information that simplifies fault tracing and board-level repairs.Security researchers could also identify potential hardware attack surfaces previously unknown to the public. Although competitors could theoretically obtain similar information by purchasing and disassembling an iPhone 16e—released in February 2025—the official schematics eliminate guesswork and provide Apple's authoritative technical specifications.Neither Apple nor the FCC has commented on the disclosure. The Commission appears to have removed the document from its official equipment authorisation site, though copies remain circulated online.","The Federal Communications Commission accidentally published confidential iPhone 16e schematics online.

Reorg aims to accelerate Microsoft’s vision of Agentic OS





Microsoft is consolidating its Windows engineering divisions under a single organisation for the first time since 2018, as the company pushes toward creating what it calls an ""agentic OS"" powered by artificial intelligence.Windows chief Pavan Davuluri, recently promoted to president of Windows and devices, announced the restructuring in an internal memo obtained by The Verge. The reorganisation brings together teams working on Windows client and server, along with divisions handling Core OS, Data Intelligence and Fundamentals, Security, and Engineering Systems—all now reporting directly to Davuluri.""This change unifies Windows engineering work under a single organisation,"" Davuluri wrote, emphasising that consolidating these teams ""brings focus to delivering against our priorities.""The reunification reverses a 2018 decision that split Windows into separate divisions when former Windows chief Terry Myerson departed. At that time, Microsoft moved core Windows platform teams to Azure while client-facing features went to a new Experiences & Devices group. Though former Surface chief Panos Panay reclaimed some teams in 2020, most core engineering remained separate from consumer-facing Windows development until now.Some low-level components will still reside with Azure teams, including storage, networking, and the core kernel. ""We will continue to have dependencies from the core kernel and virtualisation and Linux teams, now part of Azure Core,"" Davuluri noted in the memo.The restructuring directly supports Microsoft's vision of transforming Windows into an AI-first platform. Davuluri stated the reorganisation would help ""deliver our vision of Windows as an Agentic OS""—referring to an operating system that can autonomously perform tasks on users' behalf.Microsoft has been aggressively integrating AI features into Windows 11, including the Windows AI Labs program for experimental capabilities, Copilot Vision tools, and an AI-powered Settings agent. The consolidated structure positions Davuluri to oversee this ambitious transformation as Microsoft reimagines its flagship operating system for the AI era.","Reorg aims to accelerate Microsoft’s vision of an Agentic OS.

What is Office Agent in Copilot chat





Microsoft has launched new features in its 365 Copilot, introducing Agent Mode in Office apps and Office Agent in Copilot chat. Announcing the new features, the company said the update is designed to bring “agentic productivity” to Office tools, allowing users to work with AI more interactively. With Agent Mode, available in Excel and Word, users can generate spreadsheets and documents directly within the apps by starting with a simple prompt and then refining results through iterative guidance. Support for PowerPoint will follow soon.The new Office Agent in Copilot chat, on the other hand, can create polished PowerPoint presentations and ready-to-use Word documents from a single prompt. Microsoft said Excel support will be added in the coming months. The company described the additions as the next step in human–AI collaboration, aimed at helping users complete multi-step tasks and produce higher-quality Office documents, spreadsheets and presentations more efficiently.Microsoft said Excel’s new Agent Mode is designed to make the app’s advanced features more accessible beyond expert users.
